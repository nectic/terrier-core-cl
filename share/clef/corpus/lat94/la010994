BELL LETTRES; SELECTED LETTERS OF VANESSA BELL, EDITED BY REGINA MARLER

 Bloomsbury. Has any other cultural coterie of our time been under such 
unrelenting scrutiny? Faced with its continuing charisma one conjures up an 
Edwardian model of People magazine that would have devoted an eight-page spread 
to the peccadilloes of these supposed social voluptuaries. The enlightened 
literati who spearheaded an aesthetic revolt against Victorian staidness and 
hypocrisy are due to their fame reduced to glitterati whose deeds and misdeeds 
will be savored like so many yummy canapes of scandalous gossip. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, a Merchant/Ivory film seems the more appropriate medium for a 
Bloomsbury entertainment. And from the evidence presented in "Selected Letters 
of Vanessa Bell," it is she and not her famed sister, Virginia Woolf, who would 
have the lead role. 
</P>
<P>
 In the introductory essays to this previously unpublished correspondence 
editor Regina Marler implicitly and correctly places Vanessa Bell at the 
group's center -- not so much regnant queen bee as quietly unifying presence. 
In what is a paradigm of scholarship Marler's scrupulous notes provide a spare 
biographical complement necessary to a full understanding of the letters. Such 
transitional bonding is easy to take in because the notes are situated on the 
pertinent pages themselves and not relegated to the back of the book. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell's letters can be read as an epistolary history of Bloomsbury. They make 
narrative sense and connect what was a loose confederation of writers, 
painters, economists and philosophers of common background and shared values. 
Briefly summarized, they were educationally related (mostly Cambridge), 
financially comfortable though not rich, connected by family or romantic 
liaison, politically indifferent for the most part to the prevailing ambitions 
of the British Empire, modernistic in their approach to the making of art, and 
sexually liberated (though essentially not promiscuous). 
</P>
<P>
 At the age of 25 upon the death of her parents, Bell relocated herself and her 
three younger siblings from Tony Kensington to bustling Bloomsbury in west 
central London. There, from the house at 46 Gordon Square, not far from the 
British Museum, she ran a household that in time became a central gathering 
place for her bright and creative friends. 
</P>
<P>
 She was the sort of woman who managed to remain on intimate terms with all her 
lovers -- the francophile art critic, Clive Bell, whom she married, whose name 
her children took, and with whose aesthetics she began; art theoretician Roger 
Fry with whom she had a passionate fling, and whose provocative ideas on art 
would affect her own; the primarily gay Duncan Grant who would become her true 
life's companion, with whom she painted, mounted art exhibitions and had her 
last child. 
</P>
<P>
 With Fry and Grant she founded the Omega Workshops, a bold and influential 
cultural experiment that reshaped English ideas of interior decoration and 
furniture design. She became a painter of note as well as an innovative 
designer of book covers, chiefly those of Leonard and Virginia Woolf's Hogarth 
Press. She raised her children in an ambience of social freedom and enduring 
maternal love. 
</P>
<P>
 If we understand the term feminist to mean a woman's survival on equal terms 
in a male-dominated society, then Bell was one, although not of the strident, 
polemicizing variety. In her work and in her personal relationships she 
functioned by candid and serene example. 
</P>
<P>
 A century ago letter writing was a leisurely pursuit whereby one's ideas and 
feelings could be communicated with unhurried grace. Such a humanist style was 
made to order for Vanessa. One wonders how she would have functioned in today's 
depersonalized world of terse phone and fax messages. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell tended to denigrate her own writing skills, often comparing her unadorned 
prose style unfavorably with Woolf's. These heartfelt letters, with their 
tonalities of sympathy and good sense, prove her wrong. High-flown figures of 
speech are seemingly avoided in favor of clarity. Marler points out that Bell 
and Woolf tacitly agreed to each other's turf -- one that of a pictorialist, 
the other of a wordsmith. Perhaps because of this reluctance to regard herself 
as a finished writer, Bell's letters do not readily lend themselves to 
excerpting. Each missive has its own gestalt. 
</P>
<P>
 "As none knows better than you," she wrote to Woolf, "only human news makes 
interesting letters, so don't expect much from me." 
</P>
<P>
 Expectations aside, with this volume Vanessa Bell, perhaps the most integral 
of all the "Bloomsberries," delivers the goods.

ARE YOU SHRIEKING?; LOVE FROM NANCY: THE LETTERS OF NANCY MITFORD, EDITED BY 
CHARLOTTE MOSLEY (HOUGHTON MIFFLIN: $35; 527 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Victoria Glendinning, Victoria Glendinning's most recent book is Anthony 
Trollope (Alfred A. Knopf, soon to be available in paperback from Penguin). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I can't do more than skate over surfaces, for one thing I am rather 
insensitive as you know, and for another not very clever." So why should anyone 
be interested in the letters of the English writer Nancy Mitford? First, 
because they are very funny and sometimes very sad. She writes with wit, energy 
and an uninhibited malice. Entirely without self-pity, she makes jokes when her 
heart is breaking. 
</P>
<P>
 The second reason for reading them is that they give access to an exclusive 
milieu, and an exclusive mentality. We tend to use the term middle class to 
mean elitist and privileged. In these letters, middle class means dowdy and 
common. The Mitfords are upper class. The difference is, or was, almost one of 
caste. Nancy's accent was so exaggeratedly cut-glass that she was unable to 
give radio talks; the listeners became enraged. If the shameless Mitford 
snobbery makes you want to throw up, approach the letters initially in a spirit 
of social anthropology. You will rapidly be seduced into reading for pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy only died in 1973, yet her world could not be further removed from the 
modern experience, whether British or American, if she had lived in the 18th 
Century. Louis XV, she said, was not so different in outlook from her own 
father. Nancy referred everything and everyone to her own circle. Her four 
historical biographies all read, according to one critic, like "further 
adventures of the Mitford family." Her first love was Hamish Erskine, a rakish 
homosexual younger than herself, and a character in her novel "Christmas 
Pudding" was Hamish "to the life," as she confessed in a letter. No nonsense 
here about separating the work from the life: "I'm writing a book about us when 
we were little," she wrote to her sister Jessica about her novel "The Pursuit 
of Love" (1945), which sold 200,000 copies in the first year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mitford family have become mythical to posterity, as they were to 
themselves. Born in 1904, Nancy Mitford was the eldest of the seven children of 
an eccentric English peer and his almost equally eccentric wife. The only boy 
was killed in World War II. The six girls, all good-looking, ran to extremes. 
Diana married the leader of the British Fascists, Sir Oswald Mosley, and shared 
his views. Unity became infatuated with Hitler and attempted suicide in Germany 
when hostilities broke out. Jessica went the other way and became a member of 
the Communist party. Deborah married into the purple and is the Duchess of 
Devonshire. Pamela, the least exotic, married the distinguished physicist Derek 
Jackson. All but Unity and Nancy are still living, and nearly all of them have 
written books, as did their friends. "How nice and clever we all are," Nancy 
wrote to the poet John Betjeman, with a characteristic mixture of pleasure and 
self-mockery. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy candidly confessed her literary limitations in letters to her great 
friend Evelyn Waugh: "Not enough intellect, no education and no technique." 
Waugh wrote in a review of her novel "The Blessing" that she had achieved "a 
patchy light culture and a way of writing so light and personal that it can 
almost be called a 'style.' " The same is true of her fluent, gossipy, teasing, 
outrageous letters. Over 8,000 have survived. This volume contains around 500, 
addressed to more than a hundred different people. She fully expected them to 
be published one day, and began annotating her correspondence in her later 
years. "Won't the editor of my letters have a jolly time, I often think," she 
wrote to her sister Diana. 
</P>
<P>
 The editor of Nancy's correspondence, Charlotte Mosley, is Nancy's nephew's 
wife. It was a sound plan to keep it in the family. Footnotes are needed to 
virtually every letter, explaining tribal jokes, nursery slang, coded 
abbreviations and the identities of the people referred to, usually by 
nicknames. Nor do Nancy's friends and family have just one nickname each; 
Deborah, for instance is variously Debo, Miss, Nine, Henderson or Hen. Diana is 
Bodley, Honks or Nard. You need to keep your wits about you. 
</P>
<P>
 There are probably not enough footnotes for American readers, nor for younger 
British ones, for whom a phrase like "bronco not bromo" must be hermetic. It 
has to do with varieties of toilet paper -- not a term that Nancy herself would 
have used. Toilet is grossly non-U, according to the half-joking analysis Nancy 
made of upper-class usage, which the general public fell upon with fascinated 
seriousness. In Nancy's circles, even toilet rolls were out of order, and soft 
or colored paper beyond all horror. Only interleaved sheets of old-fashioned 
prickly paper were socially acceptable. There is quite a bit of shrieking 
correspondence about this, as about other manifestations of the Modern Age. 
("What are jeans?") Like the complaints about servants and the unwarranted 
familiarity of waiters, it is all designed to amuse, but the nostalgia for an 
undemocratic lost world is genuine enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Politically, Nancy veered between her sisters' extremes, ending up vaguely 
left of center. Deeply conservative, she would be called, in today's Britain, a 
"champagne socialist." She denounced Diana to the authorities as a dangerous 
person, which led to Diana's imprisonment during the war; yet Diana was perhaps 
her favorite sister. Nancy's view was that "There isn't a pin to put between 
Nazis and Bolshies -- if one is a Jew one prefers one and if an aristocrat the 
other. Fiends." 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy's own "cause" was love -- eternal, unrequited love for Gaston Palewski, 
a short, squat French colonel who was head of General de Gaulle's cabinet in 
exile during the war. After the war, she went to live in Paris to continue her 
affair with Palewski, and stayed there for the rest of her life. Elegant and 
sociable, she embraced French culture, French fashions and French high society, 
enjoying smart parties in elegant Parisian houses ("such objets de musee on 
every hand, such food and such Dior dresses on such pretty silly ladies"). 
</P>
<P>
 Palewski was fond of her, but not in love and not faithful. He was terrified 
of scandal. They never traveled together, nor spent a whole night together. Her 
only hold over him was that she amused him -- so she had always to be witty and 
entertaining, concealing her pain. The saddest part of the story is toward the 
end, when she was diagnosed as having cancer in the same week that he told her 
he was finally getting married, and not to her. Nancy chose to see the 
marriage, and Palewski's wife, as nugatory: "She's a sort of dead person, an 
anti-person, always very amiable but with no apparent reason for being on this 
earth." 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy lived, in increasingly physical pain, for another five years. Her last 
letter, written half in French and half in English, was to Palewski. There is a 
final footnote: "Palewski was the last person to see her alive; he visited her 
in the morning and although she appeared to be unconscious, she smiled as he 
took her hand." Nancy in her letters constantly punctuates her jokey anecdotes 
with the question, "Are you shrieking?" meaning "Are you laughing?" By the end 
of this volume, paradoxically, the reader is close to tears.

THE DEMONS AND DREAMS IN OUR CITIES; INTERWOVEN DESTINIES: CITIES AND THE 
NATION, EDITED AND WITH AN INTRODUCTION BY HENRY G. CISNEROS (W. W. NORTON WITH 
THE AMERICAN ASSEMBLY: $25; 367 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Harold Meyerson, Harold Myerson is executive editor of the L.A. Weekly and a 
member of the editorial board of Dissent. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "We are becoming two nations," the Kerner Commission proclaimed in 1968, "one 
black and one white, separate and unequal." A quarter-century later, that 
stands as one of government's better predictions. We're not just black and 
white, of course; we're also Latino and Harold Meyerson is executive editor of 
the "L.A. Weekly" and a member of the editorial board of "Dissent."  
</P>
<P>
 Asian. Our separateness and inequality, however, have outrun the Commission's 
worst fears. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last 25 years, industry, decent-paying blue collar jobs and white 
people have all abandoned the American city. The major cities of both Frost 
Belt and Sun Belt are now majority minority: New York is 51% nonwhite; Houston, 
60%; Chicago, 62%; Los Angeles, 64%; Detroit, 80%. Those whites who remain 
within the city limits increasingly shun public institutions: The student 
population of the largest school districts, Harvard sociologist Nathan Glazer 
notes in this volume, is three-fourths nonwhite. And many whites are trying to 
include themselves out of those limits altogether. The Staten Island voters who 
made Republican Rudolph Giuliani mayor of New York last November were at the 
same time voting to secede. The San Fernando Valley voters who made Republican 
Richard Riordan mayor of L.A. last June were also seeking to break up the 
school district. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to a point, the new secessionists are fleeing demons of their own devising. 
(Polling taken immediately before the conclusion of the Koon-Powell retrial, 
for instance, showed that the greater one's distance from South-Central, the 
greater one's certitude of an impending riot.) Past that point, though, the 
demons -- crime, drugs, homelessness, poverty -- are plenty real, and many are 
growing worse. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, the American economy now clusters its poor in the cities. The 
single poorest Congressional district in the nation, for instance, is no longer 
to be found in the Mississippi Delta but right here in Los Angeles. Beginning 
in downtown and running down the Long Beach Freeway, Lucille Roybal-Allard's 
newly created district is home to a multitude of immigrant workers and families 
crammed into modest homes and even modester garages. As North Carolina business 
professor John Kasarda points out in this volume, only Detroit created more 
extremely poor census tracts during the '80s than Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, America's de facto apartheid is no more successful than South 
Africa's de jure variety. Try though we may, we cannot successfully quarantine 
the homeless, or keep riots confined to the poorer areas of the city, or even 
keep a madman from opening fire as his train crosses the Nassau County line. 
The very title of this collection of essays on the crisis of the American city 
insists that the one thing a nation cannot flee is itself, that the U.S. cannot 
return to anything like its postwar glory days without a concerted effort to 
rebuild its cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, while the remedies advanced in "Interwoven Destinies" go well beyond 
enterprise zones -- the minimalist strategy of the Reagan '80s -- they shun 
such notions as a Marshall Plan for cities. As such, they stand as a testament 
to the chastening of American liberalism. 
</P>
<P>
 For "Interwoven Destinies" is certainly the product of official liberalism, or 
at least its Realpolitik wing. A collection of papers by academics and 
activists commissioned for a conference of the American Assembly, it is edited 
by former San Antonio mayor and current Housing and Urban Development Secretary 
Henry Cisneros -- one of the more creative members of the Clinton cabinet -- 
with the able assistance of one of the nation's foremost urban planners, 
Cisneros brain-truster Marc Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
 And one thing of which the Clintonites are painfully aware is that aid to the 
cities has all the popularity of expanding the existing welfare program. To a 
sizable number of voters, urban assistance and welfare assistance both mean a 
transfer of taxpayer funds to them . To combat this reluctance, the authors 
take pains to point out that in most metropolitan areas, suburban and urban 
incomes tend to rise and fall in tandem. And their programmatic solutions, on 
the whole, tend to be as universal as they are city-specific. Much is made here 
of the need for industrial policy, training and apprenticeship programs, 
national health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the discussions of purely urban programs focus as much on public-private 
partnerships and citizen participation as they do on the role of government. 
Such policies as linkage -- in which commercial developers are required to 
build such social necessities as affordable housing, say, as a condition for 
being allowed to erect an office tower -- are extolled. (Though when an 
economy's as flat as L.A.'s has been, there's no growth to which the social 
necessities can be linked.) 
</P>
<P>
 A linchpin of current urban liberalism is the Community-Based Development 
Organization -- "a major source in the 1990's," writes urbanologist Paul 
Brophy, "for creating housing and neighborhood-scale commercial projects." 
"Interwoven Destinies" concludes with an essay by the Industrial Area 
Foundation's Ernesto Cortes, perhaps the foremost urban organizer of the past 
three decades. While banks have been shunning cities and city halls have seen 
their tax base erode, the IAF's largely church-based organizations have built 
houses and credit unions and, here in California, campaigned successfully to 
raise the minimum wage. In this, they are following the model of social 
unionism practiced by New York-based garment unions in the early part of the 
century. 
</P>
<P>
 The work that Cortes especially extols, however, is the work of politically 
organizing the largely unorganized, poorer sections of the city. Here, 
community-based organizations are all too often working in a vacuum. Critics 
who complain that the new immigrants are slow to acculturate should consider 
that there are precious few political organizations or unions left standing 
that could provide a point of entry into the larger society -- a situation 
quite unlike the one that greeted earlier generations of immigrants. The new 
urban poor are victims not only of a post-industrial economy but also of a 
post-participatory politics. 
</P>
<P>
 And if community-based organizations are not quite up to the task of 
re-politicizing the cities all by themselves, neither can they bring back the 
neighborhoods absent a major federal commitment to rebuilding American 
manufacturing. Many of the contributors to "Interwoven Destinies," who prepared 
their papers early last spring, assumed that the Clinton stimulus package would 
be enacted, that there would be some dollars to plug into these formulas for 
reconstruction. In fact, after the Congress made hash of the stimulus and 
finished putting five-year spending caps in the current budget, there wasn't 
any money for suburban renewal -- for such middle-class jobs programs as 
defense conversion -- let alone for the city. The challenge for the Realpolitik 
liberalism embodied by "Interwoven Destinies" is to evolve a strategy for 
overcoming the deficit mania of the American elite -- that continuation of 
Reaganism by other means that threatens to make city life in the Clinton '90s 
just as polarized and perilous as it was throughout the Reagan '80s.*

RICHARD EDER: LITERARY LEGALITIES; A FROLIC OF HIS OWN, BY WILLIAM GADDIS 
(POSEIDON: $25; 586 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Decade by decade, William Gaddis has taken the powerful organisms of our 
society and metastasized them into monstrosities. In the 1970s, "JR" turned the 
world of business into a nonstop gibbering nightmare. In the '80s, "Carpenter's 
Gothic" did something similar for the interlocking agencies of foreign policy, 
intelligence and international finance. Now, with "A Frolic of His Own," Gaddis 
makes the institutions and practices of the law into a cancer devouring the 
tissues of American life. 
</P>
<P>
 I counted at least 18 lawsuits going on in the latest of Gaddis's massive 
verbal tours de force, and I am sure to have missed some. So sparked and choked 
with language as to stand swaying between brilliant satire and an epileptic 
fit, it suggests "Bleak House" in a rewrite by James Joyce. The wit is as 
obsessive and implosive as in Gaddis's earlier books; at the same time, it is 
funnier, more absurdly believable, and more pointed in its attack. Perhaps this 
is because lawsuits and lawyers are more concrete and immediately recognizable 
to readers than the larger and more shadowy villainies Gaddis wrote about 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar Creavis, an egocentric professor and author of an unpublished Civil War 
play, sues a Hollywood studio for making an epic that somewhat resembles his 
drama. Oscar's pursuit of his case, which is the book's central motif, suggests 
a fat fly strutting into a spider web and being meticulously sucked dry. As 
with Dickens' Jarndyce vs. Jarndyce, by the time the lawyers have finished with 
it they have it all, and their victorious client has nothing, or less. 
</P>
<P>
 Around this main display flares a galaxy of far-fetched legal constellations. 
Oscar was run over by his own car while he stood in front of it and tried to 
hot-wire it. An incompetent contingency lawyer manages to have him sue himself. 
The Episcopal Church sues Pepsi-Cola for hundreds of millions of dollars on the 
grounds that the soft drink's name is an exact anagram of its own. A society 
woman harassed by an abortion protester sues him for endangering her fetus; 
after getting the abortion, she is sued by her lover for infringing his 
paternity rights. A sculptor, who erected an angular steel art-work in a 
Southern town-square, takes out an injunction to stop the authorities from 
removing a section after a boy's dog wanders into it and can't get out. When 
lightning hits the art-work and kills Spot, the dog, the boy sues the town. He 
also demands royalties from the manufacturers of a Spot board game and "Save 
Spot" T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Oscar, he funnels all his frustrations and grandiose expectations into 
his plagiarism suit. Confined to a wheelchair in his dilapidated Long Island 
mansion and surrounded by a chaos of papers and unattended bills, he drinks 
heavily, and obsessively watches fish documentaries on PBS. He is tended by 
Lila, his flaky young mistress, who keeps borrowing money while awaiting the 
outcome of a couple of lawsuits of her own; and by Christina, his 
long-suffering sister. The only fully human character in this bestiary of 
Gorgons and faces-turned-to-stone, Christina is torn in concern for her brother 
and for her workaholic, pill-swigging lawyer husband. His posh firm, Swyne & 
Doar, just happens to represent the studio that Oscar is suing. 
</P>
<P>
 All of Gaddis's writing conveys, by a mix of bludgeon and subcutaneous shock 
treatment, an America gone bad or mad. Oscar is of the mad variety; by lineage 
he is a piece of American history, by temperament he is the artist/intellectual 
blinded by foolishness and vanity as much as by the corruption around him. 
</P>
<P>
 His grandfather, a Confederate veteran, was a Supreme Court justice whose 
fiery idealism fought Oliver Wendell Holmes's cool insistence that the Court's 
business was law, not justice. The grandfather had seen what law could do. For 
a complicated series of reasons he left the Confederate Army, sent a substitute 
in his place -- this was legal -- and later, in the North, hired a substitute 
to serve in the Union Army. At Antietam, the two substitutes met and killed 
each other. The story is told in Oscar's play and jazzed up in the film. 
</P>
<P>
 Oscar's father, a 90-year-old Federal District judge, has made generational 
war against his own father. Out-Holmesing Holmes, his elaborately elegant 
opinions are legalistic to the point of scandal. Presiding over the sculpture 
suits, he rules against both dog and boy; and prompts his state's Jesse 
Helms-like senator to demand his impeachment for announcing that God has no 
place in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of Oscar's suit is comedy that turns steadily darker. He gets a 
relatively inexpensive lawyer named Basie, but inexpensive means $100 or $150 
an hour instead of $300 or $400. The hours mount into the hundreds as Basie 
spends weeks in California deposing the film makers, and submits to Oscar's 
lordly insistence that he sit and listen to his play being read aloud. Basie, 
who is enigmatic and possibly crooked or possibly brilliant, or both, is 
initially skeptical of the case and then insists on pursuing it. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal ins and outs are, perhaps surprisingly, fascinating. The case is 
lost, and then won on appeal. Oscar is awarded a share of the film's profits 
that seems stupendous to anyone who does not know Hollywood's distinction 
between "gross" and "net." Even when the court increases the award -- the law 
also kills when it tries to be kind -- Oscar ends up near-ruined. As for 
Christina, her husband is dead of overwork, and the piggish Swyne & Doar, where 
he had slaved to make partner, is the named beneficiary of his life insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The successive shoves by which the lawyers and the law propel Oscar on his 
downward spiral are ghastly, often comic and quite enough to deter anyone who 
is not a junior werewolf from entering law school; and to persuade anyone else 
to settle grievances with a duel or trial by ordeal. But all this gives only a 
partial idea of Gaddis's book. Besides his outsized and ingenious story of 
legal horror there is the writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Characteristic in Gaddis is the high-pitched state of paranoid sub-hysteria 
evoked by his narrative. It is carried almost entirely by the voices of his 
characters; voices that intersect, run together, break apart; mostly without 
quotation marks or identification of who is speaking, or when one voice gives 
way to another. If somebody enters a room or moves a chair or eats -- obsessive 
shopping, cooking and eating go on nonstop in the Oscar menage -- the 
information is slipped indistinguishably into the torrent of speech. The author 
will not help us, we feel; baleful forces have kidnaped him. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a spoken stream of consciousness and powerfully suggests the mental and 
moral dilapidation inflicted upon the characters. It is also dreadfully 
punishing and, over 500 pages, it wears itself down; not to mention the reader. 
It has a shout in it, but after a while we may register the shout not in our 
ears or minds but in our sore bones. 
</P>
<P>
 It can be a relief, in fact, when we come to three long judicial opinions that 
Gaddis has invented, as well as the text of Oscar's deposition before two 
opposing lawyers. They are brilliantly done: the opinions in their orotund 
judicial wit, and the deposition in its endless comic pettifoggery. I'm not 
sure whether they are entertaining in a boring sort of way or boring in an 
entertaining sort of way. But there is a sudden freshness when Gaddis uses 
speech as a formal and dramatic expression instead of as prolonged internal 
weather which is, between its great flashes, enervating stretches of heat 
lightning.

COVER STORY: BACK TO THE '70S -- RAW AND UNCUT; ARMISTEAD MAUPIN'S 
FREE-WHEELING 'TALES' AIR ON PBS -- VIA GREAT BRITAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BART MILLS, Bart Mills is a Los Angeles-based free-lance writer who

<TEXT>
<P>
 Is America ready for a six-hour miniseries depicting uncloseted gays leading 
ordinary and largely happy lives? Can we stand to see sexual frankness, hear 
four-letter-word dialogue and practically smell the marijuana being smoked on 
screen? 
</P>
<P>
 The British think we're ready at last. Seventeen years after Armistead Maupin 
began writing a daily fictional column in the San Francisco Chronicle called 
"Tales of the City," the British commercial network Channel Four came to 
America to dramatize it. PBS' "American Playhouse" airs "Tales" on three 
consecutive nights of clever talk and weird doings by unconventional characters 
of every sexual coloration. 
</P>
<P>
 Set in the gaudy days before AIDS, "Tales" interweaves the lives of the 
tenants of a wide-open San Francisco boardinghouse whose landlady grows more 
than enough marijuana for them all. There is the young woman fresh from 
Cleveland who finds that the dishy guy she meets at the supermarket is more 
interested in boys...the middle-aged executive who finds that love is stranger 
than he imagined ... the gynecologist who cruises at the roller rink...the 
model whose lesbianism isn't her darkest secret. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tales" was shot on location in San Francisco and in a studio in Los Angeles 
where the Russian Hill boardinghouse was re-created. During a break in shooting 
in L.A., Laura Linney, the blue-eyed blond who plays the recent arrival from 
the Midwest, says, "My character is the one who gets to discover everything for 
the audience." The mood ring Linney wears as part of her '70s costume flashes a 
contented shade of blue as she explains, "For her, it's like arriving in a new 
country. She loses her predetermined fears and judgments and learns that you 
grow from meeting people who aren't the same as you." 
</P>
<P>
 Just out of college herself, Linney remembers the '70s only dimly but revels 
in the chance to learn about herbal shampoo and Joe Namath. "The '70s were a 
big party when people tried to reap the benefits of the social revolution of 
the '60s. When they took drugs, it was a part of the celebration. Later, drugs 
became a way to hide, and that's why society's attitude has changed." 
</P>
<P>
 "American Playhouse" had only an advisory role in the production, executive 
producer Lindsay Law says. "I was asked years ago to help develop this book but 
I didn't. I've been out of the miniseries business for several years because of 
'American Playhouse's' problems financing them. It's spectacular that Channel 
Four made the commitment to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's such different and refreshing material. It's not a heavy dramatic piece 
-- it's a lark. It tells its story honestly, though it's considerably tamer 
than life as it really was in San Francisco then." Asked what rating "Tales" 
might get if it were a film, Law speculates, "Nudity and the F-word usually get 
you an R. It would be right on the line between PG-13 and R." 
</P>
<P>
 These days Hollywood hardly ever depicts lighthearted drug use, and television 
doesn't at all. In mainstream films leading characters are virtually never gay. 
If they are, they're villains as in "JFK" or AIDS patients as in 
"Philadelphia." This is the major novelty in "Tales" and the reason it took so 
long to get on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Published in book form in 1978, it was optioned by Warner Bros. but eventually 
dropped. Attempts to sell the story to the networks were futile. HBO held the 
option for a long time but backed off in the end. After Maupin's books became 
bestsellers in Britain, the upscale Channel Four (which also backed "The Crying 
Game") picked it up and put $8 million into it. 
</P>
<P>
 The British producing group brashly chose to film in San Francisco and Los 
Angeles with a virtually all-American cast. But director Alastair Reid is 
British and the script adheres to British standards of literary fidelity. 
Maupin, who observed filming on location in San Francisco and in a studio in 
Los Angeles, says, "There's more freedom in Britain to film stories of modern 
life in an honest way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was naive about Hollywood at first. I assumed that the revolution that 
happened in my life had also happened here. In the end, I didn't want any 
Hollywood money in this production because that would have meant Hollywood 
censorship." 
</P>
<P>
 Maupin, who can be glimpsed for a few seconds in "Tales" looking out a window 
and observing his characters, is a stocky, soft-spoken Vietnam vet from North 
Carolina. He came out of the closet in the early '70s in San Francisco and 
worked at various jobs before beginning his "Tales of the City" column in the 
Chronicle in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tales" aired to acclaim in Britain last fall, and Channel Four is preparing 
to film the second in Maupin's sextet of "City" tales, "More Tales of the City" 
(Daryl Hannah has bought the movie rights to his most recent novel, "Maybe the 
Moon"). 
</P>
<P>
 Why did it take the British to get this very American material on the screen? 
In Britain, says co-producer Antony Root, "Television grows out of a tradition 
of public service, while America's comes from a tradition of selling goods. 
</P>
<P>
 "Britain has the capacity to fund productions for minority audience channels 
at the level of a majority channel. If you tried to sell a six-hour adaptation 
of a writer like Paul Auster in America, it couldn't be funded at the level of 
Judith Krantz. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we chose Richard Kramer, an American who had written for 
'thirtysomething,' to adapt Maupin for us, he was astonished to hear us tell 
him that we'd lose our finance if he cut the four-letter words out or limited 
the gay material. American adapters are expected to change the source material. 
The British tradition involves keeping the tone of the original. I think he was 
exhilarated by our requirements for fidelity." 
</P>
<P>
 "Tales of the City" airs on "American Playhouse" Monday-Wednesday on KCET and 
KPBS at 9 p.m.

HISTORY AND THE PLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kim Murphy, undoubtedly unintentionally, has followed the long-held propaganda 
line of the PLO ("The Divided House of Arafat," Dec. 5). For years the PLO has 
couched its actions in military language: Its attacks were "military 
operations," and the casualties were "soldiers." 
</P>
<P>
 But euphemistic language cannot negate the facts. The "soldiers" were 
terrorists, and the "military operations" were terrorist attacks. The scores of 
slain civilians -- worshiping in synagogues, shopping at marketplaces, riding 
on buses or dining in restaurants when they were attacked -- were innocent men, 
women and children. 
</P>
<P>
 Past bitterness can prevent future progress, and we must move on from here. 
But history cannot be ignored, nor should it be rewritten.

 Murphy eloquently explains the message President John F. Kennedy intended to 
deliver at the Dallas Trade Mart: "There will always be dissident voices heard 
in the land, expressing opposition without alternatives, finding fault but 
never favor, perceiving gloom on every side and seeking influence without 
responsibility."

THEATER; HOMETOWN BOY MAKES WAVES; AFTER A THREE-YEAR ABSENCE IN NEW YORK TO 
HELM TV'S 'LAW & ORDER,' PRODUCER JOE STERN HAS RETURNED TO HIS ROOTS AND HIS 
FIRST LOVE, THE L.A. THEATER SCENE, TO WORK WITH 'THE GREATEST TALENT POOL OF 
ACTORS IN THE WORLD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Joseph Stern is back and he's mad as hell and not going to let us take it 
anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "The actor is an endangered species," producer Stern is saying, standing on 
the deck of his Pacific Palisades home. "Between the economy, the lack of 
funding, and its effect on our standards, actors are not practicing their art. 
They're not doing something else. They're not directing, or writing their 
memoirs. They're just waiting for the next gig." 
</P>
<P>
 Stern lists actors who quit the profession. He mentions stars who live in Los 
Angeles, yet never work on local stages. He speaks rapid-fire, sounding more 
adolescent than middle-aged, despite his 53 years. 
</P>
<P>
 After a three-year absence while working as co-executive and executive 
producer of the New York-based NBC-TV series "Law & Order," Stern has returned 
to his hometown and his first love, the theater, specifically, his own theater, 
the Matrix, at 7657 Melrose Ave., where he's currently producing a critically 
acclaimed revival of George M. Cohan's 1920 melodrama "The Tavern." (The show 
continues through Feb. 13.) 
</P>
<P>
 Despite two Emmy and two Golden Globe nominations for "Law & Order," Stern 
left the show feeling he had "done all I could, and I didn't feel we had the 
same goals anymore." Among the very few theater producers who straddle stage 
and screen, Stern continues to balance both arenas more effectively than any 
other theater producer in Los Angeles. Last fall, while preparing to mount "The 
Tavern" at the Matrix, Stern simultaneously produced the controversial "Other 
Mothers," the "CBS Schoolbreak Special" about lesbians parenting a high school 
boy. 
</P>
<P>
 A key mover and shaker during the phenomenal 1980s boom in Southern California 
theater, Stern was at that time both a leader and a rebel. 
</P>
<P>
 While mounting stage productions under his Actors for Themselves banner that 
earned 19 Los Angeles Drama Critics Circle Awards, including the prestigious 
Margaret Harford Award for lifetime achievement, Stern accused Actors' Equity 
of not supporting Southern California theater producers, publicly dueled with 
Mark Taper Forum artistic director Gordon Davidson (claiming that the Taper was 
not, at the time, using enough local talent), and demanded better working 
conditions for actors. Always, if there was a panel discussion, Stern was on 
it; call a debate, and he led the argument. Ask for a provocative statement, 
and he wrote the newspaper a letter. Stern could always be counted on to name 
names. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been missed here. "I've been told there's a tightening of the belt (in 
L.A.) because of the economy," Stern says. "Colleagues date it back to the 
riots, for whatever reason, and they feel the audience has seen too much bad 
theater. The audience is smaller. It's not just the economy. It may be trust in 
the product. They've been burned too many times. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the greatest talent pool (of actors) in the world is right here in Los 
Angeles," Stern declares with rising emphasis. "It certainly isn't in New York. 
While living there for the last three years, I saw some 70 shows, and talked to 
a number of people, and auditioned some 6,000 actors. You can't tell me the 
work is better there than in Los Angeles. This is where the talent pool is. . . 
. How do we get them back on stage?" 
</P>
<P>
 Stern's solution was to form the Matrix Theatre Company, a repertory company 
of industry actors who, thanks to lucrative television and movie salaries, can 
afford to work in the theater for free. His model for this is Kenneth Branagh's 
Renaissance Theatre Company in London, a core resident company that enlists 
movie actors for various projects. But the problem, of course, is that 
in-demand performers frequently leave shows for paying industry jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Stern solved this problem by double-casting "The Tavern." That meant finding 
not just 15 actors, but 30. Each role has a minimum of two actors in 
alternating performances. When one actor's agent calls with a job, another 
actor steps in. But if you cast actors the level of Marian Mercer ("It's a 
Living") and David Dukes ("The Mommies"), their alternates must be equal in 
talent. Such casting would be the envy of any theater in the world, let alone a 
not-for-profit 99-seat house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew double-casting was the only hope if I was going to get a great company 
of actors," Stern remembers. "That way, they're not missing a job. During the 
rehearsal period, some 15 or 20 jobs came up. Half of (the actors) were out at 
one point. Jim Haynie, Mitch Ryan -- each had one or two jobs where they left 
for a few days. Talia Balsam missed the first week of previews. Charles 
Hallahan is in 'Grace Under Fire.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, this unpredictability made the rehearsal process more 
cooperative and less competitive. Director Tony Giordano, who initially 
proposed "The Tavern" to Stern while observing a "Law & Order" location shoot, 
described the experience by phone from his New York apartment: "I viewed it as 
a big gamble. Though it was frustrating to lose people for days (to industry 
jobs) while I continued to progress through the rehearsal process, I expected 
that. But when they were in rehearsals, those actors were there a 
hundred-thousand percent of the time. Many times they came on their days off 
and observed rehearsals." 
</P>
<P>
 Penny Fuller, who plays the madwoman in "The Tavern," agrees with Giordano's 
assessment. "It's a wonderful way to have a sense of community without the 
financial or creative sacrifice," says the actress who first worked for Stern 
in 1982 in an award-winning production of Harold Pinter's "Betrayal" at the 
Matrix. "On my off-days, I would watch Lindsay Crouse (Fuller's double), and 
then we'd talk about the part and share ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 "And there's no billing problem," Stern says of the traditional backstage 
vanity battles producers generally must endure. "An environment of such 
generosity has been created. We've proved that if you can eliminate the ego and 
the competitiveness -- we've done about 80% of that -- you can achieve the most 
amazing things. The biggest problem was finding younger actors. . . . The great 
majority just didn't get it. If they read the play, they didn't get the play. 
There's just a lack of skilled young people. It was eye-opening." 
</P>
<P>
 This realization saddened Stern. "When I was a young actor, I worked under 
major actors. That was another purpose (of the company), to pass on tradition. 
Basically, there's just more and more actors over 40 quitting the business. The 
quality of television and movies is so awful because it's now come down to 
producers saying, 'Get me a (guild minimum) scale actor.' They tell great 
character actors, 'If you don't work for scale, buddy, we'll get the next guy.' 
</P>
<P>
 "We're talking about artists here! We're talking about 30 years of skill, of 
life! But the television and film producers don't give a (expletive)! I'll go 
on record! They just say, 'If you won't do it, someone else will.' 
</P>
<P>
 "What always turned me on in the theater was great actors," Stern says with a 
sad sigh. "That's what got me. Always. That is what changed my life." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stern was born in Los Angeles in 1940 and was raised two blocks from the 
Matrix Theatre. Throughout his education at Fairfax High, Los Angeles City 
College and UCLA, Stern repeatedly performed in school plays and emceed public 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 After being released from the Army reserves in 1964, he flew to New York and 
auditioned at Joseph Papp's Public Theatre. His ambition was to become a 
professional Shakespearean actor. Papp obliged. Three weeks after getting his 
first paid acting job, Stern married his college girlfriend, Peppy. (This year 
the Sterns will celebrate their 30th wedding anniversary with their two sons.) 
</P>
<P>
 At the New York Shakespeare Festival, while carrying spears in crowd scenes, 
Stern became close friends with another unknown actor, William Devane. Soon 
Stern and Devane formed a nonprofit production company called Actors for 
Themselves. In the early 1970s, Stern was cast in a network series starring 
Karen Valentine and moved back to Los Angeles. He was subsequently fired from 
the show, and in the process realized that acting wasn't his primary calling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just a working actor," Stern says. "I never wanted it bad enough. I was 
always very precocious at school, but in the real world I knew I could never be 
great at it. I thought I had an instinct for conducting, for putting everybody 
together, and had a real instinct for behavior. I always felt I knew who had 
talent. I was never afraid to make decisions. And I was never afraid of 
failing. I'd always been a gambler." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1975, actor-writer Allan Miller asked Stern to help produce a play in Los 
Angeles, "Are You Now or Have You Ever Been . . . ?" Stern brought his friend 
Devane west to direct, and their production ran for a record-breaking 14 months 
before moving to Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, Stern discovered the Matrix, and learned that the ensemble that was 
playing there was struggling to survive. He and Devane borrowed money from 
Stern's salesman father and bought the theater and allowed the company to 
continue. Meanwhile, Stern was also head of development and production for Dan 
Curtis Productions, a television production company, from 1977 to 1982, 
participating in the making of the hit miniseries "The Winds of War," and 
receiving an Emmy nomination for producing the first season of "Cagney & Lacey" 
for Orion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, Devane traded his half of the Matrix to a dentist for an Arabian 
racehorse. Stern soon after bought out the dentist and became sole owner of the 
Matrix. The ensemble company left and his professional double-life debuted, 
with Stern juggling pilots for Curtis Productions with plays such as David 
Mamet's "A Life in the Theatre" for the Matrix. Throughout the '80s, his Actors 
for Themselves productions at the Matrix -- notably the world premiere of Lyle 
Kessler's "Orphans" and Simon Gray's "The Common Pursuit" -- garnered numerous 
rewards and international attention. He produced the feature film "Dad" for 
Steven Spielberg's Amblin Productions, and the television movie "Into Thin 
Air," starring Ellen Burstyn. The decade ended with Stern's ABC special "The 
Perfect Date" winning two Emmys. 
</P>
<P>
 Stern, who throughout this time was living in L.A., was careful never to allow 
the Matrix to become an industry showcase. But feedback and cross-pollination 
often occurred. For example, Stern hired Lee Shallat to direct the West Coast 
premiere of Larry Shue's "Wenceslas Square" at the Matrix (1989) as well as 
last year's after-school special, "Other Mothers." 
</P>
<P>
 Now a director for "Murphy Brown," Shallat says of Stern: "Joe is really 
responsible for getting me my first break in television. He's amazingly 
generous and almost vociferous in his desire to get people to work together. 
Joe makes people better by his passion and by his demand for quality and his 
unrelenting tenacity." 
</P>
<P>
 But Stern's tenacity has also made him more than a few enemies. Some actors 
and directors he has worked with have claimed that his obsessive perfectionism 
is destructive. Others say his "hands on" style is manipulative. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm there to force you to be better," Stern retorts to such accusations, "not 
to make you better. I've never given anybody their talent. But I try to make 
you go to your capacity. I'm like a coach that way. I don't allow you to quit." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, while producing his three-play season (the two works to follow "The 
Tavern" are still in the process of being confirmed), Stern will also pursue 
his own television series. "If I want to keep this house," he says, gesturing 
at his family's recently purchased Pacific Palisades home, "then I'd better 
work in television. I have enough money to get me through a couple of years. I 
never owned a house before, purposely, because I didn't want to have to take 
that bad job." 
</P>
<P>
 Playwright Mayo Simon recalls a party at Stern's rented apartment in the 
1980s. Simon marveled that a successful television producer would not own a 
home. "Joe doesn't buy homes," said his wife, Peppy. "Joe buys theaters." 
</P>
<P>
 Now Stern is tenaciously pushing forward his Matrix Theatre Company. His 
all-star company is currently involved in meetings to decide how to proceed in 
a quasi-democratic process that fits Stern's style. 
</P>
<P>
 What next? 
</P>
<P>
 "In another six months, I'll probably shoulder my satchel and hold out my hand 
and figure out how to get some money to run the Matrix," says Stern, who this 
time around has relied only on his own savings and ticket sales to operate. "I 
don't know what the answer is, but I feel for the American actor. I really do. 
And I do believe they're an endangered species."

MATADORS AND TOROS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is refreshing to read an accurate portrayal of the world of bullfighting, 
warts and all, written by someone well equipped to discuss the subject ("The 
Reckless Valor of Juan Antonio Ruiz," by Jonathan Kandell, Dec. 5). Kandell's 
description of Ruiz's disastrous week is quite a departure from the usual 
depiction of endless parties, luxury and glory -- the romantic life of a 
matador. And the portrait of the sensitive Ruiz is not that of the matador as a 
sadistic monster, as painted by some opponents of bullfighting. 
</P>
<P>
 However, bullfighting is not a sport. It is a spectacle, a tragedy, an 
extravaganza, a performance, a drama, a ritual, a ceremony, a ballet of death 
or an art -- but never a sport.

</P>
<P>
 Because of the long tribute to the heroic deeds and suffering of Ruiz, it's 
only fair to mention the heroism and pain of his opponent -- the bull. 
</P>
<P>
 According to People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, the bull, before 
entering the ring, is given strong laxatives and tranquilizers to weaken it. 
Petroleum jelly is rubbed into its eyes to blur its vision. After being 
handicapped in various other ways, it is ready to face the brave matador. 
</P>
<P>
 During the "contest," two heavy darts with fishhook points are implanted into 
the bull's neck muscles to tear its flesh whenever it moves. The accompanying 
picador , who rides a blindfolded horse with its ears stuffed with wet 
newspapers and its vocal cords cut, will then slice a four-inch-wide hole along 
the bull's backbone. A lance will be inserted into this hole and rotated four 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for an occasional goring by an unsportsmanlike bull, the bullfighter 
usually wins.

<P>

</P>
<P>
 If the matadors and managers are complaining about the lack of stamina and 
aggressiveness of today's toros , why don't they show some true courage, forgo 
the ritualistic torture and face a healthy, rested bull? 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 The bullfight is pagan savagery masquerading as noble tradition. Along with 
other relics of human ignorance, such as female circumcision and the electric 
chair, the bullfight must go. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 So a bull that enters an arena and doesn't want to fight is a "fraud." I say 
that word better describes the sadistic little creature in tights who 
repeatedly skewers the bull -- and believes that all this makes him a man.

 We should all boycott Spain and Spanish products until this torture and murder

disguise animal abuse as an acceptable cultural more.

 Much of Spain's contemporary population turns away from this sadistic sport in 
disgust, consigning it to the thoughtlessness and viciousness of another era. 
Kandell's article perpetuates antagonistic myths and stereotypes that equate 
Spaniards with mindless savagery. Spain today is a vital and thriving nation 
whose sons and daughters have made invaluable and lasting contributions to 
Western culture.

AN INTERRUPTED HERITAGE; STUBBORN TWIG: THREE GENERATIONS IN THE LIFE OF A 
JAPANESE AMERICAN FAMILY, BY LAUREN KESSLER (RANDOM HOUSE: $25; 368 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Donna Kato, Donna Kato, based in San Jose, writes frequently about the 
Japanese-American community.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Here is a book that entices readers first to look at the pages of photographs 
slipped into a middle chapter. One studies the dress and faces of the Yasui 
family through nearly 100 years, then comes away with a curiosity: Who are 
they? What makes them so compelling? 
</P>
<P>
 Part social history and part family biography, "Stubborn Twig" traces the 
tragic and triumphant saga of a Japanese-American family. Lauren Kessler 
transports us to another era, accurately and vividly, then places Yasui family 
members within that time frame, letting us get to know one or two of them. 
Sadly, most of these vignettes center around an economic hardship or a racial 
conflict that ultimately ends in the humiliation of a Yasui. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stubborn Twig" is an uncomfortable book to read. For Japanese Americans, 
learning about the racism that confronted the Yasuis may be a reminder of 
similar incidents in their own families. The book personalizes events in 
American history that are easier to acknowledge if the facts remain faceless. 
With the Yasuis, we get to know fathers, sons, mothers and daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 The author's background as a journalism professor is reflected in her clean, 
organized writing style. Although Kessler writes with sensitivity about a 
family she has known as personal friends, there is an objectivity that seems to 
keep us from getting too involved with a character. We can empathize, but we 
can't quite embrace any of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps this is because the book is broad in scope, encompassing nearly a 
century and the points of view of more than a dozen characters. In making sure 
that readers understand the historic context, Kessler sometimes fails to give 
us the personal motivation behind a character's actions or feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stubborn Twig" opens with a textbook explanation of the circumstances that 
led to Asian immigration at the turn of the century. It then shifts focus to 
Masuo Yasui, who sails from Japan to join his two older brothers already 
working on a railroad crew around the Northwest. Unlike most Japanese men who 
simply wanted to earn and save money to return to Japan, 16-year-old Masuo 
intends to make America his home even though laws bar him from becoming a 
citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Masuo is 21, he has left the railroad to work as a cook and a 
houseboy. He has converted to Christianity and speaks semi-fluent English. 
Settling in Hood River, Ore., he talks his brothers into opening a general 
store to serve the needs of the area issei (first generation Japanese) migrant 
farm laborers. 
</P>
<P>
 At age 25, Masuo sends for his bride, a woman he knew as a child. Shidzuyo 
Miyake and Masuo have not seen each other in more than a decade, but have been 
corresponding for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Landing in Tacoma in September of 1912, Shidzuyo begins married life in a 
foreign country as the wife of a man with a rather uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
 Kessler tells us that Shidzuyo was a teacher in Japan, a rare accomplishment 
for a woman of that time. It's clear that she's headstrong and bright, throwing 
away any chance of a conventional marriage to come to America. But Kessler 
doesn't give us a hint of what must have been going through Shidzuyo's mind as 
she disembarked from the ship, seeing a new country and a new husband for the 
first time. From this point on, Shidzuyo becomes a wife and mother, 
disappointingly relegated to the background of the Yasui tale. 
</P>
<P>
 A year after her arrival in Hood River, Shidzuyo gives birth to a son, Kay, 
the first of nine children born to the couple. Masuo, meanwhile, begins 
acquiring orchard land in the name of his offspring. With his business savvy 
and command of the English language, he is also becoming an important force in 
the development of Hood River's fruit industry and a respected adviser to the 
area's Japanese farmers. But because of his Asian face, Masuo cannot gain full 
acceptance into a society that still considers real Americans to be those of 
European descent. While the majority of the white Americans in Hood River are 
portrayed as greedy and prejudiced, there are those, such as lawyer E. C. 
Smith, who are loyal friends to the Japanese Americans even through the 
internment years. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, too, Kessler could have enriched the story by letting us know why 
residents such as Smith risked ostracism and financial disaster to help the 
Yasuis. Because there were so few Caucasians who spoke out in behalf of 
Japanese Americans (especially during World War II) their names and deeds are 
of great interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yasui children, the second generation, grow up in a volatile and 
contradictory environment. Their parents instill in them the Japanese virtues 
of self-sacrifice and discipline, but at the same time encourage them to fit 
into the sphere of their white classmates. They are given a mixed message to be 
overachievers but always to remember their second-class place in America. 
</P>
<P>
 It proves too much for Kay, who, as the first born, has a predestined and 
honored placed within the family. As heir, he has special privileges, but also 
enormous responsibilities, especially toward his younger siblings. Kay commits 
suicide at age 17 following a reprimand from his father. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this pivotal family tragedy and constant economic setbacks, the Yasuis 
thrive, even moving to an "uptown" house and sending all the children to 
college. What could have been, however, is irrevocably altered on Dec. 7, 1941. 
</P>
<P>
 In the chapters that cover the war and internment, Kessler chronicles how each 
Yasui fares during that period. As a community leader, Masuo falls under 
suspicion and is whisked away by government authorities to a federal detention 
center. Min, his third eldest son, is a lawyer in Portland. He, too, lands in 
prison when he decides to test the constitutionality of an 8 p.m. curfew. To 
Japanese Americans, Min Yasui is a familiar name -- his stand might be compared 
to the one taken by Rosa Parks when she boarded the bus in Montgomery, Ala. 
Kessler makes it clear that he is a hero in his family, but the fact that he's 
a well-known activist and leader revered by thousands of Japanese Americans 
doesn't come across in the book. 
</P>
<P>
 When the internment orders come, the college-age Yasui children receive 
permission to attend schools in the East and Midwest while Shidzuyo and the 
younger children are sent to Tule Lake on the Oregon-California border. Here, 
Kessler expertly weaves the Yasuis into the now familiar backdrop of 
evacuation. What was once a rather anonymous term, evacuees now describes a 
family we know well -- and we painfully watch as they are torn apart by the 
chaos of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The final section brings us to the grandchildren of Masuo and Shidzuyo, a 
generation of Yasuis who have difficulty understanding the values and ethics of 
their elders. They live in a time of opportunity, in a country that's far more 
accepting of ethnic diversity. Still, Kessler writes, they care deeply about 
their family's heritage and it was their desire to pass on a written record. It 
is a rich and complex heritage they have shared with Kessler and the readers of 
her book.

'DISCRETION IS ADVISED FOR ANYONE WHO MISSED THE 1970S'

 "Tales of the City" will offer the most sexually frank images ever seen on 
U.S. broadcast television. A long dialogue scene is played topless on a bed.Men 
French-kiss passionately in a car. Nude men jog and play Frisbee on the beach. 
A sympathetic character sniffs cocaine and suffers no consequences. Everyone 
uses four-letter words. 
</P>
<P>
 Such material is commonplace in R-rated films available on cable. But 
broadcast TV, even PBS, has hardly ever broken any of these taboos. 
</P>
<P>
 Two versions of the show are being offered to PBS affiliates. KCET plans to 
air the "uncut" version, which is the one that was shown in Britain, except 
that three four-letter words are replaced with euphemisms. In the "soft feed" 
alternative, a further 15 or so four-letter utterances are "audio-wiped" (the 
mouth moves but no sound comes out), and breasts and buttocks in several scenes 
are pixilated (a process that blurs images). 
</P>
<P>
 Even the advisory that precedes the show takes liberties. Reminding viewers 
that the show "depicts a bygone era," the warning goes on: 'Discretion is 
advised for anyone who missed the 1970s." BART MILLS

TELEVISION; A LITTLE TO THE RIGHT THIS TIME; HENRY WINKLER HAS LONGTIME 
CREDENTIALS AS A HOLLYWOOD LIBERAL, BUT IN HIS NEW SERIES, "MONTY," HE PLAYS A 
LIMBAUGH-LIKE TALK-SHOW PUNDIT. WILL CONSERVATIVE VIEWS GET A FAIR SHAKE, OR IS 
MONTY TV'S NEXT LIBERAL GOAT? 
</P>

<P>
 Looking relieved to be playing his own age, someone he does not have to hold 
his stomach muscles tight for, Henry Winkler, 48, stands in a cold, cavernous, 
nearly empty sound stage in Hollywood at lunch break, doing a promotional 
interview for Fox Television's "Monty." That's the former Fonz's new comedy 
series, in which he plays a brash right-wing talk-show host who sees himself as 
"the conscience of America" and whose credo -- "I'm right. I'm right. I'm 
right. Shut up! " -- he'll turn into a book. Sort of a 
Rush-Limbaugh-in-waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 But Monty Richardson, whose platform is a small cable station on New York's 
Long Island in the middle of media nowhere, has no army of boosting 
"dittoheads." Instead, this "Archie Bunker of the '90s," as Winkler sees him, 
becomes a lightning rod for his equally outspoken family, whose views on 
hot-button political and social issues tend to be (gasp!) liberal. He gets as 
good as he gives. Even the set of his program, "Rightspeak," isn't exactly a 
safe house. Sure there's Clifford, the resident sycophant (Tom McGowan), who is 
a dead ringer for the real Limbaugh, but Monty's foil is Rita Simon (Joyce 
Guy), whom he exaggeratedly introduces as "my African American producer" when 
the color of her skin is quite obvious. She, in turn, easily retorts, "Thank 
you, 'white boy,' " drawing little quotes with her fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 The soft-spoken Winkler explains that Monty went to the station when his 
public-relations job in a defense plant was eliminated. "They gave him a talk 
show," says Winkler, executive producer of the series along with creator Marc 
Lawrence (screenwriter and co-producer of "Life With Mikey" and a writer of 
"Family Ties"). Suddenly, Winkler, a longstanding liberal Democrat who 
campaigned for President Clinton, is Monty. "Now there is no stopping him," he 
proclaims in the promo for the series, which debuts Tuesday at 8 p.m. "Donahue, 
watch out. Oprah is on her last legs. Monty is coming!" 
</P>
<P>
 There is a perverse, against-the-grain pattern to the roles Winkler has 
undertaken on series television. For 10 seasons -- 1974-84 -- he was the Fonz, 
creating a character who became an American pop cultural icon and making 
himself a fortune. So identified was he as Arthur (Fonzie) Fonzarelli on 
ABC-TV's "Happy Days" that you didn't realize how different Winkler was: Son of 
wealthy German Jewish refugee parents who thought he would make a fine 
diplomat, he was educated at private schools in Manhattan and Switzerland, then 
later graduated from Emerson College in Boston and got a master's degree from 
the Yale School of Drama. 
</P>
<P>
 The role may have submerged him to such a degree that he now says that for 
years he thought of himself as "younger brother," even with TV and movie 
executives his age. "I had to rip that little boy away and replace him," 
Winkler confides, grabbing a private moment in the makeup room, surrounded by 
mirrors. "I mean I was a dad now. I was a mature human being. I had to start 
thinking -- no, I had to start feeling -- in those terms." 
</P>
<P>
 So the actor, who had done the movies "Heroes" and "Night Shift," became an 
executive, co-producing "MacGyver," directing movies like "Cop and a Half" and 
starring in TV movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Winkler insists he has no regrets. The leather jacket wound up in the 
Smithsonian while the Fonz, he says, "changed my life." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a steppingstone, a foundation; I traveled everywhere because of him. 
He gave me tremendous pleasure. There are no downsides, no downsides." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, Winkler took on instant fatherhood with his marriage to Stacey 
Weitzman (who had a son, Jed, now a "Saturday Night Live" production assistant, 
from her first marriage, to criminal attorney Howard L. Weitzman). The Winklers 
-- she is a commissioner with the Los Angeles County Department of Children's 
Services -- have since had two children of their own, Zoe, 13, and Max, 10. 
</P>
<P>
 At President Clinton's inauguration, Winkler learned just how potent Fonzie, 
still seen on Nickelodeon and in 126 countries, is. As the actor related 
recently on "The Tonight Show," someone tapped him on the shoulder, asking for 
his autograph. "I said, 'Well, sir, I don't usually do that.' And I turned 
around and I said, 'But for you it would be an honor.' " It was former hostage 
Terry Anderson, who told him: "You and your show kept us going." 
</P>
<P>
 So why would Winkler choose "Monty" as his series comeback? In his production 
office on the Warner Bros. Hollywood lot, gazing at a framed photo of himself 
and Hillary Rodham Clinton, he answers matter-of-factly: "I need to play a 
larger-than-life character. The Fonz is a large character, but that's who I am. 
I can't just play the dad." 
</P>
<P>
 The character -- perhaps even Winkler himself -- is a nice intersect with 
Limbaugh, whose combination of self-confidence and talent created his own 
larger-than-life talk-show persona. Limbaugh, however, is saying little about 
"Monty." 
</P>
<P>
 A Limbaugh radio producer said last month that he himself was aware of "a 
possible sitcom" involving a conservative host and went to query his boss. "I 
asked Rush, and he looked at me funny -- said, 'There is (such a show)?' I 
think he'd have to see it in context. . . . You can (just) say we have no 
comment." 
</P>
<P>
 "Monty's" producers acknowledge Limbaugh as the inspiration for the character, 
but Monty is not, they insist, meant to be a carbon copy of Rush. Monty also 
contains elements of such confrontational hosts as Joe Pyne, Wally George and 
Morton Downey Jr.; he's being billed as "stuck somewhere" between '50s 
McCarthyism and the right-wing hosts of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Is Winkler presenting a legitimate portrayal of Monty? Or is he mocking him? 
"I don't know that legitimizing or mocking are the right words," the actor 
says. "I am breathing life into a guy who is outrageous. Do I like Monty? There 
are times I would like to sock him in the mouth. . . . Other times I find him 
to be very dear." 
</P>
<P>
 Winkler's ambivalence reflects the real issue that the makers of "Monty" are 
grappling with. As the 12 episodes Fox has ordered unfold, the question is 
whether the sitcom will be seen as just another Hollywood Revenge of the 
Liberals, or whether conservatives will quietly cheer Monty on, the way some 
did Archie on "All in the Family." Yet again, the series might simply be viewed 
as offering another take on family values. 
</P>
<P>
 Monty's family -- which brings out the best, or worst, in him, depending on 
your view -- consists of wife Fran, who teaches second grade (Kate Burton -- 
Richard and Sybil Burton's daughter); son Greg (David Schwimmer), a Yale 
graduate dropping plans for Yale Law to become a chef; 14-year-old son David 
(David Krumholtz), who sees himself as a loser, particularly with girls, and 
Geena (China Kantner -- Grace Slick and Paul Kantner's daughter) as the 
performance artist-writer-hairdresser whom Greg brings home from Europe, a 
vegetarian with a ring in her nose. 
</P>
<P>
 For the pair of liberal Democratic producers -- Winkler and Lawrence -- there 
is an almost built-in tension on "Monty" between promoting the viewpoint of the 
lead character and intrinsically wanting to denigrate it. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Winkler declined playing Monty until he warmed to the character's 
flamboyance. "He's going to outrage everybody," Winkler says with delight. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence, 34, who grew up in Plainview, Long Island (where "Monty" is set), 
and readily describes his politics as "New York, liberal -- the last Republican 
I liked was Lincoln," worried as well: 
</P>
<P>
 "Friends of mine, other writers, say to me, 'Gee, if ("Monty") is successful, 
it winds up promoting a dangerous viewpoint.' I'd be lying if I said I have an 
unbelievably well-constructed argument against that. Except he almost winds up 
getting beaten down in every show, sort of exposed. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence amends: "I like to see him humbled and leveled. What we don't want -- 
you can't have Monty state a conservative viewpoint and then, because we're 
mostly liberals writing this show, have him knocked down and say, 'You're 
wrong.' Because I can't judge that. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to give fair credence to what we perceive (conservative) views to be, 
as long as we have viewpoints and mouthpieces for the opposite point of view in 
terms of Rita and Fran at home and certainly Geena. If we're going to do this 
character, we have to commit to him . . . saying things that we find 
objectionable." 
</P>
<P>
 There is also the actor factor. It's the performer who gives texture to a 
character. Lawrence likens Winkler's portrayal of Monty to Michael J. Fox's 
depiction of young Reaganite Alex Keaton on "Family Ties": "Clearly Henry is 
playing this part that allows the warmth to come through -- the other side, the 
likable part about Monty." 
</P>
<P>
 At Fox, they see "Monty" striking a "balance" between conservative and liberal 
viewpoints, as Dan McDermott, senior vice president of current programming, 
suggests. According to Lawrence, Fox owner Rupert Murdoch, a political 
conservative, said he "loved the fact that the show is political, that Monty 
was a guy who could pronounce views to the world and then come home and get 
kicked in the teeth about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Monty's "Rightspeak" monologues -- cameo centerpieces for each show -- could, 
in isolation, cause conservative hearts to purr. 
</P>
<P>
 On Clinton: "First he says, 'I'm not going to raise taxes.' Then he does. Then 
he says, 'I'm going to send troops to Bosnia,' but he doesn't. Then he says 
he's going to create more jobs for the country -- unfortunately that country is 
Mexico. Can you imagine if this guy did inhale?" 
</P>
<P>
 On a grade school book about lesbian parenting -- a takeoff on "Heather Has 
Two Mommies," which here is called "Mary Has Two Mommies": "What's going on 
with the teachers in this country? What are they going to be teaching next . . 
. 'Mary Has Three Mommies and a Little Lamb Who Lives With Another Little 
Lamb'?" 
</P>
<P>
 On teen-age sex: "Abstinence." 
</P>
<P>
 The "Two Mommies" idea came from Robert Shrum, a top Democratic political ad 
maker whose clients have included Ted Kennedy, George McGovern and Dick 
Gephardt. Shrum, a close friend of Winkler's who recently sat in for a week of 
production, going from table reading to taping, has also suggested a monologue 
on health care -- "The government can't deliver the mail. Now they're going to 
deliver babies?" 
</P>
<P>
 Yet conservatives who laugh at an excerpt or two nevertheless promise to 
monitor "Monty." L. Brent Bozell III, chairman of Media Research Center, a 
watchdog group, says he is "as skeptical of Henry Winkler knowing what 
conservatives would think as Winkler would be of Brent Bozell writing a script 
for liberals." He adds that he doesn't "trust" Winkler. Bozell claims that a 
1991 CBS-TV docudrama in which Winkler starred, "Absolute Strangers," about 
Martin Klein, a Long Island accountant who battled antiabortion activists and 
went to court to save the life of his comatose wife by aborting her pregnancy, 
was inaccurate. (CBS and Winkler dispute that.) 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Crawford, editor of TV Etc., the center's monthly newsletter, which 
attacks what it considers liberal bias in Hollywood, notes that the monologues 
notwithstanding, what's crucial is "who has the last word." 
</P>
<P>
 The core of "Monty" is not tennis-match debate, but life and politics 
colliding. In the pilot episode, Monty can't stand Geena, but when Greg packs 
his suitcase after Monty puts his foot down against her, he relents and allows 
them to stay under his roof. "He loves his family," Winkler notes. "And no 
matter how disrespectful he is sometimes, he thanks his lucky stars Fran is in 
his life." 
</P>
<P>
 In another episode, Monty discovers that 14-year-old David has been given a 
condom -- not for immediate use but because all his friends have them. Monty 
goes against his better judgment and takes David to a drugstore to show him how 
to buy more, for the future. Problem is, he runs into a female viewer, who's 
shocked. 
</P>
<P>
 In still another episode, Monty discovers that Fran is being sexually harassed 
by her principal. Though he basically believes his wife, he faces an awkward 
moment when he confronts the principal, who says anyone can "misinterpret" a 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey . . . I'm the guy who devoted a whole month of shows to Clarence Thomas 
vs. Anita (Make-a-Mountain-Out-of-a-Mole) Hill," Monty says, "but we're not 
talking about Anita Hill. We're talking about my wife here." 
</P>
<P>
 Probably the harshest treatment of Monty comes in an episode titled "Wild Wild 
Willy and His O.K. Corral," in which he gets caught up in his ambition for a 
better time slot and "outs" the gay host of a children's show, forcing the man 
off the air. Monty's family is furious. 
</P>
<P>
 This episode, Lawrence explains, will soon undergo rewriting -- and some 
retaping -- so that Monty will come upon letters from children who loved the 
host and will feel some guilt for what he has done.  
</P>
<P>
 Though he does use pejoratives for gay men, Monty appears to eschew Archie 
Bunker's racial slurs. In a dispute with an Italian American neighbor over the 
neighbor's cats ripping up Monty's lawn, he originally referred to the neighbor 
by a name based on a popular Italian cheese. The producers later removed the 
language. Lawrence maintains that making him overtly racist would "make me sick 
to my stomach." While he notes that Bunker and Monty might be "distant cousins" 
in their attitudes, Monty "would say them differently. . . . I don't think 
Monty's racist -- his political philosophy is actually libertarian." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there are times when Monty is a hero. In one episode, Geena's father, 
a former '60s folk singer, now owner of a string of fast-food health 
restaurants, wants to cut Monty in on a lucrative deal. But Monty withdraws 
when he realizes the father is and has been abusive to Geena. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a moment in that show," Winkler explains, "when I come in and the 
man has his hand up to hit her and I say, 'I wouldn't do that if I were you.' 
And I walk up to her and say, 'Are you OK? . . . Shall I take you 
ho-ho-hom-home ?' " -- his voice growing more tremulous. "Like, 'God almighty, 
I've got to do this, but I dread it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That love of family, Winkler suggests, makes him "relate to" Monty, "even if I 
don't share his political views." 
</P>
<P>
 It was while filming "Absolute Strangers" that Winkler realized how much he 
missed acting. He was going to develop a series with Gary Goldberg, his 
longtime neighbor on the Paramount lot, but "Gary came to me and said, 'I'm 
just burned out.' I said, 'I understand. We're good friends, we'll work again.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 So Winkler went on the hunt. "I had a lot of French toast, a lot of breakfast 
meetings." 
</P>
<P>
 Along came Lawrence, who got the idea for "Monty" after tuning into Limbaugh's 
TV show. "I said, 'Oh, please, Marc, come on. This is so controversial. I want 
to be on the air for seven years.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But as Winkler tells it, it took only two more meetings to persuade him. 
Lawrence had a contract with Disney, which sold NBC on making a pilot. In the 
original version, giving the story added edge, Monty had a gay daughter who 
brought home her gay friend. The pilot never aired, and NBC passed on going to 
series. Winkler and Lawrence say it was because of the gay daughter. NBC 
spokeswoman Dawn Dubovsky said the decision was made "for creative reasons that 
had nothing to do with the gay daughter." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney took "Monty" to Fox. Winkler says Fox asked them to "rethink the 
concept because the gay daughter, in the beginning anyway, might be too 
controversial." He and Lawrence agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Winkler has a lot riding on this series. He has a tough time slot, with 
competition from ABC's "Full House" and CBS' "Rescue 911." Winkler knows it. 
But he says he doesn't stay awake nights worrying over things he "cannot 
control." Shrum likens his mood to that of a candidate gearing up for a 
campaign. And Fox knows the pitfalls of Tuesdays at 8 p.m. McDermott says the 
network wanted "a noisy show that's star-driven (with) a loud, provocative 
concept to be able to cut through all the clutter and immediately distinguish 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
 "Monty" should get noisier. Winkler and Lawrence, having conceded the gay 
daughter, now intend to give him a gay sister.*

THE LANDLADY WITH A CAREFULLY GUARDED SECRET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shhhh! Don't tell the secret! As in "The Crying Game," there's a secret at the 
center of "Tales of the City," and Olympia Dukakis is guarding it carefully. As 
Anna Madrigal, the wise and tolerant landlady of the San Francisco 
boardinghouse where most of the characters live, Dukakis constantly wears an 
air of mystery and a Mona Lisa smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone in the story has a secret that finally emerges," says Dukakis, who 
is wrapped in a long, flowing garment that on closer examination turns out to 
be more like harem pants than a dress. "Because of the secrets, the story has a 
continual air of suspense. It's like a Brueghel painting. It's like life -- 
funny, stupid, sad, horrific all at once." 
</P>
<P>
 Dukakis, 62, has cornered the market in worldly wise middle-aged women since 
winning an Oscar for "Moonstruck" in 1987 and starring in "Steel Magnolias" in 
1989. She gets to say a line in "Tales of the City" that many women of a 
certain age feel has long needed saying. When her lover compliments Anna on 
being so good-looking despite her age, she says, "But this is how a woman my 
age is supposed to look!" 
</P>
<P>
 Presiding benignly over her recherche building, gardening in her best finery 
and laughing over joints after dinner, "Anna Madrigal is like an angel," 
Dukakis says. "She's someone hanging around watching, someone who's there to 
provide comfort, so people don't feel alone. One of her tenants asks if she 
objects to pets and she says, 'I don't object to anything.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Anna has an understanding and a tolerance that are born of real struggle. She 
grew up an outsider, thinking there was no one in the world like her. Everyone 
feels that to a degree. She survived those feelings of shame and guilt. She's 
survived herself." 
</P>
<P>
 As many actors do, Dukakis feels she was destined to play this part, but she 
has a particular reason: "In the last of Armistead Maupin's books about Anna 
Madrigal and her friends, which came out in 1988, she visits the Greek island 
of Lesbos, which is the ancestral home of the Dukakises. Was I meant to play 
this part or what?" 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the British, Dukakis gets her chance. The material was rejected by 
Hollywood because of "fear of the sexual canvas," in her view. "Relationships 
don't travel like action. The Americans weren't interested because they didn't 
think they could make money off it. The British think they can." 
</P>
<P>
 Can a depiction of gays and straights interacting happily together fly in 
American living rooms? " 'Tales of the City' can raise awareness," Dukakis 
says. "It can't change attitudes. Attitudes change millimeter by millimeter. If 
movies could change attitudes, the first war movie would have stopped war. This 
story can perhaps increase understanding and tolerance a little." BART MILLS

COVER STORY; THE LAST STAND FOR STAND-UP?; DOZENS OF THE NATION'S COMEDY CLUBS 
HAVE GONE OUT OF BUSINESS, BUT MOST L.A. ESTABLISHMENTS -- WHERE PEOPLE LIKE 
JAY LENO AND JERRY SEINFELD ROUTINELY DROP IN TO HONE THEIR ROUTINES -- ARE 
RIDING OUT THE STORM

<P>
 The extent of the comedy club slump became clear last year when New York's 
landmark Catch a Rising Star club closed its doors. There was a time when Catch 
and the New York Improv were the twin citadels of happening, urban comedy, with 
Rodney Dangerfield and Robert Klein yukking it up at the Improv and David 
Brenner and Richard Belzer working the laughs at Catch. Jerry Seinfeld got his 
start at Catch, and made a point of being there on an emotional closing night. 
</P>
<P>
 The N.Y. Improv is hanging on, but former Catch owner Richard Fields sees more 
club closings in comedy's future. "My advice to people in the comedy business 
is 'Sell,' " he says. 
</P>
<P>
 The slump hasn't been limited to big-city nightlife. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a club called the Holiday House in Monroeville, Pa.," David Brenner 
recalls. "It sat about 1,200, and at one time I would do 10 or 11 nights, two 
shows a night, and sell it out three weeks before I got to town. Then the club 
cut down to a six-day week, then just weekends. They went to Friday and 
Saturday shows only, then just Saturday, then out of business. Now it's a 
mall." 
</P>
<P>
 These are hard times in the laughter trade. During the last few years, dozens 
of comedy clubs around the country have gone out of business. Journeymen comics 
whose careers blossomed in the '80s are now finding that lucrative gigs are 
difficult to come by. And potential comedy club audiences seem to be staying 
home, cash-poor and possibly overwhelmed by the amount of stand-up shtick 
flowing freely from the television. 
</P>
<P>
 Can it be that we are witnessing the death of our civilization's smoky dens of 
reflected truths and two-drink minimums? Is the end of the comedy club at hand? 
</P>
<P>
 Not in Los Angeles, where, despite some setbacks, comedy clubs are quietly 
riding out the rough times. L.A. club owners and comics possess a lonely 
optimism about the business. Around the rest of the country, stand-up comedy 
may not be the golden fad it was a few years ago, but here, comedy is still 
spoken of as an art form. With apologies to Mr. Dangerfield, this may be the 
last town where comedy gets respect. 
</P>
<P>
 "The numbers are down dramatically from three or four years ago, but in L.A. 
there are still probably 100,000 people a month going to see comedy," says Bob 
Fisher, the owner of Pasadena's Ice House. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing that sets Los Angeles apart as a comedy town is the sheer number and 
quality of the comedians who call L.A. home. Clubgoers throughout the rest of 
the country rely on comedians' road schedules to bring the best laughs to town, 
while here, top talent can be seen in the local clubs almost every night of the 
week. Top comics use the clubs as a place where new material can be written on 
the spot or polished. Newer comics are hoping to be seen. Many of the comics 
who have recently made the enviable jump to a starring role in a sitcom were 
often first spotted by the networks while doing their act in local clubs, and 
they often return to the clubs to keep a fresh edge to the clubs to keep a 
fresh edge on their comic talents. 
</P>
<P>
 "First-rate comedians are in town on a daily basis," says Jan Smith of Igby's, 
a club that has been in West Los Angeles for 11 years. "They're doing film and 
television work as well as comedy. As an L.A. club owner, I get top comedians 
fairly inexpensively, because they use the clubs as a showcase." 
</P>
<P>
 Says "Tonight Show" host Jay Leno, who still tries out new material in local 
comedy clubs: "That's really what makes the Los Angeles clubs different from 
anywhere in the country. You're not going to get Jerry Seinfeld just dropping 
in to some club in Baltimore, but it happens out here. That keeps the standard 
of comedy high in this town, and it makes it exciting for the people who are 
paying to be in the clubs." 
</P>
<P>
 But there's the problem: Fewer people are paying to be in the clubs these 
days. Big names and quality jokes don't do a nightclub much good if the room is 
empty. Even L.A. clubs have experienced a downturn -- the Santa Monica Improv, 
an annex of Budd Friedman's original Improv on Melrose Avenue, is closed at 
present. The 6-year-old club's future is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 The public's entertainment dollars are tight, and the comedy business is 
unquestionably going through heavy changes.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Wall Street Journal would say we're going through a 'correction,' " says 
Richard Jeni, who was named best stand-up comic at the 1993 American Comedy 
Awards. "The comedy club experience has been devalued, and there are so many 
comics around today that you need to be a lot funnier than you needed to be 20 
years ago in order to get attention." 
</P>
<P>
 There are still more comedy clubs around now than there were 20 years ago, but 
figures are way down from just a few years back. From a national comedy club 
population of 20 back in 1979, their number grew to more than 400 just 10 years 
later. Since then, close to a hundred clubs have closed, and comedy trade 
papers have reported that business is down 10% to 40% since hitting its 
profitable peak in 1990. Some struggling clubs are doing away with comedy 
altogether and simply staying open as bars, while others have begun to book 
less comedy and more music. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jeni points out that his career, now in its 12th year, is proof that a 
funny performer can find his audience no matter the prevailing economic 
climate: "There's been a recession for comedy and for the country, but these 
have been my best years. I'm getting more people to spend $15 to see me in a 
club now than I did when the business was booming." 
</P>
<P>
 The comedy boom took shape in the early to mid-'80s. As the disco era came to 
a close, it was a night out at a comedy club that became the entertainment of 
choice for a wider spectrum of people. The excitement generated by live, 
quality comedy fueled a blazing club business, and soon owners of steakhouses, 
bowling alleys and music clubs were revamping their venues to make room for 
comedians.  
</P>
<P>
 An unprecedented wave of would-be entertainers left their day jobs and jumped 
into a comic's life on the road. Enjoying a willing supply of talent, and a 
voracious audience demand, club owners could do no wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "All you had to do was open up the reservation line and fasten your seat 
belt," says Fisher, of the Ice House. Though that club has had a long history 
as a cabaret and variety nightclub, it's been a comedy club since Fisher 
purchased it in 1978. "During the boom, this was a fantastic business, and 
everyone profited. But I knew it wouldn't last. I kept thinking about the years 
when there were 800 folk music clubs around the country doing gangbusters 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, as the country's economy slipped into recession, the disposable 
dollars that had powered the comedy boom seemed to evaporate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Comedy clubs became like pawn shops, pizzerias and liquor marts -- there was 
one on every block. After a while, only the best clubs could survive. How much 
can people laugh, anyway?" Brenner asks. 
</P>
<P>
 While the clubs were beginning to feel the pinch, television was discovering 
that stand-up acts provided a steady stream of inexpensively produced, original 
programming. These days, any home equipped with cable is still treated to a 
wide range of shows in which comics of varying talent perform quick, five- to 
10-minute bits of stand-up. And over the last couple of years, it has become 
increasingly likely that the strongest, most popular comics will end up as the 
lead characters in sitcoms rather than as the top dog in a lineup of stand-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 It's debatable whether current stand-up programs help to pique audience 
interest in particular performers, whether they engender excitement for comedy 
in general, or whether they have simply stumbled into comic overkill. But it's 
clear that for many potential clubgoers, a night of live comedy in the clubs 
has lost its special appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Television has put on too many comedians who weren't ready for television," 
says club owner Jamie Masada, whose Laugh Factory has been a part of the Sunset 
Strip for 15 years. "But I don't think we can blame all of comedy's problems on 
television. They said nobody would go to the movies when television first came 
out, but movies accepted the challenge, and going to the movie theater remained 
a special experience. It's up to club owners to accept the challenge to improve 
their business." 
</P>
<P>
 "Going to see comedy is still a live theater event," says Laurie Zaks, vice 
president for talent, development and special programs at the New York-based 
Comedy Central cable channel. "People still love a fun night out, and on our 
shows you just get a taste of what live comedy is like." 
</P>
<P>
 Zaks also points out that if club comedy is to enjoy a strong resurgence, it 
will be television that lays the groundwork, as it did during the '80s. "In the 
past three months, when I'm walking around New York with my gym stuff in a 
Comedy Central bag, people are stopping me and telling me who their favorite 
comics are. And comedians that have only appeared on the channel a few times 
are telling us that they are already getting stopped in airports by fans who 
recognize them. I think interest in comedy is already heating up again." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps some club owners, as well as comics and clubgoers, have forgotten that 
the club experience is not supposed to be the perfectly polished entertainment 
that television often presents. The clubs around L.A. have a long history of 
providing workshop environments for up-and-coming comics as well as proven vets 
developing new material. The comic rhythm in a club during a night of showcases 
isn't as smooth as what's delivered on the stand-up shows, but those nights are 
crucial to the health of a comedy scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "The clubs should be viewed as schools," says Charles Joffe, an elder 
statesman in the comedy world. Along with partner Jack Rollins, Joffe has 
managed the careers of some of the biggest names in the comedy biz, including 
Woody Allen, Robert Klein, Billy Crystal, Robin Williams and David Letterman. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what they started out as and that's what they should be. I get very 
angry with comics who do their act night after night without experimenting with 
the material or playing to the crowd. And I've fought for years with club 
owners who just want to book headliners who deliver a set act. The comedy clubs 
need to be learning grounds, where comics have time to find their own message 
and their own style. Too many comics are in a rush to get on television." 
</P>
<P>
 Budd Friedman of the Improv has certainly not shied away from using television 
to promote his club, and has had success with his widely seen "Evening at the 
Improv" series. But he insists that there's a quality to live comedy that can't 
be duplicated on the small screen. "There are guys I see on TV who will just 
make me smile, and then when I see them in the club doing the same joke, 
suddenly I'm laughing out loud." 
</P>
<P>
 Joffe says that television has been both helpful and harmful to recently begun 
comedy careers. "The insatiable thirst of TV got the boom started and gave 
people exposure. But there was a time when you could do Ed Sullivan or Johnny 
Carson once and become a national star. People stopped what they were doing 
when they saw a comedian on TV. Now, you can do Letterman, Leno, Arsenio and 
everybody else half a dozen times each and people still don't remember your 
name. It takes rare talent to get serious attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Amid all the television competition, Leno still feels that it's important for 
"The Tonight Show" to offer a launching pad for young comics' careers. But he 
also believes that comics have to be careful about how much they use the many 
television spots that are available. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't take credit for it, but I know that an appearance on 'The Tonight 
Show' still carries a lot of weight out there, and I've seen a lot of our 
comics go on to better things. I just think the comics have to be careful about 
overexposing themselves with all the TV that's out there. If you've seen 
somebody doing their 20 minutes on cable over and over again, why should you 
pay to go to a club and see the same 20 minutes? And now you're even seeing 
clips of comics in 1978, in bell-bottoms and long hair, doing the same jokes 
they're doing tonight in a club somewhere. That can't be good for a comic's 
career." 
</P>
<P>
 Even during his pre-host days in the middle of the '80s boom, Leno was careful 
about not allowing too much of his own stand-up routines to end up on 
television shows. "I always thought it was important to treat a live 
performance as live and TV as TV. I've always been willing to go to where the 
people who want to see me are, even if that means a little less money than 
doing a TV spot." 
</P>
<P>
 Leno continues to work on the local club scene, making an appearance as 
recently as last week at the Comedy and Magic Club in Hermosa Beach. He can 
work the local clubs at his convenience, but many other high-profile pros have 
seen their work schedules lightened by the national downturn in club business. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the loss of Catch a Rising Star in New York, there is still a strong 
comedy scene in New York. Caroline's has emerged as a premier headlining club, 
and newer talents showcase at clubs such as Stand Up NY and the Comic Strip. 
The original Improv relocated this summer, and is currently opened Thursdays 
through Saturdays. "The clubs always seem to be packed when I'm in them," says 
Zaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Between New York and L.A., however, there are big changes in the comedy 
landscape. While owners have been quick to close faltering clubs over the last 
several years, comics who got a taste of success in the '80s aren't so quick to 
throw away their punch lines. Brenner believes that a current glut of comics 
makes it more difficult for any single comic to stand out. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I started out there were a couple hundred people making a living as 
comedians. Now I hear there's something like 8,000. I like to think that cream 
rises to the top, but that doesn't matter much if you're in an ocean of milk." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Altman, another well-traveled comic vet, agrees with Brenner's 
assessment. "Comedy is no longer as exclusive or as rewarding. Genius still 
shines through, but it's harder to distinguish yourself. This used to be a 
strange, specialized profession but now there are juniors in college studying 
to be comics. You tell somebody on a plane you're a comic and they say, 'Oh, 
really?' while stifling a yawn. They used to look at you like you were a circus 
freak. I knew we were in trouble when they started having comedy nights at the 
motels around interstate junctions." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeni isn't convinced that the ballooning ranks of comics have had a negative 
effect on the quality of the laughs, however. "The standard line is that there 
used to be 100 comics and 10 were great; now there are 10,000 and 10 are great. 
That's just not logical," says Jeni. "You'd be postulating the only situation 
in history where competition didn't improve the product. There are more 
comedians than ever before, so it follows that there are more bad, more 
mediocre and more great comedians than ever before." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, these new comedians need stages to shtick on. While the present 
national scene may be a bleak vista of diminishing returns, in Los Angeles 
there is tempered optimism. Comics and owners who have survived the shakeout of 
the last few years remain fiercely dedicated to the club scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's feast or famine these days," says Jan Smith of Igby's. "You can only 
count on a full house when you've got a top headliner. But for me it's a 
no-lose situation because I enjoy the comics and the crowds so much." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitzi Shore, owner of the 21-year-old Comedy Store, feels that hard times only 
make the remaining clubs and comics stronger. "A lot of used car salesman went 
into comedy when it took off in the early '80s. Now there's a weeding out, and 
I think it's great. Eventually the audiences will realize that the stand-up TV 
shows don't give them pleasure, and we'll be ready to give them fresh, quality 
stand-up." 
</P>
<P>
 Roseanne Arnold, Jerry Seinfeld and Tim Allen have made spectacularly 
successful jumps from the comedy clubs to sitcoms, and an army of comics are 
now following their lead. For the last few seasons, TV producers have been 
using comedy clubs as a crucial scouting ground for new talent.  
</P>
<P>
 The edgy charms of Brett Butler were discovered in that fashion, and she's 
currently starring in ABC's "Grace Under Fire." She's thrilled to be in a 
series but is finding that she also enjoys stand-up work more than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I love going into the clubs, because since I've been on television, I 
have license to kill. Before the show, I liked being an anonymous struggling 
artist who could make a room laugh. Now I'm not anonymous or struggling, but I 
still love my comedy and I don't want to play it safe. After 12 years, I'm 
finally beginning to understand what the art is about. Comedy is still like 
table-dancing with a microphone in some places, but there will always be a few 
club owners who cherish what's unique about comedy." 
</P>
<P>
 John Caponera has just finished 13 episodes of his first series, "The Good 
Life," which premiered last week on NBC. But, like Butler, he's not forsaking 
clubs -- he says he needs the intimate setting to keep his comedy fresh.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's where my material comes together. I like to do my writing on stage. 
There's something special about working spontaneously and doing it from the 
heart without worrying who's watching. The club is where I get to show my true 
colors." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing the amount of calls we get from fairly important people trying 
to track down comics they've seen on our shows," says Comedy Central's Zaks. 
"There's a real rush to be the first one to offer a development deal to a hot 
new comic." Zaks says that Comedy Central has fielded enough interest in talent 
that the channel has opened an in-house booking business. 
</P>
<P>
 Most comics still working steadily in L.A. clubs admit that they'd like a shot 
at TV work, but they don't downplay the satisfaction of live work. For some, 
the effect of a good set in the clubs can verge on the medicinal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's extraordinary," says comic-performer Charles Fleischer, perhaps best 
known as the voice of Roger Rabbit. "I've had times when I go on stage with a 
terrible headache, and I feel completely healed afterward. Laughter is a very 
powerful force, for the laughers and for the person at the center of the 
laughstorm." 
</P>
<P>
 Stand-up Wendy Liebman still cherishes her live work, but is making plans 
against an unsure club future. "I feel I'm at my most creative in the clubs. 
But the business is evolving and forcing me to re-evaluate my career. I may end 
up developing a one-woman show just to keep working." 
</P>
<P>
 One-person shows offer an alternative to club work for some performers at a 
time that club owners are also looking for alternative forms of entertainment 
to recapture the club audience. Budd Friedman had some success staging the 
comic play "Shear Madness" at his Santa Monica Improv -- but not enough to keep 
the club's doors open. Bob Fisher is considering bringing revue-style nights to 
the Ice House, in which comedy would be mixed with music and variety acts. 
</P>
<P>
 While the owners wait out the dip in business, the next comedy boom may be 
taking shape. 
</P>
<P>
 "Comedy doesn't go out of style, it just changes shape," says Joffe. "I have 
no fears that the history of the comedy club is coming to an end. There are 
still comics who take their work very seriously, and club owners who love 
comedy as an art. If comedy seems to be dying, it's only in number and not in 
quality." 
</P>
<P>
 Joffe says that comedy will do just fine until then. "People are nervous about 
the demise of the comedy club, but they were just as nervous years ago when the 
comedy radio shows were fading out, or when the Catskills resorts began to 
close. I feel badly that some of the older clubs are gone, but there will 
always be new comedians, and there will always be a market for them. If the 
field gets narrowed down, that's OK. We've just gone through a period where 
there were far too many comics, and far too many who weren't very good." 
</P>
<P>
 "The business is going through huge changes, and we probably won't see 
anything like the '80s again," says Fields of the now-defunct Catch a Rising 
Star. "But these things are cyclical. In five years we may be talking about the 
Great '90s Comedy Revival." 
</P>
<P>
 Respected veteran comic Alan King has achieved wide and varied success in 
films and television, but he remains devoted to the work of young club 
comedians. He says that a comic era may be coming to a close, but that the 
future will certainly have its share of laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a question of optimism or pessimism. Comedy will always be here, and 
great comics will come out of the woodwork when you least expect it. Last year 
I sat and watched 139 comedians do five minutes each at an open call for the 
Toyota Comedy Festival. Most of these kids had the guts of lions, and they're 
learning their craft. They'll be the ones to bring new life to the clubs."

THE LEGEND OF FLYING BOY

<TEXT>
<P>
 This only happened once, but once is enough -- so listen carefully. There was 
a boy who had nothing to do. No toys, no nothing. Plus, it was hot in the empty 
room. Well, the room was full of sleeping parents and an empty cot. The boy was 
bored. He needed something to do. A hairpin on the floor needed picking up. It 
too, needed something to do -- like the wire, the socket over there on the 
wall. You know the rest of the story -- but not the best of the story: the feel 
of power, the empowering act of being the air! You had to be there. Including 
the activity that followed. Flying Boy -- where are you? Flying Boy -- you 
flew!

 TREK MEMORIES by William Shatner with Chris Kreski (Harper Collins: $22; 306 
pp). The "Star Trek" universe has certainly taken to heart the Vulcan saying 
"Live long and prosper."So it was only a matter of time that William Shatner as 
the peripatetic character of Captain Kirk would finally give us his story of 
where no man has gone before, an insider's look at the development and the 
day-to-day ups and downs of doing the original "Star Trek" TV show. This is not 
an autobiography, there is little of his personal life here, except in how it 
affected his work. Written in a cheery manner and surprisingly low key on the 
ego-scale, Shatner keeps an even keel as he recites anecdotes, fights, how the 
characters developed, script problems, struggles between the network and 
producers, as well as the inevitable personality conflicts at work in a large, 
close-knit cast. Shatner even touches on the fact that not all of his 
cast-mates found him Mr. Congeniality to work with and Shatner himself tells of 
his "strained association" with the paterfamilias of the whole enterprise, Gene 
Roddenberry. Sue Martin

 ON LOVE by Alain de Botton (Atlantic Monthly Press: $17; 231 pp.) "Familiarity 
(of lovers) creates a new language, an in-house language of intimacy that . . . 
cannot readily be understood by others."This is one of the many ideas in "On 
Love," Alain de Botton's concept-oriented novel that tells the story of one 
couple's relationship as if it were under a microscope. As they fall in love, 
every thought, word and gesture of the two characters is carefully labeled like 
a scientific specimen. There's even diagrams. When emotional distance and 
manipulation creeps into their blissful relationship that is labeled also. "And 
so at this point, desperate to woo the partner back at any cost, the lover 
turns to romantic terrorism . . . (sulking, jealousy, guilt) that attempts to 
force the partner to return love by blowing up . . . in front of the loved one. 
. . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The ins and outs of passion, as described by Alain de Botton in painstaking 
detail, is almost completely universal. Anyone who's ever been in a 
relationship, or even watched one on TV, will recognize the "Subtext of 
Seduction," "The In-House Language," and "Romantic Terrorism." This immediate 
recognition is the novel's blessing and curse. It's a lot of fun to be 
validated again and again, to be humorously reminded that all the pain you've 
been through is very much the same as other people's pain. But in the end 
recognition alone won't carry a whole book. "On Love" is a one-trick novel, a 
neat, scientific equation that explains things already discovered long ago.

 BUTTERFLY STORIES by William T. Vollmann ; (Grove/Atlantic: $22; 200 pp.) 
Reading William Vollmann's new novel is a little like going on one of those 
amusement park rides where you scream, clutch your loved one and swear never to 
do it again, but then as soon as the ride is over you jump on line to buy 
another ticket.The unnamed main character (called at various times, the 
butterfly boy, the journalist, the husband) travels with a friend, the 
photographer, to Thailand and Cambodia where, in an almost religious fervor, 
they have obsessive, unprotected sex with many, many prostitutes. The 
photographer seems purely decadent, but the journalist, who falls in love with 
Vanna, a Cambodian prostitute, is clearly looking for something. To say what 
that is -- love, consciousness, identity -- unfairly shrinks this sad and 
subtle novel. The journalist becomes a " . . . crazed and greedy butterfly . . 
. The girls give him colds, coughs, sore throats, weird new aches. . . . What 
he was doing was systematically dismantling his own reality, blurring faces and 
names. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Vollmann's writing has its own bright, lethal rhythm like a cut that pulses 
blood with every heartbeat. Instead of being gratuitous, the graphic sex and 
violence are completely organic to the story, which turns liquid and 
contradicts itself on a moment's notice. Although it has great rewards, 
"Butterfly Stories" is a scary and difficult book.

 NEW STORIES FROM THE SOUTH: The Year's Best, 1993 edited by Shannon Ravenel. 
(Algonquin: $10.95; 376 pp.) It's interesting to note that a good bit of the 
work in "New Stories From the South" isn't particularly Southern.Editor Shannon 
Ravenel explains this by saying, "Since great characters are what counts in 
this series, if I have to stretch conventional boundaries to include them, I 
will." It's also interesting to note that the non-Southern stories are among 
the best in this uneven collection. "Evening," by Richard Bausch is a stunning 
portrait of an older man trying desperately to navigate his relationships with 
loved ones while caught in a terrible depression. In another wonderful story 
dealing with age, "Marie," by Edward Jones, the subject is not so much 
depression as identity. Marie, an old African-American woman, is forced through 
a series of unusual incidents to put her voice out into the world, and then 
listen in surprise to what that voice says. Neither piece feels at all 
Southern. 
</P>
<P>
 Strangely enough, the only problem with this anthology has nothing to do with 
regional concerns or even the stories themselves -- although a few are real 
clunkers. The problem is in the author quotes at the end of each piece. It 
seems the writers were asked about their stories and many responded by 
explaining, in some detail, exactly what inspired that particular piece of 
work. For many of us, one of the joys of fiction is its magical ability to make 
you completely believe in a different world, a process that's severely 
undermined when the writers' secret machinery is all over the final page. It's 
kind of like finding out that your best friend, the person you trust 
implicitly, is really a robot.

 CALIFORNIA TIME by Catherine Hiller. (St. Martin's Press: $19.95; 263 pp.) The 
difference between New York and Los Angeles has been the subject of countless 
party conversations, magazine articles and comedy bits.It's also the main 
concern of "California Time," a well-intentioned but ultimately problematic 
novel about one family's bi-coastal experience. Mom, dad, son and daughter 
relocate across country to escape the dirt and crime in New York. But instead 
of finding their California dream they come face to face with the emotional 
shifts a move can bring -- shifts that change both individual lives and family 
relationships. Some of this works well. Catherine Hiller's writing has a 
refreshing sweetness, an innocence almost, which makes all the characters seem 
like people you'd want to have house-sit for you. Even with homelessness, 
despair and a mugging, there's still the sense that nothing truly awful will 
happen to these folks. A nice change. 
</P>
<P>
 Where "California Time" runs into trouble is its subject matter. The only 
burning question in this novel is which members of the Simon family are going 
to adjust to Los Angeles life and which members are not. The other, infinitely 
more interesting and subtle questions concerning human relationships get short 
shrift or no shrift at all. "California Time" has only one note and although 
it's a good note, round and rich, many readers are looking for a whole song.

 LOVE CAN BUILD A BRIDGE by Naomi Judd with Budd Schaetzle (Villard Books: $24; 
546 pp.) The life story of now-retired country singer Naomi Judd feel as if it 
were based on a TV mini-series.There's the teen-age pregnancy, poverty, a dream 
that wouldn't die, the phenomenal overnight success of the Judd duo, Naomi and 
daughter Wynona, and finally, Naomi's early retirement due to liver disease. 
</P>
<P>
 This is all chronicled in "Love Can Build a Bridge," a book that, while not 
stylistically remarkable, practically sweats Naomi Judd's personality from 
every sentence so that by the last page many readers will feel as if they've 
known her all their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first half of "Love Can Build a Bridge" Naomi Judd's pithy remarks and 
positive attitude serve the story well. "There are two kind of jobs: for one 
you shower before you go to work, for the other you shower after the work's 
done. Me, I may glisten if it's hot, but I don't like to sweat." Judd's refusal 
to give up in the face of bone-crushing poverty is truly inspiring, however, 
once the Judds are firmly ensconced in world-wide fame, the book loses a lot of 
its edge and ultimately becomes repetitious. This is strange because Naomi 
Judd's tooth and nail fight with incurable hepatitis should be powerful stuff, 
yet it feels a little flat. Muffled. Even the language changes. "Already 
polluted by unrelenting misery, my body's reaction to the introductory 
interferon shot exaggerated my discomfort almost beyond my ability to 
withstand." 
</P>
<P>
 One notable exception to the weak second half is the chapter describing the 
Judds' farewell concert, a beautiful, evocative piece of writing that stands 
all on its own.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Slicing and dicing their adversaries with precision, the Ninja are once again 
on the rampage in American Ninja (KTLA Sunday at 6 p.m.), a violent, 
super-charged adventure that breathes new life into the martial arts genre. It 
resounds with verve and enthusiasm, thanks to Sam Firstenberg, a savvy young 
action director. The latest romp finds the deadliest art of Asia in the hands 
of American GI Joe Armstong (Michael Dudikoff), a taciturn loner who's part of 
an Army convoy in the Philippines ambushed by the dreaded Ninja. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrast that with Platoon Leader (KTLA Sunday at 8 p.m.), an inept, 
stereotyped 1988 movie for which audiences may also be hopelessly ungrateful. 
It's a weird hybrid: a film that tries to mix the irreverent grunginess and 
profanity of Oliver Stone's "Platoon" with the gung-ho, flag-waving and 
hero-worshipping of "Rambo," presenting us in the process, the manhood rites of 
a young lieutenant (Michael Dudikoff, again). 
</P>
<P>
 Slap Shot (KTLA Monday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 6 p.m.), a 1977 comedy about a 
third-rate ice hockey team driven to play dirty, is loaded with homophobic 
locker-room humor. It's not that such talk isn't authentic, it's that the film 
endorses such talk rather than sending it. Paul Newman stars. 
</P>
<P>
 King of New York (KTLA Wednesday at 8 p.m., Saturday at 8 p.m.) is one of 
virtuoso of Abel Ferrara's most stylish films. Christopher Walken plays a 
feared New York crime lord who, at the start of the 1990 film, is released from 
prison after five years, with detention having inflamed his do-gooder's soul: 
He plans to strong-arm the city's drug lords into redistributing their booty to 
the poor. This strategy, involving a morality play at the service of great gobs 
of mayhem, is more hypocritical than usual, considering Ferrera's filmmaking 
instincts are so clearly on the side of violence. But the film, which has 
passages of surpassing lunacy, is never boring. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1987 The Principal (KTLA Thursday at 8 p.m.), with Jim Belushi in the 
title role, takes on one of the best subjects imaginable, the tensions and 
conflicts at an inner-city high school, and turns it into one more 
cliche-ridden revenge movie. 
</P>
<P>
 The Statue of Liberty (KCET Thursday at 8 p.m.) and Huey Long (KCET Friday at 
9 p.m.) are two captivating and comprehensive 1985 documentaries by "The Civil 
War's" Ken Burns.

 I BELIEVE IN ANGELS by Fiona Cooper (Serpent's Tail:  
</P>
</TEXT>
<TYPE>
<P>
 Yet, in spite of these obvious differences, every story feels strangely alike. 
Fiona Cooper is a friendly writer, an enthusiastic writer, but she's also a 
writer with an agenda. Even in the darker stories, her overwhelming message 
seems to be, "Love life!" and while that's certainly worthwhile, it sometimes 
feels as if Cooper is prodding her characters to inspire us with whimsy, much 
the way a mother will prod her child to play the oboe in a class recital. 
</P>
<P>
 The exception to this is the book's centerpiece, "Ilsa's War," a story about 
the relationship between a frustrated writer and an irreverent old woman. 
Although the request to love life is still a very large component, it goes down 
much easier when accompanied by interesting three-dimensional characters who 
help us ask the questions instead of giving us all the answers.

THREE ON THE TOWN: ROLLING WITH THE FLOW; THEY MIGHT BE CO-OPTING CUTTING-EDGE 
RAP, BUT IT'S HIS BEAT AND HE'LL STICK WITH IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jonathan Gold

<TEXT>
<P>
 It is 20 minutes to 10, and my friends are all inside. I am sitting in my car, 
parked a block down from the restaurant, listening to somebody named Tina 
dedicate a song to her boyfriend, Frank. I half-wonder why I am listening to 
the radio by myself in the cold when strong coffee and companionship are so 
close at hand, but the rap song "G-Thang" starts to play, and I am happy with 
the beat, and the deejay follows up with Domino's "Ghetto Jam," which is a song 
that I could listen to all night. 
</P>
<P>
 I am waiting for my favorite five minutes of radio to come on, a segment 
called "Roll Call," where young listeners from Compton, from Whittier, from 
Beverly Hills dial KPWR and rap a few lines over the air, usually haltingly at 
first, building into a sort of awkward grace, a geeky, teen-age swagger that 
usually disappears about five minutes after a rapper walks into a recording 
studio for the first time. If you tune in often enough, you learn the names of 
most of the callers, you trace the evolution of their styles, from generic rap 
to Ice Cube guttural to Snoop Doggy Dogg smooth. You can predict which day most 
of the rhymes might include salty couplets about Michael Jackson, or which 
budding rapper will be cut off when he leans a little blue. 
</P>
<P>
 I've spent an eccentric amount of time lately listening to KPWR, a dance-music 
station with a peculiar mix of bass-heavy hip-hop, saccharine ballads and 
"old-school," which has come to mean, roughly, songs you might have heard on an 
L.A.-based R & B station in 1983 -- Rick James, the Gap Band, Vanity 6. The mix 
seems to work; KPWR is consistently among the highest-rated in the city, and 
such old-school superstars as Zapp & Roger chart massively higher in Southern 
California than in the rest of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Where old-album rock radio seemed to play "Stairway to Heaven" every 15 
minutes, KPWR plays "The Message," and between Grandmaster Flash's original and 
Ice Cube's contemporary reworking, you can count on hearing the song at least 
twice on an average commute. It is comforting that one of the nation's most 
famous morning jocks could have been knocked off the air by what amounts to a 
bunch of goofs talking about football and girls. And I found it kind of nice 
when KPWR's brass decided to bleep out the nasty words in hard-core rap songs 
rather than ban the music altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 It is peculiar, though, to inadvertently find oneself part of a target market; 
it also feels odd to have one's meager lode of '80s nostalgia mined so 
precisely, from the heavy electrobeat breathing of the Egyptian Lover, to Melle 
Mel's "White Lines," to early L. L. Cool J, to . . . oh Lord! . . . the yo 
bay-bee, yo bay-bee yo that used to define West Coast rap music before Ice-T 
discovered his gangsta muse deep within the barrel of an Uzi. The stuff makes 
me feel the sort of vague longing that my dad must have felt hearing a Jo 
Stafford song 20 years later on "The Swinging Years." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes nothing annoys a certain kind of person more than having popular 
consensus swing around to agree with his taste. Who wants to stand in line at 
the Forum to see a band you used to rock out to at tiny Hollywood clubs; who's 
happy when the friendly hip-hop crew whose tapes he bought out of somebody's 
trunk develops into the Beatles of vulgar rap? Some degree of success is fine 
-- you don't want the terrific Malaysian novelist you champion to remain so 
obscure that even Susan Sontag has a hard time placing her name -- but in a 
culture where hipness is measured by how many left-field obsessions you can 
claim, extreme popularity can only debase the currency: Who wants to be just 
getting into Edith Wharton right now? 
</P>
<P>
 But sometimes it's better to flow with a groove than to fight against it, 
especially when you like the beat. The "Roll Call" music pumped through the 
car, there were enough Michael Jackson japes to fill a monthful of Letterman 
monologues, and as I had hoped, I got back to the restaurant just in time for 
the second course.

 Ever wonder why Frere Jacques overslept, despite the ringing of the morning 
bells? And what was fragile Humpty Dumpty doing sitting on that high wall, 
anyway? HBO offers an answer, via the The Real Story of . . ., a 
"behind-the-scenes" animated fable of traditional and familiar stories, songs 
and nursery rhymes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it would be a lot of fun to take what children knew and invent a 
story behind them, just in the form of entertainment," says Carol Rosen, vice 
president of Family Programming at HBO. "We put together writers and music 
people and had a lot of fun with the concept." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, a clockmaker and his grandson nearly lose their shop due to an ancient 
curse in "The Real Story of Sur Le Pont D'Avignon," featuring the voice of 
Robert Guillaume. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Milton Berle lends his voice to "The Real Story of Au Clair De La 
Lune." The Prince of Darkness puts Pierrot in a deep slumber, since Pierrot has 
turned night into day. Fortunately, a plucky moth comes to the rescue and saves 
both Pierrot and the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Other upcoming fables include tales based on "O' Christmas Tree," "Twinkle 
Twinkle Little Star" and "Here Comes the Bride." 
</P>
<P>

DANCE; HE PUTS A SPIN ON THE PSYCHE; THE TENSIONS OF MODERN TIMES -- AND 
RELATIONSHIPS -- WILL ALWAYS DRIVE THE WORK OF CHOREOGRAPHER JOHN MALASHOCK. 
BUT AFTER CHANGES IN HIS TROUPE AND HIS OWN SHIFTING INTERESTS, HIS DANCES 
REFLECT A SEARCH FOR CONNECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE STEINBERG, Janice Steinberg is a free-lance dance writer based in San 
Diego. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Malashock winced when asked about ambitions he may have for his 
5-year-old modern dance company. 
</P>
<P>
 "That dirty word -- ambition ," said the choreographer and founder of San 
Diego-based Malashock Dance & Company, which will perform three new works at 
UCLA on Friday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 What's so bad about ambition? 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a difference between ambition and drive," said Malashock, a former 
Twyla Tharp dancer. "Drive is what forces you to do the work; it's a necessity. 
Ambition has more to do with success in the outer world." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether or not Malashock considers himself ambitious, his sights have always 
extended beyond his native San Diego. After receiving a bachelor's degree in 
dance from Southern Methodist University in 1975, he landed a spot with the 
Utah Repertory Dance Theatre. His next stop, in 1977, was Paris, where he 
performed and choreographed for the Ballet Blaska for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to the United States, he was accepted into Tharp's company. His 
five-year career with Tharp included dancing in the film "Amadeus" and in 
numerous television specials, as well as participating in a benefit performance 
with Mikhail Baryshnikov. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, married and with a young son, Malashock came home to San Diego, first 
to attempt to lead "a normal life," working in -- he noted reluctantly -- real 
estate development. 
</P>
<P>
 "Talk about feeling like a fish out of water!" said the choreographer, whose 
boyishly handsome face, framed by well-cut blond curls, belies his 39 years. 
</P>
<P>
 For two years, Malashock didn't perform and even avoided going to dance 
concerts. He eventually realized "there was something too large missing." A 
hunger to create work led him back to the studio, and his experience in dancing 
with one of the top companies in the world led him to conceive a troupe that, 
he hoped, would have an audience that could extend beyond his San Diego home. 
</P>
<P>
 Soft-spoken but displaying the same intensity that appears in his dances, he 
said, "I have a strong desire to prove that a dance company can exist outside 
of New York and still function on the level that gives a company a broad 
reputation, the ability to function nationally or internationally." 
</P>
<P>
 The recession, brutal financially to every arts organization, has limited 
Malashock's budget -- to a peak of $175,000 this year -- and curtailed his 
ability to tour. The company performs several times a year in San Diego, where 
it has established a residency at the Old Globe Theatre, consisting of office 
space and an annual performance there. This year's run at the Old Globe 
concludes today with two performances. 
</P>
<P>
 But the company has appeared only twice in the Los Angeles area, most recently 
at Cal State Long Beach in 1992, and only once in New York, also in 1992. It 
has also performed elsewhere in California and in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, according to a number of critics, Malashock has all the right 
stuff to merit a national audience. Times dance writer Lewis Segal praised him 
as "the Southern California choreographer most in touch with the panic and 
isolation of contemporary life." Dance critic Anne Marie Welsh, writing in the 
San Diego Union-Tribune, called Malashock's dances "as fascinating as almost 
any in contemporary dance." 
</P>
<P>
 Many other reviews have been equally glowing. Most have noted Malashock's 
distinctive emotional power -- the way he uses movement to reveal the raw 
psyche beneath the surface persona, in particular his seemingly hopeless, often 
savage depiction of struggles between women and men. 
</P>
<P>
 Married to his psychotherapist wife, Nina, for 14 years and the father of an 
11-year-old son, Duncan, Malashock cautioned against interpreting his 
relationship dances too literally. 
</P>
<P>
 "That there's tension, that there's anger, that there's conflict -- to me I 
haven't been dealing with a male-female thing. It's more personal than that -- 
it's almost like battling with oneself." 
</P>
<P>
 Not one to let criticism roll off his back, he said, "I heard at one point an 
accusation that my work was sexist. I puzzled over that for a long time. I 
asked a lot of people whether they felt that was some sort of presence in the 
work. I didn't feel that was the case. Yet I would see how somebody watching 
might be sensitized to certain things. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, where the bleakness comes in doesn't have so much to do with 
male-female relationships. It's more about relationship to oneself and to the 
world out there, which is not an easy place." 
</P>
<P>
 That's a relationship that is changing. Two of his four dancers left the 
company last year, forcing Malashock to regroup as well as to recruit new 
dancers. The process resulted in adding another person, so there are now three 
women and three men, including the choreographer. It also produced a shift, 
though not a profound change, in artistic direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm always going to be strongly interested in the really personal, 
introspective type of work," he said. "But whether that takes on the anger that 
maybe my earlier work did or more a kind of spirituality, I don't know. It's 
really going to depend on what's bubbling inside me." 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Near Reaches," a new work that the company will perform at UCLA, 
Malashock explores the spirituality of his own Jewish heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having not been given any real connection to a spirituality or religiousness, 
I almost have to find a way of reintegrating it myself," said the 
choreographer, who grew up in an extremely secular family. "Creating dance work 
is certainly the closest I've come to faith of some sort. It's strange talking 
about this stuff," he added, laughing self-consciously. 
</P>
<P>
 Guided by Cantor Deborah Bard, he discovered a suite of Sephardic songs from 
15th-Century Spain performed by Montserrat Figueras. To Figueras' haunting 
soprano, "The Near Reaches" opens with a duet in which female dancer Debi Toth 
and male Francis Floro, both bare-chested, maintain physical contact for 
virtually the entire movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Explaining his decision to have Toth topless, Malashock said: "It has nothing 
to do with anything sexual -- it's sensual, it's the feel of skin. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a sense of community in that piece for me," he said, "and yet a sense 
of individualism, a kind of spirituality and sensuality that's all wrapped up 
together. I think, in a way, that's a view of how things can be. I don't see 
things being as clearly defined anymore in life, where there's a rigid 
separation between my spiritual life and my regular life. That's why I say even 
though it's to the Sephardic music, which speaks to me, it's not a Jewish 
piece, it's a spiritual piece." 
</P>
<P>
 Malashock may be best known for his introspective, emotional pieces, but his 
body of work also includes two other types of dances -- abstract responses to 
music and collaborations. 
</P>
<P>
 His music-based work will be represented at UCLA through "Souvenir de 
Florence," which came about through a commission from the San Diego Symphony, 
which asked him to create a dance for its Tchaikovsky Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Tchaikovsky would hardly have been Malashock's first choice -- his other 
music-based works have scores by Leos Janacek, Jimi Hendrix and Leonard Cohen 
-- but, as in the Janacek piece, Malashock used Tchaikovsky's music to both 
explore and challenge traditional structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be pointless to just make a visual representation of that music. Why 
bother?" he said. "Plus, the music suggests a kind of vocabulary that isn't my 
natural vocabulary. I had to let my own movement come out. . . . I felt like 
there was room for humor along with the straight romanticism, an off-balance 
feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tchaikovsky piece is the most technically demanding he has created, 
Malashock said. "There's more jumping and lifting than in any other dance I've 
done before. It requires a kind of ensemble precision that is deceptively 
difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 "Souvenir de Florence" also moves at a relentless pace. "Don't worry if my 
face turns purple," dancer Gwen Hunter Ritchie called out in a recent 
rehearsal. "It always does." 
</P>
<P>
 (Hunter Ritchie, from Washington, D.C., is one of the company's new members, 
as are New Yorker Peter G. Kalivas and San Diegan Floro. They join Toth and Maj 
Xander, who have been with Malashock since the troupe started.) 
</P>
<P>
 In the realm of collaborative work, Malashock's efforts have had mixed 
results. His "Apologies from the Lower Deck," a tragicomical combination of 
movement, narrative and music, has pleased both audiences and critics since its 
1991 premiere. But a 1992 piece created with San Diego flamenco artist Yaelisa 
has garnered many less-than-enthusiastic reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 The choreographer continues to be drawn to collaboration, however, often with 
artists outside the world of dance. "Their Thought and Back Again," also on the 
UCLA program, was developed with the resident composer at the La Jolla 
Playhouse, Michael Roth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's claiming a ground that's not firmly in dance, not firmly in theater," 
Malashock said. "It's in song form musically, and it has a very loose sense of 
story." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to having two singers onstage, the piece will be accompanied by 
Roth on piano, a cellist and a violinist. Malashock is already planning his 
next collaboration, an evening-length project with UC San Diego 
professor-playwright Allan Havis. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Malashock resists attaching specific meanings to his movement 
vocabulary, his response was quite personal when he spoke of one characteristic 
gesture -- a hand or arm shaking out of control, as the other hand struggles to 
restrain it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I spend so much energy trying to keep things controlled," Malashock 
said. "It's pointless because everything is so unpredictable. I think that's a 
struggle a lot of people have, not feeling comfortable enough to just let 
things be out of control, and yet knowing you need a certain amount of letting 
go or else you're beating your head against the wall all the time." 
</P>

CRIMINAL PURSUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The veteran British writer on espionage, Ted Allbeury, is said to have been 
the model for Len Deighton's Harry Palmer in "The Ipcress File." Allbeury 
served in British Intelligence during World War II and has since written more 
than 30 novels about spies and spying. If he is not quite the literary stylist 
John LeCarre is, he writes about spying with the same candor, authority and 
lack of cloak-and-dagger histrionics. 
</P>
<P>
 His new book, SHOW ME A HERO (Mysterious Press: $21.95, 369 pp.) is 
cryptically described as "based on truth," and is a fascinating account of a 
young Russian spy, a devoted second-generation Communist, who is assigned to 
New York. Behind his cover as a book dealer, he recruits an effective network 
of informants (one of his contacts is Klaus Fuchs). 
</P>
<P>
 As years pass he becomes increasingly disillusioned with the Soviet 
leadership, and worried that the confrontational Kremlin leaders will (and are 
willing to) provoke World War III. The spy, Andrei Aarons, becomes a kind of 
double agent, advising Harry Truman and John Kennedy on his reading of Moscow 
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an abundantly detailed story, from the minutiae of spy-craft made 
familiar by both Allbeury and LeCarre, to the glimpses of Kremlin infighting. 
</P>
<P>
 The large cast of characters includes Nikita Khrushchev as well as Aarons' 
loyal siblings, two remarkable wives and his high-placed Soviet mentor, himself 
grown bitterly disillusioned. 
</P>
<P>
 An insightful portrait of a complicated man, and a special glimpse of history, 
Allbeury's book is suspenseful despite the lack of traditional whiz-bang 
plotting, and it is a useful reminder of just how near at hand war was in the 
hottest of the Cold War years. 
</P>
<P>
 Another retrieving of the Cold War, a good deal less persuasive than 
Allbeury's, is William F. Buckley Jr.'s A VERY PRIVATE PLOT (Morrow: $20, 269 
pp.), the latest outing for his CIA operative, Blackford Oakes, now head of 
covert operations for the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The cumbersome structure makes the story a flashback from 1995, when a liberal 
version of Jesse Helms is seeking to ban by law all covert operations. When 
Oakes won't discuss a particular past operation, the senator has him jailed for 
contempt of Congress. The book is a teasing out of the facts of that operation. 
</P>
<P>
 A small knot of zealots in Moscow was plotting to assassinate Gorbachev for 
betraying the ideals of the revolution. The CIA learned of it and could foil 
the plot -- if President Reagan chose to foil it. Since Gorbachev has recently 
acted in a movie there is no real suspense, of course, and the past tense 
narrative contributes to the undermining of the drama, even though the plotters 
are watched close-up. 
</P>
<P>
 But the politico-moral dilemma the president and the CIA face -- to betray the 
plotters they must also betray their source -- is provocative and Buckley has a 
good time with it. Like Allbeury, he finds Soviet functionaries sorely torn 
between loyalty and wisdom. The author catches Reagan's voice very well. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a potentially engrossing story, not helped by the expository structure, 
and only partially redeemed by Buckley's splendid air of confidence. (He makes 
a fleeting appearance in the story.) 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Dibdin's previous novel, "Cabal," was an intricate tale of evil deeds 
in and about the Vatican. His new one, THE DYING OF THE LIGHT (Pantheon: $19, 
151 pp.) is wildly and enchantingly unlike it. 
</P>
<P>
 The guests in a parlor of a country house sound like refugees from Agatha 
Christie: the colonel, the wealthy invalid lady, the entrepreneur incessantly 
on the telephone and so on. A Jane Marple-like figure chatting with her friend 
sees them all, if you believe her, as suspects in a murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't believe her. They're all inmates in a ghastly nursing home run by an 
alcoholic sadist and his sister. Imposing a murder plot is a ploy by two of the 
women to keep sane in maddening circumstances. And in Dibdin's unusually 
creative plot, a real death occurs, and the ploy becomes a plot to make the 
police dig deeper. The surprising plot twists are without end. Hardly longer 
than a novella, Dibdin's book succeeds in using a light- hearted tone to make a 
harrowing situation more moving, not less. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Langton writes of New England matters and illustrates her novels with her 
own charming pen and ink drawings. DIVINE INSPIRATION (Viking: $20; 408 pp.) 
centers on a Boston church that is getting a magnificent new organ. One learns 
much about the spitzflute and the trumpet en chamade and the tuning of an 
organ. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, there is the abandoned baby crawling up the church steps, and the 
missing mother, who is or was an organist, and unexplained fires and 
vandalization and, like an ominous murmur throughout, the matter of the 
decaying piles that sustain the great Gothic church. A "Laura"-like love story, 
a vivid cadre of organists and a much-beset minister are further pleasures in 
Langton's lively work. Prof. Homer Kelly, ex-detective, is her resident sleuth 
but this time he is largely an acolyte to the principals. 
</P>
<P>
 DEADLY ADMIRER (Walker & Co.: $19.95; 197 pp.) is a second novel by Christine 
Green, an English writer who trained as a nurse, about Kate Kinsella, a private 
eye who goes back to nursing when things get slow. This time, working the 
emergency ward, she treats another nurse who has just checked after attempting 
suicide but changing her mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The almost-suicide is deeply disturbed and imagines she's being followed. 
Given the genre, we had best believe she's not wrong. She is a visiting nurse 
and one of her country patients is murdered. Nurse Kinsella traces the troubles 
to a sad, surprising end, and the book is the better for the authenticity of 
the work and the provincial England where it takes place. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Gilbert, who wrote his first mysteries on his lap, commuting to work 
as a London lawyer, is now in his 82nd year and one of the deans of British 
crime fiction. His 27th novel, ROLLERCOASTER (Carroll & Graf: $19.95; 250 pp.), 
features his continuing London detective Patrick Petrella, now a superintendent 
in the Docklands area of the Thames on the east side of London. 
</P>
<P>
 The book is a fast-moving and atmospheric police procedural likely to remind 
constant readers of the excellent series on Gideon of Scotland Yard by the late 
John Creasey. More than one problem confronts Petrella: racial gangs on the 
prowl, charges of police brutality underscored when an investigative reporter 
for the accusing newspaper is murdered, a nasty trade in child pornography 
(photographed in Amsterdam, distributed in England); the consumers including 
influential men capable of hamstringing the police. 
</P>
<P>
 As writers age, their books sometimes grow more sedentary, like the writers 
themselves. Not so Gilbert. His book rockets along, with car chases, stealthy 
pursuits, head-bashings, stakeouts and a final intimation that police work, 
too, is like housework and sex; it never stays done.

PALM LATITUDES: STATE OF MIND; THE MOST DANGEROUS GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael Tenneson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My partner and I are approaching a stolen pickup in a Downtown parking 
structure when the door of its camper shell suddenly flies open and a large man 
sits up, aims a shotgun at me and starts firing. My heart pumping, I raise my 
revolver and return fire. My shots miss. His don't. 
</P>
<P>
 No, this is not a fax from heaven, it's a report on the Simulator, a $62,000 
interactive, computer-monitored training tool used by the Los Angeles Police 
Academy and most other big-city police departments. Cadets use laser "guns" to 
fire at life-size perpetrators on a huge rear-projection video screen. By 
monitoring the accuracy and legality of the shots, it provides a way to grade 
cadets on their understanding of LAPD use-of-force guidelines, which allow an 
officer to fire a gun only in the "immediate defense of life." 
</P>
<P>
 But as I found out, with perps firing "bullets" at you, making those decisions 
requires extraordinary cool. "Five misses, no hits," Officer Don Kiefer tells 
me after my performance with the pickup. "Keep your eye on that front sight." 
</P>
<P>
 Scenario 2: My partner and I are patrolling a shopping center when we spot a 
young man trying to break into an ATM. The felon responds by first pulling a 
knife, then tossing it aside and pulling out a gun. I get off five rounds 
before he gets off any. The Simulator tells me my first shot was through the 
felon's heart, the rest went through his left shoulder. I want to quit (this is 
too real to be fun), but Kiefer wants me to do one more. 
</P>
<P>
 Scenario 3: We are walking through a park when a kid rushes up to report a 
strange man trying to abduct his friend. Approaching, we see a man about 45 
dragging a small boy out of the park. When the man sees us, he reaches into his 
back pocket and quickly pulls out . . . his wallet! My gun's up, but I don't 
shoot. "Good going!" says Kiefer. "You did well." 
</P>
<P>
 The thought crosses my mind that I would rather take the chance of shooting an 
innocent man than having a guilty one shoot me. Cops aren't allowed to make 
that choice. Michael Tenneson

PALM LATITUDES: IN EXCESS; TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING 
</P>

<P>
 Sandra Boss recycles everything . "I have no trash," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 You might think that would have thrilled the city of Encinitas, which has had 
a mandatory recycling ordinance since 1992.Instead, it landed her in 
bureaucratic hot water. 
</P>
<P>
 Her saga began in July of 1992, when Boss, a retired nurse, tried to cancel 
her $16.79-a-month trash service. But city health codes mandated a weekly trash 
pickup or a trip to the dump, so she took her case to the City Council. After 
months of back-and-forth phone calls, she was told early last year that she 
could indeed quit paying her trash bill -- if she'd attach dump receipts to the 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
 She pressed her case for another six months, and the city finally told Boss to 
pay up or face a lien on her property. 
</P>
<P>
 Boss then found "a little sentence" in the city codes that allows recycling 
services as an alternative to trash pickups, and with some help from the mayor, 
a greener path was cleared. Now Boss saves her recycling receipts and clips 
them to her bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The only drawback to her fight with City Hall: The local publicity "has made 
me look like the Mother Teresa of recycling." Sharon Whitley

OSCARS; THE LIST BEGINS WITH 'SCHINDLER'; AS NOMINATION BALLOTS MAKE THEIR WAY 
TO ACADEMY VOTERS, TWO THINGS ARE CLEAR: SPIELBERG'S EPIC IS OUT IN FRONT OF A 
VERY CROWDED PACK 
</P>

<P>
 The 1993 Oscar race is shaping up as a particularly unusual affair, a 
competition in which the eventual winners are easier to predict than the 
contenders for the crown. 
</P>
<P>
 Here it is, only a month before the Feb. 9 nomination announcements, and the 
field is so crowded with possible selections that handicapping the five 
nominees in key categories is as difficult as it has been in years. 
</P>
<P>
 But picking the eventual winners, at least in the four major categories, feels 
suspiciously like a snap. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason for the horde of combatants is that two films released at 
the end of the year specifically for academy consideration actually do have 
possible nominees in them. Both "In the Name of the Father" and "Shadowlands" 
are good bets to place selections in the final five, though actually winning 
anything is much more of a long shot. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, most of the reason for the ease of predicting the final 
winners comes down to two words: "Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 Rarely has a film possessed the kind of serious subject matter the academy 
loves to recognize with the best picture Oscar delivered so thoroughly on its 
potential. Reports indicate an enormous crush at the door before the 
"Schindler's List" official academy screenings, and one voter who got in 
claimed "if they could have given the Oscar right then, they would have done 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Picking the other four best picture nominees is trickier because several of 
the contenders share not only the same genteel sensibility but also the same 
actors. Both "Shadowlands" and "The Remains of the Day" have literary 
antecedents, academy-type directors (Richard Attenborough and James Ivory) and 
stellar performances by Anthony Hopkins, and either or both could be nominated, 
though off the Golden Globes nominations "Remains of the Day" seems a safer 
bet. 
</P>
<P>
 Also relatively safe are "Philadelphia," its do-goodism too good to be 
resisted, and the old-fashioned oomph of "In the Name of the Father." "The 
Piano" should also get a nomination, but with the academy, as opposed to 
critics' groups, it is something of a long shot. Similarly, "The Age of 
Innocence" has not aroused any noticeable degree of passion among Oscar 
watchers, and though it can't be counted out, it will probably have better 
success in other categories. 
</P>
<P>
 In the best director competition, once again, despite what all those critics' 
groups did or didn't do, Steven Spielberg is not only a sure nominee but also 
the early favorite to break his longstanding jinx and take home the Oscar on 
March 21. 
</P>
<P>
 His fellow nominees will be a familiar group. While his film may not get a 
nod, "Innocence's" Martin Scorsese should be picked by his peers, as will "In 
the Name of the Father's" Jim Sheridan (previously nominated for "My Left 
Foot") and "Piano's" Jane Campion, who would be only the second woman to be so 
much as nominated (the first was Lina Wertmuller, for "Seven Beauties" in 
1976). 
</P>
<P>
 Academy favorites Ivory and Attenborough probably will round out the group for 
"Remains" and "Shadowlands," leaving both "Short Cuts' " Robert Altman and 
"Philadelphia's" Jonathan Demme as the odd men out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Philadelphia" will gets its moment in the best actor category, where Tom 
Hanks, a solid Hollywood citizen doing fine work and even dying on screen in a 
socially conscious role, is not only sure to be nominated but also the best bet 
to be the winner as well. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Best actor turns out to be one of the most crowded of categories, but 
nominations do seem likely to go to Daniel Day-Lewis for his fiery turn in "In 
the Name of the Father," Liam Neeson for personifying "Schindler's List" and 
the protean Anthony Hopkins for either "Remains of the Day" or "Shadowlands." 
</P>
<P>
 The final slot is pretty much up for grabs, with hunks like Kevin Costner ("A 
Perfect World"), Clint Eastwood ("In the Line of Fire") and Harrison Ford ("The 
Fugitive") all having a shot. Unfortunately, three of the best male 
performances of the year (David Thewlis in "Naked," Dennis Quaid in "Flesh and 
Bone" and Jeff Bridges in "Fearless") were probably not seen by enough voters 
to make a difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Best actress, as always, seems the unfortunate case, a much less crowded 
category, which this year means less competition for Holly Hunter in "The 
Piano." An outstanding piece of work in a difficult, showy role by an 
industryite in good standing, this performance should have no trouble either 
being nominated or winning the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 To fill out that category, the actors branch will probably fall back on 
familiar faces, which means always dependable Emma Thompson, the ideal foil for 
Hopkins, in "The Remains of the Day"; a miscast but vital Michelle Pfeiffer for 
"The Age of Innocence" and a reborn Debra Winger in either "A Dangerous Woman" 
or "Shadowlands," probably the latter though the former is the stronger work. 
</P>
<P>
 The last slot is, as with the actors, a toss-up, the key contenders being 
Stockard Channing in "Six Degrees of Separation," and, if the academy can 
remember that far back, Angela Bassett in the neglected "What's Love Got to Do 
With It" and perennial favorite Jodie Foster in "Sommersby." 
</P>
<P>
 The supporting categories parallel the best actor and actress, with a great 
number of potential nominees to choose from among the men and much less of a 
selection among the women. 
</P>
<P>
 Top of the list for supporting actors are the summer's most memorable dark 
forces, Tommy Lee Jones for "The Fugitive" and John Malkovich for "In the Line 
of Fire." "Schindler's List" will contribute at least Ralph Fiennes as the icy 
Nazi nemesis and possibly Ben Kingsley as Schindler's right-hand man. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurence Fishburne certainly deserves no less than a nomination for "What's 
Love," but the film may not have been enough seen. Other top contenders are 
Sean Penn for "Carlito's Way," Gene Hackman for "The Firm" and, perhaps the 
likeliest of long shots, young-man-on-the-rise Leonardo DeCaprio for his 
remarkable work in "What's Eating Gilbert Grape." 
</P>
<P>
 Turning to supporting actress, four performances immediately come to mind, two 
of them by women who are likely best actress nominees as well. Both Emma 
Thompson in "In the Name of the Father" and Holly Hunter in "The Firm" are in 
line to pull off the neat trick of being double-nominated in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
 The other two supporting actress performances are, if anything, stronger. Both 
Rosie Perez, taking a more serious turn in "Fearless," and Winona Rider, 
letter-perfect in "The Age of Innocence," are the pick of the crop this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Picking a fifth nominee, however, is quite a challenge. The academy might go 
with one of the women from "Short Cuts," possibly Lily Tomlin or Jennifer Jason 
Leigh; one of the exceptional group that energized "The Joy Luck Club," or, if 
the branch is feeling adventurous, Gwyneth Paltrow's striking work in "Flesh 
and Bone." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the screenplay categories, there is a roadblock of sizable proportions in 
the adaptation category. Steven Zaillian should be nominated for "Schindler's 
List" (though "Searching for Bobby Fischer" is also worthy) and the same goes 
for Jay Cocks and Scorsese for "The Age of Innocence," Ruth Prawer Jhabvahla 
for "Remains of the Day," William Nicholson for "Shadowlands" and possibly even 
John Guare for "Six Degrees of Separation" and Terry George and Jim Sheridan 
for "In the Name of the Father." While they are long shots, two of the most 
difficult adaptations, Robert Altman and Frank Barhydt for "Short Cuts" and Amy 
Tan and Ron Bass for "The Joy Luck Club," might just sneak in as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Jane Campion's script for "The Piano" and Ron Nyswaner's for 
"Philadelphia" are mentioned, the list for best original screenplay is 
considerably smaller. Though the academy has been known to stay away from 
comedies, given a solid shot for inclusion this year is the more lighthearted 
Nora Ephron/David Ward/Jeff Arch script for "Sleepless in Seattle." Also 
possible are "Groundhog Day," "Dave" and maybe even, as a remembrance of summer 
past, "In the Line of Fire." It was that kind of a year.

PLAM LATITUDES: CLOSE-UP; BLIMPED OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gordon Dillow 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most professional pilots live for speed. But pilot Nick Nicolary lives for 
slow. In fact, he's one of the slowest pilots in the skies. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicolary flies a 192-foot-long, 202,000-cubic-foot bag of gas that has a top 
speed of only 54 m.p.h. -- the Goodyear blimp Eagle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love flying the blimp," says Nicolary, 52, who has been a blimp pilot for 
26 years and has 10,000 hours of flying them under his belt. "Mostly because of 
the people you get to meet. Everybody gets a kick out of riding in the blimp." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Chuck Yeager, the man who broke the sound barrier, who rode the blimp one 
day in the early 1980s. "That was one of the best rides I ever had," Nicolary 
says. "Only problem was, I wanted to talk about breaking the sound barrier and 
he wanted to talk about the blimp. Of course, I let him fly it. He had a 
natural feel for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Though their highest-profile job is providing bird's-eye views of athletic and 
other events -- in return for which the networks broadcast shots of the blimp 
at least once each hour -- the airships are also used as flying electronic 
billboards. Rides on the six-passenger blimp, one of three Goodyear craft 
across the country, are not available to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodyear has never had a passenger fatality since its first blimp went up more 
than 60 years ago, but there have been a few close calls. In 1990, a 
radio-controlled model airplane collided with the Eagle while it was flying 
over the South Bay, tearing a foot-square gash in its rubber-lined polyester 
skin. Nicolary landed it safely. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great job," says Nicolary, who is one of five Eagle pilots. "Who 
wouldn't enjoy a job like this? After all, everyone loves a blimp." Gordon 
Dillow

 BABY INSANE AND THE BUDDHA by Bob Sipchen (Bantam: $5.95; 417 pp.). Times 
writer Bob Sipchen traces the intertwined lives of Kevin Glass -- "Baby Insane" 
of the Neighborhood Crips gang -- and Patrick Birse, the San Diego police 
officer known as the Buddha because of his rotund shape and unflinching 
gaze.Birse's battle to convert Glass from a felon to an informer/undercover 
agent reads like a good crime novel, marred only by the author's occasional 
tendency to ramble. Sipchen's often gripping account of the amoral life of 
theft, drugs and cold-blooded murder lead by members of the gang subculture 
leaves the reader uneasy, not only for the future of Southern California, but 
for the survival of an increasingly frayed social contract.

 WOMEN OF NEW MEXICO: Depression Era Images edited by Marta Weigle (Ancient 
City Press, P.O. Box 5401, Santa Fe, N.M. 87502: $17.95; 129 pp., paperback 
original). Weigle's chronicle of rural life in the Southwest features 
black-and-white photographs taken by the Farm Security Administration, 
supplemented with verbal descriptions from the New Mexico Federal Writers' 
Project/Program. The result is a vivid portrait of a vanished existence. 
Sequential images reveal how women made soap, baked bread in outdoor ovens, 
made adobe and plastered their homes. Yet only 55 years separate this New 
Mexico from the boutiques and golf courses of the modern state.

 THE GARBAGE PRIMER: A Handbook for Citizens by Pamela Murphy for the League of 
Women Voters Education Fund (Lyons & Burford: $12.95; 181 pp., paperback 
original). The numbers are staggering: Every year, Americans produce more than 
200 million tons of trash (not counting the scripts for "Melrose Place"), dump 
about 200 million gallons of used motor oil -- the equivalent of 18 Exxon 
Valdez spills -- into the nation's drains, and discard 242 million tires. This 
clear, well-organized overview examines the ever-increasing problem of waste 
disposal and presents the relative merits of various solutions. An excellent 
starting point for concerned citizens.

 WILL ROGERS' WORLD: America's Foremost Political Humorist Comments on the '20s 
and '30s -- and on the '80s and '90s edited by Bryan B. Sterling & Francis N. 
Sterling (M. Evans & Co.: $9.95; 242 pp., illustrated). Vaudeville headliner, 
movie star, newspaper columnist and radio personality, Will Rogers acted as a 
kind of wisecracking surrogate uncle to the nation during the '20s and '30s. 
Many of his observations remain remarkably timely, as the Sterlings demonstrate 
in this very funny anthology, e.g., "We are billions in the hole and will be 
billions more next year, and not a Congressman has got the nerve to ask voters 
to pay part of it in taxes."

 AMERICA AND THE FOUR JAPANS: Friend, Foe, Model, Mirror by Frederick L. Schodt 
(Stone Bridge Press: $10.95; 200 pp., paperback original). In this thoughtful 
study, Schodt examines American and Japanese attitudes toward each other's 
civilizations. Although linked by economic, cultural and diplomatic bonds, the 
two countries offer mirror-images of attitudes concerning work, family life, 
ethnicity and religion. Schodt concludes, "Our societies are profoundly similar 
and profoundly different at the same time, existing in complimentary balance, 
intertwined within a subscribed circle. The differences cause tension, but also 
attraction and hold out the possibility of extraordinary synergies." But as he 
also notes, attitudes in both countries frequently undergo radical shifts.

 FREEDOM'S CHILDREN: Young Civil Rights Activists Tell Their Own Stories edited 
by Ellen Levine (Avon: $3.99; 204 pp., illustrated). Aimed at juvenile readers, 
these memoirs offer an inside look at the segregated South and the struggle to 
reform it.Men and women recall the humiliation of being relegated to the back 
of the bus or not being allowed to try on clothes at department stores. Their 
anger lead them to the growing civil rights movement: They took part in 
boycotts, sit-ins, prayer meetings and Freedom Rides -- and braved mob 
violence, bombings and abuse from law enforcement officers. A worthy addition 
to any school or family library, "Freedom's Children" emphasizes the importance 
of mutual respect among citizens, at a time when many groups continue to fight 
for equality.

 GOOD GOSSIP by Jacqueline Carey (Ivy Books: $4.99; 180 pp.). In these stories 
set in trendy lower Manhattan, Carey tries to create the heterosexual 
equivalent of the gay comedies of mannerisms epitomized by the fiction of Ethan 
Mordden, but the attempt doesn't quite come off.Barred by their sexuality from 
mainstream society, Mordden's men are forced to establish their own 
metropolitan counterculture. Carey's characters isolate themselves through 
their blind devotion to whatever is hot, hip or chic. A wittier writer might 
have made these recherche New Yorkers more amusing and less vapid, but Carey's 
pedestrian descriptions merely demonstrate how parochial the inhabitants of a 
major city can be.

 AMERICA BY THE NUMBERS: Facts and Figures From the Weighty to the Way-Out by 
Les Krantz (Houghton-Mifflin: $10.95; 231 pp., illustrated, paperback 
original). Krantz's quirky compilation of statistics offers an intriguing 
portrait of the nation. An estimated 41 million Americans have had cosmetic 
surgery (breast augmentation for women is the most common operation); 61% of 
the adult population was married in 1991 versus 72% in 1970; African Americans 
are the least likely to wed -- 37.1% had never been married in 1991. 
Interesting, but the reader should bear in mind that not everything can be 
quantified.

ASSASSINATION WITHOUT END; GERALD POSNER TAKES ISSUE WITH THE REVIEW OF HIS 
BOOK "CASE CLOSED," WHICH SAYS WE ALL COULD HAVE RESTED WITH THE WARREN 
COMMISSION REPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jonathan Kwitny's review of my book "Case Closed: Lee Harvey Oswald and the 
Assassination of JFK" (Book Review, Nov. 7) is filled with misrepresentations 
of both the record and my book. 
</P>
<P>
 It is curious that the Times selected Kwitny to review a book concluding that 
Oswald acted alone. He had already prejudged the assassination to be a Mafia 
conspiracy in his 1988 PBS special, and in the review, he charges that to 
espouse that the Warren Commission was right all along is the "looniest JFK 
assassination theory of all." 
</P>
<P>
 Kwitny reveals his bias in a number of ways. 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- Consider his attitude to the new technologies which have been applied to 
the Zapruder film, the so-called home movie of the assassination. These 
techniques help to resolve the precise questions of the number of shots fired 
at Dealey Plaza, the timing of the shots, and whether a single bullet inflicted 
seven of the wounds to President Kennedy and Governor Connally. This work, 
presented in "Case Closed," has been acknowledged in numerous reviews as a 
breakthrough on the case. Kwitny's entire discussion on the point is a 
sarcastic "Yeah." This is frivolous. 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- Kwitny is misleading through selectivity. He is upset that I do not 
credit the testimony of Edward Becker, who casually knew New Orleans godfather 
Carlos Marcello. Becker claimed that in 1962 Marcello confided to him some 
details of a plot to kill JFK. Kwitny says that he interviewed Becker and found 
his story "completely believable." He never informs the reader that the reason 
the House Select Committee on Assassinations rejected Becker's claim was 
because of his "questionable reputation for honesty and (he) may not be a 
credible source of information." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the Committee concluded that "it is unlikely that an organized crime 
leader personally involved in an assassination plot would discuss it with 
anyone other than his closest lieutenants . . ." Becker claimed Marcello told 
him about the plot to kill JFK, at their first business meeting. The fact that 
Kwitny believes this discredited tale again underscores his strong prejudgment 
in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- Kwitny says that I am incorrect in charging that the House Select 
Committee on Assassinations was prepared to conclude that a lone assassin had 
killed JFK until a last-second flip-flop caused by the mistaken acoustical 
conclusion that a police dictabelt contained the sounds of four, not three, 
shots. Instead, Kwitny says the House Committee planned months earlier to 
determine there was a likely mob conspiracy in the assassination. He ignores 
the statement of Rep. Edgar, on page 495 of the Select Committee Report, that: 
"I agree with the Dec. 13, 1978 first draft of our final report which states . 
. . that the available scientific evidence is insufficient to find that there 
was a conspiracy to assassinate President Kennedy. Up to that moment in the 
life of the committee we were prepared to go to the American people with this 
conclusion." Based on its last-minute acoustical evidence, the Committee 
scuttled its own 600-page draft which concluded no conspiracy, and issued a 
nine-page summary saying there likely was one. The final report was not issued 
until the following year. 
</P>
<P>
 4 -- Kwitny charges that I "am most misleading in claiming that Ruby was an 
underworld nobody." He then proceeds to pass along statements from 
uncorroborated FBI intelligence files to the effect that Ruby was involved in 
narcotics trafficking and had ties to leading mobsters. Kwitny himself claims 
that Ruby was taken before the Kefauver investigation in 1950 (implying that he 
was a more prominent mobster than I indicate), yet that is based on the 
unverified claim of a single source, and there is no corroborating evidence 
that Ruby was ever before the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this, in any event, is relevant to the issue. Ruby could have been the 
godfather of one of the largest Mafia families in America, and that has nothing 
to do with why he killed Oswald. Kwitny may want to debate the issue on the 
extent of Ruby's mob connections, but that does not prove a conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 5 -- Kwitny also distorts the record regarding Oswald's supposed ties to 
Carlos Marcello. He greatly overplays the role and influence of Oswald's uncle 
Dutz Murret, a local gambler. There is not a shred of credible evidence that 
indicates that Murret introduced his nephew to any mobster in New Orleans. 
Moreover, Kwitny relies on a photo of Ferrie and Oswald, when Oswald was a 
15-year-old member of the Civil Air Patrol in New Orleans, to suggest that the 
two later had a relationship to crime boss Carlos Marcello. Even if the photo 
of Oswald and Ferrie is finally tested and proven not to be a fake (as two 
other Oswald-Ferrie photos from the Garrison investigation were unmasked as 
composites) there still is not an iota of credible evidence that show the two 
men had any connection some eight years later, in the summer of 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 6 -- When discussing an episode in Clinton, La., where six witnesses later 
claimed to have seen Oswald together with Ferrie, Kwitny says "I only cite 
discrepancies" in their statements. The reader might think these were normal 
disagreements among witnesses, but they are much more than that. I uncovered 
previously missing documents from New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison's 
late 1960s probe into the assassination which highlight serious 
inconsistencies. 
</P>
<P>
 In the final analysis, historians will deem what appropriate credit "Case 
Closed" deserves in helping to resolve the outstanding questions in the 
assassination of JFK. Whatever that eventual resolution, Kwitny's distortions 
should not be allowed to stand uncorrected. 
</P>
<P>
 GERALD POSNER, NEW YORK CITY Jonathan Kwitny replies:  
</P>
<P>
 Posner's letter confirms my original point: while posing as a fair reporter, 
he is really still a lawyer, picking only those details that support his case, 
and withholding from the reader -- often unscrupulously -- those that don't. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only was my reference to the Warren Commission solution as "loony" 
obviously a joke, in a surfeit of care I actually labeled it in print as a 
joke, which shows Posner's unscrupulousness. 
</P>
<P>
 About Becker, Posner supplies two quotes that, while accurate, are in a 
misrepresentative context. Despite Becker's shady background, his account -- 
not of a plot but of an intent -- was circumstantially corroborated: House 
Committee Chief Counsel, Notre Dame Law Prof. G. Robert Blakey, says so in his 
own book. 
</P>
<P>
 Posner's whole point number 3 hangs on the word "scientific." As I wrote, in 
as much detail as a reviewer can, even now there isn't enough scientific 
evidence to resolve this; in the JFK case, scientists with abundant credentials 
still view the same evidence and endorse contradictory conclusions (reference 
also Posner's point number 1). 
</P>
<P>
 But more than six months before the scientific argument erupted, the House 
Committee staff made a powerful case that Marcello plotted the assassination; 
they based the case on records of proven telephone and travel contacts between 
Ruby and the Marcello organization, and strong evidence that Oswald had links 
to the organization (which Posner's book ducks). Whole books, not one 
unverified claim, detail Ruby's Mafia history. When Posner denies that the 
committee suspected Marcello before the questionable scientific evidence 
surfaced, he deceives the reader; I was there. 
</P>
<P>
 Posner hides the fact that his featured sources on Ruby (one of whom he won't 
disclose was a Las Vegas casino executive) are admitted liars about the case; 
for suspicious reasons, they concocted phon y stories that deflected suspicion 
from Ruby and Marcello. Before Posner's letter, my review stated that this 
didn't prove a conspiracy in the JFK assassination; but it does prove that 
Posner writes misleadingly. 
</P>
<P>
 My PBS programs on the assassination concludes that "a preponderance of the 
evidence" points to a Marcello hit. But because of so many continuing 
uncertainties, my programs didn't, and I can't, judge the case with nearly the 
finality that Posner does. My job as reviewer was to let the reader know that 
despite Posner's support from people with a vested stake in the Warren 
Commission findings, Posner's book was a one-sided lawyer's brief, and not a 
fair account. Among other readers' responses to the review of "Case Closed":  
</P>
<P>
 It is coincidence, I suppose, that the Book Review gives us reviews of two 
more books on the J.F.K. assassination in the same issue as a review of Dear 
Abby's collection of letters "Where Were You When (Kennedy Was Assassinated) . 
. . "? 
</P>
<P>
 From that day, 30 years ago, when I blindly left my house and walked, 
bewildered . . . I have believed everything and nothing. It does not help me, 
nor would I by now recognize it, to know the truth about lies about liars. 
</P>
<P>
 I am sure of only one thing: that nothing has been done or written in pure, 
disinterested search of the truth. The maze has been turned back on itself and 
there is no exit. Let me alone. I am used to my grief now, and it is enough. 
Let the self-appointed guides wander and wonder. It has long since become a 
business, an industry, at its shameful best, a hobby.

WHERE IS THIS NATIVE SON? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Imagine my dismay when I picked up the Los Angeles Times Book Review on 
Sunday, Dec. 5, 1993, and turned to Page 4 where I read "Buildings With 
Beautiful Bodies, Books With Lovely Limbs" by William Gass. At last, I thought, 
there will be recognition of Los Angeles' own native son who contributed a 
great deal to the architectural landscape of this area, Paul Revere Williams. 
NOT! There wasn't even a mention of "Paul R. Williams, Architect; Legacy of 
Style" by Karen E. Hudson, his granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only in an ad by Southern California's Booksellers that the book was 
mentioned at all on Page 39. 
</P>
<P>
 To quote the ad, "From the 1920s through the 1970s, Paul R. Williams designed 
over 3,000 projects, including the Beverly Hills and the Ambassador hotels and 
mansions for the stars. Here is the first documentation of one of Los Angeles' 
most important architects. Rizzoli (0-8478-1763-6), $50." The emphasis is my 
own. 
</P>
<P>
 I just want you to know that I know how you continue to degrade our images. 
Even the good, bright and brilliant are not to be recognized.

 JOYCE SUMBI, LOS ANGELES A SHORT-LIVED ENTERPRISE? 
</P>
<P>
 I was surprised and pleased to see the publication of African-American 
bestsellers (Nov. 28). However, given the vitriolic response it generated 
(Letters, Dec. 19), I fear it will be a short-lived enterprise. Ironically, the 
very intensity of the reactions the list provoked is indicative of the unique 
position African-American culture occupies in this country. I doubt very 
seriously that you would have gotten such passionate letters had you printed 
any other classification of bestsellers. 
</P>
<P>
 However, dear editor, I did want to let you know that your efforts were very 
much appreciated and that they were not lost on all of your readers -- 
especially this one.

 ELEANOR BROWN, LOS ANGELES SARTRE'S SAINTLY SINNER 
</P>
<P>
 In a very peculiar review of Edmund White's "Genet" (Nov. 21, 1993), Daniel 
Harris seems to conclude from a catalogue of the various ways in which Genet 
was a very, very bad boy, indeed, an "out and out scoundrel," that Genet was 
not a very good writer. The fact that he was an extraordinary and quite 
original stylist shows instead that there is something very wrong with the 
comfortable- sour-liberal-homophobic-Harper's magazine-moral order that the 
reviewer clearly feels he must defend. For in that order Genet is simply not 
possible. Sartre long ago defended a similar thesis in his "Saint Genet." The 
reviewer might have avoided trivializing his own moral and aesthetic position 
by paying some attention to Sartre's discussion.

 For a biographical history of American commercial TV and that of Screen Gems'

STYLE; GARDENS; A WESTERN WONDERLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDITH SIMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's winter in Southern California, and as the sun settles low on the horizon, 
the afternoon light illuminates the surrounding hills like a Courbet painting. 
The days are shorter and cooler; smoke curls out of chimneys. In the East, 
people are turning up the heat and shoveling snow, but here in Echo Park, I'm 
heading for my garden. 
</P>
<P>
 You can have your beaches and your endless sun-drenched pool parties. To me, 
the special perk, the real reason to live in Los Angeles, is winter. Sure, 
spring brings balmy days and a flower frenzy, but when it comes to putting 
vegetables on the table, winter -- our winter -- is my idea of a wonderland. 
</P>
<P>
 When I first started gardening 20 years ago, my winter vegetable plot was a 
poor, limited thing. Today, though, the number of cool-season seeds and plants 
increases every year, thanks to the Asian and European varieties available in 
stores and through catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
 My garden isn't huge. I have 10 raised beds constructed of 2-by-10-inch cedar 
planks. Two beds are only 3 by 4 feet; one, 5 by 6; the rest, in between. Each 
year, I plant mustards and cabbages and infinite variations on leafy greens, 
which are easy to grow and gratifyingly healthy. And they're beautiful: the 
lovely dark-green bok choy rosette called tatsoi; small mounds of pale or 
red-tipped butterhead lettuce; graceful fountains of mustards and kales; lacy 
heaps of frisee endive and mizuna. 
</P>
<P>
 I set out a few things in late September and manage a few salads before winter 
settles in, but my favorite time to plant is early January. Vegetables started 
now grow faster than those hanging around since fall, getting the benefit of 
longer days and the magical February rains. In January, I plant the quick crops 
-- Asian greens, escarole, lettuce, root vegetables -- and I'm feasting on 
cress, radishes, baby turnips, arugula and other greens shortly after 
Valentine's Day. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm a lazy gardener, which is another reason I appreciate winter. Fewer weeds, 
fewer bugs, less watering, less mulching. I wander through the garden in the 
morning, checking for insects, then I breeze through again in the evening, when 
I pick dinner, sometimes by flashlight. 
</P>
<P>
 Winter here is a time for cabbage relatives -- cauliflower, broccoli (and its 
first cousins, broccoli raab and romanesco), Brussels sprouts, kohlrabi, 
collards. For variety and aesthetics, I interplant, meaning I never put only 
one kind of plant in a raised bed. I might have celery next to fava beans and 
turnips, with onions, garlic or shallots snuggling up to beets, carrots and 
lettuce. Leeks are easy to tuck along the edges, as are those salad essentials, 
arugula, mache and cress. Among herbs, winter is the best season for cilantro, 
chervil and dill. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to bok choy, I have many favorites. Joi Choi, a hybrid bok choy, 
doesn't leap to seed at the first warm breeze, and the adorable Mei Qing Choi, 
a baby bok choy, remains infant-size no matter how long I ignore it. Kale is an 
assertive presence, which is one way of saying it can grow four feet tall. 
Packed with vitamins and reliable as the tide, it earns every inch of space I 
give it. Besides the glorious red Russian kale and the odd-looking, blue-leaved 
Italian lacinato, I plant many of those familiar green curly-leaf varieties 
that show up as garnish on restaurant plates but deserve to be the main event. 
</P>
<P>
 Lettuces are well-behaved: They don't ramble or tumble or invade another 
plant's space. They just sit there and steadily replace all the leaves I pick 
for salads. Lettuces now come in a variety of shapes, sizes and colors, 
including heirlooms and hybrids, romaines, butterheads and leaf varieties 
(don't bother with the iceberg types -- too much fuss, not enough flavor). 
</P>
<P>
 Although cabbages can be difficult, they are worth trying because the 
selection is so limited in local supermarkets. The array of cabbage seeds is 
bewildering: early ones, late ones, mid-seasons, flat tops, pointed heads, red 
heads and Savoys. With their crinkled deep-green leaves, Savoys are the prize, 
but just try to find them at the store. For that matter, try to find them at a 
farmers' market.  
</P>
<P>
 The chicory family is a reliable favorite. Radicchio is the most famous in 
these parts, and there are finally varieties that don't have to be pampered to 
attain their maximum red color. Belgian endive is still dismayingly 
labor-intensive, but with such sweet rewards: Grown as a green, it looks a bit 
like a dandelion all summer. The leaves are cut back in winter, the roots dug 
up and replanted in sand, tucked away in a dark cellar or closet, and -- voila! 
-- in a couple of weeks, pale yellow, slightly bitter leaf spears called 
chicons emerge; these are the $5-a-pound delicacy found at the best produce 
departments and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Plain and curly chicories are a lot less maintenance; they resemble lettuce, 
but they have the added complexity of a mild bitterness and a slightly crunchy 
texture. Plain old escarole doesn't look like much, but in soups, frittatas and 
stews, it justifies all the garden space it receives. The fanciest endive is 
curly frisee, a frilly little thing that makes even the dullest salad look 
chic. Another reason I love chicories: I have never seen a bug on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Many winter vegetables are available at nurseries in six-packs or four-inch 
pots, but I've found that several of these beauties don't like transplanting. 
Instead, I grow them from seed exactly where I want them in the garden. Bok 
choy and kohlrabi perform best if direct-seeded into the ground; same goes for 
cilantro and all the root crops. While I'm at it, I always direct-seed 
nasturtium and calendula flowers, both delicious in salads. 
</P>
<P>
 Winter gardening is not always a thrilling experience. I confess that I've had 
failures. Although many gardening friends do very well with them in this 
climate, I've given up on peas and spinach. And I must mention two 
disadvantages to a winter garden, both pests: imported cabbage worms and 
cabbage aphids. Since I don't use chemical sprays, I've found that the worms 
are easily controlled with a Bacillus thuringiensis (BT) spray, a natural 
control sold under various brand names, such as Dipel. Whether spraying or 
hand-picking, I've learned never to let my guard down. The worms, which are the 
caterpillar stage of a white butterfly, can devour most of a young cabbage 
(their target of choice) in one day. Even worse are the aphids. When I first 
started my winter-gardening career, I discovered masses of gray dots inside the 
cabbage heads and clustered on the undersides of the leaves. Although aphids 
don't eat a plant, they sap its energy and stall its growth. So I blasted away 
with the water hose, which seemed to help, but only for a day or two. Suddenly, 
huge numbers regrouped and attacked overnight. I mixed up the only organic 
aphid control that I know of, Safer Insecticidal Soap, and "cleansed" the 
aphids. Unfortunately, their relatives appeared two days later. 
</P>
<P>
 Interplanting cabbages with aromatic herbs such as rue seems to confuse the 
butterflies and aphids, but it doesn't defeat them. After a few years of 
frustration, I abandoned aesthetics altogether. Now, as soon as my cabbage 
plants are in the ground, I erect hoops over them and drape the hoops with a 
lightweight, semitransparent covering, such as Reemay or Agronet, securing all 
edges. These shrouds are not pretty, but they are effective. 
</P>
<P>
 So, you ask, is it worth the time and effort? How much can I really get out of 
my back-yard vegetable plot? A lot . My Sussex trug overflows with varicolored 
lettuces. My big, ugly green wire basket, purchased from Burpee about 20 years 
ago, bulges with greens. Pounds and pounds of produce, all organic, all 
dirt-cheap. Picking it is almost as much fun as eating it. 
</P>
<P>
 So, while my relatives in Brooklyn and Kansas City are still staring gloomily 
at snow and sleet and frozen ground, wondering if spring will ever spring, I'm 
outdoors in a T-shirt, caressing my collards. I savor every minute of this 
because it goes by so quickly. After all, next month I have to start thinking 
about . . . tomatoes.

 When artist-photographer Steven Arnold moved from his large Downtown loft to a 
West Hollywood cottage last year, he faced two major challenges: to give the 
anonymous, postwar house a sense of style and to maintain his pleasure-palace 
aesthetic in a relatively small space. He enlisted the help of a friend, 
Hollywood-based interior designer Vincent Jacquart, to bring the new space 
"polish, detail and elegance." With the simple addition of paint and fabric, 
and inspiration from Jean Cocteau and Salvador Dali, Jacquart quickly and 
inexpensively made the transformation. 
</P>
<P>
 For Arnold, color is essential, and more is better. The first step, Jacquart 
says, was selecting a "spiritual" shade of saffron paint, inspired by a 
Buddhist priest's hand-dyed robe. The brilliant color provides a bright 
background for Arnold's own jewel-like oil paintings; it unifies other colors 
and materials -- gold, cinnabar, malachite, mother of pearl, coral and crystal 
-- found throughout the house. Jacquart chose an "extremely practical" 
leopard-print carpet for Arnold, who entertains frequently and wanted something 
that would camouflage stains. The bathroom is a shocking pink, inspired by 
Schiaparelli. Coral and Tiffany blue were used as accents in the bedroom and 
dining room. 
</P>
<P>
 During his 15 years in his loft studio, Arnold, a relentless and unapologetic 
collector, had amassed an abundance of dime-store tchotchkes as well as 
Venetian antiques. Jacquart culled the best pieces, including curvaceous 
mirror-image sofas designed by Dali for Gump's in San Francisco in the '30s 
(especially valuable to Arnold, who was a Dali protege ). Then he arranged the 
treasures to re-create the old studio's dramatic perspective. The secret? "It's 
a twist on scale," says the designer, who playfully assembled the tiny with the 
great. To wit: a pair of gilded Louis XVI children's chairs placed 
conversation-close to the restored and reupholstered sofas in the living room. 
</P>
<P>
 Reliquaries and figurines of saints, bodhisattvas and gods decorate every 
corner of Arnold's home. "It's all a shrine," the artist says, whether to Kuan 
Yin, St. Francis of Assisi or Diana Vreeland, his patron saint of style. This 
all-embracing attitude -- and love of the absurd -- makes the space special; 
everything, from the precious to the ridiculous, becomes exalted. "Really," 
says Arnold, "we giggled the whole time we decorated."LESA SAWAHATA

FILM COMMENT; WHY I HATED 'PHILADELPHIA'; A PLAYWRIGHT AND GAY ACTIVIST GOES TO 
SEE HOLLYWOOD'S FIRST MAJOR AIDS MOVIE AND COMES AWAY BITTERLY DISAPPOINTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY KRAMER, Larry Kramer, a former Columbia Pictures executive, is the 
author of Reports From the Holocaust: The Making of an AIDS Activist (St. 
Martin's Press) and two plays about AIDS, The Normal Heart and The Destiny of 
Me. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Philadelphia" is a heartbreakingly mediocre film. It's dishonest, it's often 
legally, medically and politically inaccurate, and it breaks my heart that I 
must say it's simply not good enough and I'd rather people not see it at all. 
</P>
<P>
 For 12 years, millions of people -- gays, people with AIDS, people infected 
with HIV, their families and friends -- have been waiting desperately for a 
"major" movie to deal with this plague in a mature fashion. Other tragedies, 
from the Holocaust to Vietnam to Watergate, have had their films. Why not AIDS? 
Oh, we knew why not: Because AIDS is happening to certain communities others 
would just as soon see dead. There's no audience, we've been told, for this 
kind of subject; so for the 12 years of this plague, Hollywood has turned its 
back on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally a company called TriStar, which is a division of Columbia Pictures, 
which is a division of Sony Entertainment, which is a division of Japan, where 
there are very few AIDS cases, has given us "Philadelphia." Not only has it 
given us "Philadelphia," but it, and everyone else in Hollywood, has let us all 
know that if "Philadelphia" isn't a success, there just might not be any other 
films about AIDS. In other words, like Clinton's new gays-in-the-military 
policy, to fight for our welfare we go to this movie but we're not supposed to 
tell anyone how awful it is. We're supposed to be grateful it's been made.  
</P>
<P>
 But "Philadelphia" doesn't have anything to do with the AIDS I know, or with 
the gay world I know. It doesn't bear any truthful resemblance to the life, 
world and universe I live in. To believe any viewer -- particularly those I 
would like to have experience something meaningful watching this movie -- would 
change his or her point of view after seeing it is like thinking Jesse Helms or 
George Bush would change after watching an episode of "Another World." 
</P>
<P>
 "Philadelphia" is put together like a by-the-numbers painting: 
</P>
<P>
 Take one noble gay white male hero (Tom Hanks). Put him together with one 
black ambulance-chasing lawyer who hates gays (Denzel Washington). Pepper their 
conflict with the (most improbable) notion that the shyster is the only lawyer 
in the entire city of Philadelphia who will defend the white man, who's been 
fired from his law firm on obviously trumped-up grounds of poor work 
performance. (The audience knows it's really because he has AIDS.) Make the 
head honchos in the white law firm (senior partner: Jason Robards) so monstrous 
and homophobic you wonder how they've stayed in business so long. Have a 
despicable white woman (Mary Steenburgen) and another black lawyer defend the 
law firm. By trial's end, make certain the black shyster has experienced a 
change of heart so he can deliver a rending closing speech on discrimination 
and the white woman can mutter, "I hate this case." And our hero, who's just 
collapsed on the floor, can win some $30 million on his deathbed. 
</P>
<P>
 It's so patently illegal to fire a person with AIDS that the very notion that 
a Main Line law firm would fire this guy is ludicrously unbelievable. Who was 
the legal adviser on this movie? Did no one know of the Americans With 
Disabilities Act, which categorically prohibits such a dismissal? 
</P>
<P>
 There's another credibility problem: Washington never really makes us believe 
he's as slimy as the script is telling us he is. His character does so many 
flip-flops I wondered whether they'd shot two versions and intercut them. One 
scene he's railing against gays; the next scene, he's defending them; then he's 
slugging a gay athlete who tries to pick him up; then he's waffling with his 
wife about the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The screenwriter may have meant Robards, Steenburgen and Washington all to be 
scumbags, but at least their parts are written. They're more animated than 
anybody gay in the movie. Hanks, his lover and his mother are in a silent film. 
All their dialogue put together couldn't cover 10 pages. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanks' character is an utter cipher. I couldn't tell you anything about him -- 
opinions, beliefs or even whether he's gay. Tom Hanks does not act in this 
movie. His makeup does his acting. I haven't seen so many changes hinged on 
shades of Max Factor since James Cagney in "Man of a Thousand Faces." 
</P>
<P>
 We see that Hanks wears a wedding ring, but who is his mate? He might as well 
be married to a woman. Some actor I couldn't recognize from one scene to the 
next but who had dark hair and spoke with a Spanish accent hovers around Tom 
now and then, and Tom winks at him in the courtroom, but for all the script 
tells you, they could be trying to pick each other up or the guy could be a 
volunteer from an AIDS organization. No -- I take that back. The dark-haired 
guy couldn't work for an AIDS organization: He doesn't know anything about 
AIDS. He talks about a colonoscopy as if it were brain surgery. Who was the 
medical adviser on this movie? 
</P>
<P>
 Two "big" scenes are meant to convey we're in the company of "different" 
people. The first involves Tom listening to Maria Callas sing an obscure aria 
about the French Revolution from "Andrea Chenier." To see this character, who's 
been totally undeveloped by the screenwriter, suddenly -- in front of Denzel -- 
put on Maria and, in swooping close-ups a la Fellini, swirl and swoon around a 
dim room (his apartment? loft? house? as I say, it's dim), his eyes rolling in 
ecstasy -- this is not acting, it's embarrassing. I'd be afraid of someone too 
if -- out of the blue -- he behaved like this. 
</P>
<P>
 The other scene is a gay party, which I guess is an obligatory scene in a 
movie about gay people. Quentin Crisp can be briefly glimpsed; what Quentin 
Crisp, perhaps one of the most outrageous homosexuals in the world, is doing at 
this party and with these people is a question I'll bet even he can't answer. 
There is a shot of one of our greatest AIDS activist heroes, Michael Callen 
(who died the day I saw this movie), performing, with the Flirtations, "Mr. 
Sandman" (they must have known that boring trial scene lay just ahead). Tom and 
his companion are dressed like naval officers. Tom dances with his lover as if 
he were his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings me to his mother, and the rest of his family. Every single one of 
them is supportive, thrilled he's gay, and rooting for Tom at the trial. The 
movie's single most awful moment comes when Tom gushes to these assembled 
relations -- after warning them that bad things might come out about his 
private life (he once went, horror of horrors, to the baths and a gay porno 
theater) and learning that, surprise, they are with him 100% -- "Gosh, I love 
you guys." As Dorothy Parker once wrote, "Tontstant Weader fwowed up." 
</P>
<P>
 Who's going to see a movie like this? Why don't the filmmakers understand that 
it's lies and distortions that make the "Middle America" they pander to and are 
so terrified of offending stay away in droves? A 6-year-old -- after five years 
of going to the mall and watching countless TV shows that handle this subject 
better -- knows gay people don't live and look and act like this. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm tired of hearing the old chestnut that the reason Hollywood doesn't 
finance movies about gays and AIDS is that they won't make money. 
("Philadelphia" will not make money.) I scream back: If you make an honest 
movie, people will come to it, and there's never been an honest movie financed 
by a major studio with gay or lesbian leading characters in which we're dealt 
with dramatically just as heterosexuals are! 
</P>
<P>
 I fervently believe that the first decent movie in which a male star like Tom 
Hanks makes love, in a bed, naked, with another male star, like Tom Cruise, in 
the same bed, also naked, and they embrace and they talk to each other in an 
adult fashion, doing the same things straight lovers do in every single movie, 
TV show and commercial, it will make a fortune.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings me to this movie's biggest lie. There is not one person in the 
entire world with AIDS or who is HIV-positive who does not believe he or she is 
the victim of governmental inaction and oversight of huge proportions. There is 
not one of us not forced to face the fact that Ronald Reagan, George Bush and 
Bill Clinton have done little to save our lives. For there not to be one 
reference in this entire movie to this is criminal. 
</P>
<P>
 What unreal world do the manufacturers of this movie live in? How can it be 
possible that a gay screenwriter wrote this cornucopia of lies?  
</P>
<P>
 Yes, I'm angry. I waited 12 years for this? Anyone who wants to see what gay 
life is really like and how audiences are reacting to it should go and see the 
seven hours of theater known as "Angels in America," which is selling out every 
performance on Broadway.  
</P>
<P>
 To watch director Jonathan Demme and screenwriter Ron Nyswaner on a recent 
"Nightline" -- trying to maintain that, well, gee, it's not really a movie 
about AIDS, and well, we wanted to make a movie Middle America would go and see 
-- is enough to make anyone lose faith in the artist as the teller of truth. 
Why did they make it, then? I bring up the painful reminder that Demme also 
directed "The Silence of the Lambs," which many gays consider one of the most 
virulently and insidiously homophobic films ever made. Is "Philadelphia" some 
sort of attempt on his part to offer an apology? After these two films, I wish 
he'd just go away and leave us alone. He's about as good for our cause as 
Reagan, Bush or Clinton.  
</P>
<P>
 In the end, though, my rage isn't against Demme and Nyswaner. They're only 
small potatoes who've missed a boat that could have carried some valuable 
cargo. My fury is against the third silent President in a row who refuses to 
take a leadership position in ending this plague, thus allowing everyone else's 
complicities in a monstrous cover-up that not only allows one lousy AIDS movie 
to be made in 12 years, but by the same token allows an entire world to look 
the other way.

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: . . . AS DOES DREAM 
PROJECT ABOUT A HOMELESS WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lars Eighner's movie isn't the only one focusing on a homeless protagonist. 
Angela de Joseph, a Los Angeles City College film student and former TV fashion 
reporter, has made a 20-minute film about a homeless woman who finds a beauty 
make-over coupon in the garbage, and she's garnered the attention of Oprah 
Winfrey, producer Kathleen Kennedy and KCET-TV.  
</P>
<P>
 Titled "It's in the Bag," the film is De Joseph's '90s twist on being down and 
out in Beverly Hills, which she hopes to screen at the Directors Guild next 
month. "It's in the Bag" focuses on a homeless woman who tries to redeem a 
coupon at a ritzy Beverly Hills salon. She and those around her are transformed 
spiritually -- and, in her case, physically. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to make a film about women, using women, because I think women are 
some of the most underappreciated talent in Hollywood," De Joseph says.  
</P>
<P>
 After stints as an editor (at Essence) and in public relations in Chicago, De 
Joseph became a reporter on KABC-TV's "AM Los Angeles." The show's beauty 
make-overs gave her the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 With only $7,000 of her own to work with, De Joseph turned to groups like 
Cinewomen for help. "I was looking for volunteers, people to work for free, 
honestly," she says. But the pros who volunteered were used to the best 
equipment, and she had to come up with enough money to accommodate three days 
of shooting.  
</P>
<P>
 De Joseph was undaunted and finally approached both Winfrey and Kennedy for 
help after unanticipated costs surfaced. Both women confirmed their 
contributions, but declined to disclose the amount. 
</P>
<P>
 The film stars Iona Morris of ABC's "Where I Live" and CBS' "As the World 
Turns."  
</P>
<P>
 De Joseph and Shirley Gibson, who runs the Good Shepherd shelter in Silver 
Lake, are the focus of a KCET documentary, "Making Lives Over," airing Feb. 23, 
in which beauty make-overs are done on women at the shelter.

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: THE UNIFORM OF THE DAY: A 
DRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Robin Williams has perpetuated one of the biggest jokes of the movie season. 
Audiences find his silly antics, parading around in women's clothes and 
speaking with a falsetto British accent in "Mrs. Doubtfire" pretty funny -- as 
$122.4 million in box-office receipts (and counting) proves. 
</P>
<P>
 So naturally Hollywood can be expected to follow suit in a big way -- except 
that the collection of upcoming cross-dressing films push the "Doubtfire" 
concept much further: The cross-dressers flouncing upon the screen over the 
next couple of years won't be heterosexual males trapped in the bodice of a 
woman, but bona fide transvestites -- and gay. 
</P>
<P>
 Actor-playwright Harvey Fierstein, who in fact played Williams' makeup-artist 
brother in "Mrs. Doubtfire," has penned a script for Dolly Parton's Sandollar 
Productions titled "Plucked," which follows the trials of a drag queen forced 
to play surrogate father to his sister's children after she abandons them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time has come to explore gay issues in the movies," said Carol Baum, 
production president for Sandollar. "It's the one area that hasn't been tackled 
from every angle yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Independent producer Howard Rosenman ("Father of the Bride") has acquired the 
rights to drag queen Holly Woodlawn's 1991 autobiography, "A Low Life in High 
Heels." Woodlawn, a former Andy Warhol superstar and one of the subjects Lou 
Reed sang about in "Walk on the Wild Side," went from the celebrity-studded 
Studio 54 drugs-and-alcohol lifestyle during the '70s to studying party dress 
design at Los Angeles' Fashion Institute of Design and Merchandising (and 
otherwise living a much quieter, sober existence). 
</P>
<P>
 And Spielberg's Amblin Entertainment recently conducted drag queen auditions 
for New York playwright Doug Beane's screenplay of "To Wong Foo, Thanks for 
Everything, Julie Newmar," the story of three drag queens -- one of whom 
worships TV's Catwoman, Julie Newmar -- and their escapades through the South. 
The movie's title refers to an inscription made to a Chinese restaurant owner 
on a photo, in the possession of one of the queens who places it on the car 
dashboard as a talisman. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the finished Australian comedy acquired by Polygram, "The 
Adventures of Priscilla, Queen of the Desert," awaiting a domestic theatrical 
release. Starring Terence Stamp, Hugo Weaving and Guy Pearce, the picture is 
described as a road movie about three drag queens who travel the outback in a 
beat-up bus called Priscilla.

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: DOGGED DUMPSTER DIGGING 
PAYS OFF . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEIGH HOPPER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last summer, he was scavenging for provisions in dumpsters. Today, Lars 
Eighner is an acclaimed writer, with a feature film in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 The pitch: Homeless man discovers severed head in dumpster and works to solve 
the case. It's got an irresistible hook but Eighner's screenplay-in-progress 
pales in comparison to the real-life twists and turns of the writer's own tale. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighner, 45, of Austin, Tex., is the formerly homeless author of "Travels With 
Lizbeth," which was published in October by St. Martin's Press. Now in its 
seventh printing, thanks to a windfall of positive press and the sheer power of 
Eighner's prose, the book was named recently by the New York Times Book Review 
as one of the top books of 1993. It is a beautifully written account of the 
three years Eighner spent living under a shower curtain, sleeping beneath 
bridges and eating garbage in Austin and Southern California, accompanied by 
his Labrador-mix mutt, Lizbeth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not undertake to write about homelessness but wrote what I knew, as an 
artist paints a still life, not because he is especially fond of fruit, but 
because the subject is readily at hand," he says in the introduction to 
"Travels With Lizbeth." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Eighner flew to New York to meet director David Van Taylor (the 
1992 documentary "Dream Deceivers") and begin scouting locations and writing a 
screen treatment.  
</P>
<P>
 The film will feature an Eighner-like character on the streets of New York, 
someone who is "quirky, down-and-out . . . not a victim -- an intelligent, 
complex person in his own right," Van Taylor says.  
</P>
<P>
 This character will unravel a murder-mystery using skills he's acquired 
through homelessness -- the ability to decipher clues about people's lives from 
their garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 This spring, PBS will air Van Taylor's eight-minute video based on Eighner's 
eloquent essay, "On Dumpster Diving." Eighner -- all 6 feet, 3 inches, and 350 
pounds of him -- takes viewers on a narrated tour: "At first the new scavenger 
is filled with disgust and self-loathing . . . every grain of rice seems to be 
a maggot. Everything seems to stink. He can wipe the egg yolk off the found 
can, but he cannot erase from his mind the stigma of eating garbage." 
</P>
<P>
 But is Hollywood really ready for a homeless protagonist? Van Taylor thinks 
so. The recent "The Saint of Fort Washington," starring Matt Dillon as a 
homeless man, did poorly at the box office, but Van Taylor was nonetheless 
encouraged by Siskel and Ebert's reviews, which complained it wasn't "real 
enough," and "needed to be more like 'Travels With Lizbeth' by Lars Eighner." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, fame has whisked Eighner off the streets: A $10,000 advance from 
St. Martin's Press enabled Eighner and Lizbeth to move out of the abandoned bar 
where he finished the book and into a tiny efficiency apartment in Austin.  
</P>
<P>
 Eighner, who grew up in Houston, became homeless after walking out on his job 
at a mental hospital. He says the economic bust of the late '80s in Austin left 
him with few job options. He didn't have a college degree, and says he was 
"really too old to compete for the flipping-hamburger, student-type jobs. So 
there was nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 After getting behind on the rent and landing on the street, he began mailing 
dispatches from the road to author Steven Saylor, who is now Eighner's agent. 
As Saylor read Eighner's letters, "I was just bowled over by it." He told 
Eighner, "You're seeing things nobody else is seeing and you're a great 
writer." 
</P>
<P>
 Eighner wants to use his success to break into screenwriting beyond this one 
film, and Van Taylor is banking on Eighner's ability. Eighner admits to a fear 
of ending up homeless again. 
</P>
<P>
 "This kind of book is about as big a hit as it could be," he says. "But I'm 
not going to make all the money in the world off it. It's not the kind of book 
that lends itself to any sequels. Essentially, this could very easily be a 
flash in the pan.  
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to make hay while the sun shines."

RESTAURANTS; A MAN OF HIS WORD; AFTER CLOSING ONE RESTAURANT A YEAR AGO, LARRY 
NICOLA IS BACK -- AND COOKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Colman Andrews 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When a restaurateur, closing down his restaurant, vows, "I shall return," it's 
usually not a good idea to bet your next meal that he will. Everybody tries to 
bow out gracefully or bravely; not everybody has the stuffing (or the bucks) to 
come back. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Nicola, though, has made good on his promise. In August, 1992, when he 
shuttered his 13-year-old L.A. Nicola in Silver Lake, he announced that before 
long, he planned to open a casual, outdoor food-service facility and an 
upscale, indoor dining room -- both in the new Sanwa Bank Plaza at Wilshire 
Boulevard and Figueroa Street, Downtown. Lo and behold, that's exactly what he 
has done. He launched the Kiosk at Nicola -- a breakfast-through-quitting-time 
food stand serving pastries, sandwiches, tamales, salads and the like -- in 
May. In October, he debuted his new full-scale restaurant, called simply 
Nicola, adjacent to and spilling out into the building's atrium lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hardly the typical bank-building eatery. The interior was designed by 
architect Michael Rotondi; as part of the now-defunct Morphosis, he was also 
responsible for L.A. Nicola (and for 72 Market St., Kate Mantilini, etc.). 
Nicola is bold and a bit unsettling, though great fun to look at and slightly 
more comfortable than it appears. Outside, a curving banquette of seats -- 
constructed of xylophone-like metal slats, set into bases of granite boulders 
-- surrounds more chairs and tables like the ones inside. Overhead in one 
corner is a shape that suggests a fragment of a shattered astrolabe. It's all a 
bit jarring and hard-edged.  
</P>
<P>
 A similar boldness, but with plenty of attractively soft edges, characterizes 
the polyglot menu. Nicola himself is the chef, and he produces dishes with a 
sense of flavor that is pure and uncompromising, using spice, acidity, 
pungency, bitterness and salt in simple but not simple-minded combinations. 
</P>
<P>
 Appetizers are particularly diverse. A serving of ciabatta bread, roasted 
garlic, Greek-style olives and Iowa-bred Maytag Blue cheese is an abbreviated 
Mediterranean-rustic picnic on a plate. A similarly multinational offering, a 
charred pasilla chile stuffed with crisply sauteed bits of lamb and melting 
Port Salut cheese with tomatillo sauce beneath, has the feeling of an 
improvised refrigerator snack (if you've got a reasonably sophisticated 
refrigerator), with an appropriate comfort-food solidity to it. Squid, 
perfectly deep-fried in a bread-crumb crust, come with what looks like a 
conventional tomato salsa -- which happens to be accented, unexpectedly but 
agreeably, with the sourness of rice vinegar. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the best appetizer of all, though, is Nicola's classic version of the 
Lebanese steak tartare, kibbe. Made with ground lamb mixed with bulgur wheat, 
mildly sweet and aromatic, it is flavored hauntingly with cinnamon and 
allspice, topped with roasted pine nuts and served with triangles of pita, 
slices of raw onion and a little dish of coarse salt. The only real 
disappointments among the appetizers are a smoked-shrimp-and-leek soup, in 
whose otherwise delicious shellfish broth there floated about 3 1/2 minuscule 
shrimp and a dozen or so strips of blackened leek one evening, and a salad of 
mustard greens (too many), black-eyed peas (not enough) and corn-bread croutons 
(boring as old toast). 
</P>
<P>
 Main courses are, in general, less exotic -- but they are hardly predictable. 
A section of rice and noodle dishes, most available in either appetizer- or 
entree-sized portions, includes a wonderfully salty, almost smoky dish of 
pan-fried broad rice noodles with crisp bits of duck, sauteed bok choy and -- 
strange but true, and not bad at all -- cranberries. Meat and fish seem equally 
honored here. There's soul-satisfying grilled peppered rib eye with scalloped 
dill- flavored potatoes (truly memorable) or London broil, which is almost 
earthy-tasting skewered rounds of skirt steak with Gorgonzola sauce and roasted 
tomatoes on one hand. And on the other hand, pan-fried monkfish glistening in a 
rich and concentrated Chinese pepper sauce (made, that is, with  
</P>
<P>
 Sichuan pepper, which has a quality reminiscent of cloves and cedar) and moist 
but crisp-skinned whole New Zealand snapper with a sauce of soy, garlic and 
sake, served over vegetable fried rice. At lunchtime, there is an excellent 
oversized hamburger with first-rate fries, and an only-in-America sandwich of 
thin-sliced charred rare ahi tuna on challah bread with watercress and Japanese 
pickled ginger, accompanied by a small, cumin-scented black bean salad. Is this 
a great country or what ? 
</P>
<P>
 Desserts, from a frequently changing menu, seem less successful than most of 
the other dishes -- an almost chalky chocolate pudding cake, a pedestrian 
pumpkin cheesecake -- though there is sometimes a quite wonderful apple-rhubarb 
crisp served in a big white bowl with vanilla ice cream. 
</P>
<P>
 Service is crackerjack, and there are rolled small towels in the rest rooms. 
It sure is nice that Larry Nicola kept his word. 
</P>
<P>

THE WINE LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dan Berger 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Americans seem to love wine lists that are largely chocolate-and-vanilla 
(i.e., Cabernet Sauvignon and Chardonnay) affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet invariably, the best wines to go with food, especially the spice-rich food 
at Nicola, are wines other than these two varieties.The small wine list at 
Nicola has enough chocolate and vanilla items to make traditionalists happy and 
enough real wine (i.e., food wines) to make foodies purr. 
</P>
<P>
 Best bets for the sharply flavored appetizers here are 1992 Trefethen 
Riesling, $17, and 1990 Navarro Gewurztraminer, $18. For main dish fare, I'd 
try the assertive and distinctive 1991 Lucien Crochet Sancerre, designated "Le 
Chene," at $34, a bit steep but an excellent accompaniment to the food. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the red wines, the Pinot Noirs -- Saintsbury (1991 Garnet, $28), and 
1991 Zaca Mesa, $23, are both good choices. You also might like the superb 1991 
Havens Merlot, $25. 
</P>
<P>
 A unique feature to this list is an entire section (five wines) devoted to the 
wines of Bonny Doon, including the well-regarded Cigare Volant, $30. For some 
of the more richly flavored foods, try Bonny Doon's 1990 Big House Red, a kind 
of Rhone-Italian blend that at $16 is a best buy. 
</P>
<P>
 The list also has 1988 Ceretto Barolo, a massively constituted red wine best 
dealt with by saving it a decade more. I hope the wine is around then. I hope I 
am, too. Chances are, however, it won't be at today's price, $39. Oh, well, 
c'est le vin . Dan Berger

SOAP STAR WISHES AND RESOLUTIONS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Daytime's finest have high hopes and plenty of resolutions for this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Heather Tom, who plays Victoria Newman on "The Young and the Restless," wants 
"to get everything together in my life so I can start school (UCLA pre-law) 
with a fresh mind. I'm also going to start voice lessons and resume dance 
classes. Basically, I just plan to hone my craft and explore other facets of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Veronica Redd-Forrest (who plays Mamie Johnson on "The Young and the 
Restless") is determined to be a happier person. "Even though I have a 
wonderful life, I have a tendency sometimes to worry a lot. But I'm going to 
stop doing that and appreciate what I have." 
</P>
<P>
 Brenda Epperson (who plays Ashley Abbott on "The Young and the Restless") has 
plans galore for '94. "First of all, I want to be more committed to my New 
Year's resolutions than I have been in the past," she says, laughing. 
"Actually, I want to become more organized, get into a more regimented exercise 
program, learn how to play the piano, make another film and get my record album 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcy Walker (who plays Tangie Hill on "Guiding Light") plans "to slow down 
and appreciate things more. But it's not really a resolution, it's more of a 
promise. Promises are pacts, which are attainable. Resolutions, people never 
seem to attain." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Trachta (who plays Thorne Forrester on "The Bold and the Beautiful") 
vows: "I'm going to make sure I live every day to the fullest, like it's my 
last day. Life is very short, so you'd better enjoy it while it's here." 
</P>
<P>
 Anna Lee (who plays matriarch Lila Quartermaine on "General Hospital") says 
that she'll complete a project she's had on her agenda for years. "I'm 
definitely going to write my autobiography," she says. "I've been talking about 
this for so long, but it's been so difficult, because I've had quite a lot of 
work on 'General Hospital,' and I've also had things in my own private life 
that have needed attention. I'm going to make the time to do it this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Kanan (who plays A.J. Quartermaine, Anna Lee's on-screen grandson) has a 
similar goal in mind: "I really want to try to make more time for my writing. 
I'm currently working on a play that I hope to produce and star in this spring. 
I'm also writing a lot of material for a stand-up comedy act I'm developing." 
Kanan's other goal is "not to procrastinate." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Burton (who plays Jason Quartermaine on "General Hospital") notes: "I'm 
going to work as hard as I can to save as much money as possible, so that I can 
buy my own home this year. I'd like to get one with a guest house for my dad to 
live in." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Kelker Kelly (who plays Bo Brady on "Days of Our Lives") is going to 
"try to stop smoking -- again! Hopefully, it will happen this time," he says. 
"I tried last year. I even wore a nicotine patch for a while. I'm going to give 
that a try again." 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Brooks (Kelker Kelly's co-star who plays Peter Blake) jokes: "I'm going 
to continue what I've been doing -- washing the producers' cars." Then, on a 
serious note, he adds: "The only thing I would like to concentrate on is to get 
my work up to a level that's acceptable to me. I'm not at that point yet, but 
I'm going to get there."

STAGE WATCH: BILL BUSHNELL SAILS AWAY FROM 'CREATIVELY TOXIC' L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Bushnell is outta here. 
</P>
<P>
 The man who ran Los Angeles Theatre Center -- L.A.'s most important theater of 
the late '80s -- has moved to St. Croix, in the Virgin Islands, where he shares 
a sailboat, At Random, with his brother Jon, a university professor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could no longer ignore the reality that I couldn't breathe in L.A. without 
sucking on my asthma inhalers several times a day," Bushnell wrote in his 
holiday letter to friends and acquaintances. "AND (his emphasis), just as 
important, the City of Angels has become creatively toxic." 
</P>
<P>
 Bushnell elaborated on his thoughts in an interview. The only way to make a 
living in L.A. theater is by getting a staff job at the Mark Taper Forum, he 
contended. L.A. politicians and corporate leaders are no longer challenging 
L.A.'s artists to try something new, he said. "For better or worse, that 
existed in the '70s and '80s," but now, "the synergy is gone." 
</P>
<P>
 To spend millions on "Sunset Boulevard" is "highly questionable," Bushnell 
said, but even worse, he added, is the expenditure of much more money on such 
movies as "Last Action Hero." Furthermore, he argued, Actors' Equity's 99-Seat 
Theatre Plan, which allows equity members to work for only token wages, is 
"extremely shortsighted. It encourages bad showcase theater and keeps good 
theater from occurring." Elsewhere, where professional theaters are required to 
use full-fledged equity contracts, "you can find far more vital theater 
communities in cities 25% the size of L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Bushnell may eventually land in such a city. "I've got one more theater left 
in me," he said, noting that he helped develop three theaters so far -- Center 
Stage in Baltimore and American Conservatory Theater in San Francisco are the 
others. He wants his next to be "a modest-sized theater in a modest-sized city 
that really focuses on new writers." 
</P>
<P>
 In his holiday letter, he added that if he is smart, his next theater "will be 
affiliated with a larger institution that will worry about its physical and 
administrative infrastructure" -- the undertow that eventually sank LATC. 
Bushnell was hired by such an institution -- Cal State Long Beach -- after LATC 
died, and worked with its resident theater company, CalRep. But that job ended 
after only 20 months because of the financial squeeze on California's 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
 A legal entanglement lingers on for Bushnell in L.A. Soon after LATC collapsed 
in Oct. 1991, the state's Employment Development Department assessed him for 
$46,464 in LATC's unpaid unemployment and insurance contributions and slapped 
on an additional $6,607 penalty. But last Dec. 1, administrative law judge Paul 
Wyler reduced Bushnell's liability in the case to just those debts from the 
period between mid-May 1991 and the theater's final collapse -- an 80% 
reduction, according to Bushnell attorney Mark Rosenblatt's estimate. Wyler 
accepted the argument that Bushnell was not in charge of the theater's finances 
during the preceding period. 
</P>
<P>
 Bushnell and Rosenblatt have now appealed Wyler's finding that Bushnell acted 
willfully regarding the non-payment of the later debts. A decision from the 
Unemployment Insurance Appeals Board in Sacramento isn't expected for several 
months. Bushnell said he has defended himself "vigorously" in the case, "but a 
lot can be done by deposition and telephone" from his new home in St. Croix. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at the Theatre Center as a great success," said Bushnell. "I've never 
felt these places should necessarily be permanent." Regarding the municipally 
owned LATC building, now in use only for sporadic rentals: "Eventually somebody 
will figure out how to make it exciting." 
</P>

 ANOTHER "WALTZ": In last week's item about cast recordings, musical maven 
Miles Kreuger (whose name was regrettably misspelled) cited a cast album of the 
1965 California production of "The Great Waltz" as one of the few examples of a 
cast album from a production that never reached Broadway. However, a reader 
points out that an earlier version of "The Great Waltz" played New York 31 
years earlier, at the old Center Theatre in Rockefeller Center. The 
well-informed reader saw it in New York in 1934 and also saw the California 
revival.

ON THE RECORD: NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF NEGLECTED BACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HERBERT GLASS, Herbert Glass is a regular contributor to Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It might seem ridiculous to regard as neglected a composer who is one of the 
Three B's and whose discography fills more than 30 pages of the Schwann Opus 
catalogue, second only to Mozart. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, new recordings of music by Johann Sebastian Bach are hardly numerous, 
many of those Schwann pages being devoted to re-releases. 
</P>
<P>
 Papa Bach suffered even in the heady days of the Baroque Craze of the 1950s 
and '60s at the hands of Vivaldi, whose simpler, more visceral music was first 
being "discovered" by a mass audience. He has been subverted more recently by 
the worldwide appreciation of Handel ignited by his tricentennial in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Bach was regarded as conservative in his own time and is taken for granted 
today, his name being so familiar that it would seem not to need boosting. 
</P>
<P>
 In the area of Bach's cantatas, of which there are more than 200, help is 
particularly needed. Much of what the catalogue contains dates back a 
quarter-century: the Harnoncourt recordings, made at a time when the period 
movement was just beginning and its practitioners were sure neither of their 
instruments nor their stylistic parameters; and the accomplished but rather 
staid, non-period interpretations of Helmuth Rilling. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, it's newsworthy when the best of today's antiquarians set their sights 
on Bach, as in the handsome Harmonia Mundi release (901479) that has Philippe 
Herreweghe leading his superb Collegium Vocale, in fact a Ghent (Belgium)-based 
vocal and instrumental ensemble, and a strong solo quartet, anchored by the 
sturdy basso of Peter Kooy, in the Cantata BWV 11, the so-called "Ascension" 
Oratorio. 
</P>
<P>
 The wonder of such a work as this is in Bach's ability to shift so easily from 
the celebratory, trumpets-and-drums rhythmic style to his most profoundly 
meditative, lyrical vein. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the generous program offers the lesser-known but decidedly 
worthwhile cantatas BWV 43, "Gott fahret auf mit Jauchzen," and BWV 44, "Sie 
werden euch in Bann tun," in equally well-crafted readings. 
</P>
<P>
 This in contrast to a trio of cantatas from Bach at his most intimate and 
reflective, which means at his most harmonically daring, played and sung by the 
Bay Area-based American Bach Soloists under Jeffrey Thomas' direction (Koch 
7164). 
</P>
<P>
 Included are two of Bach's loftiest inspirations, the darkly hypnotic BWV 106, 
"Gottes Zeit," with its striking dissonances, and the blissfully soothing 
"Komm, du susse Todesstunde." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas' leadership is, alas, soporific. The pacing is lethargic, and the 
singing of the principal vocalist, Drew Minter, the possessor of a matchlessly 
agile, buttery countertenor, is inexpressive. Thomas' own strained tenor hardly 
helps. 
</P>
<P>
 Baritone William Sharp offers a measure of compensation with his alertly 
dramatic solo work in BWV 152, "Tritt auf die Glaubensbahn." On the whole, 
however, a major disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Paris-based American harpsichordist Skip Sempe offers cutting-edge Bach 
style in a new recording with his Capriccio Stravagante ensemble (Deutsche 
Harmonia Mundi/BMG 77222). 
</P>
<P>
 Sempe launches the program with a thrilling keyboard solo, his own 
flamboyantly inventive improvisation on the familiar Chaconne for solo violin, 
and proceeds to an immensely vital, highly decorated (this is, after all 
Baroque music) D-major Partita. 
</P>
<P>
 The remainder of Sempe's program is likewise for the adventurous listener: 
One-instrument-to-a-part, precariously bold -- in their rhythmic freedom and 
incisiveness of articulation -- performances of the harpsichord concertos in D 
and A, BWV 1054 and 1055. 
</P>
<P>
 A no-less-historically informed, if more sober scholarly, viewpoint is offered 
by Germany's Camerata Koln: a fascinating collection of concerto 
reconstructions featuring the solo oboe and oboe d'amore of Hans-Peter 
Westermann, highlighted by the purported original of the A-major Harpsichord 
Concerto and a wonderfully lean, yet by no means chill reading of the Concerto 
for Oboe and Violin, after the C-minor concerto for two harpsichords, BWV 1060. 
Violinist Mary Utiger is Westermann's skilled partner here (Deutsche Harmonia 
Mundi/BMG 77290).

<P>
 This is a triple triumph for trombonist Watrous. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with his own beauty of sound, his breadth of range and inspiration of 
improvisation, it celebrates the talents of Johnny Mandel, who wrote all the 
tunes, and of Sammy Nestico, who penned most of the arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 The early jazz pieces Mandel wrote for Count Basie and Woody Herman work just 
as well as his timeless ballads, "Close Enough for Love," "The Shadow of Your 
Smile" and "Emily." This last tune features a wondrous introduction on English 
horn by Phil Feather. Credit also to Shelly Berg, who played keyboards and 
wrote two of the charts. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent). LEONARD FEATHER

 FRANK ZAPPA: "THE YELLOW SHARK." Ensemble Modern, conducted by Peter 
Rundel.Barking Pumpkin R2 71600. Beyond and apart from his occasional 
reputation as a willful, antisocial maverick with a love of bad manners, the 
recently deceased Frank Zappa maintained a long -- and mostly unrequited -- 
love affair with the serious 20th-Century music tradition. The fascinating 
fruits of Zappa's orchestral labors are ample on "The Yellow Shark," a suite 
performed with affectionate precision and stylistic elasticity by the Ensemble 
Modern. Virtuosic irreverence and post-serial introspection make for perfect 
bedfellows on this ambitious project, where reference points include Weill, 
Berg, Varese and Zappa's own neo-Dada. A powerful discographic swan song. JOSEF 
WOODARD

 * * * 1/2 Brian Lynch, "Live at the Main Event," Criss Cross. This is a gutsy, 
flavorful date, spotlighting the ex-Art Blakey, now Phil Woods trumpeter, whose 
tone snaps and pops, and whose lyricism is compelling.Also featured is organist 
Melvin Rhyne, whose sound -- open yet subtle -- recalls the late Larry Young. 
The two, plus saxman Ralph Moore, guitarist Peter Bernstein and drummer Kenny 
Washington, vigorously interpret Rhyne's tasty, Latin-ish "Nite 'Vidual I," 
Horace Silver's flowing "Ecaroh" and Arthur Hamilton's classic ballad "Cry Me a 
River." A class effort all around, and you'll have to turn over a lot of rocks 
to find a blues cliche.

 ETERNAL CABALLE: Songs and arias. Montserrat Caballe, soprano; various 
orchestras and conductors. BMG 09026-61044-2. From the title of this two-disc 
set, one would think it an "in memoriam" recording.In a way, it is. About half 
the selections date from the '60s and '70s, when the Caballe soprano was in its 
prime. The voice was all dark Iberian velvet, of ample lyric size, with some 
limited coloratura facility (she never could trill or manage runs with ease). 
But there were those otherworldly pianissimo tones and the sheer glow of the 
sound. The other half was made two years ago when the singer was 58. In some 
popular Spanish songs, crooned in lower keys, where the top is not exposed, the 
tone is still appealing, although the bottom range is breathy and usupported. 
An oddity is a song taken from the second movement of Rodrigo's "Aranuez" for 
guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 It is in her atrociously accented French selections that Caballe achieves near 
travesty. "Pleurez mes yeux," the Habanera and "Mon coeur" are sung with 
uncertain pitch, a wobble throughout the range, an absense of musical line and 
(in the Massenet) desperate lunges at the top that are as painful to hear as 
they must have been to sing. She throws in Andrew Lloyd Weber's "Wishing you 
were somehow here again" from "Phantom" in imcomprehensible English. At last, 
Caballe in her current estate has found a composer worthy of her. WALTER PRICE

</P>
<P>
 A luminous, buoyant, conversational quality informs this music, which is 
delivered handily by guitarist Eubanks and a stellar cast: bassist Dave 
Holland, drummers Marvin (Smitty) Smith and Mark Mondesir, trombonist (and the 
leader's brother) Robin Eubanks and flutist Kent Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 The tunes, which are sometimes just riffs to get into the solos, come alive. 
They are often centered around recurring basslines and engaging rhythms, which 
give the soloists a dandy platform from which to work. The music alternates 
between relaxed and charged, a bit like rafting on the Colorado River as it 
slowly, then furiously wends its way through the Grand Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Eubanks enjoys plotting simultaneous improvisations by two or three players. 
On "Landing," Jordan and the Eubanks brothers improvise together, then Holland 
and the leader do the same. The sort-of back-beat "Earth Party" crackles with 
energy and concludes with a bashing Smith solo, delivered against bass and 
guitar lines. "Journey" finds Eubanks playing two guitars, via overdubs, but 
the intuitive interplay makes it seem as if he's duetting with another 
musician.

 * * * 1/2 Steve Lacy Octet, "Vespers," Soul Note. This is an absorbing work 
that fully realizes the soprano saxophonist's objectives as a composer.The song 
cycle celebrates four deceased musicians and three visual artists, with the 
texts drawn from poems by female Bulgarian poet-politician Blaga Dimitrova. 
Adding Ricky Ford's tenor and Tom Varner's French horn to Lacy's regular sextet 
gives "Vespers" a fuller sound and Irene Aebi's vocals -- which can be 
problematic -- fit perfectly in the controlled context. The carefully crafted 
compositions are beautifully executed and the quiet assurance of the solos 
grows with repeated listenings.

POP FACES: FAITH HILL; TAKE HER AS SHE IS -- BLUE OR NOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a wonder country singer Faith Hill's debut album, "Take Me as I Am," 
didn't turn out to be a collection of tear-drenched laments. 
</P>
<P>
 The 26-year-old Mississippi native admits having a bad case of the blues while 
recording it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going through a divorce and I wasn't too happy a lot of the time," says 
Hill. "So the sad songs may be a little sadder. But I didn't want to do one of 
those typical country albums full of crying about lost loves." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, who co-wrote two of the songs on her Warner Bros. album, says her main 
goal was to make a record that would speak to other women. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talk to women about being strong -- saying don't be a doormat and be a 
decision maker," she says. "I don't preach to them . . . it's all fairly 
subtle. It's important for me to be accepted by female fans." 
</P>
<P>
 But what about that glamour image that her record company seems to be pushing? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very careful about that -- not to let it go too far," Hill explains. "I 
know this is an incredibly tough business and there are certain things you have 
to do to get to be one of the handful that breaks through. But I don't want to 
appear threatening to women. That glamour thing alienates them." 
</P>
<P>
 But the campaign -- and music -- is also scoring with the opposite sex. "Most 
of my mail is from men," Hill admits sheepishly. "But I don't think they're 
getting a different message than the one I'm presenting to women." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Hill's appeal is a seductive twang in her voice and the heart-tugging 
Angst that reverberates through her ballads. Chalk that up to the Patsy Cline 
influence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't do without her music," Hill says of the late country singer. "I 
listen to it for inspiration -- particularly just before I go on stage. Her 
voice gives me chills. She gives me a goal to reach for." 
</P>
<P>
 As a teen-ager in Star, Miss. (population: 1,500), Hill sang whenever she got 
a chance -- in church, school and social gatherings. Increasingly serious about 
a show-biz career, she moved to Nashville when she was 19. 
</P>
<P>
 For five years, Hill paid the usual dues -- working as a receptionist and 
singing backup vocals in tiny clubs. She didn't get her record deal until last 
year. But things have happened fast since then. Hill's first single, an upbeat 
tune called "Wild One," has hit No. 1 on the country charts and she's landed a 
coveted spot as the opening act on an upcoming Reba McEntire tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back on the long-shot move to Nashville, Hill says, "It was crazy -- I 
had no job and I didn't know anybody in town. I'm headstrong and incredibly 
ambitious. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back home in Star, people's lives are all mapped out -- they get married, 
they grow old and die there. I was driven by all these dreams -- dreams that 
just weren't going to come true in Star." DENNIS HUNT

POP FACES: R. KELLY; SULTAN OF RAUNCH SLAM-DUNKS UP THE CHARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Singer-rapper R. Kelly says he always gets a good laugh when he hears people 
describe his hit single "Sex Me" as steamy. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't realize this is the clean version -- you should have heard it 
before the cuts," he says, referring to the trims by nervous record-label 
executives. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way it was originally, they were afraid it wouldn't get any airplay, so 
they cut it to the bone. The original version was written after I'd been cooped 
up in the studio so long that I wasn't able to party like I usually do. I just 
let my feelings out writing that song." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sex Me" is the first single from his Jive Records album, "12 Play," which 
also includes such songs as "I Like the Crotch On You" and "Your Body's 
Callin'." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the assorted edits, the album is far raunchier than his 1991 
million-selling debut, "Born Into the '90s," which established him as a force 
in the R&B/hip-hop market. 
</P>
<P>
 "On my first album I was holding back," says Kelly. "This second album is the 
album I wanted to make the first time. But I didn't want to come on too strong 
too soon." 
</P>
<P>
 These days the joke about Kelly is that the R. in his name (actually short for 
Robert) really stands for raunchy. But he insists he doesn't have a one-track 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new album isn't totally about sex," says Kelly, who was signed by Jive 
two years ago after his manager discovered him at a 1990 audition. "I tried to 
get some variety on the album. I've also written and produced three songs for 
the Winans' gospel group. Now would people as religious as they are work with a 
sex maniac?" 
</P>
<P>
 When Kelly, 24, was growing up on Chicago's South Side, a music career never 
crossed his mind. Basketball was his first love. "Back then that's all I cared 
about," recalls Kelly, who was a starter for his high school team. "My goal was 
to be the next Michael Jordan." 
</P>
<P>
 But a teacher changed all that. Spotting a glimmer of music potential, Lena 
McLin -- whom he calls his second mother -- talked him into singing a Stevie 
Wonder number in a talent show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a great response from the crowd and I felt this incredible rush -- like 
nothing I felt from basketball," explains Kelly, who still plays basketball 
just about every day. "I knew then what I wanted to do for the rest of my 
life." DENNIS HUNT

 Smashing Pumpkins' "Siamese Dream" had a smashing week on The Times' Southern 
California pop album chart, bounding from No. 11 to No. 5. Meanwhile, Snoop 
Doggy Dogg has reason to howl with glee: The rapper's "Doggystyle" not only 
reclaimed the top spot on the pop album and R&B charts, but maintained its lead 
in the rap realm. The way Frank Sinatra's "Duets" album plummeted, from No. 2 
to No. 14 after the holidays, you can only conclude that it was a hugely 
popular Christmas gift. Without the gift-buying market -- or a hit single -- 
can "Duets" rally and return to the Top 10? Don't bet on it. TOP 10 ALBUMS

 It might seem early to devote so many pages to a band that didn't become 
famous till two years ago, but this is no typical quickie pop bio. Azerrad's 
exhaustive, evenhanded account of the rise of this year's Times critics-poll 
winner is the rare tome that really takes you inside both the business and soul 
of rock 'n' roll, providing the lurid details and lucid pop criticism too. 
</P>
<P>
 It's "authorized" and laudatory, but more respectful of Kurt Cobain's talent 
than his character; it takes an unflinching look at drug use, and isn't afraid 
to call Cobain on hypocrisy or even an occasional lame lyric. Anyone in a 
fledgling band could stand to read its threats and promises of what happens 
when slackers become stars.

 Most interesting spin control: The controversial ending to the "Black or 
White" video has been restored, but now the windows Jacko smashes all have 
racist slogans digitally added, to make his spree of destruction seem less 
wanton. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Most interesting non -spin control: Endless scenes of Jackson playing Uncle 
Mikey to half the world's children -- which makes for uncomfortable viewing 
even divorced from its current context, on sappiness alone. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Worst tune: "Heal the World," at the Super Bowl. Most touching: "I'll Be 
There," a brief duet between Jackson and his younger self, in a previously 
unseen European cola commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 What a bizarre grab bag, from brilliance to bathos in a blink, as is M.J.'s 
way.

 Prescient as the Akron, Ohio, band proved, Devo was wrong on one score: 
Evolution continues, at least for videophiles who've given up low-on-the-ladder 
VHS for the digital superiority of laser discs. And as pop music goes, this is 
the format's most visionary application yet.The complete catalogue of Devo 
videos from the mid-'70s on (the early groundbreaking ones still being 
spookiest and best) is only the beginning. You also get a separate audio 
commentary track and still-frame text in which the head spuds wax historical 
and funnily bitter about their experiences with everyone from David Bowie and 
Eno to assorted record company weasels.

RECORD RACK: RIDING ACROSS A WIDE EMOTIONAL RANGE

 COWBOY JUNKIES 
</P>
<P>
 "Pale Sun, Crescent Moon" 
</P>
<P>
 RCA  
</P>
<P>
 * * * 1/2 
</P>
<P>
 With its sunny air and lyrics about the joys of "a cup of coffee and wearing 
your ring," "Anniversary Song" may be the brightest pop paean to domestic bliss 
since John Lennon's "Double Fantasy" numbers. That contented tone is so strong 
that it virtually spills over the rest of this Canadian group's fifth album, 
largely written by guitarist Michael Timmins and honey-voiced by his sister 
Margo. 
</P>
<P>
 The magic of the Junkies, though, is a concurrent sense of dis contentedness, 
a kind of buzz evocative of all-night drives across the North American plains, 
or all-night ponderings of life's subtleties. That bittersweet balance was 
already defined with the group's 1988 breakthrough album, "The Trinity 
Session," but here it's expanded and elaborated on, with a wider range of 
dynamics both musical (from hypnotic, folkie atmospheres to roiling, rocky 
blues) and emotional. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, perhaps, this album veers away from the "Trinity" mysticism in 
favor of more standard pop tones. But the message seems to be that even a 
content life is full of mysteries, and these songs are no less poetic for the 
explicitness and maturity; lyrical quotes from William Faulkner and Gabriel 
Garcia Marquez are not the least bit out of place. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, this is adult music, largely free of the rage and dysfunction that marks 
much rock, yet just as compelling through its wealth of complexities, and all 
the more welcome for it.

before: the racy bedroom chatter, the anguished pleas to a turned-off mate, the 
giddy declarations of everlasting love.But not quite like this. On its second 
album, this vocal quartet energizes the tired R&B formulas with soulful 
harmonizing and some of the nastiest slow grooves you'll ever hear. A big 
improvement over their excessively dramatic, cliche-ridden first album.

"Alarm" abandons the electric-disco, P-Funk-driven sound of Del's 1991 debut 
album for a starker rhythmic landscape, allowing the 21-year-old Oakland 
rapper's tumbling rhyme flow to shine.While the first effort was largely 
influenced by Del's Southland cousin, Ice Cube, "Alarm" employs the production 
skills of a variety of Oaktown artists, whose use of brooding cellos, jangly 
pianos and obscure samples make the new album more inventive.

POP EYE: THE '94 LIST: STONES VS. STONE ROSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Heidi Siegmund

<TEXT>
<P>
 Coming off a record sales year, the pop world is counting on a highly diverse 
array of key albums to maintain the 1993 momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows whether the next 12 months can duplicate the phenomenal sales punch 
of 1993, during which the "Bodyguard" soundtrack album sold 10 million copies, 
g-style rappers became household names (can you say Dr. Dre and Snoop Doggy 
Dogg? Sure you can) and the sophomore jinx was defied by alternative rockers 
Nirvana and Pearl Jam? 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the albums drawing the most early attention, industry insiders are 
optimistic because the coming months offer the same kind of diverse pop lineup 
that characterized 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are 10 of the collections that are likely to generate the most attention 
during the first half of 1994: 
</P>
<P>
 * Ice Cube and Dr. Dre -- The teaming of the N.W.A. alumni could give us the 
rap album of the year. Tentatively titled "Helter Skelter," the collection, 
which could be in the stores as early as June, matches Cube (arguably the most 
acclaimed West Coast rapper) and Dre (unarguably the most talented producer in 
all of rap). 
</P>
<P>
 * Nine Inch Nails -- Trent Reznor, the one-man industrial music wizard, 
releases in March his first full-length follow-up to 1990's groundbreaking 
"Pretty Hate Machine." Titled "The Downward Spiral," the album was partially 
recorded in the Benedict Canyon home that was the scene of the Manson Family 
murder of Sharon Tate and four others. Reznor set up a home studio, which he 
calls "Pig," in the rented house. 
</P>
<P>
 * Arrested Development -- After winning Grammys as the best new artist and 
best rap group of 1992, the Atlanta outfit expects to have its follow-up 
completed in time for a summer release. 
</P>
<P>
 * Lyle Lovett -- The country-pop singer-songwriter has finished "Creeps Like 
Me," his first album since 1992's "Joshua Judges Ruth" -- and his first since 
his celebrated marriage last July to actress Julia Roberts. It's due in the 
spring. Lovett also will be featured on a soul-meets-country duet collection 
whose participants include Al Green, Natalie Cole, Vince Gill and Gladys 
Knight. It's scheduled for March release. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bonnie Raitt -- The blues-based rocker, whose 1991 "Luck of the Draw" proved 
to be an even bigger commercial success than 1989's "Nick of Time," returns in 
March with "Longing in Their Hearts." 
</P>
<P>
 * Soundgarden -- Although one of the most respected bands in the Seattle 
grunge scene, this band has been somewhat overshadowed by the success of 
Nirvana and Pearl Jam. A&M is hoping that "Superunknown," due in March, will 
correct that. 
</P>
<P>
 * Red Hot Chili Peppers -- Currently on its fourth guitarist (Dave Navarro, 
from Jane's Addiction), the Los Angeles funk-punk pioneers are aiming for a 
midsummer release for the follow-up to their mainstream breakthrough, "Blood 
Sugar Sex Magik." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Stone Roses -- After a five-year delay, the Manchester quartet's 
upcoming "Second Coming" couldn't be more aptly titled. When Geffen Records 
signed the critically acclaimed group after its 1989 album made it the toast of 
British rock, the Roses seemed poised to storm the U.S. charts. But after all 
this time, is anyone still waiting for the group's second album? If so, they'll 
find it in the stores in March. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hole -- In a dazzling Palace show last November, the punk-spawned band, led 
by volatile and charismatic Courtney Love, played a collection of new songs 
that reflected a vitality and depth that could earn Hole a place on the 
national charts. Let's hope that those songs will dominate the April album. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Rolling Stones -- You never know with these guys. Just when you count 
them out, they can pop up with another gem, a la 1978's "Some Girls" or 1981's 
"Tattoo You." But we certainly didn't get one with the 1989 tour's leaden 
"Steel Wheels." Heidi Siegmund

 FATHERS AND SONS: On its 1984 Slash Records album, Los Lobos asked the musical 
question: "How Will the Wolf Survive?" The answer: By making the pack bigger. 
</P>
<P>
 At the group's New Year's Eve show at the Oxnard Civic Auditorium, the sons of 
drummer Louie Perez and guitarist/accordionist David Hidalgo came on stage to 
play with the band, subbing for their fathers on "Wicked Rain," a song from the 
group's "Kiko" album. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the pups don't play the same instruments as their pops. Louie III, 
a 17-year-old senior at Laguna Beach High, ripped out some mean guitar riffs, 
while 16-year-old David Jr., who attends Whittier Christian, pounded the drums 
like a pro. Those are, however, the instruments originally played by their 
fathers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started out on the guitar and David (Hidalgo Sr.) played the drums and it 
was that way until about 1980," said the elder Perez. "I always had guitars 
around the house. My son has been playing since he was about 12 years old and 
David Jr.'s been playing since he was about 2," said the drummer, who laughed 
as he added: "Much to my dismay. . . . I was hoping they wouldn't turn out to 
be musicians." 
</P>
<P>
 It's too late. The young wolves have been playing together for a few years and 
Louie III even has his own band, Villains 99. Though the two have occasionally 
played with Los Lobos on tour, it was the first time they've performed with 
their dads in Southern California, where Lobos shows often resemble family 
reunions with relatives and friends crowding the backstage area. 
</P>
<P>
 So how did they do at their impromptu, unrehearsed New Year's Eve appearance? 
"They were great," said an obviously proud Perez. "They always amaze me." Oscar 
Garza

BUDD FRIEDMAN; IMPROV'S 'BENIGN DICTATOR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK CRISAFULLI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perhaps the most familiar face in Los Angeles comedy is the smiling visage of 
Budd Friedman, the man behind the Improv. Since 1981, Friedman's been using 
television to promote his clubs, and his appearances as a chuckling audience 
member and host of A&E's "Evening at the Improv" series have made him a 
nationally recognized figure in the comedy world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Club owners may complain that there's too much stand-up on TV," he says, "but 
they're usually the ones that don't have a show. Television has been great for 
the Improv, generating money and goodwill. And I don't think it's affected the 
club crowds poorly, because for all the comedy on TV, the club is still a very 
different experience." 
</P>
<P>
 With partner Mark Lonow, Friedman has opened Improvs across the country, 
including the Santa Monica branch in 1988. Friedman notes that his clubs are 
not immune to hard times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in the business for 30 years, and every year the business grew. 
That pattern changed two years ago. There's no city in America I could think 
about going into with a new place right now." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1963, after a brief career in advertising, Friedman used some inheritance 
money to open a small, late-night coffeehouse and restaurant in New York that 
catered to the theater crowd. Entertainment at the Improv was first a mix of 
music, comedy and variety, and there were nights when Judy Garland, Liza 
Minnelli and Peter Allen shared the tiny stage. But it didn't take long for the 
prodigal comics of Manhattan to realize they'd found a home base. Rodney 
Dangerfield became the unofficial house emcee, and Robert Klein was the 
Improv's first breakout comedy star. 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman brought the Improv to the West Coast in 1976, to its present spot on 
Melrose in West Hollywood. He became a permanent L.A. fixture when he sold the 
New York club in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I came to L.A., Jimmie Walker, Jay Leno and Freddie Prinze were the 
nucleus of what was happening at the Comedy Store. I had to bring out somebody 
special from New York to get the Improv noticed. I went with Andy Kaufman and 
then brought out Elayne Boosler. It worked." 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman describes his role in the clubs as that of "benign dictator" and even 
makes light of his reputation for being an occasionally tough taskmaster: 
</P>
<P>
 "Richard Pryor once said I had taken advantage of him because he was black, 
and I was absolutely heartbroken. When I got home my wife said, 'You should 
have told him you take advantage of all performers, regardless of race, creed 
or color.' I told Richard that line and he loved it. We had no trouble being 
friends again." CHUCK CRISAFULLI

MITZI SHORE; STILL MINDING THE STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK CRISAFULLI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After 21 years of operation, the Comedy Store is still a vital steppingstone 
for Hollywood's developing comics, as well as a respected workshop for proven 
vets. And Mitzi Shore is still there most nights, continuing as the godmother 
of Los Angeles comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're like a school, or a boxers' gym," Shore says. "We're here to help 
people develop their skills, and to get them seen by supportive comedy crowds, 
as well as by TV and movie people." 
</P>
<P>
 The Comedy Store was opened in 1972 by Mitzi and her husband, comedian Sammy 
Shore, on the site of the legendary Hollywood nightspot Ciro's. The Store began 
life as more of a variety room than a comedy club, but when Sammy resumed his 
career on the road, Mitzi was left in charge. She decided to create a showcase 
for stand-up comics -- the only one in town until the Improv opened in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Shores separated in 1973, bettering the club became Mitzi's primary 
focus. In 1976, she bought the Sunset Strip building in which the club was 
housed and developed it into the three-room venue it is today. David Letterman 
was an early emcee at the club, and Robin Williams, Garry Shandling and Jim 
Carrey are all graduates of the Store's stage. A more recent graduate is 
Mitzi's son Pauly, who did not get the maternal push into comedy one might 
expect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't encourage Pauly," his mother exclaims. "I made it tough for him. He 
had to work hard all around town before he got a break on the stage at the 
Comedy Store." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the troubled economic times, and the national slumps in comedy club 
attendance, Mitzi Shore remains highly optimistic about the comedy business in 
L.A.: 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what's happening to the scene is actually very healthy. Across the 
country, a lot of clubs that have been nurturing mediocre talent are closing 
down, so more of the real stand-up talent is coming to Hollywood. I'm relieved 
to see that process happen. It's a healthy purification." 
</P>
<P>
 With Sunday potluck nights offering anyone the chance to test his or her comic 
prowess -- and specialty nights for women, Latino, and gay and lesbian comics 
-- Shore believes that the Comedy Store provides a crucial training ground for 
all kinds of comics and all kinds of comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see marvelous new talents all the time," she says. "I know it's hard for 
them to develop out on the road, where you have to worry about pleasing the guy 
that's selling the beer. It's hard to treat yourself as an artist under those 
circumstances. In a workshop environment like the Comedy Store, you just worry 
about pleasing yourself. If you're naturally funny, you'll get the laughs you 
deserve." CHUCK CRISAFULLI

JAMIE MASADA; FOREMAN OF THE FACTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK CRISAFULLI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I don't ever like to talk about what I've done for successful comedians," 
says Laugh Factory proprietor Jamie Masada. "I can only talk about what they've 
done for me. Comedians have made me what I am, and without them I'd be nobody." 
</P>
<P>
 Masada plunged into the Hollywood comedy scene in 1974, a 14-year-old Israeli 
emigre traveling without family, without much money, and with oversized dreams 
of stand-up stardom. He quickly garnered a taste of the comic spotlight when he 
made the jump from busboy work to stage time at the Comedy Store. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got to follow Redd Foxx one night," he recalls. "I started my routine, and 
then Redd came back up to give me some help. We told dirty jokes together. That 
was my baptism in show business." 
</P>
<P>
 Masada continued to work as a performer, but he also began to sense that local 
comics needed an alternative to the established venues around town. In 
December, 1979, using borrowed money, Masada turned a small Sunset Boulevard 
storefront into the Laugh Factory. 
</P>
<P>
 It was rough going at first, with Masada working every night as emcee, doorman 
and maintenance worker. Insiders were giving odds on how long the new owner's 
folly would last, but Masada thought he'd found his calling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I brought in a group of older people from the Fairfax District one night, 
just to give the comics an audience," he says. "These people came in looking 
sad and beaten down and left with their faces lit up. That's when I knew I was 
in the right business." 
</P>
<P>
 And the business has been good to him. He expanded the club to its present 
size in 1987, and he's watched many of the biggest names in comedy work their 
craft on his stage, including Jerry Seinfeld, Roseanne Arnold, Damon Wayans and 
Tim Allen. Masada still takes the time to give personal attention to each 
performer at the club's Tuesday open-mike nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Masada acknowledges that times are tough for the clubs, but he believes that 
owners will determine their own destiny: 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here to make people laugh and enjoy themselves. A lot of owners forgot 
that during the boom. They herded people in like cattle, got two drinks' worth 
out of them, and kicked them out. Who wants to go back for that? Simple 
courtesy would bring people back to the clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We shouldn't blame TV, and we shouldn't blame the comics. It's up to club 
owners whether or not comedy gets healthy again. If we change our attitude, the 
business is still there." CHUCK CRISAFULLI

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; JOHN CAPONERA SEGUES FROM STAND-UP TO SITCOM AND FINDS A 
BARREL OF LAUGHS LIVING 'THE GOOD LIFE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE VILLASENOR, Anne Villasenor is a Los Angeles-based free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chicago-native John Caponera never expected to do stand-up. In fact, he really 
wanted to act. But thanks to that short detour, he's starring in NBC's new show 
"The Good Life," based, ironically, on his own life as a stand-up. 
</P>
<P>
 "In real life, John Bowman is a lot more patient and gives people the benefit 
of the doubt more than I do," Caponera says about his TV character. "But as far 
as his integrity and being opinionated, we're very much the same person, and 
that's one thing I wanted to make sure I brought to the show." Drawing from 
such favorites as "The Honeymooners," "The Dick Van Dyke Show" and "The Andy 
Griffith Show," he finds his character a unique blend of that kind of 
old-fashioned humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the workplace, I'm like a Ralph Kramden dealing with two Nortons, and the 
show's a lot like 'The Dick Van Dyke Show' where I work with two crazy people: 
So much of the laughs and wackiness comes from the workplace. I have my home 
and family life, and I bridge the gap between the two," he says. "I also think 
of myself as Andy of Mayberry dealing with a Barney and an Otis. I deal with 
Drew (Carey) and Monty (TK), and I'm constantly reacting off their shenanigans. 
Drew Carey and I are best friends on the show, we're partners at work, and 
we're partners in crime -- outside of work. We manage the kids' baseball games 
together, and we golf together. We're best buddies, so we're like Norton and 
Kramden a lot, too," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Caponera's career took off at Lewis University in Lockport, Ill., after a 
7-minute monologue for a speech class got him an A. And his material, which he 
called the "Hollywood Celebrity Baseball Game," became a stand-up act he 
performed at local venues. Eventually he got a job in his hometown of Chicago 
where he juggled tending bar and stand-up every night. "I would actually go on 
stage some nights, emcee, and before I brought out the first act, I'd take a 
drink order from the stage. Then I'd go back, bartend, come back and bring up 
the next guy as drinks were served because it was just the waitress and me." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, Caponera moved to Los Angeles to compete in "Star Search's" comedy 
division and also to pursue his acting career. "I'm glad I did (the comedy) 
because when my time came, when I got a legitimate shot, I was ready," he says. 
"I had enough schooling and classes behind me to handle it." 
</P>
<P>
 Today the eight-year L.A. resident is acting as originally planned, with the 
segue from stand-up a much easier one to adjust to. "I think it's a natural 
transition for a comic to do a sitcom because a sitcom is just a series of 
laughs inside a situation. If you can deliver a line and stay in character, 
you're already halfway home," he says. "I think what helped me, though, is that 
I could also be the straight man too. I didn't have to carry a scene. I can 
pass the ball and let the other guy roll with it and feel very secure and 
comfortable with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Caponera, AGE, finds it difficult to favor stand-up or acting. "I don't think 
you can get a bigger high than from doing stand-up, getting that acceptance 
from a crowd and that control you have over them, but (with acting) there's a 
different sense of accomplishment when you can carry a scene. You can move 
people another way in acting than you can in comedy," he says. "I can take a 
monologue or a scene with someone on stage to an audience in a theater and move 
them in a certain way that I can't as a stand-up comedian." 
</P>
<P>
 And maybe that's why John Caponera's now doing both....and living "The Good 
Life." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Good Life" airs Tuesdays at 8:30 p.m. on NBC.

FOCUS; NO LAUGHING MATTER; ONCE AGAIN, COMIC RELIEF AND HBO HOPE TO HELP THE 
HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELE WILLENS, Michele Willens is a frequent contributor to TV Times and 
Calendar.

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the early '70s, Bob Zmuda and Chris Albrecht were stand-up comedy partners, 
but eventually each got off the stage and went his own way. Until 1986, when 
Zmuda, deeply concerned about the homeless, sought out his former partner who 
was an executive at HBO. Was there a way of putting humor and homelessness 
together, Zmuda asked? Comedians and then-budding actors Robin Williams, Whoopi 
Goldberg and Billy Crystal shared a passion on the issue and Comic Relief was 
born. 
</P>
<P>
 The now-annual telethon airs this Saturday on HBO. After previous stints at 
the Universal Amphitheatre and Radio City Music Hall, it is being produced at 
the Shrine Auditorium for the first time. The three original hosts return, 
joined by a long list of those at the top of the comedy field. Alan Kind, Paul 
Rodriguez, Garry Shandling, Brett Butler, Paula Poundstone, Kristie Alley and 
John Laroquette will make the obligatory pitches for donations to the Comic 
Reief organization. That group has raised some $20 million since its inception 
with all funds going directly to homeless shelters around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 But in these times of everyone pitching for something, or pinching pennies, 
how to keep the issue urgent, the show fresh? 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of getting the talent, it's actually gotten easier," says Zmuda, who 
became a comedy writer-producer and is now president and founder of Comic 
Relief. "In the beginning no one knew who we were. And while they're all in it 
because it's a good cause it's also a real comedy showcase. But hey, you can't 
keep doing the same show every year." 
</P>
<P>
 So, he is always in search of new concepts. This year, Comic Relief is 
organizing an on- stage reunion of the "Your Show of Shows" cast. In addition, 
the cast and crew of the syndicated "Star Trek: The Next Generation" will do a 
bit in which they look back on what all this was about. "What was 
homelessness?" they'll wonder. "What was Comic Relief?" "What was a Whoopie?" 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the biggest change over the years, according to the Comic Relief 
folks, is that Goldberg and her co-hosts have since become mega-stars. Yet they 
remain committed to the cause and the show (though not enough to do more than a 
few television interviews this year). "What's most remarkable to me is the fact 
that the hosts, who are more famous than ever and whose time is more valuable 
than ever, are still involved," says Chris Albrecht, senior vice present of 
original programming for HBO. "I think if they stopped doing it, they'd be hard 
to replace in terms of quality and credibility." 
</P>
<P>
 HBO has consistently stayed with the event and, according to Albrecht, "to 
finally decide we're not going to do it anymore would seem almost immoral." For 
the cable network, there is nothing in this but a good conscience. 
</P>
<P>
 "The show costs more every year to do," Albrecht says, "but after the first 
one, we were just amazed how good it felt to do it and we still feel that way." 
In fact, HBO opens up its signals to other outlets that night so, as Albrecht 
adds, "we don't even use the time to sell HBO. All you have to have is cable to 
see entertainment that is as good as it gets." 
</P>
<P>
 What HBO offers the performers is a place to reach millions with their humor 
-- the uncensored variety. "Part of the attraction is it's not sanitized," says 
Albrecht. "We don't want to offend anyone so they turn off the TV," he adds, 
"but we certainly provide a great creative opportunity." With comedians, one 
can expect some profanity, but Comic Relief's organizers say it tends to get 
friskier as the night wears on and they schedule accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 While clearly there are some performers who lend their services to the evening 
because it's the best showcase, not to mention the best party in town, many 
feel strongly that it's the right thing to do. Paul Rodriguez has done the show 
since it began and spends many quiet, camera-free hours every year visiting 
some of the shelters where Comic Relief's money has gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of these people I visit don't even know who we are. I mean, it ain't 
like they got cable," says the comedian. "But you'd be surprised how happy they 
can be with a little help, a few jokes, a pat on the back. I know that what 
Comic Relief does is just a drop in the bucket, but it's our bucket. I'm 
personally most concerned about mothers with children and when you look in the 
faces of these kids, you can't not help. Regardless of how they got there, 
those kids shouldn't have to pick up the check. So we can pay now or pay 
later." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only is this the first year for the Shrine, but it's the first time the 
event has been held so close to the holidays (done around the hosts' 
schedules). That scheduling could cut either way, the organizers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "People may be tapped out," worries Zmuda, "but overall it could be good 
because hopefully, they will still be in a compassionate and giving mood." 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a tougher sell this year," adds Rodriguez, "mostly because there 
have been some well-publicized scams and people's hearts have been hardened. 
But you know, ultimately, we're not going to be judged by how many highway or 
golf courses we build, but by how charitable we were to our fellow Americans 
when they were suffering." 
</P>
<P>
 "Comic Relief" airs Saturday at 9 p.m. on HBO and other selected cable 
channels.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: FUN ON TAP AT GORDON BIERSCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE OCHOA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Babe alert," said the pretty blond woman, just a couple years out of her 
teens, to her girlfriend dressed in mall-modified grunge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Total!" said her friend, setting down her dark malt lager as she spotted the 
two twinkle-eyed hunks walking out of the AMC theater and into view of the 
Sunday-night dinner crowd on the open-air terrace of the new Gordon Biersch 
brewpub. 
</P>
<P>
 The most persistent thing you hear about the brewpubs called Gordon Biersch -- 
there are three in Northern California -- is that they're great places to 
cruise for dates. The new Pasadena branch is no different: There is plenty of 
beer, plenty of noise and plenty of room to search and stroll. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gordon Biersch is trying to reach beyond the singles market. Huge, modern 
and ready for a crowd, it's located in one of L.A. County's newest public 
spaces, the freshly gentrified One Colorado complex, designed to seem more 
European town square than Southern California mall. Gordon Biersch is destined 
to become a gathering place for all sorts of people, looking for love or not. 
</P>
<P>
 The food, a mix of Mediterranean, Asian and American cooking, shows signs of 
serious-chef frippery. The trendy Italian pasta tripolini comes with pan-seared 
mushrooms; flatbread is served instead of pizza. But too much thought went into 
some of the dishes. Dressed mixed greens are overdone with goat cheese, pieces 
of flatbread and a big scoop of hummus on top; chicken pot pie is topped with 
herbed bread crumbs instead of a proper crust. Still, the grilled shrimp served 
with a corncake and nicely spiced cabbage slaw works well. And there are 
familiar beer-food staples, including calamari, ribs, sausages and burgers. 
</P>
<P>
 The house-made German-style beer is fine -- nothing with the character of, 
say, Dead Cat Lager, or even Sierra Nevada -- but refreshing. And it prompts 
one of the most welcome opening lines to be uttered by a waiter or waitress: 
"Would you like a free sampler of our beers?" 
</P>
<P>
 * Gordon Biersch, 41 Hugus Alley, One Colorado complex, (818) 449-0052. Dinner 
for two, food only, $30-$55.

RESTAURANT NEWS: NEW YEAR BEGINS SADLY FOR THE BISTRO AND TRA FIORI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 After 30 years and zillions of air kisses, the Bistro in Beverly Hills closed 
on New Year's Day. According to co-owner Christopher Niklas, son of founder 
Kurt Niklas, who opened the restaurant in 1963, it closed as a result of 
landlord and labor disputes. He says he expects the dispute with the new 
landlord to be resolved in court in March. But a new union contract could not 
be settled, and the employees picketed in protest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our patrons saw the picketing and it was not fun to look at," says 
Christopher Niklas. "It was becoming more of a hassle than it was worth." 
</P>
<P>
 Closing the restaurant effectively shut down negotiations. Niklas says that he 
and his father plan to reopen in May with a new name and a new format, but he 
won't say what the new format will be. "It will just be something different ," 
says Niklas, "a different look, a different menu, and a different staff." 
</P>
<P>
 According one source, the Bistro still has another five years left on its 
lease: "Kurt would never give up that place -- he pays practically no rent. The 
place is a gold mine." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bistro Garden in Beverly Hills and the Bistro Garden at Coldwater in 
Studio City remain open. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 ANOTHER NEW YEAR'S CASUALTY: The same day Pasadena celebrated the Rose Parade 
and the Rose Bowl, it lost one of its restaurants, Tra Fiori. (The name, 
ironically, means "among the flowers.") Located in the former Cafe Jacoulet 
space, the romantic Northern Italian restaurant was known as a local jazz spot 
during its 3 1/2 years in existence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great place and there was a great feeling there, but feelings don't 
translate into dollars," says Marie Moretti, one of the owners of the 
restaurant along with a number of Hollywood celebrities and stars from the 
horse racing world. The general partner was veterinary surgeon Greg Ferraro. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must have signed the lease the day before the recession started," says 
Moretti. "The dollars out there are limited and so someone is going to get 
squeezed out. Middle-quality food seems to be what's carrying people on right 
now." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 CON FUSION: Chef David Sharp, who cooked at the old Rosebud on Larchmont, is 
now fusing French-Mex cuisine at Tampico & Tilly's Restaurant & Club in Santa 
Moncia. Formerly known as Tampico Tilly's, Tampico is the restaurant, Tilly's 
the club. Dishes include a brie-and-basil quesadilla with mint and radish 
salsa, Roquefort tacos and tempeh fajitas.

 FRIENDLY COMPETITION: For a time, Charles Glenn was in the nightclub business 
-- Wall Street on Wilshire, Viola in the Beverly Center and Montego in Encino 
are some of the places he opened. Then he went in the bistro business and 
opened Le Pirate on La Cienega. But Glenn and his backer soon had a falling 
out, and the restaurant closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Glenn is backer-less but back on Restaurant Row. He's recently opened Le 
Bistro de Paris, down the street from the another French bistro, Cafe Maurice. 
"Maurice is my best friend," says Glenn. "I helped him start Cafe Maurice." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 MORE OPENINGS: Amedeo Costantino, who owns the Italian Fisherman Restaurant in 
Old Pasadena, has now taken over Talk O' the Town Restaurant on Foothill in 
Pasadena. The newly remodeled restaurant, which seats 120, is open for lunch 
and dinner daily. The regional Italian menu will feature everything from 
Cornish hens with wild rice to rack of lamb to pizzas and pastas. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 DINING DEALS: Deduct 15% from all dine-in food items ordered between 3 and 6 
p.m. at Encino City Wok, through Saturday. . . . In celebration of its 66th 
anniversary, Taix French Restaurant offers two meals for the price of one 
Monday through Saturday. Reservations are required and must be made before 5 
p.m. . . . The Derby -- the '30s-style supperclub adjoining Louise's Trattoria 
in the Los Feliz space opened in 1929 by Cecil B. DeMille as Willard's Chicken 
Inn -- now offers gospel brunches on the first Sunday of each month between 
11:30 a.m. and 2:30 p.m. Five prix-fixe ($16) brunch menus include grilled 
rosemary chicken, Italian frittata and chicken hash.

Q & A: AGAINST ALL ODDS; JIM STOLPA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 CBS' Sunday movie, "Snowbound: The Jim and Jennifer Stolpa Story," starring 
Neil Patrick Harris and Kelli Williams, chronicles the inspiring, true tale of 
heroism and unconditional love that mesmerized the world just over a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days after Christmas in 1992, Jim and Jennifer Stolpa, both then 21, and 
their 5-month-old son, Clayton, set out from their family home in San Francisco 
to drive to Pocatello, Idaho, to be with Stolpa's mother for his grandmother's 
funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 Stolpa, an Army private, wanted to avoid snow-covered routes. So, he and 
Jennifer took what they thought was a little-traveled but open road. Soon, in 
an isolated area of the country, they found themselves stranded in deep snow. 
After spending three days in their truck, the Stolpas set out to find help. 
Unable to go on, Jennifer and Clayton burrowed in a small cave for shelter, 
while Jim walked -- 70 miles -- to find help. 
</P>
<P>
 After their rescue, the Stolpas were hospitalized for a month and parts of 
their severely frostbitten feet needed to be amputated. Baby Clayton, bundled 
inside two sleeping bags and a garment bag throughout, came through unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
 Times Staff Writer Susan King talked with Jim Stolpa about the family's 
ordeal, their life now and the making of the movie chronicling their struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Are your lives back to normal? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, they had been for a while. We have been in our own apartment since June. 
We are doing fine. We can walk and Clay can walk now, too. He is starting to 
run. I have been given a disability retirement from the Army. Neither of us are 
working. We are waiting for the movie stuff to get over with because it would 
be kind of hard to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Did you receive numerous offers to have your story turned into a TV movie? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah. I don't know if anybody knows how many offers we got, because while we 
were in the hospital, they were contacting my stepfather. Then we got an agent 
and they contacted him, also. So we never really saw it first-hand. We kind of 
just let them take care of it and between the two of them they weeded through 
all of them and came up with the five they thought were the best. From there, 
Jennifer and I interviewed each of those five production companies to choose 
who we thought were best. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the interview was we asked them how much involvement would there be 
for us. And Michael Jaffe and Howard Braunstein wanted a lot of participation 
from us. 
</P>
<P>
 Did the writer, Jonathan Rintels, spend a lot of time with you? 
</P>
<P>
 The writer came out and spent three days with us just asking us questions at 
random about this and that. About a month later we got the first draft. Every 
time a new edition of the script would come out, we would get a copy and we 
would read it and give our input. Pretty much the whole time, right from the 
start, we had a say. 
</P>
<P>
 You and Jennifer were on location during the production. What was it like to 
relive your ordeal? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, seeing actors trying to portray things that we did was really awkward. 
At first it was very awkward, not just actors trying to be us, but watching 
this whole big film crew -- watching what they do and how they have to set up. 
</P>
<P>
 I think it would have been more emotional watching it if it was shot in order 
of how things actually happened. But since they shoot things out of order and 
shoot every scene four or five times, you watch it the first time and go, "Wow, 
I remember that." But then they do it again and again and again. It is just 
such an awkward feeling watching them do all of this because of something we 
did. 
</P>
<P>
 Did stars Neil Patrick Harris and Kelli Williams ask for your input? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah. The first day we went to Vancouver, we met them that night and the 
following morning we all went out for breakfast and talked. Neil and Kelli just 
had all of these questions. They were kind of asking us all of these questions 
that would help them understand more how we were feeling and going through at 
that time. Except for the occasional question on set, that was the only time 
they asked about us. Other than that, we just hung out. 
</P>
<P>
 When you think back to your ordeal, does it seem like it was just a dream? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah. If you think about it, you think, "It's already been a whole year. 
That's a long time." But then you think, "Man. It was yesterday." But it does 
seem like it was a dream. It is like it never really happened, but it really 
did. 
</P>
<P>
 Are you amazed at what you and Jennifer did to survive? 
</P>
<P>
 When you are put into such a traumatic position where the odds are against 
you, you kind of step back. Your mind steps back and your body sort of takes 
over. A lot of people have come up to me and said, "Oh, man. I could have never 
done that." And these are guys who look like they are in a lot better shape 
than I am in. I have said it to them a lot: "If I was in your shoes I would say 
the same thing because thinking about it, I would have never thought I could 
have done that or Jennifer either." 
</P>
<P>
 I think the whole time we made a lot of smart decisions. For what we had in 
the truck, we dressed about as well as you could probably dress for walking in 
the snow, with plastic around our feet. We had Clay bundled up and just little 
things we did here or there. Thinking about it now, I don't remember ever 
having to think, "Should we do this?" We just kind of did it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Snowbound: The Jim and Jennifer Stolpa Story" airs Sunday at 9 p.m. on CBS.

 Regarding Calendar's coverage of the top stories of 1993 (Dec. 26): 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem of Beavis and Butt-head's influence on children has been 
overlooked: the fallacious notion of the populace (adults and children alike) 
that all animated films and programs are for juveniles ("The Guys Who Drove a 
Bigger Wedge Between the Generations," by Chris Willman). 
</P>
<P>
 Many creations have used cartooning to create something of artistic or 
literary merit with adult themes: "Wait Till Your Father Gets Home," "Heavy 
Metal," "Fantasia," "American Pop," "The Simpsons." 
</P>
<P>
 "Beavis" was obviously designed for an adult and late-teen audience mature 
enough to understand it at the satirical level. It does air on MTV, after all, 
right after the gangsta videos and condom commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 JEFFREY FRIEND 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since I have but one child fast approaching 40, and am singularly devoid of 
grandchildren, my awareness of those nefarious nudniks Beavis and Butt-head has 
been mercifully marginal. But they merely typify a terrible trend of antisocial 
influence on deluded youth that began when rock 'n' roll oozed on the scene 
some 40 years ago! 
</P>
<P>
 James Thurber's memorable short story "The Greatest Man in the World" tells of 
Jackie Smurch, intrepid '30s aviator, who flew an incredible nonstop solo 
around the Earth in a broken-down monoplane but proved such a loudmouthed, 
amoral braggart that government officials hid him from an idolatrous populace, 
finally shoving him out of a high hotel window to an "accidental" death. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, Babe Ruth, privately a profane, alcoholic, gluttonous womanizer, 
was so keenly aware of his responsibility as a hero of American youth that he 
unfailingly projected an unsullied public image, like most of the legendary 
fliers, athletes and popular musicians of that era. 
</P>
<P>
 But today's teen idols, real or imaginary, are hampered neither by government 
supervision nor the pangs of conscience, more's the pity! 
</P>

<P>
 Your critics listed their Top 10 films of the year ("Moviegoers' Trip to 
Bountiful"), and with few exceptions, the choices were honorable. However, they 
failed to place Steven Soderbergh's "King of the Hill" on their lists, and I 
simply cannot understand why. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a magnificent, understated film adaptation of an A. E. Hotchner 
memoir, a small tale of one boy's knockabout life and survival during the Great 
Depression. It is as personal, moving and inspired as any film released in 
1993, and it is, finally, so much larger than its small scale, thanks to the 
universality of its story and the excellent production values. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year a handful of films are overlooked at Oscar time, likely because 
academy members just haven't gotten around to seeing them. I hope this letter 
will be the start of a campaign to re-release "King of the Hill" in more than a 
limited run, thereby catalyzing academy and public interest. That's the least I 
can do for a film that did so much for me.

 In his Top 10 list of 1993, Kenneth Turan reflected the typical condescending 
attitude facing Steven Spielberg when he calls "Schindler's List" "a surprise 
coming from (him)." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Spielberg's previous films might "merely" be considered 
entertainment, they are still reflections of a consummate, skilled 
professional. At least Spielberg, unlike Turan, has never condescended to his 
audience. His only goal has been to try to provide first-class productions, 
whatever their content. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatness of "Schindler's List" is that no matter how many people try to 
diminish Spielberg's accomplishment, its quality will long outshine most of the 
pretentious tripe on Turan's list.

 "Leolo" on two Top 10 lists? Yecch! Repeated shots of fat, middle-aged people 
on the john, a gang rape of a cat, masturbation into tomatoes and raw meat -- 
this is poetry?

 And whatever happened to "The Remains of the Day"? Too refined for the Top 10 
tastes?

 As usual, Martin Bernheimer has done a thorough job of presenting the 
Beckmesser Awards. However, I did notice one omission under "Jeers": 
</P>
<P>
 Sign()-of-The-Times award: To Sunday Calendar, which requires about 20 pages 
of advertisements to justify a related article. 
</P>
<P>
 This must be the explanation for the near-total absence of any feature writing 
on subjects related to classical music and dance.

RETRO; MOVING ON, AND ON, AND ON; ROBERT CONRAD TAKES HIS ROLES SERIOUSLY...AND 
LIGHTLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fans always ask Robert Conrad the same question: Can he still fit into the 
skin-tight pants he wore 30 years ago on the Western spoof "The Wild, Wild 
West"? 
</P>
<P>
 "The answer is yes," the 58-year-old Conrad says with a hearty laugh. "There 
were times in the last 28 years where I couldn't. But I have gotten myself to 
where I am happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Conrad played sexy James T. West, an undercover agent for President Ulysses S. 
Grant, on the series, which aired on CBS from 1965-69. The late Ross Martin 
played his sidekick and master of disguise, Artemus Gordon. The two traveled to 
their various assignments on a specially equipped railroad car. 
</P>
<P>
 Repeats of the series recently began on cable's TNT and Conrad couldn't be 
happier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think its deja vu with me," he says. "This is a hoot for me only because I 
remember some of the reviews. I remember all the producer changes. It was a 
unique show for me. The show that wasn't supposed to work, works. I feel like 
the battery I used to represent. I feel like the Energizer. I am going on and 
on and on." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross Martin, Conrad says affectionately, would be thrilled with the longevity 
of the "Wild West." "He was a unique guy who went way too early. I've always 
had a good feeling about this show in spite of all the producers. (Creator) 
Mike Garrison was fired and rehired and then died. Bruce Lansbury came in and 
he was such a good guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Off camera, Conrad admits, the series was chaos. "It was made in six days and 
their leading man had a tendency to party hard, party real hard. It was a tough 
shoot." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Conrad, Warner Bros., which just completed the film version of 
the classic TV Western "Maverick," has a "Wild West" theatrical feature in 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a very strong 'Wild West' fan club out of Indianapolis," he says. 
"Whomever does the role is going to be scrutinized by them." Though James 
Garner, who played Bret Maverick on the series, is appearing in the "Maverick" 
movie, Conrad isn't sure he'll be involved with the "Wild West" movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had opportunities to do the show again, conversations about doing it as 
a TV series again. But I wouldn't do it without Ross Martin. The bottom line is 
I would do the feature based on the material. I don't need the money and I 
wouldn't want to associate myself with something that really has become more 
important to me in its death than it ever was in its life." 
</P>
<P>
 Conrad says he was shocked when he landed the role of James West. He was the 
17th out of 18 actors auditioning for the role. 
</P>
<P>
 So how did he get the part? 
</P>
<P>
 "I have kind of an attitude on and off camera," Conrad acknowledges. "That's 
what they bought. The only guy being considered for the role I was concerned 
about never showed up. He was, and is, a man I admire, John Derek." 
</P>
<P>
 The series, he says, went off the air because of the pressure put on the 
network by former Democratic Sen. John Pastore, who deemed the series too 
violent. "I was in Rochester, N.Y., doing a Shriner's Crippled Children's 
(Hospital) benefit and got a call from the president of CBS. He said we are not 
going forward with the show. We had a 33 share!" 
</P>
<P>
 But Conrad thought it was time to move on. "Though I take acting lightly, 
sometimes I take it very seriously. It was time to move on and we did." 
</P>
<P>
 And Conrad has done quite well. Since "Wild West" was canceled, he's starred 
in the series "Black Sheep Squadron" (a.k.a. "Baa Baa Black Sheep") and "High 
Mountain Rangers. For the last 13 years, Conrad has had his own successful 
production company and produced and directed numerous TV movies. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most popular TV movies in which he starred and produced was the 
1985 thriller "Two Fathers," in which he played a macho steelworker who teams 
up with a stuffy executive (George Hamilton) to capture the man who murdered 
their children at a pre-wedding party. 
</P>
<P>
 The sequel, "Two Fathers: Justice for the Innocent," airs Friday on NBC. This 
time around, the dads team up again when the man escapes from prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "I play Stanley Kowalski in 'Two Fathers,' " Conrad says, laughing. "George 
Hamilton -- there is a very debonair dude. He has the perfect gray on the sides 
(of his hair). He has a magnificent suntan. There's a line in the movie where I 
say, "I am proud and 60.' It was written, 'We are proud and 60.' George said: 
'No. No. No.' So I changed the line. Now I say to George: 'I am pushing 60 and 
you are not too far away from Leisure World yourself.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "The Wild, Wild West" airs Saturdays at 7 and 8 a.m. on TNT; "Two Fathers: 
Justice for the Innocent" airs Friday at 9 p.m. on NBC.

IT'S HOTTER THAN EVER . . .HELL, ; AFTER YEARS OF NEGLECT, HADES IS MAKING A 
COMEBACK. BUT IT'S BEEN REMODELED A BIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just when it seemed safe to enter the afterlife, eternal damnation has 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
 That glowing light at the end of the tunnel, the story goes, might be a blast 
furnace. 
</P>
<P>
 Hell -- after practically vanishing from public thought in recent decades -- 
is making a comeback in a rush of new books, philosophical debates and accounts 
of near-death experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 It also has been remodeled. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Dante left, the place has been overhauled by everyone from Catholic 
priests and a Tennessee cardiologist to Far Side cartoonist Gary Larson. The 
result: a state of the art Hades with such innovations as constant 
psychological torment, a skyscraper-sized human popcorn popper, and unending 
Muzak and mimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Its location has changed, too. During the 1700s, scientists theorized that 
hell was on the sun or aboard a comet. Today, theologians believe it less a 
place than a spiritual state. Then again, it might be underneath western 
Siberia. In 1990, the wacky Weekly World News reported that Soviet engineers 
found hell there while drilling for oil. They allegedly sealed it off after 
smelling smoke and hearing the wails of the damned. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever and wherever it is, says historian Alan Bernstein, hell ranks as one 
of history's most influential concepts. 
</P>
<P>
 And one of its most misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The popular image of hell has next to nothing to do with the doctrine of it," 
says Father Augustine DeNoia, a theologian for the National Conference of 
Catholic Bishops: Not only is it flame-free, but people who go there do so by 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "God isn't some vindictive judge sending humans to a place of punishment," he 
explains, echoing the views of mainline Protestants and conservative 
evangelicals. "If that were the case, he would be a monster." 
</P>
<P>
 So, then, what is hell and who ends up there? That question has been argued 
for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest Christian thinking locates Hades in some sort of invisible 
dimension. If souls don't occupy space as we know it, theologians reason, 
neither does hell. 
</P>
<P>
 "It exists, but it's not a place," says Biola University philosophy professor 
J.P. Moreland, co-author of "Immortality: The Other Side of Death."  
</P>
<P>
 "It's like numbers. They're real, but no one knows where they are." 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, hell's pain is more spiritual than physical. "It's like the misery 
of a broken love," DeNoia says. "Suppose you marry a (superficially) very 
attractive man or woman, only to find out later that (he or she) married you 
just for your money. And suppose that, in order to marry this person, you gave 
up someone who really loved you. The pain you'd feel in knowing you chose the 
wrong person is what hell is like." 
</P>
<P>
 In the same way, he says, people who choose a life apart from God's love will 
spend eternity quarantined from him, knowing they made the wrong choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Can't they change their minds once they realize their mistake? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is complicated -- and controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 For starters, says Moreland, God wants people to choose him freely, which 
becomes impossible after death: "At that point, it's not really a choice to be 
with God. It's merely an attempt to avoid hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, people who end up in hell don't want to be with God. The decisions 
they've made in life and the kind of person they've become don't fit in with 
him, DeNoia says: "They'd be like fast-food addicts in a great French 
restaurant." 
</P>
<P>
 Hell hasn't always been so difficult to define. 
</P>
<P>
 In ancient Greece, the damned simply spent eternity lying face down in a swamp 
of mud and frogs. Later, Plato spoke of a place of "temporary punishment for 
the curably wicked and eternal punishment for the incurably wicked." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jewish concept of hell grew out of frustration with injustice, says 
Bernstein, a University of Arizona history professor who teaches a class on 
Hades and who wrote "The Formation of Hell," a newly released first volume of a 
planned hell trilogy. 
</P>
<P>
 It was obvious that people were getting away with sin in this life, he 
explains, so some Jews (around the 2nd Century BC) began looking for punishment 
in the next one. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Gehenna, named for a dump near Jerusalem where garbage and animal 
carcasses were cast into fires. Although not mentioned as an afterlife 
destination in Jewish scriptures (all the dead -- good and bad -- were 
consigned to a shadowy underworld called Sheol), Gehenna soon evolved into "a 
cosmic disposal site for the wicked," Bernstein says. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Christianity, however, that truly perfected hell and put it on the map. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the New Testament is surprisingly vague about the subject. The 
apostle Paul barely mentions it, and other references -- including statements 
by Jesus -- describe little more than a "lake of fire," "weeping and gnashing 
of teeth," "outer darkness" and a "worm that never dies." 
</P>
<P>
 Theologians, artists and writers fleshed out the details. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost immediately, Bernstein says, "people began trying to chip away at the 
absoluteness of eternal damnation." An early text called the Vision of Paul, 
for instance, describes a divine visit to hell in which Jesus gives the damned 
Sundays off in honor of his resurrection. 
</P>
<P>
 Origen of Alexandria, meanwhile, suggested in the 2nd Century that hell's 
torments and God's mercy would eventually lead everyone -- even Satan -- to 
redemption. Three centuries later, he was excommunicated by the Catholic church 
for his trouble, and "to make sure that he was properly serving his time, 
subsequent synods (of bishops) in 553, 680, 787 and 869 (also) damned him to 
eternal flames," says Alice K. Turner, fiction editor for Playboy magazine, in 
her new book, "The History of Hell." 
</P>
<P>
 With Origen disposed of, Hades sprang to life. 
</P>
<P>
 It became "like a hit Hollywood movie that gets remade over and over, each 
time catering to the tastes of a new audience," says one reviewer of Turner's 
survey. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jesuits, for instance, made hell "unbearably, suffocatingly, repulsively 
crowded . . . (with people) pressed together like grapes in a wine-press . . . 
(and) no latrines," Turner writes. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Catholic order, the Redemptorists, promised that anyone sent there 
would become "a furnace of fire. . . . If he touches, sees (or) breathes, he 
touches, sees (or) breathes only fire. He will be in fire like a fish in water. 
. . . His heart will burn in his bosom, his brains in his head, his blood in 
his veins, (and his) marrow in his bones." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein calls that the carrot-and-stick approach to salvation: Heaven was 
the reward, hell was the deterrent. "We may find that crass," he says. "But 
theologians in the Middle Ages readily admitted it. . . . Hell shaped people's 
decisions in all kinds of ways." 
</P>
<P>
 In modern times, however, hell has fallen from grace. Theologians have 
challenged its existence. Clergymen have dropped it from sermons. And Origen's 
theory of universal salvation seems more popular than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the 1990s, a hell renaissance seems to be taking shape. U.S. News & 
World Report ran a cover story on Hades in 1991. A Catholic bishop in New York 
recently warned Gov. Mario Cuomo of a "serious risk of going to hell" for 
supporting legalized abortion. And even the 1990 hit movie "Ghost" contained 
scenes of dark forces dragging evildoers off to unseen torment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the most powerful symbols in our collective psyches," Bernstein 
says. "Everyone knows what hell is, even if they don't believe in it." 
</P>
<P>
 But apparently, they do. According to a 1991 Gallup Poll, 60% of Americans 
believe in hell, up from 54% in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 Religious historian Martin Marty of the University of Chicago dismisses those 
results: "More people believe in hell than they did a few years ago, but that's 
because more people believe in everything than they did a few years ago -- 
angels, UFOs. . . . (The real test is whether) they do anything about the 
belief. If they think hell is real, they should be out there 21 hours a day 
trying to save people. But they aren't." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Gallup Poll found that only 4% of Americans think they're going to 
hell. 
</P>
<P>
 That may be because so many people are laughing about it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Far Side cartoons, the gates of hell have been transformed into a pair 
of doors (labeled "Damned If You Do" and "Damned If You Don't"), the coffee is 
always cold ("Oh man!" says one denizen, "They thought of everything!") and new 
inductees are greeted by the reminder: "Today is the first day of the rest of 
your life." 
</P>
<P>
 David Letterman, meanwhile, lists hell's "Top Ten Headlines," including "Most 
Residents Prefer Flame-Broiling to Frying," "Ice Water Canceled -- Again!" and 
"Authorities Announce: Everything to Feel 'Itchier.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another hell, described by Baltimore Sun columnist Kevin Cowherd, features 
accordion music piped in everywhere and mandatory attendance at daily mime 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the funniest depictions of Hades are in an unproduced screenplay 
making the rounds in Hollywood: Todd Durham's "Mr. Smith Goes to Hell." The 
gags include a Motel of the Damned with "Hawaii Five-O" on every channel, and a 
simple sign on the gates of hell: "Abandon hope, all ye who enter here. Do not 
back up, severe tire damage." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, a case can be made that Hades is being taken more seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 At least four books on the subject have come out since 1992, and U.S. News 
reports that some leading divinity schools are having a fresh look at hell. 
</P>
<P>
 Most intriguing, perhaps, are accounts of "near-death" experiences in which 
people brought back to life after "dying" describe journeys to hell. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary R. Habermas, a philosophy professor at evangelist Jerry Falwell's Liberty 
University in Lynchburg, Va., says he has investigated dozens of such stories. 
Habermas, co-author of "Immortality," says some people remember "finding 
themselves in a very confused state, either alone or with other spirits who 
were bewildered, depressed or in despair. (But) there is no torture and no evil 
beings." 
</P>
<P>
 Others describe a more classical hell: "A lake of fire with demons who whip 
them and make them carry around piles of bricks or other meaningless loads." 
</P>
<P>
 Habermas says Tennessee cardiologist Maurice Rawlings, who also has written on 
the subject, reports witnessing patients wake up on the operating table 
screaming that they were in hell. But when he asks them about it several days 
later, they've forgotten the experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on that, Rawlings estimates that up to two-thirds of people revived from 
clinical death may be repressing a hell experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Most near-death researchers don't accept Rawlings' numbers, Habermas says, but 
none question that some people have taken post-mortem journeys to hell. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists, however, argue that a physiological mechanism triggers all 
near-death episodes. Habermas disputes that theory (he says it doesn't explain 
how blind people revived from death correctly describe colors and other visual 
details in operating rooms), but concedes that visions of heaven or hell appear 
to be shaped by cultural factors. 
</P>
<P>
 Author Carol Zaleski's scholarly analysis of near-death journeys in medieval 
times, for example, found a strong emphasis on the torments of hell, apparently 
a reflection of religious beliefs in that era. 
</P>
<P>
 And so the debate continues. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest argument, a sort of updated take on Origen, several prominent 
theologians have sharply attacked the doctrine that hell's sufferings last 
forever. 
</P>
<P>
 A deity who would allow eternal torment is "more nearly like Satan than like 
God," one evangelical suggests. "It would amount to inflicting infinite 
suffering upon those who have committed finite sin. It would go far beyond an 
eye for an eye."  
</P>
<P>
 The solution? God eventually snuffs out of existence everyone in hell. In 
support of this view, "annihilationists" cite New Testament passages about a 
"second death" and Jesus' warning to "not be afraid of (men), who can kill the 
body but not the soul. Rather, be afraid of (God), who can destroy both soul 
and body in hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionalists counter with other Bible passages and insist that God would 
never destroy his own creations.  
</P>
<P>
 Even historian Bernstein, who is Jewish, says scholarly attempts to water down 
the doctrine of hell are misguided: "What are you going to do? Say Jesus didn't 
mean it (when he talked about hell)? Or that his statements are falsely 
attributed to him? . . . (And what about the Book of Revelation), which talks 
about a lake of fire and brimstone and 'the smoke of their torment will rise 
forever and ever and they will not rest?' I don't know how else to interpret 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Alan W. Gomes, a Biola University professor, agrees. "If we gladly embrace 
(Christ's) teachings when he speaks words of comfort and of life, must we not 
also receive, with all due solemnity, (his teachings about) judgment, perdition 
and hell?" Gomes asked in a recent issue of Christian Research Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Bernstein: "If every king has his palace and every palace has its 
dungeon," then Christianity's dungeon has to be hell. Global Visions of Hell 
</P>
<P>
 In one form or another, hell figures into the beliefs of almost every major 
world religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Hinduism: Souls on the way to reincarnation must first stop off in one of 21 
Hindu hells to be purged of bad karma. Among the tortures: getting cooked in a 
jar or eaten by crows. 
</P>
<P>
 Islam: Given this faith's harsh temporal punishments, one might expect a 
particularly horrendous Hades. Instead, Muslim hell is remarkably similar to 
other abodes of the damned. After death, each soul must follow the Path, a 
narrow bridge leading to Paradise. Those who are judged unworthy fall off into 
a crater of fire. Some believe that the flames are literal; others consider 
them figurative, says Maher Hathout, chairman of the Islamic Center of Southern 
California. The Koran doesn't say whether hell is eternal. 
</P>
<P>
 Buddhism: Tibetan Buddhism lists eight cold hells, while Classical Buddhism 
speaks of seven hot ones -- complete with torture chambers, flaming pits and 
quagmires. Buddhists don't believe in souls, so the torments are experienced by 
a person's five senses. 
</P>
<P>
 Jainism: This Hindu spin-off might hold the record for most hells -- 8.4 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Judaism: Until the 18th and 19th centuries, Hades was a common fixture in 
Jewish religious thought. Although Hebrew scriptures didn't specifically 
mention a place of eternal punishment, rabbinical tradition from about 200 BC 
forward developed an elaborate concept of afterlife torment called Gehenna. 
Early literature depicted sinners boiling in human excrement or being flayed 
and burned; later interpretations allegorized the threat, says Richard Hecht, a 
religious studies professor at UC Santa Barbara. In the 1700s, philosophers 
began arguing that hell didn't conform to the idea of a merciful God. Today, 
with the exception of Judaism's Orthodox branch, Jews have abandoned the ideas 
of hell and an afterlife.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: FOR AIDS PATIENTS -- WITH LOVE, AUNT BEE'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aunt Bee's is not one of the glitzier stops on the AIDS charity circuit. It's 
a bare-bones thrift store along a fairly dingy stretch of Santa Monica 
Boulevard near Gower Street in Hollywood. The prices are great, though, which 
is why the place is bustling on a midweek afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the used clothes and household effects are some unusual finds: a flouncy 
chiffon gown once owned by Peggy Lee; a pair of hand-painted kimonos stitched 
with 14-karat gold thread. 
</P>
<P>
 But those touches are not what makes Aunt Bee's so special. What separates 
Aunt Bee's from other secondhand stores is what goes on in the back, behind the 
stacks of used linens, mismatched porcelain and old toasters. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven days a week, three washing machines and a commercial dryer vibrate and 
hum as volunteers sort, wash and fold the laundry of people too sick to do it 
for themselves: people dying of AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have lost a lot of friends to AIDS," said Miki Jackson, 42, a longtime 
political activist and graphic designer who founded Aunt Bee's and serves as 
its executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 "And one thing I know from taking care of people in the last stages is, you 
stand in front of the washing machine all day, because people get horrible 
sweats, and they get incontinent at times, and they just make a mass of 
laundry." 
</P>
<P>
 All of the store's merchandise is donated; the aim, eventually, is to cover 
the rent and other expenses with sales. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a decidedly unglamorous way to serve a needy population. Said Jackson: 
"We can't promise anyone parties with movie stars." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To claim the operation is without pizazz, though, would be disingenuous. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, singer Peggy Lee heads Aunt Bee's honorary board of directors. And 
Lee was responsible not only for recruiting singer Johnny Mathis, interior 
designer Mario Buatta and composer Cy Coleman to the honorary board, she also 
secured a $10,000 donation from the foundation of her late friend, tobacco 
heiress Doris Duke. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peggy Lee thought the laundry was the greatest idea," Jackson said. "She got 
it right away. I mean, she grew up in North Dakota and knows what it's like to 
do wash." 
</P>
<P>
 Jaime Vidales, on the other hand, never did a load of wash until he was a 
grown man. Now, however, he spends every Tuesday afternoon at Aunt Bee's, 
making his way through anywhere from six to nine loads. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always wanted to help, to do some kind of volunteer work," said Vidales, 
38. "And I know this sounds corny, but I do it because it feels good." 
</P>
<P>
 Aunt Bee's, modeled on a 5-year-old service in San Diego called Auntie Helen's 
Fluff 'n Fold, serves about 40 clients. Jackson hopes to triple the number in 
the next few months, once she replaces the trio of home-style washers with 
industrial machines. 
</P>
<P>
 It took Jackson and many others, including gay-rights activist Morris Kight, 
nearly two years to raise the $12,000 it took to open Aunt Bee's. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any project with plumbing is real expensive," Jackson said. "It's not like 
support groups and help lines, where all you need is a desk and a telephone. If 
there is such a thing as a volunteer plumber, I have never heard of one." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson has no trouble finding folks to help with laundry and thrift-store 
duties -- there are about 30 regular volunteers -- but very few are interested 
or able to pick up and deliver the laundry. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are so grass roots and shoestring it's ridiculous," Jackson said, "but we 
have scrimped and saved and begged enough that we will be able to hire someone 
to pick up and deliver loads two or three days a week."  
</P>
<P>
 Such victories may not seem like much in the great scheme of the war on AIDS, 
but they make a critical difference in a place like Aunt Bee's. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It takes a few minutes for Joe Popenoe, who turned 35 on Friday, to get to the 
phone. Sick with AIDS for the last two years, he is quite weak and unable to 
care for himself. He has been a client of Aunt Bee's for several months, ever 
since reading about the laundry service in a magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he contacted Aunt Bee's, Popenoe said, he didn't do laundry at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wore the same dirty clothes for a long time," he said. "I just wasn't 
strong enough to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said Aunt Bee's and Auntie Helen's are the only formal laundry 
services she knows of for people with AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 That's hard to believe, really, considering the number of people with AIDS -- 
more than 8,000 in Los Angeles County alone. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Jackson pointed out: "It's one of those services that is so obvious 
that no one sees it." 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, that is.

 Dave and Pamela Healey weren't expecting twins. In fact, they'd bought tiny 
singles of everything in 1985, when their doctor suddenly informed them -- 
three weeks before the birth -- that they would be seeing double. Dave, a 
documentary photographer whose work has appeared in Newsweek and Time, recalled 
that he was scheduled to go to Haiti on assignment, "and I knew this would put 
a damper on my trip." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the day they were born, however, Megan and Danielle have been the 
favorite objects in the eye of their father's camera. 
</P>
<P>
 The 50-year-old photographer has approached the documentation of his 
daughters' growth with a zeal usually reserved for his professional projects. 
The images on this page show that it has developed far beyond that of the 
average parent with an Instamatic. When the girls were about 2, for example, he 
did a series of their body parts: baby eyes, ears, toes. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the period when the Healeys, like most new parents, "inspected our 
kids every day, to make sure no weird rashes or odd growths had sprouted 
overnight." 
</P>
<P>
 The photographer, who lives on the Westside, said he quickly realized that 
this would be a long-term commitment. "On most projects, I have a time limit; 
this one is timeless. I don't know where it will take me or when it will end." 
</P>
<P>
 In an age of video cameras and glitzy color, he chose only black and white 
stills. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a piece of time, captured on paper," he said. "I like the subtlety of 
the black and white tones, and the prints are more stable; they can potentially 
last 400 years, whereas even the best color material will fade. I try for 
prints that many generations will enjoy, just as I enjoy looking at photos of 
my ancestors, which have survived intact from the 1800s." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Megan and Danielle can't see beyond the moment. They only know it's 
fun being "snapped," whether they're waiting with their noses pressed against 
the screen for Daddy to come home or running through a tunnel under the Santa 
Monica Freeway. (He used to take them there so they could yell their lungs out 
and then hear their echoes.) 
</P>
<P>
 At about age 4, while out for a walk, they saw a "fat" woman and their parents 
explained about pregnancy. When they got balloons later that day, the twins 
pretended that they too were "with child." When they got chicken pox, their 
daddy photographed their spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Healey hopes his pictures will bring joy. But "it's certainly giving them lots 
of fun now. They love when I take pictures and they see themselves in the 
results." BETTIJANE LEVINE

THE BUZZ: HAPPY MONEY . . . ER, HONEY MOON, KIDS! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hello, young lovers, we know where you are: Newly married billionaire Bill 
Gates (of software giant Microsoft) and bride Melinda French have been 
honeymooning this week in a remote spot some computer hackers probably couldn't 
even find: the tiny private Fiji island of Wakaya. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing host to the couple is the exclusive Wakaya Club resort, which charges 
$875 per couple per day. 
</P>
<P>
 For that, the pair gets a 1,500-square-foot cottage and three squares a day 
(we'd guess snacks, too), plus all the golf, scuba diving, snorkeling, tennis 
and speed boating they can cram into a week. 
</P>
<P>
 So what have the newlyweds been up to? With that kind of money, anything they 
want. Adding Kick: What was so riveting at the Chanel cosmetics counter, we 
wondered as we walked through the doors of Bullock's Century City. Two 
saleswomen stood in front of the counter, their eyes fixed on a small 
television set. 
</P>
<P>
 Were they watching a demonstration of a miracle cream that will simultaneously 
plump up crow's-feet and turn your cellulite into taut muscle? A new lipstick 
that will give you an instant Claudia Schiffer pout? No, it was . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "A Bruce Lee movie," said one of the saleswomen, smiling. "We had a Fred 
Astaire movie on before, but we thought we'd put this on for a little variety." 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see . . . Bruce Lee, Chanel cosmetics . . . yeah, we see a connection, 
sure. Wordy Workout: Here are popular exercises we've noticed lately at some 
L.A. gyms: whining and arguing with trainers. Maybe it burns calories, who 
knows? 
</P>
<P>
 A recent example: "Look," said a young woman slumped against the wall, "you 
have to take it really easy on me right now. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "Well you have to take it easy on me," her trainer barked back. "You can't do 
this to me, you can't miss four appointments in row." 
</P>
<P>
 Another trainer was lecturing his client on the importance of good nutrition. 
The client, who had a substantial girth, replied, "I swear to God, all I have 
in the morning is a bagel, that's all I have. Then I have a tuna melt for lunch 
. . . but I don't eat all the fries."

 What do you have on your night stand? 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Stanley Frileck, Brentwood plastic surgeon, president of the UCLA Plastic 
Surgery Society.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have tons of stuff. I keep a lot of books there, I'm in the middle of 10 
books all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also keep a sketch pad in my drawer. What I do is basically designer 
surgery. When people come in thinking they need a face lift or an eye lift, 
it's usually never that simple. So I design variations on certain procedures. 
Sometimes I get stuck, I can't quite figure out what to do, and ideas often 
come to me around midnight, 1 in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also keep an old breast implant in my drawer -- I use it as a paperweight. 
It's made of silicone gel, I've had it about four or five years. It's one of 
the textured kind, they're very good paperweights." 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Ausgang, artist . 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, my night stand is actually an old Eatmore Apple crate from the 1930s. 
On it, there's an old stove timer that I've turned into my reading lamp, a 
cheesy traveler's clock I bought on Canal Street and, for protection, your 
standard knife. There's also a bizarre-looking heater that looks like an NFL 
face mask but I turned that into my love light. You gotta have a love light by 
the bed." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonnie Kyle, general manager of Bulgari, Beverly Hills . 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a little duomo clock from Bulgari that's about 3 1/2 inches high. And 
I have a little guardian angel to look over me that someone gave me when I 
joined Bulgari. It's darling, it's just precious. I believe in it -- I believe 
its powers are working. And I think that in 1994 its powers are going to be 
working even more. Then I have my phone, with two lines. I couldn't do without 
it. I'm always on the phone, to New York, to Europe. And then a pad because I'm 
always making notes. I only sleep four or five hours a night, that's all I 
need." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Flanagan, poet, artist, performance artist , much of whose work deals with 
the experience of having cystic fibrosis.  
</P>
<P>
 A back scratcher, a bronchial dilator, ear plugs, blindfold, clothes pins . . 
. well, sometimes these things get scattered around the room and are not on the 
night stand. Oh, yeah, there's a Japanese alarm clock that, instead of an 
alarm, has a domineering male voice that screams, '1 . . . 2 . . . 3 . . . WAKE 
UP!' " 
</P>
<P>
 James Beriker, co-owner of Rustica restaurant in Beverly Hills . 
</P>
<P>
 "In a way, my bedside is pretty representative of who I am and where I'm 
going. I have a stack of old menus that I've collected over the years, probably 
from about 1974, 1975. There are menus from my father's (Kermin Beriker) 
restaurants that he created, one from a bistro in Paris and old Spago menus 
from when my brother was there. I just love them. I love to think of the 
thought processes that went into them. I look at everything, the four corners, 
the writing, even the food stains. They help me think about our own menus." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Salter, owner, Hollywood Athletic Club:  
</P>
<P>
 "My god, I'd have to take a look. The TV Guide, for sure. A glass of purified 
tap water, photographs of my grandchildren and whatever I'm reading currently 
-- "Lasher," that's Anne Rice, "The Tibetan Book of Living and Dying" and 
another mystical book of writings by Oscar Ichazo. My watch, a pen, a telephone 
-- nothing really." 
</P>
<P>
 Beck, singer/songwriter  
</P>
<P>
 "Some raspberries, a hatchet, a home pregnancy test, the L.A. Times and a 
Zippo lighter." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Magnin, owner Polo/Ralph Lauren, Beverly Hills:  
</P>
<P>
 "You want a whole list? A Tiffany clock, lots of reading material on food and 
wine, two Peter Mayle books on Provence that I've already read but I like to 
look through to remind myself how great it is there, and an antique alligator 
portfolio for no other reason than it looks good."

THE VERSES THAT SERMONS RARELY QUOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times article concerning the upsurge in Bible reading ("Hitting the Book," 
Dec. 22) prompted me to list for the new readers a partial selection of Bible 
verses seldom mentioned in sermons. 
</P>
<P>
 II Kings 19:35: God sends an angel to slaughter 185,000 human beings in one 
night. 
</P>
<P>
 II Kings 2:23-24: God sends two bears out of the forest to kill 42 children. 
</P>
<P>
 Numbers 16:27-35: God buries alive mothers and their children and then burns 
up the fathers. 
</P>
<P>
 Numbers 31:17-18: Moses tells an army to kill all male children and all 
non-virgins and to keep all the virgins and girl children for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Luke 12:47-48: Jesus advises that the proper way to punish slaves is with a 
severe beating. 
</P>
<P>
 I Corinthians 11:7: A man is the image and glory of God, but a woman is only 
the glory of man.

 Atheists, of whom I am one, recommend wholeheartedly that people read the 
Bible. It is an important factor in the history of the United States and some 
familiarity with it is necessary to understand much of what goes on in our 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 But what is offered in Bible study classes is intended to support those 
religions that use the Bible in its various versions. There is no critical 
inquiry into what is being studied, because the Bible is taken as ultimate 
authority, not to be questioned. What is learned is the doctrinal bias of the 
study leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, read and study the Bible, but don't let someone else tell you what he 
thinks it says.

SOME RELIEF FOR COMPUTER USERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding Samantha Greenberg and the Computer Injury Network, it is not only 
employers who contribute to this problem ("Success Puts the Bite on Computer 
Injury Network" (Dec. 29). Equally at fault are manufacturers who, for example, 
ignore the fact that a 6-foot-tall man weighing 200 pounds may have a different 
touch on a computer keyboard than a 5-foot-tall woman who weighs 100 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 This problem happened to me at work recently when my new Macintosh computer 
came with a keyboard that required a ham-fisted touch. I am a writer who 
frequently spends eight-hour days on the keyboard under deadline pressures. 
Within an hour, I was suffering severe pain in my fingers and hands, and 
neither Macintosh nor any of the other companies I contacted could offer a 
solution to my problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, I learned that Key Tronic makes a rubber dome kit for its 
Macintosh-compatible extended keyboard, which makes it possible to adjust the 
keyboard touch from two or three ounces to one or two. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope this information will be of help to others -- and that it will inspire 
computer manufacturers to provide more user-friendly variation in their 
products.

SUICIDE SURVEY IS NO SURPRISE TO HER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The article "Study Says Blacks, Women May Be Concealing Suicide" (Dec. 28) did 
not come as a surprise. As a highly educated 62-year-old woman, I have been 
virtually unemployed for more than 20 years.I raised children and then, I 
thought, it would be my turn to get an education and make money and feel 
worthwhile. Nobody ever took me seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 No one would suspect that this seemingly jolly and perky gray-haired clown 
contemplates suicide every now and again. I am a hospital volunteer and I work 
long hours at a hospice. It is wonderful that I have something to do, but when 
it comes time for Social Security, I will get the minimum. But worst of all, 
I'll get no respect. I will be a faceless elderly woman who never did anything 
except "be a housewife." By society's standards, that's worth nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 People commit suicide because they feel they no longer matter to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 When we see 25-year-old women replacing seasoned middle-aged women on 
television, what are we to think? 
</P>
<P>
 When black people see mostly white people on television, what are they to 
think? 
</P>
<P>
 They think just as it really is: The world is made for young, white people. If 
you don't fall into this category, you do not count.

EVERYONE'S BUYING 'EVERYONE POOPS,' A SURPRISE HOT SELLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the hot-selling books regionally and across the country is about -- 
well -- poop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone Poops" (Kane/Miller, $11.95), the work of Japanese author and 
illustrator Taro Gomi, has become an unexpected favorite among kids and adults 
alike. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows people and animals, and everyone is doing basically the same thing," 
said Daria Dimitroff, a salesperson at Children's Book World in West Los 
Angeles. "It's not a title we'd normally suggest . . . but the book actually 
sells itself. We've got other books by Taro Gomi, but they don't sell nearly as 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 Kane/Miller Book Publishers, a small family-owned publisher with offices in La 
Jolla and New York, printed 20,000 copies of the 28-page illustrated book in 
October. The company rushed a second printing of 20,000 copies when the first 
sold out. A third printing of at least 40,000 copies will be completed this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Madeline Kane, Kane/Miller co-owner with her brother, Sandy Miller, is 
mystified by the book's popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it would do pretty good," said Kane, whose firm specializes in 
children's books from other countries. "But it's been phenomenal for us. A 
good-selling book will do about 10,000 copies in a year, and this has sold 
40,000 since October." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the book is intended for children of toilet-training age, it's also 
great for adults who have to answer those questions, said Karin Soderberg, a 
nurse with Kaiser Permanente in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Soderberg bought one copy for two nephews who are toilet-training. Doctors and 
nurses at Kaiser's pediatric gastroenterology unit use a copy to help explain 
bowel movements and gastrointestinal ailments to children. Kane said the book 
is being used in nursery schools and to help children with learning 
disabilities to better understand their bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 The book has had other, unintended uses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes the kids who are getting chemotherapy treatment laugh because it's 
funny," Soderberg said. "It's also a great conversation piece. I had it in the 
elevator the other day, and three doctors who I don't even know were grabbing 
it to read." 
</P>
<P>
 Sales are "pretty much split between parents buying it for (toilet-training) 
kids and adults buying it for other adults," said Dave Valvoda, assistant 
manager of the Nature Company store in Century City. "People see it and say, 
'This is so neat or cute.' I can't keep it in stock." 
</P>
<P>
 The politely illustrated book is "a beginning science book that really 
addresses the needs and interests of the very young child," Kane said.  
</P>
<P>
 Gomi specializes in children's books that have become known for their colorful 
and bold illustrations. Gomi's technique "is just perfect for this particular 
title," Kane said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although "Everyone Poops" is definitely a kids' book, it has also found an 
audience among adults. The San Francisco Chronicle's Herb Caen mentioned the 
book in a recent column. Alan Cheuse, a book reviewer in Washington, D.C., told 
National Public Radio's Noah Adams that the cover sells itself: "It's one of 
those titles that tells you everything you need to know about the book." 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Times review in June noted that "Taro Gomi's title says it all, 
and the illustrations show it. There's no puritanical, lips-pursed, 
grin-and-bear-it earnestness about the story." 
</P>
<P>
 A second title in a planned series on children and their bodies -- "The Holes 
in Your Nose," by another Japanese author -- will be published in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Kane was taken aback by adult interest in the book. "We knew we would do 
really well in the nursery school realm," Kane said. "But we were totally 
shocked at adults buying it for other adults . . . . I really don't know how to 
explain it. It's not normally something people would talk about." In the same 
vein, there's also "Nature Calls," a book of wildlife photographs by Mitsuaki 
Iwago, which includes a cautionary note that "the elimination habits of animals 
. . . may be offensive to some readers." 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows animals doing their thing," said Valvoda of the Nature Company. "At 
first we were really worried that people would complain. But I've been stunned. 
. . . I can't believe the number of people who've bought multiple copies of 
this thing."

STARRING IN THE LIVING DRAMA OF LANGUAGE; CULTURE: A TEACHER STIRS UP PASSION 
FOR SPANISH, SAYING 'THE BRIDGE BETWEEN PEOPLES WILL BEGIN WITH SIMPLE SPEECH 
AND GROW TO MUTUAL UNDERSTANDING.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA MERRILL, THE CHRISTIAN SCIENCE MONITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once a week I get to step into the limelight. Each Monday evening, from 7 
until 9, I become the focus of an audience of 15 or so adults. A large city 
high school is my theater, and a classroom is my stage. I teach Spanish to 
Americans, and the performance is both challenging and fun. 
</P>
<P>
 I spend the week between each class preparing the evening's material and 
gathering my props. A few weeks ago we were learning the names of household 
items, so I carried in a bagful of my children's doll-house furniture. I handed 
these out piece by piece to my students and then began to give them their cues 
in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carlos," I said as he held up a miniature sofa, "ask Amelia what this is." 
</P>
<P>
 And Amelia answered, also in Spanish and almost amazed that she could do so, 
"It is a sofa from the living room." ( "Es un sofa de la sala!" ) 
</P>
<P>
 This was just our second week, and we had eight more weeks in the development 
of our drama. 
</P>
<P>
 In this classroom, the challenge for me lies in conveying the satisfaction of 
speaking in a language that is both powerfully emotive and rhythmically 
sublime. Simply conjugating present tense verbs or reading dialogues, I find, 
is a pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 But I don't let this experience be limited to just me. 
</P>
<P>
 Within 10 minutes of the first class, I start everybody speaking and insist 
that each student enter into the living drama of the language. As a student of 
John Rassias, a well-known Dartmouth College language professor, I was taught 
an intensive language method, in which the language classroom is not merely 
pedantic, but interactive and intensely personal. Language is not to be a 
textbook artifact, but an immediate experience. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Rassias method, the language teacher engages the class almost 
constantly in a rapid-fire exchange that forces students to begin to think in 
the new language instead of translating into the native language first. 
Grammar, dialogues, and new vocabulary are "drilled" into students, with the 
teacher providing the changing cues. 
</P>
<P>
 Although I may not rip the buttons off my shirt, as Professor Rassias has been 
known to do when demonstrating a verb of anger, I find myself leading a 
treasure hunt to teach prepositions ( "Mire debajo de la silla de Maria" -- 
"Look under Maria's chair") or maybe driving an autobus . Or maybe we will 
drink Cuban coffee as we practice the right response to cafe repartee. And 
always, I am moving, like a pasodoble dancer, back and forth amid the desks to 
get up close to everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 I use the distinctive Rassias finger-pointing drill method for about half of 
my Spanish classes, and incorporate it with English explanations, cultural 
information, games, and small scenes to act out. 
</P>
<P>
 I always start out my Spanish classes with a short but pithy prologue, 
conscious now of my pedagogical responsibilities. My adult students these past 
two years have been, for the most part, planning exciting trips to Spain or 
Mexico or one of the other 18 Spanish-speaking countries. They come eagerly to 
the first class, assuming that they will sit back and listen to a teacher. They 
also assume that their need for Spanish is only temporary and of the purely 
touristic type. 
</P>
<P>
 In my opening remarks, I give them my most impressive facts: That Los Angeles 
is the second-largest Spanish-speaking city in the world (which elicits mild 
surprise); that there are presently 25 million Latinos in the United States 
(the blunt numbers begin to raise some eyebrows); and that by the middle of the 
next century, almost half of the U.S. population will be Spanish speaking (it 
is this figure that causes the students to sit up straight in their small 
wooden desks and start to gape). 
</P>
<P>
 What I want, of course, is to impress upon my students the daily relevance 
that Spanish will have in their lives. And how the bridge between peoples will 
begin with simple speech and grow to mutual understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 These realities create a sense of immediacy. 
</P>
<P>
 No one is allowed to be uninvolved in my Spanish class, nor does shyness have 
a chance. If I am the lead performer, my students are my backups. 
</P>
<P>
 In a simplistic dialogue using subjects, verbs, and eventually adjectives, we 
converse. And because I tell my students that the learning of a new language as 
an adult is a kind of regression to childlike simplicity, we laugh a lot as we 
struggle through the rudiments of asking each other, "How are you?" ( "Como 
esta ?" ) or "What time do you eat in the morning? ( "A que hora comes en la 
man ana?" ). 
</P>
<P>
 I begin to notice observers from other, more sedate classes down the hall 
standing at our doorway. I realize that other classroom doors begin to close as 
our loud noises and sometimes hysterical laughter escape. My students, often 
tired from a day's activity, usually drag themselves into the classroom, 
probably wondering why they are not home reclining. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, without warning, they are given new Latin identities. They mingle at 
a imaginary Spanish airport or are blindfolded and directed by their 
classmates, all in Spanish ( "dos pasos a la derecha" -- "two steps to the 
right") through a classroom maze of desks. They might even figure out math 
problems in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Week by week, the stories start to emerge. Spanish, my students find with 
surprise, has begun to affect their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Amelia tells us of the patient in her hospital who spoke no English and found 
her helpful. Elodia has some Salvadoran children in her day-care center whose 
parents speak no English, and, in addition, her son is engaged to a young 
Peruvian woman. Elodia makes real contact with all these people. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos, a building contractor in Washington, D.C., works alongside Mexicans on 
a job and can give some direction. Jose sees a sign at his local gas station 
advertising "Latino Landscaping" and decides to call. Marcos and Mario have 
business contacts in South America, and now they feel they can start to make a 
deeper connection. Teresa tells of watching the movie "Lonesome Dove" and 
understanding a Spanish phrase. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the classroom itself, I start to see the barriers break down. My 
students soon leave behind their diverse professional and social roles and 
become Barbara Ana and Marialinda and Carlos to each other. Struggling to 
express where they are from in Spanish ( "Soy de Nueva York" ) or what the 
weather's like, they find camaraderie. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, two students who seem to be opposites are teasing each other in Spanish. 
Carlos, in his 40s, is a stout nonconformist who wears a black leather jacket, 
blue jeans and T-shirts with punch lines. He always sits up front, ready to 
attempt any dramatic scene. Winston, in his 60s, is aristocratic and 
immaculately attired. Reserved in demeanor, he prefers the farthest seat in the 
back, behind his wife, where he can pretend to just observe, always acting 
surprised when I call upon him regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos' idea of a great vacation is motorcycling with his girlfriend (also his 
seatmate) from Maryland to Mexico, finding the cheapest lodging all the way. 
Winston will insist upon a multi-starred hotel on his upcoming trip to Spain, 
with hot water that runs regularly from his own bathroom tap. 
</P>
<P>
 That these two opposites have found friendship across the room in Spanish 
class is part of the weekly promise that makes my teaching full of unexpected 
developments. When Carlos gave Winston his favorite pocket-sized book, "Wicked 
Spanish," for use in Spain, it had the class in gales. I realized that our 
speaking Spanish has broken through class barriers, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Trips abroad are still the focus as we learn how to give a tip in Spanish or 
choose a hotel room, but perhaps more importantly, my students have found the 
Spanish presence that is really all around them once they can decipher the 
alien sounds. In the course catalogue, this class is listed as "Conversational 
Spanish 101," and to converse, I tell my student-actors, only takes two people. 
It takes student and teacher or student and student, Spanish-speaker and 
English-speaker. To communicate is the point; all that follows is, like an 
encore, pure enjoyment.

REP. HARMAN PLANNING TO MOVE OUT OF MARINA; POLITICS: CONGRESSAN'S BID TO BUY 
AN ESTATE IN ROLLING HILLS DRAWS CRITICISM FROM CONTENDER WHO WANTS TO UNSEAT 
HER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM KOWSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Jane Harman (D-Marina del Rey) said last week she is negotiating to buy 
an ocean-view estate in Rolling Hills, an exclusive, gated community with one 
of the highest per capita incomes in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman, whose residency has been an issue since before her election in 1992, 
came under fire last year when she moved her two youngest children to the 
nation's capital to be closer to them. Her prospective purchase of a home in a 
community where only residents and their guests are allowed drew further 
criticism last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not trying to say Rolling Hills is a bad place," said Rancho Palos Verdes 
Mayor Susan Brooks, who has launched a campaign for Harman's job. "But it's not 
the real world. It's insulated, it's got the security . . . and will allow her 
to go home and not deal with the public." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Harman said she is not trying to insulate herself from her constituents. She 
and her husband became interested in Rolling Hills, she said, because they want 
a larger lot. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-bedroom house, which sits on seven acres, once had an asking price of 
more than $3 million. It would replace the home in Marina del Rey that the 
congresswoman shares with her husband, Sidney Harman, an audio equipment 
manufacturer, and their children, 9 and 11. 
</P>
<P>
 The Harmans have made an offer on the Rolling Hills property, which has a 
tennis court, but are still negotiating with the owners over such issues as 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 If an agreement on the house is reached, Harman and her husband will keep 
their $1.8-million home in Washington but plan to sell their $2-million Marina 
del Rey house, which, she said, has "no land whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "What Palos Verdes has to offer is a reasonable amount of land," Harman said. 
"It's quiet, and it's the kind of place where I think our family could hang 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Rolling Hills is an incorporated city of about 600 homes and a City Hall in 
the heart of the Palos Verdes Peninsula. It has no businesses or industry and a 
per capita income of more than $150,000. The only other city in Southern 
California with as high a per capita income is Hidden Hills in the western San 
Fernando Valley, according to the 1990 U.S. Census, which does not record 
incomes that exceed $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Rolling Hills lies within Harman's 36th Congressional District, which 
stretches from Marina del Rey to San Pedro, the prospective purchase is not 
likely to quiet opponents who contend that Harman is tied more closely to 
Washington than to the district she represents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Harmans, who have lived on both coasts since 1980, made Marina del Rey 
their primary residence two years ago. Before that, they owned a home in 
Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1992 election, opponent Los Angeles City Councilwoman Joan Milke 
Flores frequently portrayed Harman as a carpetbagging outsider who moved to the 
area solely to run for office. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks has continued to sound the theme despite Harman's protestations that 
she made 31 trips to the district last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks, in a campaign newsletter published by Carpetbagger Press, wrongly 
reports that Harman has already purchased a mansion in Rolling Hills and 
suggests as a housewarming gift "Maps of the South Bay." 
</P>
<P>
 "She's not moving in," Brooks added. "The only one who's going to live there 
is the butler." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks, who lives in a three-bedroom, 2,000-square-foot tract house in Rancho 
Palos Verdes, says Harman's interest in Rolling Hills shows "she's not down 
with the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Harman said that is nonsense. "The residents of Rolling Hills are friendly, 
down-to-earth people. It's not the part of Palos Verdes with the fanciest homes 
-- not by a long shot."

WESTSIDE WATCH: ON DANCER, ON PRANCER, ON COMET -- ON GERTRUDE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pssst: We have a dirty little holiday secret to share, and when it shows up in 
the supermarket tabloids, remember where you saw it first: One of Santa's 
reindeer has had a sex-change operation. 
</P>
<P>
 We noticed over the holidays that one of the reindeer pulling Santa's sleigh 
above the intersection of Wilshire and Little Santa Monica boulevards in 
Beverly Hills was missing its antlers. 
</P>
<P>
 Our first guess was that this was simply another manifestation of the decaying 
infrastructure in Beverly Hills. A check with the Chamber of Commerce, which 
handles the city's holiday decorations, revealed, however, that one of the 
bucks had been transformed into a doe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to take the antlers off one of the deer so there would be at least one 
female there," said Bill Boyd, the chamber's executive vice president. "This is 
in response to political correctness. . . . I would not be surprised if next 
year we don't have a 50-50 mix." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyd said the decision to have female representation grew out of an "informal 
discussion" about political correctness with the chamber staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "A majority of the staff of the chamber is women, so that influenced the 
decision," he said. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 A twofer: The election year has quickly sprung to life in West Hollywood. 
Already flavoring the City Council election in April is a plan by one candidate 
to have a referendum in November on whether to establish an independent city 
police force -- an idea narrowly beaten at the polls two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 A leader of the police campaign, Timothy P. Olson, is running for one of three 
available council seats, and his April showing could presage a November vote. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take long for the issue to have an impact. The City Council last 
week backed a proposal by incumbent John Heilman -- who is seeking reelection 
and has vigorously opposed a city police department -- to hire a consultant to 
compare the costs of such a force versus the city's current contract with the 
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The police initiative group likes the idea of an independent study, since so 
much of the 1992 debate came down to cost figures the two sides could not agree 
on. But the group's praise included a barb for Heilman. Olson accused him of 
stealing the study idea in order to "moderate" his previous opposition to a 
police force. 
</P>
<P>
 Heilman scoffed at that, saying he just wants the cost debate settled. And he 
groaned: "It's only January and it's starting already." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wild card?The odds are long and the windmill is spinning, perhaps even faster 
than usual. But Los Angeles businessman Nick Patsaouras believes dialogue 
strengthens and invigorates the body politic. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the 50-year-old Greek immigrant, who ran for the Los Angeles mayor's job 
in the spring (placing eighth) and won kudos for the intelligence of his 
platform, is now considering running for the Westside/Valley seat on the Los 
Angeles County Board of Supervisors being vacated by Ed Edelman. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Los Angeles Councilman Zev Yarolavsky is the candidate to beat. In 
fact, Yaroslavsky's daunting presence prompted state Sen. David Roberti (D-Van 
Nuys) to withdraw from the Edelman race before even firing a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's appealing -- there's no question about it," Patsaouras said last week of 
the Edelman opening. "I know the issues (of) the county but no one should kid 
themselves -- Zev is a tough campaigner."  
</P>
<P>
 Still, Patsaouras, who is Supervisor Mike Antonovich's appointee to the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said he will not let conventional 
political considerations totally guide his plans. "I don't want to get tangled 
up in too many technicalities," Patsaouras said. "The big question is -- do you 
feel good about doing this?" 
</P>
<P>
 Patsaouras said he also believes in the debate of ideas. "God help us," he 
said, "if only one person runs and they are anointed and crowned without a 
debate." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Hope springs eternal: Republicans regard the 24th Congressional District, an 
affluent stretch of suburban territory that includes Malibu, the southern San 
Fernando Valley and Thousand Oaks, as turf that ought to be theirs. Former 
Assemblyman Tom McClintock certainly thought so in 1992, when he bested eight 
other GOP candidates for the nomination.  
</P>
<P>
 McClintock, however, got walloped that November by veteran Democratic Rep. 
Anthony C. Beilenson, who had been forced by redistricting out of his old 
Westside stronghold. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Beilenson's 56% to 39% victory margin, another spirited Republican 
challenge appears to be taking shape this year. Bill Spillane of Westlake 
Village, the ex-fighter pilot who ran third in the 1992 GOP primary, has ended 
his musings and decided to endorse Newbury Park banking consultant Robert 
Hammer for the seat in this year's primary.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think he'll be a strong addition to our team," Hammer said last week. 
Meanwhile, Hammer has embarked on a low-key (so far) effort to learn about some 
of the area's social problems. One week he was joining West Valley LAPD vice 
squad officers in a raid on a house of prostitution, and the next he was 
helping out at a homeless shelter in Thousand Oaks.  
</P>
<P>
 "These are not big-deal things," Hammer said. "But instead of reading about 
these issues in a white paper, I'm seeing them firsthand. This campaign is 
about ears and voices -- hearing what the voters are having to say and then 
giving voice to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Does it sound as if Hammer is planning to contrast his own style with that of 
attorney Richard Sybert, who headed Gov. Pete Wilson's research and planning 
office? You bet. One can expect Hammer to portray Sybert -- who insiders say is 
the favorite to win the Republican primary -- as a soulless technocrat in an 
ivory tower.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to run a citizen's campaign, not a politician's campaign," 
Hammer said. 
</P>

 Decorum out the window: A bitter, private dispute over the management of 
finances and the quality of youth programs at the Beverly Hills Family YMCA 
erupted in the open at last week's Beverly Hills City Council meeting. One 
longtime city hall observer said it was one of the nastier outbursts he could 
recall.  
</P>
<P>
 Two parents, Michael Bilinsky and Al Ross, both of whom used to be volunteer 
basketball coaches at the Y, called executive director John Eikrem a liar and a 
clown. Eikrem, reading from a prepared statement, said the former coaches were 
"compulsive troublemakers" and that it was "no small coincidence that this type 
of silliness surfaces every four years when our board chair is running for 
reelection" to the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The YMCA chairman in question is City Councilman Robert K. Tanenbaum, whose 
council seat is one of two on the April ballot. Tanenbaum held his tongue 
during the verbal shelling, perhaps saving his ammunition for another day.  
</P>
<P>
 A review of the YMCA's financial records by the accounting firm of Ernst & 
Young turned up no irregularities, but the former coaches and several former 
employees insist that a more extensive audit of donations and expenses is 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The council resisted efforts by the former coaches to drag the city into the 
murky dispute. Councilman Allan Alexander said the council can properly 
consider during its annual budget deliberations in June whether the city should 
again contribute $37,500 to the Y as part of its annual donation to community 
service groups. But the internal operations of the Y should be addressed by the 
group's board of directors, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Case closed? Hardly. Bilinsky and Ross say they want Tanenbaum and the YMCA's 
executive director booted out of the organization, and will keep going to 
council meetings until they get what they want. 
</P>

WORLD AT YOUR FINGERTIPS; TRAVEL: MAPS, ACCESSORIES AND THOUSANDS OF TITLES 
MAKE THE TRAVELER'S BOOKCASE A DE RIGEUR STOPPING POINT FOR LOS ANGELES' 
INVETERATE GLOBETROTTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT SHIBUYA BROWN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After 22 years of roaming the world, Santa Monica investor Maurice Bretzfield 
can claim a fair share of experiences, from watching sunsets at an ancient 
castle in Jaipur, India, to camping high in the Himalayas with a group of 
Sherpas to crossing by foot into China under the stony gaze of armed border 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for Bretzfield and others like him, each new journey is prefaced by a trip 
to the Traveler's Bookcase, a bookstore on 3rd Street in the Beverly-Fairfax 
district that specializes in all things having to do with not staying at home. 
</P>
<P>
 With maps, travel accessories and more than 10,000 books ranging from country 
guides to travel literature to quality fiction, the 2-year-old Traveler's 
Bookcase is both an homage to wanderlust and a de rigeur stopping point for Los 
Angeles' inveterate travelers.  
</P>
<P>
 "You can travel the world without leaving the store," said Bretzfield, 46, who 
typically spends about six months a year on the road. "The place is almost an 
adventure unto itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Begun by lifelong friends Harriet Bay and Priscilla Ulene, Traveler's Bookcase 
is an example of a private passion gone public. Bay and Ulene are extensive 
travelers who both left successful careers -- Bay as an educational consultant 
and Ulene as a television and video producer -- to start the business.  
</P>
<P>
 Though there are about 75 travel bookstores nationwide, Westside travelers 
previously had to trek to specialty shops in Pasadena or Toluca Lake if they 
wanted to venture beyond the standard Fodor's and Frommer's fare found in 
general bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to introduce people to things they didn't know existed," said 
Ulene, who has trekked across New Zealand and spent vacations in New Guinea 
with her husband, Art, a health-care commentator for ABC. "We wanted to be a 
community resource."  
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, Traveler's Bookcase provides an array of services for its 
customers. In addition to the usual travel accessories such as alarm clocks, 
lightweight luggage and electric converters, customers can leaf through bound 
back-issues of travel magazines as well as have their passport photos snapped. 
For those too busy to stop in and wade through the selection, Bay and Ulene 
will fax bibliographies of suggested readings pertaining to a specific country 
or region. Soon, a computer will also be available so customers can input their 
travel tips as well as read about the experiences of others.  
</P>
<P>
 The arrival of Traveler's Bookcase has coincided with a blossoming during the 
last decade in travel literature. Though the number of travel titles published 
yearly has remained fairly constant -- there were 468 travel-related books 
published in 1992, according to Publishers Weekly -- the quality and variety of 
the literature has never been greater. Today, guides cater to adventure 
travelers, single travelers, those taking trips with children, women traveling 
alone, and gay and lesbian voyagers. Increasingly, guides come abundantly 
illustrated with rich color photos and text that emphasizes cultural 
information, in addition to the best place to get a meal. 
</P>
<P>
 At Traveler's Bookcase, Bay and Ulene have added another dimension to the 
selection, including in their stock quality fiction penned by writers from 
around the world. Such books are grouped with the travel literature so browsers 
interested in Trinidad, for example, might not only pick up the latest Insight 
guide but works by V.S. Naipaul as well.  
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it was so much a part of travel," said Bay, whose recent travels 
include Morocco and Cuba. "It's not just people and places. It's how they're 
touched by the country they're in." 
</P>
<P>
 Traveler's Bookcase also sponsors readings by travel writers. Mary Morris, a 
Brooklyn-based novelist ("A Mother's Love") who has also written travel 
memoirs, recalls her October reading at Traveler's Bookcase as being one of the 
most "delightful, intelligent and electric" presentations she has given, due to 
the turnout and ambience. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was something about having travel literature, suitcases and travel 
accouterments there that made it more alive," said Morris, who discussed her 
anthology, "Maiden Voyages: Writings of Women Travelers." "It's very rare that 
I meet a real traveler who's also not a real reader." 
</P>
<P>
 Bay and Ulene attribute the passion of travelers for the open road as one of 
the reasons their bookstore has prospered during a recession and at a time when 
independent bookstores are struggling to survive. According to Bay, hard times 
don't present obstacles to diehard travelers. She recalled one woman who wanted 
to see a map that showed the portion of the world between Europe and Southeast 
Asia because she was planning to drive from England to Vietnam. The same woman, 
said Bay, is now preparing for a five-month drive across Africa.  
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't just rich people who travel," said Bay. "If you love to travel, you 
just do it. You don't stay home." 
</P>
<P>
 Traveler's Bookcase is at 8375 W. 3rd St., Los Angeles ; (213) 655-0575. The 
store will host a publication party at 7 p.m. Tuesday for ESCAPE, a new 
adventure travel magazine.

OFFBEAT MUSICAL GETS SERIOUSLY SILLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The creators of "Crazy Words, Crazy Tunes" describe their show as "the musical 
that answers the question, 'Does the Chewing Gum Lose Its Flavor on the Bedpost 
Overnight?' " 
</P>
<P>
 As producer Edmund Gaynes explained, the show, which opens Tuesday for a 
two-week run at the Westwood Playhouse, showcases many of the wackiest songs of 
the 1920s, '30s and '40s. We're not talking Noel Coward here, said Gaynes, 
although some of the songs are sophisticated in their own fashion. What we're 
talking about are such zany evergreens as "Mairzy Doats" and such 
all-but-forgotten silly songs as "If I Give Up My Saxophone, Will You Come Back 
to Me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gaynes said "Crazy Words, Crazy Tunes," which premiered in August, 1992, at 
the Center Stage in Woodland Hills, is Los Angeles' longest running local 
musical. For some time, Gaynes was convinced it was the community's 
longest-running local play of any kind, but that honor, he learned, goes to 
"Zombie Attack," which rises from the dead once a week at the Cast Theater in 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Crazy Words" is a tribute to novelty songs, all those goofy ditties in which 
singing simians go on honeymoons and little lambs eat ivy. The show features 
different categories of nutty songs, including tunes about musical instruments 
(who can forget "To Hear Veronica Play Her Harmonica on the Pier in Santa 
Monica"?). Some of the compositions feature famous names, such as "When Henry 
Ford Apologized to Me." There are songs about places, including "Emma Louise 
from Old Los Angeles." And, of course, there are all those crazy food songs 
that children sing until their parents want to throttle them, from "One 
Meatball!" to a little-known gem with enormous juvenile appeal called "The 
Prune Song." 
</P>
<P>
 "What's that vegetable song?" Gaynes asked his wife, Pamela Hall, during a 
recent rehearsal. Hall, who not only directs the show but also performs in it, 
promptly sang a few bars of "When Banana Skins Are Falling, I'll Come Skidding 
Back to You." Vegetables, fruits -- with novelty songs who's making 
distinctions? 
</P>
<P>
 A shorter version of the show was created a decade ago by writer and Magic 
Castle owner Milton Larsen for his downtown Variety Arts Center. It was later 
expanded by arranger Gene Casey, Gaynes and Hall. The musical has been running 
at Gaynes and Hall's West End Theater in Van Nuys until it closed recently to 
prepare for its Westside premiere. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other directors of small local theaters, Gaynes is dismayed by how 
difficult it is to attract audiences. Most of the time, it is only the giant 
theaters that are able to fill their seats, he said, largely because they are 
the only ones who can afford to advertise. This despite the fact that small 
houses often offer innovative programming at modest prices. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, Gaynes recalled how the comedy-magic team of Penn & Teller 
received rave reviews a decade ago when the then little-known pair were playing 
at a tiny venue in Sherman Oaks. At the same time, illusionist David 
Copperfield was getting panned at the Pantages. Even after a local drama critic 
suggested that audiences forget Copperfield and check out this bizarre act out 
in the Valley, Gaynes said, "Copperfield continued to gross $250,000 a week and 
Penn & Teller continued to gross $800 a week." Go figure. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of the Valley theaters where "Crazy Words, Crazy Tunes" appeared were 
tiny, with fewer than 100 seats. The Westwood Playhouse seats 500. "We're 
enjoying being back in a big theater again," said Gaynes, who acted in a dozen 
Broadway and off-Broadway shows. Hall's Broadway credits include playing Philia 
in the Phil Silvers revival of "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the 
Forum." Her West Coast appearances include roles in "Sondheim -- A Musical 
Tribute" and Sondheim's "Marry Me a Little." 
</P>
<P>
 Nostalgia has been cited as the principal reason audiences like "Crazy Words, 
Crazy Tunes," but Gaynes and Hall think that's only a small part of its appeal. 
"Most of the people who come to see the show are too young to remember these 
songs," Gaynes pointed out. He thinks the real draw is that the production is 
very, very funny -- which may account for its popularity with children. "It's 
pure entertainment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although this show is no "Timon of Athens," it does have at least one thing in 
common with Shakespearean drama. The director's first and most pressing 
challenge is to make sure that the audience understands what the performers are 
saying or, in this case, singing. "Diction and intelligibility is a priority," 
he said. "If you don't understand the words, you don't get the jokes!" 
</P>
<P>
 The Westwood Playhouse is at 10886 Le Conte Ave . in Los Angeles, across from 
the UCLA campus. The shows continues through Jan. 23. All tickets are $20. For 
information, call (310) 208-5454.

PEOPLE: LITERACY GROUP HELPS AREA ONE READER AT A TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After the Los Angeles riots, Gwen Thomas and other members of West Angeles 
Church of God in Christ began looking for ways to improve their South-Central 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was the West Angeles Empowerment Team, a one-on-one tutoring 
service sponsored by the church and its pastor, Bishop Charles E. Blake. And 
the volunteer literacy program's coordinator is Gwen Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had no idea what we were going to do," said Thomas, a Los Angeles 
resident. "We decided to see if we could assist people with basic skills and 
play a role (in the community)." 
</P>
<P>
 The Empowerment Team has joined forces with the Los Angeles Public Library 
Adult Reading Project in its effort to combat illiteracy, which affects about 
1.5 million Los Angeles County residents. Volunteers were required to complete 
a 12-hour Laubauch tutor course, a nationally certified program administered by 
the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The Empowerment Team began with eight members trained to help South-Central 
Los Angeles residents in reading, writing and living skills. A year later, 
there are 83 certified tutors who work with first-time readers three hours a 
week over a period of six months at several libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been setbacks. Since the library system has suffered drastic budget 
cuts, Thomas says it is difficult to find libraries that remain open late in 
the evenings and on weekends, a significant problem because most program 
participants work during the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Thomas: "They have diminished the hours and can't hire new staff." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the cuts, Thomas hopes one day to establish a reading center at her 
church. 
</P>
<P>
 "I envision a center that would operate five days a week, have a full-scale 
reading center and have a state-of-the-art computer system," she said. "We want 
to be the ray of hope in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her volunteerism, Thomas is a business instructor at West Los 
Angeles College. She attended that school before continuing her studies at Cal 
State Dominguez Hills. A native of Memphis, Tenn., she was the first member of 
her family to graduate from college and knows firsthand the value of education. 
She feels that her church involvement and volunteer work have helped give 
meaning to her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to set an example," she said. "I believe education is the key to 
economic survival and economic success. That's why I believe so strongly in the 
literacy program." 
</P>

SENIORS; A PIONEER IN CANCER EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Helene G. Brown would probably be a prominent biologist today had she not 
decided that educating people about cancer would be a more effective use of her 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
 She has been known to fly her Cessna to college campuses to hold anti-smoking 
seminars. So ardent is her belief that certain cancers can be prevented through 
education that she took a salary cut at the Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center 
at UCLA so she could also lobby on health issues. She calls herself a political 
oncologist and cancer educator. And along the way, she has raised about $17 
million for the cause -- all from small donations. 
</P>
<P>
 It all started one day in 1950 when she went to see her doctor for a postnatal 
examination and he gave her a Pap smear. Brown was an educated 21-year-old -- 
she already had earned a degree in business administration at UCLA -- but she 
had never heard of a Pap smear.  
</P>
<P>
 "I asked my doctor, 'What is this?' After he told me about the test's ability 
to detect, early on, cervical cancer, I did some research and found out the 
test was perfected in 1938," she recalled in an interview at her office in 
Westwood.  
</P>
<P>
 In those days, an office visit and Pap smear cost just $5.50. Brown was 
appalled that so few women were aware of it.  
</P>
<P>
 "In the '50s women were not breadwinners, and doctors felt they didn't have to 
care for them as well," she said. "If doctors didn't tell women to get a Pap 
smear, then they would have to ask for it themselves, and the only way that was 
going to happen was if they were educated to do so."  
</P>
<P>
 And so began Brown's 43-year relationship with the American Cancer Society. 
Her first project, she said, was "a terrible but effective film" aimed at women 
that greatly increased awareness of the Pap test. After that, she moved on to 
two other cancers that education can do much to prevent: lung and breast 
cancer. She served as president and chairwoman of the board of the American 
Cancer Society in Los Angeles. Now she is active in a grass-roots movement 
called the Health Reform Task Force, whose mission is to educate the public 
about President Clinton's national health-care reform plan. 
</P>
<P>
 For Brown, education and prevention are the keys to good health. "I see a 
whole different paradigm for health care," she said. "Once we get into the 
preventive mode, which I think is the direction the President is going, 
combined with the gene research going on, we're going to see the ability to 
predict and manage disease rather than diagnose and treat, and I want to be 
part of the educational process." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Brown's current duties is advising the National Cancer Institute as a 
member of its Board of Scientific Counselors. Recently, she was part of a 
committee that provided the Clinton Administration with an update on the return 
on the $2-billion investment in cancer research over the last 10 years.  
</P>
<P>
 "My personal stake is working with the Administration on the grass-roots 
level, speaking at local meetings and dismissing the myths that have cropped up 
about health-care reform -- like choice of doctors," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Since older people have more time and experience in galvanizing neighbors for 
important causes, Brown thinks that they are the perfect messengers for the 
President's health care package.  
</P>
<P>
 "Seniors are change agents, and they need to be informed and inform others as 
well as question," she said. "There is so much confusion about health-care 
reform that those with the most experience and greatest needs can influence 
others."

OUR SECOND ANNUAL: TOURS FOR THE THINKING PERSON; A LOOK AT SOME OF 1994'S MOST 
INTRIGUING 'GOAL-ORIENTED' VACATIONS. THE BOTTOM LINE: THERE ARE MORE THAN EVER 
TO PICK FROM, AND COMPETITION IS BRINGING SOME PRICES DOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 What satisfies a thinking traveler most? An up-close look at artifacts worthy 
of the Smithsonian Institution? A panorama pulled from the pages of National 
Geographic magazine? 
</P>
<P>
 That first possibility is the enduring hope of Smithsonian officials, who in 
more than 20 years of sponsoring escorted tours have built up to a schedule 
that this year includes 300 departures to worldwide destinations. The 
Smithsonian Study Tours and Seminars program, based in Washington, D.C., 
anticipates some 7,000 passengers in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The second of those two travel scenarios, meanwhile, has set many gears 
grinding in the nearby offices of the National Geographic Society. In 
September, the society dispatched its first-ever escorted tour, an eight-day 
exploration of Colorado and New Mexico. For 1994, the On Tour with National 
Geographic program has scheduled 10 different itineraries, each likely to 
attract the same stripe of affluent and inquisitive traveler that the 
Smithsonian program aims for. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus begins perhaps the most genteel rivalry in the travel trade -- and thus 
do academically inclined American travelers have more vacation options to 
ponder than ever before. Want to take measure of rumblings within Costa Rica's 
Arenal Volcano? Stroll through the philatelic bureau on one of the Falklands? 
Ascend by helicopter to a remote lodge in the Canadian Rockies? Dig for 
dinosaur bones in Wyoming? All are possible, for a price. Costs usually range 
from $1,700 to $7,500 per person (excluding air fare) for journeys of eight to 
16 days, though some shorter and more affordable trips are offered. 
</P>
<P>
 The Smithsonian and National Geographic programs are hardly twins. Most 
obviously, Smithsonian's schedule of departure dates is more than 20 times as 
long as National Geographic's. Beyond that, Smithsonian's offerings include 
more tours that are tightly focused on a particular theme, often with special 
attention paid to museums, the arts or natural sciences. One three-day seminar 
this spring in Washington, D.C., will concentrate exclusively on picture frames 
in American art. The National Geographic programs, at least so far, suggest a 
broader approach; they're likely to mix culture with natural history, and often 
rely on scientists and writers associated with the magazine as lecturers. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, both programs fit into a burgeoning trend in the travel industry: the 
rise of the goal-oriented vacation -- in which travelers aim not only to escape 
their daily routines, but to widen their understanding of the world. Museums 
and university organizations have joined private-sector tour operators in 
jostling for the attention of such travelers, and many travel professionals 
expect the "thinking trip" market to get even more competitive in coming years. 
(For some top picks from this year's museum- and university-sponsored tours, 
see related stories on this page.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans are now well-traveled, and they're looking for more than the 
sights," says Bryan DeLeo, who directs National Geographic's On Tour program. 
"They're looking to learn and experience, to meet local people, and find out 
what's going on and what the history is." 
</P>
<P>
 One sign of heightened competition, and the struggling world economy, is in 
the pricing of 1994's tours. Of 98 itineraries listed in Smithsonian's 
catalogue of international tours, 37 are offered at lower prices than in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Another side effect of this rush to offer specialized travel, ironically, 
could be homogenization. As institutions scramble to strike up alliances with 
premier local outfitters and international tour operators, they often end up 
doing business with the same specialists. In 1994, National Geographic and 
Smithsonian are both acting as sponsors of voyages arranged by the tour 
operator Academic Travel Abroad, Inc., a Washington, D.C.-based firm that 
specializes in arranging travel programs for nonprofit groups. It's entirely 
possible that one of these days, groups of Smithsonian and National Geographic 
travelers may find themselves side by side in the same remote body of water, 
seated in canoes operated by the same local concessionaire and reserved by the 
same international tour operator. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a quick look at some of this year's offerings from each of these 
granddaddy nonprofit organizations. SMITHSONIAN STUDY TOURS/SEMINARS 
</P>
<P>
 The Smithsonian program, which took its current form in 1975, unabashedly aims 
for the most educated and often most wealthy travelers, noting in its catalogue 
the "rather exclusive company" a Smithsonian traveler keeps. The range of 
subjects and destinations among the Smithsonian's 300 or so departures is no 
less impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 Even confining yourself to this year's river trips, you find among the 
itineraries the Orinoco, the Nile, the Elbe, the Rhone, the Danube, the Green, 
the Mississippi, the Hudson, and the Salmon. Most tours, riverine and 
otherwise, run 7-15 days and cost $2,000-$5,000 (per person, double occupancy, 
air fare excluded). Smithsonian also offers seminars lasting 4-5 days and 
carrying prices of $900-$1,200 (per person, double occupancy, air fare 
excluded). 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the program's research expeditions, the seminars are the most 
thematically focused of Smithsonian tours. The research expeditions feature 
hands-on experience in rugged conditions, often contributing to research 
projects in the U.S. and abroad. Seminars are usually unaffiliated with 
research efforts, but packed with data. On March 14, for instance, a six-night 
wolf-tracking expedition begins in Banff and Jasper national parks, Canada, 
featuring briefing at the Calgary Zoo, hiking in search of prints and kill 
sites, lectures from a local wolf biologist, and a demonstration of radio 
telemetry in wolf tracking. (Price: $1,975 per person, double occupancy, air 
fare to Calgary excluded.) 
</P>
<P>
 For travelers seeking a broader focus, Smithsonian offers more than 100 
different "study tours" in the U.S. and abroad, each led by a guide with a 
specialty in the arts or natural sciences. Similar tours, but featuring larger 
groups and lower prices, are available through the Smithsonian Odyssey Tours 
classification. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most affordable trips offered this year: Springtime on the 
California Deserts, March 12-18, which includes a briefing by curators at the 
Palm Springs Desert Museum, guided wildflower and wildlife walks, hiking in 
Anza Borrego and Joshua Tree, and cottage lodgings for two nights at a Palm 
Springs guest ranch near the base of the Santa Rosa mountains. Price: $1,395 
per person, double occupancy, most meals included, air fare to Palm Springs 
excluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most exotic trips: Northwest Passage Aboard the Icebreaker Kapitan 
Khlebnikov, July 20-Aug. 5, which begins in Anchorage, proceeds via air and 
iceberg-strewn water through Russian-held islands, Inuit villages, the Bering 
Strait and various islands above the Arctic Circle, returning by air via the 
village of Resolute and the city of Toronto. The ship includes 56 cabins and 
two helicopters, the better to land on ice-clogged shores. Prices for standard 
cabins start at $13,070 per person, double occupancy, including most meals, air 
fare to Anchorage and from Toronto excluded. 
</P>

(202) 357-4700. ON TOUR WITH NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of the On Tour trip, says program director DeLeo, is to offer 
programs "that reflect the variety of topics that one finds in reading National 
Geographic magazine -- some geography, some art, some architecture, culture, 
natural history, wildlife and science . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 The lecturers who lead travelers through these programs usually have strong 
ties to the magazine. Bill Bryson, author of a 1992 National Geographic article 
about Europe's Main-Danube Canal, in June will lecture a tour group on the same 
waters. William Graves, editor of the magazine since 1990, will lecture on a 
13-day July expedition to the Aleutian Islands and the Russian Far East. 
</P>
<P>
 National Geographic tours are marketed most heavily to those who already hold 
society memberships, and carry prices comparable to Smithsonian's. (The society 
counts about 9 million members, each of whom receives National Geographic 
magazine and pays dues beginning at $21 yearly. To take a National Geographic 
tour, you must become a society member.) 
</P>
<P>
 The most affordable tour of the organization's Spring-Fall '94 catalogue: 
National Parks of Utah and Arizona, an eight-day program that includes Zion and 
Bryce Canyon national parks and the Grand Canyon. Lecturers are Otis Imboden, a 
National Geographic staff photographer from 1962 to '82 (who will accompany the 
group departing Las Vegas Sept. 15), and Scott Thybony, author of the National 
Geographic book "Canyon Country Parklands" (who will accompany the Oct. 6 
group). Groups sizes are limited to 35. Price: $1,680 per person, double 
occupancy, including some meals, excluding air fare. 
</P>
<P>
 The most exotic trip in the catalogue is probably a 15-day journey to Irian 
Jaya, the Spice Islands and Bali, with departures Sept. 16 and Sept 23. That 
itinerary includes nine nights aboard a 19-cabin cruise ship, an introduction 
to Asmat people, and village visits that feature terraced rice fields and the 
steaming volcano Gunung Api in the Banda Islands. Tobias Schneebaum, an 
anthropologist who has lived for several years among the Asmat, is a lecturer. 
Prices begin at $4,850 per person, double occupancy, including most meals, 
excluding air fare. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Geographic Spring-Fall catalogue includes six different tours 
(some are offered more than once, yielding a total of 12 planned group 
departures). If business goes well, DeLeo says, the 1994-95 Fall-Spring 
catalogue will probably include 10 different itineraries.

OUR SECOND ANNUAL: TOURS FOR THE THINKING PERSON; 5 TOP UNIVERSITY TOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 School on the road, you might call it -- travel programs offered as non-credit 
courses by colleges and universities around the world. Unlike the hostel-style, 
six- to 12-week study abroad programs designed for college students, these 
programs are specifically created to meet the time constraints, lodging 
requirements and interests of adult travelers -- travelers who, in the words of 
Professor Charles A. McKee, director of Michigan State University's Lifelong 
Education program, "want to bring home more than their luggage. They want to 
learn something." 
</P>
<P>
 Marian Goldberg, a New York-based veteran of several years in the field of 
academic travel, reviewed scores of 1994 itineraries for The Times' Travel 
section, and came up with the following five recommendations. 
</P>

first-class hotels, meals, transfers; excluding air fare to Italy. Another 
option: Yervant Terzian, chairperson of Cornell's astronomy department, will 
explore "Terrestrial and Cosmic Landscapes of Hawaii" on the Big Island and 
Maui, March 19-27. Cost: $2,290, including lodging, meals, land and 
inter-island transportation; excluding air fare to Hawaii.

 Celebrating the 25th year of its Oxford Berkeley program, the university is 
offering 24 adult courses in two sessions (July 4-23 and July 25-Aug. 1). 
Participants can learn about the "Making of the English Countryside" from 
Thomas Greeves, a cultural environmentalist and former archeologist at Dartmoor 
National Park. There are also six new study programs to the Continent and a 
cultural history tour of New Orleans, April 21-May 1. Cost for the New Orleans 
trip: $1,295, including course fee, single room residence hall accommodation, 
some meals, field trips; excluding air fare to Louisiana. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 UBC offers far-flung international programs and "field studies" courses in and 
near British Columbia. One field study offering: "Queen Charlotte Islands: A 
Place of Wonder," is led by art historian Robin Wright, curator of Native 
American Art at the Burke Museum in Seattle. June 16-23. Cost: $2,140,

</P>
<P>
 The risks of producing and publicizing a study program that may be canceled 
due to insufficient enrollment can often outweigh the benefits. Enter 
TraveLearn, an educational tour operator that organizes tours for a consortium 
of more than 230 colleges and community schools around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Affiliated schools include: California State University, Los Angeles (tel.

City College (tel. 818-585-7608). Participants usually register through the 
nearest school. Tours include a 14-day Ecuador program, which includes a visit 
with a native family in Quito and a seven-day Galapagos island cruise. Cost: 
$2,925, including deluxe hotels and three meals daily; excluding air fare to 
Ecuador.

TRAVEL INSIDER: SECOND-GUESSING THE RATES THAT TOUR COMPANIES OFFER; LODGING: 
IT PAYS TO CHECK IF YOUR OPERATOR IS REALLY GETTING YOU THE BEST HOTEL PRICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS, TIMES TRAVEL WRITER/ Reynolds travels anonymously at 
the newspaper's expense, accepting no special discounts or subsidized trips. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the whole, Dov B. Malkin of Los Angeles had a rewarding vacation in Peru in 
November. But he might have come home happier still had he not started asking 
questions at the hotels arranged by his tour operator. At one lodging in Lima, 
where Malkin and his fellow tour members were paying $78 nightly, Malkin found 
that similar rooms were available for $60 a night. At another hotel in the 
inland city of Cuzco, the travelers on Malkin's tour paid $47 nightly, while 
guests off the street were paying $24. 
</P>
<P>
 This understandably troubled Malkin, and he laid out his case to me in a 
letter. His perplexity offers an important reminder for those who travel with 
tour groups: Tour operators can often negotiate attractive discounts with 
hotels because of their strength in numbers, and often mention such discounts 
in marketing their trips. But since tour operators seldom volunteer specific 
breakdowns of their package prices, travelers should pay close attention to 
itinerary details and package prices, or risk paying unnecessarily steep rates 
to inefficient or unscrupulous tour operators. 
</P>
<P>
 James J. Murphy, chairman of the U.S. Tour Operators Assn., estimates that 
large-scale tour operators pay 40%-70% of a hotel's undiscounted "off-the-rack" 
rates, passing some of that savings along to customers. Individual travelers 
can't count on doing that well, but a smart lodger generally can find a price 
substantially below a hotel's "rack" rates, often by seeking out weekend 
specials at business hotels or off-season or mid-week rates at lodgings that 
rely on leisure travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy notes that the rates tour operators negotiate vary widely depending on 
the tour operator, the number of travelers he or she can deliver, the part of 
the world and the time of year. The tour operators who generally get the best 
rates, he says, are those who bring in a steady stream of groups -- an arrival 
every week for two months, for instance -- and who can predict the size of 
those groups with some specificity. Operators who tend to reserve more rooms 
than they later fill may get less advantageous rates from hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Launder, president of Garden Grove-based Contiki Holidays, notes that 
his negotiations with hotels often take place a full year in advance of the 
group's arrival, and in cities like Los Angeles and Las Vegas can involve as 
many as 5,000 to 6,000 rooms yearly. In such circumstances, Launder says, a 
tour operator can get "fantastic" rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Some tour operators have cut out middlemen entirely by purchasing and 
operating their own lodgings -- in Contiki's case, a chateau in the Beaujolais 
region of France and a villa in Florence, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, Launder acknowledges, in areas where demand for accommodations far 
surpasses supply, tour operators have less bargaining strength, and may offer a 
narrower margin of advantage over the walk-in rates available to individual 
travelers. The Grand Canyon is one such place. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, it doesn't take too much work for a traveler to satisfy himself, or 
herself, that a tour operator is charging sensible rates. Before you buy a tour 
package, ask a travel agent how it stacks up against comparable itineraries 
offered by other tour operators, or call other operators yourself. To get into 
greater detail -- though this could mean a lot of phone calls to hotels -- take 
the overall tour price (excluding air fare) and divide it by the number of the 
nights you'll spend in hotels. Then call the hotels to see what rate you would 
get as an independent traveler. 
</P>
<P>
 Before you jump to any conclusions about the numbers before you, consider 
several factors: On a tour, you're usually paying also for the expertise of 
guides, ground transportation, and often meals and other services. Also, 
remember that most hotels in the United States, and many elsewhere, quote rates 
before taxes, which often boost the bill by 10%-20%. Keep in mind, too, that 
unexpectedly weak business can lead a hotel manager to drop prices to levels he 
or she wouldn't have offered six months or a year earlier, when the tour 
contract was signed. 
</P>
<P>
 James Murphy's company, Van Nuys-based Brendan Tours, is offering a six-night 
London trip next year, with lodgings at the Stakis St. Ermin's Hotel between 
Victoria Station and Westminster Abbey. Using Brendan's package tour, a couple 
would pay about $95 per person, per night (excluding air fare), and in the 
bargain receive free transportation to and from the airport, continental 
breakfasts, a two-day public transportation pass, a welcome drink, a half-day 
sightseeing tour, and a pair of theater tickets valued at $50 each. The hotel's 
published "rack" rates, meanwhile, work out to roughly $115 per person per 
night, double occupancy. A better price (about $88 per person, per night) is 
available if that couple reserves a St. Ermin's room via a toll-free call to 
Utell, the hotel's U.S. booking agents -- but that rate includes no extras. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent travelers often can get further discounts by calling overseas 
hotels directly. But tour operators may be able to arrange air fares at better 
prices, and tour groups offer freedom from logistical wrangling and the clout 
of an international organization that can swing into action in a medical crisis 
or emergency.

A FOLKSY HAIL TO THE CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Did you ever wonder what Franklin Delano Roosevelt would look like as the 
Great Sphinx? How about a rendering of Ronald Reagan in jelly beans? These and 
54 other concoctions make up "To the President: Folk Portraits by the People," 
on exhibit through Sept. 5 at the Smithsonian's National Portrait Gallery in 
Washington, D.C. Borrowed mainly from the official libraries of our last 11 
Presidents, the 56 portraits range from solemn to slapstick.Curator James 
Barber calls the portraits "attic art, cellar craft and avant-garage 
sculpture," and regards them as tangible evidence of the American genius. 
"They're often funny but seldom silly," he says. They may be viewed during 
gallery hours, 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. daily.

JUST THE FACTS; TRYING NEW WAYS TO BOOK TRIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although most travelers use travel agents or call direct to hotels ad airlines 
when they plan vacations, a number are willing to try something new.That's 
according to a telephone survey by the U.S. Travel Data Center. For example, 
only 3% of 1,500 respondents said they had used on-line computer services to 
make trip arrangements, but 12% may try them in the future. Two percent said 
they had used travel services offered by retail stores, but 10% thought that 
might be the way to go someday. And although only 1% had dabbled with simulated 
travel experiences, referred to as "virtual reality", 11% might in the future. 
Other survey results are in the chart.

WEEKEND ESCAPE: SAN FRANCISCO; A NEIGHBORHOOD LOVE SONG; A FORMER RESIDENT 
RETURNS TO THE SIGHTS AND SMELLS OF SAN FRANCISCO'S ITALIAN-FLAVORED NORTH 
BEACH, AND IS ELATED TO REDISCOVER ITS BUSTLING CAFE SCENE

 "Why should I tell 'em?" I would always think when some Southern California 
prig dismissed North Beach as nothing more than a collection of strip shows, 
dirty book stores and sleazy front-door barkers. I would nod sympathetically, 
even cluck solicitously, but my mind's nose would be elsewhere, inhaling the 
most sensual collection of aromas to be had in all of San Francisco. I wanted 
to hoard it all, figuratively, and I didn't want everyone to know that I was 
living on the hill just above the most blazingly olfactory neighborhood in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 I had an apartment 10 years ago on Telegraph Hill, up near Coit Tower, but 
North Beach -- the trough between Telegraph and Russian hills and between 
Chinatown and Fisherman's Wharf -- was my real home. It is 99.44% Italian, and 
spectacular food and drink and open-armed talk are the stuff of life there. You 
exist from restaurant to cafe to bar, hardly ever calling on friends at home 
but circulating endlessly "down in the neighborhood," and if you don't find who 
you're looking for in one place, you move on -- and on -- until you do, or 
until you fall in with a crowd you like just as well, or until you're so wired 
on espresso that you find yourself speed walking all the way to Marin County.

 It was a playpen for big people, and after a decade away, I missed it. 
</P>
<P>
 But how to go back without feeling like a spy? One of the Union Square hotels 
would be within easy walking distance, but I wanted to crawl back into the 
neighborhood as if it were an old afghan. What I wanted was a short stay at 
someplace small, cozy, within smelling distance of Cuneo's French and Italian 
Bakery. San Francisco-based Bed and Breakfast International, a booking agency, 
came through with the Washington Square Inn, at the corner of Stockton and 
Filbert streets, overlooking the very heart of North Beach. The location was 
better than perfect, and the rates (from $85 for a room with shared bath to 
$180 for a room with bath and a view of the square) were within range. 
</P>
<P>
 I pulled up in a cab on a sunny Friday afternoon around 12:30, inhaled the 
North Beach lunchtime air once, and resolved to eat immediately, thoroughly 
delighted that I could dawdle over my meal without having to hustle back to 
work downtown. The veal Marsala at North Beach Restaurant more than made up for 
the lack of inspiration in the restaurant's name, and set me up perfectly for 
the weekend. Now it was time to get reacquainted with the bohemian core. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two main arteries through North Beach -- Columbus Avenue and Grant 
Street -- and I decided to stroll Grant, easily the funkier of the two. Grant 
is the main street running through Chinatown, but when it begins again on the 
north side of Broadway, it becomes a patchwork of tiny shops, cafes and 
overhanging turrets. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom of the street, just above Broadway, is the best indication of what 
you're about to get as you walk up the hill. The infamous Condor Club, where an 
image of pneumatic stripper Carol Doda once flashed off and on in the night sky 
above the other aging strip joints on Broadway, is now the Condor Bistro, a 
completely benign eatery-and-bar combo. A couple of doors away is the far 
earthier Saloon, a haunt of gonzo journalist Hunter Thompson and locus of 
down-and-dirty live rhythm-and-blues in the evenings. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the venerable Caffe Trieste that drew me, however. Chocolate brown, 
well-used, beckoning, it hadn't changed one jot in the last decade. Terribly 
earnest couples in their 20s, in dark clothes and berets, huddle here to rattle 
newspapers and smoke, and the cappuccino is still the best in the neighborhood. 
I ordered a big one and settled into a corner and felt the muscles beginning to 
sag. You linger here. You can't help it. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, though, I had to get to the twin destinations, only a block or so 
away, of the City Lights Bookstore and the Vesuvio Cafe, the epicenter of the 
beat movement. Funkier still than Caffe Trieste, Vesuvio is a gargoyle of a 
building whose second story has a fine view of the busy Broadway/Columbus 
intersection. The clientele and particularly the bartenders are friendly and 
chatty, and we had several good laughs over a pint of Anchor Steam beer, the 
best draft in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so next door at City Lights. I once was bounced from this dingy 
all-paperback bookstore when I had the effrontery to come in and browse -- 
dressed in a suit -- while William Burroughs was autographing books. The 
radical politics of the shop were still firmly in place and the clerks -- young 
women with pierced jewelry protruding from unusual places and the standard 
angry young men -- frowned obligingly. I allowed myself an indulgence and a nod 
to bohemian life, bought a copy of "Tropic of Cancer" and felt better about it. 
</P>
<P>
 It was time to make the climb back uphill, up Columbus Street to Washington 
Square, and maybe a gelato at Mara's cafe and a peek into Molinari's 
delicatessen, the Italian deli that can send your taste buds into overdrive, 
even if you've just eaten. But, along the way, it dawned: Where did all these 
little cafes come from? 
</P>
<P>
 Columbus has always had its share of restaurants and shops but now, it seemed, 
there was a new cafe every 10 feet or so. Caffe Greco and Caffe Puccini, for 
instance, were separated by only three or four steps. Cappuccino machines were 
hissing. Everywhere people were hunched over tiny tables, sipping, reading, 
gnawing on pastry. It appeared to be possible to spend an entire day 
ricocheting from one cafe to another, loading up on caffeine, augmenting the 
effects with rich Italian sweets. I passed. There was, I knew, tea waiting at 
the Washington Square Inn. 
</P>
<P>
 Afternoon tea is one of the true attractions of this little B&B. Cucumber 
sandwiches, varieties of cookies, several different kinds of tea, cheeses and 
crackers and wine, all served in front of a warm fire in the fireplace -- it 
was enough to deaden my wanderlust for a while. The entire place is furnished 
in English and French antiques, and the view of the square, one of the jewels 
of San Francisco, is a plus. 
</P>
<P>
 (My room had no view, but I poked around in one of the upper front rooms 
during my stay and vowed to pay the extra bucks to get one next time. The 
turret windows are fitted with window seats and they command a view of the 
square that takes in everything from the majestic Sts. Peter and Paul Church to 
the north to the venerable Fior d'Italia on the south -- the oldest Italian 
restaurant in San Francisco.)  
</P>
<P>
 The next two gloriously cloudy and rainy days were a combination of initiative 
and indolence. I crisscrossed the neighborhood on foot several times a day, 
never lacking for genial company behind any door. At La Rocca's Corner, a 
time-tested bar on the Powell and Mason Streets cable car line, I ran into Dick 
Murray, a scout for the Dodgers, and marveled at his pair of huge World Series 
rings. At the Washington Square Bar and Grill, I was offered a Havana corona by 
a jolly man from Utah, and smoked it, unmolested, while the piano player sailed 
through several Vince Guaraldi numbers.  
</P>
<P>
 I dropped into Lyle Tuttle's tattoo parlor and museum on Columbus Street and 
kibitzed as a young woman submitted to the needle and walked out with a pair of 
cherries on one thigh. (Sign on the wall, to ward off the inevitable question: 
"Yes, it hurts!") On a quick detour outside -- just outside -- of North Beach, 
I visited Brandy Ho's Hunan restaurant in northern Chinatown and watched at the 
counter the fastest wok cookery in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 And I returned to what is, to me, the most appealing single street in North 
Beach: Green Street, between Grant and Columbus. In this single little strip, 
about as long as a healthy 6-iron shot, is the little restaurant many consider 
the best in the neighborhood (Caffe Sport, which perfumes the entire street 
with cooking garlic), one of the last family-style Italian restaurants in the 
city (Dante Benedetti's New Pisa, where the bar is like a baseball museum -- 
Dante played with Joe DiMaggio on the Yankees and coached at the University of 
San Francisco), two of the more creative bakeries in the area, and what many 
consider the social center of North Beach, the Gino & Carlo bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Saving my take-home purchases until last, I walked away with a fistful of 
unique postcards from a shop on Grant, a silk tie printed with Dr. Seuss' 
"Green Eggs and Ham" characters from a shop in northern Chinatown, a loaf of 
Acme sourdough bread from Molinari's and a sack of hand-rolled bread sticks 
from Cuneo's. 
</P>
<P>
 When I got home, I found that I'd walked blisters on both feet. For the 
renewal of an old friendship, the price was worth it.

THE HEALTHY TRAVELER: SEPARATE VACATIONS FOR COUPLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Linda Graham loves making quilts and learning new tips from others interested 
in the craft. Her husband, Scott Graham, has a passion for ski slopes and 
classic cars. Last April they went their separate ways -- she to Paducah, Ky., 
for a 10-day quilt-making convention and he to a car rally in Cambria. 
</P>
<P>
 No, their 18-year marriage is not on the skids. Vacationing alone satisfies 
their personal needs, the Grahams have discovered, without threatening the 
state of their union. In fact, they say, it improves married life. "If I 
schlepped him to a quilt show, he would be moaning and groaning," she said. 
Likewise, she'd prefer sitting out a trip to even the most posh ski resort. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to their separate treks, the Grahams also take vacations together 
-- mostly within California, stealing away for long weekends to San Francisco, 
San Diego and Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 While separate vacations aren't for everyone, the number of couples who 
routinely vacation separately is small but growing, experts estimate. Yet even 
in the '90s, there is a social stigma. "People hear about separate vacations 
and think, 'Oh, the marriage must be on the rocks,' " said Constance Ahrons, a 
Santa Monica family therapist and USC professor of sociology. 
</P>
<P>
 To decide if separate is the way to go, couples should consider the pluses and 
minuses, therapists say. "What is important is the way the decision is reached 
by the couple and how comfortable they are," said Mathilda B. Canter, a Phoenix 
clinical psychologist. 
</P>
<P>
 One obvious plus, Ahrons said, is that partners can pursue their different 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 But separate vacations can also help people define themselves as other than 
someone's wife or husband. "Marriage doesn't mean you spend 100% of your time 
together," said Peter A. Wish, a clinical psychologist in Framingham, Mass. 
"Everybody harbors a desire (at some time or another) to go away by 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 One East Coast woman with three children startled her husband by announcing 
plans to go on a hiking adventure trip, Wish recalled. The husband initially 
balked, but warmed to the idea after he felt comfortable that he could take 
adequate care of the kids and the house until she returned. 
</P>
<P>
 While such unilateral vacations work for some, therapists suggest couples 
might want to consider traveling simultaneously -- if separately -- to minimize 
resentment that one partner is playing while the other is working. 
</P>
<P>
 Vacationing alone can also provide partners with a crucial respite from the 
fine art of compromise. "A committed relationship involves a lot of 
compromise," said Ahrons. Often, vacation destinations are a trade-off: he goes 
to Hawaii this year, if she goes fishing the next. "Continual compromise 
doesn't work for very long," Ahrons said. "If someone keeps denying their 
needs, resentment can build." 
</P>
<P>
 "In a relationship, you can't be self-centered," Canter said. "But on a 
separate vacation, you can think about only yourself. You can't do that on a 
joint trip." 
</P>
<P>
 When she counsels divorcing couples, Ahrons often hears: "Finally, I get to 
take the vacation I want!" Yet some couples realize potential problems 
connected with continual compromise before it's too late. Ahrons recalls a 
couple who spent a week touring London museums and seeing theater, spurred by 
the wife's love of the arts. The husband had wanted a sports vacation, but 
accompanied his wife and ended up miserable. For the next vacation, the woman 
took an arts-oriented trip in the company of a woman friend while her husband 
went golfing. Both came back rested and happier. 
</P>
<P>
 When each partner goes a different way, "each brings back new stories and new 
experiences to share," Canter said. "You also have a chance to miss the 
person," she added, and that can certainly put differences in perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 One couple Canter knew combined the best of both worlds. Each picked a site to 
visit on their own and then met in an exotic place -- Paris was a favorite -- 
and traveled home together. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, go-it-alone trips can pose drawbacks. "They can raise more problems 
than they solve," Canter admitted, especially if there is a lack of trust. 
Couples who strike out on their own are also missing out on the "couple time" 
that is valuable to building and maintaining intimacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Two separate trips can also put stress on the budget. "Money always enters 
into the decision," Ahrons said, especially if one partner takes an extravagant 
vacation and leaves insufficient funds for the other. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also the potential for worry -- not just about infidelity but about 
accidents and health problems. To dispel such fears, couples should set up 
ground rules. "Talk about how often or if you will contact each other," Canter 
suggested. Not everyone feels the need. "We don't have ground rules," said 
Linda Graham. "We don't ask permission. But we do check in, asking each other, 
'Have I been gone too much?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Certain separate vacations are more socially acceptable than others, 
therapists say. A woman going to a spa, a man going fishing, either visiting 
family members -- none of these provokes much reaction. But if a partner goes 
off alone on a non-guided tour or on a bike trip with men and women, that's 
more daring -- and often perceived as more threatening by the partner. "If a 
man goes away by himself, the natural tendency is to think the goal is to fool 
around," Wish said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who tend to go away (separately) either have a pretty secure marriage 
or not a very good marriage at all," Wish said. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it works, it works well. "Scott likes it that I have other 
interests," said Linda Graham, the West Los Angeles quilt maker. "When we spend 
time together, we are much happier because we have already done our own thing."

BOOKS TO GO: A SLEW OF WORTHY TITLES TO BEGIN THE NEW YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By COLMAN ANDREWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I see literally hundreds and hundreds of new travel books each year, many of 
them quite good and some of them positively brilliant. Of necessity, though, I 
let hundreds and hundreds of these volumes -- even some of the worthy ones -- 
go unreviewed. They just won't fit. Even the ones that make the first cut 
sometimes wait months for a berth in these pages, and sometimes never seem "to 
go" at all. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time to move some of them along. To get the year off to a fresh start -- 
and to empty my review shelf at least part way -- here are briefer-than-usual 
notes on, well, as many of these books as will fit in this space (with more 
briefs to come in my next column). 
</P>
<P>
 LOOKING FOR OSMAN by Eric Lawlor (Vintage Departures, $11 paper). Subtitled 
"One Man's Travels Through the Paradox of Modern Turkey," this is an 
entertaining, almost novelistic excursion into a remarkable and, er, 
paradoxical nation -- a country that appears (at least when viewed through 
Lawlor's not unjaundiced eye) to be partially emergent and partially 
antithetical to going anywhere at all. 
</P>
<P>
 MAVERICK GUIDE TO PRAGUE by Leonard Levine (Pelican, $14.95 paper). With 
Prague threatening to become the next new European cultural hot spot, this is a 
particularly timely guidebook. It's also a nicely fashioned one, with loads of 
useful cultural tips and plenty of evocative description woven into the 
nuts-and-bolts practical material on the city. Also included is a section on (I 
love this phrase) "daytrips to Bohemia." 
</P>
<P>
 ADVENTURING IN NEW ZEALAND: The Sierra Club Travel Guide to the Pearl of the 
Pacific by Margaret Jefferies (Sierra Club Books, $15 paper). Ah, New Zealand, 
land of contrasts! Ski slopes, tropical beaches, rain forests, modern cities, 
national parks and more -- they're all in New Zealand, and all in this 
well-researched, if not particularly stylishly written guidebook. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SANTA FE TRAIL BY BICYCLE: A Historic Adventure by Elaine Pinkerton (Red 
Crane Books, $12.95 paper). A lively account of a 1,100-mile, 21-day journey 
along the legendary Santa Fe Trail, from Santa Fe, N.M., through Colorado and 
Kansas and all the way to New Franklin, Mo. The jaunt is great fun to read 
about, and daunting to consider. 
</P>
<P>
 BELIZE HANDBOOK by Chicki Mallan (Moon Publications, $13.95 paper) and BELIZE: 
A Natural Destination, second edition, by Richard Mahler and Steele Wotkyns 
(John Muir Publications, $16.95 paper). With all the ink Belize has inspired in 
the last couple of years, I'm not sure that it's correct to call it a "travel 
secret" anymore -- but it remains less well-known than it should be (be honest, 
now: can you place it exactly on a map?), considering its many attractions -- 
from Mayan ruins to animated night life to an astonishing wealth of flora and 
fauna. Mallan's book on the place is rich with detail, if abbreviated in style. 
Mahler and Wotkyns are more thoughtful and leisurely with their prose (and also 
rather drier), and are particularly strong, as their sub-title suggests, on the 
country's natural history. 
</P>
<P>
 GERRY FRANK'S WHERE TO FIND IT, BUY IT, EAT IT IN NEW YORK, 1994-1995 edition, 
by Gerry Frank (Gerry's Frankly Speaking, $12.95 paper) and NEW YORK CITY 
STARWALKS by Larry Wolfe Horwitz (St. Martin's Press, $12.95 paper). Frank's 
title says it all: His 652-page tome is less a guidebook than a reference 
manual, jam-packed with lists, mini-reviews and miscellaneous do's and don'ts 
-- a consumer's compendium of Gotham goodies. Horwitz, with tongue (one hopes) 
in cheek, walks Manhattan dropping names. If you care where assorted 
celebrities reside (everyone from Tom Cruise to Blair Brown to Peggy Cass), 
what Steve Martin's like before he has his morning coffee (grumpy) or -- God 
help you -- why Sally Jessy Raphael loves New York -- this one's for you. 
</P>
<P>
 BUSHWALKING IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA by Yvon Pe russe (Lonely Planet, $14.95 
paper); CHILE & EASTER ISLAND by Wayne Bernhardson (Lonely Planet, $15.95 
paper), and MALDIVES & ISLANDS OF THE EAST INDIAN OCEAN by Mark Balla and Bob 
Willox (Lonely Planet, $12.95 paper). More excellent guides from 
Australia-based Lonely Planet, all written with the usual (for this publisher) 
authority, attention to detail and at least glimmers of style and wit. 
</P>
<P>
 FODOR'S LONDON COMPANION: The Guide for the Independent Traveler by Louise 
Nicholson (Fodor's, $17 paper). The London Tourist Board and Convention Bureau 
named an earlier edition of this wordy but very readable guidebook as "Best 
London Guide." No wonder: London-based Nicholson knows her city intimately and 
writes like a generous insider, both sharing her best secrets and suggesting 
fresh ways of looking at familiar sights in this revised and updated volume. 
</P>
<P>
 EXPLORING THE BLACK HILLS & BADLANDS: A Guide for Hikers, Cross-country 
Skiers, and Mountain Bikers by Hiram Rogers (Cordillera Press, $14.95 paper). 
Just the facts, geographical and historical, about a beautiful, dramatic and 
often just plain rugged region spilling across Wyoming and North and South 
Dakota. The maps are even more serious than the text.

TASTE OF TRAVEL: BRAZIL: RIO, RICE AND BEANS; ELABORATE FEIJOADA BUFFETS IN 
LUXURY HOTELS AND RESTAURANTS TEMPT TOURISTS, AND LOCALS, TO DINE ON BRAZILIAN 
HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEIDI HAUGHY CUSICK, Cusick is a free-lance food writer who lives in 
Mendocino. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Feijoada , the multi-dish meal that's become chic here, reflects the ironies 
of this geographically beautiful city, where beggars hover near million-dollar, 
beach-front structures. Originally created as a rice-and-bean pot to feed West 
African slaves working on Brazil's sugar plantations during the 18th and 19th 
centuries, feijoada has evolved into a multi-course event of hedonistic 
proportions at Rio's lavish hotels and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Merging the ingredients and cooking methods of three continents, the feijoada 
meal is based on beans and rice, both found in West Africa, usually flavored 
with pork introduced to Brazil by the Portuguese and thickened with ground 
cassava indigenous to South America. 
</P>
<P>
 While researching a book on African influences on cooking in the Americas last 
year, I was curious to see how far this meal with the musical-sounding name 
(pronounced fej-WAH-dah) had been taken. From its origins as a means for 
stretching leftover pork odds and ends by adding them to belly-filling beans, 
feijoada has been expanded for hotel and restaurant buffets where black beans 
are served with a wide variety of meats and other foods. 
</P>
<P>
 Where else can you taste pig ears, feet and tails next to pork loin, beef 
steak and sausages, amid an abundant offering of mangoes, papayas, pineapples, 
watermelon and exotic tropical fruits? 
</P>
<P>
 One-dish and modified versions are offered on various days throughout Rio, as 
well as at Sunday lunches in private homes, but on Saturday afternoons, 
well-to-do Brazilians line up with tourists for feijoada buffet extravaganzas 
served in the world-class hotels along Rio's famous beaches. The buffets 
imitate and elaborate on the meals traditionally served at home on Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 At home, families gather around dining tables set with steaming bowls of black 
beans flavored with pork, garlic and onion, and seasoned with chilies, ground 
pepper, bay leaves, parsley, oregano and sometimes cumin and dried basil. Also 
on the table might be bowls of white rice and of sauteed greens ( couve ) and, 
maybe, platters of grilled pork chops or sliced pork loin. Diners dish up the 
hearty beans, rice, greens and pork and spike it to taste with a spoonful of 
hot chili salsa (molho de pimenta). They probably also sprinkle on the toasted 
cassava meal (farofa) to thicken the beans. 
</P>
<P>
 In hotels and restaurants, feijoada -- the name comes from feija o, the 
Portuguese word for beans -- is often served with batidas, drinks made of fresh 
mango, passion fruit, coconut, papaya or lime juice doused with cachaca, a 
sugar cane liquor something like rum. I found the drink called caipirinha -- 
limes crushed with sugar and cachaca -- to be crisp, tart and a perfect 
accompaniment to the feijoada.  
</P>
<P>
 Feijoada completa (the full buffet, as served in hotels) typically begins with 
a sort of non-alcoholic aperitif: a tiny sampling of black bean soup made from 
beans simmered for hours with salted and smoked meats. Then you go to the 
buffet, which includes another pot of black beans, plus grilled pork chops, 
sauteed beef liver, stewed pig's feet, smoked sausages, sauteed plantains, 
sauteed greens, pots of farofa, sliced pork loin, hot sauce and platters of 
tropical fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 The meal stretches out on buffet tables in cast-iron caldrons and terra-cotta 
casseroles -- holdovers from the dish's origin when it was cooked outside over 
open fires. Assorted cured and fresh meats from the tail to the snout, the hock 
to the loin are cooked with onions, garlic and herbs and stewed in their own 
broth. 
</P>
<P>
 In fancier presentations, loins and steaks are roasted or grilled. They all 
accompany the pots of plain white rice and the richly flavored beans. In most 
restaurants, each of the pots is labeled in Portuguese, and in some places 
English, so the orelha (ears) can be differentiated from the costeletas (chops) 
and the carne seca (dried meat) from the pe (pork foot). 
</P>
<P>
 Couve, a pot of bright green shredded kale, adds color to the buffet filled 
with dark brown meat. A bowl of chili salsa fires heat into the robust dishes. 
Orange slices are a palate-cleansing refreshment. Farofa meal sits in bowls on 
the table, and diners stir it into the bean and meat sauces on their plates. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the buffet includes an extravagant variety of salads, cold cuts, 
vegetables, fruits and pastries. The feijoada is followed by desserts made of 
fresh coconut, cooked yams and Brazilian chocolate. At the end, an 
espresso-size cup of excellent, sugar-sweetened cafezinho (coffee) is the 
perfect chaser to the afternoon of feasting. 
</P>
<P>
 While the hotels and two restaurants mentioned below may not be as authentic 
as home-cooked meals of this kind, they make up in abundance and/or 
availability what they might lack in authenticity. And all are found in 
locations where tourists feel relatively safe -- regrettably an issue in 
modern-day Rio. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it's a little less luxurious than some of the other hotels, my 
favorite feijoada is the Caesar Park Hotel in Ipanema. Stepping out of the 
elevator and into the third-floor dining room, my husband and I were greeted by 
a smiling hostess dressed in white lacy flounces and a sparkling turban -- the 
traditional dress of a woman from the Brazilian state of Bahia. She led us into 
the parlor to sip an appetizer cup of rich, salty black bean soup and to offer 
us a choice of batidas.  
</P>
<P>
 Inside the formal dining room with a grand view of the beach below was a 
10-foot buffet with oversize floral arrangements flaunting an abundance of 
banana palms and birds of paradise. On either side of the centerpiece, rows of 
cast-iron caldrons issued enticing aromas. Whether dishing up their food or 
sitting at their tables, the well-dressed patrons -- mostly Rio natives, I was 
told -- were laughing and clapping to the fast beat of musicians belting out 
seductive sambas. 
</P>
<P>
 The price of the feijoada completa was about $22, although prices can 
fluctuate wildly due to the volatility of the Brazilian cruzeiro. Caesar Park 
was among the most expensive of the places I tried, but it was worth it because 
it felt almost like experiencing the meal at someone's home. 
</P>
<P>
 The legendary Copacabana Palace Hotel is the place to tread in the footsteps 
of the rich and famous, and at about $24, the Copacabana's feijoada is a 
bargain when you remember that you are dining in the shadows of Lana Turner, 
Ali Kahn and Tyrone Power, who were known to patronize this classy 
establishment. It still draws an international clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 The dress is casual/elegant and diners are decidedly well-appointed. The white 
of the facade of this landmark 1920s masterpiece is duplicated inside the 
Pergulia Restaurant, where white latticework and tablecloths provide the 
backdrop for earthenware casseroles on wrought-iron stands. The dining room 
opens up to an outdoor eating arena on the ground floor next to the swimming 
pool. It was there that we drank batidas made from passion fruit and coconut 
milk and sipped bean soup out of terra-cotta cups, while eating torrado de alho 
(tiny toasts sprinkled with garlic). 
</P>
<P>
 To music with a bossa nova beat, we filled our plates from eight-foot round 
tables decorated with orchids and ferns. In addition to the beans, rice and 
meat, which included smoked tongue and chateaubriand, there were banana 
fritters, fried plantains and a dessert display that could have come from a 
French patisserie. 
</P>
<P>
 A little further up the wide street that separates the famous beach from the 
high-rises is my third choice for feijoada . Passing between the sidewalk 
curio, beach towel and T-shirt stalls makes for a colorful meander on the way 
to the Rio Palace Hotel, with its jungle-like atmosphere, complete with indoor 
waterfalls and potted banana palms. 
</P>
<P>
 The 40-foot-long buffet that draws tourists from all over the world is decked 
out with orchids and oversize stuffed parrots that add color to the long line 
of bubbling stainless chafing dishes. The feijoada price is about $18 and we 
finished the rather ordinary -- but still tasty -- meal with slices of 
pineapple and bowls of tapioca, while gazing out at the view of bronzed bodies 
on white sand and gently lapping surf. 
</P>
<P>
 In Copacabana is another hotel restaurant with praiseworthy feijoada . Cafe de 
la Paix on the first floor of the Meridien Hotel has a wide variety of foods, 
some of which were not exactly authentic but good, and a family-friendly 
atmosphere . . . for $15 per person. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon arrival, a hostess dressed in a wildly ruffled dress painted in primary 
colors met us at the door, poured our batidas from a pitcher and filled little 
cups with soup before we even sat down in the busy, booth-lined dining room. 
Families with small children abounded and later we found out why. Because it 
was Easter week, the adjacent bar was being turned into a puppet theater with 
scary and humorous animal stories for the children. 
</P>
<P>
 Two buffet tables awaited, laden with more feijoada , including an impressive 
selection of vegetables, Westernized for tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 On the hot buffet, black cast-iron caldrons holding the beans and rice, the 
sausages, fresh and cured cuts of pork and beef, sauteed greens and fried 
plantains were set on woven grass mats. Each pot had labels in Portuguese and 
English. On the cold table, hand-crafted terra-cotta bowls held pates, salads, 
avocados, mangoes, cheeses and sliced meats, corn, carrots, pumpkin and 
black-eyed peas. 
</P>
<P>
 Another place that would work for families or for anyone remotely concerned 
about Rio's safety for tourists is the restaurant in the new Sheraton Hotel, 
built on the beach side of Avenue Neimeyer, on the road to Sao Conrado, south 
of Ipanema. Secure from the street intensity of Rio, the Sheraton is a world 
unto itself. It would be possible to check in here, enjoy the food and drink 
that beckons so many tourists to Brazil, take in a spectacular view of Ipanema 
Beach and never be touched by the intense poverty of the streets or the 
pastel-painted favelas (slums) clinging to the hillside across from the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 In an airy setting with a 180-degree view, the coffee-shop-style restaurant 
stretches in tiers leading up from the buffet. We sat on the level nearest the 
buffet that is surrounded by brass railings and larger-than-life plaster Bahian 
statues illuminated by tiny lights. The atmosphere is informal and the buffet 
carries on from noon until 4 a.m., with all the accouterments, including 
piped-in sambas and classical piano concertos. The food is not exceptional, but 
all the dishes are included and it costs about $22. The main draw is its 
dramatic and beautiful setting. 
</P>
<P>
 If a Saturday feijoada doesn't fit into your itinerary, there are options. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant Casa da Feijoada in Copacabana serves an abbreviated version 
daily. Leonarda Miranda Braga, who returned to Rio in the late '80s after 
living in California for five years, opened this neighborhood restaurant to 
cater to feijoada lovers who want a table-size version any day of the week. The 
restaurant will even deliver to your hotel room in take-out containers. Open 
noon till midnight, the tiny establishment serves "feijoada traditional" for 
about $11, which includes a cup of black bean soup followed by a divided 
terra-cotta platter offering fried pig skin, mixed meats (order all or just the 
kinds you like), beans, rice, farofa, sauteed collard greens, fried yucca 
sticks and sliced oranges. 
</P>
<P>
 On Fridays there are two options. 
</P>
<P>
 One is worth going to as much for the setting as for the food. It's the 
Assiriurs Cafe do Teatro and it could be in Paris. The fresco tile walls and 
floors, Art Deco mirrors and intricately carved pillars, all in colors of 
cocoa, cinnamon, guava and mango, contribute a cool relief to the noontime 
swelter in this Rio landmark on the ground floor of the famous Municipal 
Theatre. A place to dress in suit and tie, heels and silk, Cafe do Teatro is a 
must-dine spot and the Friday feijoada for about $11 is one way to do it. 
Although I missed eating it, I did make it in for a drink and to admire the 
beauty of the setting. 
</P>
<P>
 The other place for Friday feijoada is the Golden Park Hotel in the Gloria 
district, about a 10-minute taxi drive south of downtown. It presents a classic 
feijoada buffet that caters to business people from nearby offices and 
out-of-towners staying at the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The price is around $10. The buffet in the center of the low-ceiling room is 
set with 20 or so cast-iron caldrons. Each is labeled in Portuguese so the cuts 
of meat can be differentiated because all the meats, except the ribs, are 
boned. I love the low-key and serious approach to the dishes, dining with the 
local office workers and the impeccable service of the staff. 
</P>
<P>
 After the feijoada, a stroll is imperative. We joined couples and families for 
a promenade along the wide storefront sidewalks, fronting the hotels. After 
all, as anyone who has visited a Rio beach knows, keeping in shape is another 
Brazilian ritual. GUIDEBOOK

OUR SECOND ANNUAL: TOURS FOR THE THINKING PERSON; ANATOMY OF A SOUTHWEST TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA W. SILVERMAN, Silverman is a free-lance writer based in Pleasantville, 
N.Y. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Our group of 28, including four tour staff members, assembled in Albuquerque 
at the Sheraton Old Town this past June. Artisans, teachers, a television 
producer, social worker, writer, musician, business executives and homemakers, 
we had come from communities as disparate as Rochester, N.Y., and Kodiak, 
Alaska, to join the Art and Archeology of the Southwest field seminar offered 
by Crow Canyon Archeological Research Center in Cortez, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 I had become caught up in the explosion of interest in the native arts and 
cultures of the American Southwest and figured, where better to learn about 
them than on the reservations and in the pueblos and hill towns of the Four 
Corners region. Other participants had their own expectations: Some jokingly 
tagged the trip a "buying frenzy" and confessed to traveling single because 
their spouse "hates to shop." 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-day program took us into the homes and workshops of prominent Southwest 
Native American and Latino artists and craftspeople, the back rooms of fabled 
"real West" trading posts and the controlled confines of scholarly research 
institutions and knowledgeable dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 Marti Hopkins Struever, the seminar leader, was a dynamo who had achieved 
success as a dealer in Native American art. She had encouraged the careers of 
many leading artisans, and the seminar rested on her connections. She was 
warmly welcomed wherever we went, and the warmth enfolded us, too. At dinner 
the first evening, Marti provided an overview of the trip. Reading materials 
were handed out on the art forms we would study, a supplement to the hefty 
literature sent earlier to our homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day set the pattern for the trip. The morning began with a talk in a 
hotel meeting room by Dr. J. J. Brody, a University of New Mexico expert on the 
Anasazi, the "ancient ones," ancestors of most of today's Pueblos, and on 
Southwest pottery. On subsequent days, Jonathan Batkin, the director of Santa 
Fe's Wheelwright Museum, would speak on Pueblo and Navajo weaving; Charles 
Carillo, a Latino historian and santero (carver of saints and other folk 
figures), on Spanish colonial history and arts, and Gail Bird, a noted jewelry 
designer, on Southwest Native American jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 Following each talk, we took to the road, crisscrossing the starkly beautiful 
high-desert region between New Mexico, Colorado and Arizona (which, with Utah, 
make up the Four Corners region) in comfortable, air-conditioned vans. Marti 
and Mel Monkelis, an exceptionally accommodating fellow with a terrific, if 
quirky, humor, and two energetic women from Crow Canyon's volunteer corps drove 
and provided a steady stream of commentary as we sped by crimson sandstone 
cliffs, cucumber-green stands of pinyon pine and juniper, bleached plateaus and 
places such as the Chuska Mountains, Shiprock and Abiquiu. 
</P>
<P>
 Our first stop was at the restored 18th-Century mission church in Zuni, 
largest of the Southwest's 19 pueblos, off New Mexico 53 in the state's remote 
west. We were greeted there by artist Alex Seowtewa, who, with his sons, has 
been painting murals of tribal kachinas (spirit figures) on the church walls 
for the last 17 years. As we sat in the pews, awed by the monumental figures 
emerging from all sides, the artist explained the Zuni mythology he has 
dedicated his life to depicting. 
</P>
<P>
 At once excited and sobered by our first experience, we moved on to the home 
of the Quandelacy family, some of the leading carvers of the animal fetishes 
(amulets) for which the Zuni are known. 
</P>
<P>
 In Gallup, 35 miles north via New Mexico 602, a homely town as weathered as a 
mystic cowboy, we entered the cool precincts of Richardson's Pawn and Trading, 
a leading trader to the Native American people. Sequestered behind the 
jam-packed showcases glittering with silver jewelry, belt buckles, bowls and 
dolls lies the pawn vault. For more than a century, pawn has been the Southwest 
Native Americans' credit and safe-deposit system, providing both needed funds 
and safe-keeping. 
</P>
<P>
 Window Rock, Ariz., seat of the Navajo Nation, is 30 minutes northwest of 
Gallup. After a night there, notable for a demonstration of the artistry of 
Navajo silversmith Norbert Peshlakai, we drove by the copper-hued monolith with 
the large doughnut hole that gives the town its name and headed for Hubbell 
Trading Post in Ganado. A National Historic Site, Hubbell's has encouraged 
Navajo weavers and sold quality rugs since 1876. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hopi Mesas, three sere, desolate fingers jutting out from Black Mesa over 
the vast surrounding Navajo Reservation, were our home base for two days. The 
Hopi Cultural Center satisfied our basic needs with a newly renovated motel and 
a restaurant. From there we drove down a series of unmarked dirt roads to the 
remote, Second Mesa homestead of Helen Naha, "Feather Woman," a renowned 
70-year-old potter.  
</P>
<P>
 Other visits followed in rapid succession: to the homes of famed potter Dextra 
Quotskuyva Nampeyo, a Hopi coiled basket maker, and Sonwai, successor to 
legendary Hopi jeweler Charles Loloma, and to the studio of respected kachina 
carvers Ron and Brian Honyouti. We had a brief introduction to the subject of 
Hopi kachinas and dashed to the Hopi village of Moenkopi, where we were 
rewarded with a view of the waning minutes of a kachina dance. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, at Victor Beck's sheep camp in Pinon, Ariz., members of the extended 
family rallied to greet us. We were invited into a nearby hogan, the 
traditional Navajo dome-shaped dwelling, where Victor's mother, Ellen, sat 
carding and spinning wool from her sheep. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinner that evening was back in New Mexico at San Juan pueblo. We were still 
smacking our lips from the veritable banquet prepared by the women at the Oke 
Oweenge Crafts Cooperative when we arrived at the Inn on the Alameda at Santa 
Fe. Some of our group dashed forthwith to the popular galleries on the Plaza 
and along Canyon Road to compare their prices for ceramics and jewelry with 
what we had paid on the reservations for comparable work (two to three times 
higher was the consensus). Others took in Santa Fe's famed museums and historic 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
 We then switched gears and turned to Hispanic New Mexico. Charles Carillo 
provided background on the Hispanic Southwest and joined us for the scenic 
drive to the bucolic hill town of Chimayo, one of several pastoral villages 
whose relative inaccessibility until the second half of the 20th Century 
allowed them to tenaciously hold onto 400-year-old Spanish mores. Here, it is 
said, 16th-Century Spanish is still spoken. 
</P>
<P>
 The workshop of Irvin Trujillo, a seventh-generation weaver, afforded us our 
first glimpse at one aspect of a veritable cultural treasure -- one-of-a-kind 
weavings in the historic Rio Grande style. 
</P>
<P>
 At our farewell dinner, Marti pulled out an end-of-the-trip quiz. For that 
moment at least, we knew all the answers. But many more questions had arisen to 
take their place. The answers would have to wait for another time. GUIDEBOOK

HIKING: SANTA CLARITA VALLEY: A SANTA SUSANA MOUNTAIN RETREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The natural attractions of the Santa Susana Mountains are many. North-facing 
slopes are covered with coast live-oak woodland; south-facing slopes present 
panoramas of coastal sage scrub, and both faces have ample grasslands. The 
upper ramparts of the range have a rich population of valley oak, considered by 
many to be the most beautiful variety of quercus . 
</P>
<P>
 Conservationists are attempting to create a 6,000-acre Santa Clarita Woodlands 
preserve within the mountains. They are off to a modest start with the 
preservation of part of Towsley Canyon, a tranquil retreat on the north side of 
the Santa Susanas, just out of sight and earshot of busy Interstate 5.  
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Susanas are an east-west range bordered on the south by the San 
Fernando Valley and on the north by Newhall, Valencia and the fast-growing 
Santa Clarita Valley. Conservationists have suggested that the range -- whose 
middle and upper reaches are undeveloped except for a few oil wells and ranches 
-- resembles the Santa Monica Mountains of 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The comparison with the Santa Monicas reveals some interesting differences. 
The highest peak in the Santa Susanas (Oat Mountain) reaches 3,740 feet; the 
Santa Monicas can claim only one peak higher than 3,000 feet, and most of the 
range is considerably lower. A second difference: While the Santa Monicas are 
chaparral-cloaked, oak and grassland predominate in much of the Santa Susanas. 
</P>
<P>
 The park in the canyon is named for longtime Los Angeles police chief and 
state Sen. Ed Davis, who authored legislation funding the purchase of Towsley 
Canyon in 1989. The park is administered by the Mountains Recreation and 
Conservation Authority, under the auspices of the Santa Monica Mountains 
Conservancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Docents lead guided family nature hikes (reservations not required) on some 
weekends. Walks last about two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Stop at the Sonia Thompson Nature Center, a small facility with nature and 
history exhibits. Towsley Canyon Lodge, which sleeps 18 and comes complete with 
meeting rooms and swimming pool, is available for rental by interested groups. 
For lodge reservations, call (805) 255-2974. 
</P>
<P>
 Directions to trail head: From Interstate 5 in Newhall, exit on Calgrove 
Boulevard. Turn west, then proceed south on the Old Road half a mile to the 
signed entrance for Ed Davis Park/Towsley Canyon and turn right. Continue 
another half-mile to the small parking lot near the nature center. 
</P>
<P>
 The hike: Canyon View Loop Trail begins near a seasonal creek, just east of 
the nature center. In short order, the path will take you through or near the 
various plant communities typical of the Santa Susana Mountains: grassland, 
coastal scrub and oak woodland. 
</P>
<P>
 The path climbs south, then east, up a hogback ridge. Ridge-top views include 
the impressive canyon rock formations and the burgeoning Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll descend from the ridge and bear left onto Wiley Canyon Trail, then make 
another left onto the park entrance road to return to the trail head. Canyon 
View Loop Trail, Wiley Canyon Trail 
</P>
<P>
 WHERE: Ed Davis Park, Towsley Canyon, Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 DISTANCE: 2 miles round trip. 
</P>
<P>
 TERRAIN: Oak and walnut woodland, prominent rock formations. 
</P>
<P>
 HIGHLIGHTS: Dramatic vistas, tranquillity just off interstate 5. 
</P>
<P>
 DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY: Easy

BACKPACK & BUDGET; MALTA, A MEDITERRANEAN MECCA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Malta, a small archipelago in the middle of the Mediterranean Sea, has a 
student/youth travel service that provides travelers with inexpensive 
accommodations and also offers year-round diving programs in its crystal-clear 
waters. 
</P>
<P>
 Located 58 miles south of the Italian island of Sicily and 179 miles from 
North Africa, Malta consists of three inhabited islands -- Malta, Gozo and 
Comino -- and two other uninhabited isles. Malta can be reached by ferry from 
Sicily in eight hours for about $31, or by high-speed catamaran in less than 
two hours for $47. 
</P>
<P>
 Most inhabitants speak English, and the winters are mild with an average 
temperature of 57 degrees. The summer average rises to 86. 
</P>
<P>
 The main island of Malta, which measures 17 miles by 9 miles, has neither 
mountains nor rivers. You'll see a landscape of low hills with terraced fields 
on the slopes. Gozo is greener, quieter and more rustic. Tiny Comino is home to 
only a handful of farmers. Comino and Gozo are linked to Malta by ferry. 
</P>
<P>
 The prehistoric inhabitants of Malta built impressive temples using gigantic 
stones that have been dated to 3,600 BC -- about 1,000 years before the 
Egyptian pyramids. Ruins are still visible. Exactly how the objects were lifted 
and moved remains a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of its strategic position and excellent harbor, Malta was once one of 
the Mediterranean's most important ports. 
</P>
<P>
 The seas around Malta are virtually tideless and extremely clear (visibility 
averages 100 feet). With those conditions, as well as a sea temperature that 
never drops below 55 degrees in winter, diving has become a popular pastime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maltese student travel service, NSTS, offers international travelers a 
beginner's diving course that leads to an open-water diving certificate, 
costing about $310. The fee includes equipment and lectures. 
</P>
<P>
 NSTS operates four hostels on Malta. Visitors who want to participate in the 
dive program are urged to stay in dormitory rooms at the hostels in Sliema or 
St. Julian's because of their proximity to the diving center. 
</P>
<P>
 The hostel in Sliema, Hibernia House, is on Depiro Street (from the United 
States, telephone 011-356-33-3859). The 1994 rate for bed and breakfast is 
about $4.50-$6.60 per night. 
</P>
<P>
 In St. Julian's, the Pinto Youth Hostel is on Sacred Heart Avenue (tel. 
011-356-31-3897). The nightly rate (breakfast included) runs about $6-$10. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostels are also in the Maltese towns of Fgura and Rabat. A fifth hostel is 
expected to open soon on Gozo. Contact NSTS Student and Youth Travel, 220 St. 
Paul St., Valletta VLT 07, Malta, tel. 011- 356-24-4983, fax 011-356-23-0330. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, contact the Malta National Tourist Organization, 249 
East 35th St., New York 10016; tel. (212) 213-6686. Or see the Cadogan guide to 
Malta ($12.95, Globe Pequot) or the 20-page Malta chapter of "Mediterranean 
Europe on a Shoestring" ($24.95, Lonely Planet).

 A big hit with senior travelers last year was the successful series "1940s 
Remembered" big-band theme cruises aboard American Hawaii's ships the 
Independence and the Constitution. The seven-day cruises will be repeated this 
year, with visiting celebrities from Hollywood's 1940s era. Theme orchestras 
this year will include the Benny Goodman Tribute Orchestra; Swing and Sway with 
Sammy Kaye, led by Roger Thorpe, and Les Elgart's orchestra. Ships will feature 
period memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruise ships depart Honolulu and stop at Hilo and Kona on the Big Island of 
Hawaii; at Kahului, Maui, and at Nawiliwili, Kauai. Sailing dates are May 7, 14 
and 21; Nov. 26, and Dec. 3 and 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Passengers traveling alone this year can get inside deluxe staterooms for a 
supplement of only $100, replacing the previous 60% single-supplement charge. 
Per-person prices are determined by stateroom location and range $995-$1,895 
for the cruise only. Round-trip air fare from Los Angeles to Honolulu is $349. 
Grandparents are advised that children 16 and under sail free if they share a 
cabin with adults in certain cabin categories, or they can get a 50% reduction 
for their own cabin. Shore excursions are extra.  
</P>
<P>
 Cruise/resort vacations can be booked, combining a three-day cruise with a 
four-day land package or a four-day cruise and three-day land package. For

HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 That Kenneth Turan included the Simon Wiesenthal Center Museum of Tolerance in 
his story ("Viewing the Unthinkable," Dec. 12) is understandable. It allowed 
him to point out why he favors the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles has yet another Holocaust museum: The Martyrs Memorial and 
Holocaust Museum in the Jewish Federation Council community building. Small in 
comparison to the others, it tells the Holocaust story most effectively, and 
ties it to Jewish life in Europe and world history. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does it, as a Holocaust museum, dare translate "House of the Holocaust" 
into a "Museum of Tolerance." 
</P>

<P>
 Kenneth Turan's curiously incurious reportage recalled my strong misgivings 
about the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum, that have troubled me since my visit 
there in August. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Despite telling moments, the museum . . . insidiously camouflages, 
trivializes, even glamorizes the consummate evil we call the Holocaust. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 As I followed the designers' route through the exhibits, a sense of 
accumulating falseness was only relieved by the occasional line of poetry or 
prose, image or unadorned artifact whose presences resonated with authenticity. 
It came as a relief to reach the building's handsomely simple memorial rotunda, 
away from the exhibits' slick, patronizing artifice.  
</P>
<P>
 I believe the museum fails both in its pervasive distortion and in 
hubristically attempting what cannot be done -- monumental chutzpah, Allan 
Dershowitz might say. 
</P>
<P>
 While for some the Holocaust Museum may accomplish a necessary good, I believe 
that its facile theatrics ultimately insulate viewers from the significance of 
the aggregate acts of individual will which are the museum's putative subject.

 To know that Dr. Gunnar E. Christiansen of Anaheim is an ophthalmologist is to 
know only half of the story. Twelve years ago, he started putting together free 
travelogues for homebound senior citizens. Today he does them for both shut-ins 
and the hundreds who come to his public shows."I'll probably retire soon, but 
I'll keep doing the travelogues," he says. One of his recent shows centered on 
Paris, which he had just visited for the first time. "We were at the top of the 
Centre Pompidou, where the plaza attracts many street performers and mimes. I 
looked down and saw this fire eater. I ran down the stairs and got there just 
in the nick of time. I only got the one shot." Needless to say, it's in his 
travelogue.

NOBODY KNOWS THE TROUBLE THEY'LL SEE; RUSSIA 2010: AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR THE 
WORLD, BY DANIEL YERGIN & THANE GUSTAFSON (RANDOM HOUSE: $23; 320 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By A. Craig Copetas, A. Craig Copetas, winner of the 1990 Olive Branch Award 
for his work as Moscow correspondent for Regardie's Magazine, is the author of 
Bear Hunting With the Politburo and a former visiting scholar at the Harriman 
Institute of Advanced Soviet Study at Columbia University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am perhaps not alone in thinking a Cold War needs to be declared on books 
filled with motivational anecdotes that offer American and Russian leaders 
inspiration. Once an author gets anywhere near to mentioning streamlined 
nuclear deterrent strategies, or divulging on the dust cover that my $23 will 
buy a read which "grew out of a confidential study developed for a select group 
of international companies by a leading international consulting firm," it's 
time to sound a Red Alert. 
</P>
<P>
 'Russia 2010" is yet another foundation-grant spinner in the perpetual motion 
of Russia/ex-USSR books. Its tragedy is twofold: It misses a huge and untouched 
constituency of book-buyers who, though curious about Russia, are anesthetized 
by tautological surveys; and, perhaps more consequential, this type of hyped 
discourse mugs State Department analysts (who blundered in predicting Mikhail 
Gorbachev, Boris Yeltsin, the 1991 putsch, and the 1993 artillery barrage) into 
conceiving what-it-means-for-the-world Russian strategies like medieval monks 
locked in a cloister. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-authors Daniel Yergin, a 1992 Pulitzer Prize winner for his book "The 
Prize," and Thane Gustafson, a Georgetown University professor and former 
think-tanker at the Rand Corp., seem to enjoy drowning in the Russia chaos they 
want so hard to save us from. After balling together enough Russian yarns to 
stuff a bear, they unwind these wet narratives around projected events to 
create four possible life forms to inhabit Future Russia. The technique is 
called "scenario planning," a drill developed at Shell Oil in the early 1970s 
and now popular among consulting firms and military forecasters to calculate "a 
structured, disciplined method for thinking about the future."  
</P>
<P>
 So what's new in "2010"? Not much, especially for those who've taken the time 
to be haunted by Brian Cox's recent "Salem to Moscow," or mesmerized by the 
prescience in any of W. Bruce Lincoln's histories of the early days of 
Bolshevism. Indeed, the MTV crowd would learn more by spending a couple of 
bucks for the late Frank Zappa's 1989 Financial News Network reports on how to 
develop trade with the USSR. 
</P>
<P>
 The four "scenarios" are imaginative graduate-school exercises, but alongside 
the elegant calisthenics of "Rethinking the Soviet Experience" by Stephen 
Cohen, "Russia 2010" has as much original power and fury as "The Little Engine 
That Could." 
</P>
<P>
 What's angering about "Russia 2010" is that Yergin and Gustafson have all the 
professional gear to be the Lewis & Clarke of the new Russia, yet they wade 
around in Russia's entrails, sometimes divining prophecy like guest experts on 
McNeil/Lehrer, at other times sounding like the holiday tourist who acquires 
expertise through a long night drinking with apparatchiks aboard the Red Arrow 
train between Moscow and St. Petersburg.  
</P>
<P>
 The authors maintain, for example, that whatever precise form Russian 
capitalism takes, by 2010 it will be a force to be reckoned with in the world 
economy. "Increasingly, Russian will be a language heard in the financial 
district, the industrial fairs, the business hotels, and the ski slopes and 
beaches of the world." Such declarative wisdom, especially from a Pulitzer 
Prize winner, is an intellectual misdemeanor. In discussing Russia's prime 
movers, the term used in scenario development for the actors able to alter the 
game, they go for the felony: "As powerful as organized crime has become in 
Russia the last few years, it is not a prime mover in the fate of Russia and 
will not become one." This kind of announcement is rooted in the disingenuous 
belief made popular during the Industrial Revolution that society needs a few 
crooks to amass wealth so that later generations can afford to grow into 
law-abiding capitalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Each Future Russia scenario is written in Milton-Bradley prose, game boards 
included. Muddling Down, in which Russia disintegrates, is Chutes & Ladders; 
Two-Headed Eagle, in which Russia becomes a militaristic plutocracy, is 
Stratego; Time of Troubles is Risk for real; and Chudo (Russian for miracle) is 
a convincing Candyland. Players in each game are required to accept such basic 
instructions as, "The core of the Soviet system has been obliterated. The 
Communist ideology and its center of power, the apparatus of the Communist 
Party of the Soviet Union, have been destroyed." This might float in an oil 
company think tank, but anyone who's done hard time in Russia will smile at 
such a notion.  
</P>
<P>
 In varying degrees, Yergin and Gustafson underpin each sandcastle scenario 
with the assumption that the ruble can be gauged with an aerodynamic precision, 
neglecting to consider the drag of conservative estimates that show half the 
$31.7 billion Russia earned from exports in 1992 (and nearly three times the $6 
billion designated by the World Bank for stabilizing the ruble) fleeing Russia 
in the same year. A country's currency is only as strong as the goods produced 
by its economy, and money remains robust through reinvestment, not capital 
flight. Russia manufactures nothing the West wants. The Siberian El Dorado is 
too expensive for sufficient exploitation; moreover, the price of reaching, 
harvesting and transporting this red herring is too cost intensive to pay back 
Western investors while concurrently fueling the velocity of immediate hard 
currency Russia needs to catapult its 150 million people into the 21st Century. 
As for the coherent economic policy necessary to glue an economic miracle 
together by 2010, forget it. Russia is still debating how best to invent the 
wheel while jets zoom overhead, and for Yergin and Gustafson even momentarily 
to apply Wall Street wizardry to the ruble is to scumble the basic grammar of 
Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Yergin and Gustafson are obsessive to the point of desperation to hold 
that Russia should be considered a Western-style country. Between the lines of 
all four scenarios lurks the view that the demise of systemic communism 
automatically gave Russian leaders a right to be judged as amateur democrats. 
By the most liberal of Western political and economic standards, Russian 
leaders are dangerous, Barnum & Bailey with nuclear weapons. That's the reality 
of Russian realpolitik, and it won't get you invited to a Russian Embassy 
cocktail party. Tactful? No, but notarized in whispers by more Western 
diplomats than one might imagine. 
</P>
<P>
 There are certainly democrats and economic reformers in Russia, but not in the 
boxcar loads necessary to pull off the socioeconomic miracle the authors fancy 
throughout and try to sell in the final chapter. "What follows is a snapshot 
taken along Russia's road to the market," Yergin and Gustafson begin in the 
urgent pomp of a full page, italicized epigram. "These are not scenarios. The 
people are real, and their words are their own. Except for the tycoon Neverov, 
only their names and a few details have been changed for their own protection . 
"  
</P>
<P>
 Then, in this "Dragnet" style, comes the phenomenal tale of young Ivan, a 
Russian entrepreneur under mafia pressure to turn $200,000 worth of Western 
goods over to heavily armed cutthroats. Blistering barnacles! Ivan calls in the 
KGB, who put a recording device on him. The mysterious gangsters are escorted 
away in handcuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like an American film," says Ivan. "If there wasn't a KGB, the mafia 
would be in control. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never dreamed about the future," he says at the end of the visit. "And I 
don't dream about the future now. There's a Russian proverb -- that a drunken 
sailor can come and knock everything over." 
</P>
<P>
 Cartoon-bubble reportage with a moral is a fine way to end "The Adventures of 
Tintin in the Land of the Soviets," but certainly not a book that offers 
authoritative jacket blurbs by former U.S. Ambassador Robert Strauss and former 
Defense and Energy Secretary James Schlesinger. It makes an old Moscow 
correspondent wonder who's been kidding whom all these years. If Yergin and 
Gustafson had hoped to leave us with an electric parable on a Russian miracle, 
they would have done better to locate and identify Ivan's tormentors, and find 
out how much it cost them to get back into the miracle economy. In Russian, 
it's called kto kovo , and it's a shame the authors, who pepper "Russia 2010" 
with selected Russian-language aphorisms, failed to check out this phrase 
before concluding "the state never quite managed to control the black market." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, there's an influential category of individuals who will regard a 
book termed "visionary and provocative" by Richard Nixon on the dust jacket as 
deserving more than cynicism honed on reporting Moscow's mean streets and 
Gorbachev/Yeltsin press conferences. If you count yourself among this 
distinguished group, I respectfully paraphrase what the late U.S. ambassador 
Chip Bohlen had to say over a poker game at Spasso House, "The only people to 
beware of in life are those who say I never get drunk on champagne, and the 
ones who want to tell you what's going to happen in Russia."

SELLING OUT; ARE ENVIRONMENTALISTS IN CHARGE OF THEIR AGENDA, OR ARE THEY IN 
THE BUSINESS OF COMPROMISE?; FORCING THE SPRING: THE TRANSFORMATION OF THE 
AMERICAN ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT, BY ROBERT GOTTLIEB (ISLAND PRESS: $27.50; 412 
PP.) ; NOT IN OUR BACKYARD: THE PEOPLE AND EVENTS THAT SHAPED AMERICA'S MODERN 
ENVIRONMENTAL MOVEMENT, BY MARC MOWREY AND TIM REDMOND (WILLIAM MORROW: $28; 
352 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ronald Brownstein, Ronald Brownstein is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Taken together, "Forcing the Spring" and "Not in Our Backyard" represent a 
policy junkie's Whole Earth Catalogue: They offer a panoramic compilation of 
the environmental critique of contemporary American society.  
</P>
<P>
 It's a critique of striking breadth. At any given moment, lobbyists, 
scientists and lawyers marching under the green banner are challenging how we 
grow and distribute food; heat our homes, power our factories and fuel our 
cars; use natural lands; dispose of wastes in water, air and land; treat other 
species; and manage new technologies, from nuclear power to genetic 
engineering. No other mainstream social movement -- not the labor, civil 
rights, feminist or consumer movements -- questions so many distinct aspects of 
American life. 
</P>
<P>
 For both Robert Gottlieb and the team of Marc Mowrey and Tim Redmond, however, 
that critique isn't broad enough. At a time when environmentalism appears 
ascendant -- with sympathetic ears in the White House and a public profile so 
unimpeachable that even Hollywood moguls who lumber to work in gas-guzzling 
limousines write checks for the cause -- both of these books portray it as a 
faltering force. Both see the large environmental groups such as the Sierra 
Club and the Natural Resources Defense Council as elitist, insular, too quick 
to compromise, and insensitive to women, workers and "people of color." Both 
put their sympathies with local organizations that mobilize grass-roots 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Gottlieb, in particular, is frustrated by the course of contemporary green 
politics. In this perceptive and challenging book, he has chosen a fresh 
vantage point from which to view the history of environmentalism: its success 
at linking with other dissident groups, from consumer organizations to labor 
unions, to challenge what he terms "the dominant urban and industrial order." 
</P>
<P>
 In arenas as diverse as urban planning, protection of the wilderness, and the 
safeguarding of clean drinking water, Gottlieb finds a constant tension between 
those who would manage specific environmental insults with regulation, and 
those who view such dangers as manifestations of a broader problem: an 
imbalance of power in society that gives business too much influence over 
workers, communities and resources.  
</P>
<P>
 Almost always, Gottlieb concludes, those who would narrow environmentalism's 
prism have prevailed. So by 1914, early activists agitating against the 
industrial pollution of rivers and streams had lost control of the clean water 
debate to those promoting filtration and chlorination as the solution; in the 
1920s the movement to create "Garden Cities" as planned communities with lands 
held in public trust shriveled into support for more parklands, and shrubs 
along the medians of highways. 
</P>
<P>
 In Gottlieb's eyes, the same pattern persists today. With their extensive 
presence in Washington, their close relationships with regulatory and 
Congressional policy-makers, their reliance on technical experts and 
litigation, and their distance from grass-roots activists, Gottlieb sees the 
mainstream environmental organizations as isolated "interest groups" rather 
than elements of a social movement. By investing so heavily in managing the 
control of pollution through regulation, Gottlieb contends, the groups have 
effectively indentured themselves to the government as "the policy system's 
managers and caretakers." That regulatory approach, he concludes scornfully, 
represents "a containment strategy at best" that demonstrates "more the 
breadth, extent and costs of environmental hazards than any effective mechanism 
to reduce or eliminate them." 
</P>
<P>
 What's the alternative? Gottlieb finds inspiration in thinkers and activists 
such as Ralph Nader, Jesse Jackson, Barry Commoner and labor leader Tony 
Mazzocchi who situate environmental issues in the broader question of limiting 
corporate power. Even more, Gottlieb contends that environmentalism's future is 
heralded by the grass-roots, anti-toxics groups that have emerged around the 
country, and formed loose networks like the National Toxics Campaign. In these 
militant neighborhood organizations -- often led by women, frequently located 
in lower middle-income and minority neighborhoods and typically suspicious of 
government, business and the national conservation organizations -- Gottlieb 
spies "the beginnings of a new social movement" distinct from the 
overwhelmingly white, upper-middle class constituency of traditional 
environmentalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Mowrey and Redmond share Gottlieb's preferences, but not his analytic 
discipline. The energetic research they invested in this history of 
environmentalism over the past quarter century is largely defeated by 
deficiencies of style and structure. The book careens from character to 
character in short mock-cinematic chapters: It's a bit like watching a green 
version of the movie "Short Cuts." Just when someone becomes interesting (Amory 
Lovins, Dennis Hayes, Jerry Brown) they disappear, sometimes not to reappear 
for hundreds of pages, sometimes not at all. The authors compound their 
structural problems with a ham-handed pulpish writing style that relies heavily 
on portentous one-sentence paragraphs. As in: "And that's when the 
mild-mannered soil scientist decided to write to Earth First!" 
</P>
<P>
 As a writer, it's enough to make you swear off the stuff forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, almost in spite of itself, the book held my interest for long 
stretches. The case studies of ordinary people suddenly called to activism -- 
typically by a local environmental crisis -- reveals a process akin to 
religious conversion. But the authors' own ardor limits their perspective: if 
they have interviewed anyone who doesn't share their views on the environment, 
it's not apparent. Almost all the characters in the book are monochromatic: 
good local activists arrayed against bad businessmen, government officials and 
mainstream environmentalists.  
</P>
<P>
 Both books, in fact, are overly critical of the mainstream environmental 
organizations. Like any institution attempting to influence public policy, 
environmental organizations have compromised innumerable times over the years. 
But those compromises have helped to create the legal framework that 
grass-roots organizations use to challenge toxic waste dumps or demand 
government action to clean them up. For these authors to deny the successes of 
environmental organizations because environmental degradation continues is a 
bit like conservatives arguing that the persistence of poverty demonstrates 
that government is incapable of alleviating it. In each case, to frame an 
either/or choice is to obscure the space in between, where public policy can 
slowly shift trends in a positive direction. 
</P>
<P>
 In both books, but especially Gottlieb's, the dissatisfaction with the 
mainstream environmental groups seems to be a proxy for a much broader anxiety 
over the possibilities for left-of-liberal politics in the 1990s. In 
particular, Gottlieb -- who identifies himself as an alumnus of the Students 
for a Democratic Society and takes inordinate pains to trace the links between 
alternative environmental groups and the counterculture of the 1960s -- has 
written a plea for a new "New Left" that would use environmentalism as a base 
to design "new visions . . . about social transformation" and pursue what Barry 
Commoner called "the social governance of production decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Gottlieb never precisely defines such millennial terms, but it's clear he 
envisions a far more reaching assault on the basic structure of power in 
society than anything now given credence in American politics. Probably the 
closest analogue to the movement Gottlieb hopes to summon might be Jesse 
Jackson's Rainbow Coalition or the unwieldy anti-corporate coalition of labor 
unions, consumer groups, and some environmentalists that gathered to fight the 
North American Free Trade Agreement -- though I suspect there wouldn't be any 
room under his tent for conservative populists like Ross Perot and Patrick J. 
Buchanan. 
</P>
<P>
 What Gottlieb yearns for is a modern analogue to the old Industrial Workers of 
the World dream of One Big Union: he wants One Big Movement. It seems almost 
redundant to list the practical impediments -- divergent interests between 
labor and environmentalists when the protection of resources threatens jobs (as 
in the old growth forests of the Pacific Northwest); the debilitating tendency 
of the modern left (unfortunately embodied by Gottlieb himself) to view 
Americans more as representatives of antagonistic racial and sexual 
constituencies than as citizens with common needs and responsibilities. Add to 
all that the worldwide retreat of socialist parties (even China, after all, is 
welcoming entrepreneurs), and you couldn't find odds for a scenario under which 
a movement demanding greater "social governance" of corporate decisions emerges 
as a dominant political force. 
</P>
<P>
 But a schoolteacher who has discovered a toxic dump near her home doesn't 
worry about the tides of history. Environmentalism may never become the 
transforming social movement Gottlieb calls for; but it will remain an 
ineradicable piece of our political equation because it has instilled in the 
culture the belief that environmental hazards need not be allowed to stand. The 
most valuable contribution of both these books is to reaffirm the stubborn 
capacity of ordinary Americans effectively to challenge unresponsive power. The 
history of environmentalism over the past quarter century testifies to a single 
overriding fact: With enough tenacity and purpose, it is possible for a 
relatively small number of committed people to move this society -- imperfectly 
and unsteadily perhaps, but measurably and lastingly. Surely, as both these 
books assert, there is unfinished business in that history. But at a time when 
so many of our problems appear intractable, there is inspiration, too.

ONE MIGHT EXPECT A LOTTO WINNER TO SETTLE INTO A LIFE OF LUXURY. BUT WHEN ANDY 
VARGAS WON BIG . . . ; THEY ALL HIT THE JACKPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Before teeing off at the California Country Club in Industry, Andy Vargas took 
a brief detour and completed a ritual that has made him famous on the fairways. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding a crumpled plastic shopping bag, the 67-year-old businessman reached 
into a trash bin and began to scoop out empty soda and beer cans, as nearby 
golfers watched in wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh boy, look how many there are," Vargas said, sounding like a youngster who 
just stumbled upon a jar of treats. "We hit the jackpot, boys and girls." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not the first time Vargas had walked away with a jackpot. On Feb. 6, 
1988, after buying $15 worth of lottery tickets from a neighborhood store, 
Vargas won the $5.28-million grand prize in California's Super Lotto game. 
</P>
<P>
 A multimillion-dollar lottery winner might be expected to immediately retire 
into a life of luxury, but Vargas decided to share his fortune with others. 
Since hitting the jackpot, the Monterey Park resident has helped hundreds of 
people in Lincoln Heights and other Eastside communities, both directly and 
through a variety of charitable deeds -- one of which he started funding 
through the laborious process of recycling cans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Andy's famous. He's the man with the heart of gold," said James Allen, 
principal of Glen Alta Elementary School. "You don't see too many people like 
him anymore who truly want to help people and don't expect anything in return." 
</P>
<P>
 Even before becoming a millionaire, Vargas, who owned a small garment 
manufacturing business in Lincoln Heights for 25 years, did more than his share 
to help the community. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, after refusing to accept money for uniforms he made for the Glen Alta 
drill team, Vargas was asked if he would be willing to "adopt" the school 
through the Los Angeles Unified School District's Adopt-a-School program. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas, unaware that the program recruits businesses and individuals to assist 
schools, paused for a moment and then asked, "How many children do you need me 
to take home?" 
</P>
<P>
 "(The principal) said: '400,' and I thought: 'Oh my God,' " Vargas said. "But 
then she told me (details) about the program and I said OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas' first goal was to establish a college scholarship fund for Glen Alta 
graduates, in part because he dropped out of school after the eighth grade and 
always felt hindered by his limited education. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the only thing I would change in my life," said Vargas, who is married 
and has four grown children. "I would get as much education as I could, because 
you can never catch up." 
</P>
<P>
 To fund his scholarship foundation, Vargas started collecting aluminum cans. 
Although he collected 900 pounds in 18 months, his efforts earned him only 
$675. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in 1988, immediately after winning the lottery, Vargas contributed 
$20,000 of his first annual post-taxes check of $190,000 to his scholarship 
fund. Vargas has raised $70,000 for the fund, mostly proceeds from an annual 
fund-raising golf tournament he began in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, for the first time, Vargas awarded scholarships, ranging from $500 
to $1,000, to 15 high school seniors. Students who attended at least the fifth 
and sixth grades at Glen Alta Elementary and plan to continue their education 
after high school are eligible to receive a scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Andy's vision is to help any kid interested in going to college or a 
vocational program, regardless of their grades," Allen said. "When the first 
recipients of his scholarship were announced at the last tournament, Andy was 
just beaming. That's what he worked so hard for." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to creating the scholarship fund, Vargas was instrumental in 
getting Richard Riordan, then in private business, to donate $80,000 in 
computers and computer equipment to the school in 1991. Riordan, who was 
elected mayor of Los Angeles in April, made similar donations to schools 
throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas also regularly visits Glen Alta Elementary, which he adopted because of 
its proximity to his garment manufacturing businesses, and takes 40 students to 
McDonald's for lunch every year on Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from his involvement at the school, Vargas is president of the Lincoln 
Heights Optimist Club and is a board member of the Lincoln Heights Chamber of 
Commerce. He also organized a new Optimist Club in El Sereno and is one of the 
key fund-raisers for White Memorial Medical Center in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides time and labor, his charity takes the form of cold cash; Vargas 
estimates that he donates $70,000 a year to charities or charitable events. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's like Santa Claus," Allen said. "All he needs is a big white beard and to 
gain about 100 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Vargas -- a lanky man with slicked-back dark hair -- hardly resembles 
the man in the red suit, he sometimes can't help but play the role. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven days before Christmas, Vargas spent the morning in Downtown Los Angeles 
buying toys for dozens of children who would be coming to the Lincoln Heights 
Optimist Club party the following day. 
</P>
<P>
 "No guns, no guns," Vargas said as he browsed through the aisles of a store 
and finally reached for a Dream Girl doll. "Now, this is real nice. I'll take a 
half dozen." 
</P>
<P>
 By lunchtime, Vargas and fellow Optimist member Blackie Mata had picked out 
more than 50 dolls, games, race cars and other toys from various shops near 
Third and Wall streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Andy's a very good person," said Mata, who has known Vargas for 30 years and 
carries a photograph of one of his six grandchildren in her wallet. "Everybody 
in the community knows him and likes him." 
</P>
<P>
 The next day at the Christmas party, Vargas played host to 100 elementary 
school children crowded into the Los Angeles Boys' and Girls' Club in Lincoln 
Heights. While a magician and clown entertained the children, Vargas worked 
behind the scenes, passing out McDonald's hamburgers and 10-pound frozen 
turkeys to every child. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you think of someone who won the lottery, you think: 'That person would be 
doing this?' " said George Mauney, a longtime friend of Vargas. "Helping 
children is his life." 
</P>
<P>
 Three days before Christmas, Vargas stood outside the Bank of America in 
Lincoln Heights, handing out fruit and toys to children on the street. Every 
year, the Lincoln Heights Chamber of Commerce and local merchants sponsor a 
three-day gift-giving event. Vargas' responsibilities included going 
door-to-door to collect money from the merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boy, that wasn't easy," Vargas said as he watched hundreds of children line 
up for their free stocking along North Broadway. "Sometimes, you have to go 
back four or five times to the same store." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the hard work, Vargas seems happiest when he is in the midst of a 
charity event. He never complains of fatigue, although he spends most mornings 
and afternoons working on some philanthropic project. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never slows down," said Stella George, a fellow philanthropist and friend. 
"He makes plans like he's going to help children forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Vargas tried to help others long before he won the lottery, he did 
not have the influence or the financial means to make a difference, his friends 
say. Since winning, however, he has learned how to use his fame and instant 
wealth to become a more effective leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Petrified of speaking in front of crowds, Vargas enrolled in a Toastmasters 
speaking club and is "dangerous now when you give him the mike," said Richard 
Enriquez, former president of the Lincoln Heights Optimist Club and lieutenant 
governor of the southeast region of Optimist International. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas, who almost exclusively wore old slacks and golf shirts in the past, 
now wears suits when he attends formal functions and business meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's more polished and experienced than he used to be," Enriquez said. "But 
his personality hasn't really changed. Winning the lottery simply has allowed 
him to take his charitable gestures to a higher level." 
</P>
<P>
 More often than not, Vargas is described as an "average Joe," which sometimes 
hinders him when he takes on leadership roles. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's still learning," Enriquez said. "When he's in charge of the Optimist 
Club meetings, he sometimes jumps around from item to item on the agenda. It's 
more fun now, but less business. He has to learn how to be more of a 
bureaucrat." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Colorado, Vargas moved to California when he was 16, first to San 
Francisco and then to the Los Angeles area. After serving 19 months in the 
Navy, he worked as a dishwasher, a grass cutter and a welder at Pacific Pump, 
now known as Ingersoll-Dresser Pump Company in Huntington Park. 
</P>
<P>
 With $300 in the bank, he then began selling clothes out of his home, and in 
1963 opened a small business in Lincoln Heights that manufactured girls' 
uniforms. After winning the lottery, Vargas gave the business to one of his 
sons. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas, who struggled to send his youngest son to UC Berkeley, said he wants 
to help others pay for college because he knows how hard it is to succeed 
without an advanced degree. Although Vargas' wife and children support him in 
his philanthropic efforts, they say they prefer to keep their privacy and stay 
out of news stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I was at Pacific Pump, I was president of the union and wanted a job in 
management," Vargas said. "But because of my lack of education, I couldn't do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his wealth, Vargas has retained a simple lifestyle. He still lives in 
the same three-bedroom house he and his family moved into 33 years ago. And he 
kept his Ford Escort station wagon for more than two years after winning the 
lottery, eventually trading it in for a gold Acura Legend. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that's different is that now I can help more people," Vargas 
said. "Someone once said to me: 'You're a nut. You could be having a good time 
now.' And I said: 'I am having a good time.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Because Vargas rarely broadcasts the fact that he is a lottery winner, many of 
his friends didn't find out about his good fortune until years later. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know he was a millionaire until someone told me about two to three 
years later," said Jesus Rodriguez, a fellow Optimist Club member who has known 
Vargas for seven years. "He was giving to all these charities, and I asked 
someone: 'What's up with Andy? Is he a millionaire or something?' That's when I 
found out." 
</P>
<P>
 Other people still have trouble believing Vargas is a millionaire, especially 
when they see him digging through the trash for aluminum cans. 
</P>
<P>
 "One guy I know saw me on the street picking up cans, and he told this other 
guy: 'No way. That can't be the same guy who won the lottery. I saw him picking 
up cans,' " Vargas said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Vargas still collects cans because "it's a habit that's hard to 
stop," his biggest fund-raising effort is his annual golf tournament at the 
Montebello Municipal Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, the first year of the tournament, 68 players competed. Last year, 137 
golfers paid the $100 registration fee to take part in the charity event. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest supporter of Vargas' golf tournament is Riordan, who has sent 
players from his law firm to the tournament since its inception. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas met Riordan in 1988 at a banquet where they both were honored for their 
support of Los Angeles schools. Vargas later called Riordan at his law practice 
to invite him to play in his golf tournament, not knowing who he was or what he 
did. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was a schoolteacher or something," Vargas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moved by Vargas' down-to-earth personality, Riordan agreed and sent 13 players 
to the first Andy Vargas golf tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's an incredible role model," Riordan said. "I mean, here's a man 
who won the lottery and is giving it to education. His sincerity and generosity 
is almost to a point of compulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt very moved by what he was doing and wanted to help." 
</P>
<P>
 Loyalty works both ways, and during last year's mayoral campaign, Vargas 
proved to be one of Riordan's biggest supporters. He spoke at several campaign 
fund-raisers in Riordan's behalf, including one at the Biltmore Hotel in front 
of 500 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Vargas said he enjoyed being thrust into the middle of the campaign, 
his goal isn't to gain more publicity. Rather, his dream is to expand his 
foundation so that Glen Alta graduates can receive scholarships throughout 
their college career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I had a zillion dollars to help people with," Vargas said. "That would 
make me happy."

 A historic McDonald's restaurant in Downey survived the threat of closure last 
year, but a city official says the landmark still faces an uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
 Downey Councilwoman Joyce L. Lawrence said operators of the fast-food chain 
have negotiated a month-to-month lease with the owner of the property at 
Lakewood Boulevard and Florence Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald's representatives were not available for comment, but in the past 
they have said they want to close the restaurant because it is not making 
enough money. The restaurant's lease was to have expired Dec. 31, Lawrence 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans and historic preservationists want the '50s-era restaurant to remain open 
because it is one of the last to retain the chain's original red-and-white 
tiled design, golden arches and Speedee mascot. PSYCHE PASCUAL

NEW PHONE SYSTEM RINGS IN THE NEW YEAR AT CITY HALL; COMMUNICATION: FIASCO WITH 
13-YEAR-OLD HOOKUP BEGAN THANKSGIVING WEEKEND. SIX WEEKS AND $70,000 LATER, 
EMPLOYEES ARE BACK IN TOUCH. 
</P>

<P>
 Bells are ringing again at City Hall. The phone fiasco of 1993 is history. 
</P>
<P>
 After a six-week, $70,000 overhaul of the City Hall phone system, Building and 
Safety Director Chon Cervantes will inform council members Tuesday that city 
employees are back in full communication with the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's 13-year-old telephone system went down Thanksgiving weekend, 
leaving both the public and city workers frustrated. A leak in the basement 
reached the phone cable system and caused a short, leaving much of City Hall 
incommunicado, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Department phones were working within 24 hours. But for weeks, outside 
callers who dialed other departments would hear a mysterious clicking and get 
no answer, while others would be cut off before reaching their party or hear a 
recording informing them that their call did not go through. If a call did slip 
into City Hall, it usually could not be transferred. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, city employees could not make phone calls at all unless they were 
dialing 911. They even resorted to a pre-Alexander Graham Bell system of 
communicating by messenger within the building. Parks and Recreation workers 
were lucky -- they were able to use the pay phone outside their building. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was driving us all crazy," said City Manager Todd W. Argow. "We are a 
customer service organization and to have contact cut off with our customers 
and even each other caused us an extensive amount of frustration. There are 
some things beyond your control, even when you exercise due diligence." 
</P>
<P>
 Building and Safety employees worked around the clock to restore service, 
Cervantes said, and temporarily jury-rigged modem lines to be used for 
telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 7, the council scheduled a special meeting to approve spending capital 
improvement funds from the Public Works Department budget for the new system. 
</P>
<P>
 Telephone problems have not been unusual at City Hall, Cervantes said. The 
system frequently broke down, leaving the city switchboard eerily silent for 
hours. Plans for the new system were made in September, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The new system includes rented phone lines from Pacific Bell, voice-mail 
installation and eventual replacement of every phone at City Hall, Cervantes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the new system, city phone numbers have changed. The new main 
number for City Hall is (213) 563-9500; the Police Department can be reached at 
(213) 563-5400.

CLEANUP BEGINS IN PASADENA GLEN BASIN; ENVIRONMENT: COUNTY DROPS OPPOSITION AND 
BEGINS EFFORT TO KEEP DEBRIS FROM BEING WASHED DOWN ONTO COMMUNITY BY HEAVY 
RAINS. BUT OFFICIALS SAY IT IS A ONETIME ARRANGEMENT. 
</P>

<P>
 After 14 years of rejecting homeowners' demands to clean out the debris basin 
above the rustic canyon community of Pasadena Glen, Los Angeles County 
officials have changed their minds, saying they feel obligated to help protect 
the homes left standing in the wake of October's firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, county workers began cleaning out the basin, which was filled to 
the brim with rocks, tree trunks and other debris that had accumulated since 
1980. 
</P>
<P>
 In the event of heavy rains, mud and debris might overflow the basin and swamp 
the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (county) supervisors OKd (the cleanup) in the morning and our crews were 
out there by the afternoon," said Donna Guyovich, county public works 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 The county paid $129,676 to hire the crews, and the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency paid an additional $389,629 for the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have been battling the county in court for years over who is 
responsible for flood control in the unincorporated area above Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 The feud began 24 years ago after debris poured into the canyon. Pasadena Glen 
residents agreed in 1969 that if the county built a debris basin and made other 
flood control improvements, they would clean out and maintain the basin. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, the Pasadena Glen Improvement Assn., a homeowners group filed a 
lawsuit, charging that the county was responsible for flood control. They 
charged that residents' earlier agreement to clean out the basin was an unfair 
burden on them. Four years later, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge said the 
1969 agreement was unenforceable but stopped short of saying who was 
responsible for flood control. 
</P>
<P>
 After the October fire consumed 27 of Pasadena Glen's 62 homes and increased 
the chances of mudslides in the coming storm season, both sides say they have 
put aside their differences. 
</P>
<P>
 "This disaster brought us together," said Steve Schindler, vice president of 
the improvement association. 
</P>
<P>
 Although county officials agree, they insist that the cleanup is a one-time 
arrangement, and they do not concede they have responsibility for flood control 
in Pasadena Glen. 
</P>
<P>
 Better relations between residents and the county have helped ease homeowners' 
fears that they may not be allowed to rebuild. A county task force has asked 
community leaders for their views on how to allow rebuilding to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena Glen homeowners believe federal officials played a role in the 
county's change of heart on the debris basin. In November, Pasadena Glen 
residents were among fire victims who met with President Clinton at Pasadena 
Presbyterian Church. They told Clinton about their fight to get the county to 
clean up the debris basin, and he promised to help them.

 "The county was getting pressure from FEMA to sponsor the cleanout," said 
Linda Williams, president of the improvement association, who has participated 
in the county task force meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Guyovich disagrees. "Because debris knowingly could threaten structures, the 
county decided to do the work," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Schindler, 53, a Caltech astrophysicist, said that although last week's 
agreement is not a long-term solution to the dispute over flood control, at 
least the remaining homes will be protected this winter.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Over the years residents have laid thousands of sandbags to prevent flooding. 
John McPhee, in his 1989 book "The Control of Nature," described the 
neighborhood as one "that would rather defy nature than live without it."  
</P>
<P>
 Schindler and other homeowners who lost their homes in the wildfire that began 
Oct. 27 vow to keep defying nature. 
</P>
<P>
 The county task force's preliminary plans suggest that all the homes could be 
rebuilt on raised foundations, he said. Although the county has placed a 
moratorium on building while the task force studies Pasadena Glen, Schindler 
expects to pick up his building permit in March after the task force presents 
its report to supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Guyovich, the county spokeswoman, said no decision has been made on how many 
houses can be rebuilt or whether they may be as large as before. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force is still working with the county Fire Department to create a 
turnaround for firetrucks, which may prevent one or two houses from being 
rebuilt. The canyon has just one narrow main road that winds back and forth 
across the stream.

NEW FIRE CHIEF DISCUSSES VISION FOR DEPARTMENT; PROFILE: NOW AT HELM OF CITY'S 
FIREFIGHTERS, HAROLD OMEL IS ADJUSTING TO BEING OFF THE FRONT LINES, WHERE HE 
HAS HAD A PASSION FOR THE ACTION FOR 30 YEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The city's new fire chief is taken aback when asked if he intends to trade his 
firefighter's uniform for the standard attire of a top administrator -- a suit 
and tie. 
</P>
<P>
 For 30 years Harold Omel Jr. has been wearing the Long Beach Fire Department's 
blue and white, building a reputation as the consummate firefighter. 
</P>
<P>
 His popularity with colleagues and city officials swelled to such proportions 
that, in 1985, Fire Station 1 in downtown Long Beach was named for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I took so much flak from the troops, I can see why they usually don't do 
that until you're dead," Omel said, laughing.  
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Ernie Kell once suggested Omel would make a good city councilman. But 
Omel demurred, preferring to live in fire stations around town in 56-hour 
shifts and serve as a union official. 
</P>
<P>
 He was president of the Long Beach Firefighters Assn. for two decades and 
secretary/treasurer of the 22,000-member California Professional Firefighters 
union. He surrendered both positions when he moved into management ranks as 
chief this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting the errant blaze has been Omel's passion, he admits, ever since he 
joined the department in 1964. With little prodding he remembers the big ones: 
his first two-alarm fire at the old Grant's Department Store. The 500 fire 
calls in three days during the 1992 riots. The 12-story wall of flames he faced 
last year in Malibu. As a firefighter, an engineer, a captain and a battalion 
chief, Omel never left the front. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in his new chief's office with a view of the harbor and downtown, 
Omel, 51, said he is still amazed that in his new post, he will be going home 
every night (he's married with two daughters and three grandchildren). Clearing 
his personal belongings out of a firehouse after he was elevated to chief on 
Jan. 1 was one of the hardest things he's done, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Omel discussed his career and new position in an interview with The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Did you always want to join the Fire Department?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Oh, yes. My father was here and I saw he enjoyed going to work every 
day. He would come home and tell us about the people he helped. He wanted me to 
be a dentist. I wanted to be a firefighter and started preparing myself in high 
school, taking practice exams and fire science classes as soon as I could. I 
was actually hired to the Long Beach Police Department first and worked as a 
patrolman in 1963. Then I was hired on to the Compton Fire Department, but I 
always wanted to work here, where I was raised. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Considering the fact that you followed your father into the department, was 
the recent controversy about nepotism in hiring practices here a surprise? 
(Seven of 21 recruits initially selected by then-Chief Chris A. Hunter for the 
city's most recent fire training academy were from families of current 
firefighters. In the ensuing controversy, five of the candidates were dropped 
from the list.)  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. I feel strongly that there's nothing wrong with following in your 
mother's or father's footsteps. It's prevalent throughout the United States, 
especially in the fire and police services. As fire chief, I'm going to hire 
the most qualified person. If we have candidates who are firefighter's sons or 
daughters and they are the top people on the entrance list, I'm going to hire 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How about those sons and daughters who are not top people? There was at 
least one case recently where a candidate, the son of a firefighter, did not 
rank high on the list and still he was accepted.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, like I said I'm going to hire the most qualified. Some of those kids, 
we grew up with them. They're a known quantity. We know their parents, we've 
seen them grow up and we know exactly what kind of people they are. Sometimes 
there is an advantage to that. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: There was a lot of talk last year, and still is, about services being cut 
due to the lingering recession. How has the budget affected the department?  
</P>
<P>
 A: In the last two years, we've experienced about $3 million in cuts. We've 
reduced the number of paramedic units. We've eliminated one ladder-truck 
company. We have eliminated some staff from our fire prevention bureau. We had 
100 paramedics, we've cut down to 72. We had 11 paramedic units, we now have 
eight. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What does that mean for a city that continues to grow? Is it in danger, or 
was the department previously overstaffed?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Neither. We've changed the way we deliver emergency medical services. We 
have a private ambulance service that now helps us transport and we've put 
paramedics on some of our engine companies. So, as far as service goes, we 
haven't cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about response time, has that changed?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Not really. It takes longer for a rescue unit to get to some areas. 
However, the engine company is still on scene with a paramedic and we have a 
three-minute response time anywhere in the city. So people are receiving 
medical care within three minutes. We have the fastest response time of any 
city in California and we're real proud of that. We also have one of the lowest 
fire-loss ratios in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are your priorities for the next couple of years?  
</P>
<P>
 A: With the budget we're faced with -- the city probably has a $26-million 
deficit going in -- I'm going to be extremely happy if we can provide the 
service we have now. I'm going to do everything I can as fire chief to maintain 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is the equipment Long Beach has sufficient?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Our equipment is fine. We do have some fire stations that need upgrading. 
The life expectancy of a fire station is normally 50 years and we have some 
that are 70 to 75 years old that need attention. But they're also classic fire 
stations and part of the history of this city. That makes them hard to tear 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you want to tear them down?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Not all of them. We can reinforce them, but sometimes that's difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are we approaching a time when capital improvements will be necessary?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. I think, down the road, we will have to relocate some stations and 
combine others and when we do that, we can upgrade. But I feel that will take a 
bond issue, which will have to go to a vote of the people. The city obviously 
doesn't have 20 million bucks to build new fire stations when they're facing a 
$26-million deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Most of your experience has been on the front lines and you seem to see 
yourself as coming from the point of view of the average firefighter.  
</P>
<P>
 A: That's right. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you feel that will color your management style?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't know if it will affect it. But I understand what those guys are 
doing out there and I think that adds another dimension to my management style. 
The goals of the union and the goals of the fire chief are not that different. 
As fire chief I want to make sure all fires are put out and all injured people 
are in the hospital when we go home in the morning. And we want to do that as 
economically as we can for the citizens. We want to make sure the troops have a 
decent pay and benefit package and that nobody gets hurt. As a union president, 
those were also my goals. How you get there is a little bit different, but I 
think I can handle that. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So you don't feel that you lack management experience?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No, I don't think so. I've worked with five fire chiefs and three city 
managers as union president and I worked with the (previous) chief on the 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you think the lives will change for the firefighters, now that 
you're in charge?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, the morale is probably as high as it's been in a long time. You can 
go to any fire station and ask. I've worked with these guys real closely for a 
long time and it's like one of their own becoming fire chief. They feel like 
they're all a part of this.

KOREAN SOAP OPERA WINS FANS ACROSS ETHNIC LINES; CULTURE: VIEWERS ARE WON OVER 
BY THE 'FRESH APPROACH' THAT RELIES MORE ON FAMILY ISSUES THAN THE AMERICAN 
FORMULA OF VIOLENCE AND SEX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 There are no explicit bedroom scenes, evil twins or ex-husbands back from the 
dead in this soap opera. Instead, the audience is transfixed by mothers-in-law 
tribulations and the trials of being a modern young woman in a traditional, 
male-dominated society. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to "Missing You," a Korean television daily drama that bears only a 
remote resemblance to American TV soaps. It airs weeknights with English 
subtitles on Korean Television Enterprises Channel 18. 
</P>
<P>
 The nighttime drama has little violence, racy language or passionate kissing. 
</P>
<P>
 But what "Missing You" does have is a surprising number of non-Korean viewers, 
who have stumbled across the show by accident or tuned in on the advice of 
Korean friends and gotten hooked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really like the fresh approach that gives you some sense of drama and 
romance without having overlying sex and violence. The main focus tends to be 
on relationships and on changes going on around the people and their society," 
said Pasadena attorney David Mans, who watches the show nightly with his 
Korean-born wife, Sunhee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find that the American soaps are much more obsessed with sex and violence 
and they treat it in a titillating fashion. The Korean drama deals with sex in 
a very straightforward manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Korean Television Enterprises airs the show with English subtitles so that 
young Korean Americans (many of whom speak limited Korean) can watch television 
along with their Korean-speaking parents and grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
 But the subtitles have also served a group other than the target audience 
since "Missing You" started airing last year. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Korean network broadcast the show without subtitles one night, the 
station was hit with dozens of calls the next morning from non-Koreans 
complaining that they had missed their favorite show. "A lot of 
English-speaking people like this program. They all called to complain -- 
Mexican people, Japanese, American, Chinese," said Seung Lee, a network 
official. 
</P>
<P>
 Phuong Nguyen Sovan, a Covina manicurist born in Vietnam, started watching 
"Missing You" when it came on after a Japanese movie. "I don't speak Korean. I 
just watch the subtitles, but I love it because the story is the same Oriental 
story as in my country. It's like the same as our family -- love, family, 
problems. Just like in Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
 For Penny Causley, it was the ability to discover another culture that got her 
hooked on the show after she started reading the subtitles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a way of really being able to step into another life and lifestyle. By 
watching the show I found I could almost experience what being Korean was 
like," said Causley, who moved from the San Gabriel Valley to South Carolina 
last year and has searched in vain for the show on her satellite cable system. 
</P>
<P>
 The story line of "Missing You" centers around a young couple starting their 
life together in downtown Seoul. Other Korean daily dramas -- which don't have 
subtitles and are not popular with non-Koreans -- concern historical drama, 
family dynasty and even farm life. The dramas typically run for six months to a 
year and then they conclude their story lines and are replaced by new shows. 
</P>
<P>
 For a Korean drama, "Missing You" is surprisingly modern in its treatment of 
the changing role of women in society. After all, heroine Sin-hee is a working 
woman with a strong individualistic streak who wants to continue her interior 
decorating career after her marriage. Her husband, Myong-jun, is willing to 
stand up to his dowry-grubbing mother to defend his beloved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most Korean males like their wife to belong to them," Lee said. "He has 
enough self-confidence in his own character to let his wife have her own 
identity. He does not want to be influenced by his family structure." 
</P>
<P>
 In Korean society, where feminist ideals are only slowly taking hold, this is 
tantamount to revolutionary. 
</P>
<P>
 "This Sin-hee is very smart and she sort of knows how to make things come 
about for herself. In the old times, I don't think they could get away with 
that," said Korean-born Carolyn Choe of Downey, who watches the show along with 
her parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger generation is fascinated by "Missing You" because it deals with 
modern challenges to the traditional Korean social structure. But many of their 
elders are not so accepting. 
</P>
<P>
 "For my parents, they can't accept the woman trying to control the man," Choe 
said. "I don't think they like that drama for that reason." 
</P>
<P>
 But David Ree, 17, of La Crescenta likes it precisely for that reason. 
"Sin-hee's very pretty and she's so smart. The guy, all his life all he's been 
doing is studying. He's really smart but he's such a nerd. I just hate him," 
said Ree, who has lived in La Crescenta since his family emigrated from Korea 
14 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Mans, Ree likes the Korean dramas better than their American 
counterparts. "It's nice and clean, innocent and lots of fun," he said. "It's 
even rare to see people kiss -- hold hands is really the farthest they do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Helen Choo, 18, of La Canada said the Korean culture and marriage traditions 
are especially interesting to her. "It's more modern than most of the dramas 
and I think it's more realistic. In Korean culture, traditionally, the man is 
the master and the woman is more dependent. But women are more independent 
these days." 
</P>
<P>
 "Missing You," like all Korean dramas broadcast in the United States, is 
produced in Seoul, Lee said. After each episode is broadcast in Seoul, the 
costly English subtitles are supplied by a Hawaiian television network. The 
show airs in the Los Angeles area about a week after it is first broadcast in 
Korea, said Kwan Kim, a producer at Korean Television Enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why he thinks the story of Sin-hee and Myong-jun has attracted such a 
following, Kim laughs. "It's a love story -- that's why people like it."

PIECES FROM THE PAST; MUSEUM OF HISTORICAL ODDS AND ENDS FACES UNCERTAIN FATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA GRIEGO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not far from the downtown of gleaming office buildings and chic restaurants -- 
the area where Long Beach leaders see the city's future -- a longtime resident 
has hoarded all he can from the city's past. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Larkey's Long Beach is still the place where the wooden Cyclone Racer 
roller coaster ruled the beach, where drugstores still had soda jerks, haircuts 
could be had for 15 cents. And where, he says pointedly, there really was a 
"long beach." 
</P>
<P>
 In a beat-up storefront near 3rd Street and Elm Avenue, Larkey, 65, re-created 
the city as it was in the first half of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 He dedicated a corner to the Navy, with a mannequin dressed in uniform, 
matchbooks from sailor haunts along Ocean Boulevard, and a model of the Mighty 
Mo battleship. He set up on old barbershop, a corner grocery store, an old 
hotel switchboard, a living room. Everything, from the Rinso and White King 
cleanser on the shelves of the grocery store to the wooden roller coaster car 
and the pews piled in back, was found in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the building that has housed Larkey's Long Beach Heritage Museum is 
threatened. City building inspectors recently declared the building 
substandard. After 80 years of sitting in the same place with a concrete slab 
as a foundation, the building has begun to lean to one side, the result perhaps 
of an inadequate foundation and "significant structural problems," city 
inspectors say. Owner Gordon Hudson said he has a choice: get a city 
rehabilitation loan and fix it up, or tear it down. He and Larkey, who helps 
manage the building, are counting on the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't get it, I'm not sure what I'll do," Larkey said. "I'm retired, I 
don't have enough money to move someplace else." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's action came as Larkey was preparing to refurbish and reopen his 
museum. Eight years ago, Larkey stashed the more valuable things in storage and 
moved to Oregon to run a hotel. He sold the hotel and returned home last year 
loaded with pillows and blankets, plates and silverware, and other odds and 
ends that he planned to sell to earn some money. They are piled all over the 
storefront, which now barely resembles the Heritage Museum Larkey was so proud 
of. 
</P>
<P>
 The place is a mess. Water leaking from the three apartments upstairs has 
stained the whit e ceiling like tobacco juice, and the plaster is peeling in 
places, revealing wood planks. 
</P>
<P>
 Larkey's pride and joy, the soda fountain from the old Harriman Jones medical 
clinic, dominates the room, but it is covered by an old tarp, and that is piled 
high with magazines, books and other stuff for sale. The barbershop has been 
dismantled. The Cyclone Racer car is all but invisible, stashed in a corner 
near a smiling mannequin dressed like a sailor. The church pews are jumbled in 
the back. (Larkey plans to sell all but one to raise money and create some 
space.) A 12-foot-tall surfboard of mahogany or redwood -- Larkey is not sure 
which -- stands in the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The only displays intact are the operator station from the old Del Mar Hotel 
and the Navy retrospective. The telephone operator station comes with an 
old-fashioned wood switchboard, a dozen or so heavy black phones, a few old 
phone books and phone bills, and black and white photos of operators at work. 
The Navy display has dozens of photos of sailors, small gray ship models, 
trinkets once sold at the Pike. 
</P>
<P>
 The condition of the place is enough to make any archivist shudder, and Larkey 
readily acknowledges that he is not much of a curator. The most valuable items 
are still in storage, but he has no idea how many items he has, nor how many 
old photos or Long Beach postcards he has collected over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 But he argues that the city, not Ken Larkey, not even the Long Beach 
Historical Society, should take charge and dedicate a museum to the city's 
history. Larkey, a member of the historical society, flushes and clasps his 
hands together, rolling one thumb over the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city fathers don't care about old Long Beach," he says bitterly. "They 
took downtown away from the people and gave it to the moneymakers. I've had 
young people come in here and they can't believe what Long Beach looked like. 
'What happened?' they ask. What can I tell them?" 
</P>
<P>
 Larkey said he fished the first piece of his collection, a 1906 panorama of 
the city, out of a garbage can when he was 9 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, he has never stopped collecting. He decided to open the first museum 
in 1971 after he displayed his sizable Long Beach photo collection at a hobby 
show and dozens of people gathered to see it. The museum, originally called 
Queen of the Beaches, stayed open intermittently during the next 14 years, 
depending on the number of patrons and how much spare change they dropped into 
the old metal bus fare box that he set up for collections. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Larkey haunted swap meets, scoured classified ads and 
sweet-talked demolition crews for much of his collection. He saved what he 
could from some of the city's oldest buildings -- the beloved Pacific Coast 
Club, the Jergins Trust Building, the First Christian Church, the Omar Hubbard 
apartment building -- before they became, respectively, a condominium tower, a 
dirt lot, a parking garage for the Long Beach Plaza mall, a city parking 
garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Larkey also published a series of calendars with black and white photos, and a 
picture book about the beach in which he criticizes city leaders for 
"destroying the very thing that attracted tourists and visitors to Long Beach." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked why he has devoted so much time to his collection, the normally 
talkative Larkey mumbles something about future generations and repeats the 
story of people asking what happened to old Long Beach. "I'm not good with 
words," he grumbles. "I wrote something about it in one of my calendars 
somewhere. Look it up." 
</P>
<P>
 It's there, in the back of the 1994 calendar, called "I remember. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our ties with the past cause us to reflect and make some choices about our 
own quality of life and the way we choose to direct and maintain it," Larkey 
wrote. "Our old trees, roads, and buildings are important because they are our 
touch with our past, our roots. Without them, we look like everyone else; we 
lose our point of reflection, we lose our tangible tie with our ancestors and 
all those who have gone before us."

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST : THE REGION; USE OF NEW CAR-POOL LANES UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than three weeks after ride-share lanes opened on the Foothill Freeway 
between Pasadena and Glendora, large numbers of commuters are using them to 
beat rush-hour traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're right on target for our projections," Caltrans spokesman Russell Snyder 
said.Caltrans engineers had set an initial target of 800 to 1,000 vehicles in 
each direction during peak hours based on a five-year goal of 1,500 vehicles 
each way. 
</P>
<P>
 Initial studies by Caltrans engineers indicate that 1,000 vehicles used the 
westbound lane in the morning's peak rush hour and 1,200 vehicles used the 
eastbound lane in the evening's peak rush hour, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Buses, motorcycles and automobiles with two or more people can use the lanes, 
open in both directions between Hill Street in Pasadena and Sunflower Avenue in 
Glendora. 
</P>
<P>
 Use of the car-pool lanes is expected to rise because traffic volume during 
the holidays is lighter than usual and many drivers were not aware the lanes 
were open in both directions, Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said use of car-pool lanes typically increases after two or three months as 
eligible drivers become familiar with them.

 All the majesty of the Mojave Desert can be found condensed into a single 
rock, through the Japanese art of suiseki , said enthusiast Don Kruger as he 
showed off a rock he found that closely resembles a desert landscape, complete 
with buttes and mesas. Suiseki (pronounced soo-ee-sehki) involves the 
collection of stones carved by wind and water to resemble miniature mountains, 
animals, flowers and figures. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's related to Zen and meditative transportation. The stone takes you there. 
When you look at a mountain stone, the stone takes you to the peaks, to where 
you can hear the birds and actually be there," said Kruger, 46, a location 
manager in the movie industry and a member of California Aiseki Kai, a local 
suiseki club. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 150 suiseki stones gathered by Aiseki Kai members are on display at 
the Huntington Library in San Marino this weekend at the organization's fourth 
annual suiseki show. Free to the public, the show also features a continuous 
narrated slide presentation explaining the art of suiseki. About 4,000 attended 
last year's show, Kruger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aiseki Kai meets every third Wednesday of every month at the Museum of Science 
and Industry at Exposition Park. Members go on field trips to areas near Death 
Valley and the Kern and Eel rivers twice a year to look for new stones, Kruger 
said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Suiseki, or "viewing stones," was first documented in China in the 8th 
Century. The Chinese propagated the art when emperors presented the miniature 
stone scenes as gifts to representatives from Japan, Korea and other Asian 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, the stones can command hundreds of dollars. Traditional Japanese 
homes display the stones on specially carved wooden bases (dai) or in sand- or 
water-filled trays (suiban). The stones are also displayed next to bonsai and 
ornate scrolls. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth annual exhibition of suiseki and viewing stones will continue at 
the Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens in San Marino 
between 10:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m. today. MIKE CARLSON

BEST BET: PHOTOS THAT RECALL CAMBODIA'S FATE

 Before the age of photography, society did not know what it was like to have 
an objective memory. The mind softens rough edges with time. Painters, creating 
oil portraits for those who could afford the vanity, could slim the jowls, 
remove unsightly spots and generally beautify the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Photographs won't do that. As this country discovered during World War II and 
again during the Vietnam War, photographs remember for us all the horrible 
reality of a time, a people. 
</P>
<P>
 That is not to say photographs won't lie. As we move into a time of 
computer-generated, retouched, manipulated images, we may find ourselves unable 
to believe what we see on the black-and-white or color page. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are some who still believe photographs should be used as a 
memory-scape, no matter the quality of the image. 
</P>
<P>
 Sithea San, director of the Arts of Apsara Gallery in the United Cambodian 
Community Plaza of Long Beach, is such a person. For her, the "Impressions of 
Cambodia" photography exhibit is about much more than images of her homeland 
hanging on the wall. The show is about remembering and telling the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit San put together probably will not draw art reviewers. It is 200 
photographs, both professional quality and amateur, mostly taken by members of 
the local Cambodian community during visits to their homeland. Most are in 
color. 
</P>
<P>
 A few older photographs, dated before the start of the civil war in the early 
1970s, also dot the exhibit. These were included, San said, to show people what 
the capital, Phnom Penh, looked like before war set in and nearly leveled the 
city. The exhibit includes pictures of the country's holiest temple, Angkor 
Wat, basking in a former glory that has been somewhat diminished by theft and 
erosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who recently returned to power in the self-appointed 
role of his country's savior, also makes an appearance in the photographs. And 
for those who might have forgotten Sihanouk's role in bringing the bloody Khmer 
Rouge to power, there are photos of the prince posing with Khmer Rouge 
warriors. He is smiling and wearing their clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to show this so everyone will remember what happened to Cambodia," San 
said. "So they will know what can happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 "Impressions of Cambodia" runs through Feb. 24 at the Arts of Apsara Gallery, 
2338 E. Anaheim St., Long Beach. Admission is free and the gallery is open from 
1 to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Friday. Information: (310) 433-2490. EMILY ADAMS

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST : SAN GABRIEL; MISSION PROJECT TO BEGIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Groundbreaking for the first phase of beautifying the district around the San 
Gabriel Mission is slated for Wednesday, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the City Council accepted a bid of $1.879 million from Gentry 
Brothers of Irwindale to make the improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 "For many people, this is going to be a dream come true," said Councilwoman 
Mary Cammarano. Plans to create a setting worthy of the mission have been 
discussed in various forms for at least 25 years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trees, street lamps and decorative paving in keeping with the mission and the 
Civic Auditorium will be installed, mostly along portions of Mission Drive. 
Some sidewalks will be widened to attract more foot traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The work should be completed in July, said City Administrator P. Michael 
Paules. 
</P>
<P>
 The city hopes the changes will attract new businesses, especially ones that 
cater to shoppers, tourists and diners. 
</P>
<P>
 To finance the project, the council voted to supplement the $1.55 million 
already budgeted with $350,000 from a gasoline reserve collected by the state.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST : BALDWIN PARK; COUNCIL VACANCY FILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a 2-to-1 vote, the Baldwin Park City Council on Wednesday appointed public 
relations specialist and Chamber of Commerce President Teri Muse to fill a 
vacant council seat until April's election. 
</P>
<P>
 The seat was vacated by Bobbie Izell, who resigned Dec. 31, City Clerk Linda 
L. Gair said.Izell, who had missed 24 council meetings in 1993 because of his 
travel schedule, resigned because he is moving to Arkansas, Gair said. 
</P>
<P>
 Declaring that the city deserves full representation by a five-person council, 
Mayor Pro Tem Martin Gallegos nominated Muse, a spokeswoman for Kaiser 
Permanente, which is building a hospital and medical center in Baldwin Park. 
Muse has also served as a city human services commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 The nomination was seconded by Councilman Raul Martinez. Councilwoman Julia S. 
McNeill praised Muse but said the seat should remain vacant until the April 
election and that filling the post for three months would give Muse an unfair 
advantage over other candidates. Mayor Fidel A. Vargas was absent for the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Muse took out nomination papers Dec. 21 declaring an interest in running for 
election to a council seat, Gair said. On the April ballot, the mayor's seat, a 
two-year term, will be open along with two four-year council seats, the ones 
filled by Muse and McNeill. So far, five people have declared an interest in 
running for mayor and 10 people have declared an interest in the two council 
seats, Gair said.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST : COVINA; VOLUNTEER PATROL FORMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Covina officials are forming a volunteer citizens patrol to free more police 
officers to fight crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteer program, approved by the City Council last week, is expected to 
begin in about a month.Volunteers will write handicap-parking citations, 
impound abandoned vehicles, assist officers with traffic control, take police 
vehicles for repairs and perform other routine duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Within six months, officials say, about 50 volunteers will be put to work. 
Eventually, some will serve as extra "eyes and ears" for police, patrolling the 
community, looking for crime and alerting officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The $4,000 start-up cost of the program includes uniforms, badges, hand-held 
two-way radios and background checks for all volunteers. Citizens who pass the 
background checks will receive training and be assigned four- or five-hour 
shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members want the volunteer patrol to include citizens of all ages. In 
neighboring La Verne, West Covina and Claremont, such volunteer patrols have 
been designed primarily for senior citizens.

RURAL SCHOOL BECOMES DESERT DORM, KEEPS CITY YOUTHS OUT OF TROUBLE; OREGON: 
TOWN GIVES STUDENTS A TASTE OF SIMPLE LIFE, OLD-FASHIONED DISCIPLINE, A CHANCE 
TO TURN LIVES AROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID FOSTER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jaime McLawhorn, 18, needed a change of scene. Her grades were in the gutter 
and her friends were drifting toward drugs, alcohol and trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 When she heard about a public boarding school in this central Oregon town, she 
thought she might find support here for starting over, far from the temptations 
of her old school in a Portland suburb. 
</P>
<P>
 First, however, she had to find Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 200-mile drive into the lonely sagebrush hills of Oregon's high 
desert, Jaime and her mother went straight through town without realizing it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like a little ghost town," Jaime recalled. "I said, 'Where are the 
hangouts? Where's the pizza parlor? Where's the 7-Eleven?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, population 185, has none of those things. Mitchell doesn't have much 
of anything -- and that's precisely the point of an unusual experiment in 
public education taking place here. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell has turned its public high school into a boarding school, taking in 
students from afar and giving them a taste of rural life, some old-fashioned 
discipline, and a chance to stay out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't much to do in Mitchell, and we try to make studying a priority," 
said Michael Carroll, school superintendent. (He's also principal, athletic 
director, Spanish teacher and substitute bus driver.) 
</P>
<P>
 Students like Jaime, who pay only a $75 monthly dormitory fee, see Mitchell's 
boarding school as a cheap alternative to private school. Townspeople see it as 
a way to save their high school from closing for lack of students. 
</P>
<P>
 County population has been shrinking for years. When Carroll arrived in 1975, 
Mitchell had 40 students in grades 9-12. Now there are 29, not counting dorm 
students, and in four years there may be only 15. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not enough to support a high school, Carroll said. Many students 
already endure long bus rides in from ranches; if Mitchell's high school 
closed, they would have to attend other schools at least 45 minutes away. 
</P>
<P>
 The boarding school prevents that. For every student enrolled, Mitchell School 
District gets $4,500 from the state. By adding dorm students to keep enrollment 
steady, the high school can pay its four teachers and maintain its programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The dorm -- three single-width trailers stuck together near the football field 
-- opened in September, 1992. Its 14 beds, half for girls, half for boys, have 
been filled since last February. It has a waiting list of 25. 
</P>
<P>
 For some new students, the culture shock is severe. 
</P>
<P>
 From the school's hillside perch, a potholed road passes 50 or so houses 
before dropping down to Mitchell's business district: two stores, a gas 
station, three cafes and a post office. 
</P>
<P>
 That's about it. Outside town, cattle and sheep roam the valleys; logging 
roads climb into the forested hills. Mitchell is a place where they play 
country western music at school dances, a place where kids can walk the streets 
at night, provided they watch out for deer bounding by. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also a place where people are expected to pull their own weight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids learn to get lost in the big schools," said Dennis Dalton, math and 
science teacher. "There's no way to get lost here. Everybody is noticed." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell is not running a reform school -- a record of violence is the one 
automatic disqualification for applicants -- but discipline is stricter than at 
most public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 If a boy and girl are caught kissing in the hall, they may have to stand three 
feet apart the rest of the day. If a student says "shut up" in Misener's class, 
he or she will be writing "shut up" 1,000 times. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorm students must do 30 minutes of homework each night before lights go out 
at 10:15 p.m. For every D, an extra half-hour of homework is required; for 
every F, one hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell is not for everyone. Half of last year's dorm residents did not 
return in the fall. And seven have been kicked out since the program began, 
four for drinking, one for smoking, one for sneaking off with her boyfriend for 
a weekend, and one for smuggling in a marijuana bong. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they don't want to be here, then we don't want them," Carroll said. "We're 
set up for the kid who wants to come here, wants to do well, and wants to get 
along." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who stay seem to thrive, despite bouts of homesickness. Nearly all have 
improved their grades, and most participate in school activities and sports. In 
Mitchell, everyone makes the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Jo Ann Reynolds, 18, arrived last year after drifting in and out of classes in 
Astoria, on the Oregon coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Her absences there weren't noticed, she said. "Nobody even cared. I didn't do 
my work, I got deeper in a hole, and I couldn't get out." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, her Ds have turned into Bs. She is student council secretary, and she's 
taking extra classes so she can graduate next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Heather Sullivan, 14, came last fall. Mitchell saved her from a Portland high 
school where, she said, "there are drugs all over the place, and if you narc on 
somebody, you're dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Her tough shell -- "I wasn't going to let anybody get close to me" -- soon 
dissolved in the dormitory's cramped quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The dorm is like any household with a teen-ager, times 14. There are shrieks 
when the phone rings, arguments over the shower, laughter and shouting and kids 
running by constantly. 
</P>
<P>
 Boys are on one side, girls on the other, separated by a dining area and TV 
room, where they park themselves on Montezuma's Revenge, a green velvet couch 
as ugly as it is comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorm life revolves around Margaret McDaniel, 44, a divorced mother hired to 
live there. The kids call her Mom, and she's always home when they get out of 
school, baking cookies, brokering arguments, bugging them to do their homework. 
For some students, she provides a sense of security they never got at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's boarding school is not unique. Crane Union High in eastern Oregon's 
sprawling Harney County runs a dorm for its own students who want to avoid long 
daily bus rides from scattered ranches. And the Upstate New York town of 
Newcomb, its enrollment also falling, plans to turn its school into a boarding 
school with a focus on environmental studies.

SUSPECTS ARRESTED AFTER FREEWAY CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 16-year-old rammed a car, which he allegedly stole, into two La Verne police 
patrol cars and led officers on a 100-m.p.h. chase on the San Bernardino 
Freeway (10) before his arrest in Baldwin Park after crashing into a parked 
car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The chase began Wednesday about 9:40 p.m. after an officer checking out a 
report of an attempted break-in on a pickup truck spotted the suspects' Camaro 
about half a mile away, La Verne police Lt. Paul Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers from La Verne, West Covina, Baldwin Park and the California Highway 
Patrol followed the car at speeds exceeding 100 m.p.h. until it left the 
freeway and hit a parked car in Baldwin Park, Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, a 16-year-old from Pomona, was arrested along with his two 
15-year-old passengers, also from Pomona. All will be charged with possession 
of stolen property, Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver will also be charged with vehicle theft, felony evading, and 
assault with a deadly weapon, Allen said.

ORGANIZERS OF CABLE TV CALL-IN SHOW HOPE TO MAKE MATH A HOUSEHOLD SUBJECT; 
EDUCATION: LOCAL TEACHERS AND STUDENTS WOULD BE FEATURED IN THE TWICE-WEEKLY, 
HALF-HOUR PROGRAM TO BE CALLED 'CLASSROOM CONNECTIONS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Lights! Camera! Answers! 
</P>
<P>
 If a group of local teachers achieves its goal, within a few months some 
educators will be video stars and students will get math tips via the tube. 
</P>
<P>
 "Classroom Connections," still in the planning stages, would feature local 
instructors and students teaching math lessons in a twice-weekly, half-hour 
cable show on Liberty Cable's SGTV, Community Channel 3, project coordinators 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program would be a hometown version of "Homework Hotline" sponsored by the 
Los Angeles Unified School District on KLCS-TV Channel 58 and now in its ninth 
season. The teacher and host of "Homework Hotline" answers students' math and 
language homework questions on the air. A bank of teachers answers additional 
telephone questions off-camera. 
</P>
<P>
 "Classroom Connections" will target elementary and middle-school students and 
will be underwritten by the South Gate cable station and possibly local 
businesses, said Nanette Cooper, a teacher at San Miguel Elementary School and 
one of the program's organizers. The show's on-air teacher will deliver a 
prepared lesson to a small group of students and use hands-on tools that help 
make math concepts concrete. The teacher will answer questions from the pupils 
in the studio and from callers. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the program will handle a different math theme each month. Later, 
organizers hope to expand the program to cover English as a Second Language and 
other subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who may be reluctant to tune in to the district's homework show will 
be lured to the South Gate program by the hope of seeing their teacher or 
friends on television, said Linda Williams, a member of the program committee 
who teaches fifth and sixth grades at San Miguel. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and other teachers should benefit from the show, too, Cooper said. 
Parents who may be embarrassed to admit they don't understand their children's 
schoolwork can learn along with the student. Teachers may tape the show and use 
it as a classroom tool. 
</P>
<P>
 The program format is still in development, a host must be cast and about 25 
teachers are being sought to handle telephone lines, said Janet Fujii, a 
committee member and South Gate Middle School math resource teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 To supplement the program, the committee hopes to sponsor monthly math 
workshops in which students can create math study tools such as those used on 
the show, Fujii said. 
</P>
<P>
 San Miguel student Israel Sandoval Jr., 11, who is a math fan, said he is 
looking forward to watching the show. "It will help me learn more and do better 
in class," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As with any production, financing is a stumbling block. The committee hopes to 
pay teachers $16 per hour to work on the show. Start-up costs, including lights 
and other equipment, could be nearly $20,000, said Robert Mellonig, Liberty 
Cable's director of programming. The budget for teachers' salaries and a staff 
for two or three cameras could reach $1,000 a month, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberty Cable officials have agreed that the station will fund equipment and 
salaries for the show, but company president Michael Green said details need to 
be finalized. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our project, and we're going to fund everything and support it in 
whatever way is possible, but I want (the program) to be substantive," Green 
said. "Everybody's positive about it, but it has to be done right. To be less 
than that would be a disservice." 
</P>
<P>
 Program coordinators also plan to seek grant money and recruit businesses to 
sponsor the show. An open house is scheduled for later this month to introduce 
the project to school administrators, city officials and business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Elisa Hernandez, 35, mother of San Miguel students Joshua, 8, and Pablo, 12, 
said she is excited about "Classroom Connections."  
</P>
<P>
 "If I know what time this is on I would have them sit and watch it or I could 
make tapes and watch it with them later," she said.

POLICE SAY MAN STOLE BAITED MONEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A $2,000-stack of $20 bills loaded with bait dye and tear gas exploded in an 
Arcadia bank employee's shoe Wednesday night as he tried to walk out the door 
with the money, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shant Albert Salim, a new accounts clerk who had worked for five months at the 
Bank of America on 169 E. Foothill Blvd., was making a last check of the teller 
drawers around 6:15 p.m. when he discovered the stack of bills, Arcadia police 
Capt. Dave Hinig said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 19-year-old Temple City resident stashed the money in his shoe, Hinig 
said. But when Salim attempted to leave the bank, sensors in the doors caused 
the bait pack to explode and envelop him in a cloud of tear gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Salim was taken to Methodist Hospital and treated for minor burns on his foot 
before being booked at Arcadia City Jail on suspicion of attempted grand theft 
by embezzlement, Hinig said. He was being held in lieu of $10,000 bond.

AT 100, THIS PENSIONER STILL REMEMBERS -- AND ENJOYS -- THE GOOD LIFE; PROFILE: 
PETER BENTOVOJA VIVIDLY RECALLS THE BIRTH OF THE LONGSHOREMEN'S UNION IN 1933. 
AND HE'S STILL REAPING THE BENEFITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Peter Bentovoja received the biggest pay raise of his life -- $200 a month -- 
three days before his 100th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Pedro centenarian's "pay raise" was actually an increase in his 
longshoremen's union pension that took effect New Year's Day. The increase 
alone, he says, is more than what he was earning when he retired 35 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "First thing you should buy a new chair for yourself. Your chair looks 
terrible," Maria, Bentovoja's wife of 67 years, suggested as the two sat in the 
living room of their home. 
</P>
<P>
 "And while you're at it," added Maria Bentovoja, 91, "you should buy me a new 
rocker." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was quite a week for Bentovoja, who was the recipient of the raise and the 
guest of honor at a birthday party Wednesday from the International 
Longshoremen's and Warehousemen's Union. He is the oldest of the union's 10,000 
pensioners. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 retirees attended Bentovoja's party at the Wilmington 
headquarters of Local 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentovoja was a charter member of the union in 1933 when it was organized by 
Harry Bridges, a friend, and one of Bentovoja's two heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two men I admire the most in my life were Harry Bridges and President 
Franklin D. Roosevelt," Bentovoja told party-goers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thanks to Bridges, members of the ILWU are among the highest paid workers in 
America today. When FDR came into office, he told workers to organize for a 
better life. That's what we longshoremen on the waterfront did. Led by Harry 
Bridges, we formed a union and never regretted it. It gave us security, a good 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is still giving me a good income. My union pension is now $970 a month. It 
was $80 a month when I retired 35 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Lou Loveridge, president of the local's retiree organization, said Bentovoja 
was "one of the staunchest believers whenever Harry Bridges called a strike for 
higher wages, better benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 For the longshoremen, who handle cargo on the waterfront, the path to 
financial well-being was often dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tough in the early days," Bentovoja recalled. "We fought hard to make 
headway. The strikes were mean. Six longshoremen were killed up and down the 
Pacific Coast -- two in San Pedro during the first ILWU strike (in 1934). We 
were out three months. But it paid off in the long run." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the union was formed, Bentovoja said, he was fortunate to earn $25 a 
week. "Now the guys are making almost that much an hour," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Today, most of the goods are packed in containers and moved around with the 
help of machinery. In Bentovoja's time, longshoremen hauled the goods. 
</P>
<P>
 But such labor came easily to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Born on the Croatian island of Korcula on the Dalmatian Coast, Bentovoja was a 
shoemaker from the time he was 12 ("I made shoes from scratch, selling them 
house-to-house") until he left for the United States seven years later. 
</P>
<P>
 When he arrived in America in 1913, he worked as a laborer for the Southern 
Pacific Railroad in Sacramento for four years and went on to become a streetcar 
motorman in San Francisco for four years until moving to San Pedro in 1921. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a commercial fisherman on Mexican and Canadian boats before finally 
becoming a longshoreman in 1926, the year he married Maria, who was also born 
on Korcula. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bentovojas have lived in the same house since it was constructed in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
 "I paid $500 for the lot and $4,000 for the house -- a lot of money then," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 They raised two sons: Pete, a retired Los Angeles Times artist, and Bob, who 
was an artist for the Los Angeles Examiner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, Bentovoja is at a loss to explain how he has lived so long. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what I would like to know," he replied when asked for his secret. 
"I've never really been sick. My mind is clear. I can remember everything from 
when I was a small boy all through my life. I don't need a cane to walk or 
anything like that. I have all my teeth. I don't wear glasses except to read. 
I've been very lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 "Until three years ago, I walked a couple miles every day to downtown San 
Pedro to stand on a corner and visit with my old cronies," he explained, "but 
they're all dead now, and those old cronies were guys younger than me. For 
years I played pinochle every day but that ended a long time ago when all the 
other card players died. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I go visit my friends now, I have to go to the cemetery." 
</P>
<P>
 Now he spends his days cooking alongside his wife and gardening. 
</P>
<P>
 And he keeps a positive outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 "I live for today, for a little wine and a good dinner every night," he mused. 
"For me, everyday is a wonderful day. And, why not? I'm still here."

'STREET SOLDIERS' USE TALK RADIO TO REACH OUT TO GANG MEMBERS; SAN FRANCISCO: 
CALLERS GAIN ACCESS TO OMEGA BOYS CLUB WORKSHOPS THAT PROVIDE ACADEMIC HELP, 
JOB TRAINING, PEER COUNSELING FOR IMPRISONED YOUTH AND VIOLENCE PREVENTION FOR 
GANG-WAR REFUGEES.

<P>
 It's 10:33 on a Monday night when KMEL disc jockey Kevin Nash trades his love 
ballads and Top-40 hits for a grittier mix. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to kick off 'Street Soldiers' tonight," Nash says as he lowers the 
volume on the mellow jazz blowing in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to save some lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next four hours, Nash and hosts Joe Marshall and Margaret Norris take 
calls from: 
</P>
<P>
 * A young man who raps about rebuilding a life blown apart by his mother's 
murder, his father's shooting and his own involvement with gangs and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 * A woman who talks for 15 minutes about other people's pain before letting on 
that she and her children are living in a homeless shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 * A group of rappers organizing a "peace party, dance and talk show" to end a 
small-town turf war. 
</P>
<P>
 * A jail guard torn by her concern for the women she sees behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, Marshall and Norris, both of them teachers, mete out advice, 
encouragement and stern warnings -- the kind of talk that might come from 
responsible parents, sadly lacking in many of their listeners' lives. 
</P>
<P>
 It is all part of a community-based effort to end the street violence that 
plagues, above all, minority youth. 
</P>
<P>
 KMEL is the city's most popular music station; in fact, the first host of 
"Street Soldiers" in 1991 was the rapper Hammer, and the name was taken from 
one of his songs. But "Street Soldiers" offers no music -- just the harsh 
realities of the inner city. And the effect is often gut-wrenching. 
</P>
<P>
 A 16-year-old boy is deaf to his older brother's warnings about gangs; he says 
he needs his crew for protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't need a gang," Marshall says. "Gangs only exist to hurt other 
people. . . . You're playing with fire, I'm telling you. Get out." 
</P>
<P>
 "At the beginning of your call, you said it's getting crazy out here," Norris 
says. "Well, who's responsible for the madness? You are." 
</P>
<P>
 Another call: A former gang-banger fights his urge to strike back at a 
tormentor who is "disrespecting" him. 
</P>
<P>
 "So the talk takes away your manhood?" Norris says. "Back up a second. Did you 
really understand that question that I asked you? I said, does the talk take 
away your manhood. And you said, 'Yes'?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe you don't have the right definition of manhood," Marshall says. 
</P>
<P>
 But "Street Soldiers" offers more than words. 
</P>
<P>
 Callers also gain access to an extended family network centered around the 
Omega Boys Club of San Francisco, co-founded in 1987 by Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
 Omega workshops provide academic help for college-bound students, job training 
for high-schoolers, peer counseling for imprisoned youth and 
violence-prevention training for gang war refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall, 46, is Omega's executive director. Norris, 41, is the club's 
academic director. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're like the father and mother of Omega. They're both nice, but they have 
that stern outlook. . . . They'll never let you go down," says Otis Mims. 
</P>
<P>
 Mims, a star high school athlete whose addiction to crack cocaine cost him a 
college scholarship and nearly ruined his life, was coming out of a four-year 
tailspin when he tuned into "Street Soldiers" last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a light going off in me," he says. "Things just weren't right in 
my life and I knew it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mims received counseling, academic help and tuition money from Omega. Now 23, 
he attends Contra Costa Community College, one of 110 young men and women in 
college on Omega scholarships. 
</P>
<P>
 Corey Monroe, 22, discovered Omega five years ago. His mother died when he was 
14, his father had a drinking problem. Now he's a ready-for-work counselor at 
the Potrero Hill Neighborhood House, a youth center. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's temptation out there. You get teased a lot, being young, if you're 
not in a crowd," Monroe says. "Being a teen-ager, you always want to fit in. 
You want to be like everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Hunters Point neighborhood where Monroe grew up, being like everyone 
else can mean skipping school, joining a gang, packing guns or doing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know a few that have been killed; I know a few that are in jail now. I know 
a few that started smoking drugs," Monroe says. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of the kids I hung out with and none of the kids in the projects are 
bad. It's just that parents aren't there for them. They don't have role 
models." 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall and Norris say optimism is a key to their success. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've just got a tremendous faith in people. And the kids, we've got an 
enormous faith in them," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But they also acknowledge the obvious: There are a lot of people who have sunk 
beyond their reach. In October, a stray bullet fired by one such person killed 
San Francisco community activist Maxine Hall, a woman dedicated to helping 
youths like the one who shot her. 
</P>
<P>
 On the radio show, Norris urges witnesses to come forward and identify Hall's 
killer for police. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who killed Mrs. Maxine Hall? All of us who know and remain silent are 
guilty," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 The hosts never lose sight of the fact that their listeners are constantly 
confronted with difficult choices. "It's hard," says the youth who was 
struggling to refrain from striking back at trash-talkers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure it's hard, man," Marshall replies. "Life is hard."

HOT PROPERTY: HEIDI NAMES HER PRICE: $1.8M 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Reputed Hollywood madam HEIDI FLEISS' Beverly Hills-area home has been listed 
for sale at just under $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss, 27, was indicted last fall by a grand jury on pandering and narcotics 
charges. She is accused of operating a call-girl ring catering to prominent 
Hollywood figures. 
</P>
<P>
 The home, listed for $1,795,000, is a one-story villa with three bedrooms and 
maid's quarters in about 3,500 square feet, and is said to have "generous 
entertainment areas with unobstructed views from downtown to the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
 Built in the 1950s, the house has been owned since July, 1992, by Fleiss' 
father, Dr. Paul Fleiss, a Los Feliz pediatrician. The house formerly belonged 
to actor Michael Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
 Heidi's father also owned her previous home in West Hollywood, which just sold 
for close to its asking price of $299,000, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurt Rappaport of Myra Nourmand & Associates in Beverly Hills has the listing 
on the Beverly Hills-area home, other sources said. Rappaport was also involved 
in the doctor's purchase of the Beverly Hills-area home and sale of the West 
Hollywood house. JANE SEYMOUR, star of the CBS series "Dr. Quinn, Medicine 
Woman," and her ex-husband, David Flynn, have sold their 3.5-acre Montecito 
estate to singer/songwriter Jeff Lynne, one of the founders of the Electric 
Light Orchestra, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The house sold for about $2.9 million, sources say. It was listed at $6.2 
million in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Seymour, who has remarried since divorcing Flynn, is living in Malibu now. 
Flynn, a business manager involved in real estate businesses, lives in Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 The Montecito home, which Seymour and Flynn owned for several years, was built 
in the early 1920s but was later remodeled. It has a four-bedroom, 
5,000-square-foot main house and three guest cottages, a tennis court, two 
creeks, rolling lawns and a motorcourt. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Lamborn and Bonnie Jo Danely, both of Pitts & Bachman in Montecito, 
co-listed the residence, Flynn said, and Stephanie Taliaferro of Jon Douglas 
Co., Montecito, represented the buyer, a divorced woman with two teen-agers. A 
Pacific Palisades home reportedly built in 1928 for opera star AMELITA 
GALLI-CURCI has been sold for close to its last asking price of just under $2 
million, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-level, 32-room home was on the market about three years ago at $12 
million. The 9,000-square-foot house, taken back by the lender through 
foreclosure, has terraced gardens and an aviary. 
</P>
<P>
 Galli-Curci, who died in 1963, had a home during her later years in Westwood, 
which is now owned by actor Carroll O'Connor. That home was designed by the 
late architect Wallace Neff. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palisades home, owned by American Savings Bank, was listed by Adam 
Blumenstein of Jon Douglas Co.'s Santa Monica office. Dennis Frusciano of Fred 
Sands' Pacific Palisades office represented the buyer, described as a local 
businessman. A La Habra Heights home with a sod roof, a glass-bottom bathtub 
situated over a koi pond and an interior waterfall is on the market at $850,000 
or $1.2 million, depending on whether the buyer wants three or five acres. Two 
of the acres are bare land. 
</P>
<P>
 Loret Sayler, who owns the home with her husband, Jack, designed the nearly 
4,000-square-foot house, which was built 17 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "She used a sod roof to integrate the house with its natural setting," said 
listing agent Pam Kennedy of Coldwell Banker Roberts Real Estate in Whitter. 
</P>
<P>
 The waterfall was built inside the house because the Saylers like the sound of 
rain. The sod roof is planted with red apple, a succulent that is drought- and 
fire-resistant. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saylers listed their home, with city and valley views, because they plan 
to move to Northern California now that their children are in college. 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra Heights, an incorporated city 25 miles southeast of downtown Los 
Angeles, has been home to several sports celebrities including Texas Rangers 
pitcher Rick Honeycutt. Screenwriter JOHN M. WILSON, who recently completed his 
40th script for Fox TV's "Code 3," has purchased his first home, a two-bedroom 
house in West Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who also wrote "The Complete Guide to Magazine Article Writing," paid 
about $300,000 for the residence, built in 1931, sources say. Kim Schneider of 
Coldwell Banker, Hancock Park, was the selling agent. An 11,000-square-foot 
home on 15 acres has come on the market at La Selva Beach, just south of 
Monterey, at $4.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "I call it 'the Malibu of the north' because the area is becoming known for 
its oceanfront estates," said Caroline Cocciardi, who spent four years building 
the house with her husband, Jack Eitzen. The house has 6-foot-high, 
bronze-inlaid front doors, which weigh half a ton each, and 70 marble columns, 
which flank the home's perimeter. 
</P>
<P>
 After they were married in 1985, the owners toured Europe. "Now we want to 
sell the house and go back to Italy to study the architecture some more," she 
said. Vince Brown of ERA in Soquel, near Capitola, Calif. has the listing.

BEHOLD THE ROSE; NOW'S THE BEST TIME TO PLANT AMERICA'S BEST-LOVED BUSH: 
'BARE-ROOT' ROSES WILL BURST WITH COLOR IN THREE MONTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SMAUS, TIMES GARDEN EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why would anyone plant a rose bush that looks like something you might see on 
trash day, sitting on top of a garbage can? 
</P>
<P>
 Because they're a bargain and, with a little care, these lifeless-looking 
plants will be bursting with blooms in less than four months. 
</P>
<P>
 For the uninitiated, they're called "bare-root" roses, and they're a lot less 
expensive than roses sold later during the year in nursery containers. At one 
nursery, roses that cost $17 in a container in spring or summer, cost $7 right 
now if they are older, non-patented varieties. Patented roses, including this 
year's newest (such as the spooky, dark red Taboo), cost from $10 to $15. 
</P>
<P>
 Discount chains sell them for even less, but usually have a lower grade of 
smaller plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only are they dirt cheap, they are abundant at this time of the year. One 
Westside nursery has over 350 varieties and one in Orange County stocks over 
3,000 bushes. It's such an occasion that gardeners call this, the middle of 
winter, the bare-root season. 
</P>
<P>
 Many experts also think that this is the best way to plant a rose, because 
bare-root roses, after being dug from the growing field, make their new roots 
in your soil and not in the cushy soil of a nursery container. They quickly 
become established in your garden, growing bigger and stronger as a result. 
Some nurseries sell the naked plants out of bins or boxes filled with damp 
sawdust, a good idea because you can see the roots so you know what you are 
buying. 
</P>
<P>
 Most, however, sell bare-root roses in tightly wrapped plastic bags. You can't 
see how many roots the rose has (sometimes lots are lost in the digging process 
at the growers), but you are assured that they haven't dried out. If roots get 
too dry, the rose is as good as dead. 
</P>
<P>
 If you unwrap a bare-root rose at home and find the roots dry and brittle, or 
there are too few, most nurseries will take the plants back and give you 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still other nurseries take bare-root roses and put them into small, temporary 
nursery containers. If you plant these before mid-February, you can simply 
shake off the potting mix and plant them bare root. If you can't plant right 
away, the rose is not going to suffer, snug in its temporary can. 
</P>
<P>
 Bare-root roses from bins or bags should be planted as soon as possible. To 
make sure the roots are not dry, soak them overnight in a pail of water before 
planting. (Don't leave them longer than overnight or the roots will suffocate.) 
</P>
<P>
 Unwrap the plants and cut any restraining ties used in shipping. 
</P>
<P>
 Dig a shallow but wide hole for each rose. Floribundas and the smaller shrubs 
and English (or Austin) roses need a hole about two-feet wide. Space plants 
about the same distance apart. Hybrid teas and large shrub or English roses 
need 2 1/2-foot-wide holes and should be spaced three feet apart. Make the 
holes about 18 inches deep. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't work in a wet soil or you'll turn it into something similar to concrete. 
Wait three to four days after a rain for it to dry out a little. 
</P>
<P>
 A wheelbarrow is helpful at this point. Put the soil from each hole into it, 
or into a pile, and mix in organic soil amendment until the dirt, when squeezed 
in your fist, will not make a hard ball. Give it a firm push and it should 
crumble apart. 
</P>
<P>
 You may need as much as a 1 1/2-cubic-foot bag for each hole, but probably 
half that. 
</P>
<P>
 Some gardeners also like to mix in fertilizer at this time. Use a slow-release 
form of fertilizer or an organic form, so the fertilizer doesn't go to work too 
quickly. Follow label directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes the fun part of bare-root planting. Remember dirt pies? Take some of 
the amended soil, put it back into the hole and pat it into a tall pyramid or 
cone shape in the bottom of the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Evenly spread the bare roots over this cone of soil, and then fill the hole 
with more of the amended soil. Gently push it between the roots and firm it 
with your hands. 
</P>
<P>
 When the hole is finally full, push the soil down with your foot, gently 
compacting it, so the soil doesn't drain or dry out too fast after watering. 
</P>
<P>
 How deep do you plant the rose? There is a little debate on this subject, but 
most people plant so that the "bud union" (that enlarged area where most of the 
stems grow from) is just above ground. 
</P>
<P>
 If you plan to put on a thick mulch, keep the bud union about two inches above 
ground. A stick laying across the hole helps you judge the proper level. 
</P>
<P>
 Planting a little high lets you quickly identify any growth (called "suckers") 
that sprout from the plant's roots. These you want to snap (not cut) off 
because they are coming from the rootstock and are a different, usually 
uninteresting, kind of rose, certainly not what you remember planting. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There will be soil left over, so mound it up to make a doughnut-shaped 
watering basin around the edge of the hole. This will help funnel rain and 
irrigation water directly to the roots. Give the roses one thorough soaking, 
filling each basin at least two times. 
</P>
<P>
 Some gardeners like to pile a mound of pure amendment over the newly planted 
and watered rose. You can also use the wood chips that the rose was packaged 
in. Mix them in with the amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 These gardeners leave the mound in place until the rose begins to leaf out, 
usually in a week or so, the idea being that the organic matter protects the 
canes from the sun and from drying Santa Ana winds. 
</P>
<P>
 When it's time to remove the mound, simply wash it away with a gentle stream 
of water and it becomes mulch, something roses definitely like. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't give the roses any additional fertilizer for a month after planting, but 
water them if we get no rain. Be careful not to overdo it, though. At this time 
of the year the soil dries slowly and roses don't need much water. 
</P>
<P>
 New growth will sprout quickly. If you buy a rose that already has sprouts 
longer than an inch or so, snap or cut them off, plant, and the rose will make 
more. You can leave the sprouts, but they will probably die because there are 
not enough roots as yet to support this growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Expect your first glorious blossoms during the first weeks of April, 
remembering what a bargain they were. How to plant a packaged bare root rose 
</P>
<P>
 1. Make a hole and mix amendment with the dirt you dig out. Make a cone of 
this amended soil on the bottom of the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Remove the rose from it's package and spread the roots over the cone. A 
board helps determine the height of the bud union. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Cover the roots with more amended soil, firming with your hands and 
finally, when the hole is filled, with your feet. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Make a watering basin around the hole with the soil that is left over. Fill 
it several times with water. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Mound the wood chip packing and more amendment over the rose. When growth 
starts, wash this material away. SELECTING BARE-ROOT ROSES 
</P>
<P>
 If sprouting growth is already three inches or longer, break it off with a 
down-ward push. New growth will sprout from buds on either side. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut off any stubs, as close to base as possible. Rose experts use a narrow 
key-hole saw, seal cuts with white glue. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope for lots of roots, especially smaller ones. These plants grow quicker, 
bloom better. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for three or more healthy, green canes, the thicker the better (indicates 
older bushes). 
</P>
<P>
 Plant rose bushes so the bulging "bud union" is just above ground, or even 
higher if you plan to mulch.

APARTMENT LIFE: CAN LANDLORD DEDUCT FOR SMOKE DAMAGE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN POSTEMA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: In your Dec. 19, 1993, column you answered a question headlined "Two 
Security Charges for Two Apartments?" I have a similar situation with a 
townhouse in San Diego that I rent out. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, the renter who has lived there for the past two years gave me notice 
of his intention to move. On a repair visit shortly thereafter, I found out 
that the tenant is a chain smoker. I was unable to remain in the unit for any 
extended period of time due to the appalling stench. 
</P>
<P>
 While I was there, I noticed that the expensive drapes that were hung 
throughout the townhouse had extreme smoke penetration and discoloration due to 
exposure to cigarette smoke. The carpets are a mess too. 
</P>
<P>
 According to your previous article, the owner of that apartment building could 
only charge his two-year renter one-third of the cost of carpet and drape 
cleaning because the judges say that three years is "normal wear and tear" for 
carpets, drapes and paint. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the tenant of my townhouse has lived there for less than three years, 
can I charge him the full cost of cleaning the carpets and drapes? Are the 
rules the same for townhouses as for apartments? Are they the same in San Diego 
County as in Los Angeles County? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Generally, the rules for rented townhouses are the same as the rules 
for rented apartments, but judges' interpretations of the law can vary from 
county to county, just as they do from judge to judge. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Robert Winter Jr., an associate counsel with the San Diego law 
firm of Kimball, Tirey & St. John, which specializes in landlord/tenant law, 
most judges in San Diego County define normal wear and tear differently than 
most Los Angeles County judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Winter said most judges there tend to interpret normal wear and tear as five 
years for carpets, drapes and painting, instead of three years. 
</P>
<P>
 That would mean that you could reasonably charge your tenant, who has lived in 
the townhouse for two years, 60% of those costs. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if the smoke damage is bad a judge may very well find a 100% 
deduction appropriate for the cleaning. If I were you, I'd deduct the 100% and 
let the judge decide if that's fair, if it comes to that. Finding Apartment 
When Time Is Short 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I am a single, professional woman who lives in West Los Angeles. I want to 
move from my longtime two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, which rents for $800 a 
month, to a similar apartment with a better location north of Wilshire 
Boulevard in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 I know this is not usually easy, but with the number of for-rent signs around 
I thought it might be possible. I don't have a lot of time to walk around and 
knock on doors. What is the best way to get an apartment there, given my 
constraints? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Apartments in Santa Monica are usually hard to find. The recession, 
however, has created more vacancies there than usual, making it a little easier 
to find one. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than knocking on doors to find an apartment, you can try some of the 
local realtors who personally represent Santa Monica owners or keep lists of 
vacancies there. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Robert J. Sullivan, a Santa Monica realtor and property manager 
(Sullivan-Dituri Realtors), methods and compensation for finding you an 
apartment vary. Some will sell you lists while others will not charge you 
anything unless they find you a suitable apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan said, "Know in advance what the charges will be and who pays them, 
you or the apartment owner." 
</P>
<P>
 While many of these realtors have traditionally advertised in the newspapers, 
the recession has affected them too. So the yellow pages are also a good place 
to let your fingers do the walking for a realtor who specializes in property 
management. Living Room Flooding Must Be Remedied 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I have rented a West Hollywood apartment for the last eight years. Since I 
moved in, the living room has substantially flooded at least once during every 
rainy season. 
</P>
<P>
 Each time the furniture must be replaced and the carpet taken up to dry. 
Sometimes, this takes weeks to accomplish. 
</P>
<P>
 Although numerous attempts have been made to repair the roof, none have been 
successful. It appears to me that there is some kind of structural defect or 
damage causing the leaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Does the law require only that good-faith efforts be made to fix the problem, 
or must it be rectified? Also, does the fact that I have put up with the 
problem for so long reduce my rights to now demand an effective correction of 
the problem? 
</P>
<P>
 A: While into each of our lives a little rain may fall, the state habitability 
code says that's not true of apartments. It requires that residences have roofs 
that don't leak. There are local remedies for such problems in the city of West 
Hollywood for rent-controlled apartments too. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Clarke Ireland, a rent stabilization counselor with the city of 
West Hollywood, you may request from the West Hollywood Department of Rent 
Stabilization a rent reduction for the apartment via a rent decrease 
application. They may be reached by phone at (310) 854-7450. 
</P>
<P>
 Ireland said that after your complaint is filed an inspection will be 
conducted and a hearing will be scheduled, which you must attend. The 
department will require the owner to fix the roof and it will reduce your rent 
until he does. 
</P>
<P>
 If your apartment is not rent-controlled, you can call the planning division 
of the city of West Hollywood at (310) 854-7475. It will inspect the property 
and cite the owner to fix the roof under the state habitability code.

 When Rebecca and Jose Molinar came to La Puente looking for a home they had 
several requirements: four bedrooms, a nice, quiet neighborhood and no swimming 
pool. "Too expensive to maintain," Rebecca Molinar said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to move to this area to be closer to my husband's work," she said. 
"He is a self-employed truck driver working primarily for a company in the City 
of Industry. We found the prices in Whittier were too high and began looking in 
La Puente. Our friends warned us that there was a lot of gang activity in this 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before we made the offer on the house we wanted, I came (to the neighborhood) 
at different times of the day and night . . . looking for graffiti, parties and 
basically if the streets were quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The area we bought in was a quiet, well-maintained location. Everybody on the 
block is a homeowner and they care about their property." 
</P>
<P>
 The 2,200-square-foot home they purchased in February, 1992, for $175,000 has 
four bedrooms, two baths and a big back yard -- with a swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the realtor suggested I look at the house I didn't want to do it because 
of the pool," Rebecca Molinar said. "But it's not as costly to maintain (as I 
thought), although it is time-consuming." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the family hopes to move to a larger home in the future, but she 
wants to stay in La Puente. An important reason is that they're pleased with 
the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Erica, their oldest child, attends Bassett High School. Two children attend 
Don Julian Elementary School and the youngest is a preschooler. "The children 
would not want to move away," Rebecca Molinar said. 
</P>
<P>
 La Puente covers 3.5 square miles and has a population of about 38,055 -- 74% 
Latino. It is 18 miles east of downtown Los Angeles and just north of the 
Pomona Freeway in the San Gabriel Valley. The City of Industry is on the south 
and west border. Los Angeles County is on the east and the unincorporated 
community of Valinda runs along the northeast. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is named for Rancho La Puente, a vast spread that 150 years ago 
covered 48,000 acres between the Whittier hills and the present-day San 
Bernardino Freeway. Mexican Gov. Pio Pico granted the rancho in 1841 to two San 
Gabriel Valley pioneers, John Rowland and William Workman, who raised cattle 
until the great drought of 1864 ruined that enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 But the valley soil was rich, and farming and sheep raising flourished. 
European immigrants, including significant numbers of Spanish and French Basque 
farmers, were attracted to the region. 
</P>
<P>
 The Basque families herded their sheep from place to place, unhampered by 
fences, and farmers such as the three Patritti brothers worked hard to secure a 
good life for their families by hauling sheep and horse manure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of a trucking business," said Jolene Patritti, who still lives in 
La Puente and who, with her brother, Lon, runs the family business. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father, Matt Patritti, who was born here in the early 1900s, later became 
a home builder," she said. "They built single-family homes in subdivisions when 
the town started to grow. Later, they constructed apartment complexes." 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, the family operates a property management company that Matt Patritti 
established. "We work out of the same old office in downtown La Puente," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mona Wilk is another longtime resident. "We moved here in 1937, and it was all 
open country," she said. "After World War II it was said this was the 
fastest-growing area in the whole United States." She said that at one point it 
was called "Kidville" because there were so many children. 
</P>
<P>
 She and her husband, Lawrence, built their first home in 1939 on a one-acre 
lot that they bought for $1,800 and had two children of their own. By 1962, the 
family had moved down the block into a home for which they paid $14,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilk, now retired, worked as a realtor for many years and saw property values 
increase. "When I started in 1964, homes were selling for $7,000 up to 
$16,000," she said. "Then suddenly they were selling for $25,000 and $30,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, you can't buy a home in La Puente at those prices today, but 
compared to other areas in Los Angeles County, La Puente does offer some good 
opportunities for homeownership. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Ramos, an agent with C-21 Metro in La Puente, said the average price in 
the city is about $155,000 for a three-bedroom, two-bath home in about 1,400 
square feet. For $200,000, a buyer would be looking at 1,800 to 2,400 square 
feet and four bedrooms with 2 1/2 or 3 baths. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the homes on the hill close to the Industry Hills golf course will 
have a view," Ramos said. "There's a 2,900-square-foot home listed for 
$289,500. It has four bedrooms, 2 1/2 baths. It's a two-story home and has a 
swimming pool, and air conditioning." 
</P>
<P>
 Another listing, at $140,900, is for a three-bedroom, 1,445-square-foot home. 
"It's perfect for a family looking for a nice place to live," Ramos said. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the goal of Maria Altamirano, her sister, Marcella Aguilar, and their 
mother, Erma Aguilar. The three women, who have family in La Puente, had lived 
in Los Angeles, but they wanted to be closer to their work. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria is a psychiatric technician at Metro State Hospital in Norwalk, Marcella 
works in social services for Orange County and Erma is retired and plans to go 
back to school. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of Spanish people in La Puente. Mom speaks Spanish and she 
has friends and relatives here who speak her language," Maria Altamirano said. 
</P>
<P>
 The home they bought in 1993 for $145,000 has four bedrooms and two baths in 
1,400 square feet. One of the important considerations for the three women was 
to be close to a church and a parochial school. Maria has a daughter, Coreena, 
who is on the waiting list for either St. Joseph or St. Louis of France 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 They live close enough that when an opening comes up, Coreena will be able to 
walk to school. In the meantime, the 7-year-old is attending a parochial school 
in Baldwin Park. Maria's 2-year-old son, David, will also be able to attend one 
of the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we started looking for a house we considered Ontario or Chino, but that 
was too much of a commute and too much traffic," Altamirano said. She said 
prices in some other areas were just too high. 
</P>
<P>
 In La Puente they found a nice house with a big yard at the right price and 
the opportunity to live in a community with a strong ethnic flavor and with 
schooling opportunities the family wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Public school students are served by one high school, two elementary schools 
and an adult education program, part of the Bassett Unified School District. 
Supt. Linda Gonzales said La Puente has excellent schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not in denial that we have gangs," she said. "But we have not had any 
incidents of gang violence, and we have outreach programs. This is a community 
of people who depend on others in the community. This is a family-oriented 
town, and we have a strong outreach with the local churches." 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Don Larson of the Los Angeles County sheriff's station in the City of 
Industry said the problems of gang activity are addressed with a three-pronged 
effort -- that of the schools, the city and law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 There is some graffiti vandalism and occasional acts of violence, Larson said, 
"but the city is very aggressive in dealing with that problem. Cleanup is part 
of that program and is (done) in concert with the school districts and law 
enforcement." At a Glance

YOUR MORTGAGE; PROPOSED APPRAISAL COST SLASH HAS FLAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. HARNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's top banking industry regulators want to slash the 
cost of thousands of home appraisals performed around the country, potentially 
saving you money on your next purchase or refinancing. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound good to you as a consumer? After all, why pay $300, $400 or more for an 
appraisal if federal banking regulators can help you pay less? 
</P>
<P>
 There's just one catch: The regulators' cost-cutting plans don't necessarily 
extend to you. They're solely for banks and thrift institutions, who need not 
pass on a cent of the actual net savings when you go to settlement on your 
mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more important, by allowing banks to use in-house or other personnel who 
are not state-licensed or certified as appraisers, the market valuation of the 
house you plan to finance could be affected -- up or down. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, an uncertified, inexperienced appraisal employee of a bank could 
undervalue the property you expect to purchase, thereby lowering the maximum 
loan amount the house could support, and perhaps blowing the whole deal. 
</P>
<P>
 That could be the case particularly in market areas that take special skills 
to appraise, like neighborhoods that haven't had much sales activity recently, 
or markets where values have been soft but are now turning around. The same 
goes for central city neighborhoods or rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's going on here? What are the regulators planning to do? Here's a 
quick overview: 
</P>
<P>
 Changes to federal appraisal standards for state banks, national banks and 
consumer savings banks are part of a deregulation package being pushed by the 
Clinton Administration. The four major financial institution overseers -- the 
Comptroller of the Currency, the Federal Reserve Board, the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp. and the Office of Thrift Supervision -- now all agree: 
</P>
<P>
 Appraisals on properties with loans under $250,000 do not require professional 
valuations by licensed or certified appraisers. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because licensed appraisers tend to charge more, and they take more 
time doing their valuations than banks and thrifts making home mortgages really 
need. Moreover, regulators say that studies by their own auditors show that 
loans on properties under $250,000 haven't been the main source of the banking 
and thrift industries' well-publicized financial woes. Loans to developers of 
condo projects or commercial properties have been far bigger culprits. 
</P>
<P>
 The regulators also argue that raising the threshold for certified appraisals 
from $100,000 -- its current statutory level nationwide -- to $250,000 would 
have no impact whatsoever on the "safety and soundness" of any bank. 
</P>
<P>
 To the contrary, they say, appraisal deregulation would streamline the whole 
mortgage lending process and cut total costs. A $250,000 threshold would mean 
that 82% of all existing homes and 85% of newly built homes financed by banks 
and thrifts no longer would require valuations by licensed appraisers. 
</P>
<P>
 All loans originated for sale to the big secondary market agencies -- Fannie 
Mae and Freddie Mac -- would still be subject to the $100,000 rule, however, 
because both firms insist upon it to maintain underwriting quality. But large 
numbers of new loans would not. 
</P>
<P>
 How would that affect you if you applied for a mortgage at a bank or thrift 
covered by the revised standard, which could take effect in 1994? Would you get 
the same quality appraisal on your home and pay less? 
</P>
<P>
 One of the proposal's advocates, Roger H. Pugh, the Federal Reserve's 
assistant director for bank supervision and regulation, is emphatic that you 
will. By using in-house personnel to "evaluate" your property, "you're going to 
save time and do the job at a lower cost." 
</P>
<P>
 But Pugh conceded in an interview that nothing in the proposed regulatory 
change would encourage or require a bank to pass along the reduced cost to 
borrowers. The effective cost of an in-house valuation of a property could be 
relatively small -- $150 or less -- but the settlement sheet could still bill 
you for the going local rate, such as $350 or $400. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope that (banks) would share the benefits (of the relaxed appraisal 
standards) with the consumer," he said. "But there is no requirement that they 
do so." 
</P>
<P>
 That, in turn, say critics of the rule change, could open home mortgage 
borrowers to an unseen double-whammy: They would be charged the same amount as 
they'd pay for a licensed appraisal, but in reality receive a valuation by an 
individual who had not passed the minimum educational and experience tests for 
certification required of appraisers in all 50 states. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Richard C. Sorenson, the incoming president of the Appraisal 
Institute, a national professional group, more than 80,000 appraisers across 
the country have qualified for certification or licensing under state 
standards. And, argues Sorenson, the number of certified appraisers has been 
growing steadily, putting downward pressure on prices in some markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Competition among trained professionals -- not cutting the quality of the 
product -- is the smarter way to go on appraisals, in Sorenson's view.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here are suggestions from the California Assn. of Nurserymen on what to do in 
the garden this week:  
</P>
<P>
 * For a new year, plan on a new garden.Replace overgrown shrubs and plant new 
ones in their place. The same applies to trees. Add color to the flower beds 
and be sure to plant some flowering shrubs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be sure to bait for snails and slugs when you plant winter bedding plants. 
</P>
<P>
 * January is the time to plant summer blooming bulbs -- watsonia, cannas and 
more.

APPLIANCE CHECK BY GAS CO. COULD PREVENT TRAGEDY 
</P>

<P>
 It is a tragedy that occurs every year in Southern California. We see it on 
the evening news . . . a family is asphyxiated in their sleep from poisonous 
fumes emitted by a faulty gas furnace. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, almost every such tragedy we hear about is preventable by simply 
contacting the Southern California Gas Co. to arrange a free safety check of 
your gas appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is not widely publicized, the Gas Co. suggests that homeowners and 
renters call their number, listed in the local white pages, to have a 
technician come for an inspection at least once a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The service person will check for proper venting, gas leakage, burner 
operation and firebox cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Any problems he or she detects will likely not be solvable on the spot as the 
Gas Co. does not do repair work. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead they may issue a "notice of unsatisfactory condition," which requires 
you to have a licensed contractor make repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, if this occurs you may be inconvenienced by not having use of the 
appliance until repairs are completed, but you may be preventing a tragedy at 
the same time.

SPRAYING AWAY GARDEN PESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Winter spraying is what is know as preventive medicine for the garden. The 
enemy is usually hidden or just fast asleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Who are these enemies? They are some of the worst pests such as mites, scale, 
some species of aphids, rose mildew and especially the fungus that causes peach 
leaf curl, which can only be controlled by spraying. 
</P>
<P>
 The keystone to success is thorough spraying with the correct product. 
Anything less means a wasted program. Spray from the bottom up, including the 
undersides of limbs. Avoid spraying during the heat of the day as this will 
help decrease the evaporation of the spray and don't spray on windy days to 
avoid and minimize drift. 
</P>
<P>
 Always mix the solution as recommended by the manufacturer.

BEHIND THE CHIAPAS REVOLT: CORN GODS, DUMMY RIFLES; MEXICO: TO THE MAYAN 
MILITANTS, NAFTA WILL PERMANENTLY SEVER THEM FROM THEIR ORIGINS. THEY WOULD BE 
LESS-THAN-HUMAN MEN OF WOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Victor Perera, Victor Perera, who teaches journalism at UC Berkeley, is 
author of Unfinished Conquest: The Guatemalan Tragedy and Last Lords of 
Palenque: The Lacandon Mayas of Southern Mexico, with Robert D. Bruce (both UC 
Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The wooden rifles borne by some of the Tzeltal Maya militants of the Zapatista 
Army of National Liberation are more than crude simulacra of AK-47 or Galil 
automatic weap ons fashioned by desperate Indians unable to obtain the real 
thing. The dummy rifles are poignant symbols of the indigenous peasants' 
500-year-old history of defeat and humiliation by the West; they are also 
cultural artifacts that connect the insurgents to their origins. 
</P>
<P>
 Embedded in the "Popol Vuh" or Quiche Maya Book of Council is an ancient 
creation story, variations of which are found in all the Maya linguistic 
groups. As recounted in the Quiche version of the "Popol Vuh" translated in the 
16th Century, the gods made three attempts to create mortals beings capable of 
pronouncing their names and venerating them in the manner to which they wished 
to become accustomed. 
</P>
<P>
 The first experiment was earthen creatures, who were deaf and dumb and 
incapable of movement. The mud creatures fell apart and dissolved in water. 
</P>
<P>
 The second experiment was wooden creatures, who outwardly resembled the men 
and women of today. They were agile hunters capable of reproducing themselves, 
building their own homes and fashioning their utensils, but they were 
bloodless, and had no souls. They possessed the faculty of speech, but their 
praise of the gods was hollow, and they did not know how to keep their 
calendar. This defect so angered the gods that they brought down a great flood 
on their creatures, and caused their own animals and utensils to turn against 
them, until they were crushed. The survivors climbed the trees of the forest, 
becoming monkeys. 
</P>
<P>
 The gods deliberated long and hard before deciding on their third experiment 
-- to mold men and women of corn. The maize plant was sacred to the gods; so 
the creatures whose blood and sinews they fashioned from the husk and kernels 
of white and yellow corn partook of their divinity. The men of maize had such 
far vision that the envious gods dimmed their eyes "as the face of a mirror is 
breathed upon." These men and women were the ancestors of the Mayas, who 
flourished and created one of the great civilizations on the American 
continent. 
</P>
<P>
 The campesino of Chiapas reduced to carving and bearing a dummy wooden rifle 
broadcasts not only his desperation but his profound sense of humiliation. Five 
hundred years of Western dominance threaten to extinguish his divine spark and 
reduce him to a creature of the second creation, a less-than-human man of wood. 
</P>
<P>
 Tzeltal Mayas who left their hillside and jungle homes to join the insurgency 
told interviewers of their fear that NAFTA, an acronym whose meaning they only 
dimly understood, would lead to the loss of their last link to their Mayan 
ancestors: their milpa , or corn field. In their small parcels of inherited or 
purloined soil, the Mayas of Chiapas and Guatemala -- to which Chiapas belonged 
until a century ago -- plant their corn and beans. In this manner they 
preserve, however tenuously, their ancient covenant with Heart of Heaven, who 
created them in the image of their ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
 The North American Free Trade Agreement, as the insurgent campesinos have been 
warned by their leaders -- with good reason -- will drive them from their 
homesteads, or ejidos , and force them to work in maquiladoras , the assembly 
plants that will spread to southern Mexico from the northern border. The NAFTA 
threat is the most recent of a litany of grievances the Tzeltal Mayas and their 
neighbors have nurtured for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Lacandon forest where thousands of Tzeltals scratch out a bare 
subsistence, the Mexican government gave huge tracts of hardwood forest to 400 
Lacandon Mayas, who have lived there for centuries. The government then 
proceeded to denude the forest of its mahoganies and cedars, for which they 
paid a pittance. The thousands of dispossessed Tzeltals who were crowded into 
small homesteads in the Lacandon forest aggravated their plight by introducing 
the dominant culture's chain saws and Zebu cattle, thereby completing the 
forest's depletion and subverting their traditional Mayan agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tzeltals' desperation accounts for the appeal of Emiliano Zapata, the 
revolutionary and Nahua Indian from the state of Morelia, who fought for a more 
equitable reapportionment of public lands. Zapata, a visionary mystic as well 
as legendary combatant, conceived of a utopian "neolithic village" -- in 
Octavio Paz's phrase -- that has taken root in the Mexican soul. Zapata's 
idyllic villagers work equal shares of communal lands and coexist peacefully, 
with dignity and justice. 
</P>
<P>
 In the eyes of the Mayan campesinos , who were denied the fruits of the 1910 
Mexican Revolution -- most of its reforms stopped well short of the Chiapas 
border -- Zapata must seem a demigod, half religious icon and half mythic 
warrior. His driven sense of grievance and his thirst for social justice have 
struck a chord for the Mayan insurgents not unlike that struck by Chiapas 
Bishop Bartolome de las Casas, the colonial defender of the Indians, and by his 
heir apparent, the current Bishop of San Cristobal Samuel Ruiz, who has long 
been an advocate of the indigenous communities. These men personify a concept 
of human rights that the Mayan peasant never knew from the Spanish conquerors 
or their mixed-breed successors, the ladinos ; nor, for that matter, did they 
learn this concept from their Maya kings, who ruled by strict hierarchal fiat. 
</P>
<P>
 This is part of the symbolic underpinning that fuels the current Tzeltal 
revolt, as it did the uprisings of 1712 and the 19th Century. The same causes 
fuel the rebellion by the compatriots of Rigoberta Menchu -- the 1992 Nobel 
Peace prize winner -- in neighboring Guatemala, where as many as 120,000 
indigenous Mayas have been killed in the course of a 30-year war of military 
counterinsurgency against leftist guerrilla organizations. In the highlands of 
Guatemala, tens of thousands of Mayan "civil defense" patrollers carry dummy 
wooden rifles and Mauser muzzleloaders just like their Tzeltal counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 The despair on the faces of the Mayas seen on CNN and Televisa suggest they 
are in this war for the long haul. Whether their true enemy is NAFTA and a 
Mexican government intent on joining the First World. at the expense of its 
poor peasants, remains a matter of conjecture. Whether or not their revolt will 
lead to a redress of their grievances, the one certainty is that the poor Mayan 
peasants who carved the dummy wooden rifles, and those who obtained and fired 
the real thing, equate the loss of their milpas with the loss of their last 
shreds of human dignity. Without it, they will have nothing worth living for.

THE DOOMSDAY SPIN; TALES OF RADIOATION TESTS SEEM TO PROVE EVERY CITIZEN'S 
WORST NIGHTMARE ABOUT GOVERNMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREGG EASTERBROOK, Gregg Easterbrook is a contributing editor to Newsweek 
and the Atlantic Monthly. His book on the historical significance of 
environmentalism, A Moment on the Earth, will be published by Viking Penguin.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The revelation could not have been more shocking: In 1945, Eda Charlton, a 
seamstress who checked into a Rochester, N.Y., hospital for routine care, was, 
without her knowledge, injected with plutonium as part of a secret Manhattan 
Project program to test the effects of radiation on human beings. By the time 
she died in 1983, at age 85, Charlton had never been told the truth. Her 
children only recently learned the full details, when disclosures of secret 
tests of radioactivity on unsuspecting citizens became a leading news event. 
</P>
<P>
 Since any medical test performed without informed consent is an abomination, 
government mistreatment of Charlton was an outrage; as were radiation tests 
staged, the Department of Energy admitted last month, on an estimated 800 
additional Americans during the 1940s and 1950s with no meaningful approval 
from the subjects. Public anger about government duplicity and violation of 
rights is amply justified. 
</P>
<P>
 But to maximize the instant-doomsday spin, the current controversy is skipping 
over an inconvenient little complication: Hardly any actual harm was done, 
because the exposures involved were to extremely low levels of radiation. 
What's really going on in the radiation testing controversy? Consider several 
aspects. 
</P>
<P>
 After the story broke, the Washington Post, reflecting the conventional 
wisdom, declared plutonium to be so dangerous that "human contact with even one 
particle is guaranteed to cause cancer." Yet, Charlton was injected with far 
more and lived an additional four decades -- some 30 years longer than 
statistical expectancy for a white woman of her birth year. And when she died, 
it was due to a heart attack -- not cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 News reports focus on the violation of Charlton's rights and the scary facts 
of the experiment -- without mentioning the dose was incredibly tiny. Charlton 
received one-third of a microcurie of plutonium. A microcurie is millionth of a 
curie: One-third of a microcurie is far less radiation than caused by the new 
low-dose X-ray machines. 
</P>
<P>
 A common assertion in instant-doomsday literature is that plutonium has an 
almost mystical hyper-toxicity. No one doubts plutonium is extremely dangerous. 
But if what the Charlton case shows is that plutonium is just another dangerous 
substance that must be controlled, this would be terrible news to 
instant-doomsday orthodoxy. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, many commentators now suggest that shocking horrors occurred when 
radiation was released in the 1940s and 1950s from the federal nuclear-bomb 
production plant at Hanford, Wash., a facility that had minimal environmental 
safeguards in the Cold War years, and, though now closed, still suffers from 
ecological blunders during its cleanup. Hanford releases are now regularly 
described in news accounts as "hundreds of times worse than Three Mile Island." 
</P>
<P>
 This is true -- but it tells more about the smallness of the Three Mile Island 
release than anything else. Average exposure downwind of Three Mile Island was 
about 10 millirems -- or about 3% of the average annual background level of 360 
millirems that Americans receive from natural sources.  
</P>
<P>
 Researchers have been studying the workers and 270,000 downwind residents of 
Hanford for seven years and, so far, have found "no firm evidence that any of 
the releases harmed human health," the technical journal, Science, reported 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The English researcher Alice Stewart, a leading authority on radiation, has 
studied Hanford workers from the Cold War years -- workers being far more 
directly exposed than residents downwind. Stewart found they have, so far, 
experienced slightly less cancer than typical for Washington state. To my 
knowledge, none of the many news accounts about Hanford have mentioned 
Stewart's work. 
</P>
<P>
 These new radiation stories resonate because the government has a history of 
lying about early Cold War atomic abuses. Federal officials have long denied 
the truth about severe health damage suffered in the 1940s and 1950s by uranium 
miners, mainly Navajo Indians, who worked under subhuman conditions; officials 
lied for years about the harm suffered by people living downwind of 1950s 
open-air nuclear tests and by soldiers deliberately exposed to fallout from 
atomic tests. 
</P>
<P>
 This history of federal lies about radiation abuses during the 1950s inclines 
commentators and the public to assume the worst about any new disclosure. Such 
an assumption is wise, for federal credibility on atomic matters is low to 
nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Energy has been claiming for years that the awful truth 
about the 1950s is finally out. This promise keeps turning out to be false. In 
1986, the DOE declassified information about the infamous Green Run at Hanford, 
a test where radiation was emitted to track its distribution downwind. At that 
time, the DOE said the last abuses of the 1950s had finally been made public. 
Three years later, however, the DOE, under new Secretary James D. Watkins, 
began to admit to many more unreported 1950s radiation leaks. Today, the new 
energy secretary, Hazel R. O'Leary, swears the last awful details are public. 
Who believes her? No one. 
</P>
<P>
 This scandal also resonates because a significant number of Americans exhibit 
an almost clinical paranoia in believing themselves victims of secret 
government tests -- the same way people regard fluoride in drinking water as a 
conspiracy. Supermarket tabloids and right-wing call-in shows thrive on claims 
that people have suffered horrible, unsubstantiated abuses at the hands of evil 
government agents, usually from an agency far more secret than the CIA. Now 
comes word that 800 people were actual victims of secret government tests: What 
great news for the paranoia industry! 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more to the point, in the United States one person in four develops 
cancer. This means there are millions of Americans who might wonder if their 
cancers were caused by evil government tests -- or might prefer to believe they 
were, rather than blame themselves for the lifestyles choices (mainly cigarette 
smoking, high-fat diets and lack of exercise) that medical researchers now 
believe account for around 80% of cancers. 
</P>
<P>
 For, while many specifics of the testing scandal are new, much else is not. 
Information about the Green Run experiment was declassified in 1986. The 
recently quoted memorandum warning top government officials that radiation 
medical tests suggest a "touch of Buchenwald" was declassified in 1974. Some 
radiation tests currently being revealed as shocking new disclosures were even 
reported in open medical literature during the 1950s -- though with identifying 
details deleted. References to the tests can be found in textbooks of 
radiological medicine. These tests formed the basis of radiological medicine. 
Of course, most people don't know that, since who, except bleary-eyed med 
students, ever opens a radiology textbook? 
</P>
<P>
 Some commentators have attempted limited defenses of these tests, by noting 
that 1950s politics were driven by Cold War fears in which many sacrifices for 
nuclear knowledge seemed justified. And, at any rate, in the 1950s no one 
really knew whether radiation was dangerous, and research standards of the time 
were far loose than today. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the point about ignorance of radiation in the 1950s is true. For example, 
in the late 1940s, it was common for shoes stores to blast children's feet with 
far stronger X-rays than today used in chest X-rays, in a gimmicky search for 
the "scientific fit." This practice stopped only after a public campaign 
against it lead by a then-obscure pediatric surgeon named C. Everett Koop. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the mid-1950s it was common for obstetricians, especially in England, 
to blast pregnant women's wombs with X-rays far stronger than the worst 
exposure in the current radiation testing controversy, to view the developing 
fetus. (Harmless sonogram viewing of the fetus had yet to be developed.) This 
practice, which today seems insane -- given that X-rays were shined on the 
fetus during early cell division, the phase most vulnerable to mutation -- was 
stopped only after a campaign lead by Alice Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rationale that standards of consent were more relaxed is a whitewash. 
The standards were just as strong in the 1950s as today. The reason researchers 
were sneaking around about the radiation tests is that they knew the subjects 
would never give consent if fully informed. This violation of patients' right 
represents a genuine outrage, undimmed by any notion of changing ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 To emphasize the mad-scientist spin, accounts suggest people were exposed to 
radiation in the 1950s to make them sick. In the case of prison inmates, whose 
testicles were irradiated to induce sterility, this is true and an ethical 
outrage. 
</P>
<P>
 But in other cases, the radiation was used not to induce sickness but as a 
tracer in a test of something else. For example, the children at the Fernald 
State School in Waltham, Mass., who, without parents' true consent, received 
breakfast cereal that was slightly radioactive were being studied to see how 
the body absorbs nutrients. Using radiation as a tracer is an entirely 
respectable form of research or therapy: exactly what a barium scan is, for 
instance. 
</P>
<P>
 That many of the 1950s tests involved radiation being used as a tracer is 
being downplayed. Because in tracer experiments, only minute doses are used; 
doomsayers would rather that go unmentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, a large team of federal researchers has been engaged in something 
called the Hanford Dose Reconstruction Study, trying to estimate how much 
radioactivity was released. The study's authors now believe that, from 1944-47 
-- the peak period for Hanford leaks -- about 685,000 curies of radiation were 
released. The Three Mile Island leak was about 17 curies. Yet it may be that 
Hanford workers are not especially sick. 
</P>
<P>
 The most basic reason for this counterintuitive outcome is that most of the 
radiation, like most radiation in bomb-test fallout, did not result in 
exposure. Though nuclear wastes have half-lives thousands of years long, the 
most common form of radioactivity in fallout and Hanford leaks was iodine 131 
-- with a half-life of eight days. If washed out of the air by rain, iodine 131 
can be quite dangerous. If carried away on the winds, it soon cools to 
harmlessness. Most of the Hanford leaks, like most nuclear-test fallout, was 
carried away rather than washed down onto the innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 There were tragic and horrible exceptions. Some people who lived immediately 
downwind, particularly children who played outside because their parents were 
not warned, suffered horrible deaths at young ages. But the majority of 
"downwinders" were only mildly exposed.  
</P>
<P>
 Another reason the Hanford leaks may have done less harm than expected is the 
emerging scientific understanding that all mammal bodies possess some genetic 
resistance to radiation. After all, human beings evolved in an environment 
constantly exposed to natural radiation from the sun and from mild natural 
radioactivity in some ores and some forms of soil. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a paradox: The natural background radiation in Denver, Colo., is about 
50% higher than in most U.S. cities, because Colorado has mildly radioactive 
soil and the thinner air of the mile-high city allows in more solar and cosmic 
radiation. Yet, Denver also has a notably lower rate of cancer than other 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddities such as this have caused some researchers, prominently Rosalyn Yalow, 
to suspect that small exposures to radiation may be slightly beneficial. Yallow 
won the Nobel Prize in 1977 for her part in the development of the 
radioimmunoassay -- the basic test by which radioactive harm to the body is 
measured.  
</P>
<P>
 The important message of the unauthorized 1950s radiation tests is that even 
liberal democratic governments sometimes cheerfully ignore the rights of 
citizens. No warning of the danger of casual government abuse of civilians can 
ever be exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the instant-doomsday aspects of the scandal appear largely 
hyperbole. For years, the environmental community has advanced the notion that 
even small amounts of radiation represent a mystical mega-danger, of which 
society ought to live in utter dread. Why do they so vehemently warn against 
what is, at worst, a speculative threat? Because nuclear-power plants cannot 
explode but can emit tiny amounts of radiation. Continuing public dread of even 
tiny levels of radiation is the enviros' main argument against nuclear power -- 
which has many problems but which, on ecological grounds, may actually be good 
for society. (No greenhouse gases, no air pollution, no strip mining or oil 
spills.) 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as the radiation-testing abuses and radiation leaks of the 1950s continue 
to be disclosed and assessed, and the health damage caused continues to appear 
nowhere near as bad as projected, the 1950s scandals may become an argument 
that low levels of radiation are far less worrisome than once assumed.

CAN U.S. REASSUME ROLE OF EUROPE'S FATHER FIGURE?; DIPLOMACY: THE EUROPEAN 
FAMILY APPEARS DYSFUNCTIONAL. AND THE MOST TROUBLESOME ADOLESCENTS ARE 
DISINCLINED TO BELIEVE THAT DADDY KNOWS BEST. 
</P>

Guardian, and author of The Cold War: A History, to be published by Holt in 
April.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Clinton enters this week on his uncomfortable inheritance as the 
father-figure for the dysfunctional European family. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Presidents have always had to treat the Western European allies as a 
particularly troublesome adolescent -- big and strong enough to stand on its 
own feet, but still needing the assurance of paternal control. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the European family has widened to include the frightened children of 
Eastern Europe, huddling for NATO's protection against their age-old fears of 
the Russian bogey man. And in Russia, the United States is taking 
responsibility for an autistic young adult, potentially powerful, but 
terrifyingly unpredictable, barely in control and still unformed. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton got to the White House by attacking George Bush as "a foreign-policy 
President" who did too little for Americans at home. Now he arrives in Europe 
today for the most important foreign trip of his presidency so far, believing 
that much of his domestic agenda depends on his ability to calm and stabilize a 
Europe that some of his advisers fear is unraveling. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not just the unending war in Bosnia -- itself a standing denunciation 
of any grandiose plans for a new North Atlantic Treaty Organization mission. 
But the dangerous and new equation is plain enough. Most of Clinton's plans for 
domestic U.S. reform -- and his hopes for a quiescent international scene -- 
depend on Russia's orderly transition to a free-market democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 From the anticipated savings in the U.S. defense budget to maintaining the 
U.N. Security Council consensus, the United States has grown accustomed to 
Russia as a partner rather than a rival, and Clinton's worst fear would be any 
revival of the old Cold War antagonisms. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, relations with the traditional NATO allies of Western Europe 
are ragged, bruised by the arguments over Bosnia and the hard-fought compromise 
over world trade in the General Agreement Tariffs and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hand-holding time again for Europe," sighed one senior State Department 
official last week. "A lot of us thought that the end of the Cold War meant we 
would not have to play the psychological role of Daddy again. But the Europeans 
still need their American comfort blanket, and I guess we have to remind 
America that the stability of Europe is a vital U.S. strategic interest." 
</P>
<P>
 So Clinton leaves with a four-part agenda: to mollify his European allies; to 
revitalize NATO; to reassure the worried Eastern Europeans, and to chart the 
West's relations with the problematic new Russia that is emerging after last 
month's parliamentary elections. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Clinton's first voyage across the Atlantic since taking office is 
three parts symbolism to one part substance. But the one substantial new policy 
he brings is of crucial importance to all the rest: His new compromise new 
proposal for the future of NATO. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbed "Partnership for Peace," this plan seeks to offer Hungary, Poland and 
the Czech and Slovak Republics a kind of country membership of NATO, a 
structure for cooperation pointedly designed to fend off Russian fears of 
isolation by extending the NATO alliance up to Russia's borders. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a highly contentious proposal, which has left Poland's Lech Walesa 
warning that without a firm NATO military umbrella, Eastern Europe could face 
"a major tragedy -- another Yugoslavia." And back in the United States, a 
fractious debate has begun over the new foreign-policy priority of doing 
nothing which could complicate Boris N. Yeltsin's relations with his generals, 
or provoke nationalist sentiment in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Strobe Talbott, just nominated to be the new deputy Secretary of State, while 
maintaining his stewardship of policies toward Russia and the former Soviet 
republics, is the main author of this policy. His long friendship with Clinton 
gives him unrivaled access and influence with the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Talbott believes that keeping Russia on track toward a free-market democracy, 
and as a cooperative partner in world affairs, is such a central U.S. strategic 
interest that other issues, from Eastern Europe to the increasing assertiveness 
of Russia toward its "near abroad," must take second place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Partnership For Peace" -- known to the diplomatic world as P4P -- is almost 
certain to be approved by the NATO summit. The European allies are so relieved 
to be back on top of the U.S. agenda, after the Asian flirtations of Clinton's 
first year, that they are silencing their doubts. Any sign of firm U.S. 
leadership for NATO, the British and Germans agree, is better than last year's 
casual dismissal by U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher that U.S. policy 
had been "too Eurocentric for too long." 
</P>
<P>
 After smoothing ruffled feathers of the Western Europeans at the NATO summit 
in Brussels, the White House plan trusts the Eastern Europeans will be 
reassured by their meeting with Clinton on his next stop, in Prague. U.S. 
diplomats have been warning Prague, Budapest and Warsaw not to complain too 
loudly about "Partnership for Peace," or they could jeopardize even that 
limited NATO embrace. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton will stress to Presidents Vaclav Havel and Walesa that "the angel is 
in the details" -- and that P4P's program of joint military exercises and 
training represents a back door into eventual NATO membership. But he will 
emphasize that, in this crucial transition period in Russia, it is in the 
interests of Eastern Europe as well as NATO not to alarm the Russian military 
and its nationalists that a new defensive line is being drawn through Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 In Moscow, Clinton will stress his continued commitment to Yeltsin in person, 
and to the process of Russian reform in general, and has no plans to meet the 
leader of the extreme nationalist party, Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky. He will also 
try to rebuild the consensus among Russia, the G-7 Western nations and the 
international finance institutions -- the World Bank and International Monetary 
Fund -- about the strategy of Western support for Russian reform. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of Russia's elections, interpreted by Yeltsin and in Washington as 
a protest vote against the social costs of economic reform, Clinton, Vice 
President Al Gore and Talbott all said the West should help bring "more therapy 
and less shock" to the process of Russia's transition to a free-market economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, who also travels to Russia this month, 
agrees with the Europeans, the World Bank and the IMF that a country with 
15%-20% inflation each month can hardly be said to have been hit by the shock 
therapy of full-blooded economic reform.  
</P>
<P>
 A compromise is likely, if it can be agreed in talks with Yeltsin, under which 
the West might marginally relax its conditions on Russian inflation rates to 
provide more funds to stabilize the currency and help build a social safety net 
for the poor and unemployed. In return, Russia's central bank would have to 
clamp down on its monetary supply, and recent Russian controls on the access of 
foreign banks and foreign investors to the Russian economy would have to be 
eased. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, the Clinton Administration is calling this its "Year of Europe" -- 
though the use of this phrase, which offended Europeans when Henry A. Kissinger 
coined it in 1974, is banned. American irritation with Europe's periodic fits 
of vapors is understandable enough, when Europeans whimper for America's 
paternal attention and then fret rebelliously when Big Daddy rubs it in. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of this year, Europe should have sufficient U.S. attention to start 
complaining about it again. There will be three more presidential visits across 
the Atlantic after this one.  
</P>
<P>
 By then, NATO and the Eastern Europeans should be content with all this 
presidential quality time. But across what is emerging as Europe's de facto new 
frontier in Russia, the autistic orphan may well be fractious and threatening 
enough to resume Moscow's old strategic role as the threat binding the rest of 
Europe and America together. If so, Europe will expect delays in Clinton's 
desired defense cuts. A big stick is required to play the role of Big Daddy.

THE ISSUE THAT MAY SPOIL THE CHANCE FOR MIDEAST PEACE; ISRAEL: AT ISSUE IS NOT 
JUST LAND FOR SECURITY. THE FUTURE IDENTITY OF THE JEWISH STATE -- JUDAISM VS. 
SECULARISM -- MAY BE AT STAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Stephen Games, Stephen Games is a contributing writer to the Jewish Journal 
of Greater Los Angeles and a former British Press Award winner. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As Israeli and Palestinian negotiators limp from Oslo to Versailles to Cairo, 
some comfort can be taken in the fact that at least both parties agree that the 
only way to achieve their goals is by talking. But as the bargaining continues, 
another more problematic dialogue is not taking place -- that between Israelis 
and Israelis. 
</P>
<P>
 While supporters of the peace accord talk of an integration of both societies 
within a no-longer dysfunctional Middle East, objectors feel stifled. They fear 
that what is at stake is not just the trading of land for security but 
something deeper that isn't being articulated: the future identity of the 
Jewish state. 
</P>
<P>
 The anxiety is that a government that sees justice in the Palestinian cause 
will also see justice in other civil-rights issues and will move to curb, even 
eradicate, Judaism as Israel's official religion. The Meretz Party, which makes 
up the left wing of the ruling Labor coalition, has been increasingly vocal 
about the need for reform, arguing in favor of some form of establishment 
clause such as that enshrined in the U.S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Without being in any way a theocracy, Israeli life is dominated by rabbinic 
authorities who have a say in many of the country's rituals and regulations: 
marriage, divorce, burial, food, army recruitment, the civil observance of the 
Sabbath and so on. Although the rabbinate was central to the minds of the 
mainly secular founders of the state in 1948, it has come under growing 
criticism for its inflexibility and, many would say, hypocrisy. 
</P>
<P>
 Meretz and other progressive critics resent what they see as an Orthodox 
monopoly. They hold that Jews in Israel enjoy fewer human rights than non-Jews, 
who are not bound by rabbinic restrictions. Traditional Jewish law may have 
protected the Jewish people during its 2,000 years of dispersion, but this job, 
they say, is now performed by Israel. They see contemporary Judaism not as a 
religion but as an open-ended cultural process, absorbing a range of influences 
that take it ever farther from the fossilizing tendencies of Orthodoxy. 
</P>
<P>
 The religious right finds all this shocking. It regards the provision by 
Meretz of a Jerusalem bus service to fill the absence of a Sabbath transit 
system for Friday-night disco-goers, or the decision by Knesset member Yael 
Dayan, daughter of the military hero Moshe Dayan, to spend Yom Kippur in a 
bikini at the beach, as deliberate provocations. It finds perverse the left's 
enthusiasm to install Palestinians in West Bank settlements and to suggest that 
displaced Jews move to notoriously hostile Arab cities such as Shechem or 
Ramallah. 
</P>
<P>
 But many more than just the Orthodox are alarmed that the peace talks are 
being used as a test bed for social change. While most Jews in Israel do not 
want to see Israel turned into a religious enclave, they share the concern that 
any move to separate church and state would not only deny 3,000 years of Jewish 
aspiration but also Israel's modern-day purpose -- the provision of a Jewish 
homeland -- making its continued survival relatively pointless and far harder 
to defend, intellectually as well as militarily.  
</P>
<P>
 Quite apart from questions of national security, it is the idea that 
Israeli-Palestinian coexistence can only work under conditions of state 
secularism that pushes the country's panic buttons. In order not to deprive 
non-Jews of their rights, those laws that privilege Jews, including, 
ultimately, the Law of Return, which gives all Jews the right to Israeli 
citizenship, would need to be repealed. If this is the logical consequence of 
what is being decided at the peace table, even the most secular, long-time 
Zionist is going to have trouble with it. 
</P>
<P>
 What has confused the issue are the attempts by Israel to portray these fears 
as the special province of the Orthodox. But the polarization of the situation 
into a standoff between the secular and the ultra-Orthodox misrepresents the 
large body of Israelis -- and diaspora Jews -- who have strong beliefs but 
identify with neither group.  
</P>
<P>
 It fails to recognize the ebbing of support for a trade-off between territory 
and peace, and invites the objection that if an unfamiliar peace means the end 
to Zionism, they'll stick with the conflict they know. 
</P>
<P>
 This is what gave rise to the unexpected remarks by former Chief Rabbi Shlomo 
Goren when he called on Israeli soldiers to disobey if ordered to evacuate the 
settlements. Goren was finally choosing to put his own interpretation of 
religious law above the provisions of state law, after having been a respected 
and longstanding mediator between church and state. Not surprisingly, the 
government reacted angrily. 
</P>
<P>
 But Goren's outburst was symbolic of a volcano now rumbling in Israel. Beneath 
the surface of those who welcome the inevitable outcome of peace -- a 
constitution with the equivalent of a First Amendment -- a force is building 
that seeks to preserve Israel's special status as a Jewish homeland partly 
bound by laws that few willingly abide by.  
</P>
<P>
 That force is looking for an outlet before it explodes.

CAMPUS CORRESPONDENCE; THE SAD PRICE OF BEING INNOCENTLY INCORRECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL PADOLSKY, Daniel Padolsky is a first-year graduate student in English 
at Cal Poly.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Each morning, Trace and I rode to school together on the bus, leaving behind 
the conflicts and confines of our lower-middle-class apartments in Fox Hills to 
invade a foreign land -- middle-class Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
 We were the outsiders; but our foreigner status helped to bond us and spark 
the beginning of a friendship. 
</P>
<P>
 Trace is an African-American and I a Russian Jew, but these identities never 
occurred to us at the age of 7; we simply accepted each other, as children tend 
to do when not taught to hate. We were also drawn to each other by the shared 
pain of our parents' divorces; our time together was a salve on our emotional 
wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Often at lunch, Trace and I talked and joked about what was happening in class 
or on the playground. Whenever he said something funny, his exaggerated, toothy 
smile would surface. Sometimes, when I pestered him then laughed, he feigned 
anger. We never really fought, though. 
</P>
<P>
 Trace was superb at playing sports. He was thin and fast. I greatly admired 
his ability, spirit and determination. "Soco," which resembles dodge ball, was 
the game at school, and Trace excelled at it. He was often the sole survivor of 
his team. 
</P>
<P>
 But one day, I innocently exploded the bomb that would destroy our six-year 
friendship. We were on the bus, he sitting behind me. As usual, we were joking 
about something. I placed my hands on his round, slightly puffy cheeks and 
squeezed. I thought the resulting expression was hilarious. "Look, he's a 
monkey!" I exclaimed with a laugh. "You look like a monkey, Trace!" 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't flinch. He just let me have my way. When I stopped horsing around, 
there was a stillness in the air that I didn't understand. I tried to reassure 
myself that he really did look like a monkey, but I knew something was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months later, I began to notice that Trace and I weren't talking much 
any more. I thought it curious, but didn't know what to do. One day after the 
bus had dropped us off near home, I asked him if he was angry at me. He curtly 
replied, "no." His response puzzled me. I could understand anger but his 
attitude was something altogether different. Before I had a better opportunity 
to talk with him, I moved away. 
</P>
<P>
 My "monkey" comments, though innocent, must have struck a raw, racial nerve in 
Trace. At 12 years old, I had no idea what the word monkey connotes to 
African-Americans. I was misunderstood and had to face the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the thought that Trace is no longer a part of my life depresses me. 
Thirteen years have passed since I last saw him. I wonder what might have 
happened to our friendship if I had never called him a "monkey" or if we had 
talked about what I had said. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Trace's graduation class may hold its 10-year reunion. If it does, 
I plan to attend, though I had left the school before graduation. I wonder what 
will happen when we meet again as adults?

A WORRIED GENERATION OF STUDENTS; FEE HIKES IN UC SYSTEM AND ELSEWHERE POSE 
DAUNTING OBSTACLES TO MANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't so long ago that the biggest worry facing college-bound students was 
simply getting into their school of choice. Flush with revenue, states like 
California spent prodigiously on public higher education. Tuition was cheap, 
ample financial aid was available and class offerings seemed boundless. And all 
the while, skyrocketing enrollments were being accommodated. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately those days are gone -- maybe for good. A new generation of 
college students who had the misfortune to come of age in an era of severe 
economic limits worries not about which college to attend but whether it can 
afford to attend any college and whether course schedules will permit 
graduation within five or six -- forget four -- years. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, fees at California schools have increased by a burdensome 128% and 
would be hiked again under Gov. Pete Wilson's budget proposal. Compare that to 
the nation's private colleges and universities, in which tuition rose 127% over 
a much longer period, 1982 to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Costs are driving increasing numbers of people away from higher education. 
Tuition hikes at the state's community colleges, for example, are thought to be 
responsible, at least in part, for a 9% decline in attendance (another major 
factor, especially for adult students, is California's struggling economy). 
</P>
<P>
 Now administrators are eyeing students attending medical, law and business 
schools, hoping to charge them $2,000 more than other graduate and 
undergraduate students. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions of fairness aside, what's clear is that today's students face 
problems their predecessors never had to consider. Those problems may not be 
getting appropriate attention from university administrators who are pushing 
for more tuition hikes -- or from those who govern the UC system, namely the 
California Board of Regents. For this reason Ward Connerly, the newly seated 
regent who pointedly and publicly has said that the UC family consists of more 
than one "constituency," should be taken seriously by his fellow regents and by 
the administration of the university. 
</P>
<P>
 In flush times the regents could afford to be little more than happy 
co-administrators of a thriving University of California system. But with that 
system in crisis, the board must govern more broadly. As Connerly pointed out, 
the board must now do more than "hire a president and (vote) 'aye' on every 
issue placed before us by the president." One way to do that would be to worry 
more about students.

THE POLICE REFORM THAT MUST NOT DIE; COMMUNITY-POLICING PUSH AFFIRMS CITY HALL 
COMMITMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One nagging fear about Richard Riordan when he was running for mayor last 
summer was that he was not in truth deeply committed to thorough reform of the 
Los Angeles Police Department. But now, at least on the evidence of his first 
few months in office, that would be a hard case to make. After all, he couldn't 
be more visible in his support of Police Chief Willie L. Williams, who was the 
nearly unanimous selection to take over the department amid the ashes of the 
Rodney King controversy and the inept police response to the 1992 riots. And 
the mayor has hunted anywhere and everywhere to find funds for more police 
officers -- absolutely vital in themselves because the city is shockingly 
underpoliced but also vitally necessary for the proposed reforms, which 
emphasize the labor-intensive philosophy of community policing. A BIG PLAN: And 
now, reinforcing the increasing optimism about police reform, the city has 
unveiled its most ambitious community-policing plan to date. It involves 
deploying 30 experienced officers in a large, crime-plagued area of the city. 
These lead officers are to join with community leaders and citizen volunteers 
in an alliance against street crime. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a major and very public redeployment of officers; failure would be 
highly visible. And the effort takes no shrinking-violet approach: The 
department did not choose some country-club precinct for the rollout but 
instead an often crime-troubled stretch that extends from the downtown section 
of the Santa Monica Freeway to the southern edge of the city -- the territory 
of the LAPD's South Bureau. The area has a population of 750,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was announced with fanfare at a high departmental level -- by 
Deputy Los Angeles Police Chief Mark A. Kroeker, who has said he sees nurturing 
his officers' personal involvement with the community they serve as a top 
priority. Kroeker, who now heads the South Bureau, enjoyed success with 
community outreach programs when he was San Fernando Valley commander. He was 
more inclined to such community-oriented policing programs than some of his 
bosses downtown, who tended to favor glitzy specialized units and tactical 
forces under headquarters command. A BIG SWITCH: That approach had its sincere 
defenders, of course: Especially when a police department has too few officers 
for the territory it must police, the temptation is to use high technology and 
centralized units to maximize results. But, interestingly, the 
headquarters-unit style was not favored by LAPD Chief Ed Davis, who retired 
from the department in 1978. In fact, Davis was a nationally recognized 
proponent of community policing, an approach all but abandoned by his 
successor. 
</P>
<P>
 Community policing rose from the dead in the famous Christopher Commission 
Report of 1991, which proposed this street-based approach because of a deep 
worry that the LAPD had not only grown alienated from much of the community but 
had actually antagonized important portions of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus the new approach developed not only in response to growing citizen fears 
about crime but also in response to growing concerns that the department had 
become its own worst enemy, closing itself off from the community and, in 
effect, pulling up the drawbridge. 
</P>
<P>
 It is therefore deeply reassuring to see that City Hall appears to be 
embracing, not abandoning, the hard work and substantial wisdom of the 
Christopher Commission.

'THREE STRIKES' PLAN FOR FELONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Regarding the announcement by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown that he hopes to 
get the "three strikes" crime initiative on June's ballot (Jan. 5): 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of California residents live their daily lives in fear of random 
violence and most of us will never commit a violent crime. Yet, the proposed 
initiative will give those purveyors of violent crime three felony 
opportunities before we remove them from society. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative is a nice start and should be supported, but why are we 
starting with such leniency? What is wrong with demanding of our neighbors and 
visitors that they refrain from committing just one violent felony, lest they 
be removed from society forever? The vast majority of our population already 
upholds this simple gesture of civility, and our lawmakers shouldn't feel it is 
too much to ask of everyone! There is no excuse for random violence in our 
society, and our continued tolerance of it is what got us here in the first 
place.

 * In response to "Lawmakers Take Quick Aim at Crime," Jan. 4: 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder there is so much crime in Los Angeles and throughout the United 
States. The so-called law is much too lenient. A convicted criminal should have 
learned that a violent crime is unforgivable after being incarcerated the first 
time. If he or she is caught and convicted the second time, he or she should be 
given life imprisonment without possibility of parole or the death penalty, 
depending on the circumstances of the crime. If we wait for the third time, it 
is too late. 
</P>
<P>
 When criminals are incarcerated, we have a captive audience to punish and 
teach these people right from wrong. We cannot give these "animals" a chance to 
do bodily and/or mental harm a third time. 
</P>
<P>
 We cannot pamper the criminal and let innocent people suffer.

 * Gov. Pete Wilson on crime and prisons (Dec. 30): 
</P>
<P>
 Longer sentences! Build more prisons! For people who cost taxpayers $25,000 
each for every year served. They get warm, clean beds, food, clothing, TV sets, 
radios, exercise equipment, etc.  
</P>
<P>
 They don't get rehabilitation, education or vocational training. 
</P>

 I think Gov. Wilson is a twit. Just imagine what could be done with creative 
thinking! Come on, Californians, start writing letters to Sacramento.

 * Maybe John Garamendi and Pete Wilson should rename their crime reform policy 
"three strikes you're in" rather than "three strikes you're out." If we are to 
believe Garamendi's characterization of California's prisons as providing more 
security and privileges for their inmates (Dec. 29) than possessed by most 
law-abiding Californians, then surely many of us would prefer to be on the 
inside more so than on the outside. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, if Garamendi takes his own rhetoric seriously, I suggest that he take 
a therapeutic break from his political campaigning and check into the Los 
Angeles County jail for one weekend, and bask in the security and privileges 
which all presumed innocent residents of this resort receive.

 * In your article "Laws '94" (Dec. 31), you note that the California 
Legislature, with Pete Wilson's blessing, has passed laws which would give 
longer prison sentences to criminals.

 Inasmuch as California's prisons are already bursting at the seams due to 
overcrowding, where, for Pete's sake, do our noble lawmakers plan to 
incarcerate our ignoble lawbreakers?

 * In reply to Deputy Dist. Atty. Walter H. Lewis (letter, Dec. 29): 
</P>
<P>
 Under the tenure of left-leaning Gov. Jerry Brown and his anti-death penalty 
Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird and other liberal court appointees, crime was 
always in check and most Californians felt a strong degree of personal safety 
and security. Then, the criminals cowered. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in just under 12 years, Republican Govs. George Deukmejian and Pete 
Wilson appointed and packed the California state courts with judges that 
overwhelmingly shared their belief on such a basically myopic litmus-test issue 
as the death penalty. Crime in our state is rampant and rapidly escalating with 
abatement, or even just containment, nowhere in sight. Today, criminals are 
emboldened. The law-abiding live in fear. 
</P>
<P>
 In my opinion the Democrats and the Republicans have articulated and 
implemented their anti-crime positions and the scales of justice tilt heavily 
in favor of the Democrats.

MALPRACTICE AND TORT REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to "What We Need Is Real Tort Reform -- Not Snake Oil," 
Commentary, Dec. 28: 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992 my daughter was seriously injured in a car accident, and we are now 
close to settling the claim with the insurance company. She will need several 
more specialized surgeries, and will probably be left with residual problems. 
Because there is a great deal of insurance money, and because of the nature of 
her injuries, we are expecting a significant settlement. However, the amazing 
thing about our case is that the legal fee (a 25% contingency fee) to settle 
the insurance will far surpass the total medical costs to date. These medical 
costs have included major orthopedic surgery on her hip, femur and ankle, two 
weeks hospitalization, four months of physical therapy, plastic surgery, head 
injury evaluation, over 100 X-rays, CAT scan, numerous laboratory tests and 
medications, and follow-up care. 
</P>
<P>
 How can President Clinton even discuss health care and pharmaceutical cutbacks 
and cost controls when legal fees are clearly out of control, and lawyers 
continue to have the legal clout to demand such huge amounts of money out of 
our nation's insurance and medical dollars?

<P>
 * An estimated 80,000 Americans die in hospitals from medical negligence each 
year, and hundreds of thousands more are injured. The suggestion that limiting 
compensation to malpractice victims would help solve the nation's health care 
crisis is a cruel hoax. 
</P>
<P>
 The proof is right here in California. In 1975, the state Legislature capped 
compensation for pain and suffering, limited attorneys' fees and enacted a 
variety of other restrictions on the legal rights of malpractice victims at the 
behest of the insurance and medical lobbies. Yet, since 1975, the cost of 
health care in California has been higher and has grown faster than in the 
nation as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 The restrictions have had little effect on the overall cost of health care 
because all the compensation paid to victims of medical malpractice in 
California amounts to about one-half of 1% of the state's total health 
expenditures each year (the national figure is 1/10th of a point higher). Even 
a complete ban on malpractice suits would have no appreciable impact on the 
health care crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents contend that "tort reform" will lower the cost of so-called 
defensive medicine. It hasn't in California: The rate of Cesarean sections -- 
which physicians claim are often performed out of fear of a malpractice suit -- 
is about the same here as it is nationwide. Limiting compensation to medical 
malpractice victims benefits only greedy insurance companies and dangerous 
doctors. Insurers were dramatically overcharging for malpractice coverage in 
the mid-1980s, until Proposition 103's rate controls began forcing premiums 
down. Still, in 1990, malpractice insurance companies paid out only 36 cents in 
claims for every premium dollar they took in. Malpractice insurers' operating 
profits in California were a staggering 40% of premiums that year.

 * With all respect to Glenn Ackerman of the Los Angeles Police Department, who 
is quoted in your Dec. 18 story regarding Heidi Fleiss, he created an 
impression that is not consistent with the facts. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD does arrest persons who wish to be customers of prostitutes.Through 
the years the Hollywood Division of LAPD has had female officers walk on Sunset 
Boulevard. When a person approaches them and solicits an act of prostitution 
nearby officers are alerted and the person is arrested. A prominent 
professional athlete can attest to the effectiveness of this ongoing campaign. 
I tried to get the media to publish or announce the names of these arrestees. 
Unanimously, the media declined. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollywood Chamber of Commerce has had an important role in the 
anti-prostitution campaign. Through the help of some of its members the chamber 
raised $18,000 to purchase a computer for the Hollywood Vice Squad that enabled 
officers to instantly identify persons arrested for prostitution. Cooperating 
with the chamber, John Cappalletti, Heisman Trophy winner and former Los 
Angeles Ram, provided the software for a program that drastically reduced 
prostitution in Hollywood.

PERSPECTIVE ON NATO; KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON RUSSIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAULA J. DOBRIANSKY, DAVID B. RIVKIN JR. and JEFFREY A. BAXTER, Paula J. 
Dobriansky, a former director of European and Soviet affairs at the National 
Security Council, is an adjunct fellow at the Hudson Institute. David B. Rivkin 
Jr. held several policy positions in the Reagan and Bush administrations; he is 
an adjunct fellow at the American Enterprise Institute. Jeffrey A. Baxter is a 
California-based defense analyst. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Contrary to assertions by numerous defense experts, the quandary confronting 
NATO's leaders today is not how to change its strategic orientation and thus 
avoid a continued drift into obsolescence. It is the underlying conflict 
between seeing Russia as a potential security partner or a security threat. 
Unfortunately, imprudently, the former is what the Clinton Administration 
envisions with the accommodationist policy it is bringing to this week's NATO 
summit: Invite the new East European democracies to join a "partnership for 
peace" that will neither offend Moscow nor answer their security worries. In 
fact, denying full NATO support to the most vulnerable of the former Soviet 
satellites is more likely to encourage Russia's re-emerging imperial 
tendencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent developments in Russia ought to reinforce the heretofore minority view 
among Western analysts that NATO's traditional missions -- deterrence, defense 
and reassurance against a potential threat from the East -- are as valid as 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems festering in Russia are not simply economic, amenable to "reform" 
of the Yeltsin program and an infusion of Western aid. The popular discontent 
and its manifestations remind many of Weimar Germany in the early 1930s: an 
authoritarian and imperialistic populace that has become impatient with 
economic privation, cynical about its government at all levels, disoriented by 
tumultuous political change and, with the exception of a small stratum of 
intellectuals, rather uninspired by democratic ideals. In short, a populace 
ready for a radical leader to rise up and set things right. 
</P>
<P>
 While everybody is focusing on the size of Vladimir Zhirinovsky's following -- 
and it is troubling -- nobody seems bothered by other menacing signs from 
Russia itself: Moscow has asserted a "Monroe doctrine" in Eastern Europe and 
the former Soviet Union and enunciated an aggressive general military doctrine; 
it has failed to withdraw troops from the Baltics; it has been trying to 
destabilize Ukraine, and in such areas as Moldova, Georgia and Azerbaijan its 
forces have been both provoking conflicts and fighting therein. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this should give pause to those who cannot see the fine line between 
encouraging democracy in Russia and placating Moscow. It is strategically 
myopic to try to ensure Western security by perpetuating a security vacuum in 
Eastern Europe. In fact, keeping such countries as Poland out of NATO invites 
precisely the problem the West is trying to avoid: encouraging Russia to meddle 
in Eastern European affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the vague multilateralism of the Clinton Administration's 
"partnership for peace," which seems to treat all Central and East European 
countries as equally worthy candidates for a security guarantee, NATO's best 
course now is to offer membership at least to Poland, Hungary and the Czech 
Republic. It is specious to argue that such an extension of NATO's boundaries 
eastward would push Russia onto an anti-Western course. To believe that is to 
put far too much stock in Zhirinovsky's imperialist bluster. As Henry Kissinger 
has aptly noted, "We resisted blackmail when Russia was strong. Does it make 
sense to permit Moscow to blackmail us now with its domestic weakness?" 
</P>
<P>
 Enlarging NATO's membership need not be provocative. It does not have to 
include full partnership in NATO's unified military structure, although NATO's 
forward defense guarantee should extend to the new members. It is the political 
and strategic symbolism that is important. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary threat to security in the East is not a Russian military invasion 
of Ukraine or Poland. Rather, if the Russian empire is to be re-established it 
will be through a combination of economic pressure and subversion, abetted by 
the target states' sense of being abandoned by the West.  
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, NATO's most important function in the years ahead is a combination of 
deterrence and reassurance. A new cordon sanitaire in the East would cause no 
ascertainable harm and would be immensely valuable if Russia were to show signs 
of preferring its old ways to the hard work of institutionalizing democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, tinkering with NATO membership is not enough. We also need to 
arrest the decline in NATO's military capabilities and particularly to stop the 
erosion of its nuclear component. Given the post-Cold War geopolitical changes 
and the precipitous decline of Russia's conventional military capabilities, 
NATO can afford to get rid of all short-range and battlefield nuclear systems. 
Arguably, for the foreseeable future, NATO's nuclear assets need not do more 
than prevent nuclear intimidation by Russia (or some unforeseen other power), a 
task that can be performed by a relatively small force of nuclear-armed 
aircraft, augmented by a modest theater-ballistic missile defense capability. 
For the time being, the quality of NATO's statecraft and the fact of its 
cohesion are the most important guarantors of Euorpean security. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, even these modest goals for NATO are not easy tasks in a time of 
economic belt-tightening, uncertain political leadership and public distaste 
for a muscular foreign policy. They will be made particularly difficult by 
timid arguments for accommodating Moscow at all costs, and by the widening gulf 
in European and American thinking about Western security issues. The 
alternatives, however, are quite bleak. It would be ironic in the extreme if, 
while the Soviet Union lost the Cold War, NATO were to lose the post-Cold War 
peace.

COMMUNITY POLICING IS A TWO-WAY STREET; LAPD: A PARTNERSHIP HAS TO BE BUILT 
ACROSS A WIDE BREACH -- AND NOT JUST WITH FRIENDLY CITIZENS OR BY CULTIVATING 
SNITCHES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOE DOMANICK, Joe Domanick is writing a book about the Los Angeles Police 
Department. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark Kroeker, LAPD deputy chief, last Wednesday announced department plans to 
implement community policing where it matters most -- in South-Central Los 
Angeles. Thirty experienced officers, Kroeker said, would work with community 
representatives to try to solve the area's crime problems. Let's hope it's as 
promising as it sounds, and not more of the same in a different guise. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20 years ago, the LAPD tried something similar called the Basic Car 
Plan. Ed Davis, then chief, wanted to provide good police service, too. Davis 
was bombastic enough to be dubbed "Crazy Ed" by his critics, but he was 
extremely smart, and understood, 20 years before it would again become 
fashionable, the importance of community policing. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis knew that impersonal, faceless police officers in patrol cars, without 
roots or ties or personal relationships in a community, were an ineffective 
method of policing that made the officer an alien among the people he was 
supposed to be serving. So he began the Basic Car Plan, assigning officers to 
specific geographic locations and instructing them to meet with advisory 
committees made up of representatives of the neighborhood they were policing -- 
essentially the plan that Kroeker is now proposing. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers were to find out people's concerns about crime and then address 
them. The concept was inspired, and had its spirit been fully implemented, it 
might have led to an astounding turnabout in the LAPD; the fires of April, 
1992, might have never been ignited. 
</P>
<P>
 But the crucial step of addressing the lethal problems between the LAPD and 
the young men of the black and Chicano communities was never taken. Of course 
those communities were concerned with crime, were in fact obsessed with crime, 
and any moves by the LAPD to fight it more effectively were welcome. But of 
equal if not greater obsession to the people of areas like South-Central was 
the whole issue of police shootings, police brutality and police harassment, 
which many of the LAPD officers involved with the program went out of their way 
to avoid addressing at the meetings. The "code of silence," the "brotherhood in 
blue," discouraged that. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the meetings were attended by those already friendly to the 
department; those who weren't stayed home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We told them what we wanted, rather than finding out what they wanted," said 
David Dotson, former assistant chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Being unwilling to take that extra step and truly deal with those issues would 
come back to haunt the LAPD. Crime prevention is only one element of community 
policing; equally important is being responsive to legitimate community 
complaints about brutality and harassment. Was that not, after all, what the 
Christopher Commission report was all about? 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the line between assisting the police in catching criminals and 
informing on your neighbor is a fine one. Nurturing relationships and 
developing trust so that the community willingly cooperates in an investigation 
of the latest drive-by shooting is the essence of policing -- as opposed to 
developing a community of snitches, a nightmarish specter in a free society. 
And it was snitches that some of the officers during the community meetings 
were asking the residents to become. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the "major tests" that Kroeker laid out for the department's plan is 
whether it produces "a drop in the number of murders in South Bureau next 
year." It's a laudable, ambitious goal. It would have been even more comforting 
had the area's councilman, Mark Ridley-Thomas, been included in the planning. 
Community policing has to be "a partnership between the community and the 
police, and that's yet to happen," Ridley-Thomas said after Kroeker's 
announcement. "There's far too little attention given to that." 
</P>
<P>
 It would also have been better had Kroeker announced unequivocally that, along 
with lowering the murder rate, his second major and equally important goal was 
to reduce the decades-long hatred between the LAPD and the young men of 
South-Central, and not just to work with merchants and the middle class. Let's 
hope that Kroeker and Chief Willie Williams understand that rather than repeat 
the mistakes of the past.

COLUMN RIGHT: WHAT BILL SHOULD SAY TO BORIS; A BAND OF ECONOMISTS WANT TO HEAD 
OFF THE RECOVERY BEFORE IT HITS ITS STRIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN FELDSTEIN KATHLEEN FELDSTEIN, Martin Feldstein is a former chairman

<TEXT>
<P>
 The pain that Russia's economic reform inflicts on its average citizen was 
clearly reflected in the recent election in which right-wing and anti-reform 
parties gained at the expense of President Boris N. Yeltsin's followers and of 
economic reformers in general. Not surprisingly, Yeltsin has responded by 
saying that he will slow the pace of reform and do more to raise the Russian 
standard of living.  
</P>
<P>
 While saying that may be good politics for Yeltsin, actually slowing the pace 
of reform would be bad economics. Russia was on the right track before the 
election and should not abandon its progress in developing a market economy. 
That is the message that President Clinton should bring to Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, that is not the message that senior U.S. officials have been 
sending in recent weeks. When Vice President Gore was in Moscow, he criticized 
the International Monetary Fund's support of rapid privatization and tough 
anti-inflationary policy. And Strobe Talbott, now the second in command in the 
State Department, recently quipped that the Russians need a policy with less 
shock and more therapy.  
</P>
<P>
 Because the dissatisfaction of the Russian people and the inequities that have 
developed in their private sector have been well publicized, it is easy to 
overlook the real progress toward a market economy over the past year. In fact, 
two key reforms have been introduced.  
</P>
<P>
 First, there has been significant progress in privatizing existing enterprises 
and in allowing new private enterprises. More than a third of all Russian 
employees now work for firms that have in some sense been privatized. Second, 
most prices have been decontrolled, allowing supply and demand to determine 
them. This has eliminated artificial scarcity, bringing consumer goods back to 
store shelves.  
</P>
<P>
 Only such fundamental economic reform can raise the Russian standard of living 
to that of the major Western countries. Now, Russia's per-capita income is less 
than half that in the countries of Western Europe.  
</P>
<P>
 Seventy-five years of communism have left a mis-structured economy that 
resists change. Under the communist system, economic decisions were based on 
the wrong prices and incentives. Managers and workers now continue to work with 
antiquated plants and equipment. Many find it difficult to give up old habits 
best summed up by a worker's comment that under communism, "They pretended to 
pay us and we pretended to work."  
</P>
<P>
 Even in eastern Germany, the most efficient of the communist economies, moving 
to a market economy has meant firing two out of three workers in newly 
privatized industrial companies. It is inevitable that there will be further 
job losses and income reductions in Russia until resources have been redeployed 
more productively in response to market prices.  
</P>
<P>
 Further pain will also be necessary to bring down the high rate of inflation. 
Until now, Yeltsin has been unable to force the Russian Central Bank to stop 
its inflationary policies. Instead of limiting credit, it has continued to lend 
to bankrupt corporations to bail out managements.  
</P>
<P>
 The slower pace of reform that Yeltsin has spoken of would not make it any 
easier or less painful to achieve a market economy. Experience in other former 
communist countries shows the benefit of not delaying reform. Although Poland 
and the Baltic countries suffered substantially during the first years of 
reform, they are now enjoying a general recovery with increasing prosperity. In 
contrast, Ukraine and Romania, where reform has been delayed, are experiencing 
painfully chaotic conditions.  
</P>
<P>
 The political costs of a prolonged restructuring could well prove to be higher 
than the costs of a quick though severe one. Extending the timetable might only 
increase the political opposition to reform. Economics and politics both 
conclude that the sooner and quicker, the better.  
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the pain of correcting the errors of 75 years cannot be 
significantly reduced by foreign aid, even if the United States and other 
Western governments made very generous gifts. Since Russia has a population of 
more than 250 million people, each $1 billion of aid adds less than $4 to 
per-capita income in a country where average income is now about $7,000. Even 
the very implausible $25 billion of aid that some have advocated would raise 
Russian incomes by less than 2%.  
</P>
<P>
 In the end, there is little the West can or should do to affect Russian 
economic reform. The decision of what to do and how fast to move must be left 
to the Russian government. But Clinton should be clear that there is no viable 
alternative to a market economy and that rapid reform is more likely to 
succeed.

A CONSTRUCTIVE METHOD OF FIGHTING HATE; * MEETING HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS MIGHT BE 
BETTER LESSON THAN JAIL FOR RACIST SKINHEADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last month's remarkable meeting between two Holocaust survivors and members of 
the Fourth Reich Skinheads, a group of self-described racists, was part of a 
unique and hopeful effort to force members of hate groups to confront their 
anger. The arrests of the skinheads last summer shocked the region with such 
allegations as machine-gun peddling to white supremacists out of a quiet Costa 
Mesa neighborhood, and planned attacks on African Americans, Jews and houses of 
worship. 
</P>
<P>
 The sessions were part of a counseling program designed by Assistant U.S. 
Atty. Marc R. Greenberg, who had negotiated guilty pleas with two members 
charged with carrying out bombings and plotting an attack on the First African 
Methodist Episcopal Church in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 For three days in late December, a group of the skinheads who pleaded guilty 
and others who were not charged heard from Holocaust survivors, went to a jail, 
met a federal judge and, in Orange County, talked about diversity with a group 
of students from the American Jewish Committee's Hands Across the Campus 
program at Chapman University. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg put together a program that he hoped would have a more constructive 
impact on the young skinheads than merely sending the guilty to jail and 
leaving the others to draw whatever conclusions they might from the prosecution 
of their friends. With the help of a committee of volunteers, a program was put 
together aimed at addressing underlying causes of racism. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all were moved by their experience, but some apparently were. Nearly half 
the group said they would like to return to work again with the counselors. 
Others said they would do anything to avoid jail. Some remained unrepentant. 
</P>
<P>
 The encounters were an effort to confront ignorance. If the young people 
learned something, or gained insight that might change their ways or keep them 
out of trouble, well and good. As Rabbi Marvin Hier, dean of the Wiesenthal 
Center, said, "History is full of examples of people who changed the directions 
of their lives. It's worth a shot."

FOSTERING DIVERSITY, FORESTALLING DIVISION; * EFFORTS OF ORANGE COUNTY TOGETHER 
DESERVE SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How well is Orange County doing in adapting to changes in its ethnic and 
social makeup? A recent series of articles in the Times Orange County Edition 
explored this complicated question. The bottom line seems to be that we are 
making some laudable efforts to address our increasingly diverse society, but 
we still have much room for progress. 
</P>
<P>
 That we are changing is now accepted fact. One in four residents is now Latino 
and about 10% are of Asian descent. These demographic changes in recent years 
have resulted in some painful adjustment away from old stereotypes, and in 
tensions between ethnic groups. A Times Poll last summer found that a full 52% 
of respondents thought race relations were either "poor" or "not so good" in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet the challenges, a number of initiatives have been undertaken already. 
Perhaps the greatest wake-up call was the L.A. riots in 1992, which prompted 
county opinion leaders to mobilize a nonprofit group called Orange County 
Together. It was a wisely conceived effort to address problems that might be 
awaiting Orange County if they were not considered sooner rather than when it 
might be too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the changes that have resulted are small, such as chats between 
various ethnic groups or exploring different cuisines. These are useful and 
even fun, but relatively easy; more substantive efforts aimed at positioning 
the county to deal with its diversity for the long term have already resulted 
in some controversy. Two members of Orange County Together quit last year 
because they did not agree with all the group's goals on promoting cultural 
diversity, on proposed educational programs or on the use of bilingual 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
 While not every initiative will be agreeable to all, broad attempts to deal 
with cultural diversity are crucial to the county's future and deserve support. 
For example, efforts to improve community policing and to hire a diverse work 
force in business and government are highly laudable goals. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of important interest groups, such as United Way, the Irvine 
Foundation and Southern California Edison Co., clearly have recognized that the 
efforts are important and provided funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the polling suggested that great progress can be made if people simply 
make the effort to get to know one another better. For example, white residents 
with Latino friends were more likely than other whites to say that Latinos made 
positive contributions to the county, and the same was true of Asians. 
</P>
<P>
 Friendship, beyond mere contact in the workplace or at school, seems to 
eliminate prejudice and foster broader understanding of ethnic groups. This may 
seem self-evident, but it provides reason for optimism that bringing people 
into closer contact can reap benefits for the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Together aims to anticipate Balkanization and try to head it 
off. A Garden Grove commercial strip that has more than 900 ethnically diverse 
businesses was targeted by a social agency working with Orange County Together 
for a project aimed at forging links between ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the poll found a hardening of views among older people that suggests 
the value of concentrating efforts at fostering understanding among young 
people. The work already being done to eliminate conflicts in Fountain Valley, 
Westminister, San Clemente and Huntington Beach represents a significant start. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this work is important as Orange County copes with its new diversity. 
It deserves the community's enthusiastic support.

 * Thank you for Bill Mitchell's column ("Trial Illustrates Need for Campaign 
Reform," Dec. 17).It was instructive and illuminating, and an excellent 
follow-up to the news articles and your own editorials on the subject of 
campaign finance reform. 
</P>
<P>
 When the public finally realizes how much taxpayer money is wasted by a 
legislative system that cannot break the gridlock created by all the lobbyists' 
money, public financing of all campaigns will be an obvious bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 The best government money can buy is simply too expensive for us to afford 
anymore.

DRUG LEGALIZATION IS VALID OPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Regarding your editorial comments on legalization of drugs ("Legalization, 
No; Policy Overhaul, Yes" Jan. 4): Your solid stand against drug legalization 
is remarkable considering the number of commentaries that have appeared in The 
Times since Judge (James P.) Gray initially proposed legalization several years 
ago. I had hoped you would have been more convinced by the logical arguments 
that have been presented in favor of legalization. 
</P>
<P>
 It is incredible that our society has not learned the lessons of Prohibition 
and continues to repeat that failure of history. We can only educate people to 
the dangers of drugs, we will never be able to dictate personal behavior, even 
when it is self-destructive. 
</P>
<P>
 Our prisons will continue to be a growth industry as long as the immense 
profits of the drug trade are available to anyone willing to take the risks 
involved. We will also continue to pour billions of dollars into the criminal 
justice system to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 How many more years must society endure the terrible costs of this fruitless 
"war on drugs"? 
</P>
<P>
 STEPHEN B. WHEELER 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * Your editorial: "Legalization, No; Policy Overhaul, Yes" (Jan. 4) for the 
second time presents the same illogical position. Since you advocate study of 
anti-drug policies (long overdue), how can you, prior to the study, reject one 
possible best solution -- legalization? If you already know the result of such 
a study, why not publish all your data so we can all be similarly clued in? 
</P>
<P>
 According to Judge Gray, as much as 80% of all crime is drug-related or 
-motivated. Thus, I can see how (Los Angeles County) Sheriff (Sherman) Block 
would be so vehemently opposed to drug legalization, for if it indeed 
eliminated 80% of all crime, his department would be mostly out of work. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe then the law enforcement personnel could spend their time helping 
improve our quality of life, like using their invaluable experience to teach 
kids not to abuse drugs, how to drive safely, and how to avoid trouble.

 * I am appalled that anyone or any association would even consider the least 
bit of retribution against a person who so greatly assisted in saving the lives 
of six people as did Richard Wright ("Scout Fined for Using CB in Boat Rescue," 
Jan. 5). I find it unbelievable that any association could be so self-centered 
as to prohibit a response to a distress call from a family in peril. 
</P>
<P>
 Are television reception and cellular phone connections that important that 
they no longer consider the value of human life? Is this the value system that 
the members of the Moulton Parkway Assn. teach their children? 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Wright should be commended for his initiative, knowledge and skill, not 
fined by a bunch of self-serving couch potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder what the association's reaction would have been if it had been one of 
them in that boat?

RAMS, ANGELS SHOULD LEAVE TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In reference to the complaints and lack of press and civic support for 
Orange County's only major league sports teams, the L.A. Rams and California 
Angels, I have a suggestion for Georgia (Frontiere) and (Gene) Autry: Move both 
teams back to the major leagues of the city and county of Los Angeles. They 
would then be able to call themselves the Los Angeles Rams and the Los Angeles 
Angels.Leave Anaheim to Disneyland and the minor league Ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Los Angeles could revitalize itself by erecting a new stadium in 
South Central Los Angeles. This money would come from the feds, the state and 
Los Angeles, who are supposed to finance and rebuild South L.A.  
</P>
<P>
 The Coliseum and the Rose Bowl were built in the '20s. Dodger Stadium 
(privately owned) was built in the '60s. This city is way overdue for a new 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Please rehire (Peter) Ueberroth to get this project going. The Angels and Rams 
will never progress remaining in the minor league territory of Anaheim and 
Orange County.

HERE'S A SALUTE TO CALIFORNIA LIFEGUARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * My sunburn-sensitive skin really gets chapped once again when our local 
government officials and press exclude their lifeguards for appreciation after 
natural disasters such as the recent California wildfires. 
</P>
<P>
 Our beach communities need to think and remember: police, fire and lifeguards! 
</P>
<P>
 My hat is off to all the fire departments, police and public safety men and 
women who courageously put their lives on the line to protect life and property 
during the fires. The mutual aid effort was an incredible logistic challenge 
tapping all available resources. 
</P>
<P>
 During the early stages of the fires the Los Angeles County lifeguards were 
quickly called upon to assist the fire departments with massive home 
evacuations. The same was true for the Laguna Beach lifeguards, although a much 
smaller department. So small in fact, Laguna Beach immediately had no 
lifeguards to patrol their beaches.  
</P>
<P>
 The Huntington Beach marine safety division chose to assist the Laguna 
lifeguards with mutual aid to fill the void and guard their beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The point I wanted to make was succinctly made in 1991 by Chief Edward Ekers 
of the Santa Cruz Fire Department after the "Great Quake": The beach 
communities which employ professional lifeguard services have an invaluable 
additional resource when dealing with major natural disasters. Unfortunately, 
non-beach communities are unable to realize this benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to thank all the professional lifeguards who helped out during 
the recent California wildfires. I hope their local officials and communities 
do the same.

WATER DISTRICT DECRIES SCANDAL LINK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "Study on Merging 4 Water Districts OKd" (Jan. 5): Tri-Cities Municipal 
Water District is greatly concerned over some of the information contained in 
the article. Quite candidly, we also cannot help but be somewhat offended by 
the inferences contained therein. 
</P>
<P>
 Our major point of concern is the linkage in the article between the financial 
scandals which occurred at the Santa Margarita Water District, and the four 
wholesale water districts which will apparently be the subject of the Grand 
Jury study. The wrongdoings of officials at the Santa Margarita Water District 
had nothing to do with the operations of the four wholesale water districts in 
the county. The linkage of wrongdoing from one agency to the next, without any 
factual justification for such, is unethical. How can one logically or 
legitimately justify the use of taxpayer funds for a consolidation study of 
four wholesale water districts on the basis of wrongdoing at one unrelated 
retail water district? There must be some other motivation and the voters 
deserve to know what it is. 
</P>
<P>
 Our second concern is that while the article referenced a grand jury study of 
water districts conducted in 1982, it failed to reference two follow-up studies 
which concluded that consolidation was not warranted. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be that in the ensuing 10 years, circumstances have changed such that 
it makes sense to take another look at the potential benefits of consolidation. 
As one of the districts to be included in this year's study, Tri-Cities will of 
course cooperate fully in providing all requested information and in raising 
the issues we perceive to be relevant to such a review. 
</P>
<P>
 Tri-Cities is a unique, multi-county district which provides both wholesale 
and retail water delivery services to its customers. Tri-Cities supports 
efficient, accountable government. We just think that as this process unfolds, 
each district should stand individually accountable and that your readers are 
entitled to a full understanding of the circumstances under which 
taxpayer-funded studies of this nature are being conducted.

IF NOT IN OUR COMMUNITIES, WHERE?; * EL MODENA SHELTER FOR THE MENTALLY ILL 
HOMELESS IS A SMALL BUT IMPORTANT STEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last week's groundbreaking for Orange County's first shelter for mentally ill 
homeless people was welcome, and overdue. Amazingly, the facility will be the 
county's first for the mentally ill homeless. And it is the result of seven 
years of battling for a site and money. 
</P>
<P>
 A report by the Homeless Issues Task Force last year estimated the number of 
homeless in the county at 12,000, an increase of 20% in just two years. The 
county must do more to help them, and certainly needs to provide more 
assistance to the homeless who are also mentally ill; that group may account 
for as much as 40% of all homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's first building to shelter the mentally ill homeless is on Drew 
Way in El Modena, an unincorporated area that is surrounded by the city of 
Orange. Renovations on the building started last month; when fixed up and given 
an addition, it will house 12 people dormitory-style in its three bedrooms and 
will also have room for a live-in staff person. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Mental Health Services will screen and select the shelter 
residents, who suffer from various mental disabilities. The Episcopal Services 
Alliance will operate the facility, which also has benefited from donations 
from private companies. The project is a worthwhile partnership among 
government, a nonprofit agency and the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the highest hurdles faced by backers of the facility was strong 
opposition from neighbors. The county Planning Commission recommended against 
turning the building into a shelter, and community opposition forced the 
project sponsors to cut the number of beds from 19 to 12. The Board of 
Supervisors fortunately reversed the Planning Commission recommendation and 
approved the building, which will be called Beacon House, after imposing strict 
conditions on admissions and operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Beacon House is intended to help those with relatively minor mental 
disabilities learn how to function in the outside world. Giving the homeless 
medication to mitigate the effects of their illness and helping them develop 
skills are actions aimed at helping them re-enter society and lead what one 
mental health advocate called "a pretty normal life." 
</P>
<P>
 The county's mental health groups deserve credit for backing the Episcopal 
Service Alliance in its lengthy struggle for Beacon House. Mental health 
advocates said the groundbreaking sent a message to the community that society 
must make room for the mentally ill homeless. They are right. It's a message 
that must be transmitted widely, and heeded.

 Every new year brings with it hope for meeting new goals, the desire to bring

 In this regard, 1994 will bring a special challenge around the globe. The 
United Nations has proclaimed it International Year of the Family. The theme of 
the year is "Family: Resources and Responsibilities in a Changing World." The 
motto is "Building the Smallest Democracy at the Heart of Society." The 
underlying principles of the proclamation are: The family constitutes the basic 
unit of society and therefore warrants special attention. The United Nations 
recognizes that the family as an institution is the single most important means 
of perpetuating values nurturing individuals, building self-esteem and 
providing stability in any society. 
</P>
<P>
 If we accept the premise that secure families determine the degree of 
society's security, we in Orange County have serious problems. The concern I 
hear over and over is the fear and insecurity people feel, in their homes and 
in their communities. There are crime, drugs, gangs and violence. We have 
children shooting children, children becoming parents, children abandoned 
before they have a name. 
</P>
<P>
 Hate crimes and multiethnic tensions are impacting families and individuals 
across all sectors of our society. 
</P>
<P>
 Families cannot rely totally on law enforcement or the legal system to solve 
the problems of violence. These problems have roots within social forces, but 
it is within the family that they are exaggerated or softened and contained. 
</P>
<P>
 It is within the family that we should receive the basic training for skills 
that will help us live in a larger "family" -- our community. We need to learn 
to share, to develop a sense of responsibility, to have tenderness and 
compassion for others, to be tolerant and accepting of individual differences 
and to be honest. When we fail to learn these values as individuals, the 
consequence will permeate our society, including political and social policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The values that we uphold today of competition, individualism, aggressiveness 
and materialism, if not tempered, are guaranteed to bring disappointment and a 
sense of chronic emptiness. I believe we need to balance competition with 
cooperation, individualism with individuation, assertiveness with empathy, and 
materialism with sustainable economics. 
</P>
<P>
 When I read or hear the outcries about the eroding values in our society, I am 
reminded of what Aristotle taught 2,300 years ago. For an individual to achieve 
happiness in life and to live in harmony with his society, one must build one's 
character on three values: to be temperate, that is, to curb our desire for 
excess and extremes; to have courage and face our fears and the challenge to do 
what is right; and to be just toward others. Christianity, 300 years later, 
added another value: to love one another. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no easy answers to the problems facing families today. However, I 
believe that a strong and healthy family will generate strong, healthy adults 
who will be better able to approach the increasingly difficult social and 
economic problems we face in creative and optimistic ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Henryk Sokolski, who was named international coordinator for the year, said: 
"Global concern for the family is not born of a nostalgic desire for simpler 
times, when rules and roles were less clouded by ambiguity, and the future less 
uncertain. Indeed, the so-called uncomplicated world of yesterday was in many 
ways not the sort of society we want to live in tomorrow; notably, for example, 
in respect to the subjugation of women, the reprehensible exploitation of 
children, or the neglect of the elderly and persons with disabilities. On the 
contrary, the concerns which stimulated the International Year of the Family 
are very much a reflection of intensely contemporary issues, with real and 
substantial implications for the future." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. General Assembly, in proclaiming the Year of the Family, agreed that 
activities for the year should be at the local and regional level. In 
compliance with that declaration, the Orange County Committee for the U.N. 
International Year of the Family was formed. The committee comprises 
knowledgeable and diverse people whose common goal and commitment are to build 
strength and integrity in all families within the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee is planning a number of activities throughout the year, 
including a week of family focus in schools and religious institutions, and a 
conference on health care and parenting. Every Orange County city has been 
invited to participate in living room dialogues (small multicultural, 
multiracial discussion groups aimed at further understanding of one another). 
</P>
<P>
 There is increasing awareness that government cannot be relied on to solve all 
the problems of society. The goal for the year is to support families, to 
promote the inherent strengths of families, to build a family-friendly 
community, and to help families find creative solutions to problems within each 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Families can make a difference. Little can be accomplished in isolation, but 
with combined efforts, much can be done. However, there needs to be increased 
cooperation among government, businesses and volunteer grass-roots 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 I am impressed by the large numbers of groups and citizens who have been 
working diligently, although independently, to solve problems in creative ways. 
Hopefully, we can make this a year in which we pull our resources together, 
share our creativity and energy, and let each other know about solutions to 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 When I hear expressions of discouragement about the difficult task ahead, I am 
reminded of other "idealistic" efforts. It has been 30 years since the U.S. 
surgeon general warned against the dangers of smoking, since President John F. 
Kennedy promoted physical fitness. Little happened at first. The seed was 
planted long before it flourished; but it did flourish!

BUNKER GRAFFITI AND BOLSA CHICA; CHICA PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Before the demolition of one of Orange County's most historical sites, 
shouldn't the public get to view them? 
</P>
<P>
 The 50-year-old bunkers, located in Huntington Beach at Warner and Pacific 
Coast Highway have been buried for over half a century and now they are being 
destroyed so the land can be used for development. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people are fascinated with these enormous sites that contain jail cells, 
overhead tunnels, underground tunnels, generator rooms, shower rooms and more. 
</P>
<P>
 This graffiti is from the teens of the '90s! And it all has some meaning. The 
demolition of these bunkers should be stopped until the public has a chance to 
view them. What can the public hurt now? They are going to be destroyed anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 DANNY NORMANDIN 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * Odd that graffiti taking place in an unused war relic is referred to in 
terms like "archeological treasure," "social preoccupation" and even called 
"art."  
</P>
<P>
 The same kind of artwork was produced in abundance just a couple of miles down 
the road, on the beach, in full view, and you didn't have to break the law to 
get in. The colorful retaining walls of Huntington Beach (north of the pier) 
were part of a popular program closed earlier this year for doing exactly what 
went on in the hidden bunker. 
</P>
<P>
 In closing down the Walls on the beach, uptight locals cited what they 
considered an "undesirable element" coming down to "their" beach. But I bet it 
was this same "element" that found their way into the war/art bunker, 
transforming it into a real space of social and archeological significance.  
</P>
<P>
 Someone should direct Nancy Whitney-Desautels south to the Walls, where she 
can discover a whole new set of hieroglyphics. Then maybe some people in 
Huntington Beach will wake up and realize just how important the work was, or 
is, because it's still there.

BOLSA CHICA DEVELOPMENT PLAN WOULD RESTORE WETLANDS, IMPROVE ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Flossie Horgan's letter (Jan. 2) asks: "What is the worth of Bolsa Chica?" 
As president of the Bolsa Chica Land Trust, she hopes to persuade the Koll Real 
Estate Group to sell the property to her group, which includes many homeowners 
living adjacent to the property. 
</P>
<P>
 In existence for nearly two years, the Land Trust has reportedly raised about 
$40,000, most of which has gone into operational costs for mailing new letters 
and producing an emotional video opposing Koll's project. How much of this 
$40,000 is actually left? 
</P>
<P>
 If Koll's property is worth $1 million per acre, or even if it's worth 1/10th 
of that, the land would be worth $170 million. How many acres of ocean-front 
property can they really buy? 
</P>
<P>
 From reading her letter and the others published last Sunday, you could easily 
miss the fact that Koll has offered to donate 75% of Bolsa Chica to the public, 
restore dying wetlands and increase the amount of public open space and 
recreation -- entirely at Koll's expense. 
</P>
<P>
 You really can't blame these people for wanting the government to purchase 
Bolsa Chica so that the open space next to their homes would be preserved. 
However, I don't want my tax dollars spent on something that Koll is offering 
to the public for free. Let's have "Restoration without Taxation!" 
</P>
<P>
 ROBERT GEBAUER 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * I note with outrage that the Huntington Beach City Council approved spending 
$133,000 for outside consultants to monitor the county (environmental impact 
report) of the previously approved Bolsa Chica Coalition Plan. In a time of 
tight budgets, this spending is clearly not right. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has staff planners and attorneys being paid big-time salaries who 
could just as well do the review. What do these people do, if they are not 
qualified to support the city's administrative functions? 
</P>
<P>
 The former mayor, Grace Winchell, voted in favor of the 1989 Bolsa Chica 
Coalition Plan, yet is now acting as if the Coalition Plan is something dreamed 
up solely by the Koll Co. The Coalition Plan was drafted with input and 
agreement from the city, including council approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The county is selling the Bolsa Chica EIR for $60, and to date there have been 
150 copies purchased! That tells me that Ph.D.s and lawyers affiliated with the 
Bolsa Chica Land Trust, and Huntington Beach Tomorrow, will scrutinize it to 
death. The city does not need to spend yet more scarce taxpayer money on the 
review. 
</P>
<P>
 For $133,000 we could fund two police officers, which would be money much 
better spent. Businesses are leaving the city, the tax base is being eroded by 
declining real estate values, and this council sits idly by, avoiding a great 
chance to add to the tax base, create jobs, and create added sales tax revenue. 
 
</P>
<P>
 For the council to obstruct a financially viable plan to improve the 
environment while at the same time improving our local economy, is not in the 
best interest of the residents. I intend to hold each of (them) accountable at 
election time.

ON (SAN JOAQUIN HILLS TOLL) ROAD AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your editorial ("Have a Heart -- Build a Toll Road Bypass," Jan. 2) 
concerning the Transportation Corridor Agencies' plan to charge a toll on a 
portion of Newport Coast Drive when it becomes a part of the San Joaquin Hills 
Toll Road addresses a problem that is only the tip of the iceberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) and others are rightly upset that 
this previously free ride will soon begin to cost drivers a dollar or so per 
round trip. But what your commentary neglects to mention is the reason the TCA 
so adamantly insists the tolls be assessed: Toll revenues from Newport Coast 
Drive make up a significant portion of the monies budgeted to support the 
near-junk-level bonds issued to finance the ill-conceived San Joaquin Hills 
Toll Road project. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the Newport Coast tolls, the TCA will be unable to service the debt on 
its high-risk bonds. And who will ultimately pick up the tab when those bonds 
go into default? Not just the few motorists who pay to use the toll road, but 
every taxpayer in Orange County. Because, you see, the federal government has 
guaranteed those precarious investments with our tax dollars to the tune of 
over $1 million! 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Ferguson is to be applauded for looking out for the constituents 
in his own district, and it is commendable that The Times would like to see a 
toll-free extension of Ford Road built. But a mere bypass enabling a few folks 
to avoid the toll on Newport Coast Drive will not protect the rest of us 
taxpayers from a bailout of private speculators' toll road bond losses. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time for our other elected representatives to follow Mr. Ferguson's lead 
and act now to prevent public funds from being used to buoy up private 
investment in a risky, non-public venture. Because when the toll road goes 
broke, there won't be any bypass available for the taxpayers who'll be forced 
to foot the bill. 
</P>

 Surely others must have thought of this solution: Why not issue coded passes 
for all who drive Newport Coast Drive regularly? 
</P>
<P>
 Eligibility could be based on: point of origin -- address; frequency of use; 
destination -- job location; and other daily justifiable needs.

 Plastic or paper is cheap. Pavement is expensive.

HARDING WINS HER SECOND TITLE; FIGURE SKATING: SHE AND KERRIGAN EARN BERTHS ON 
U.S. OLYMPIC TEAM. KWAN, 13, AND ZAYAK, 28, STILL FIND JOY IN DEFEAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a remarkable night for the youngest competitor, 13-year-old Michelle 
Kwan, and the oldest, 28-year-old Elaine Zayak, but, in the end, the two female 
figure skaters the United States will send to Norway next month for the Winter 
Olympics are the ones who figured to go all along, Nancy Kerrigan and Tonya 
Harding. 
</P>
<P>
 While Kerrigan, victimized by an assault Thursday that forced her off the ice 
because of a bruised and swollen knee, waited for the waiver that would give 
her an Olympic berth, Harding had to skate for hers in the U.S. Figure Skating 
Championships at Joe Louis Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 She responded beautifully, landing all five triple jumps she attempted and 
getting first-place marks from all nine judges in Saturday night's freestyle 
program to win her second national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost before the computer registered Harding as the champion, the U.S. Figure 
Skating Assn.'s 45-member international committee took advantage of the rule 
that gives it the discretion to choose its Olympians regardless of the national 
championship results and voted unanimously that Kerrigan should be one. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kerrigan will be required to prove her fitness for three 
international judges a week or two before the Winter Olympics' Feb. 12 opening 
ceremony in Lillehammer, Norway, Mahlon Bradley, an orthopedist who treated her 
last week, said Saturday that she should be able to return to the ice within 
one week and begin jumping within two. 
</P>
<P>
 If she has healed, Kerrigan, 24, of Stoneham, Mass., will be making her second 
Olympic trip, as will Harding, 23, of Portland, Ore. Kerrigan was third in 
1992, Harding fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 If Kerrigan has not recovered, the berth will belong to a Torrance teen-ager, 
Kwan, who, one year after defying her coach by taking a test that elevated her 
to figure skating's senior level, finished second in the national 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her size, 4 feet 11 and 88 pounds, she had the most technically 
challenging freestyle program. She was not quite up to it, landing four of the 
seven triple jumps she had planned and falling once. But five of the nine 
judges gave her second-place marks, and none placed her lower than third as she 
edged Nicole Bobek, a 16-year-old from Colorado Springs, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have done better, but I'm happy with what I've done," said Kwan, who 
last month won the world junior championship in her typically understated 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Her coach, Frank Carroll, was ecstatic, saying: "We had no expectations. We 
just worked hard and all our dreams came true this year. It was a great, 
wonderful year." 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll said that he has no objection to the selection of Kerrigan instead of 
Kwan to the Olympic team. Only the second time since 1924 that the Americans 
have had fewer than three women's berths, they were restricted to two this year 
because of their failure to place a skater among the top five in the world in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nancy was skating the best I've seen her, and I think she would have won the 
competition," Carroll said. 
</P>
<P>
 While on the subject of dreams coming true, Zayak was operating a failing 
delicatessen in Paramus, N.J., and earning even less money as an also-ran in 
professional skating competitions when she decided last year to take advantage 
of an International Skating Union rule that allowed her to regain her amateur 
status. 
</P>
<P>
 So, 12 years after she won the world championship, she came back to a brave 
new world, in which the most difficult jumps she landed her first time around 
were now the easiest for the modern skaters. 
</P>
<P>
 But she quickly caught up to most of the women, finishing fourth in Friday 
night's technical program, and became the crowd favorite. She got a tremendous 
ovation from the 17,228 spectators even before she started skating Saturday 
night, causing her to cry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't expect that," she said later after earning fourth place. "I thought, 
'Oh, no, what am I going to do now if I don't skate well?' " 
</P>
<P>
 No problem. She was still in tears at the end, after landing three triple 
jumps, and the crowd was on its feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate triumph, however, belonged to Harding, who battled financial 
hardships to win the 1991 championship, then threatened to throw it away off of 
the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 And she has asthma, a condition that often leaves her struggling for breath. 
</P>
<P>
 But she persevered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made it," she said later, still coughing. "I'm the Tonya Harding that 
everyone always believes in."

CARSON SENT ON THE ROAD AGAIN; HOCKEY: KINGS SEND HIM AWAY FOR SECOND TIME, 
THIS TIME TO VANCOUVER FOR WARD AND FUTURE CONSIDERATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Vancouver Canucks acquired much-traveled Jimmy Carson in a Saturday trade 
with the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 The 25-year-old center was traded for the fourth time in his career, moving to 
Vancouver for Dixon Ward and future considerations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canucks, desperate for depth at the center position, played at Toronto on 
Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors of a Carson-Ward deal have been circulating for over a month, and 
general manager Pat Quinn decided to make the transaction when it became 
apparent he was unlikely to unload free-agent holdout Petr Nedved by Monday, 
Nedved's self-imposed trade deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 But Quinn, who was Carson's first NHL coach, denied the deal was a second-best 
scenario. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just an alteration of our plans," said Quinn at an impromptu news 
conference at Maple Leaf Gardens. "It may provide some flexibility with Petr 
that will still help our hockey club." 
</P>
<P>
 Carson, who signed a three-year $3.3-million deal earlier this season, had 
four goals and seven assists for 11 points in 25 games this season and often 
didn't dress for the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 He was in King Coach Barry Melrose's doghouse during the playoffs last spring, 
and was benched for most of the Kings' march to the Stanley Cup final. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is obvious he seems to be at the end of his rope with the coach," said 
Quinn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a risk, let's face it. We don't know what has happened between Jimmy 
and his coach out there. Maybe there is something we don't know about but the 
upside for us is good. But if Jimmy comes in and performs at four goals and 11 
assists level, it is not a good gamble for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Ward, an impressive rookie last season who earns $200,000, had six goals and 
one assist for seven points in 33 games. He learned of the trade shortly before 
the Canucks played the Leafs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was working on my sticks and preparing for the game," said Ward. "I knew 
that as soon as they told me Pat wanted to see me, I was going somewhere. There 
could be worse places to go but I will miss my friends in Vancouver." 
</P>
<P>
 Carson, born in Southfield, Mich., was the second overall pick in the 1986 
entry draft when selected by Los Angeles from the Verdun juniors. 
</P>
<P>
 After 37- and 55-goal seasons with the Kings, Carson was traded to the 
Edmonton Oilers in the megadeal for Wayne Gretzky in August 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonton swapped Carson to the Detroit Red Wings in November 1989 (with Kevin 
McClelland) for Petr Klima, Joe Murphy, Adam Graves and Jeff Sharples. 
Ironically, Murphy was the player picked ahead of Carson in the draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit sent Carson back to Los Angeles last January in a six-player deal 
involving defenseman Paul Coffey. 
</P>
<P>
 In seven NHL seasons, Carson had 258 goals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canucks have never had a center with the scoring touch of Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver has not been able sign Nedved, and the Carson deal likely means 
Nedved will skate with the Canadian Olympic team at the Winter Games next month 
in Lillehammer. 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn said he has talked to a number of teams over the last couple of days but 
nothing is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward, also 25, was a late-round pick of the Canucks in 1988 from the 
University of North Dakota.

KEEP NO. 6 BRUINS UNBEATEN, 104-71.

 This was hardly fair, and Brent Barry, Oregon State forward, wore the 
frustration on his face. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most undisciplined I've seen us," Barry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Undisciplined was only part of the problem against No. 6 UCLA on Saturday as 
the Bruins ran away with a 104-71 Pacific 10 Conference victory before 8,684 at 
Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 Without two of its strongest inside players, Oregon State was no match against 
a team that is making routs routine. Injuries to 6-foot-7 Mustapha Hoff and 6-7 
Sonny Benjamin of Riverside North High have depleted the Beavers' front line. 
</P>
<P>
 "With our talent, we can't get away with (not executing)," said Barry, the son 
of former NBA star Rick Barry. 
</P>
<P>
 Against UCLA (9-0), Oregon State could not get away with much, not even with 
Barry's 18 points, including three three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing with intensity that was lacking in Thursday's victory over Oregon, 
UCLA opened a 19-7 lead against the Beavers (4-7). 
</P>
<P>
 "They took our players right out of sync," Oregon State Coach Jim Anderson 
said. "We completely panicked. From that moment on, it was a disaster for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruin point guard Tyus Edney had a career-high 22 points, along with eight 
assists and four rebounds. A junior from Long Beach Poly, Edney has struggled 
this season because of injuries. But Saturday he was playing at full strength, 
prompting Anderson to call him the conference's smartest point guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Edney's shrewdest moments involved finding UCLA's offensive threats, 
Ed O'Bannon and Shon Tarver, who scored 22 and 20, respectively. But when the 
Beavers were slow in setting up defensively, Edney burned them with easy 
layups. Edney made nine of 11 shots and all four of his free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking a 47-24 halftime lead, UCLA showed no signs of letting up in 
extending its lead to 56-28 with 17:31 to play. Ed O'Bannon was effective 
inside and out and had only one way to explain it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're having fun," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Bannon, a 6-8 junior, had the game's most spectacular play with a one-handed 
dunk off of Tarver's lob for a 74-39 lead with 11:54 left. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ridiculous," Charles O'Bannon said of his brother's effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad the whistle blew, because I couldn't have played defense after 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Tarver, the play illustrates the difference between this season's 
team and last's. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year people can read quicker," he said. "Last year, our minds were in 
motion more than our bodies." 
</P>
<P>
 Barry recalled last season's game in Westwood in which the Bruins escaped with 
a 79-73 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he has gained enormous respect for UCLA.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is a team that could make some noise," he said. "They are so athletic, 
they could win a national championship." 
</P>
<P>
 With the bulk of the Pac-10 season still to play, few in Westwood are ready to 
go that far. 
</P>
<P>
 The question is whether the Bruins are.

FOR DUCKS, NO PLACE LIKE ROAD; HOCKEY: THEY BECOME FIRST TEAM TO WIN 12 GAMES 
AWAY FROM HOME WITH 5-3 VICTORY OVER BLUES.

 The St. Louis Arena crowd raised a welcoming cheer for its old friend Guy 
Hebert on Saturday, then booed the home team as the Blues became the Mighty 
Ducks' latest road kill. 
</P>
<P>
 By beating St. Louis, 5-3, in front of a standing-room only crowd of 18,143, 
the Ducks became the first NHL team to win 12 games on the road this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks have the most victories, but the Toronto Maple Leafs have more road 
points with 25 and a 10-7-5 record. 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert made 40 saves and defenseman Bill Houlder and right wing Peter Douris 
each scored two goals as the Ducks finished their trip with a 4-2 record and a 
three-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing standing between the Ducks and a phenomenal record is a 4-12-2 
mark at Anaheim Arena. After playing 20 of their last 28 on the road, the Ducks 
are going home after a 4-2 trip to play 13 of their next 17 at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do we have to?" Coach Ron Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert was the seldom-used backup to St. Louis goalie Curtis Joseph last 
season, and he was psyched to play his old teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has a policy of starting players against the teams that let them go, 
and it works. 
</P>
<P>
 "Especially with the goaltenders," Wilson said. "They get really excited, and 
maybe the other team tries to hard to pick corners to beat the guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert already made good in his first chance against the Blues with a 2-1 
overtime victory Dec. 12 at Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was more exciting here, because this is where I called home for a couple 
of years," Hebert said. "Especially playing in front of the hometown fans -- 
the former hometown fans, I should say -- and playing against my former 
roommate and buddy." 
</P>
<P>
 For the second time, Hebert made his old buddy a loser, and this time Joseph 
was replaced by this year's backup, Jim Hrivnak, with the Blues trailing, 4-1, 
after two periods. 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert faced six power plays by a St. Louis unit led by Brett Hull. Hull had 
two power-play goals, his 27th and 28th goals of the season, but they didn't 
come until the third period, and he needed 10 shots to score them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I looked up, he had the puck again," Hebert said. Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Center Anatoli Semenov might resume playing as soon as Jan. 24, Coach Ron 
Wilson said. Semenov was the Ducks' leading scorer with nine goals and 15 
assists when he dislocated his left elbow in a collision with teammate Stu 
Grimson and Florida's Dave Lowry on Dec. 7. He was expected to be out eight 
weeks. . . . . Forward Steven King returned home Friday because of a sore back 
that kept him out of the past three games. . . . Defenseman Sean Hill was 
scratched because of a sprained left shoulder that will be examined in Anaheim 
to determine if there is a separation.

CLIPPERS LOSE FIFTH IN ROW; PRO BASKETBALL: HEAT, A TEAM GOING IN THE OTHER 
DIRECTION, BEATS THEM, 109-90, DRAWING BOOS FROM SPORTS ARENA CROWD.

<P>
 The Clippers, who made the NBA playoffs the last two seasons, are looking more 
and more like a lottery team with each game. 
</P>
<P>
 They extended their losing streak to a season-high five in a row, losing to 
the Miami Heat, 109-90, Saturday night before a booing crowd of 11,866 at the 
Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Bob Weiss held a 20-minute, closed-door team meeting after the game to 
try to get the Clippers out of their slump. It's their longest losing streak 
since they lost six in a row in November of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had some stuff we needed to talk about," Weiss said. "But it was behind 
closed doors. We put our heads down when things went a little wrong and I just 
couldn't accept it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're running out of X's and O's. We're running out of meetings. Eventually, 
we'll get out of it. . . . I think at times they don't think they can win." 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Mark Jackson is at a loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't have any answers," he said. "We've got to look at ourselves. 
The coaches have done everything they can do. We've got to stop pointing 
fingers and go out and do the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't been around a situation like this in all my years of basketball. 
We've got to step up and get the job done or else it's going to be a long year. 
It's up to us." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers (11-19), who begin a six-game, nine-day East Coast trip Tuesday 
at New York, have lost nine of their last 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one likes to lose," said Danny Manning, who scored a game-high 27 points. 
"I'm very frustrated. When you're losing, everything is wrong. You can say 
whatever you want and you can point your fingers at whoever you like. It's easy 
to do when things are bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've just got to buckle down and stay together. And that's all that needs to 
be said from my standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Harper agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just very tough times right now," he said. "I'm not here to point and 
say who ain't doing what and who ain't doing that. I think as a team we need to 
pick up our enthusiasm." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers made Miami reserve center Matt Geiger, who scored a career-high 
23 points and grabbed 10 rebounds in 27 minutes, look like an All-Star as they 
stood around on defense. Miami's bench outscored the Clipper bench, 68-16, as 
the Heat (16-13) extended its winning streak to four. Off to the best start in 
franchise history, Miami has won nine of 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 57-47, two minutes into the third quarter, the Clippers outscored 
the Heat, 13-4, to cut it to 61-60. Harper had six points in the spurt, hitting 
a free throw, a layup and a three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Clippers scored only five points in the last four minutes of the third 
quarter and trailed, 73-65, going into the final quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been concerned for quite a while," Weiss said. "They're not playing up 
to their own potential and it's our own heads that are losing the ballgames. We 
are making the mistakes." Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Ellis, who signed with the Clippers Friday, played the final 1:15. 
Ellis, the final player the Clippers waived before the season opened, averaged 
21.4 points, six rebounds and 2.9 steals for Quad Cities in the CBA.

Mexico State Coach Neil McCarthy, pleading for a few seconds to be taken off 
the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come on, you've got to take 10 seconds off," McCarthy yelled as his team's 
game at Cal State Fullerton wound its way into the final two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarthy was worried about the clock? Coach of the Big West Conference 
favorite? At Fullerton? 
</P>
<P>
 The reality check arrived a few minutes later, as New Mexico dealt the Titans 
another loss, 77-64, before 923 in Titan Gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (2-9 overall, 0-3 in the Big West) made the Aggies play at a slow 
pace and stayed within striking distance -- despite tying a school record 29 
turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans trailed by only three points with 15:34 to play, after Winston 
Peterson (14 points) got free inside; four with 11:02 remaining, when freshman 
Chris St. Clair (11 points) made his second consecutive three-point jumper; and 
five with 2:01 to play when Peterson hit a jumper off the glass.  
</P>
<P>
 But each time the Titans crept closer, they committed a turnover.  
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like the trend has been that we'll make a run at the end and then 
somehow turn the ball over," said senior guard Greg Vernon, who scored only 
three points and missed all four three-point attempts.  
</P>
<P>
 Said Titan Coach Brad Holland: "It's the little things. It's not offense and 
it's not defense. It's not screening out, or getting a rebound, or turning the 
ball over less. It's just basketball. All the little things add up." 
</P>
<P>
 James Dockery had a career-high 27 points for the Aggies (10-1, 3-0). He also 
had 10 rebounds. SCOTT MILLER

LONG BEACH STATE SURGES PAST UTAH STATE, 89-70 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With senior swingman Brian Camper academically ineligible and forward Rod 
Hannibal temporarily benched for other academic reasons, Long Beach State Coach 
Seth Greenberg relied heavily on reserves Saturday night against visiting Utah 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was two veterans who helped the 49ers score an 89-70 victory over the 
Aggies in the Big West Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior center Mike Atkinson, who leads the nation in field goal percentage, 
scored a career-high 29 points and senior guard Jeff Rogers came up with a 
half-dozen steals and nine points to spark Long Beach (6-3, 1-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Hannibal got into the game midway through the first half and finished with 12 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to make a commitment to academics," Greenberg said. "It can't just be 
lip service." 
</P>
<P>
 A reverse layup from the baseline by Atkinson tied the score at 13 with 14:16 
to go in the first half. The 6-foot-7 junior followed that 45 seconds later 
with a triple-pump jumper in the key. The score changed hands or was tied three 
times after that, then Long Beach grabbed the lead for good on a three-pointer 
by reserve forward Tim Caviezel. The basket sparked a 10-2 run that included 
another layup from Atkinson and a three-point play by Tyrone Mays. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah (5-6, 2-1) got within three, 34-31, on two free throws by Nathan Wickizer 
with 3:48 to go. But Long Beach, with Atkinson adding a three-point play, 
managed a 10-4 streak and closed the half with a three-point basket from 
Terrance O'Kelley at the buzzer. PAUL McLEOD

NORTHRIDGE BEATS IRVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Riding a wave of emotion during victories over Iowa and Cal State Fullerton, 
UC Irvine staggered to an uninspired defeat in its attempt to make it three in 
a row Saturday night. The Anteaters lost, 68-66, to Cal State Northridge (3-10) 
in front of 2,167 in Irvine's Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a game that started ugly -- it was only 2-1 after 4 1/2 minutes -- and, 
for Irvine, finished even uglier. Irvine (4-5) had a chance to tie the game in 
the final second when Joe Hannon, starting in place of injured center DeForrest 
Boyer, rebounded a miss by Zuri Williams and instead of putting it back up, 
turned and threw a pass out to the perimeter as the buzzer sounded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we were down by three instead of two," Hannon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Turnovers by both teams prevailed down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge took a 68-64 lead with 19 seconds left when Andre Chevalier made 
two free throws. Khalid Channell, the only Anteater in double figures (16 
points), put in a follow shot to cut the deficit to two points. Then Brooklyn 
McLinn, who led Northridge with 18 points, missed two free throws with eight 
seconds remaining, giving the Anteaters the chance to send the game into 
overtime. JOHN WEYLER

TROJANS FIND THE RANGE FROM 15 FEET; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: USC'S 81% FREE THROW 
SHOOTING GENERATES A 77-69 VICTORY OVER OREGON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 USC could not have picked a better time to do its best free-throw shooting of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
 In a foul-plagued game against Oregon on Saturday, the Trojans shot 81% from 
the line and made a season-high 34 free throws to defeat the Ducks, 77-69, 
before 3,574 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got very discouraging out there because you could never really get into 
the game," said USC senior Mark Boyd, had 12 points and five rebounds but was 
limited to 23 minutes because of foul trouble. "Mentally, I never got 
untracked. There were so many calls made that it almost felt like we were 
playing on the road." 
</P>
<P>
 With all-time leading scorer Harold Miner being honored before the game, the 
Trojans and Oregon combined for 53 personal fouls and 76 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 USC outrebounded the Ducks, 35-24, to improve to 2-0 in the Pacific 10 
Conference for the first time since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 With four players playing with four fouls for most of the second half, the 
Trojans (9-2) showed their depth with reserves Burt Harris, Jaha Wilson, Claude 
Green and Kirk Homenick combining for 29 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was an obvious victory and tribute to our bench," USC Coach George 
Raveling said. "In a small way, you can see why I have so much confidence in 
this team. The bench stabilized things for us." 
</P>
<P>
 After losing his starting point guard position to Damaine Powell earlier this 
season, Harris has adjusted to his new role by looking to add speed and outside 
scoring as a reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 "We now have two solid point guards, and that can only help the team," said 
Harris, who made three three-point baskets. "I try to give the team a spark by 
giving a faster look when I am on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 Another former starter who played well as a reserve was Wilson, who did not 
start for the first time in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I went in the game, Coach (Raveling) asked me to do one favor by 
playing some defense," said Wilson, a 6-foot-6 freshman who scored eight points 
and grabbed four rebounds in 15 minutes. "So, I just went out and did that and 
the offense followed." 
</P>
<P>
 Green, a freshman guard from Washington, did not play in the first half, but 
he gave the Trojans a lift as an outside scoring threat in 13 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of confidence in Claude when he comes in the game because he is 
not shy to shoot at any time," said Lorenzo Orr, who scored 12 of his team-high 
16 points in the second half with Green in the lineup. "We need to be 
aggressive on offense, and he stepped up to hit some big shots for us." 
</P>
<P>
 With Boyd and freshman center Avondre Jones struggling because of foul 
trouble, Homenick, a 7-foot sophomore, played the best game of his career with 
six points in nine minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "USC is a very aggressive team," said Coach Jerry Green, whose Ducks dropped 
to 0-2 in the Pac-10 and 4-7 overall. "They may be the most aggressive team on 
the backboards offensively of any team I've been around in a long, long time." 
</P>
<P>
 After losing fairly close games to UCLA on Thursday and USC on Saturday, 
Oregon freshman point guard Kenya Wilkens agreed with Green. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not as weak as people make us out to be because we hung in there 
against two of the top teams in our conference," said Wilkens, a former 
standout at Dorsey High. "In comparing the two teams, SC plays with more spirit 
and the way they crashed the boards really hurt us today."

COUPLES HAS A 69 TO TIE MICKELSON; PGA: BUT AT 208, THEIR LEAD IS PRECARIOUS. 
THERE ARE 13 GOLFERS WITHIN FOUR STROKES GOING INTO FINAL ROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Fred Couples and left-hander Phil Mickelson are tied for the lead after 54 
holes of the regular PGA Tour portion of the Mercedes Championships, but they 
still can't shake the old fellows. 
</P>
<P>
 Mickelson, the leader after 36 holes, birdied the last three par-fives at La 
Costa on Saturday for a 70 and a 208 total. Couples shot a bogey-free 69 to 
pull into a tie. That puts them even with Dave Stockton and Bob Murphy of the 
50-and-older group. 
</P>
<P>
 The close competition and the presence for the first time in nine years of 
Jack Nicklaus -- playing with the seniors -- enabled the event, previously 
known as the Tournament of Champions, to draw a crowd estimated at more than 
32,000. 
</P>
<P>
 It figures to be as large today because 13 golfers are within four strokes in 
the regular tour's tournament. David Edwards, who shot a six-under-par 66 on 
Saturday, is one shot behind the leaders. At 210 are Tom Kite and Ben Crenshaw. 
Jeff Maggert shot a seven-under 65, the best round of the day, to tie Jay Haas 
at 211. There are six golfers at 212, including gallery favorite Greg Norman 
and defending champion Davis Love III. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vijay Singh of Fiji, who was with the leaders through 45 holes, had a 
five-over-par 41 on the back nine to fall out of contention. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Mickelson, the 23-year-old who grew up in the San Diego area, and Couples 
say they will have to play better to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm expecting someone to break out with a big round like Maggert and Edwards 
did today," Couples said. "I really didn't think eight under would even be in 
contention. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think the reason is that everybody took a month off and, like me, 
didn't do any practicing." 
</P>
<P>
 Couples started strongly, sinking short birdie putts on the first two holes 
and parring the rest until birdieing No. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he thought he could beat the senior winner today, Couples said he 
didn't know or care. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't even think about the old guys until after the round is over," 
Couples said. "I'm just trying to win my division. It would not embarrass me if 
a senior beat me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's great they are playing so well. I know it must be a great 
motivator for (Dave) Stockton. He's been beating his own guys and now he's got 
a new goal. I doubt if he'll post the best score of all, but he could." 
</P>
<P>
 Mickelson said he wasn't playing well early but finished very well. 
</P>
<P>
 "After seven holes I was one over par," he said. "But I looked at the board 
and saw I wasn't out of it. I know I had to put up some birdies. The last three 
par-fives did the trick. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm sure of one thing -- another 70 won't win the tournament. I would 
love to get enough birdies to win this thing. It would be a great way to start 
the season, especially after not playing or practicing for a month." 
</P>
<P>
 Mickelson, who attended Arizona State, has won three tour events. One was at 
nearby Torrey Pines, and another at Tucson. Asked if he figured he was better 
on home courses, he said: 
</P>
<P>
 "Torrey Pines was home, but not Tucson. We in the Phoenix area have no love 
for Tucson."

MURPHY MAKES HIS MOVE; SENIOR GOLF: HE SHOOTS A 67 TO CATCH STOCKTON. NICKLAUS 
IS THREE BEHIND.

 The Bear went on the prowl Saturday at La Costa, but it was Bob Murphy who 
finally caught Dave Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy, who at one time suffered so from arthritis that he couldn't grip a 
club, shot a five-under-par 67 for a 54-hole total of 208 in the senior portion 
of the $1.5-million Mercedes Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Stockton, after threatening to make it a runaway, made a double bogey on the 
15th and finished with a 69 to drop into a share of the lead at eight under. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Nicklaus birdied the first two holes, but he was erratic thereafter and 
finished with a second consecutive 69 to trail the leaders by three shots at 
211. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning with the eighth hole, Nicklaus had a streak in which he didn't have 
a par for eight holes, carding five birdies and three bogeys. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy tied the course record for seniors with his 67. 
</P>
<P>
 He's thankful merely to be playing golf. A year ago his arthritis was so bad 
he feared he would never play as a senior. The drug Methotrexate has been a 
savior. Murphy has been free of pain since April, played well enough to be 
rookie of the year and is in position to open the new season with a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Stockton, after a first-round 67, was a victim of poor lies in bunkers in the 
second and third rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 He has left two shots buried under lips in sand traps and lost four shots to 
par. 
</P>
<P>
 For 12 holes Saturday, he was almost flawless. Birdie putts of eight, 12 and 
13 feet helped him go from five to 10 under par. But an impossible shot out of 
a trap on 16 and one of his few misses on a short putt gave him a double bogey. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklaus gives himself a shot at winning the senior division. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had seven birdies, I'm driving the ball well and I'm happy with the way I'm 
playing," Nicklaus said. "After working on my driving for seven or eight 
months, I'm happy with the graphite shaft. Surprisingly, it's called 'The 
Bear.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The big puzzle everyone is trying to figure out is why the seniors are keeping 
pace with the regular tour players. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the seniors are playing about as expected," Nicklaus said. "The 
regulars are not. I don't know why. I'm not going to worry about it. (Today), 
if I'm leading by two shots going to the last hole and I need a birdie for the 
best score, I'm going to make sure I win my tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 The seniors believe they have finally gained some respect this week. Now they 
would like it to show up in the prize money. 
</P>
<P>
 The regular winner will get $180,000, the senior winner $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I post the best score (today)," Stockton said with a laugh, "I'll just 
collect $280,000 and two Mercedes. Just kidding. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I do hope they don't hold separate tournaments. I like it here, and I 
think it's great to have the two groups. I do think we've earned respect. That 
and more money is all we ask. 
</P>
<P>
 "But what's likely to happen is that one of the juniors will break out with a 
rash of birdies. All I want to do is win the seniors and make sure I get 
invited back here."

SANTA ANITA; SEVEN FURLONGS IS NO PROBLEM FOR CARDMANIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trainer Derek Meredith shouldn't have been so surprised Cardmania wasn't 
favored in the $108,900 San Carlos Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 The 8-year-old son of Cox's Ridge hasn't been favored since finishing third at 
9-5 in the Phoenix Gold Cup Handicap last Feb. 21 at Turf Paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there was reason to think Cardmania could be the people's choice 
Saturday at Santa Anita. French owner Jean Couvercelle's gelding had won the 
Breeders' Cup Sprint in his most recent start two months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Favorite status went to The Wicked North, but a third consecutive victory went 
to Cardmania, who is getting better as he gets older. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had me worried (when he wasn't favored)," Meredith said after Cardmania, 
the 9-5 second choice, beat the 11-10 favorite by three-quarters of a length in 
1:21 1/5 for the seven furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of you guys deserted me. He just doesn't get any recognition. He just 
won the Breeders' Cup Sprint, and The Wicked North was favored off that one 
race (the Bing Crosby Handicap last Aug. 1) against Thirty Slews. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very confident going in. My wife (Helen, who exercises the gelding) 
told me he was very strong in his gallops." 
</P>
<P>
 More than halfway through the San Carlos, Meredith wasn't so sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eddie (Delahoussaye) almost gave me a heart attack," Meredith said. "He had 
me concerned at the head of the stretch. Turning for home, I thought he was 
beaten. Eddie said afterward, 'I'm glad you don't ride the horse.' Eddie was 
very confident." 
</P>
<P>
 Kept in the clear by Delahoussaye, Cardmania rallied four-wide into the 
stretch and outfinished The Wicked North, who was 2 1/2 lengths better than 
16-1 shot Portoferraio. Pacesetter Davy Be Good, who opened up a 1 1/2-length 
lead a furlong from the finish after a 1:08 4/5 six furlongs, faded to fourth. 
Exemplary Leader, Charts and Monde Bleu completed the order. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stayed behind The Wicked North as long as I could. Then, when I called on 
him, (Cardmania) really dug in," Delahoussaye said. "He's quite a little horse. 
I guess he loves this track better than any other. People were saying he's 
never won at seven furlongs. Well, I guess he showed them." 
</P>
<P>
 Kept sprinting since he came to the United States in 1991, Cardmania might get 
a chance around two turns in the near future. He won at a mile in France. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll look at the race on the 30th (the Palos Verdes Handicap) next, but 
we've talked about stretching him out," said Meredith. "I think he'll stretch 
out. He's got the right style of running." 
</P>
<P>
 David Bernstein, the trainer of The Wicked North, offered no excuses for his 
5-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Cardmania) ran fantastic," he said. 
</P>

 Barring a sudden reversal in the weather, the $111,800 San Gorgonio Handicap 
will be run on the turf for the first time since 1991 today. 
</P>
<P>
 Rain has forced the 1 1/8-mile race to be switched to the main track the past 
two years, with Paseana and Southern Truce winning in 1992 and 1993, 
respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Skimble, third behind Flawlessly and Toussaud in the Matriarch on Nov. 28 at 
Hollywood Park, is the 3-1 favorite in the San Gorgonio against nine rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by Juddmonte Farms and trained by Bobby Frankel, the 5-year-old Lyphard 
mare is winless in Southern California, but was second to Miatuschka in the Las 
Palmas Handicap over this course on Oct. 24. Corey Nakatani will ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Hero's Love, who finished a head behind Skimble in the Matriarch, is the 7-2 
second choice. Hero's Love will be ridden for the first time by Laffit Pincay. 
Delahoussaye, who rode her last time, begins a five-day suspension today for an 
incident last Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 From the rail out, the rest of the field in the Grade II race: Gumpher (Paul 
Atkinson, 20-1), Dior's Angel (Fernando Valenzuela, 20-1), Lyin To The Moon 
(Kent Desormeaux, 10-1), Miss Turkana (Antonio Castanon, 8-1), Market Booster 
(Chris McCarron, 4-1), Suivi (Gary Stevens, 12-1), Miatuschka (Corey Black, 
5-1) and Shooting The Moon (Chris Antley, 20-1). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ramblin Guy is the 8-5 favorite in today's $75,000 San Miguel Stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Winless since the Hollywood Juvenile last July, Ramblin Guy will be making his 
first start since finishing seventh in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile. Chris 
McCarron replaces Delahoussaye. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Heavily favored Visible Gold made the final start of her career a winning one 
when she led wire to wire in the third race Saturday. The 6-year-old Deputy 
Minister mare, owned by Trudy McCaffery and John Toffan and trained by Paco

TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS: CLINTON LEARNING TO MIX A LITTLE 'JOHN WAYNE' INTO 
LEADERSHIP STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUDY B. ROSENER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As he approaches his first anniversary in office, there will be much 
discussion of President Clinton's performance. Some analysts will look at the 
bills he signed, the taxes he raised, the programs he proposed, the 
appointments he made, the speeches he delivered. Others will look at political 
payoffs he did or did not make, promises he did or did not keep or the number 
of news conferences he did or did not hold. 
</P>
<P>
 I propose we look at his leadership style -- one that I have labeled 
"interactive." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's is the leadership model of the future. He operates well in an 
environment where hierarchy is replaced with networks, lines of authority go in 
all directions, traditional information and power relationships are in flux and 
the only certainty is uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, his exercise of leadership may well determine how Clinton's 
presidency is ultimately judged. Interestingly, the style he has chosen -- that 
of the facilitator rather than the commander -- is exactly the approach that 
management experts such as Warren Bennis, Peter Drucker, Tom Peters and others 
suggest business executives adopt. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet this new leadership style generates confusion and discomfort because it is 
inconsistent with the more familiar "John Wayne" command-and-control model. 
</P>
<P>
 That model -- the one used in past White Houses and in many large corporations 
today -- is patterned after the military and the church. Decisions are 
top-down. Power relationships are based on clear lines of authority. 
Information and expertise are assumed to belong to those who sit atop the 
organizational pyramid. 
</P>
<P>
 The traditional approach may have made sense in the past for the United States 
and its corporations; having the only gun in town freed us to act like the 
sheriff. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the diffusion of economic power, business and government leaders 
began to assess the prevailing management model. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand, command-and-control leaders -- think of President Ronald 
Reagan or former Chrysler CEO Lee A. Iacocca -- communicate a sense of 
security. They tend to be motivated by a well-articulated philosophy or 
ideology that frames their decisions. Their actions telegraph that they are in 
control. They see work and family as separate spheres -- consistent with their 
tendency to compartmentalize issues, tasks and responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The downside to this style is its inflexibility. It rewards compliance rather 
than innovation and risk taking. It devalues and underutilizes people who don't 
look, think and act like those at the top. It assumes that the future, for the 
most part, can be approached with leadership tools of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Interactive leaders, on the other hand, communicate a sense of compassion and 
caring rather than control. They are comfortable with ambiguity. 
</P>
<P>
 They believe that process and outcome are inexorably linked. They acknowledge 
that participatory management is time-consuming and messy, but think the 
resulting decisions will be better. They feel that work and family are not 
mutually exclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 The shortcoming of such leaders is the confusion and lack of direction they 
convey. There is a sense that interactive leaders are not in control, that they 
ask questions because they lack knowledge, conviction or self-confidence, that 
they want too much to be loved. For this reason, interactive leaders are 
perceived to be weak. 
</P>
<P>
 On its own, neither model is perfect; most of us would like our leaders to be 
compassionate and decisive. And hardly anyone is solely one kind of leader or 
the other. 
</P>
<P>
 While few business leaders would classify themselves as interactive, some -- 
such as General Electric CEO Jack Welch -- profess to be moving in that 
direction. Clinton, on the other hand, clearly belongs at the interactive end 
of the spectrum. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That explains a good part of the discomfort with his leadership. But it also 
explains his accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton did not veto a single bill in his first year -- yet major, 
controversial legislation was passed. Important initiatives were launched in 
the areas of trade relations, budget cutting, health reform, criminal justice, 
environmental protection, defense conversion, workplace benefits and public 
service. And large numbers of Americans were included in the development of 
policy positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Admittedly, much of this has not been recognized amid the Administration's 
occasional misjudgments, poor decisions and confusing statements. And some of 
the discomfort with Clinton's style stems from the nature of his relationship 
with his wife: Their marriage is non-hierarchical, and the First Lady has a 
more traditional management style. 
</P>
<P>
 But the President shows signs of learning the value of melding interactive and 
command-and-control leadership skills. He has learned the hard way that there 
are times to consult -- and times to act. 
</P>
<P>
 It is too soon to assess the success of his initiatives. But his managerial 
evolution may be worth noting for business executives who -- like the President 
-- find themselves in a rapidly changing, complex world.

MONEY TALK: CALCULATING SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q: Every year I get an "estimated benefits" statement from the Social Security 
Administration to see if they have correctly recorded my annual earnings and 
contributions. My 1993 statement shocked me. Even though my contributions to 
Social Security for the year were $150 higher than what I had paid in 1992, the 
amount I was told that I could expect to receive upon retirement was $50 per 
month less in 1993 than it was in 1992. How can this be? -- M.R . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: There is a rather simple, straightforward explanation for the difference, 
although the Social Security Administration didn't bother to openly share it 
with taxpayers. Fortunately, it doesn't portend lower benefits upon retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's what happened: Sometime in the middle of 1993, the Social Security 
Administration decided to begin expressing taxpayers' estimated retirement 
benefits in terms of current dollars. Until then, the agency had been adjusting 
the benefits by an estimated inflation rate -- 1% was the last figure used -- 
to project the amount a taxpayer might actually receive.  
</P>
<P>
 What's the difference? The current system is designed to give you the present 
value of your estimated future benefits -- not the amount of money you will 
actually receive. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, if your 1993 statement said you were entitled to $800 in monthly 
benefits at age 65, it means that when you begin receiving benefits, your 
monthly check at that time should have the same buying power as $800 does 
today. The agency is no longer forecasting exactly what that figure will be, 
only that it should be roughly equivalent to $800 in 1993 dollars.  
</P>
<P>
 Why was the switch made? A couple of reasons. According to the agency, the new 
system should give taxpayers a better idea of the buying power of their future 
retirement benefits. For example, how well can you live on $800 a month right 
now? Will it cover your rent, food, utilities, transportation? Probably not, a 
conclusion that should lead you to begin -- if you haven't already -- your own 
personal retirement savings program.  
</P>
<P>
 Another reason was to eliminate confusion caused by the inflation factor 
projections. In some cases, particularly those involving taxpayers many years 
away from retirement, the amount of inflation-adjusted future benefit estimates 
was obviously far higher than current Social Security benefit limits. It was 
also far in excess of estimates given to older taxpayers much closer to 
retirement, a situation that apparently caused tremendous confusion and 
consternation.  
</P>
<P>
 Can you imagine the reaction of a 55-year-old taxpayer -- who has paid into 
the system for decades and is just 10 years from retirement -- when he 
discovers that his projected benefits are apparently lower than a younger 
worker who has contributed substantially less into the system and is still 
decades away from retirement? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, these apparent discrepancies are the result of applying the 
inflation factor over the remaining employment years of the two workers. But 
try telling that to thousands of irate taxpayers! It was easier just to change 
the estimating system.  
</P>
<P>
 By the way, taxpayers interested in finding out how much they have contributed 
to Social Security and what they can expect to receive upon retirement should 
call (800) 772-1213 and ask for form SSA-7004, "Personal Earnings and Benefit 
Statement." When you get the form, complete it and mail it back to the enclosed 
address. The Social Security Administration will then send you a listing of 
your employment earnings and expected retirement benefits. If you think there 
is an error in the information, call the toll-free phone number provided on the 
form. Taxpayers Responsible for Their Savings Bonds 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I am buying U.S. Savings Bonds on a regular basis as part of my retirement 
planning effort. However, I am concerned about the safety of my certificates in 
the event of fire, loss or theft. Is there any way to have the U.S. Treasury 
hold my certificates just as brokerage houses hold stocks for their clients? -- 
H.M . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Taxpayers are responsible for holding their own Savings Bonds. However, the 
Treasury Department will replace lost, stolen or damaged bonds free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, you would be wise to keep your bonds in the safest possible location, 
such as a safe deposit box at your local bank. You would also be wise to keep a 
list of your bond holdings, including their serial numbers, issue dates, 
denominations and Social Security number of the bondholder, in another equally 
safe spot. (You should do the same thing with other "paper assets," such as 
stock certificates, that you choose to hold yourself.) 
</P>
<P>
 If, however, your Savings Bonds are lost or destroyed, you can get them 
replaced fairly easily. Simply ask your local bank for form PDF 1048, complete 
it and mail it to your local Federal Reserve Bank. Taxpayers in the central and 
western United States can mail the forms to the Federal Reserve Bank of Kansas 
City, P.O. Box 419440, Kansas City, MO 64141-6440. IRA Contribution Deadline Is 
April 15 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Have I missed the deadline for making my 1993 contribution to my 
tax-deferred retirement account? I am self employed and have an SEP-IRA. * 
</P>
<P>
 R.F . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A The deadline for making contributions to individual retirement accounts is 
April 15 of the year following that for which the contributions are being made. 
Contributions to Keogh and SEP-IRA accounts can be made as late as Oct. 15 of 
the year following that for which the contributions are intended, if the 
taxpayer wins an income tax filing extension. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Keogh accounts must be established before the end of the taxable year 
in order to be eligible to accept a contribution for that year. SEP-IRA 
accounts may be established at any time up until the taxpayer's income tax 
filing deadline.

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; VO NGUYEN GIAP; THE MAN WHO LED THE TET OFFENSIVE 
NOW TALKS OF U.S.-VIETNAM TRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John T. McAlister, John T. McAlister, a business executive, is a former 
public-policy and economics professor at Princeton and Stanford. He is the 
author of Vietnam: the Origins of Revolution (Knopf). He interviewed Gen. Vo 
Nguyen Giap during a recent visit to Vietnam. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For close to 50 years, Vietnam's revolutionary leaders and the United States 
have had a complex and troubled relationship of extremes. In 1944, there was 
strong U.S. support for those who sought Vietnam's independence from the 
French. But soon after, Washington became an opponent of the communist-led 
revolution, with an intensity that far exceeded the strength of its initial 
support. By the 1960s, that intensity, now fueled by vehement anti-communism, 
led America into the longest war in its history.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, 20 years after the Vietnam War, leaders in Washington and Hanoi are 
finally talking about opening trade relations. Until recently, Vietnam's 
economy was in desperate condition, in part due to self-imposed difficulties 
but also to U.S. refusal to open economic and diplomatic relations. Lifting the 
embargo would be an important step in accelerating Vietnam's nascent economic 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout these 50 years, one man has remained at the center of events. He is 
Vo Nguyen Giap, 82, who founded Vietnam's revolutionary armed forces in 1944. 
He was at Ho Chi Minh's side when the communist leader declared Vietnam's 
independence in 1945. Also at Ho's side were U.S. army officers who had 
provided critical support to Ho, Giap and their revolutionary colleagues in 
their bid to establish an independent Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years later, the U.S. army would feel the wrath of Giap's response to 
U. S. military intervention in Vietnam. In the 1968 Tet Offensive, Giap 
devastated the U.S. psychologically by orchestrating simultaneous military 
attacks on 68 locations. He had inflicted the same sort of psychological damage 
on the French in the trenches at Dien Bein Phu, 14 years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Giap's success during the Vietnam War was enhanced by his understanding of 
America -- his relationships with U.S. officers during the 1940s were a 
profound experience for him and continue to be a reference point even today. 
Sitting in a conference room at Vietnam's National Institute for Development 
Studies, which he chairs, Giap feels quite comfortable quoting Jefferson -- 
here, as always, following the example set by Ho. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Vietnam's leaders have called for the lifting of the U.S. economic 
embargo and re-establishment of trade and diplomatic relations. Why does 
Vietnam want this?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Lifting the embargo will be good for both the U.S. and Vietnam. Many 
U.S. businesses want to invest in Vietnam because they find attractive 
opportunities here. Numerous representatives of U.S. business are already here 
in anticipation of the embargo being lifted. Despite the limitations imposed by 
the embargo on their activities, the presence of U.S. businesses here 
demonstrates their belief that the opportunities in Vietnam are very large. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign investment in Vietnam is increasing rapidly. Major investments have 
been made by Taiwan, Hong Kong, Australia, South Korea, France and China. 
Vietnam welcomes this investment, because we need it to increase the pace of 
our economic growth. We hope that the U.S. will join with the other leading 
nations of the world in participating in Vietnam's economic future. 
</P>
<P>
 To paraphrase on old saying, "Those who are late will suffer the 
disadvantage." Recognizing this disadvantage, President Clinton issued 
regulations that allow a small opening for U.S. businessmen to enter Vietnam. 
President Clinton has the authority to open full diplomatic and trade relations 
with Vietnam. I call on him to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 . . . . The embargo policy is out of date. The time has come for us to put the 
past behind us and to work together for a better future for both our peoples. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In the United States, there continues to be concern about the U.S. 
servicemen missing in action. How is this issue regarded in Vietnam, and what 
is being done to respond to U.S. concerns?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I want to emphasize most sincerely that I do understand the concerns of 
American families whose loved ones were missing in action. In response to those 
concerns, the Vietnam government has done its best to help find information 
about those missing in action . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam regards the MIA issue as a humanitarian concern and not a political 
issue affecting the normalization of trade and diplomatic relations. The reason 
we regard the MIA issue as a humanitarian concern is because we are looking for 
our own MIA. Our MIA are nearly several hundred times the number of the 
American MIA. (More than 300,000 Vietnamese are missing in action.) . . . . 
Vietnamese families also grieve about those they have lost, and they seek all 
available information, just as American families do. 
</P>
<P>
 . . . Because we share a common problem, Vietnam and the U.S. can benefit by 
pursuing a common solution . . . . American representatives are free to go 
anywhere and to contact anyone concerning MIA(s). We have cooperated, and we 
will continue to cooperate, with U.S. representatives, because we want as much 
information as possible to be obtained. I have personally met with numerous 
American representatives about the MIA problem -- including Gen. John Vessey 
and other veterans. This matter is a personal concern of mine. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, we hope that American representatives will want to help Vietnam 
find information about our own MIAs . . . . Our problem is so much larger that 
a small amount of American help can go a long way toward helping Vietnam with 
its MIA problem. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton's Administration has already given us valuable information 
about those Vietnamese missing in action who were fighting for the former 
Saigon government. This has been helpful but we need more information we 
believe the U.S. government has about this matter. 
</P>
<P>
 . . . So we ask President Clinton to help us with whatever additional 
information can be obtained about the MIAs from the Saigon armed forces, as 
well as any information that the U.S. government may have about our own MIAs . 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 But the important point is that both nations stand to benefit by working 
together in a common humanitarian effort . . . . The common pursuit of MIA 
information should be another positive reason why establishing trade and 
diplomatic relations can be beneficial to both nations. The closer the 
relations between our two countries, the greater our cooperation can be in 
obtaining information about MIAs of both nations . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is your vision of the future of Vietnam?  
</P>
<P>
 A: My vision of the future is based on the perspective of the past. In the 
past, our greatest challenge was the invasion of our nation by foreigners. As 
long as foreigners dominated us, we could not determine our own destiny, nor 
could we deal with our most pressing problems. Now that Vietnam is independent 
and united we can address our biggest challenge. That challenge is poverty and 
economic backwardness. 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam is a poor country but its people are rich in spirit. My vision of the 
future is one in which the rich spirit of the Vietnamese people will cause our 
nation to prosper. . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 You have come to Hanoi on the 21st anniversary of the U.S. Christmas bombing 
of our capital city. This bombing destroyed the Bach Mai Hospital. I was in 
Hanoi at the time of the raid. In the many years of U.S. bombing prior to the 
Christmas raid, I thought that Americans wanted to make our country look like a 
moonscape. With the Christmas air raid, I began to feel that the target had 
become the spirit of the Vietnamese people, especially those in Hanoi. Although 
the Vietnamese people had withstood many challenges over many centuries, the 
Christmas air raid of 1972 was a new and formidable difficulty. While I was 
confident that the spirit of the Vietnamese people would prevail, I looked for 
signs of the demonstration of that spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the Christmas air raid, Price Sihanouk of Cambodia and his wife, 
Princess Monique, came to visit Hanoi. I met them at the airport and escorted 
them into the city. As we drove from the airport, Prince Sihanouk said that he 
could see in the eyes of the people along the roadway a sense of pride and a 
optimistic spirit . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnam is a nation that is several thousand years old. Our nation has 
survived because our culture is strong. The spirit of our people is strong. 
Fixed in the soul of every Vietnamese is the strong belief that we will 
prosper. Some may call this social psychology. But call it what you will, 
Vietnam will prevail in the future as in the past because of the spirit of our 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Looking back, could conflict between the U.S. and Vietnam have been 
avoided?  
</P>
<P>
 A: This is a very complicated question, which is difficult to give a precise 
answer. At the end of World War II, Ho Chi Minh wanted peace, but France wanted 
to regain control over Vietnam after losing its position as a result of Japan's 
wartime occupation. France was prepared for war to regain control. We 
Vietnamese wanted our independence and freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to the collapse of Japanese authority in Vietnam in 1945, U.S. Army 
officers were sent to our country to help us prepare for our independence. I 
especially recall Maj. (Allison K.) Thomas, who was a native of Michigan. Ho 
Chi Minh told Maj. Thomas and other American officers in our country, in 1945, 
that he saw good relations with the U.S. after the end of World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Ho Chi Minh was initially correct. America did not support the French return 
to Vietnam. But the American position changed in the 1950s with the adoption of 
the "domino theory," in which the U.S. came to believe that what happened in 
Vietnam would affect all of Southeast Asia . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back in history, there can be no doubt that an important opportunity 
for good relations between Vietnam and America existed at the end of World War 
II. Regrettably, this opportunity was missed. Now, nearly 50 years later, there 
is another important opportunity for good relations between Vietnam and 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 Will a second important opportunity be lost? Let us make sure that this 
present opportunity is not lost. Let us make sure that Vietnam and America work 
together to benefit the people of both of our countries. 
</P>
<P>
 What lessons can be learned from the past relations between Vietnam and 
America? It seems to me that there are three. First, do not go to war with a 
nation that is fighting for its independence. Since America fought its own war 
for independence, I believe Americans can agree with this lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, no matter how large a nation's military and economic power, there are 
always limits. Nations that recognize their limits, and act accordingly, are 
more likely to be successful. An arrogance of power has been the downfall of 
many great nations. No nation is immune to either the limits to power or the 
tendency to the arrogance of power. Recognizing the one and avoiding the other 
can be a lesson all nations should agree on. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, whatever the policies of leaders of nations, it is ultimately the 
people who will decide. If leaders pursue wrong policies, the people will not 
follow. If leaders pursue right policies, the people will confirm their 
rightness by giving their support; the more nations follow the decisions of 
their people, the more successful they will be.

DRUG LORDS VS. THE TARAHUMARA ; TRAFFICERS ARE INVADING MEXICO'S MOST 
SPECTACULAR FORESTS, DESTROYING ANCIENT TREES -- AND ANY NATIVES WHO OBJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alan Weisman, Contributing editor Alan Weisman's last piece for this 
magazine was on northern Spain's carnaval. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 THERE WASN'T MUCH MORE THE OLD Tarahumara Indian healer, Agustin Ramos, could 
do for the man taking refuge in Pino Gordo, high in Mexico's western Sierra 
Madre: All the medicine that grows in the Sierra couldn't reverse the damage 
that automatic weapons had wreaked upon 30-year-old Gumersindo Torres. 
Nevertheless, he entered his dream to ask his god, Onuruame, what might bring 
the broken young man some relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Presently, the One Who Is Father appeared behind his closed eyelids, looking 
much like Ramos himself: headband, single-thonged sandals strapped to bare 
legs, a breechclout secured by a tasseled girdle covering his loins. Onuruame 
directed the old man to prepare poultices and teas of verbena and chuchufate , 
plants found in Pino Gordo's ancient forest, to soothe Torres' bruises and 
restore his tranquillity.  
</P>
<P>
 Torres had come because his own ancestral village, two days away either by 
foot or truck via the new logging road, was now the most dangerous place in the 
Sierra. His community, Coloradas de La Virgen, lies at the edge of a monstrous 
abyss in the Mexican state of Chihuahua called the Barranca Sinforosa, about 
250 miles south of El Paso, Tex. Tarahumaras have lived and gathered there for 
at least 6,000 years, but until the family of murderers who now ruled the area 
could be brought to justice, no Indian in Coloradas de La Virgen was safe.

 On that chilly night in November, 1992, when Torres was left for dead, two of 
the killers had burst into the church where Tarahumara men and women were 
swaying to the violins and drumbeats of their ritual prayer dance. First the 
gunmen shot Torres' brother, the local Indian vice-governor, just as they had 
slain his uncle, a commissioner, a year earlier. With Torres, who they 
suspected was involved with environmental groups lately meddling in these 
mountains, they took their time, blasting him in the right shoulder, then the 
left, then shattering one of his hips with an AK-47. 
</P>
<P>
 He survived because their parting shot to his head, fired as he writhed on the 
floor, only creased his scalp. Afterward, unable to walk his fields or chop 
firewood, Torres was taken to Pino Gordo and then given a small stipend from 
funds that had trickled down to the Indians through a succession of 
international environmental organizations. Among his objectives: to help this 
community resist the scourge of opium and marijuana that had poisoned his own 
village and whose spreading cultivation now threatened one of the continent's 
most crucial ecosystems and its people.  
</P>
<P>
 But how? The bullet holes that Torres insisted on showing me, sprinkled around 
his broken body by Coloradas de la Virgen's narcotraficantes , were sickening 
reminders of how defenseless one of Mexico's largest Indian tribes had become. 
For centuries, the Tarahumara, who today number 50,000, had mostly known peace 
and seclusion. They lived in tiny enclaves dispersed through the Sierra's 
labyrinthine terrain, which they bridged by becoming the world's greatest 
distance runners, often covering 60 miles between settlements in a single 
jaunt. (In their own language, the Tarahumara call themselves Raramuri -- foot 
runner.) Now I was hearing that many non-Indians who had invaded this 
precipitous country in recent years to steal the Tarahumaras' timber were also 
clearing their land to reap a growing harvest of pot and raw opium gum. 
</P>
<P>
 Indians who protested have been routinely shot, and local authorities have 
been either too intimidated or too implicated to protect them. Few of the mild, 
agrarian Tarahumara own firearms or would use them on humans if they did. Have 
any of their dream-healers, I asked, pressed God for a cure for the 
narcotic-induced death now spreading throughout the Sierra? 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, old Agustin Ramos told me, he had tried several times: lately, the 
dreaded plantios were blossoming even around his remote Pino Gordo, among 
freshly charred remains of some of the oldest trees in Mexico. Each time, 
though, he got the same frustrating answer: 
</P>
<P>
 "Onuruame can't destroy plants that are also part of his creation," he said. 
"We will have to save ourselves from narcotrafico ." 
</P>
<P>
 WHEN, FOR WHATEVER DIVINE MOTIVE, onuruame created opium poppies, enabling 
humans subsequently to manufacture heroin, he did so not here but in Asia. 
Chinese traders who settled in the town of Culiacan -- today northwestern 
Mexico's leading cocaine distribution center -- brought the first seeds during 
the 1930s. The vast mountain range that paralleled the Pacific coastal plains 
seemed a logical, virtually unpatrollable place to cultivate both the colorful 
flowers and another Far East import, Cannabis sativa -- marijuana. Few human 
beings then realized the troubling implications, not only for Tarahumara 
Indians but for the Sierra itself, because no one yet understood that Mexico's 
Sierra Madre Occidental was the richest biosystem in North America. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 50 million years earlier, this region had simply exploded, spewing 
enormous quantities of volcanic dust into the atmosphere, which settled and 
metamorphosed into powdery layers of gray tuff and pink rhyolite. Then, as the 
shifting Pacific plate ripped Baja California away from mainland Mexico, runoff 
draining toward the widening trench that became the Gulf of California rapidly 
eroded the soft cap rock into a network of deep canyons. At the same time, huge 
blocks of crust were collapsing along innumerable faults as western Mexico 
continued to thrust upward. Eventually, all this tumult left a jumble of 
colossal barriers interspersed with immense chasms. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the myriad niches of this elaborate landscape evolved a woodland like 
none other. Here grow more different pines than anywhere else on earth and more 
than 200 oak species. Recently, biologists have realized that for sheer 
diversity, the western Sierra Madre surpasses even Mexico's cloud and rain 
forests. In pockets of human habitation, ethnobotanists have discovered an 
unprecedented genetic repository here: scores of heirloom strains of beans, 
squash, gourds, chiles, melons, herbs, medicinal plants and, especially, corn. 
Indian farmers instinctively had assured the success of nearly 20 distinct 
races of maize by cross-pollinating them with stands of teosinte, corn's 
prehistoric ancestor, found growing alongside their fields. 
</P>
<P>
 This splendid cache remained relatively isolated until 1962 when, 87 years 
after construction commenced, the Chihuahua al Pacifico Railroad finally 
succeeded in spanning the tangled Sierra Madre. The route instantly became 
famed for thrilling vistas of the geological complex known collectively as the 
Barranca del Cobre, or Copper Canyon -- a system of four gorges bigger and 
deeper than Arizona's Grand Canyon. Bird watchers and backpackers thronged to 
view collared trogons and magpie jays with two-foot tails; oaks whose leaves 
ranged from slivers to giant, velvety lobes, and pines with drooping needles so 
long that Indians wove them into baskets. The fabulously picturesque Tarahumara 
themselves -- bronzed, beautifully muscled -- formed an idyllic portrait of 
indigenous people thriving in pristine innocence as they trotted easily up 
steep canyon trails, entire haystacks of corn fodder strapped to their backs. 
</P>
<P>
 But by 1988, when I first saw the Barranca del Cobre, the purity was becoming 
sullied. For two weeks, five companions and I had hiked over snow-covered rim 
country and descended into barrancas more than a mile deep, where green 
parakeets flitted through tamarind and citrus trees. When we finally reached 
the town of Batopilas, site of a Jesuit mission to the Tarahumara, we promptly 
located a restaurant. But inside we found a white-faced cook sitting with a 
pile of metallic blue automatic rifles heaped on his trembling knees. At one 
table, four men wearing reptile-skin boots and clumps of gold jewelry regarded 
us with silent stares, and nobody moved for the next 45 minutes while they 
finished eating.  
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, a priest whispered that the two Tarahumara families huddled 
in the mission chapel were hiding from these men: five Indians, he said, had 
just been massacred for refusing to tend illicit crops. Downriver, the captain 
of a Mexican army patrol, his olive-drabs brightened by the addition of lizard 
footwear and half a pound of gold chain, reassured us that all was serene. We 
trudged on; a day later, four men on horseback, leading a string of well-laden 
mules, nodded politely but kept their weapons trained on us while we passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last Christmas, a group of Tucson naturalists I knew unwittingly strayed 
where they were not welcome; two of the men were pistol-whipped and one woman 
raped. Now I was in the Sierra Madre again, this time in the back of a 
four-wheel-drive Ford pickup, flanked by three Mexican federal police officers 
carrying Chinese-manufactured AK-47s equipped with 35-cartridge banana clips. 
Wedged into nylon holsters on their belts were 9-millimeter Smith & Wesson 
semiautomatic pistols. Our mission: to find where marijuana and opium growers 
were burning this precious forest to sow illegal crops, terrorizing Indians in 
the process. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Mexico's federales are famed more for collusion than combat with drug 
thugs, my escorts did not instill great confidence, but I had no choice. They 
were sent by Teresa Jardi, the new federal attorney general for the state of 
Chihuahua, who assured me that I was in trusted hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are fresh from the police academy. It takes a few months before the 
narcotraficantes contaminate them." 
</P>
<P>
 "And then?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I get rid of them and bring in another batch." 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico, any attempt to accurately gauge progress in stemming the 
unmeasurable tonnage of drugs that flows across the border each day is 
effectively undermined by such systemic graft. According to recent U.S. State 
Department reports, drug trafficking has declined here since 1990, but locals 
in Chihuahua scoff at such pronouncements, pointing out that they're based on 
figures supplied by the Mexican government.  
</P>
<P>
 Just last February, Jardi, then a veteran human-rights advocate, was leading a 
campaign to throw the federal attorney general's office out of Chihuahua, so 
thoroughly polluted had it become by drug money. Then, in the wake of the 
drug-related slaying of the Catholic cardinal of Guadalajara, her old law 
school classmate and founder of Mexico's Human Rights Commission, Jorge 
Carpizo, took over the country's legal system. As national attorney general, 
Carpizo assigned Chihuahua to Jardi: Mexico's biggest state, with 480 miles of 
largely unguarded border with the United States and regarded by U.S. 
drug-enforcement officials as a lawless void. By August, Jardi had purged more 
than 50 corrupt federal comandantes and district attorneys, and, she now 
boasted, was actually "fielding police without entire jewelry stores hanging 
from their necks." 
</P>
<P>
 A petite, graying woman in her early 50s, Jardi was especially proud that 
Chihuahua's jails were no longer filled with peasants and Indians coerced at 
gunpoint to plant contraband, then nabbed during bogus raids while the true 
mafiosi roamed untouched. But this past fall, the week before I arrived, her 
success began to wear thin. Jardi had requisitioned three helicopters from 
Mexico City and invited Tarahumara leaders, whose pastures lately had been 
filling with poppies, on a search-and-destroy mission. The pilots dutifully 
sprayed several small patches with defoliant. But when the Indians directed 
them to a field that stretched for several acres, two of the choppers fled. 
When Jardi ordered her pilot to continue, he landed next to the plantation's 
isolated headquarters and told her to discuss it with the people inside. She 
refused to leave the helicopter, a decision that possibly saved her life, and 
the poppy farm remained intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Chihuahua City, Jardi soon discovered that she had a rat among her new 
police officials. She had assembled her comandantes to meet with Edwin 
Bustillos, director of the Consejo Asesor Sierra Madre, a nonprofit group 
promoting environmentally sound farming and timber practices. Bustillos, a 
29-year-old mestizo agricultural engineer, grew up among the Tarahumara and 
credited their healers for his recovery from a near-fatal accident. Now he was 
trying to help them preserve their shrinking resources, but lately he found 
himself spending more time saving humans than trees.  
</P>
<P>
 It was Bustillos who took Gumersindo Torres to Pino Gordo and then collected 
enough testimonies from witnesses that bloody night in Coloradas de la Virgen 
to actually jail two gunmen, Tacho Molina and Agustin Fontes. Now, in secret 
meetings, he was requesting Madame Attorney General to pursue Fontes' uncle 
Artemio, whom he alleged to be the real strongman behind illegal logging, 
cattle rustling and dope growing on Indian lands around Coloradas de la Virgen, 
as well as the ruthless author of many murders. 
</P>
<P>
 The accusation surprised no one. Artemio Fontes was a well-known and 
well-connected cacique of the Sierra, whose powerful but reckless family had 
yanked themselves violently from rural poverty. During the early '80s, Artemio 
Fontes' brother Alejandro was named head of the Chihuahua state police, a 
position he enjoyed until the army shot him down in a plane stuffed with 
marijuana. Fontes' men often engaged in blood feuds with outsiders and 
frequently with each other. Each week, wealthy Fontes widows could be seen 
driving fine four-wheel-drive vehicles into town from the rancho to shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Jardi called another meeting to examine information that Bustillos 
claimed linked Artemio Fontes to several Tarahumara deaths in Coloradas de la 
Virgen. Caciques elsewhere in the Sierra, he warned, were increasingly 
emboldened by Fontes' impunity. Artemio Fontes could be seen frequently in 
restaurants in Chihuahua City, where he now resided in an elegant neighborhood: 
a man with silver-flecked hair and gold-tipped boots, in the company of friends 
like former Chihuahua Gov. Fernando Baeza. Meanwhile, three to four Tarahumara 
and neighboring Tepehuan Indians were being killed each week. Bustillos again 
had a stack of testimonies with signatures or thumbprints. Jardi was 
sufficiently persuaded to order a formal investigation. Someone else at this 
confidential gathering apparently was also impressed: a day later, gunmen shot 
up Bustillos' house in the Sierra.  
</P>
<P>
 The next day, in Chihuahua City, Bustillos met with his U.S.-based funding 
partner, Randall Gingrich, director of the tiny Arizona Rainforest Alliance. 
Gingrich, who wrote his master's thesis on deforestation in the Sierra Madre, 
had garnered a small chunk of USAID money administered through a coalition of 
the World Wildlife Fund, the Nature Conservancy and the World Resources 
Institute, earmarked for easing biological impacts of Third World development. 
But the threats to the environment listed in their proposal had not included 
the armed men they now could see parked outside their office.  
</P>
<P>
 They managed to slip away and headed for the border. Gingrich tried to 
convince Bustillos to lie low in Tucson awhile, but within a week he was 
restless and returned to Mexico. Now, seated on an ammunition box between me 
and the federales , he was heading off to find some flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 VIDAL VALENCIA HAD drunk a lot of tesguino , the corn beer that accompanies 
all Tarahumara gatherings, before he finally raised his hand. The occasion was 
an assembly of Redondeados, his community deep in southern Chihuahua, where 
human-rights workers were asking whose lands had been invaded lately. Valencia 
wasn't sure which was more frightening: the new poppy fields he found every 
time one of his cows strayed, or what might happen if he reported them. But 
Edwin Bustillos had promised that the police now intended to help Indians, not 
to beat and jail them as in previous dope raids. And they knew of the risk 
Bustillos, a marked man, was taking to come here. 
</P>
<P>
 We were driving in a light rain through the wedge between the states of 
Durango and Sinaloa known as Chihuahua's Golden Triangle. "Pick your gold: our 
richest forests or richest drug crops," Bustillos said. Severed from the rest 
of the state by the great canyons to the north, the region was tied closely to 
Culiacan, source of the weapons and South American cocaine that were luring 
more young local mestizos into choosing narcotrafico.  
</P>
<P>
 A World Bank loan recently proposed for this area, intended to make 
Chihuahua's timber industry more competitive, had been delayed by international 
protests when road building began before required environmental assessments 
were made. Bustillos, originally hired by the Mexican government as regional 
manager of a World Bank-funded forestry-development program, was one of the 
critics, because new roads would enter virgin Indian lands. Now, after two 
slapdash impact studies were successfully challenged, the World Bank was ready 
to resume disbursements, as soon as Mexico came up with its matching portion, 
$48 million. Besides the predicted habitat damage and erosion from increased 
logging, Bustillos feared that better roads would be a gift to narcotraficantes 
, currently bulldozing their way into places once never imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico, however, was in enough debt already and not inclined just yet to turn 
these primitive Sierra lumber trails into passable highways. The fractured 
bedrock and slick rhyolite clays we were bouncing over had already eaten one of 
the police vehicles, a Chevy Suburban van, that was supposed to take us up to 
Vidal Valencia's mountain pastures. A backup four-wheel-drive pickup had 
arrived from headquarters in Parral, Chihuahua, 10 hours away, without a spare 
tire. His budget was so thin, Comandante Serafin Cocones of the narcotics squad 
told us, that it wasn't just tires: He and four men had to buy their own 
ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 Now we were following a borrowed Datsun with a cracked chassis, crammed with 
Tarahumaras, as well as a contingent of five municipal police armed with 
hunting rifles and ornate pistols, whom Cocones had mustered that morning 
simply for more firepower. Since most local police are assumed to augment their 
$200 monthly salaries with narcotrafico themselves, there was some question as 
to which way they might aim in the event of a shootout. "What choice is there?" 
Cocones lamented. "If someone really wants to defend these plants, we'll need 
50 men against their weapons." 
</P>
<P>
 The road dissolved into a giant gully. We continued into the forest on foot, 
which made the Tarahumaras much happier. I half-walked, half-ran to keep up 
with Vidal, a thin, taciturn man in a red plaid shirt, and his 80-year-old 
cousin, Tirso Tellez, who leaped over outcroppings and scrambled up mountain 
arroyos where we stopped to drink from streams and catch our breath. These men 
had grown up playing rarajipari , Tarahumara kick-ball, over courses that 
sometimes stretched 50 miles. Their great-uncle Tibursio, Tellez told me, once 
ran the 110-mile round trip to Culiacan to deliver a message the day before an 
important match and returned in time to pace his team to victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Above us, thick-billed parrots frisked through the Chihuahua pines, showering 
us with droplets that hung from the elongated needles. We heard the triple hoot 
of a Mexican spotted owl but saw no mammals except for the flash of a 
white-tailed deer's rump. The last grizzlies were killed here some years ago, 
but, Tellez was telling me, jaguar and Mexican gray wolves still stalk this 
pine-oak-juniper maze. Suddenly, Vidal stopped and pointed. At his feet was a 
steaming pile of fresh dung, surrounded by mule-shoe prints. Instantly, 
Comandante Cocones motioned for the police to fan out. 
</P>
<P>
 They spread across the hills, running silently along the ridges. The rest of 
us crept behind Cocones, scanning the perimeter and treetops for snipers. We 
inched forward and listened. Nothing. Finally we crested a small rise and 
looked down. Even the Indians gasped. 
</P>
<P>
 Below us, a swath of miraculous color burst from the dark green forest: pinks 
segueing to purples, pale lavenders, bright crimsons -- big, papery flowers 
that intermixed nearly the entire blue-red spectrum, fluttering on waist-high 
stalks. To see a field of poppies such as these is to begin to grasp the 
irresistible, addictive nature of opium. These plants did not belong here, and 
their presence signified great danger. But for a few moments everyone simply 
gazed at their beauty, so soft and seductive, like lotus blossoms floating atop 
the blood and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 We had found roughly an acre of blooms, surrounded by three strands of new 
barbed wire, in a clearing of downed trees that had been burned. A ragged shirt 
and a pair of old jeans tied to a stick served as a scarecrow. There was a 
moment of confusion: The federales had forgotten wire cutters, but I had a pair 
on my utility knife. As the fence tumbled, the police and the Tarahumaras 
picked up sticks and began whacking the olive-green stems. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever tended this field evidently had just departed, because the round bulbs 
left on plants that had already dropped their petals had been freshly scored. 
One of the local police, looking a little bereaved, showed me how to cut and 
squeeze the bulb until milky white syrup bubbled out, every drop of which 
harvesters collected in vials made from battery casings, where it coagulates 
into brown gum. In Parral, he said, the goma brings 10,000 pesos per gram: 
slightly more than $3. 
</P>
<P>
 Resting that afternoon on a log in the 10th field Vidal showed us, while the 
police built a bonfire of 200 pounds of marijuana they'd also discovered 
growing there, Bustillos and I did some calculating. About 10 poppy bulbs yield 
a gram of opium gum, and a bulb can be milked from three to 10 times. 
Bustillos, who had paced the boundaries of each plantio , reckoned that we'd 
destroyed about 12 acres. Figuring 10 bulbs per square yard, that represented 
at least 150,000 grams of opium gum, worth $450,000 at its crudest stage. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10 grams of opium gum produce a single gram of heroin, which brings 
anywhere from $80 to $500 in the United States, depending on the city. In a few 
hours, I realized, we had removed millions of dollars' worth of untaxed goods 
from the market, plus at least another hundred grand for the pot now going up 
in flames. No matter at what point in the processing and shipping Artemio 
Fontes took his cut, I guessed that he would be upset, because we had just 
relieved him of a small fortune.  
</P>
<P>
 "These plants don't belong to Fontes. He's from over there," Bustillos 
replied, pointing northwest toward Coloradas de la Virgen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whose, then?" 
</P>
<P>
 He shrugged his thin shoulders. "Who knows? There are so many growers now." 
</P>
<P>
 Behind us, the Sierra Madre dropped into Arroyo Hondo, a minor canyon compared 
to the barrancas to the north, but sufficiently vast to convey the impression 
that no one could ever eradicate dope cultivation here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly," Bustillos said, "I don't care if they do. I just want growers to 
stay out of the last hidden sanctuaries and stop bothering the Indians who know 
how to care for them." 
</P>
<P>
 "But they choose those places because growing dope is illegal. How can you 
keep them out?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Simple. Legalize it." 
</P>
<P>
 BEFORE WE LEFT, I ASKED Vidal Valencia, who now looked a little worried, what 
the Tarahumaras thought of legalization. After rephrasing the question twice, I 
let it drop: The concept of plants being unlawful was alien to him. All he knew 
was that, despite the Mexican constitution that recognizes Indians' rights to 
defend their land, someone was going to be mad about this. "When the police go, 
they could grab us," he observed. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next two days, we struggled up 40 miles of atrocious roads toward Pino 
Gordo, where Teresa Jardi and another helicopter were meeting us for more 
raids. At times we passed through deforested stretches where loggers had taken 
the best pines; left without sufficient cover, the smaller trees left for seed 
stock had dried up. At lumber mills, we saw Tarahumaras working the worst jobs, 
hauling sawdust and dragging huge trunks to the blade. Supposedly, Bustillos' 
funding was designated to help Indians gain control of and properly manage wood 
resources that were legally theirs, but the fallout of drugs had become a 
constant distraction. In every village, we heard of shootings.  
</P>
<P>
 The road rose through spruce and aspen, then traversed hairpin ledges where 
waterfalls gushed between enormous boulders. We were nearing Pino Gordo, which 
has the largest stand of old-growth forest left in the Sierra Madre. Comandante 
Cocones grew edgy because of a rumored 5-million-peso ($1,600) bounty on 
policemen in the area. In the valley below was Coloradas de los Chavez: Some 
members of the extended Chavez family were reputed to be as charming as the 
Fontes. Last year, the Tarahumaras of Pino Gordo had found their first 
marijuana plantation. By this spring there were nine, and by autumn, 17. Armed 
men from Coloradas de los Chavez were appearing in Pino Gordo, offering money 
and corn in exchange for labor in the plantios. They arrived over the same new 
road we were traveling, illegally opened by loggers, and made it plain that 
they were coming in with or without the Tarahumaras' cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, it wasn't unknown for a Tarahumara to agree to plant a little pot 
in exchange for food or a few pesos, but with people dying and large chunks of 
their forest disappearing, the situation was now getting out of control. That 
afternoon, the men and women of Pino Gordo gathered at the log cabin 
schoolhouse. They hoped to see Bustillos and the federal attorney and police 
who promised to help rid them of narco-terror, but by then we were long gone. 
Teresa Jardi and the helicopter had never appeared. Later I learned that, 
despite her livid denunciation of the pilots she had recently flown with, she 
had been sent the same crew again. Without air support, Cocones refused to 
destroy any plantios here. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's only one road," he said. "Without air cover to get us out of here, 
they can roll a tree trunk or boulder across one of those ledges, then pick us 
off like pigeons."  
</P>
<P>
 To raid Pino Gordo properly, Cocones added, would require 100 men on the 
ground and 20 giving air support. It would take a week here, with tents and 
sleeping bags -- things he didn't have. There was no budget. Cocones, with a 
plastic right shoulder joint as a memento of his last drug shootout, was 
getting no argument from his green troops. "I'll try to return with 
reinforcements," he told the Tarahumaras.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet if he did, I realized, these Indians would then be sitting ducks, and Pino 
Gordo would become another Coloradas de la Virgen. Cocones couldn't refute 
this. "Then how can you ever stop the killing?" I asked.  
</P>
<P>
 "Easy," he said. "Legalize drugs. They'll lose so much value that they won't 
be worth killing for." He snapped open the folding stock of his Galil. "It's 
the only way. Instead of public safety, we have shootings. We shoot one 
narcotraficante and another steps into his place. Instead of prevention and 
rehabilitation, our budget goes into uprooting plants. And they just keep 
planting more."  
</P>
<P>
 I had heard this proposal a few years earlier, in Colombia, where so many 
people were dying that the government in Bogota openly contemplated 
decriminalizing drugs simply to halt the carnage. The United States warned that 
such a move would put diplomatic relations at risk. Since then, however, 
Americans such as former Secretary of State George P. Shultz, columnist William 
F. Buckley Jr., economist Milton Friedman, several federal judges, the mayor of 
Baltimore and, most recently, U.S. Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders have argued 
that too much time, money, and blood are being wasted in a futile war on drugs. 
Legalization advocates cite the example of Holland to show that 
decriminalization doesn't cause a surge in addiction, any more than ending 
Prohibition here increased alcoholism, and that drug-related crime actually 
drops. The potential tax revenues from legal drugs could help pay for a massive 
national drug education program, to say nothing of reallocation of the United 
States' current $8.3-billion drug-enforcement budget. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration officials counter that legalization would 
fill our highways and workplaces with stoned drivers and employees and 
needlessly jeopardize the mental and physical health of future generations of 
productive citizens. The DEA also denies that the war on drugs is hopeless, 
citing Department of Health and Human Services figures showing that usage in 
fact is declining. When I inquired about the source of these figures, however, 
I learned that they are derived from door-to-door samplings of households, a 
seemingly dubious measure of illegal activity. An HHS statistician defended the 
method, which uses an anonymous questionnaire, but admitted that the polls were 
probably worthless in monitoring heroin abuse, which even the DEA admits is 
rising. 
</P>
<P>
 For or against, none of these arguments mention the human sorrow and 
ecological loss being wreaked upon neighbors beyond our borders. I decided to 
ask Artemio Fontes, whose number I found in the Chihuahua City directory, what 
he thought. After several tries, one of his bodyguards told me that, "Senor 
Fontes says anything you want to know about him, ask the attorney general. She 
seems to have all the facts." This apparently didn't trouble Fontes; weeks 
later, a 64-page file Jardi submitted to a panel of judges, charging Fontes 
with both homicide and drug trafficking, failed to produce a warrant for his 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tell me they are very behind," Jardi explained. How long? "Months. Maybe 
a year. Who knows?" 
</P>
<P>
 I took a taxi to Fontes' house. The watchman said he was out. Standing there, 
I realized that Artemio Fontes certainly wouldn't want drugs legalized if in 
fact their value, bloated by virtue of being forbidden, had afforded him this 
agglomeration of carved wooden doors and shiny white brick, surrounded by 
rosebushes and iron bars.  
</P>
<P>
 ON MY LAST DAY IN THE Sierra, I accompanied Edwin Bustillos to his home 
village, Guachochi, where he broadcasts a weekly radio show in four dialects to 
educate Indians about their rights and their priceless environment, encouraging 
them to unite against unscrupulous lumber caciques and narcotraficantes. He was 
pleased, he told me, because he had obtained from witnesses the license number 
of the truck whose occupants had fired at his house, which he was passing along 
to Teresa Jardi. 
</P>
<P>
 We walked outside. The truck with the offending license plate, from the state 
of Sinaloa, was parked next to his car. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd better get out of here," Bustillos sighed.

THE FIRES WITHIN; AT A NAZI CONCENTRATION CAMP, A WRITER CONFRONTS HIS OWN 
DARKNESS-AND FINDS THE TOOLS TO TRANSFORM THE FORCES THAT CAN DESTROY A 
COMMUNITY, OR NUMB THE HUMAN HEART

<P>
 Ladybug, ladybug, Fly away home, Your house is on fire, Your children will 
burn. * 
</P>
<P>
 When I was a child, I sang this version of the nursery rhyme. It always 
frightened me to think of the last two lines. I used to imagine the terror in 
the poor ladybug's heart. I used to picture her fleeing through the air, more 
lightning bug or firefly than ladybug, to save her children from the deadly 
flames. Any parent would certainly do the same. Anyone , for that matter, would 
do whatever was needed to put out the fire. Wouldn't they? 
</P>
<P>
 But what about fires of a more subtle nature? Not less deadly, you understand, 
but more invisible at first, because they are more everyday and familiar. What 
about the low-level fires that burn constantly and quietly in the human heart, 
creating a continuity of background tension in our community, the ones that 
only flare up when personal and social conditions intensify the fuel load and 
people begin to burn from the inside out until we have the kind of flash-point 
fires we have witnessed in the hills and streets of our community? What about 
the fires that help kindle these explosions? Will we do what must be done to 
understand them and put them out? Or will we continue to turn from them, 
denying that they exist, or what is more common, justify them, giving all sorts 
of reasons why they are good fires, deserved fires, righteous fires, moral 
fires, our fires? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, I am talking symbolically about the fires of suspicion, fear, 
hatred, misunderstanding and the belief that people we perceive as not like 
ourselves are somehow essentially other and therefore worthy of being seen in 
the distorted and distorting lightof these embers that threaten to consume us. 
Which is exactly what will happen if we do not look deeply at ourselves and 
transform these hot spots from the blindness of their heat to the potential of 
their light very soon. For we are a city on fire -- a city where armed response 
proliferates in the neighborhoods of rich and poor alike, where the persistent 
contrast of privilege and neglect has created enough friction to whip the 
flames of hopelessness, frustration and rage into the twisted cycle of action 
and revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not easy to talk this way. It is not pleasant to imagine we live in a 
city composed of volatile human embers that burn away largely unnoticed in the 
deep unconscious of our personal and collective mind. And it is especially 
uncomfortable to admit that we are part of that burning. It is threatening to 
our sense of who we believe ourselves to be. We are, in the main, good people 
after all. But when we dare to embrace the reality that we, in our most 
intimate feelings and thoughts, often burn in exactly this way, we have already 
done something constructive to help abate the potential rage of these fires. 
Our awareness is, then, a kind of controlled burn that transforms the raw 
energy of misunderstood and unexamined emotions into the energy for 
constructive action and hope. 
</P>
<P>
 And it only takes repositioning the finger that we so readily point at others 
and shifting our attention and awareness to ourselves for this transformation 
to begin. When we make this small but potent effort with the courage to know 
what we human beings are personally capable of in both creative and destructive 
ways, we take the first action needed to set these fires to rest. Or better 
yet, harness the fuel load they depend upon for their lives and put it to use 
for the benefit of others and ourselves. For when we look with care at our own 
unexplored, fear-driven suspicions and hatreds and how we project these onto 
the blank, faceless screens we have made of people we perceive as other , we 
unleash this potential and create the ability to be free of our own blindness. 
And the most beneficial way to approach this is with an attitude of inquiry and 
nonaggression toward ourselves -- for we are not seeking to blame but to build 
a foundation of understanding and change. 
</P>
<P>
 I KNOW WE ARE CAPABLE OF DOING THIS BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED to me as I stood 
in the remains of the concentration camp called Mauthausen in upper Austria. In 
1990, I had been traveling through Europe on a writing grant and suddenly 
became possessed with the idea that I had to go where I most did not want to go 
and see what I most feared and had avoided thus far in my journey. (The process 
of looking deeply at oneself is often exactly like this.) I would go to the 
site of a Nazi concentration camp and witness one of the places where humans 
have enacted some of their worst crimes against other humans. Notice, even now 
as I write this, how I say humans and their. Even now, knowing what I know, I 
want to be safe. I want those who conceive and commit such atrocities as were 
enacted within the walls of the Nazi camps to be someone clearly and 
essentially other than myself. This need, which holds hope in its fist, dies 
hard. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, I didn't really have a clear understanding of the suddenness of 
my decision to go, but I do know this: Often the complexly generous depths of 
our psyche create the conditions in which we will ask exactly the right 
question of ourselves so that we may listen to the answer and grow. And then, 
perhaps it was also something stubborn, unheroic and ironic in me remembering 
that not so long ago many people in Europe didn't get to decide whether or not 
to go to a concentration camp. Maybe that's why I had to go now. 
</P>
<P>
 I knew the name, Mauthausen, and my hands trembled as I opened the map to the 
index to find out how to get there, because I couldn't believe I was actually 
going to see the word: Mauthausen. Mauthausen, Dachau, Auschwitz, Birkenau, 
Bergen-Belsen. I don't even know how I came to know these names so well, but 
I've known them since I was a child and could repeat them like a rosary. I 
looked down through the M's until there it was, and I was stunned to see it 
listed like any other city or town. But this was all wrong. It should have an 
asterisk beside it. It should be underlined, or marked in bold letters, or 
capitals, or it should take up a whole page by itself. Because that's how large 
the word was in my mind. But it just said, Mauthausen, Page 178, E-5. The route 
led across Germany into Austria, near the town of Linz. If I hurried, I could 
be there in five hours. I noted the irony of a Jew speeding to get to a 
concentration camp before it closes and headed for the autobahn in the Volvo I 
borrowed from a friend whose family fled the Nazi hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 But, the drive didn't prove to be that easy. For one thing, I found myself 
scanning the radio dial, looking for something familiar, but all I heard were 
programs in German. It didn't surprise me that this was so; after all, I was in 
Germany. But perhaps the knowledge that I was going to visit a concentration 
camp did kick into gear a certain fear and unconscious predisposition within me 
-- fed by a lifetime of personal and societal images and messages created by 
media, attitudes picked up from adults in my postwar childhood, the manner in 
which I was taught to think about the German people in my early education, etc. 
-- to dislike the sound of the language. Yes, the sound of German itself 
triggers a preconditioned flood of distaste for its tone, its nuance. (A German 
friend in Berlin, born in the 1950s, once told me tearfully that when she 
traveled abroad, all she had to do was begin to speak, and the cold shroud of 
ostracism and dislike would begin in the strangers around her.) Here I am, a 
poet, finding the language of Goethe, Rilke, Kafka nothing more than a series 
of arrogant barks and derisive-sounding insinuations. 
</P>
<P>
 Again, I didin't understand the content of the sentences I heard, but the lid 
on the box of some deep-seated conditioning of suspicion and fear had been 
lifted, and I fell almost into a trance as I noticed that even the laughter of 
the broadcasters seemed to threaten me in some way I couldn't quite grasp. 
Magically, I found a show playing Gershwin and Cole Porter tunes, and with a 
certain relief I began to sing along until it struck me that since these 
composers were a Jew and a homosexual, there was even a bitter irony to be 
found right here. 
</P>
<P>
 As I drove at an enormous speed across the German countryside, I noticed two 
other things that were very disturbing. The first is that there were no 
bilboards advertising the camp. I know that a concentration camp isn't a 
tourist attraction, it isn't Disneyland or Knott's Berry Farm, and I could have 
hardly expected to see a sign saying MAUTHAUSEN -- SITE OF NAZI ATROCITIES -- 
300 KILOMETERS AHEAD, but the fact that it wasn't emphasized on the map, and 
now this lack of signs, made me wonder if there wasn't an unconscious or subtle 
conspiracy to hide it. And then there's this: As I drove hour after hour past 
the thousands and thousands of trees that line the spotless roads of Germany 
and continued on across the border into Austria, passing the checkpoint with a 
slight but noticeable flutter of the heart, I found myself descending into a 
clouded pattern of thinking that these are German, and then Austrian, trees. I 
am someone who spends a great deal of time enjoying the beauty and sanctity of 
trees wherever I travel, but here I found them curiously ominous as I realized 
that during the war I wouldn't have been able to hide safely behind one of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 When I arrived at the outskirts of the town of Mauthausen, I saw a towering 
smokestack in the distance, and I thought, "There's the place. It's the 
crematorium." I felt grim but strangely relieved that it had been left so 
exposed and that I wouldn't have to ask directions to the camp. So I drove 
through the town directly to the smokestack, which lies just alongside a 
railroad track -- images of cattle cars of human beings raced through my mind 
when I saw the tracks -- and discovered it wasn't the concentration camp after 
all, but an abandoned mill. I couldn't believe my eyes and was disappointed in 
some crazy way, because it didn't match my imagination of what the place was 
going to be. 
</P>
<P>
 So then I had to figure out where it was, or how to find it, and I drove 
around and around the town, making a point to look again at the smokestack and 
the railroad tracks, until I had to confront the next horror, which was: Just 
how do you ask someone, "Excuse me, where's the concentration camp?" And whom 
do you ask? For example, should I ask the old people I saw on the streets? And 
would they be the same people who had been there during the war? How would I 
feel then, talking to them? Because, to my surprise, I felt this combination of 
shame and embarrassment that I wanted to see the concentration camp and, at the 
same time, a deep conviction that I must see the camp, that we should all see 
it so that we can work to build a world that excludes the kind of ignorance and 
hatred and fear and brutality that led to the construction of the camps in the 
first place. 
</P>
<P>
 And so I drove around until I got the courage to ask just anyone. But it was 
like a first date, where you drive up and then you leave, and you drive up and 
then you leave again because you're just so nervous about the final 
confrontation. Finally, I pulled over to the side of a road, went into a store 
and, since I had no German, which made me pre-verbal and vulnerable, like a 
very young child, but at the same time animal-like and alert, so that my eyes 
and ears became more keen to nuance, I practiced what I was going to say. I had 
been told that the symbol for concentration camp was KZ. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the store I saw a man of about 35, a woman and two children. The woman 
was combing the long brown hair of one of the girls and the other girl was 
staring at me as I came toward them and said, in my minuscule German, " Bitte. 
Wo ist der KZ ?" I could hardly get the words out of my mouth. But this young 
man said, in English and out loud, "You want ze Conzentration Camp?" and I 
hated him, because he could say it and I couldn't. And the fact that he could 
say it made him seem callous in my eyes, because how can you even say it? How 
can you say concentration camp ? There shouldn't even be such words. 
</P>
<P>
 When I arrived at the camp, I stopped to pick up a brochure at the gate and 
began to walk around. This is the camp, I told myself. I'm walking on the 
ground where more than 200,000 people were incarcerated by the brutality of 
human ignorance, many of them dying as they were forced to hammer out the rocks 
from the rock quarry, carry them up the 186 steps -- called the Death Steps 
because thousands of prisoners were shot here -- and build the walls of the 
camp around themselves. I walked across the roll-call ground where prisoners 
were gathered and public executions were carried out and went over to the walls 
to touch the stones, almost as if I was trying to feel the human heat of the 
prisoners, their bodies, still coming through, to help the reality of the camp 
become substantial in my mind. Though that was not long in coming. 
</P>
<P>
 As I stood on the cliff overlooking the rock quarry itself, the cliff 
nicknamed Parachutists Cliff by the SS guards because it was from these heights 
that prisoners were frequently thrown over the steep face of the quarry walls, 
I heard a man's voice shouting " Komm! Komm! Schnell! Schnell! " A moment of 
sheer instinctive terror passed through me as I looked up to see a man running 
toward me. And behind him was an 8- or 9-year-old boy. They were dressed in 
identical uniforms for jogging and were heading for the treacherous task of 
running down the notorious 186 steps. The father was urging the son on. His 
voice sounded suspiciously cold and militaristic to my ears. "Do they know 
where they are?" I thought. "Do they know where they are jogging? How can they 
not know where they are ?" I twisted inside myself with anger and hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 I walked back to the main area, taking it all in, and as I made my way through 
the different barracks, the guard's quarters, the execution corner, the gas 
chamber that had been disguised as a shower room, the crematorium, something 
started to happen to me. I began to change. I started talking to myself and 
tried to walk up the sides of the walls, kicking them with the pain I felt as I 
heard my own voice in narration. "Yes, this is where they slept two and three 
to a bed, hundreds to a room. This is where they were hung by rings and beaten 
with chains during interrogation." And then I'd kick the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 I discovered in the literature available at the gate that there was one 
particular barracks where the Jews were sent. Most of the barracks were torn 
down after the Americans liberated the camp in May of 1945, but the layout I 
saw was just as it had been, and the rectangular cement foundations were still 
there. It was with a very grim and almost trance-like clarity that I thought, 
"I'm going to take my place. I'm going to go where I had to go. I'm going to 
stand where I had to stand. I'm going to sit where I had to sit and lie down 
where I had to lie down. I'm going to join my people in a way that I've never 
joined my people before." 
</P>
<P>
 I walked very slowly what felt like back to my barracks, even though I knew I 
was going there for the first time. I climbed onto the rectangle of the 
foundation and began to walk within its confines and look around. I knew that 
no matter how deeply I tried to imagine the life I might have had there as a 
prisoner, I couldn't, and I felt grateful for that. Just behind the barracks 
for Jewish prisoners stood one of the guard towers, with its gun mounts still 
intact, and there was a barbed-wire fence that had carried high voltage 
connected to the stone wall of the tower. I imagined I could see threads of 
cloth or human skin still attached to the twisted knots of wire in the fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the fence there were some trees. Actually, Mauthausen had been built on 
a beautiful site. It was one of the first things I noticed as I climbed up onto 
the foundation -- that you could wake up on a spring morning there and look 
into the distance and see the gorgeous rolling hills. I was there in May and 
the grass had begun to grow after a long winter and the hills rolled away into 
the distance with cultivated dark, rich soil. There was a perfect blue sky 
overhead. On the other side of the fence a local farmer was planting seeds. It 
was a beautiful day in Mauthausen. I even said that out loud to myself, "It's a 
beautiful day in the concentration camp." 
</P>
<P>
 But when I heard a bird singing from a tree in a nearby field, I was filled 
with this odd feeling, this new certainty, which horrified me even as the words 
formed in my mind, that nothing should be alive. Not a tree. Not one blade of 
grass. Not one of the little, yellow star-shaped weeds or flowers that grew out 
of the cracks of the foundation and all around in the soil where the barracks 
had been. Especially not these, since they seemed to mock the yellow stars the 
Jews had to wear for identification. My head began to spin with this, and I 
felt as if the whole world had been turned upside down, and now I was staring 
into a galaxy of yellow star-shaped weeds, which mocked and reminded me that in 
the very soil of this overturned universe was my own blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinarily, I would rejoice at this sign that life conquers death by 
continuing on. Nature's cycle of life, death and rebirth has always held for me 
a certain almost sacred, elegant beauty. But not today. Today I understood, as 
I never had before, that for a period the Nazis had instituted their own 
distorted version of nature, weeding out what they considered the "undesirable 
elements," and in so doing, for a time stopped time as we understand it. That 
for many peoples, the Nazis had virtually accomplished a permanent erasure, or 
as we now call it, "cleansing" from their soil. I crouched down and stared at 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes we are lucky. Sometimes the pain inside us is so severe that we 
hardly recognize ourselves, the answer I spoke of, seeking to be discovered, 
forcing the question into our minds: Is it me? Is it me with such thoughts, 
such feelings so deeply rooted inside? And this question is what wakes us up. 
For in that moment, just as I reached out a hand I hardly recognized as my own, 
so cold was it with pain and anger, to touch the little yellow tuft of one of 
those stars, I saw that the reach of the Nazis' ignorance had extended across 
all the years, across all the miles, to me. Amazing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the concentration camp called Mauthausen, 45 years after its liberation, 
another casualty to the brutality of human blindness almost occurred. How else 
could I have actually believed, even for a moment, that nature's renewal was an 
insult to life? And didn't all the fear and suspicion I had experienced on my 
journey to Mauthausen, bred by years of conditioning, years of internalizing 
the intellectual, emotional, historical, moral food of my culture, keep alive 
the kind of poisoned, unaware heart that would have led, not that long ago, to 
my own destruction? Or, at the very least, to my silently participating in the 
destruction of someone very much like me? Wasn't I, in fact, just like the boy 
being urged on by his father toward the treachery of the 186 steps? 
</P>
<P>
 As if, in my own life, I needed urging. Didn't I, at the age of 6, have my 
head smacked against the wall of my building by a German neighbor as he 
drunkenly seethed into my face, "They should have killed every one of you 
Jews!" Didn't I attempt to flee countless times from the gang of boys chasing 
me through the Bronx streets shouting, "Christ killer! Jew bastard!" as they 
surrounded me and spit into my face, held me down and punched the living 
daylights out of me? 
</P>
<P>
 It's not like the violence of bigotry was just something I had seen in movies 
or heard about at school. Didn't my personal experiences, my humiliation, my 
blood, and the blood of my people, earn me the right to hate? How easy it would 
have been -- how perfectly natural in that moment -- for me to justify every 
thought and feeling I had experienced on my journey that day. But if I had, 
that justification would be like the crack of a rifle shot. The head falling, 
my own. 
</P>
<P>
 SO I MADE A VOW -- THAT I would take on the responsibility, in my own life, to 
start time. Certainly we must grieve for the victims and do all we can to 
resist the tyranny of hatred and ignorance. I'm not for a moment proposing that 
actions based on such ignorance should be condoned. To understand is not to 
justify or excuse. But we must look deeply within ourselves for the causes of 
such ignorance and its extension into action or we run the risk of losing 
ourselves in the process of opposition and becoming the very enemy we oppose. 
</P>
<P>
 It's just too easy to justify our own hatred, fear and prejudice toward an 
entire people, to identify them as other in our minds. And, with the rapidity 
and repetition of images offered by the media, it is difficult to resist 
generalizing the actions of a few members of a group into a more globalized 
expectation and version of that group as a whole. (I wonder how many people in 
our city thought or heard totally unfounded rumors from others, as I did, that 
it must have been a gang initiation that started the recent fires in the Santa 
Monica Mountains? How many of us felt that the death and destruction there was 
of no real consequence because it was happening in someone else's neighborhood? 
How many felt that way about the eruption more than a year ago in the 
neighborhood called South-Central? How many of us felt, in both cases, it was 
to be expected, or even deserved? Because the people there are other. Not our 
group, not our kind, not our tribe, not ourselves.) 
</P>
<P>
 The diversity and multi-ethnicity of Los Angeles give it the potential to lead 
our nation as a city of the future. But the word diversity does not apply only 
to the city in which we make our lives. Within each one of us there is a 
diversity of voices, a multiplicity of hopes, needs, fears, strengths common to 
all people. The internal voices we ultimately listen to are the ones that grow 
strongest within us, the ones we nurture most. If we nurture our awareness with 
the radical acknowledgment that as human beings we are capable of blindness and 
the subtle and overt actions that flow from such blindness, in that moment we 
break the lock our own ignorance holds upon us and create real hope for change. 
 
</P>
<P>
 But if we continue to believe it is always someone else's anger, someone 
else's fear, someone else wreaking havoc in the streets of our city, and in so 
doing push the root of so many problems away and disconnect it from ourselves, 
believing there is an absolute discontinuity between how we live our lives and 
how they live theirs, how will we be able to get our hands on it? How will we 
study this rooted unawareness up close so we may come to understand it well 
enough to make the necessary transformation? Far from wanting it out of our 
hands, we must place it squarely there so we can cease to inflame our own 
wrongheadedness and build a future, a diamond from coal, a lotus growing out of 
the mud.

GREETINGS FROM LOVELINESSLAND; A LOOK AT THE LATEST TREATMENTS -- KITTY LITTER 
FACIALS, AND POLISHINGS AND AROMA TANNING -- REVEALS THAT MORE IS MORE IN THE 
BEAUTY BIZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 So the Southern California real estate market is in the toilet, we've lost 
Star Wars, and the B-2 bomber and the C-17 are hanging by a thread. Relax, 
we've still got the beauty biz. The Cold War may be over, but there's no truce 
in the war against clogged pores, drab hair and chipped polish. 
</P>
<P>
 Take my beauty regimen -- please. I used to get my hair cut at a funky little 
shop around the corner from my house. Now I go to the largest salon in 
California: Umberto, a 12,000-square-foot Beverly Hills shrine, complete with a 
cappuccino bar and costume jewelry boutique, where in addition to offering the 
usual cuts, color, perms, manicures, pedicures and facials, they will bleach a 
woman's arm hair or wax a man's ears. For this extravagance, I blame my mother, 
the Manhattan Beauty Maven. When I decided to cut off my long hair, she gave me 
Umberto's name. For under three figures, he gave me a cut so sensational that 
even my notoriously frugal husband urged me to return. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that I needed much prodding. Visiting le grand salon is like going to an 
opulent theme park -- LovelinessLand! -- where any physical imperfection can be 
repaired and the raison d'etre is to pamper me. The sheer excess is 
mind-boggling; from the faux Pompeian frescoes over the reception desk to 
trompe l'oeil wood beams on the shampoo room's ceiling. Sixty-five 
hairdressers, five colorists, 14 manicurists, three facialists, five makeup 
artists and a scalp-treatment specialist are all decked out in the beauty 
version of Mickey and Goofy costumes -- black, avant-garde ensembles straight 
out of Elle or Details. They perform magical transformations in 18 rooms, five 
private suites and endless nooks and crannies. I am given to understand (from a 
press release) that my fellow pilgrims include Madonna, Shannen Doherty, Janet 
Jackson, Cher, Sylvester Stallone, Sharon Stone and Winona Ryder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figure we have around 600 clients a day, five days a week, who spend an 
average of $100," said Babette Beja, salon manager. 
</P>
<P>
 I figure it's more than that, since the shop has sly ways of getting you to 
spend money. For instance, if an assistant graciously offers you a Diet Coke 
and you gratefully accept, it later appears on your bill. When my hair was 
still long, a stylist put it up in a spectacular chignon. I was charged $1.50 
for every fancy bobby pin she used (luckily, I passed on the $79jeweled 
chopsticks in the boutique). And, of course, each operator favors a different 
miracle hair glop, and the salon carries them all. Retail glop sales alone 
probably cover the monthly rent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Soon a woman will be able to walk out with a fantastic pasta primavera for 
six to take home for dinner," promises the courtly Umberto, who is installing a 
" tutto Italiano" kitchen next door to his salon. If this seems excessive, over 
at 2 Rodeo, Jose Eber and his partner, the oh-so-fabulously-French Laurent 
Dufourg, have spent more than a million dollars on a 10,000-square-foot 
neo-Rococo temple which is open seven days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 PERHAPS MORE IS MORE IN THE BEAUTY BIZ BECAUSE THERE'S SO MUCH competition. In 
Beverly Hills' 1.2-mile golden triangle between Wilshire, Santa Monica and 
Robertson boulevards, there are more than 208 licensed hair, skin and 
body-beautifying businesses. And Beverly Hills has no monopoly; beauty 
transcends social, cultural and economic boundaries. In 1992, Southern 
California's resources included 51,588 manicurists, 1,434 electrologists, 5,392 
cosmeticians and 112,816 cosmetologists (this includes hairdressers) -- more 
than 10% of the national total pampering less than 5% of the nation's 
population. Salons in Los Angeles County made more than $100 million in hair 
and nail care alone. Nationally, salon services were projected to gross $35.5 
billion last year with $4.5 billion coming from nails alone. 
</P>
<P>
 And to think I went to college instead of beauty school. 
</P>
<P>
 The business is not entirely recession proof, according to another Beverly 
Hills hair-meister. "Clients don't come in every third week like they used to," 
said Giuseppe Franco, whose press kit, with winning understatement, bills him 
as "the most famous hairdresser in the world." "They make their color last 
until the last second. When they have black roots and blond hair, then they 
come." Why not skip it entirely? "If you want to live in L.A., you have to keep 
up the image." 
</P>
<P>
 "In boom times, a salon owner could open 15 or 20 locations," said Mary 
Atherton, editor of Modern Salon, a glossy, Illinois-based magazine with 
articles like "How To Pitch Perms to a Reluctant Client." "But now rents are 
prohibitive. And a lot of people are deciding to make the one salon that they 
have truly spectacular. To survive, you have to have as many people as possible 
come through the door. So you add more services." 
</P>
<P>
 There are certainly enough to choose from: body sugaring (a variation on 
waxing), sports pedicures, thermal seaweed wraps, scalp facials, full body mud 
masques and watsu massage, a form of shiatsu performed in a swimming pool that 
is supposed to make you feel like you returned to the womb (how would you 
know?). My vote for most eccentric is Nail Art (whose patron saint, according 
to the remarkably thick and informative Nails magazine, is Olympic track star 
Florence Griffith Joyner). For $30, a nail artist will paint Elvis, or your 
grandchild, or a scene from "Star Trek" on your nail. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's aromatherapy, which, depending on your olfactory nerves, is the 
greatest healing force or biggest gimmick of the '90s. Proponents claim that a 
whiff of oils -- mimosa, patchouli, peppermint, rose -- can do everything from 
opening the heart chakra to sharpening the wits to aiding sleep. A person 
wishing to inhale her way to greater health and happiness can indulge in 
aromatherapy facials, massages, pedicures, scalp treatments, even Aroma 
Tanning, where you lie on an air-cooled UV bed and are basted with lavender. 
</P>
<P>
 "The body responds to scent without any intellectual barriers," said Susan 
Dworski, export manager for Aroma Vera, which claims to be the nation's largest 
manufacturer of essential-oil-based products. Last year, the L.A. company sold 
660 pounds of lavender, 1,100 pounds of eucalyptus, 660 pounds of ylang-ylang, 
and a ton of petit grain, an oil obtained from the bitter orange tree. They 
have yet to market the smell of money, though perhaps they should. She told me 
the Las Vegas Hilton recently pumped a blend of essential oils into the slot 
machine area of the casino. Fragrant one-armed bandits collected 45% more.  
</P>
<P>
 But who am I to judge what's beneficial? Recently, I indulged in a "Salt Glo" 
treatment at Burke Williams, a lavish day spa in Santa Monica. I was nonplussed 
when Frank, a hunk with a towel around his waist, led me to a "wet room," a 
large shower with a massage table. He instructed me to lie face down, stark 
naked, with just a teensy towel for modesty, then tossed sea salt on me as if I 
were an icy driveway. "The Egyptians called this aura polishing," Frank 
explained as he scraped my hull. He claimed to be exfoliating and detoxifying, 
two of the many beauty verbs I view with suspicion. Whatever, it was fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wouldn't believe the people I've salted," Frank said as he turned on the 
shower to rinse me off. When pressed for specifics, he named cast members of 
"Sister Act II." 
</P>
<P>
 Name dropping is rarely accidental. Salons boast of movie star patronage the 
way English businesses flaunt the Royal Warrant (By Appointment to Her Majesty, 
etc.). Almost every establishment I visited offered me a list of celebrity 
clients, all the while insisting that they provide complete discretion. 
</P>
<P>
 Franco has even decorated his Beverly Hills salon with huge photos of clients 
such as Tony Curtis and Iman that were taken by "my childhood friend and 
business partner, Mickey Rourke." But he assured me, with a straight face, "I 
don't brag about them. You know how many TV shows don't accept me unless I go 
on and gossip? I lose a show a month. I've done Montel Williams, Vicki 
Lawrence, this is my fifth time. But I don't say, 'So and so's hair is so 
thin.' So I can't do 'Arsenio' and 'A Current Affair.' " (Not to worry. Barbra 
Streisand is also a client. And look where her former hairdresser, Jon Peters, 
wound up.) 
</P>
<P>
 The Beauty Barons don't just do stars, they are stars, who endlessly promote 
with books, talk shows and infomercials. Superstylist Jose Eber got his big 
break when he created Farrah Fawcett's widely copied shag in the late '70s. 
Today, his star client is Elizabeth Taylor but not, as the tabloids recently 
suggested, Sugar, Taylor's Maltese. "You know how that got started?" Eber 
laughed. "We were shooting a commercial. Elizabeth was on camera and she asked, 
'How's Sugar's hair?' I said, 'It looks fine.' Maybe I took the brush and ran 
through it. But I didn't tease. Sugar isn't coming to me on a monthly basis." 
</P>
<P>
 Just give her time. "The one thing women are looking for is to feel good about 
themselves, to like what they see," said Eber. "I make them feel good and that 
gives them great confidence. That's what it's all about, the beauty business. 
It's not as superficial as people think." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Cadow, a USC psychology instructor, agreed. "It's actually a cheap way 
to do therapy," she said. "Women have a constant complaint: They're not getting 
attention from the men in their life. They go have a facial, have a massage, 
get their hair colored. In the excitement of having someone pay attention to 
you, gushing over you, you feel better. It's all about taking care of 
yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Does anyone really need this much care? Recently, I drove to Encino for a 
90-minute Royal Pedicure at A Place For You, a nail tabernacle so clean they 
could perform surgery on the floor. (According to Nails magazine, sanitation is 
a big selling point because it's the only way posh salons can compete with the 
discount shops.) Donna Marone, the manicurist, or as Nails prefers, the nail 
technician, installed me on an elevated throne in the "Pedicure Palace" and did 
everything to my toes except play this little piggy goes to market. But after a 
seaweed sloughing treatment, reflexology massage and hot paraffin wax mask, I 
was homicidal from inactivity. I was proud of my crimson toes, for at least 
five minutes. Then I went to a market in thongs and was run over by a faulty 
cart. 
</P>
<P>
 Time for a retouch?  
</P>
<P>
 "PEOPLE NEED A PLACE TO GO TO HEAL FROM THE TROUBLED WORLD AND the salon has 
become that place," said Jody Byrne, president of Trends and Sources 
International, an Ohio company that forecasts beauty trends. "I looked up the 
definition of a sacred place and it's one where a prescribed ritual transforms 
an individual. That's what the day spa movement is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 Striking a less spiritual chord, she noted: "Baby Boomers are hitting middle 
age. They have the most money and at the same time, their body is going south 
at the fastest rate." Another expert blames our obsession with appearance on 
evolution. "Go down to the L.A. Zoo and watch the gorillas," said Norman Freed, 
a psychologist who specializes in the beauty industry. "Gorillas use grooming 
for bonding, as an opportunity for interfacing, and as an opportunity to settle 
disputes." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps this explains why beauty has become such a popular social activity. 
Friends who used to go to lunch and a movie now hang out at the day spa. 
Mothers and daughters have warm fuzzy memories of shared facials. Just ask 
Hillary Rodham Clinton and daughter Chelsea, who allegedly (wink/nudge: I have 
sworn not to reveal my sources) get their pores steamed at Georgette Klinger 
Inc., a national chain of tony salons. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have such hectic lives. To have a place you can relax, where no one 
can call you -- that's important," said president Kathryn Klinger, who had her 
first facial when she was 11 and grew up playing with her mother's products. 
She estimates her average customer spends $100 a visit. "Of course, we have 
clients who spend $20,000 a year, who come with their entire families every 
single week." 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange, they get a sense of physical, if not fiscal, control. The morning 
before my $68 "basic facial" I awoke with an enormous blemish. "I give your 
pimple special treatment," promised Miss Faina, the Russian aesthetician at 
Georgette Klinger on Rodeo, dabbing a camphor mask on the spot. While it was 
drying, I asked how beauty services in L.A. compared to those in the former 
Soviet Union. "Women there have facials all the time," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 An hour later, my skin was practically healed and radiant. However, if I 
wanted to keep it that way, Miss Faina recommended that I invest in a 
half-dozen products (average price, $22 each) and a monthly Line Essential 
Facial ($98 for my "older skin"). I was reminded of a soothsayer I once met in 
El Retiro, Madrid's version of Central Park. She told me that there was a curse 
on me, then offered to remove it for $5.  
</P>
<P>
 I often thought about that soothsayer during my tour of LovelinessLand. The 
curse on me varied from blond eyelashes to chapped hands to bitten fingernails. 
But a solution could always be found if I crossed a palm with cash. Not all of 
these solutions are expensive, but they are habit forming. Start with a simple 
manicure, hair cut and occasional facial, and pretty soon your schedule is 
overrun with lash tints, highlights, low lights, fiberglass nail overlays, hair 
relaxers and whatever else is written up in this month's issue of Allure. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these techniques work, so it's hard to know where to draw the line. 
Technology has finally caught up with vanity. A woman can now buy a perfect set 
of sculpted unpolished nails, waist-length hair extensions, or smoother skin in 
one hour, thanks to a glycolic acid peel. And that's not counting the shopping 
list available through plastic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of which, I went to Christophe (the salon that rushed to President 
Clinton's rescue on the LAX runway) for a non-surgical Electro-Myopulse 
face-lift. A soft-spoken woman in a turban named Ram Prakash (which in the Sikh 
spiritual language means rejuvenator of Farrah Fawcett, I mean, Radiance of 
God) handed me a mirror and asked a daunting question, "Which side of your face 
is showing the most signs of age?" 
</P>
<P>
 I reluctantly guessed the left. "I would have said the right," said Prakash, 
pointing out lines, wrinkles and folds that I naively had attributed to lack of 
sleep. I lay down and she ran her magic cell-rejuvenating wand over the left 
side of my face. Supposedly the electrical current was opening the meridians in 
my face, like acupuncture. I felt nothing but a tingling sensation and mounting 
skepticism. Then she handed me a mirror. To my astonishment, the treated side 
was an inch higher. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are going to do the other side?" I asked nervously. 
</P>
<P>
 An hour later, I beheld a face I hadn't seen in several years. Prakash said 
the $45 treatment would last anywhere from an hour to a week. "It takes a few 
treatments before your face sticks," she explained. 
</P>
<P>
 My husband's reaction? "Honey, you look like you've been sandblasted." But a 
girlfriend was impressed. The results lasted three days and I'm longing for a 
pick-me-up. But I am trying to remain strong. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, I have plenty of stuff to try at home. Prakash recommended that I 
bathe in four cups of cider vinegar and water, which will leave my skin as 
smooth as a baby's bottom (the universal benchmark for softness). I'm afraid 
I'll smell like an Easter egg. Then again, at least I've heard of vinegar.  
</P>
<P>
 Reading a list of product ingredients these days requires an advanced degree 
in alchemy. A random sampling of cosmetic ingredients includes: DNA extracted 
from salmon milt, cactine, silk amino acids, salicylic acid from willow bark, 
blackthorn oil, hydrolyzed human hair keratin protein, frozen seaweed extract 
and St. John's wort oil. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's exotic about wort oil? It's used for topical healing," said Jane 
Kennedy, owner of Palmetto, a Santa Monica boutique overflowing with virtually 
every fragrant soap, cream and holistic skin-care line on the planet. "Exotic 
to me would be some unbelievable oils with East Indian attars of sunflower and 
gardenia and night-blooming jasmine. Not common calendula or mallow." 
</P>
<P>
 Even further out there was Riquette Hofstein, a Beverly Hills aesthetician 
whose biggest claim to fame is that she's demonstrated her kitchen cosmetics on 
David Letterman's show 17 times. "I teach people how they can take everything 
they eat and drink and turn it into beauty products," Hofstein said. "Did you 
know that you can put a pound of kitty litter in the blender -- before kitty 
gets to it, of course -- and add water and apply it as a mask on your face?" 
And then there was her recipe for canker sores: "Drink urine. Heal the body 
with its own astringent." 
</P>
<P>
 Pass the salmon milt DNA, please. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, while the lords and ladies of LovelinessLand can make you gorgeous and 
give you confidence, it's dangerous to get too dependent. The gods must have 
known I was researching this article because my beauty karma has gone out of 
whack. Umberto decided to give me a new look and got a wee bit scissors happy. 
Friends who formerly regarded my hair with envy now look at me with transparent 
Schadenfreude and utter four of the saddest words in the English language: "It 
will grow back." To make matters worse, I went to a neighborhood shop and had 
my blond eyebrows tinted with vegetable dye. They turned out a garish brownish 
black. Meanwhile, my over-cleansed skin is breaking out from one too many 
miracle preparations. And I reek of lavender. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm taking this all as a sign that I must quit dwelling on my appearance and 
focus on a more spiritually fulfilling endeavor. And I will. I promise. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as soon as that woman in the turban gives me one more face-lift.

 ROLE REVERSAL: Criminal attorney Leonard R. Milstein has found himself on the 
other side of the defense table. The former Woodland Hills resident is accused 
of arranging for a jail inmate to give false testimony on behalf of a client 
facing a murder charge . . . Milstein gained prominence in the 1980s as 
chairman of a group that circulated petitions calling for San Fernando Valley 
schools to leave the Los Angeles district. (B1) 
</P>
<P>
 ODD CALLING: When Maury, Geraldo, Oprah or another talk show needs an out of 
the ordinary guest, they call Chris Darryn of Encino. After years of trying to 
make it in show biz himself, Darryn became an agent of the weird and the odd by 
founding the National Talk Show Guest Registry . . . The registry has 1,800 
people with unlikely claims to fame, including a Burbank woman who recycles 
garbage into clothing and decorations. (B1) 
</P>
<P>
 PAJAMA PARTY: Women like Carol Convey, above, arrive in flannel pajamas and 
grown men show up in their Dr. Dentons once a month at Cafe 50's, a normally 
sedate diner in Sherman Oaks. That's because the establishment offers free 
meals to patrons who show up in traditional night clothes. . . . Sweats or 
thermal underwear won't cut it. And sexy negligees are strictly banned. (B1) 
</P>
<P>
 LAWS OF THE LAND: Sometimes laws take long, complicated journeys before they 
actually become laws, while others follow relatively straight paths . . . A new 
law that prohibits the sale of knives or other stabbing weapons to anyone 
younger than 18 was brought to Councilman Hal Bernson by a woman in his 
northwest Valley district whose 13-year-old son had purchased three knives from 
a local store. (B2)

 MENTAL EXERCISE: Patients in a Palmdale mental health program are working out 
life's problems while teetering on a high wire or swinging from a trapeze. The 
program's obstacle course uses 17 challenges from ropes to telephone poles and 
works as a catalyst for patients to break through roadblocks. (B16)

HISPANIOLA TO NEW YORK STREETS: IMMIGRANT DREAMS GONE AWRY; NARCOTICS: WOULD-BE 
DRUG DEALERS TAKE A DEADLY PATH BETWEEN DOMINICAN REPUBLIC AND WASHINGTON 
HEIGHTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA KENNEDY, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The streets of Washington Heights are not paved with gold -- they teem with 
drugs and violence. But certain young men in the Dominican Republic, 1,600 
miles away, will risk their lives to come here. 
</P>
<P>
 Their vision of the immigrant American Dream is to amass a fortune by selling 
drugs, primarily cocaine. Their violent ways overshadow the lives of thousands 
of Dominicans who hold legitimate jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're entrepreneurs and they'll kill you just as soon as look at you if you 
walk on their turf," said Detective Jerry Giorgio of the 34th Precinct, which 
covers the neighborhood at the northern end of Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids come here and find out how lucrative selling drugs can be. They 
send a message back down to the D.R. -- you may not live past the age of 22, 
but you'll live like a king." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last decade, Dominicans have established a thriving cocaine trade 
worth hundreds of millions of dollars annually, according to federal law 
enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
 After Dominicans expanded into heroin two years ago, the FBI formed a special 
investigative squad targeting Washington Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the violence that brought us in to look at this," said Charles Domroe, 
who oversees the squad. "The Colombians and the Asians are bigger traffickers, 
but none of them are as violent as the Dominicans. The drugs up there have 
destroyed whole neighborhoods and created so much fear." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, there were fewer than 100,000 Dominicans in Washington Heights; now 
there are more than 350,000. Crime has risen sharply, especially since crack 
cocaine hit in 1985. Homicides in the "three-four" went from 57 in 1987 to 122 
in 1991, topping every other precinct in the city. In 1992, there were 98 -- 
also the highest in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1985, more than 400 young Dominicans from one town -- San Francisco de 
Macoris -- have been killed in the United States, most in drug-related murders 
in New York. To say nothing of the lives that have been ruined. 
</P>
<P>
 "Follow me," said a painfully thin, Dominican-born woman named Maria. She 
walked up the steps of a once elegant brownstone and knocked at an apartment at 
the end of a dank hallway. 
</P>
<P>
 The door swung open. The silhouettes of three people could be seen slumped on 
couches in almost total darkness. A lamp with a bare bulb was hauled out to 
illuminate a tiny living room with a battered coffee table littered with crack 
paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more you smoke, the more you want," said Maria, as she pulled out a knife 
and began cutting the crack on a mirror on the table. It was a little after 
4:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 As Maria heated the crack in a tiny metal pitcher, the two women and a man 
seated on shabby sofas watched in a polite stupor, as if she were preparing 
afternoon tea. 
</P>
<P>
 The room was quiet except for the hissing sound as Maria lit her pipe and 
passed it around. Most other like her turn to prostitution, she said, but not 
her -- she cleans rooms for drug dealers in exchange for drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of Dominican Mafia-like family organizations control drug operations in 
the Heights, according to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug dealers have taken over whole blocks, particularly at the southern and 
northern tips of the area, scaring people away from even using pay telephones. 
Cars are routinely double- and triple-parked on most streets, and salsa music 
blares night and day on expensive car stereo systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Young men stand in front of the buildings steering "clients" from cars with 
New Jersey, Connecticut and Pennsylvania license plates into apartments bare 
except for couches, tables and drug scales. 
</P>
<P>
 At $30 to $40 a gram, the cocaine in Washington Heights is a bargain, 
especially for out-of-state customers who might pay up to $20 more per gram 
where they live. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have had some success targeting the white suburbanites; more than 300 
cars have been seized and 400 people arrested during periodic sweeps at the 
George Washington Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 But stymied by a lack of cooperation from Heights residents, authorities have 
had less success in cracking down on violence and drug-dealing in the Heights 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a homicide investigation, nobody saw nothing," said Giorgio, the 
detective. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie, 24, a 10th-grade dropout and street-level drug dealer, works the area 
around 162nd Street and Broadway. He said he usually has a stash of about 200 
grams of crack in the apartments he uses. 
</P>
<P>
 "You gotta be out here seven days a week to make money," said Eddie, who did 
not want his Spanish name used. On a typical night he can make up to $1,000, he 
said, "It's all about not getting caught. You just want to survive another 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The words "ENVIOS DE DINERO" cover the windows of the dozens of travel 
agencies in the area, meaning they send money back to the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the drug profits are sent back or reinvested in cocaine. Dominicans 
buy from the Colombians, acting as wholesale retailers, said the FBI's Domroe. 
</P>
<P>
 Both street-level dealers and kingpins commute between the two countries, 
federal officials say. Unlike the immigrants of yore, many Dominicans dislike 
New York and sell drugs here in the hope of retiring as millionaires in their 
homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafael, 20, a drug dealer who would not give his last name, stood on the 
corner of 163rd Street and Broadway one night, his eyes red from the effects of 
the same cocaine he sells. 
</P>
<P>
 He was dressed in a white linen blazer from the Gap, Calvin Klein jeans and 
Timberland shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a tropical Sicily," Rafael said dreamily, describing his hometown. 
"You can do anything you want down there, go to the social clubs, go swimming, 
play pool, gamble. I just want to make enough money here to go home and never 
come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-three-year-old James (Kiko) Garcia did return to the Dominican Republic 
permanently, although not in the way he planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Garcia was involved with drugs; his family and neighbors said 
he worked in a grocery store. In July, 1991, Garcia was killed by police, 
setting off six days of rioting in Washington Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia's family took him home to bury him. Then they returned to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 When Regina Garcia, Kiko's 59-year-old mother, lived in San Francisco de 
Macoris, she made about $10 per month cleaning rooms in a school. Now she makes 
$216 a week working in a factory in Hackensack, N.J., enough to rent a 
two-bedroom apartment with four other sons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to stay here," she said, "because there's no other way to support my 
family."

 PACKING THE COURT: A lot of your co-workers getting called for jury duty? It's 
the result of the county's new jury system, which in 1993 more than doubled the 
number summoned the previous year. The trade-off is you don't have to serve up 
to a month. In fact, most only serve one day. Now Superior Court administrator 
Alan Slater is sending out letters to businesses, appealing to them to help 
even more by being more generous in providing paid leave for workers on jury 
duty. 
</P>
<P>
 WAKE UP CALL: If you are chosen to serve on a jury, you'll start your work day 
at 9 a.m. -- unless you're in Superior Court Judge William F. Rylaarsdam's 
courtroom. Rylaarsdam's jurors arrive at 8 a.m. -- and not a minute late. But 
he runs his court without a lunch hour, so his jurors' day ends at 1 p.m., 
while those in other courtrooms stay until 4:30 p.m. . . . Says Rylaarsdam, now 
on temporary assignment with the 4th District Court of Appeal: "My jurors tell 
me later that they really like those hours."

 RAM OR LAMB? Fast food magnate Carl Karcher, embroiled in a battle with his 
own board, had been scheduled for weeks to appear today on Dick Kazan's KABC 
call-in radio talk show. But mid-week Kazan got the word: Karcher did not want 
to cancel , just postpone . Karcher is involved in delicate negotiations with 
the board over his contract. Says Kazan: "If they agree, he'll come on to say 
how great things are. If they don't, he may use my show for a battering ram." 
</P>
<P>
 CLUTTERED MINDS? Do you work with folks whose desks are so piled with clutter 
they can't see their desktop? And they always say, "But I know where everything 
is." Dan Songer of Priority Management, an Irvine consulting firm, says about 
them: "They're kidding themselves -- and they know it." Monday is "National 
Clean Off Your Desk Day" in the business world. Songer suggests it be taken 
seriously: "The average office worker spends 36 minutes a day just looking for 
things on the desk." Answering the Call 
</P>

 The county's new jury system doubled the number of people summoned to serve 
last year (In thousands). '93*: 585

BABY-SWITCH ORDEAL IS STILL UNRESOLVED AFTER 41 YEARS; MICHIGAN: NURSE'S ERROR 
IN 1952 GAVE TWO NEIGHBORING COUPLES THE WRONG SONS. THE RESULT HAS BEEN 
DECADES OF DISBELIEF, ACRIMONY, COURT BATTLES.

 When neighbors Janet Lord and Ellen Laisure arrived at the hospital, both 
about to give birth, hospital workers marveled at the coincidence and placed 
them in the same room. 
</P>
<P>
 That coincidence on New Year's Eve, 1952, changed both families' lives 
forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours after the women were admitted to Gerber Memorial Hospital in Fremont, 
Mich., the same doctor scurried between the deliveries of Leon Lord and Timothy 
John Laisure. 
</P>
<P>
 A nurse placed name tags near the table where the newborns were cleaned. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when it happened," said Janet Lord's husband, Earl. "She put the wrong 
tags on the babies. The first baby my wife saw was the baby we raised. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was not our child." 
</P>
<P>
 After the births, Lord returned to military duty in Florida. His wife and the 
baby moved in with his family, across the street from the Laisures in the small 
town of Grant, Mich. The families visited frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Laisures were dark-complexioned and so was their first son, then a 
toddler. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here they had the new baby who was strawberry-blond, blue-eyed and very 
fair," Earl Lord told the Muskegon Chronicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, the Lords -- blond, blue-eyed and fair-skinned -- were rearing a boy 
with dark eyes, dark hair and dark complexion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ellen made comments jokingly that they must've mixed the kids up," Lord said. 
"But Janet and her mother didn't believe it. They dropped it." 
</P>
<P>
 When Lord returned home from the Air Force in 1955 and saw his son, then 
almost 3, "I could see the difference right away," he said. "I wanted my own 
son." 
</P>
<P>
 Lord took his family to a Grand Rapids hospital for blood tests and doctors 
discovered the toddler they were rearing could not possibly be their biological 
son. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to talk with the Laisures resulted only in disbelief and acrimony, 
Lord said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't talked to them since," said Lord, now 63 and living in Twin Lake, 
Mich. "There's been an understanding, or truce." 
</P>
<P>
 The Laisures, who still live in Grant, say the incident is better off 
forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happened very many years ago," said Ora Laisure, Ellen's husband. "It's 
very emotional. I don't understand why this is coming up now." 
</P>
<P>
 Lord explained the mix-up to Leon when he was 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lee told me he always felt there was something, but he couldn't put his 
finger on it," Lord said. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Lord told Timothy Laisure in 1972, when he announced his engagement. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had no idea," Lord said. "He broke down and cried. Janet felt he and his 
bride had a right to know." 
</P>
<P>
 The boys declined to talk at length, saying the topic remains too painful for 
the Laisures. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got my name and I got his," said Timothy Laisure. "I'm always going to 
be a Lord, but I've been a Laisure for 40 years. I have no intention of 
changing my name, and I don't think Lee does either." 
</P>
<P>
 Lord eventually contacted a lawyer, but a state law at the time prevented 
lawsuits against nonprofit corporations. He and the hospital settled for $1,548 
in February, 1960. Lord said he agreed because the family needed the cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital spokesman David Hewitt said records show that the hospital never 
admitted any wrongdoing. He said none of the hospital's current staff had been 
at the hospital long enough to have firsthand knowledge of the case and records 
don't show the name of the attending nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 Lord, whose wife died in 1978 after they had three more children, said he felt 
compelled to tell his story because of guilt that he didn't do enough to 
correct the mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want people to know what happened, and I want my grandchildren -- both sets 
-- to know their heritage. This has been swept under the table for years."

DIPLOMATIC SCOFFLAWS TOLD TO PAY PARKING TICKETS OR LOSE AID; IMMUNITY: FOR 
YEARS, MOST ENVOYS, FAMILIES AND STAFFS HAVE ASSUMED THAT TRAFFIC LAWS DID NOT 
APPLY TO THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A blue Chevrolet glides to a stop in a downtown bus zone. The driver, a neatly 
dressed man in a dark suit, nods at the city parking-enforcement aide handing 
out tickets and walks into the Russian Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
 Meter enforcer Charles Combs nods back and slaps a $50 ticket on the Chevy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next half-hour, Combs will give out nearly $300 worth of tickets to 
illegally parked embassy cars. It is a routine that Combs follows with little 
variation, even though until recently he's known that the chances of the 
embassy ever paying the fines have been remote. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just doing my job," he says. "It's up to somebody else to collect them." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, most diplomats, their families and staffs have operated in the 
United States on the assumption that diplomatic immunity means never having to 
pay a parking ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington's Department of Transportation figures the city is owed roughly $6 
million in fines and penalties for unpaid tickets handed out to vehicles from 
more than 160 embassies over the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 New York City police last year plastered 133,227 tickets on cars from foreign 
consulates and United Nations missions, only to see 94% of the citations 
dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 But the balance of power in this standoff is being tipped. Congress recently 
directed that a portion of U.S. foreign aid be withheld from countries that 
ignore parking fines, and the State Department announced a plan to revoke the 
official license plates of diplomatic scofflaws. 
</P>
<P>
 By far the leading culprits are the countries of the former Soviet Union. As 
of last July, their representatives in Washington had ignored 73,797 tickets, 
carrying fines of nearly $3.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Five other Washington embassies have more than 1,000 outstanding tickets: 
Nigeria, Egypt, South Korea, Zimbabwe and India. Thirteen others have more than 
500 each. The worst single offender in New York is a car registered to 
Nicaragua, which had accumulated 293 tickets at last count. 
</P>
<P>
 "Driving is a privilege, not a right, no matter what country the driver comes 
from," insists Joseph DePlasco, a spokesman for the New York Department of 
Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 New York's commissioner of transportation, Lucius Riccio, puts it more 
bluntly: "The 'free' in the Free World does not refer to parking." 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign embassies do not see things the same way. Russians complain that they 
have only five spaces reserved on the street in front of their embassy not far 
from the White House, but about 40 cars to park each day. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Moscow," Russian Embassy spokesman Vladimir Derbenev said, "the American 
Embassy has a free parking lot and the police do not give tickets to diplomats' 
cars." 
</P>
<P>
 Caught in this cross-fire is the U.S. State Department. 
</P>
<P>
 It is sympathetic to the problems of hard-pressed local authorities and is 
trying to help them collect the overdue fines. At the same time, it recognizes 
the importance of diplomatic immunity, the principle that provides 
representatives of foreign governments freedom from criminal prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is essential for diplomats to be able to function without fear of 
harassment or consequences," explains a State Department official. "They need 
this protection to communicate freely -- about trade, war and peace, every 
conceivable matter." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. envoys receive reciprocal protection in their overseas posts, although 
the State Department expects them to pay their own parking tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 The principle of diplomatic immunity is rooted "deep in antiquity," according 
to Peter P. Hill, professor of history and a specialist in international 
affairs at George Washington University in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "When kings sent emissaries, they wanted them to be secure. An ambassador 
should be immune from any local legislation that would inhibit conducting his 
country's business with another government." 
</P>
<P>
 The Vienna Convention of 1961, which codified the rules of diplomacy for the 
first time, says that diplomats are supposed to obey the laws of the countries 
where they work, but makes them largely immune from arrest or prosecution if 
they don't. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the diplomatic community in the United States have gone free after 
being accused of shoplifting, rape, a nightclub shooting and other felonies, 
although in many of those instances, they have also left the country. 
</P>
<P>
 No one is going to be declared persona non grata for ignoring parking tickets. 
But as the number of offenses soars, so does public irritation, along with 
demands to do something. New Yorkers have applauded as tow trucks hauled off 
illegally parked diplomatic cars that blocked traffic or posed a "health and 
safety hazard" at a fire hydrant or bus stop. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department, embassy representatives and local officials have tried 
for years to find a compromise to the parking dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations finally produced a plan under which the State Department will 
revoke the official red, white and blue diplomatic license plates of countries 
that don't pay their fines. Expected to go into effect early this year, the 
strategy is welcomed by both Washington and New York officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a timely and effective way of collecting fines," said Richard Hebert of 
the D.C. Department of Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) complains that the proposal is "like flogging 
(diplomatic scofflaws) with a wet noodle." Helms co-sponsored the law that 
calls for reducing U.S. foreign assistance to any country with unpaid parking 
tickets. The cut in aid would equal the amount the foreign government owed in 
overdue fines, plus a 10% penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics point out that this applies only to Washington parking fines and will 
be useful only against countries that receive U.S. aid. In addition, they worry 
about retaliation. A few years ago, when D.C. police started a parking 
crackdown, a squad of motorcycle policemen in Manila ticketed 87 Americans in 
one day for moving violations near the U.S. Embassy to the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the new law took effect, one major scofflaw country, Israel, has paid 
off its debt. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief target of the law, Russia, has not. But, noting that "our countries 
are friends now, so we should resolve this in a friendly way," Derbenev said 
his embassy is ready to help find a diplomatic solution to this undiplomatic 
squabble.

NEW LAW AIMS TO BOOST INSTITUTIONAL SENSITIVITIES TO DISABLED INMATES; PRISONS: 
BUT ALLEGATIONS OF ABUSE PERSIST. AND LONGER SENTENCES WILL BOOST POPULATION OF 
OLDER, AILING PEOPLE.

 Peter Grassia, a convicted robber, walked into the New York prison system 
three years ago but is not likely to walk out. Another prisoner at the Rikers 
Island facility in New York City knifed him in the back shortly after his 
arrest, paralyzing Grassia below the waist. 
</P>
<P>
 By Grassia's account, which prison authorities strongly dispute, any hope that 
his injuries might win him sympathy and special consideration soon evaporated. 
</P>
<P>
 At the squat, remote Shawangunk Correctional Facility near this Hudson River 
Valley town, Grassia said, he has been denied catheters, access to showers when 
he loses rectal control and water needed to keep bedsores from becoming 
infected. He also said he was left on the floor for several hours when he fell 
trying to use the toilet. 
</P>
<P>
 When Grassia complained, he told a friend, the correctional officer in charge 
of his cell responded over a loudspeaker: "Hey, Grassia! Did you (defecate) in 
your pants yet? Need a new diaper, cripple?" 
</P>
<P>
 Such accusations are not unique in the state and federal prison systems. But 
renewed sensitivity about disability-rights issues is likely to make them more 
public and legally potent as even jailers attempt to adjust to a new law 
affecting the nation's 43 million disabled people. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers have filed suit on Grassia's behalf, and with passage in 1990 of the 
Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), the rights of prisoners in wheelchairs 
appears to present already overburdened prisons with a new drain on resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is a problem," said Ed Koren, staff attorney with the National 
Prison Project of the American Civil Liberties Union. Not only has jail yard 
violence added to the ranks of disabled prisoners, he said, "but as we put 
prisoners in for longer and longer periods of time, the prison population is 
going to be aging," presumably resulting in more disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 James Flateau, spokesman for the New York State Correctional Services 
Department, suggested that complaints by Grassia, 31, and other disabled 
prisoners at Shawangunk are motivated not by the new law but by a need to make 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have 7,000 to 8,000 lawsuits filed by prisoners each year," he said. "If 
they didn't have the act to sue on, we feel confident they would have found 
another way to do so." 
</P>
<P>
 Flateau said Thomas A. Coughlin III, the state correctional services 
commissioner, has a long record of attention to disability issues. "I think the 
New York prisons have been as responsive to the needs of the disabled and other 
inmates as any system in the country," he said, citing special facilities for 
the severely disabled, prisoners with AIDS, the mentally ill and female 
prisoners who want to care for their infants. 
</P>
<P>
 But at Shawangunk's C-2 unit, where authorities have placed the prison's 14 
inmates who use wheelchairs, disabled inmates insist they are mistreated 
precisely because they cannot move as fast as other prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 Nate Wright, a convicted child molester with cerebral palsy, said in an 
interview in the prison visiting area that he cannot adequately clean himself 
in the 10 to 15 minutes he is given to shower every other day and is 
disciplined when he takes too long. "They can write you up for anything around 
here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Disabled-rights lawyers suing prisons use not only the ADA but also Section 
504 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act, which forbids discrimination on the 
basis of disabilities, and the constitutional prohibition against "cruel and 
unusual punishment." But such cases move slowly, and disabled-rights activists 
have expressed concern about some recent decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, the California Supreme Court ruled that Howard Andrews, 30, serving 
15 years to life for second-degree murder, had a "fundamental right" to refuse 
medical assistance although, as a quadriplegic, he might die without it. 
Andrews fell or jumped from a third-tier cell at Folsom Prison in 1991 and 
intermittently refuses food and medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Stewart, a novelist and disabled-rights activist who has sought help for 
Shawangunk prisoners, said such cases show that authorities would prefer even 
assisted suicide to helping improve prison conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawangunk sinks have push-button faucets difficult to operate from a 
wheelchair. Easton Beckford, a former Shawangunk prisoner, said in an affidavit 
that he has to collect water by using a makeshift stopper and then lifting it 
in his hands to his body, causing some to spill on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Several times he has been given a "deprivation order" for spilling water, 
which means "they turn the cell water on for only 15 minutes each day," he 
said. "That is my only opportunity to drink water, brush my teeth, clean myself 
and flush the toilet."

$9,000 CAR HAS EVERYTHING, FOR $47,000

 A Hong Kong millionaire wanted to complete his car collection with something 
really special, so he ordered a Mini Cooper fitted with a karaoke machine and 
refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he wanted the most luxurious Mini in the world," said Paul Sibley, 
designer at John Cooper Cars, which specializes in "customizing" the small, 
sporty cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Sibley spent $47,000 on George Wong's $9,000 Mini Cooper, inserting a 
television, video recorder and compact disc player in the walnut dashboard. 
</P>
<P>
 A refrigerator large enough to hold a champagne bottle was built into the 
armrest in the back seat and Sibley also managed to find room for a karaoke 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sibley was unable to fulfill one of Wong's wishes. "He wanted to put an 
old Bakelite telephone in the door but we couldn't close it," Sibley said.

HIGH-POWERED BOATS, DEVELOPMENT THREATEN MANATEES; ECOLOGY: THE GREATEST PERIL 
TO THE MERMAIDS OF MYTH, HOWEVER, IS A DWINDLING FOOD SUPPLY, THE COASTAL SEA 
GRASS THAT IS RAPIDLY DISAPPEARING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD COLE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A century from now, lonely sailors may still tell stories of sultry Caribbean 
mermaids, but conservationists fear the gentle manatees that inspired the myth 
will have vanished from the Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 The friendly, floating, 10-foot-long sea cows are one of the world's most 
endangered sea mammals. 
</P>
<P>
 Their sluggish swimming pace makes them vulnerable to the high-powered boats 
that speed across Florida waterways. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest threat to their survival, however, is a dwindling food supply -- 
the coastal sea grass that's rapidly disappearing because of development and 
siltation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dam may burst sometime in the near future," warned Jay Gorzelany of Mote 
Marine Laboratory in Sarasota. "Eventually, you're going to reach a critical 
level where there's just not enough room for manatees and humans to coexist -- 
and you may have a massive manatee die-off." 
</P>
<P>
 The West Indian manatees and their Old World relative, the dugong, are unique. 
They are the only vegetarian sea mammals. Their closest relative is a land 
animal, the elephant. Like many whales and dolphins, they apparently abandoned 
the land for the ocean millions of years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Manatees sometimes nurse their young upright in the water, and, with their 
forward-looking eyes, can be mistaken for a human being at a distance. 
Historians believe early explorers to the New World did just that, creating the 
mermaid myth. 
</P>
<P>
 The precise number of West Indian manatees is unknown. Florida has the 
majority, with more than 1,800 counted in an aerial census last year. Small 
colonies exist on some Caribbean islands and in Central and South America, but 
none are believed to exceed 100 or so. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the manatees can't be saved in Florida with our ample economic resources 
and our fairly educated populace, then I don't think it will be done in 
developing countries," said Kipp Frohlich, protected species administrator for 
Florida's Department of Environmental Protection. 
</P>
<P>
 The state and federal government have taken some basic conservation steps. 
</P>
<P>
 Boat speeds are increasingly regulated in manatee areas. Deaths caused by 
humans, principally boaters, have dropped somewhat over the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Next summer, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is opening a staging area at 
the Kennedy Space Center to gradually release some of 50 captive manatees. The 
"soft release" pens were developed because manatees freed directly into the 
wild have died almost immediately, according to Robert Turner, the agency's 
manatee recovery coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the staging pens work, Turner said the agency must maintain a 
controversial ban on sex between captive manatees. Males and females had to be 
separated because there is no more room or money to keep captive calves. The 
animals cost up to $40,000 a year just to feed. 
</P>
<P>
 But breeding manatees is not the problem, scientists agree. New data from 
Bruce Ackerman of the state's Florida Marine Research Institute shows female 
manatees may have calves earlier and more frequently than once thought. 
</P>
<P>
 Ackerman is cautious about his unfinished research. But, he said, the 
short-term manatee count seems to be increasing in some areas because of 
increased manatee births and decreased deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists remain skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've averaged about 160 manatees dying a year for the last four years," said 
Nancy Sadusky of the Maitland-based Save the Manatee Club, headed by singer 
Jimmy Buffett. "The population is going nowhere. If we continue at this rate, 
they are definitely headed for extinction." 
</P>
<P>
 Even experts who think the numbers are rising in the short run worry about the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 They note that almost all adult manatees have been hit at least once by a 
boat; Ackerman, for example, counted 22 different propeller hits on one animal. 
Propeller hits are so universal, biologists use them to identify the animals, 
keeping a book of scar patterns as a central record. 
</P>
<P>
 Ackerman worries that the dip in boat deaths over the last two years will be 
reversed because of Florida's increasing population; 1,000 people a day move 
into the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Loss of habitat is the darkest cloud, all agree. 
</P>
<P>
 Adult manatees eat 100 to 200 pounds of green plants a day. They even relish 
the nuisance plants that clog some Florida waterways. But the staple of their 
diet is sea grass, which is disappearing rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tampa Bay has already lost 65% or 75% of its sea grasses," said Turner. "Even 
inland development contributes -- the runoff that comes down the river reduces 
the light in the water, which reduces the sea grass." 
</P>
<P>
 The sea grasses will recover if water quality improves, but the long-range 
trends are not good, he said.

THOUSANDS FLEE AFGHAN CAPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tens of thousands of people, some carrying children and hauling belongings in 
rickety carts, fled the capital Saturday as warring Islamic factions observed a 
daylong cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is like hell here," said Rahila, who like most Afghans uses only one name. 
"I can't live here anymore. The leaders are responsible for the tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Departing U.N. officials said the number of fleeing residents slogging through 
slush and snow might total in the hundreds of thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the newest refugees on the road from Kabul to Jalalabad, 70 miles to 
the east, were wearing sandals and little warm clothing, said a U.N. spokesman 
in Islamabad, Pakistan.

ECOLOGY FIGHT IN NEW ENGLAND FORESTS; CONSERVATION: PERILED WOODLANDS STRETCH 
FROM ADIRONDACKS TO MOST OF MAINE.

<P>
 Not since the timber barons ripped through the White Mountains at the turn of 
the century has there been such debate about the future of the region's 
forests. 
</P>
<P>
 Fueled by greed, the timber companies stripped whole mountains to feed the 
industrial revolution, creating a wasteland and destroying a way of life for 
local loggers who had harvested the forest for generations. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress came to the rescue, creating the White Mountain National Forest and 
an Eastern park system that has grown to 25 million acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, Congress is being asked to intervene in the region -- this time on 
behalf of the 26-million-acre northern forest. Next June, the congressionally 
created Northern Forest Lands Council will recommend future uses for the 
forest. 
</P>
<P>
 The swath of woodlands stretches from New York's Adirondack Mountains across 
the top quarter of Vermont and through the dense timber forests of New 
Hampshire. It includes two-thirds of Maine. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventy million people live within an 8-hour drive of the forest, which 
contains 250 species of wildlife, rivers and lakes, and provides the economic 
base for hundreds of communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists say the council's recommendations could lead to the largest 
regulatory change in the region since Congress created the White Mountain 
National Forest in 1917. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at something that will do that for the 21st Century," said 
Stephen Blackmer, director of conservation programs for the Appalachian 
Mountain Club. 
</P>
<P>
 But the solutions of the past -- massive government purchases -- no longer are 
appropriate. The council is considering a plan to meet both economic and 
environmental interests. 
</P>
<P>
 That coexistence is essential, because 86% of the northern forest is privately 
owned and is the lifeblood of logging and paper communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can't agree, we're all doomed," said Kelly Short, communications 
director for Appalachian club. 
</P>
<P>
 Business and environmental groups are trying to influence the council, made up 
of four representatives from each state and a federal wildlife official. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, the council released an overview of the assets and importance of 
the forest to the region's economy. The report also outlined the risks posed by 
timbering, tax policies and other economic forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The council listed possible means of protecting the forest, including 
instituting recreational taxes to pay the bill. Council members now are 
analyzing comments they received. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've almost got to pull a rabbit out of a hat," said Blackmer, who shares 
a fear among environmentalists that the council's recommendations will be too 
weak. 
</P>
<P>
 Others fear that the council will go too far. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shouldn't the right of earning a living and providing for one's family come 
before that of recreation?" officials from three northern New Hampshire 
communities asked in a letter to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental groups hope to minimize that divisiveness and avoid mistakes 
made in the Pacific Northwest -- which remains sharply divided over limiting 
logging to preserve the endangered spotted owl. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that spirit of compromise, the region likely will become the nation's 
next battleground over environmental and economic concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Appalachian club and a coalition of more than a dozen organizations 
including the Sierra Club, National Audubon Society, National Wildlife 
Federation and Conservation Law Foundation want the public debate to focus on 
three objectives. 
</P>
<P>
 First, they want environmentally sensitive forest management to replace 
timbering practices such as clear-cutting, herbicide use and other problems 
brought about by mechanization of the timber industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Blackmer uses an ocean analogy to describe the effect of unsound logging 
practices on the timber industry. Fishermen once hauled huge cod out of the 
Atlantic, but "now get junk fish and turn them into fake crab." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the glorious white pines once harvested in the forest are gone, 
leaving large amounts of junk wood that must be pressed into particle board, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Encouraging sound forestry through selective cutting -- "basically like 
weeding a garden" -- will ensure that the northern forest remains productive, 
Blackmer said. He said the government can encourage this through tax 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 The second focus of the council's report should be on the dangers of unchecked 
development, according to the coalition. The sale of nearly one million acres 
in the northern forest in 1988 -- much of it to developers -- provided a 
"wake-up call" for safeguards, Blackmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The government could do things such as buy development rights from timber 
companies, making it impossible for them to sell the land to speculators and 
encouraging them to maintain it. This was done in areas like the Lake Umbagog 
reserve, where timber companies can cut interior sections but must be 
aesthetically friendly near shorelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, the coalition recommends permanently protecting core wilderness areas, 
maybe through trade-offs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the public is going to lose this, then they should have a protected area 
elsewhere," said Kenneth Kimball, the Appalachian club's research director, as 
he stood by a section of the Androscoggin River in Berlin, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
 Sections of the river once known for their white-water canoeing have been 
reduced to a trickle because of hydroelectric dams used to power the James 
River paper mill in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
 But with every trade-off or change there will be a public cost, whether in the 
form of economic incentives, tax changes or loans to diversify the region's 
economy and lead it away from its heavy reliance on timbering. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a free lunch," Blackmer said.

 Paul Glancy is interested in buying your Nordic Track. But you can keep the 
rowing machine. 
</P>
<P>
 At his store in the Washington suburb of Herndon, Va., Glancy watches people 
lug in their used sporting goods and exercise equipment, and carry out cash for 
the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Glancy is a franchisee of Play It Again Sports. The chain makes money from 
America's notorious exercise fickleness -- the habit of buying workout gear 
with the best of intentions but leaving it to gather dust because using it 
requires effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Play It Again Sports gives these people a place to cash in their lost dreams. 
Although the stores carry new equipment, their specialty is buying, reselling 
and consigning used goods. They accept anything from ice skates to home gyms. 
</P>
<P>
 The equipment is sold to people willing to accept serviceable used equipment 
and attracted by prices below the cost of buying new. 
</P>
<P>
 "In general, good-condition used is sold at about half the original retail 
price," Glancy said. Prices for used equipment depend on the quality of the 
equipment and whether it's seasonal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a perfect time for people to do the housecleaning -- and determine 
what gifts they would like to buy with those dollars,' said Bob Lennie, the 
chain's vice president for corporate development. 
</P>
<P>
 The equipment he's most likely to buy is in the mid- to upper-price range, 
Lennie said at the 375-store chain's headquarters in the Minneapolis suburb of 
Golden Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Nordic Track cross-country-style aerobic exercise equipment holds its value 
well, but don't bother to bring in poorly made imitations, Glancy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the public recognizes what's quality and what's junk and what won't 
work, and they won't reinvest in it," Glancy said. "People know lemons." 
</P>
<P>
 Home gyms also sell well, provided they're well made. A well-made home gym has 
heavy-gauge steel and is put together so strongly that it's stable while a 
person exercises, Glancy said. It also has a simple design that does not 
require a person to move a lot of parts as he sets up for his next exercise, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion also counts. Stair-climbing machines are popular, so franchisees want 
to buy them, Lennie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Treadmills are somewhat less popular, but Glancy buys and sells them. Rowing 
machines are way down on the desirability list. 
</P>
<P>
 Half the owners of rowing machines report they didn't use them in the previous 
month, said Harvey Lauer, president of American Sports Data, a sports 
demographics company in Hartsdale, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three out of 10 owners of exercise equipment had not used it at all in the 
last month," Lauer said. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean those people have abandoned workouts, though. Some choose to 
join a health club, and may feel they no longer need what they have at home, 
Lennie said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the company is not in the business of helping people clean out their 
basements. It expects people who enter with something to sell will return for 
something to buy. And it expects them soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a surge in January, due to the New Year's resolution to lose 10 
pounds," Lennie said.

KITTY'S LIFE IS THE CAT'S MEOW AFTER HE INHERITS $500,000; FRIENDSHIP: ANN 
MORGAN BELIEVED SHE HAD A LIFETIME COMMITMENT TO CARE FOR TINKER, WHO RESTORED

 When Ann Morgan died and left her $500,000 estate to a male, much younger 
companion, there were no complaints -- the beneficiary was her cat, Tinker. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan's will stipulates that her apartment be maintained and a caretaker be 
hired for Tinker, a fluffy white Turkish Angora type she described as "my best 
friend and companion." 
</P>
<P>
 "She felt that once you took an animal, it was a lifelong commitment," said 
Ruth Ward, a friend of Morgan's. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan, 74, died in May -- a month after putting Tinker in her will. After 
Tinker's death, the balance of Morgan's $500,000 estate will go to charity. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan never married and lived alone. She got Tinker about 10 years ago after 
a long succession of dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This cat was Ann's life," Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time she got Tinker, Ann was not feeling well and was depressed. The 
kitten gave her a reason to keep living. You could see the smile return to her 
face after she brought it home," Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan's estate will pay for the $385 monthly rent on the apartment, a 
caretaker's salary, Tinker's veterinarian bills, his eventual burial at a pet 
cemetery and flowers for his grave at Christmas and Easter.

FATHER PANIK VILLAGE NOW A CRIMINALS' PARADISE; BRIDGEPORT, CONN.: COMPLEX IS 
BEING VACATED AND DEMOLISHED AS OFFICIALS GIVE UP IN FACE OF DRUGS, DECAY AND 
DEATH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 There was a time -- before the drugs arrived, before the decay and crime set 
in -- when children frolicked on the swing sets of Father Panik Village. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first public housing project in New England, and the people had 
pride in their homes, in the vegetables they planted in small plots just 
outside their doors, in their friends and neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 No more. 
</P>
<P>
 Father Panik Village, the most notorious housing project in a notorious city, 
is being vacated and demolished. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities decided that the project, once hailed as a prototype for the kind 
of safe, modern housing the government could provide for the poor, was so far 
gone that there was no other remedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Many longtime residents agree, but it saddens them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be beautiful here. You could go downtown and leave your house 
unlocked and you wouldn't have to worry about anything," said True Hamilton, 
72, who has lived in the project for 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, we're scared to even come out of the door at night. And when we hear 
gunshots, we hit the floor," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been here so long. I treat the people here like family and they treat me 
like family. I won't know how to live out there," said Kathleen Vila, who moved 
into the project with her family in 1943, when she was 9 months old. 
</P>
<P>
 When the project opened in 1941, it was a clean, modern complex touted as a 
solution to slum housing. Built to replace shanties for factory workers, it 
housed nearly 5,000 people in 46 three-story buildings spread over 40 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 "Early on, you had the family structure in place, you had a working 
population. Then, as time progressed, you began to face the social ills that 
we're facing today in society," said Clarence H. Craig Jr., executive director 
of the authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, in addition to that, there was serious mismanagement in the late '70s," 
Craig said. "Services that were necessary weren't being provided. There wasn't 
proper police patrol, garbage pickup and other normal services that any other 
neighborhood gets. Things just went downhill from there." 
</P>
<P>
 Outsiders turned the project's courtyards into open-air drug markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are out there doing it openly in broad daylight -- day or night, in 
blizzards or rain," said Vila, president of the project's tenants association. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way the courtyards are laid out, it's easy to just run in and run out, so 
this is a hard place to control," she said. "And there was never a dominant 
police presence here, so the people selling drugs just started to run things." 
</P>
<P>
 By 1986, the crime rate at Father Panik had soared out of control and the 
project was virtually uninhabitable. That year, the city, after deciding the 
1,063-unit project could not be saved, began knocking down the buildings. In 
September, workers began demolishing the last 15 buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal housing officials have agreed to provide rental subsidies for the 300 
families who still live in the project. They will be moved to housing in other 
parts of the city over the next six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig said the housing authority is planning to redevelop the site with new 
duplexes that will include both rental and privately owned units. 
</P>
<P>
 Bridgeport is not the first city to give up on a housing project. Officials in 
Philadelphia, Chicago, Newark, N.J., Providence, R.I., and other cities have 
turned to the wrecking ball when projects became overrun with crime or decayed 
so much they were unsafe to live in. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last decade, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development has 
approved the demolition of approximately 20,000 public housing units. That's 
out of a total of about 1.3 million nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not a routine solution," said Alexander Garvin, a former deputy housing 
commissioner for New York City, now a lecturer in urban planning and 
development at Yale University. "It is a controversial solution because it is 
destroying the number of apartments available to people with low income." 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents say city officials are more worried about Bridgeport's image 
than about living conditions at the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to get rid of this place. They think it's the cause of all 
Bridgeport's problems," said James Earl, 23, who grew up at Father Panik. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials acknowledge they are happy to see the end of an embarrassing 
symbol of Bridgeport's decay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, it picked up a reputation that got a degree of notoriety, which in 
turn seemed to have fed some of the further problems there," said Police Chief 
Thomas Sweeney. "It got to the point where it was almost like free advertising 
for drug dealing." 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeney said the housing project averaged five homicides a year out of a total 
about 50 to 60 murders per year in all of Bridgeport. 
</P>
<P>
 "For one area, that's probably the single densest and most consistent 
concentration," Sweeney said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last year, drug dealers have shot at three police officers 
patrolling the area. In one incident, a young woman was killed when drug 
dealers fired 76 rounds from a semiautomatic weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 The once-green courtyards are paved with concrete. Graffiti covers the 
buildings; the swing sets and basketball hoops are rusted and rotting. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it was in better condition, I'd like to stay," said Hamilton. "But the way 
it is now, you never know when they're going to start shooting."

<P>
 Only a trunk emergency line has been working for the past several days after 
the recently privatized telephone company cut off all other services to police 
and fire brigades in Chaco province, 700 miles north of Buenos Aires, a police

 Chaco province is next to Santiago del Estero, where civil servants demanding 
payment of overdue wages went on a looting and arson spree last month --

CAR FAMILY FEUDS OVER WHO WAS IN DRIVER'S SEAT; HISTORY: THE DURYEA BROTHERS 
ARE CREDITED WITH INVENTING THE AMERICAN AUTOMOBILE 100 YEARS AGO. BUT FAMILY 
MEMBERS AND HISTORIANS ARE TRYING TO SEPARATE FACT FROM FRICTION. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A century after brothers Charles and Frank Duryea collaborated on the 
automobile bearing their name, descendants are feuding over the family legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute: Which Duryea was father of the American automobile? 
</P>
<P>
 Neither, say some experts, who describe the Duryeas as geniuses who did not 
invent the auto but perfected it. But the Duryeas have their partisans. 
</P>
<P>
 "They justly deserve titles of father of the American automobile industry," 
insists Richard Scharchburg, a professor at the GMI Engineering and Management 
Institute in Flint, Mich., and biographer of Frank Duryea. 
</P>
<P>
 But which one? The search for the answer goes back a century, to the months 
before Sept. 21, 1893, when Frank Duryea drove 600 feet in the streets of 
Springfield, Mass., in a prototype one-cylinder car. 
</P>
<P>
 The Duryeas were farm boys from the Peoria area who joined in the rapidly 
growing bicycle industry of the late 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1886, at the Ohio State Fair, Charles Duryea saw a gas engine that could, 
he thought, power a carriage or wagon. His imagination sparked, he decided to 
try to build a horseless carriage. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was the 1893 car, "the first that was actually built and operated 
in the United States," according to the Encyclopedia Brittanica. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, a second model won $2,000 by placing first in the 
Chicago-Evanston, Ill., Thanksgiving Day race -- the first gasoline automobile 
race in the United States. And in 1896, the Duryea Motor Wagon Co. sold 13 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
 But the company failed, and the brothers split up. The argument over who was 
the rightful inventor of that first car drove a wedge between the Duryeas. 
</P>
<P>
 Historians describe Charles as a visionary with more than 50 patents, and a 
shameless self-promoter whose ideas were brought to life by his younger 
brother, Frank, a master mechanical engineer with 20 patents of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Charles took sole credit in patent applications for the 1893 engine, 
it's clear Frank deserves great credit, Scharchburg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles always said Frank was "simply a mechanic" hired to execute his design. 
But Charles left Massachusetts and returned to his bicycle business in Peoria 
before the project was completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Charles left, the car was not running," Scharchburg said. "It would not 
run with the engine he described and the transmission would not work. 
</P>
<P>
 "A year after Charles left, Frank finished the car and made it run. Frank 
developed an entirely new engine, new transmission, a carburetor and ignition. 
Every fundamental part of the car, Frank developed while Charles was in 
Peoria." 
</P>
<P>
 In the years that followed their split, Charles designed several vehicles, 
some of them with three wheels. Frank joined the Stevens Arms Co. and designed 
the Stevens-Duryea, a limousine that was built into the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles died in 1938 in Philadelphia; Frank died in 1967 in Saybrook, Conn. 
The controversy over who did what lived on in their family. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is sad, and my grandfather felt that way," said George R. Duryea, 67, 
Frank's grandson. "Certainly it was a source of regret for him. He didn't want 
any part of the arguments with Charles. But he sulked about for years about all 
these lies going around by Charles' family." 
</P>
<P>
 Even today, his family is working to amend a plaque on the Statehouse steps in 
Boston that honors Charles but doesn't mention Frank. 
</P>
<P>
 But Charles' great-grandson, Jonathan Duryea Fuller, insists that "credit for 
the invention goes to Charles, with assistance through building to Frank." 
</P>
<P>
 He and his sister, Susan Fuller Hanson, argue that Charles had the engine 
running in 1892 and that Frank was unjustly glorified a year later when he 
test-drove the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel like they are trying to discredit Charles and give all the credit to 
Frank. We don't want Charles to lose the credit he deserves," Hanson said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Charles' granddaughters, Joanne Duryea Armstrong of Lincoln, Mass., 
just wants the controversy to go away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was a joint effort, and it should say the Duryea brothers built 
it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The car the brothers created was truly a horseless carriage: a crude vehicle 
with oak-spoke wheels turned by bicycle chains and guided by a tiller. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just another experiment," said Roger White, transportation history 
specialist at the Smithsonian's National Museum of American History in 
Washington, where that first Duryea auto is housed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were dozens of people trying to make internal-combustion cars in the 
1890s," White said. "The Duryeas were not the first. We may never know who the 
very first was."

KEY IRISH MODERATE ASKS FOR CLARIFICATION OF PEACE PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A key moderate Catholic leader in Northern Ireland urged British Prime 
Minister John Major on Saturday to spell out parts of a British-Irish peace 
proposal, a move requested by the Irish Republican Army. 
</P>
<P>
 John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labor Party, said a 
review of the proposal would not constitute negotiations, which Major has 
refused. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prize at the end of the road is so great," Hume said, "that I think 
everybody should do everything in their power, and particularly governments, to 
ensure that comes about." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerry Adams, president of Sinn Fein, the IRA's political arm, has written to 
Major asking for clarification of the accord before an official IRA response is 
given. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams particularly sought clarification of two points: a reference to 
self-determination for the people of Ireland and whether the Protestant 
majority in Ulster would have a veto over island-wide moves for unification.

ABU DHABI ROYALS DROP CLAIM FOR $400 MILLION IN BCCI CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. officials settled a legal battle with Abu Dhabi on Saturday when the 
Persian Gulf state's royal family agreed to give up claims to $400 million 
invested in First American Bankshares Inc., a U.S. bank illegally owned by the 
scandal-ridden Bank of Credit & Commerce International. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said the agreement gives investigators access to a key figure in the 
scandal: Swaleh Naqvi, the chief deputy to BCCI founder Agha Hasan Abedi. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, a $1.5-billion lawsuit brought by First American's court-appointed 
trustee against Abu Dhabi's ruler, who was the majority shareholder in the 
now-defunct BCCI, will be dropped.

IT'S A WIPEOUT AS RIGHT CAR KEY UNLOCKS WRONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The cars looked exactly alike, even down to the ignition keys. Call it a case 
of mistaken auto identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Ian Quinn, a 20-year-old University of Massachusetts student, reported his 
1986 blue Chevrolet Nova stolen early Friday when it wasn't where he parked it. 
</P>
<P>
 An officer noticed a 1986 blue Nova parked on the same street about 50 yards 
away. A registration check identified the owner, Tanya Hannon of Amherst. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, Hannon had mistaken Quinn's car for her own, said Detective Ron 
Young. She entered the unlocked door, started the ignition with her own key, 
and headed homeward. 
</P>
<P>
 "As is customary with a lot of Chevys, one key fits all," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Melissa Garman, a spokeswoman for Chevrolet, said she had no immediate details 
on Nova ignition systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Hannon returned the car to Quinn downtown a short while later, accompanied by 
her boyfriend so she'd have a ride back home. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Quinn's Nova nightmare wasn't over. As he drove away, a car 
making a U-turn hit him. 
</P>
<P>
 Who was in the other car? 
</P>
<P>
 Hannon and her boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 The boyfriend was cited for making an improper turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn's car was totaled. Not to mention his night.

SNOW, ARCTIC AIR LASH A DOZEN STATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Snow, freezing rain and arctic air lashed much of the nation Friday, shutting 
offices and schools in a dozen states. 
</P>
<P>
 Several deaths were attributed to the weather, including two people near 
Chicago: A 77-year-old woman was killed when a snowplow backed into her and an 
elderly man collapsed and died as he shoveled snow. Another death was blamed on 
icy roads in northern Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
 A mixture of snow, sleet and freezing rain fell from northern Virginia into 
southern New England, with some accumulations totaling 7 inches. And snow 
continued across the Great Lakes region, with 36 inches reported at Finland, 
Minn., since noon Thursday, and 23 inches at Duluth, Minn. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the hardest hit areas was Philadelphia, with freezing rain and icy roads 
prompting the city to send all nonessential employees home. 
</P>
<P>
 Interstate 95, the main highway through the area, was shut down and a snow 
emergency was declared by the state of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
 All commuter bus service was shut down in the Philadelphia area, although 
trains and subways kept operating. New Jersey bus operations were also 
curtailed. 
</P>
<P>
 Highways around New York City were coated in an icy crust, causing hundreds of 
minor accidents as road crews struggled to lay down enough sand and salt to 
keep up with the sleet and freezing rain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a complete mess. The roads are terrible," said a Connecticut State 
Police officer in Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
 The West Virginia Turnpike was shut down for several hours after a 
tractor-trailer accident, and numerous accidents were reported on Interstate 
81, although they occurred at slow speeds and no one was hurt, said sheriff's 
Deputy John Vanorsdale. 
</P>
<P>
 "I-81 is nothing but a sheet of ice," he said. "People are on the median. 
People are over the banks. People are off the shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
 Airports from Pennsylvania to Maine reported delays due to snow or ice on the 
Tarmac, and ice closed two of four runways at New York's John F. Kennedy 
International Airport early Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Delta and USAir shuttles connecting New York with Washington and Boston were 
disrupted, running every two hours instead of the usual hourly schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything's so backed up we're just getting one flight on the runway at a 
time," said one Delta operations manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters said that snow was not the main problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst thing isn't so much the snow. It's the ice that's causing most of 
the problems," said Accu-Weather Inc. forecaster Jim Candor in State College, 
Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 A sudden plunge in temperatures Friday morning snapped some electrical lines 
in western Wisconsin, leaving about 600 customers without power for four hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow that wrought havoc in eastern Kentucky earlier in the week melted into a 
flash-flood hazard Friday, rolling across roads and prompting some evacuations. 
</P>
<P>
 In South Dakota, where there was heavy drifting, many schools canceled 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston was buried in nearly a foot of snow and could get a foot more before 
the storm passes late Friday, Candor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Overturned trucks and skidding cars littered highways throughout New England, 
and most schools were closed in the six-state region. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters attributed the storm to a stubborn weather pattern formed by 
moisture gathering in the lower Mississippi Valley and meeting gradually colder 
air as it moved northeast. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm was expected to bring at least another day of snow, sleet and 
freezing rain throughout the Appalachians and the Northeast. 
</P>
<P>
 Ski resort operators from New Jersey to Maine were having their best season in 
years, thanks to a rapid-fire succession of snowstorms since just after 
Christmas. "It's some of the best skiing we've had this early in the season in 
10 years," said Molly Maher of the Ski Vermont trade group.

'$5-FRANK' STILL FLYING HIGH AT 72 WITH HIS WHITE-KNUCKLE RIDES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY NUSSBAUM, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The little airplane roared up the homemade runway, confident, bouncing uphill 
and keeping a little to the right to stay on the narrow pavement. Then, 
quickly, up, up, up over the New River Gorge. 
</P>
<P>
 Way down to the right is the majestic, steel-arch New River Gorge Bridge. For 
a better look, the pilot banks the plane hard, hard right. Whoa, there it is, 
straight down. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot is as picturesque as the view. 
</P>
<P>
 He is Frank Thomas, known in these parts as Five-Dollar Frank. That's the 
price of his 15-minute knuckle-numbing ride. He gives you his mountain 
philosophy about God, government and everything in between for free. 
</P>
<P>
 Hang on. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no better ride at this price anywhere in the world," Thomas says. "I 
want to share this beautiful, magnificent wonderland with as many people as I 
can. I hate to go home in the evening and I go back out as soon as I can." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas is 72. He's been flying, with youthful enthusiasm, for nearly 53 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 16 years old when it comes to flying and beauty," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He is up at dawn, thrilling sightseers until the sun sinks below the 
mountains. He has left himself no time for a family. His marriage is to the 
blue sky and the green West Virginia landscape beneath it. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas' father died when he was 3. When he was old enough to get a job as a 
theater usher he used some of his earnings for flying lessons, but didn't tell 
his mother, who disapproved. Soon he was flying sick people to hospitals and 
doing other charter work throughout the Appalachians. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was 23, back in 1944, he cleared a gentle hillside about 37 miles 
southeast of Charleston -- cleared it himself with ax and saw. The result is 
Fayette Airport, home of his Poor Men's Flying School where he has taught more 
than 1,000 students to fly. 
</P>
<P>
 One was Roy Swanigan, a poor man sure enough. Swanigan, a year older than 
Thomas, lost both legs in a coal mine accident in 1946 and had a wife and two 
children to support. Frank gave him a job at the airport and also taught him to 
fly. In 1954, Swanigan became, he says, America's first double amputee with a 
pilot's license. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frank is a very peculiar person in a lot of ways," Swanigan says, "but he has 
a heart of gold." 
</P>
<P>
 If you're thinking of flying to the Fayette Airport, by the way, a state guide 
for pilots advises that if you want runway lights you should phone ahead "or 
circle the field." 
</P>
<P>
 A rusted metal stand props open the door to the airport office. A note stuck 
on the stand says: "Back in 15 minutes. Will fly." A German shepherd dog, 
Runway, sleeps under a table. The room is crammed with trinkets, papers, books. 
One is Thomas' own collection of anecdotes and poems: "It Is This Way With Men 
Who Fly." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank's sense of humor does, as Swanigan says, run to the peculiar. For 
instance, he keeps a dummy electric chair (a colander serves for a cap) in one 
airport hangar. A storage shed stands nearby with large footprints trailing up 
the side. Outside his office stands a homemade guillotine with red paint 
splashed on it. Frank credits Disney World for inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, you can go to Disney or you can go to MGM, but who thinks of just 
offering a tour of this area?" says Roger Mayo, 27, a geography student at 
Michigan State University. Mayo works summers as a guide for white-water 
rafting tours on nearby rivers. He says he sends tourists who are looking for 
other Appalachian attractions to take a ride with Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's an attraction in himself," Mayo says. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Five-Dollar Frank charges only half that price for children. He is 
convincing when he says his interest is in nature's riches, not man's. "What 
would I do with money?," he asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got such a joy for flying," says Becky Chisum. "He likes to share it 
with people. I really believe that." 
</P>
<P>
 Chisum, 32, helps run an aircraft maintenance and inspection business at the 
airport and helps take care of Thomas' fleet of planes. 
</P>
<P>
 The fleet numbers three. A second pilot helps out on weekends. A line of 
customers usually snakes along the chain-link fence that surrounds the lone 
runway, which, with its bumps and cracks, looks much like a 2,145-foot driveway 
that needs some work. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar carefree wear shows on Thomas. He requires two hearing aids to hear 
riders' squeals and cries above the airplane's engine. The airplane, a Cessna 
172, likewise shows hard use. Its seat cushions are held together with duct 
tape. 
</P>
<P>
 But the view never gets old.

OIL SPILL OFF PUERTO RICO BLACKENS BEACH, PERILS TOURISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 750,000 gallons of heating oil spilled into the sea after a barge ran 
into a reef just offshore here Friday, blackening about a mile of this city's 
golden beaches and threatening to disrupt the island's tourist industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't believe it.I walked down here just ready to lay in the sun. This 
is terrible," said Betty Sue Cooper of Dallas, looking woefully onto the Caribe 
Hilton beach, where the sand was coated with slimy black oil. The water 
glimmered black. 
</P>
<P>
 The Morris J. Burman barge, carrying more than 1.5 million gallons of oil, was 
being pulled past San Juan to Antigua by a tugboat before dawn Friday when a 
line snapped and the barge crashed into the reef. Some of its nine tanks 
ruptured, sending heavy black oil gushing into the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pedro Rossello called the spill "a catastrophe" and said he hopes a quick 
cleanup could soften the blow to the island's tourism industry. The spill 
apparently did not affect Atlantic and Caribbean resorts outside San Juan. 
</P>
<P>
 At an evening news conference, Transportation Secretary Federico Pena said 
that the barge had spilled about 750,000 gallons into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency workers laid floating barriers to limit the damage to a mile-long 
strip of the Atlantic coast, while helicopters roared overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 High waves pounded the barge, wedged in shallow water in a reef 300 yards 
offshore, raising fears it could break up. Oil spill specialists and heavy 
equipment were en route. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Coast Guard Cmdr. Robert Ross, coordinator for oil spill response in San 
Juan, said a barge with a pump was being brought in to remove the oil.

EXERCISE A FIT RESOLUTION FOR NEW YEAR; WALKING: NEW GUIDELINES SUGGEST THAT 
THE GREATEST BENEFIT IS GAINED BY THOSE WHO HAVE DONE NOTHING AND START DOING 
SOMETHING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRA DREYFUSS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This year's New Year's resolution to exercise may be the easiest to keep. 
</P>
<P>
 You no longer need to jog, dance or lift weights. You needn't do anything more 
taxing than walk for a half hour a day -- and you can break the half hour into 
chunks as small as you want. 
</P>
<P>
 The new guidelines from the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 
and the American College of Sports Medicine were issued last summer. 
Researchers have found that the greatest exercise benefit goes to those who 
have done nothing and start doing something. Exercise cuts their risk of death 
from many causes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can reduce their risk for disease (as) much as smoking cessation," said 
researcher Steven N. Blair, an epidemiologist at the Cooper Institute for 
Aerobics Research in Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 If you haven't tried the guidelines yet, their supporters can't think of a 
better time than now. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know New Year's resolutions are important," said Russell R. Pate, ACSM's 
president. The trick is to make the resolutions last. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we've done is pretty much eliminated the excuses -- that they don't have 
the time, money, equipment or a place to exercise -- that most people give for 
not exercising," said Dr. Kenneth Cooper, the aerobics godfather who founded 
the institute where Blair works. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines are aimed at making exercise a part of life. Gardening counts. 
So does taking the stairs instead of the escalator, or parking your car at the 
far edge of the mall instead of as close as you can get. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is to pick "a small number of specific changes (people) will be 
prepared to make on a very consistent basis," Pate said. Vague goals, such as 
resolving to do some unstated form of exercise, eventually are ignored, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 This doesn't mean everyone will resolve to exercise, and 1994 will see streets 
full of walkers. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60% of Americans don't exercise, and some of them just don't want to, 
because they don't think it's fun -- they might rather watch television, said 
researcher Rod K. Dishman of the University of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans are creative at avoiding work," Dishman said. "We are ingenious in 
our ways to conserve human energy. Some people call that laziness." 
</P>
<P>
 Laziness misses an opportunity, Cooper believes. He'd have people see the 
issue this way: "If I'm not motivated, can I afford not to be, since the 
benefits are so substantial with so little investment?" 
</P>
<P>
 Others fail from an inability to plan, Dishman said, "It's a misperception 
(that) it's always a motivational problem," he said. "It takes a hell of a lot 
of motivation to overcome bad planning." 
</P>
<P>
 If you're willing to start 1994 with a new burst of exercise, Dishman advises 
you to think of activities you've tried or would like to, and see exactly when 
and where in your day they might be done, he said. The exercise that fits your 
desires and schedule best is the one to start with, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pate, Cooper and Dishman agree that the goals amount to a solid minimum, and 
are not meant to discourage people from doing more. Cooper emphasizes that 
there is a difference between being healthy (having a low risk of disease) and 
being fit -- which takes more work but which gives you greater endurance, 
vitality and quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
 But aerobic fitness means jogging and similar activities, done at least three 
times a week for at least 20 minutes at a time.

 Thrift store millionaire Ray Ellison leaned back in his office chair and 
laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows a liar when he sees one, he said. And he knows a liberal. He doesn't 
like either. 
</P>
<P>
 "I called him a slimeball, scum-sucking liar," said Ellison, 65, reciting a 
description of then-Ventura Mayor Dennis Orrock that he painted on a truck 
parked near a freeway in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison took on the mayor's ally the following year, dubbing Councilwoman Pati 
Longo "The Phony with The Toni" in full-page newspaper ads that declared her a 
liar, too. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Ellison's large ads depicted Councilman Donald Villeneuve astride a 
defecating bull, stating: "Screw the Marketplace." Last fall, two councilmen 
and a challenger were featured as smiling fish in ads titled: "A Fish Stinks 
From The Head. Take A Sniff of These." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the forces that have reshaped Ventura's political landscape in recent years 
-- pushing campaigns to increasingly personal attacks -- none has been 
consistently harsher than Raymond W. Ellison. 
</P>
<P>
 Spending tens of thousands of dollars, including at least $14,000 last fall, 
Ellison has been described by critics as Ventura's godfather of mudslinging. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on the ads he ran, I would judge him to be venal and mean, coarse and 
crass," said former Councilman Todd Collart, defeated Nov. 5 after he was 
caricatured as a smelly fish. "He continues to set lower and lower standards to 
be aimed for by others. And that works against good people seeking elective 
office." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Gary Tuttle -- also featured in the "fish ads" -- said he 
considered not running for a second term last year because of Ellison. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew he was going to come after me, and I had to think, 'Do I want to put 
my family through this?' " he said. "My mom, my wife, my sisters, they got very 
upset. The Tuttle name has always been a positive in this community." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some candidates backed by Ellison distanced themselves from his methods. 
Newly elected Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures called a press conference before 
the election to say she was not associated with Ellison, and asked that he 
cancel future ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman James Monahan, a recipient of Ellison political assistance for 16 
years, said recently that he does not condone his friend's advertisements, 
because they "can have a negative effect on everyone. You can turn people off." 
</P>
<P>
 But to many of Ellison's political allies and friends, the Ventura businessman 
is far more complicated and admirable than his crude public persona might 
suggest. And his opinions -- though presented in a blunt style -- air the 
frustrations of Ventura's business community, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters say Ellison holds work, family and religion most dear -- that he is 
generous in his donations to church and charity and in his employment of 
society's least employable. 
</P>
<P>
 A high school dropout turned business whiz, Ellison says he started the 
nation's first privately owned thrift store in 1948 with money he earned as a 
paratrooper in World War II. Now semi-retired, he claims about 1,300 employees 
in the 28 stores he and his two sons own or operate in seven states. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at organizations for war veterans say Ellison's thrift stores keep 
them in business by paying the charities millions of dollars a year for donated 
goods or by operating charity-owned stores at a healthy profit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States could use more Ray Ellisons," said Jim Pechin, business 
manager for the Vietnam Veterans of America in Washington. "We probably 
wouldn't be here today without Ray, because he developed our funding base." 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, Ellison donates to charity golf tournaments and gives time and money 
to the First Baptist Church of Ventura. In recent days, he helped decorate the 
church for Christmas dinners -- then washed dishes afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just a very helpful, generous man," said Nick Bailey, a church associate 
pastor. "He's not afraid when he sees needs in the church community and in the 
ministry here to be a part of the solution." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura attorney William D. Fairfield, who has known Ellison for 20 years, 
said of his friend: 
</P>
<P>
 "I have tremendous respect for this man -- for his integrity, for his business 
acumen, for him as a family man. And I think he's done more for this community 
than any single individual by asking public officials to be accountable." 
</P>
<P>
 Banker Bob Alviani, president-elect of the Ventura Chamber of Commerce, said 
the comments of Ellison -- whose philosophy is pro-growth, pro-business and 
anti-government waste -- reflect the sentiments of others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Ray Ellison is alone in his feelings or alone in how he 
expresses his opinion," Alviani said. "If he wants to pay the price to say what 
he's saying, fine. If you take it to heart, fine. If you choose to ignore it, 
fine too. 
</P>
<P>
 "The wonderful thing about our politics in this country is that a person has a 
right to say whatever they want," Alviani said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gruff, lean and balding, Ellison is skittish about public attention. He wants 
to have his say every so often in political advertisements and letters to the 
editor, and leave it at that. 
</P>
<P>
 But the nature of his business -- and his family's pioneer role in it -- have 
prompted a series of television and newspaper reporters to knock at his door. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had lots of stories," Ellison said in a recent interview. "You name it 
-- NBC, CBS, '60 Minutes,' 'The Today Show.' . . . It's a big pain in the ass." 
</P>
<P>
 The theme of those stories, including a 1987 investigation by The Times, has 
been that private thrift store operators such as Ellison use charities' names 
to collect tax-deductible donations of clothes and household goods, then sell 
them for large profits, most of which go into the pockets of the operators and 
not the programs of charities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Times' investigation found that private thrift store operators nationwide 
typically made $1.50 for each $1 the charities got. Ellison, his extended 
family and the Ellisons' former employees dominate the private thrift store 
industry, The Times found. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Ray Ellison's case, the charities generally have not complained about 
the revenue they receive from the stores he owns or manages for them. They say 
their share of profits is higher than industry standards. For instance, charity 
profits reach about $1.45 million a year -- about two-thirds of the total 
profit -- at five stores owned by the Disabled American Veterans organization 
of Colorado and operated by Ellison. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ray runs the Cadillac of the thrift store management," said Fred Friedrich, 
president of the DAV's Colorado thrift store committee. "The guy's good. He's 
got a lot of respect out here." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison's Ventura-based M & M Management wrote checks totaling $7 million to 
veterans' groups last year, including $4 million in profit from the 28 stores, 
he said. He won't say how much his company earned, but he has prospered. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison and his family valued M & M at $5 million in 1985, according to public 
records. His two sons, Matthew and Mark, and the husbands of his two daughters 
all work in the family business, Ellison said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison's 142-acre ranch just north of Ventura is for sale for $3 million. He 
has a condominium in Colorado, where he spends summers and holidays. His family 
owns most of the 28 stores they operate. He's a real estate developer in Texas, 
where he recently sold 40 acres to Wal-Mart, and in Washington state, where 
he's building a 180-house subdivision and shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison's prosperity is surely greater than he could have imagined as a 
Depression-era son of a Salvation Army officer. As a boy, he said he struggled 
in school because of frequent family moves along the West Coast, and dropped 
out in ninth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But he began to learn the skills that would make him rich. He remembers 
watching his parents directing teams of men sorting salvaged goods for the 
Salvation Army. 
</P>
<P>
 Family lore credits his mother, Stella, with coining the term "thrift shop" as 
the Ellisons helped the Salvation Army transform its bulk salvage operation 
into a retail one in the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually Ellison's father, Orlo, and four uncles all entered the private 
thrift store business. But it was young Ray and one uncle who Ellison said 
started the first private thrift store 46 years ago in Santa Ana with $3,500. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1965, Ellison, who lived in Ventura briefly in 1947, had returned to the 
city with his wife, Sue, a Westmont College graduate, to raise his two sons and 
two daughters, Ellison said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Ellison has left a legacy of hard work and hard feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in semi-retirement, the Montana-born Ellison said it is not uncommon for 
him to arrive at M & M's national accounting office on Main Street in Ventura 
by 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get your buns out of bed, get your work done before the traffic gets too 
heavy, then go home and enjoy your family," Ellison once wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent written statement, Ellison described his children and their 
spouses, all Ventura residents, as loving and hard working. "Neither they, or 
my wife and I attend social functions, bridge parties, or have our names 
associated in any way with playing Santa Claus. Our lives focus around our 
families, church, friends and business," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such tendencies, Ellison has become well known, first as the Ventura 
Keys homeowner who led a successful seven-year legal battle against the Ventura 
Port District to force dredging at the mouth of Ventura Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1968 case cost Ellison $50,000 in fees, but is now cited in law school 
textbooks as an example of a citizen forcing government to keep its word, he 
said. More recently, he lost two lawsuits that challenged Ventura County's 
General Plan and rezoning policies because of changes he claimed lowered the 
value of his ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no use for people who lie or abuse their authority to rule over me," 
he said in a written explanation of the lawsuits. "I give due respect to every 
type of authority until that body proves unworthy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison's dramatic public entry into Ventura politics came in 1984, when he 
warned the Ventura City Council not to appoint attorney Dennis Orrock mayor, 
then attacked Orrock so tenaciously that the new mayor asked the council to 
appoint an ethics committee to investigate the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 On one large sign he placed near a freeway on-ramp, Ellison wrote: "For sale 
cheap, slightly used mayor. Outstanding qualifications. Unethical. Deceitful. 
Lies Frequently." 
</P>
<P>
 "I still have the sign," Ellison said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison claimed Orrock, who years before had represented Ellison and other 
investors in an ill-fated business deal, knew or should have known that the 
deal's promoter had failed elsewhere with similar proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Orrock denied the accusation. And after hours of testimony, all carried on 
local cable television at Ellison's expense, the ethics committee cleared 
Orrock of any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the first time it got nasty," remembered John McWherter, a 
councilman for 18 years ending in 1991. "That was the first time that a 
personal vendetta had come into City Council politics." 
</P>
<P>
 Orrock said he has not seen or spoken with Ellison since. And despite the 
"hurtful memories," he even jokes about the experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1984, he elevated me to one of 10 movers and shakers in the area, because 
I was on the front page of the newspaper for 23 days," Orrock said. "I don't 
know what motivates Mr. Ellison. The guy is kind of an enigma." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison said his motive was that Orrock was not fit to be mayor. The hearings 
were a whitewash, Ellison said, but that was OK because Orrock did not seek 
another council term. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my intention that he never run again for anything," Ellison said. "I 
didn't care about the (lost investment). The money didn't mean squat. I cared 
about who would represent the city." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, Ellison took on Pati Longo. The councilwoman -- whose politics were 
conservative and pro-business like Orrock's and Ellison's -- had defended 
Orrock in his squabble with Ellison. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison bought a series of newspaper ads attacking her as a phony who had lied 
to the grand jury. He cited her admissions that she had been evasive when asked 
if she'd discussed the closed-door proceedings with others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured the public had a right to know, because she would have been mayor," 
Ellison said. 
</P>
<P>
 Longo, who lost her bid for reelection, said she thinks Ellison's reason for 
challenging both her and Orrock, and in opposing Villeneuve in 1991 and Collart 
last year, was to improve Monahan's chances of being mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ray Ellison's motivation was that Jim Monahan had always been his resident 
politician," Longo said. So when Monahan had a chance at the mayoralty, Ellison 
attacked the favorite, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Villeneuve said he also sees a connection between Ellison's attacks and 
Monahan's political fortunes and agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "His interest in politics is in the form of personal vendetta for somebody he 
disagrees with in ideology or most often in a very personal sense," Villeneuve 
said. "He attempts to parallel his protege, Jim Monahan. I've had to sit and 
listen to Jim Monahan extolling the virtues of Ray Ellison. It's almost hero 
worship." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Monahan and Ellison said they are friends who generally see eye-to-eye 
politically. Ellison will occasionally check with Monahan on issues, they said. 
Ellison said he doesn't follow politics closely and will ask Monahan about his 
reelection plans and the voting records of other council members. But he said 
he doesn't ask Monahan's advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that Jim can fill me in if I'm wrong on how somebody has voted," 
Ellison said. "I don't even take the (local) newspaper. I don't go to council 
meetings any more. I haven't for many years. I can get behind on my facts. So I 
call Jim, or somebody else, but normally Jim." 
</P>
<P>
 Monahan said he has never recommended who Ellison should oppose or support in 
an election. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, he knows how to make up his own mind," the councilman said. 
"Ray's the kind of guy who's a loner. He does everything on his own." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Monahan said Ellison has helped Ventura politics by bringing information to 
voters, but he said he didn't care for the recent fish ads, and thought the 
Orrock hearings were an unnecessary "dog-and-pony show. That was a sad day for 
everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 If Ellison opposed Orrock and Longo for perceived ethical shortcomings, he 
said he opposed Villeneuve two years ago and Collart, Tuttle and 
environmentalist challenger Steve Bennett this year because he did not agree 
with their politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're discouraging almost carte blanche what needs to be done to rejuvenate 
the city. What it amounts to is no growth," he said. "They don't allow anything 
that will generate money. They spend hundreds of thousands of dollars on stupid 
studies." 
</P>
<P>
 That was as detailed as Ellison got in critiques of his political opponents 
during two recent interviews. He had trouble remembering what he had written 
about them in campaign ads. At one point, he read his Villeneuve ad to refresh 
his memory about the councilman's principal flaws. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's see what I had to say here," he said. "Well, yeah, I did look up his 
votes. I ought to keep this crap (advertisements). . . . I don't remember them. 
I just make them up and forget about them." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Villeneuve ads -- as with his fish ads -- Ellison stated his 
pro-business philosophy and lashed his "liberal" opponents. He said his 
colorful headlines were only a way to grab voters so they will read his full 
message. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to get people's attention," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He does that. For example, in a Villeneuve ad segment titled "To Wee or Not to 
Wee," Ellison repeated a second-hand comment Villeneuve allegedly made at a 
City Hall urinal during a break in a hearing about dredging the Ventura Keys. 
</P>
<P>
 Villeneuve and former Mayor Richard Francis, who had battled Monahan before 
leaving the council in 1991, said they responded with their own negative 
campaign this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some of their "Anyone but Monahan" ads were more personal and biting than 
Ellison's fish ads, especially a radio spot late in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew his ads were coming," said Francis, a Ventura attorney. "I didn't want 
to start slinging mud, but if mud is going to get slung and you're going to get 
dirty anyway, you may as well get into the fray." 
</P>
<P>
 Monahan doesn't accept that explanation. "Richard Francis took a personal 
attack on me that was far worse than Ray's comments about these other three," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does Monahan think it's fair that Ellison is seen as "the special interest 
in the black hat," while Patagonia, an environmentalist clothing company that 
spent about $15,000 in the last campaign, "is seen as the special interest in 
the white hat." 
</P>
<P>
 Patagonia owner Yvon Chouinard "doesn't give a damn about anybody else's 
business but his own," Monahan said. "Ray Ellison cares about everybody's 
business, and he's willing to stick his neck out for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Patagonia spokesman Paul Tebbel said the big difference between the two is 
that Patagonia endorses candidates positively, while Ellison attacks them 
personally. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's strongly within his rights to do that," Tebbel said, "I just hate to see 
Ventura politics reduced to who can put out the strongest negative ad." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison did also buy some endorsement ads last fall, backing Measures, Monahan 
and Clark Owens. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Ellison has had much impact on election results is an open question. 
Longo, Villeneuve and Collart, who all lost their races after Ellison's 
criticisms, think he has. Tuttle, who placed only fourth last fall, does too. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, including McWherter and Monahan, said that Longo, Villeneuve and 
Collart were vulnerable anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 As for himself, Ellison thinks his types of ads work. "I think it's very 
effective," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison said he recognizes the personal pain his ads may cause. Public 
criticism following news stories about his thrift stores has hurt his family 
too, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel sorry about that," he said. "They all have kids. Just like our kids 
went to school and had to put up with having negative things said about their 
dad. It's hard on them. But they become accustomed to it over a period of time. 
. . . It goes with the territory." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Ellison felt compelled to write a letter of explanation to Collart shortly 
after the councilman lost in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "I imagine you consider me a callous and insensitive disgrace to society," 
Ellison wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he respected Collart and considered him truthful. "I wish you well, 
apologize if you took personal offense to my methods, and thank you for your 
service," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 But within the same letter may be an indication of things to come during the 
campaign of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 While praising Collart for being true to campaign promises, Ellison chastised 
those "who forgot . . . what they were elected to do." He pointedly mentioned 
Mayor Tom Buford and former Mayor Greg Carson as examples of two who have 
"breached their stated positions." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Carson and Buford, both originally backed by the business community, have been 
criticized by some businessmen for votes over the last two years. And Ellison 
referred to Carson in his fish ads as a weak conservative enticed by liberals 
with the promise of the mayor's job. 
</P>
<P>
 Nursery owner Carson, who describes himself as a moderate and insists he's 
broken no promises, said he first felt Ellison's sting after council members 
chose him mayor two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison immediately telephoned Carson to tell him he had considered him "a 
nice young man," but now believed he was a jerk, Carson said. "He was upset 
because Jim Monahan didn't become mayor." 
</P>
<P>
 Carson said he considers Ellison's ads detrimental to Ventura politics, and he 
said the specter of Ellison would not deter him in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody like Ray Ellison doesn't scare me," Carson said. "If anything, 
people like Ray Ellison would be a reason I would run."

RURAL ENCLAVE OF ONDULANDO OFFERS MAJESTIC VIEWS IN PEACEFUL SETTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tucked away in the Ventura foothills, overlooking lemon and avocado groves, a 
tranquil neighborhood lies secluded from the rest of the city of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 First developed in the 1950s, the upper-middle-class enclave has remained 
rural. There are no sidewalks or street lights here. Coyotes howl at night. 
Skunks and bobcats prowl the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Ondulando -- a quiet, low-crime area, set against the backdrop of the 
Ventura foothills, featuring brush-covered canyons and hillsides. On a clear 
day, residents have panoramic views of the Conejo Grade, the Moorpark hills and 
the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 North of Foothill Road, bordered by Via Cielito on the west and Colina Vista 
on the east, the Ondulando neighborhood contains about 1,010 houses, with a 
population of about 2,840. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents say the drawbacks of hillside living -- occasional mudslides, brush 
fires and marauding coyotes -- are outweighed by the peaceful atmosphere and 
majestic views the neighborhood offers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hasn't changed much," said Ruth Larsen, who moved into Ondulando in 1964. 
"It's quiet, private and the view is just magnificent." 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen and her husband, Lloyd, were attracted to Ondulando by the view of the 
Pacific. Their house rests on one of the undulating hills for which the area 
apparently was named. The Larsens have added a patio out back so they can 
easily enjoy the vista, and one wall of their one-story house is made of glass. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you get your binoculars out, you can see my ship come in," said Lloyd 
Larsen, a retired Navy captain. "On a clear day, you can see out to the Channel 
Islands." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have houses with expansive views tend to add patios, French doors 
and large windows to show them off, said interior designer Jone Pence, who has 
worked on several houses in the Ondulando neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The contractors were not thinking of the view when they built these houses," 
Pence said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Gallagher, who has lived on Via Cielito for 17 years, said she has long 
been frustrated by the fact that her house, which has an ocean view, has few 
windows facing west. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had one window in the back that overlooked the neighbor's house," 
Gallagher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, the 60-year-old homemaker is investing thousands of dollars in 
an extensive remodeling project. Contractors are installing four French doors, 
a large bay window in the kitchen and another large window in the dining room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Views are important," said Gallagher, looking out at the Ventura flatlands 
and the Pacific Ocean from her back yard. "I was brought up on a ranch, so I'm 
not used to living closed in." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Gateley, a real estate agent who has lived in Ondulando for more than 
three years, says the neighborhood also is blessed with pleasant weather. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sun is up here," Gateley said. "There aren't a lot of foggy days. This 
place has an ambience all its own. You have a wooded feeling up here." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Gateley said property values in the neighborhood have decreased the 
past two years because of the recession, houses have dramatically increased in 
value during the past few decades, longtime residents said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Larsens, who bought their house for $29,500 in 1964, estimate it is now 
worth more than $300,000. According tS. Census figures, the median value for a 
house in Ondulando is $380,600. 
</P>
<P>
 But hillside luxury comes at a price. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallagher remembers one particularly intense rainy season that caused half of 
her back yard to tumble down the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to have a tractor come and bring all this dirt back up," she said. 
After that, "We planted the entire back with several rows of oleanders to help 
stabilize the soil. We haven't had any troubles since." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents say mudslides have not been a big problem lately because, during the 
drought, the brush on the hillsides sprouted heavily and rooted the soil 
firmly. 
</P>
<P>
 Flooding isn't the neighbors' only fear. Residents worry about fires sweeping 
down the hillsides and burning their homes, especially when the Santa Ana winds 
blow. During the Steckel Park fire in October, many residents eyed their 
hillsides anxiously, hoping the Santa Paula blaze would not come too close. 
Some watered down their roofs, just in case. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Department officials say they pay special attention to the Ondulando area 
because it has a high number of wood shake roofs and highly flammable trees 
such as eucalyptus and pine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to get special insurance for our roof," said Karen Ruznicka, who has a 
wood shake roof on her two-story house. "These houses were built before they 
outlawed wood shake roofs." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Residents are required to clear their roofs of needles, twigs and other 
combustibles. They also must clear a 100-foot area around their homes and trim 
shrubs and trees that hang over their houses.

 Kathy Taylor, the city's weed abatement officer, says Ondulando residents have 
a very high compliance rate. If homeowners do not clear their brush properly, 
Fire Department officials will do it and bill residents, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We only did six mandatory weed abatements last year," Taylor said. "Ondulando 
is unique in that it has so many pine trees. They're very, very combustible." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruznicka, a manager for a greeting card company who moved into the 
neighborhood in 1988, said coyotes are more of a threat than fires. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost a cat to coyotes, and our next-door neighbor lost a dog," Ruznicka 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ondulando residents, many of whom keep their pets indoors, say they can hear 
the coyotes howling most nights. Bobcats occasionally have been seen roaming 
the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Kate Rodarty, who has lived in the neighborhood 17 years, said she smelled a 
skunk about two weeks ago and has seen snakes and possums in her yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's weird, you don't even see birds in L. A., much less wildlife like 
coyotes," said Susan Outwater, a 34-year-old homemaker who moved from Van Nuys 
into Ondulando two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 An urban refugee, Outwater says she enjoys the quiet neighborhood and the low 
crime rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Vomund, a 57-year-old surgical nurse, said, "I have no qualms about 
walking my dog after dark." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents said the most recent violent incident occurred about a year ago when 
a 16-year-old killed a jogger on Via Arroyo while driving under the influence 
of a drug. 
</P>
<P>
 Teresa Ryan, who moved in five years ago, said she doesn't permit her children 
to play on the street because many motorists take the winding streets in 
Ondulando too quickly. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Although there is no formal Neighborhood Watch program, residents say they 
watch out for each other and call police if they see suspicious strangers in 
their community. Police say there have only been six reported residential 
burglaries in Ondulando this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ondulando is not accessible to burglars," said Maxine Allen, Ventura police 
crime analyst. "There are only two streets in and out of the neighborhood, and 
burglars want to make a quick getaway. Calls for service are relatively low 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the houses in Ondulando have security systems, which may also deter 
burglars, Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood, on the average, is more affluent than the rest of Ventura. 
Median household income is near $66,000, and 40% of the households have annual 
incomes over $75,000, according to U. S. Census figures. Citywide, median 
household income is $40,307, and 15% have incomes over $75,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ondulando Club, a small clubhouse built in the 1950s, has a membership of 
about 100 from the neighborhood and about 80 from outside Ondulando. 
Neighborhood residents pay a one-time initiation fee of $350 and monthly dues 
of $40; non-residents are charged a $400 initiation fee and monthly dues of 
$50. 
</P>
<P>
 The club has tennis courts, volleyball courts and a swimming pool. It is a 
popular neighborhood spot for birthday parties, pool parties and other social 
gatherings, club President Ed Keay said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason I moved into the Ondulando neighborhood is that it has a family 
feeling, and the clubhouse is part of that," Keay said. "The newer 
neighborhoods are kind of sterile and give you that development feel." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Hawk, a 35-year-old carpenter who has lived in Ondulando for five years, 
described his neighbors as "more white collar than blue collar." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to census figures, 48.7% of those employed are professionals. 
Education levels in the neighborhood are also higher than the rest of the city. 
Census data shows 96.6% of residents 25 and older have high school diplomas, 
and 43% have bachelor's degrees. Citywide, 84% have high school diplomas and 
24% have bachelor's degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Benton, a local political consultant, said the Ondulando neighborhood 
historically has a reputation for being politically active. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia Weber, who lives in the neighborhood, ran unsuccessfully for City 
Council in November. Councilman Jim Monahan, who has been elected to the 
council five times, has lived there since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the Republicans try to get the Ondulando vote," Benton said. "The 
pro-business candidates always walk the Ondulando area." 
</P>
<P>
 Poinsettia Elementary School, where many Ondulando parents send their 
children, has one of the most active parent organizations in the city, said 
Arlene Miro, director of administrative services for the Ventura Unified School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 She also said children at Poinsettia have scored higher than the citywide 
average on reading and math tests. "Research shows that when parents are 
interested in what their children are doing, their children tend to do better," 
Miro said. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1991, parents at Poinsettia -- some of them from the Ondulando 
neighborhood -- persuaded school district officials to exempt the elementary 
school from a sweeping realignment plan. Hillside residents were allowed to 
keep their children at Buena High School instead of busing them across town to 
Ventura High. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents from the Montalvo community -- who must send their children past Buena 
to Ventura High -- accused the school board of catering to the wishes of the 
affluent hillside communities, but Miro said it was not a politically motivated 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The busing fuss was one of the few political issues that have stirred the 
normally sedate neighborhood recently. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Phyllis Luyken, a 72-year-old retired elementary school teacher, 
calls her neighborhood dull. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's boring," said Luyken, who has lived there 17 years. "When you go on a 
walk, you don't see a soul. And there's absolutely no public transportation. If 
you don't have a car, you're dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Luyken, a widow, said she is thinking about selling her two-story house 
because it is too large for her. But she acknowledged that she would miss her 
quiet neighborhood if she moved. 
</P>
<P>
 Her house is the edge of a hill, with views of the valley below and the ocean, 
which Luyken looks at when she practices tai chi. 
</P>
<P>
 "The view is uplifting, it's magnificent," Luyken said, pointing at the 
horizon. "That's why people move here." Ondulando at a Glance

PIERCE COLLEGE FARMLAND ISSUE IS MISUNDERSTOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I read once again, in a Dec. 5 letter to the editor, that "there are 
persistent rumors that the farmland will be sold" at Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
 I have been the president of Pierce College for 2 1/2 years.During that time I 
have never once heard any official of the college or the Los Angeles Community 
College District give any consideration whatsoever to the sale of any of Pierce 
College's land.  
</P>
<P>
 What has been discussed is how Pierce College is going to be able to survive 
the current financial crisis. And what friends of the Canada geese and the farm 
must understand is that our college receives money to educate students and for 
no other purpose. To the extent that the farmland contributes to the education 
of students, we will support it as we do any laboratory experience. 
</P>
<P>
 What we are trying to determine is how to secure funding so we can continue to 
devote all of our acreage to educational, agricultural and recreational 
pursuits. We are considering a number of possibilities, including a special 
taxation district, private endowment and expanded agricultural activities. For 
now we are not considering joint ventures, such as a golf course. We are 
limiting any such consideration to the area near our gymnasiums, not on the 
farmland.

AGENCIES TOO CHOOSY ABOUT VOLUNTEERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I strongly disagree with Sandy Doerschlag's article about the need for 
volunteers at nonprofit agencies in the San Fernando Valley (Valley Commentary, 
Dec. 26). 
</P>
<P>
 I am a high school junior who has been looking for a volunteer job to fulfill 
a California Scholarship Federation requirement. I was willing to do anything. 
I was not looking for a glamorous job. Everyone I called turned me down because 
they wanted a long-term commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems to me that the agencies and hospitals would want people regardless of 
how much time is given. I finally got a job after my grandmother, who is a 
volunteer, begged her boss for a volunteer job for me.

BANNING GUNS GIVES THUGS THE ADVANTAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It was only by suspending my belief in reality that I could read the Times 
editorial titled "Lesson of Chatsworth Shooting" (Dec. 17). 
</P>
<P>
 Gabriel Gettleson, 17, was shot and wounded outside Chatsworth High School 
when he defended himself against robbery. Your solution was the near total ban 
on guns. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the connection? If Gettleson had been stabbed, would you have called 
for a near total ban on guns? If he had been beaten unconscious with a box 
wrench, would you have called for a near total ban on guns? 
</P>
<P>
 Maimed is maimed, and dead is dead. Banning guns shifts the advantage from 
honest citizens to criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Look, let's get real. Anytime someone is surrounded by three thugs, that 
person is in trouble. It doesn't matter what arms the thugs have -- they are 
going to do whatever they want to the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 And in general, even one thug with a knife or a wrench can be a very real 
threat to one honest citizen. Civilization is supposed to enhance the power of 
honest citizens versus thugs. To date, the best that has been obtained is a 
one-on-one equality: The protection afforded a citizen by a gun equalizes the 
threat from a group of thugs armed with lesser weapons. Thugs avoid 
confrontations in which their personal danger equals their intended victim's. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why armed citizens are avoided by thugs. It's not that the group of 
thugs would not succeed, but that at least one of the thugs would get shot. 
</P>
<P>
 No, I didn't forget the role of the police. They are not personal bodyguards. 
They just plain are not around when you need them. They catch thugs -- 
sometimes -- after the crime has been committed. The sad truth is that the 
small minority of armed private citizens does a better job of preventing crime 
than is done by the designated guardians of our lives and property. 
</P>
<P>
 A disarmed citizenry can be set upon with impunity and at will by roving bands 
of thugs. Is that what you want? A general revival of thuggery? A kind of 
highwayman's paradise?

PEOPLE FEAR CRIME REGARDLESS OF SOURCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re: Sam Enriquez's "Middle Class Despairs Over Paradise Lost," (Dec. 19). 
</P>
<P>
 Enriquez correctly identifies the Valley's shrinking white majority but 
incorrectly identifies vanishing jobs and rising crime as a white problem.It is 
everyone's problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Enriquez's article, the most basic complaint is about Valley crime. 
</P>
<P>
 I am Latino and lived much of my childhood in one of Los Angeles' poorer 
neighborhoods -- one of those neighborhoods that Angelenos avoid. However, I 
remember that in the 1950s and early 1960s, not one of our neighbors locked 
their doors. Leaving the house meant that you locked the front door but the 
back door remained unlocked. In those days, poor just meant poor. Poor did not 
mean crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The overwhelming majority of people couldn't care less if a black, white or 
Latino person lives next door. The vast majority of people actually welcome the 
diversity. They hate and fear the crime, whomever it comes from.

SHOULD COYOTE TRAPPING RESUME OR SHOULD THEY BE LEFT ALONE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I found Bill Bialosky's assertion that "this city has an obligation to 
protect . . . our pets" amazing (Valley Commentary, Dec. 26). Even a cursory 
examination of local news attests to the fact that revenues are diminishing. 
Should we really expect taxpayers to pay for trapping and killing coyotes on a 
regular basis to protect the pets of some individuals? 
</P>
<P>
 I attended the community meeting a few weeks ago at El Camino High School. A 
representative from the city animal regulation authorities stated that the 
overriding consideration for elimination of the trapping program was financial. 
It was pointed out that area residents are free to hire a state-licensed 
trapper to capture and kill coyotes in their yards. It soon became clear that a 
vocal group of residents were averse to taking responsibility, financial or 
otherwise, for their pets. They want the taxpayers to foot the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is, coyotes are not a danger to humans. Do we really have a need, 
much less a right, to demand that they be killed because we don't want to be 
bothered to watch our pets or small children? 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 * Early this morning, my son came into the kitchen and told me to go out and 
count my chickens, as there had been a disturbance at 4:36 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, another fowl was missing. It was my elderly, retired hen, the 
lone survivor of a flock of golden nugget layers that once strutted and clucked 
in my back yard and kept us in fresh eggs. She was the third nocturnal casualty 
of this bitter season. 
</P>
<P>
 After the rooster and two of my neighbor's roosters and one of their fat 
mallard ducks vanished in the night, after we found a severed chicken leg 
partially buried beneath one of my sycamores, after that grisly souvenir also 
vanished in the night, an officer of the Department of Animal Regulation 
visited us, examined our yard and the evidence, found a few canine tracks and 
some telltale marks on our fences, the problem was diagnosed: "Coyotes," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also informed us of several daylight sightings of these predators. One of 
them was especially alarming, as it involved a wild canine stalking a toddler 
near Calvert Street and Valley Circle Boulevard, a location well north of the 
U.S. 101 and Ventura Boulevard. I also live well north of these arteries. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, I don't suppose the commissioners of the Department of Animal Regulation 
really care about my innocent little white chickens. However, I do imagine they 
might care about the possibility of a coyote attack upon an equally innocent 
human child, and if they don't care directly about the child itself, then 
perhaps these commissioners care enough about their own backsides to choose to 
avoid a future accusation of having ignored or tolerated an unacceptable risk 
to public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 I am suggesting that the commissioners need to balance the interests involved 
and reverse the error of their predecessors, who assumed that the position of 
animal rights lobbyists was correct without any critical investigation 
whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
 P.S. -- I wrote the above on Dec. 26. I went out Jan. 3 to feed my shrinking 
flock of chickens and discovered new carnage. Strewn on the ground were masses 
of snowy feathers and the partly dismembered remains of all my silky chickens. 
Now I have none.

 * People who want us to make way for relentless urban sprawl by savagely 
killing coyotes are engaging in a classic exercise in shortsightedness. 
</P>
<P>
 There were human beings on this planet living together socially 20,000 years 
ago. They came and went without leaving much of a trace. But we might wonder 
what life will be like for our progeny in Southern California 20,000 years from 
now. Will there be no wild lands or animals left? Will the surface of the Earth 
become one continuous city? How will our descendants feel about their 
ancestors? 
</P>
<P>
 Human beings are not a separate case of creation outside of nature. We are an 
intrinsic part of nature, as are the few remaining coyotes, foxes and cougars 
struggling to survive in the dwindling woodlands and chaparral. When we kill 
them, we only diminish ourselves and our future.

CRIME IN THE VALLEY: SOME CLUES BEHIND THE NUMBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The good news is that there was less crime in the San Fernando Valley in 1993 
than there was the year before. Still, it was difficult to find comfort in the 
numbers. That's because crime in 1993 involved a particularly bad blend of 
extremes and senselessness. 
</P>
<P>
 An elderly man died at the hands of a carjacker while on a simple errand to 
refuel his vehicle at a gas station. A pregnant Toluca Lake woman was knifed to 
death at an automated teller machine in Sherman Oaks. And who would have 
imagined that a mother picking up her daughter from a Bible study class in 
Northridge would be shot to death in front of her son, even after she had 
surrendered her purse to robbers. 
</P>
<P>
 There was cause for concern in what ought to have been the most routine and 
previously worry-free matters, such as sending children off to school in the 
morning -- and leaving them there. Parents fretted over a sex offender who 
preyed on children in the northeast Valley, a serial child molester operating 
in the West Valley who remains at large, and campus shootings that left a 
Reseda High School student dead and a Chatsworth High School student seriously 
wounded. The latter was shot because his attackers apparently wanted his book 
bag. 
</P>
<P>
 The unease created by such inexplicable mayhem was no doubt accentuated by the 
burgeoning problem of graffiti vandalism. It served as a constant reminder of 
neighborhoods under siege. 
</P>
<P>
 AND OVER THE LONGER TERM, CRIME IS STILL UP: But there was substance in the 
fear. It was backed up by the fact that Valley crime is still a much greater 
problem than it was five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, for example, there were roughly nine homicides per month in the 
Valley. Through November, 1993, the average was 11 per month. Divide the time 
involved in every 24-hour period by the frequency and types of crime and you 
are left with the following facts: On average, a rape occurred every 17 hours 
in the Valley in the first 11 months of 1993, an increase of 14% over 1988. A 
robbery occurred every 76 minutes last year. 
</P>
<P>
 That rate represented an increase of 43% over 1988. A case of aggravated 
assault occurred every 49 minutes, a 30% rise over 1988. Burglaries took place 
nearly every half hour, an increase of 9%, and a car was stolen every 26 
minutes, up 12% from five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 WHAT HAS BEEN LEARNED, AND WHAT CAN BE DONE: If Valley voters are not kicking 
themselves for helping to defeat a modest property-tax increase last April that 
would have beefed up the Los Angeles Police Department by about 1,000 officers, 
they ought to be. That's because there were countless reminders in 1993 of just 
how understaffed and under-equipped the LAPD really is. Consider one 
particularly disturbing example involving that serial child molester. There 
might well be several likely suspects among the 20,198 registered sex offenders 
in the county, but there's a problem. "We at this time don't have a system that 
tracks registered sex offenders," said an LAPD spokesman assigned to the task 
force tracking the molester. "At one time, we were trying to develop one, but 
it had to be scrapped for lack of funds." 
</P>
<P>
 What should Valley residents do? The answer, in part, is that they should 
carefully weigh Mayor Richard Riordan's and Chief Willie Williams' ambitious 
plan to modernize and increase the size of the LAPD, and they ought to be 
prepared to pay a fair price for it. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also learned that the LAPD and school-based security officials need to 
do a far better job of communicating with each other when similar crimes occur. 
That might have helped discern the serial child molester's pattern much 
earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 A WELCOME AND NECESSARY RESOLVE: There were several laudable examples last 
year in which residents here decided to play a role in making their communities 
safer. It was seen in the case of hundreds of volunteers fanning out to 
distribute flyers warning families about the child molester, in those who were 
willing to provide a ride or an escort to a child on his or her way to school. 
There were community members who went beyond the usual role of Neighborhood 
Watch groups to walk their streets and report suspicious behavior to 
authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 It was found in the work of the Community Tagger Task Force, made up of about 
300 Valley volunteers who have used privately raised funds to photograph 
graffiti vandals and pass the information on to police. 
</P>
<P>
 It was seen in the fearlessness of folks like Viviana Guerra of North 
Hollywood, whose court testimony has sent five gang members to jail, and Hannah 
Dyke of Sylmar, who apprehended taggers referred by the courts to clean up the 
mess they have made. 
</P>
<P>
 Such involvement is badly needed and may help authorities roll back crime to 
even lower levels than those recorded five years ago. A Rising Tide 
</P>

CHRISTMAS TREE TRAGEDIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon wants all of the city's Christmas 
tree vendors to warn buyers about the fire dangers of the trees. We have a 
thought or two on the subject as well. 
</P>
<P>
 If your Christmas tree is still up, you ought to get rid of it properly, like 
now. There is a simple rule of thumb here. If running your hand along a branch 
creates a cascade of falling pine needles, you've got a tree that is ready to 
burn with little prompting. That has occurred with surprising frequency of 
late. 
</P>
<P>
 Fires that began when dried-out Christmas trees ignited like so much seasoned 
kindling have claimed the lives of three children over the recent holiday 
season, including a 3-year-old Sylmar boy. An older brother apparently was 
playing with a lighted candle near the tree when it caught fire. Sixteen other 
people also were injured in tree-related blazes that damaged seven homes around 
Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the injured was a firefighter who was attempting to extinguish a fire in 
Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 Requiring a safety talk by the tree sellers hardly sounds unreasonable, 
especially with the image of the Southern California wildfires so fresh in our 
minds.

A FITTING RESOLUTION; $1.2 MILLION WOULD REWARD A CRIME VICTIM'S COURAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It would make a fitting and long-awaited reward for a most courageous witness. 
</P>
<P>
 That is how a recommendation made on Tuesday by a Los Angeles City Council 
committee ought to be viewed in the unfortunate case of former North Hollywood 
theater owner George Carpenter. The council's budget and finance committee has 
suggested a $1.2-million award to Carpenter, who was critically wounded after 
Los Angeles police failed to warn him about a threat that had been made on his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter and a colleague were robbed at gunpoint in 1984 as they were about 
to deposit the day's receipts at a San Fernando Valley bank. It was an 
experience made all the more frightening because one of his assailants said 
something to the effect of "shoot them anyway," even after they had 
relinquished the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he could testify, Carpenter was critically wounded by a gunman who 
later turned out to be one of the robbery suspects. The shooting had been an 
attempt to prevent Carpenter from testifying, and it left him with permanent 
facial nerve damage and other injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter changed his name and moved away from California, returning only to 
testify against his assailant, but there is more to this story. 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out that Los Angeles police investigators had learned that the 
robbery suspect had tried to solicit a contract murder on Carpenter to prevent 
his testimony. Carpenter was never warned or offered protection. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, the 2nd District Court of Appeals last year found the city 
liable for Carpenter's injuries. In the process, the court rightly said that 
police officials carried a higher responsibility for warning witnesses about 
the threats they face for testifying in criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, wants a report on what the LAPD would do 
now to warn witnesses. The department should respond promptly to the request. 
The tale of Carpenter's courage will inspire other citizens to do their share 
to fight crime. The LAPD's failure to warn him discourages such inspiration, 
and justifies that tidy award.

EXPANSION OF LANDFILL A BETTER CHOICE IN LONG RUN; ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS OF 
SUNSHINE CANYON PROJECT OUTWEIGH THE COSTS. THE LAND HAS ALREADY BEEN DEGRADED, 
AND SITE'S OPERATOR IS OFFERING A LONG LIST OF MITIGATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON P. MULLALLY, Don P. Mullally of Granada Hills, a biologist, retired 
teacher and retired city parks supervisor, is a member of the Sierra Club, 
Audubon Society and Wilderness Society. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For years, the proposed expansion of the landfill in Sunshine Canyon, owned 
and operated by Browning Ferris Industries Inc., has been among the most 
contentious issues in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a pity, because the environmental objections to it are more than 
offset by the environmental arguments in its favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Lobbying continues to be intense despite setbacks to opponents of the landfill 
by decisions of the Superior Court, the state Court of Appeal, the county 
planning department, state and county sanitation departments and the county 
supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition stems mainly from the North Valley Coalition and Councilman Hal 
Bernson, who has generally been backed by his council colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion would eradicate 200 acres of woodland and savanna. In a 
worst-case scenario, following other expansions, most of Sunshine Canyon would 
eventually become a landfill. Some 400 to 500 acres of wilderness would be 
lost. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the canyon is already degraded by the present closed landfill and 
extensive earth moving. Few people wish to use it for recreational purposes. 
The acres to be lost are a minor part of the small but growing Santa Clarita 
Woodlands Park, eventually proposed for 8,000 acres. If the smaller acreage is 
lost to the landfill, the rest of the park can go forward as public funds 
become available to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy to buy land. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sunshine Canyon does not have valley oak, an endangered species which exists 
on and near the crest of the range from near Mission Point to the west flanks 
of Oat Mountain, a distance of 5 1/2 miles. Rare vegetation dominated by 
flowering ash trees occurs in surrounding canyons but is absent from Sunshine 
Canyon. Its most striking trees are the big-cone Douglas fir, which also exists 
in East, Rice and Bee canyons. In addition, BFI is raising young firs for 
future planting. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists such as myself are not eager supporters of this or any other 
landfill. Those who approve of this expansion do so because of the long list of 
mitigations offered or accepted by BFI and the hazards of ridgeline development 
that will occur if the landfill is rejected.  
</P>
<P>
 One important mitigating factor is BFI's offer to donate more than 950 acres 
of wilderness land for parks in Weldon, East, Rice, Bee and Sunshine canyons. 
The offer includes: 
</P>
<P>
 * Forest near the top of Sunshine Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 * Land surrounding Sunshine Canyon on the north, west and south. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sections of the dirt roads known as the motorways, which could be used for 
hiking, biking and horseback riding. 
</P>
<P>
 * A BFI-hired biologist to protect this land and $432,000 for the study of 
county significant ecological areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The land BFI is offering would become part of the Santa Clarita Woodlands 
Park. Its acquisition would thus preempt the attempt by Los Angeles, with 
Bernson's blessings, to annex parts of the summit or ridgeline of the mountain 
range near Sunshine Canyon. Years ago, papers were filed with city and county 
planning departments and the Local Agency Formation Commission for this 
13,000-acre acquisition, called the Oat Mountain Annexation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson has been quoted as supporting low-density development on these 
mountains to protect the environment. The executive committee of the Los 
Angeles Chapter of the Sierra Club opposes the annexation. Those favoring it 
probably do not want a working landfill in Sunshine Canyon, which would reduce 
the chances of development of homes on nearby ridges. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Valley Coalition deserves a world of credit for much of its previous 
work. It proposed the Santa Clarita Woodlands Park -- I was part of the effort, 
in the late 1980s. Its opposition to the landfill pressured BFI to make 
extravagant mitigation. But I must disagree with its intractable position on 
the landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Wise, manager of the landfill, also loves the forests and animal life and 
has been generally cooperative regarding preservation. The deal which we have 
been presented is one of the best of its type ever offered in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 14, the Los Angeles City Council voted to refer the Sunshine Canyon 
case to the state Supreme Court. This means more delays, more public money, 
more destruction of plant life in the forest by cattle -- and more time lost 
from recreation in a beautiful unburned natural area.

TURNING OFF TV GIVES CHILD A NEW VIEW OF LIFE; A MOTHER DECIDES TO PUT AN END 
TO CARTOONS AND EVEN 'SESAME STREET' FOR HER TODDLER. THE RESULT: 'A CALMER, 
MORE IMAGINATIVE BOY WONDERING AT THE WORLD . . . AND A LOT MORE HARD WORK AS A 
PARENT.'

 I'm the mother of a 4-year-old boy, and I am a radical. 
</P>
<P>
 I have shoved Mickey, Donald, Superman, Yogi Bear, Mr. Rogers, Underdog and, 
yes, even "Sesame Street" out of my house. 
</P>
<P>
 I did what I suspect many parents think of doing. I banned the tube, aside 
from a few carefully picked shows on sick days. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought it was a sensible, even innocuous way to control my child's 
environment. But it wasn't long before a friend berated me for not introducing 
my son to Mr. Rogers, thus passing up a chance to infuse moral values into him. 
</P>
<P>
 Another friend dealt the ultimate blow: "You didn't grow up watching TV, so 
you can't understand the importance and magic of Disney cartoons." 
</P>
<P>
 Take a stand against the glow box and people get more animated than they would 
about national defense. Television is the stuff middle America is made of. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, if my child was within earshot of these friendly spats, he chirped, 
"Is TV on now? Let's go to Jimmy's house. He watches TV and he has pink 
Nestle's Quik." 
</P>
<P>
 Why my hostility to TV? Cartoons and children's programs are violent, ugly or 
foolish -- or all three at once. Children 2 to 6 years of age are all energy 
and curiosity, ready to experience everything. It is bad to have them sit, 
watch and shut up. And the electronic pictures are addictive. 
</P>
<P>
 When I want a baby-sitter, I hire a live one. At least my child can interact 
with another human being, ask questions, answer some, take a walk around the 
block.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I did not zap TV immediately. I gave it a chance. For about a year and a half 
I allowed kiddie programs or videos for one hour or less. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sesame Street" seemed a perfect choice. The problem was I got dizzy after 20 
minutes of that restless, chaotic jumble of alphabet, rap, geometrical shapes, 
politically correct diversity and preachy songs about healthy foods. 
</P>
<P>
 My son, formerly a ball of inquisitive energy, turned into a lump of 
transfixed attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Since I did not take haphazard regurgitation of letters as a sign that he had 
learned something, I was not impressed by the educational claims of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Two- and 3-year-olds need grown-ups to show and explain the world to them: the 
taste of cookie dough, the feel of dirt and sand, the smell of flowers and 
dinner cooking. When they are "all grown up," about 6 years old, they'll be 
ready for the alphabet. Until then, they don't need to see it marching by on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Scratch tele-learning. I settled for what I thought was innocent 
entertainment. After all, my child had a right to the wonderful world of 
Disney, Hanna Barbera and Warner Bros. 
</P>
<P>
 Pretty soon it looked as though cartoons had a right to him. Even an 
occasional dose of Donald and his nephews beating up on one another, the 
Roadrunner flattening Coyote, Daffy Duck or Bugs Bunny took root. Youngsters 
might not learn from television, but they will get imprinted. 
</P>
<P>
 I tried damage control. "Coyotes are really quite smart, you know," I said. 
"In fact, if you ever see one, run away." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, Mom, don't worry. I'll kill him with a big stone," my son said. He was 
too young to handle the magic of animation. Besides, I could never forgive 
Tweety Bird for teaching him to pull my cat's tail, making the top of the 
fridge the animal's sole refuge. 
</P>
<P>
 I pulled the plug on TV, and we did a lot of cooking, gardening, painting, 
dressing up, running around and story telling, until my son entered preschool. 
</P>
<P>
 I might have my way in the living-room, but Superman and Batman juniors lurked 
in the schoolyard. My kid quickly saw the light and became one of them, the 
Batman-Turtle gang. Driving home there was big talk, gun noise and mayhem 
coming from the booster seat in the back of the car. 
</P>
<P>
 One no-nonsense mother, more experienced than I was, assured me: "Aggressivity 
is really in them. It's good for them to be exposed to all kinds of behaviors 
and learn to cope. That's what real life is all about. At least the Turtles are 
fighting the bad guys." Never mind that the bad guys were the ones with the 
wrong headband. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I switched to a school where teachers dare ask parents to turn off television. 
When my little Capt. Hook waves his saber too much, I disarm him peacefully by 
hunting with him for magic gold or a lost treasure in the sand, or dressing him 
up in a cape for garden exploration. The all-nasty cartoon version has lost his 
voice, so true fantasy has moved back in. 
</P>
<P>
 I now have a calmer, more imaginative boy wondering at the world . . . and a 
lot more hard work as a parent. 
</P>
<P>
 Once my son is asleep, if the day has left me too exhausted to read, I may 
turn on the television. It's OK -- I know how to shut it off.

OBJECTIONS TO HANSEN DAM PROJECT DON'T HOLD WATER; THE NORTHEAST SAN FERNANDO 
VALLEY DESERVES THE FEDERAL MONEY ALLOCATED FOR PROPOSED RESTORATION. THE PARK 
IS A REGIONAL FACILITY THAT EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT TO USE AND ENJOY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEW SNOW and VICKI SNOW, Lew Snow is immediate past president of the Lake 
View Terrace Home Owners Assn. Vicki Snow is past president of the Valley Horse 
Owners Assn. They are longtime San Fernando Valley residents who own property 
near Hansen Dam. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a few months, work will get under way to re-create one of our family's 
fondest childhood memories: the lake at Hansen Dam. 
</P>
<P>
 As someone who grew up just a couple of blocks away, Vicki remembers how her 
Morgan mare Penny loved taking a swim in the 130-acre lake. One of her first 
jobs as a teen-ager was at the pony rides at the adjacent park. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen Dam was a world away from Lew's childhood in North Hollywood. He used 
to go to the lake to swim and fish. Old-timers tell him the lake was always 
good fishing, but you can't prove it by him. He doesn't remember ever coming 
home with anything but wet clothes and an empty hook. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than 30 years, Holiday Lake at Hansen Dam provided swimming, boating 
and fishing for the burgeoning San Fernando Valley. It inspired people who 
lived in the clusters of homes among orchards and truck farms to name their 
community Lake View Terrace. For low-income and middle-income families like the 
ones we grew up in, it provided low-cost recreation: Along with the pony ride, 
there was a merry-go-around, a train ride and Hansen Dam Stables, where for a 
few bucks you could rent a horse to explore the trails encircling the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it all changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in 1969 and about every three years thereafter, floodwaters from Big 
and Little Tujunga canyons choked the lake with silt and residue. The Army 
Corps of Engineers, which owns the land, and the Los Angeles Department of 
Recreation and Parks, which operates the recreation facilities, threw up their 
hands and failed to dredge the silt. By the mid-1970s, the once huge lake was a 
few acres of muck. Despite a community outcry, the lake was in effect allowed 
to die. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in the mid-1980s, Rep. Howard Berman began applying pressure for 
restoration. He created the 50-member Hansen Dam Advisory Committee, which 
worked with the Army Corps of Engineers to create a master plan. His 
persistence brought commitments of close to $10 million in federal money, 
which, combined with $10 million from a parks bond issue, has made the start of 
construction a reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, a small group of misguided not-in-my-back-yard types and 
ultraconservatives have begun attacking the reconstruction of the lake. Saying 
they want to "stop the madness," they have voiced two basic objections: They 
don't want federal money spent for the construction, and they don't want 
"outsiders" coming to the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither objection is valid. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire northeast San Fernando Valley has long been ignored in allocations 
for federal projects. For this project, a relatively insignificant amount has 
been allocated over the last five years, and part of that came from royalties 
paid by the reclamation contractor at the site. The $10 million represents four 
one-hundred-thousandths of 1% of this year's federal budget deficit, and eight- 
millionths of 1% of the federal budget deficit during those five years. If the 
federal government should miraculously come up with $65 million needed for the 
second phase, a 70-acre boating lake, the second figure will change to 
six-millionths of 1%. Yet in our community the expenditure will have an 
enormous effect, creating jobs and business opportunities and generating 
additional tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We also reject the rhetoric of those who decry the arrival of outsiders to use 
the facility. Hansen Dam Recreation Area was, is and will always be a regional 
park. Just as any Lake View Terrace resident has the right to use any public 
park, anyone may use Hansen Dam. What if other communities opposed outsiders in 
"their" parks? Should local equestrians (many are opposed to the outsiders) be 
barred from trails in the Santa Monica Mountains? Unfortunately, some people 
use outsiders as a code word for individuals of ethnicity and color. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is imperative that the city provide enough money to operate and maintain 
the facility properly. Many residents and the Lake View Terrace Home Owners 
Assn. have been active in that regard. Perhaps those afraid of outsiders should 
redirect their efforts toward working with Rep. Berman, City Councilman Richard 
Alarcon, the Los Angeles Police Department and the city Department of 
Recreation and Parks to help write the best possible plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In scores of meetings in the last 20 years, residents of Lake View Terrace, 
Pacoima, Shadow Hills and Sunland have demanded that the city and the Army 
restore the silted-over lake at Hansen Dam. It would be terrible if misguided 
NIMBYs and ultraconservatives somehow put a halt to this long-awaited project. 
It's a shame that they want to.

 From here to Florida, the bowl games last week separated the title contenders 
from the rest in college football, leaving, as usual, a web of unanswered 
questions, starting with these two: 
</P>
<P>
 What's the best team in the land? 
</P>
<P>
 Should a national championship playoff climax the college season? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer to Question 2 is easy: Sure, starting next year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Question 1 is unanswerable. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if Florida State met Notre Dame or Nebraska again next week, the winner 
wouldn't be the better team, necessarily, let alone best of all. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's leading college football clubs are so closely matched most years 
that nearly any 60-minute happening can be disproportionately influenced by 
turnovers, bad calls, big plays and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 More than one loser can claim: "We were robbed." More than one winner can 
brag: "Look at the scoreboard. We're No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, sports fans who want to settle the best-football-team argument on 
the playing field are asking the impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 So why have a championship game? 
</P>
<P>
 The rationale for that is something else. 
</P>
<P>
 You play it for a reason that is as urgent, as honorable, as American, as it 
is excellent. 
</P>
<P>
 You play it for the money. ROCKY TIMES HAVE AMBUSHED UNIVERSITIES 
</P>
<P>
 In two respects, a January playoff, bringing together the four best teams 
emerging from the bowl games, will someday be as welcome as it is spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
 It will: 
</P>
<P>
 * Create an American classic. With semifinals one weekend and a title event 
the next, three big annual games will be added to the winter sports calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd support a final-four playoff," UCLA Chancellor Charles E. Young said the 
other day. "More games would be too many. One isn't enough." 
</P>
<P>
 * Strengthen American education. With revenues evenly divided, a playoff could 
generate as much as $1 million each year for every school that competes in 
big-time football. 
</P>
<P>
 And they all need it. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are rocky times for (state) schools, and for most private schools, 
too," Richard Little, vice president at Miami University of Ohio, said, voicing 
an opinion that can be heard on any campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The need didn't seem so acute a few years ago -- when there was no real need 
for a championship game, either. College football has been a consistent success 
story without it. 
</P>
<P>
 But there have been major changes lately in the economic condition of the 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Budget problems have led many schools to drop some of their varsity sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Many -- UCLA among them -- have even abolished or downsized academic 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The money just isn't there these days," Little said. "They're phasing out 
departments and degree programs (because) more than half the states have cut 
back on aid to higher education." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that the states have been financially stricken, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (legislature) thinks about us, but they also have to think about 
Medicaid," Little said. "And so many other things: the burgeoning prison 
population, secondary education, infrastructure breakdowns, social-service 
needs. There's a confluence of pressures and problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The universities are responding to the crisis predictably with unprecedented 
increases in tuition and fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas inflation in America rose 2.8% last year, the cost of a college 
education was up 6%, a College Board spokesman said at Princeton. 
</P>
<P>
 The average for tuition, room and meals at all U.S. four-year colleges now is 
$6,207 a year, he said, but the cost rises to $10,000 and up at larger state 
and private schools, and to $25,000 or more at some. 
</P>
<P>
 With such intense pressures on the economy of every university, all possible 
sources of revenue need to be looked at. A football final four would plainly 
help. NFL KIND OF MONEY IS THERE FOR A FINAL FOUR 
</P>
<P>
 Postseason college football has always attracted a number of outspoken 
critics. Football in January, they continue to charge, is crass commercialism. 
</P>
<P>
 What does it have to do with education? they ask. Who needs it? We'd be 
overwhelmed by two weeks of media hoopla and hype. 
</P>
<P>
 But in this case, that's the whole point. 
</P>
<P>
 The more commotion, the better. The nation's troubled universities need 
windfall profits. If hype helps, hype. 
</P>
<P>
 The payoff could be impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL's Super Bowl in recent years has been hyped into a one-day $50-million 
event. It reaps $41 million from TV alone and then sells out at $175 a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 A college football final-four playoff, capitalizing on the nation's post-bowl 
game ferment, could arguably double that -- producing $50 million for the main 
event plus $25 million for each semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 The take from the championship game alone "would be closer to $100 million 
than $50 million," in the opinion of Georgia Athletic Director Vince Dooley. 
</P>
<P>
 Others tend to agree. In both total revenue and excitement, some suggest, a 
final-four playoff might even outpace the NFL's longer playoffs for these 
reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Even taking into account the overlap, there are slightly different publics 
for pro and college ball, both of them very large. 
</P>
<P>
 -- CBS, which has lost the NFL, is in the market for a comparably prestigious 
major league enterprise and could bid against ABC for at least a share of 
college football. 
</P>
<P>
 -- With only three games, a brisk college playoff, going head to head against 
pro football's month-long January playoffs, would offer a compact, competitive 
zing. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday nights, possibly. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, conceivably, the championship game should be played in the NFL's usual bye 
week before the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 As college basketball has found, there's something about a finely focused 
final four that stirs the imagination of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "The instant we have championship football, it will become one of the world's 
four great annual sports events," Dooley, a winning football coach for many 
years, said from Georgia, comparing it to the Super Bowl, World Series and 
college basketball tournament.  
</P>
<P>
 Education would gain the most. It would gain substantially wherever big-time 
football is played. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see the revenue equally divided between academics and athletics 
at each university," Dooley said, proposing a course of action that could well 
be taken, when they come to consider it, by the presidents of the top-division 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 At present in Division I-A, there are 106 football-playing institutions, but 
some of them favor a smaller grouping of about 70. 
</P>
<P>
 In either instance, assuming a playoff payoff approaching $100 million, each 
school would get an annual dividend of, more or less, $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Suppose Dooley and the others have overestimated -- and revenues are only half 
that. What's wrong with half a million? 
</P>
<P>
 Why throw all that away? THREE PLATOONS ANSWER TO OVEREMPHASIS 
</P>
<P>
 Those arguing against a college football playoff typically mention one or more 
of the following: 
</P>
<P>
 * As arranged by the new bowl coalition, there is often a championship game 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, but, were Florida State and Nebraska really No. 1 and No. 2 last week? 
</P>
<P>
 And how much money did they make for Division I? 
</P>
<P>
 When New Year's Day is crowded with eight bowl games -- or even four or five 
-- no one of them realizes the kind of revenue that's there for a later 
championship event. 
</P>
<P>
 To maximize proceeds, the universities need a time when a brief title series 
could get the undivided attention of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 * The bowl associations, fearing a loss of prestige, bitterly oppose football 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, but, such fears seem exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 1 bowl tradition is firmly established. And interest will be even 
greater in the New Year's games that have final-four significance. 
</P>
<P>
 The bowl associations have already profited hugely from their friendly 
relationship with college football. Their self-serving lobbying against a 
four-team playoff -- in an era of great need for the universities -- is 
unseemly. 
</P>
<P>
 * College football in January means that the players will have to miss too 
many classes.  
</P>
<P>
 Yes, but, a campus classroom isn't necessary to the learning process. You can 
go to school in any hotel, in any suburb. 
</P>
<P>
 Where necessary, the teams could travel during the postseason with three 
platoons: offensive, defensive and academic. They make enough money to take 
along a small platoon of tutors to help the players who need it. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an NCAA rule against aid to athletes unless the same services are 
offered to other students, but NCAA rules are often modified. A reason for 
modifying this one is that the revenue created by football players will be of 
benefit to all students. 
</P>
<P>
 The point is moot, of course, at the many schools that are between semesters 
or quarters in January. 
</P>
<P>
 After New Year's Day, moreover, only those who play for the final-four teams 
need be off campus, and some will only be gone for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Although cries of overemphasis can again be expected, the fact is that college 
football players are required, in any case, to miss few classes -- fewer than 
basketball players or debaters or political activists or many others. 
</P>
<P>
 * The university leaders who exploit football players throughout the fall will 
be exploiting them unbearably if they continue it into January. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, but big-time college football should find a way to cut the athletes in. 
They are no longer the amateurs they were earlier in the century. 
</P>
<P>
 As we have argued before in this space, today's college football players are 
entitled to a percentage of the gross -- possibly 20% in the regular season and 
10% during the much more lucrative playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 They earn it. They are recruited as athlete-entertainers whose job is to earn 
it. THEY CAN PICK A FINAL FOUR, NOT A FINAL ONE 
</P>
<P>
 To select a final four each winter, the present voters -- 
sportswriters-broadcasters and coaches -- might as well stay in business. 
</P>
<P>
 Their separate votes for each team could be added up, as they are now by 
coalition calculators. And the top four in the combined totals could be seeded 
1 through 4. 
</P>
<P>
 If there were a playoff this winter, the top-seeded teams, as determined in 
this week's compilation after the bowl games, would be Florida State, Notre 
Dame, Nebraska, and Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Those seem the obvious four. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, over the years, the coaches and writers have usually had the top four 
right -- though not always in the right order. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet if voting by groups of bystanders is good enough to certify a quartet, it 
is an unacceptable way to crown a champion. 
</P>
<P>
 It's like letting historians decide who won the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is that the inherent defects of any poll are magnified when one 
team must be singled out as champion. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, some of the writers raising their hands for Florida State again 
this week -- instead of Notre Dame -- are engaging, no doubt, in a 
self-fulfilling prophecy, having first named the Seminoles No. 1 last summer, 
before their first game. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, that sort of thing isn't what's mainly wrong with polls. If there were 
a final-four playoff, you couldn't be sure the best team won that way, either. 
</P>
<P>
 The crucial flaw in voting for No. 1 is that it creates absolutely nothing in 
the way of revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 What's needed most is a fresh way to raise fresh money.

HART SILENCES ICE-COLD CANYON, 52-26; HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL: COWBOYS SHOOT 
16%, MAKE ONE BASKET IN LAST 20 MINUTES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Canyon High, winner of 10 of its previous 11 games with two big-time scorers 
leading the way, wanted to come into Foothill League rival Hart's gym and make 
some noise Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Noises like swish to make a standing-room-only Hart crowd go hush . 
</P>
<P>
 But the only noise the Cowboys made was the clank of their shots bouncing off 
the rim -- when they reached the rim -- in an ugly 52-26 setback. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart held Canyon to one point in the third quarter and only one field goal in 
the final 20 minutes 50 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Minor, who was averaging more than 23 points a game, finished with nine. 
Charles Woodard, averaging more than 21, managed two. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really didn't know what to expect from them," Hart guard Eric Spindt said. 
"But we had them rattled by the second quarter. You could see it in their 
eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 Hart improved to 17-1, 4-0 in league play; Canyon (13-5, 3-1) shot only 16%. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon scored only one basket after the 4:50 mark of the second quarter -- a 
rebound and put-back by Brian Connelly with 3:18 to play and the Indians 
leading by 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon Coach Greg Hayes afterward told his players to forget about the dismal 
performance -- they'd never have to watch game film. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a throw-away game," he said. "It's done. We don't want to analyze it any 
further than the final score. (Hart) played extremely well -- total domination. 
We came out tight and got tighter." 
</P>
<P>
 Hart led by nine points at the end of the first quarter and 16 at halftime, 
with center Cody Patterson (16 points and eight rebounds) scoring 12 points in 
the half. 
</P>
<P>
 As Canyon's effort in the second half became more futile -- the Cowboys 
trailed by as many as 30 points -- the contest began to resemble a Hart-Canyon 
football game without whistles. Pushing, slapping and elbowing persisted until 
Canyon guard Chad Phillips lost his temper and charged Patterson at mid-court. 
Phillips was assessed a technical foul. 
</P>
<P>
 In another incident, Woodard appeared to take an elbow to the mouth but was 
called for an intentional foul. After Adam Dover missed both free throws, a 
whistle blew and one of the referees was seen yelling angrily at Woodard. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayes was forced to use his last timeout to break the tension, after which 
Canyon was given the ball. No foul was called but Canyon, once again, was 
unable to do anything with the ball.

JESSIE KEEPS VENTURA FROM SHOOTING ITSELF IN THE FOOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Everyone keeps going after the big dog, but somehow the beast escapes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura men's basketball team stretched its winning streak to 21 games 
with a 74-60 victory over Glendale in a Western State Conference interdivision 
game Saturday night despite another poor shooting performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The streak ties the school record, set at the outset of last season. Ventura 
(21-1, 3-0 in conference play), the state's No. 1 team, plays host to Santa 
Monica, which broke last year's streak, on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won another tough one," Coach Philip Mathews said. "Teams are going to 
come after us and (Glendale) did." 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale (9-8, 1-2) played the Pirates as tough as anyone has this season, 
particularly in the first half. The Vaqueros trailed by as many as seven points 
twice in the half (19-12 and 24-17) before scoring five consecutive points to 
tie the score, 34-34, with 30 seconds remaining before intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 A turnaround jumper by forward Brandon Jessie at the buzzer gave Ventura a 
36-34 halftime edge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave them all they wanted," Glendale Coach Brian Beauchemin said. "We came 
out here to compete and we competed. But they are so strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially on the boards, where Jessie thrives. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-5 sophomore had a game-high 19 rebounds to go with his game-high 30 
points. He was particularly effective in the second half, when the Pirates went 
hard on the offensive boards and started to pull away. Jessie was complemented 
by Joey Ramirez, who scored 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale led, 48-47, with 12:49 remaining in the game when Mike Macchia hit a 
three-point shot. But soon after, the Vaqueros hit a dry spell and went 
scoreless for more than five minutes while Ventura raced ahead, 56-50, with 
less than seven minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
 They went cold again after a Ryan Asplund jumper made it 56-52 and Ventura 
went on a 7-0 run for a 63-52 cushion with 1:41 to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Asplund, a 6-2 sophomore guard from La Canada High, provided the punch for 
Glendale, scoring a team-high 18 points before fouling out late in the game. 
Twelve of his points came on three-point baskets. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore forward James Evans scored 10 points for Glendale, all in the first 
half, but sat out most of the second period because of foul trouble. Macchia 
finished with nine points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates shot only 32.3% (22 of 68) from the field but made 26 of 34 free 
throws (76.4%). Glendale was 19 of 56 (33.9%) from the field and 13 of 19 from 
the line (68.1%).

BOYS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; GONZALEZ, HUNTINGTON BEACH HOLD OFF SERVITE TO WIN, 
54-46 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't pretty, but Huntington Beach, led by Tony Gonzalez's 18 points and 
13 rebounds, had enough firepower to hold off Servite for a 54-46 Sunset League 
victory Saturday night at Huntington Beach High. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams were tied at halftime, but Huntington Beach outscored Servite, 12-2, 
over a 6-minute, 9-second span in the second half to open a 44-34 lead. The 
Oilers then made nine of 10 free throws in the final two minutes to ice the 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach (9-6, 3-0 in league) remained in first place with the 
victory. Servite falls to 9-5, 2-1, and had its seven-game winning streak 
broken. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't get it done offensively tonight," Servite Coach Scott Hamilton 
said. "Maybe we were just flat after winning two league games (last) week, I 
don't know. Huntington Beach is a fine team, but we had some opportunities and 
didn't execute." 
</P>
<P>
 Servite shot 30% (13 of 43) from the field, and after David Downs, who had a 
team-high 19 points, scored on a drive to cut Huntington Beach's lead to 35-34 
with 1:56 remaining in the third quarter, the Friars went scoreless for the 
next 5:15. 
</P>
<P>
 During Servite's scoring drought, Gonzalez fed Matt Jones, who had 10 points, 
for a layup to start a 9-0 run. 
</P>
<P>
 Clay Chilcott made a three-pointer and a 12-foot bank shot in the run, pushing 
Huntington Beach's lead to 44-34 with 7:22 remaining.  
</P>
<P>
 Although Servite's defense held Gonzalez, who made 10 of 12 free throws, to 
one second-half shot and 10 points in the final three quarters, the rest of the 
Oilers picked up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, most teams will focus on Tony," Huntington Beach Coach Roy Miller 
said. "But the other kids picked it up tonight and that's what we needed." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones had six points in the third quarter, when the Oilers outscored Servite, 
18-10. Josh Holland had nine points and Matt Malmquist added seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristian Vallas had 15 points for Servite, but 6-foot-9 center Mark Seaton was 
limited to five points, making one of 10 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Sunset League boys' games: 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley 42, Marina 36 -- Daniel Keller had 13 points for Fountain 
Valley (10-4, 2-1). Louis Worthy had 12 points for Marina. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison 74, Westminster 65 -- Micah Kroeger scored 22 points for Edison (8-4, 
1-2). Mark Steele scored 13 points for Westminster (0-3 in league). 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View 55, Santa Ana 46 -- Mike Carney scored 17 points to lead Ocean View 
(8-7, 3-0). Juan Corral had 18 points for Santa Ana (0-3 in league). 
</P>
<P>
 In nonleague boys' basketball: 
</P>
<P>
 Liberty Christian 63, La Verne Lutheran 62 -- Dave Vacarro made two free 
throws with eight seconds left to put Liberty Christian (4-8) ahead by three, 
then blocked a three-pointer in the final seconds. Bob McClung had 27 points, 
including four three-pointers, for the Minutemen. 
</P>
<P>
 Sierra Madre Maranatha 91, Southern California Christian 73 -- Josh Cameron 
scored 38 points to lead SCC (3-9).

GIRLS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; FOUNTAIN VALLEY REGROUPS, DEFEATS NO. 9 MARINA IN 
OVERTIME

 Fountain Valley Coach Carol Strausberg didn't call her team's game Saturday 
against Marina do-or-die, but did admit that after her fifth-ranked Barons were 
upset last week, a second consecutive loss would be almost like having one foot 
in the grave. 
</P>
<P>
 The Barons won in overtime, 44-41, over ninth-ranked Marina (9-5, 2-1 in 
league) in a key Sunset League matchup. 
</P>
<P>
 "With two losses in a row, it would be hard to come back from," Strausberg 
said. "I thought we played with composure to beat them again." 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley (10-4, 2-1) beat the Vikings by two points in the Marina 
tournament en route to the title, but after Marina took a 30-25 lead to open 
the third quarter, it appeared the Vikings were in control. They weren't. Six 
turnovers and an 11-1 run by the Barons followed. Only Norie Nakase's 
three-point basket with 1 minute 15 seconds left and Shandy Robbins' turnaround 
jumper amid three defenders with 19 seconds to go prevented Fountain Valley 
from winning in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 In other Sunset League basketball games: 
</P>
<P>
 Edison 78, Westminster 59 -- Marie Philman scored 36 points and grabbed 16 
rebounds despite first-half foul trouble as No. 8 Edison (10-4, 1-2) rallied 
from a 36-31 halftime deficit. Philman, who is averaging 29 points, sat out the 
second quarter with three fouls after scoring 15 points in the first. 
</P>
<P>
 Amber Farroux scored 18 points for Westminster (5-9, 0-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View 62, Santa Ana 39 -- Farrah Magee scored 14 points and Becky Fraser 
had 12 rebounds to lead No. 6 Ocean View (11-3, 2-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Rosary 50, Huntington Beach 45 -- Jennifer Chey scored 16 points to lead 
Rosary (9-1, 3-0). 
</P>
<P>
 In the Olympic League: 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley Christian 52, Orange Lutheran 44 -- Andie Shaffner had 15 
points and 11 rebounds to lead Capistrano Valley Christian (7-5, 1-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Ontario Christian 60, Whittier Christian 57 -- Kara Systma had 21 points and 
Emily Schoneveld scored 19 for Ontario Christian (9-3, 2-1). Alana Kempton had 
a game-high 27 points for Whittier Christian (6-6, 1-2). 
</P>
<P>
 In nonleague games: 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda 84, El Dorado 37 -- The top-ranked Ladycats (13-0) led, 8-6, 
before a 20-3 run put El Dorado (11-4) on ice. Kiyoko Miller scored 22 points 
and Colleen Hudson had 17. Nicole Erickson had 11, all in the first half. 
Shanna Renken had 17 for El Dorado. MARTIN HENDERSON

DOMINGUEZ IMPRESSIVE IN ROUT OF POMONA; BASKETBALL: THE TOROS OPEN FAST AND 
DON'T LET UP IN 90-63 VICTORY. THEIR 11-3 RECORD TIES THE BEST START IN SCHOOL 
HISTORY.

<P>
 Granted, the Cal State Dominguez Hills men's basketball team has yet to reach 
the toughest part of the California Collegiate Athletic Assn. schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly with a road game against Cal State Bakersfield, the defending 
NCAA Division II champion, coming up on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was hard to find fault in the Toros' 90-63 victory over Cal Poly Pomona 
on Saturday night at Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toros (11-3) got their season high in points while matching the best start 
in school history and improving to 2-0 in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toros, who also started 11-3 in 1980-81 and 1986-87, shot 52.6% from the 
floor, making 26 of 46 shots, including eight of 11 from three-point-range 
(66.7%) -- both season highs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the best two halves we played. This was a game for 40 minutes," said 
Dominguez Hills Coach Dave Yanai. "We really put some possessions together on 
offense and defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Paul had a game-high 24 points for Dominguez Hills, which had 19 steals 
and forced 28 turnovers against Pomona (9-7, 0-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Sal Serrano posted a career-high 20 points, including four three-point 
baskets. Chris Thompson added 16 for the Toros, who beat Cal State San 
Bernardino, 66-57, on Thursday in their conference opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Serrano, a 5-foot-10 senior guard, was six of six from the field and did not 
miss in four attempts from the free-throw line. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been playing in spurts," Serrano said. "This was the first time we 
finally put two halves together and showed what we could do." 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't take the Toros, who led by 30 points in the second half, very long 
to secure their third victory in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez Hills raced to a 12-2 lead in the first four minutes with the help 
of three three-point baskets, including two by Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toros stretched their lead to 35-15 on a three-pointer by Serrano with 6 
minutes, 35 seconds left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Serrano sank his third three-point basket of the half as time expired to give 
Dominguez Hills a 52-29 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toros scored nine of the first 11 points of the second half, including 
five by Thompson during the spurt, to build a 61-31 lead with 16:10 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is blending together, making everything starting to click," Paul 
said. "We're 2-0, but we have a lot higher goals. We're right where we want to 
be going up north (to Bakersfield)."

VOICES: THE FEAR FACTOR; AN ARTIST FINDS THAT HER TEACHING TECHNIQUES HELP 
STUDENTS OVERCOME PREJUDICE, ANXIETY AND SELF-DOUBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA ADAMS, Lisa Adams, 38, lives Downtown near 7th Street and Santa Fe 
Avenue, where a community of artists is growing. She received scholarships to 
Scripps College and Claremont Graduate School, where she earned her master's 
degree in fine arts in 1980. Recently, she was selected by BMW to paint one of 
its cars for an exhibit in Los Angeles. She was interviewed by Monica Gyulai. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 I teach art at many colleges in the Los Angeles area. Artists have a tendency 
to sit in their boxes with their subconscious, but I find that teaching keeps 
me going. I get to meet, interact with and influence a couple hundred students 
each year. Teaching people from different parts of town, ethnic backgrounds and 
economic levels puts me in a premier position to make people aware of what 
being an artist is really like.  
</P>
<P>
 Artists are neither stars nor necessarily crazy and suffering. I hope the 
model of the suffering artist is beginning to fade. Artists can man their own 
ships and run their own businesses. The last thing my students would say about 
me is that I'm victimized. 
</P>
<P>
 Being an artist is like doing any other job, except that artists don't really 
have a choice about what to become. Most people don't really believe that 
artists can't choose, but something in my body and psyche told me at age 10 
that I would be an artist. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope that I am inspirational to students who come from underprivileged 
backgrounds; that I make it clear that they can do something meaningful just as 
well as someone who came from privilege. Growing up poor instills anxieties and 
self-doubts in people. If someone doesn't have a base of income, it is a tough 
haul upward as an artist, but it can be done. 
</P>
<P>
 I spent the first five years of my life in the back of a Ford. My father was 
job hunting, so we moved around the country a lot. He was a tool and die maker 
who worked himself from the abject poverty of growing up as an orphan in 
ghettos to being a lower-level executive in the aircraft industry. His 
transition was important, psychologically, for me. 
</P>
<P>
 My father died when I was 19, but as a child I spent a lot of quality time 
with him, sometimes in airports and machine shops. He had a hard-work ethic and 
was really into education. Every week he took me to the library for 10 new 
books, and I can't emphasize enough the impact that activity had on me. 
</P>
<P>
 I was raised in different parts of this country and my family had very little. 
Having meager means shapes how people think about the world and how they think 
about themselves, even after they are able to rise above it, if they do. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think many people who come from privilege share with poor people the 
same compassion for a difficult life -- they don't come into the world with the 
same set of experiences. I grew up in black neighborhoods and Hispanic 
neighborhoods and find it easy to move in and out of different ethnic areas and 
neighborhoods in Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 The beauty of living in a super-multiethnic area like Los Angeles is that you 
don't have to go to Korea to experience real Korean food or shopping. You can 
shop in Little Tokyo and Chinatown. I have been to Asia and things are very 
authentic here. 
</P>
<P>
 But most people in this city can't flow in and out of different places with 
much ease; they are not willing to make movement a part of their daily routine. 
Instead, they maintain ignorance and build myths about people whom they do not 
really know.  
</P>
<P>
 That kind of segregation is part of what brought on the riots. Many people are 
afraid to go places -- they are afraid to come Downtown. They are afraid of 
what they don't know. Fear is one of the biggest stymies in this city. I had an 
upbringing that keeps me from being frightened of places today. If I felt fear 
in the neighborhoods where I grew up, or when I was living in New York or 
Europe, I would have attracted bad situations. There is a slice of life 
available to me now because I don't fear places. 
</P>
<P>
 With my students, I try to promote the values of going to different areas of 
town; of seeing new things. Some of my students have never even been Downtown, 
so I invite them to my studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone has something to teach, and should teach. Los Angeles is an intense 
place. But because L.A. is such a large multiethnic community, it is important 
to make life work here. If we don't, it will be a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Teaching is an important way of interacting with people that is not combative 
and should not be characterized by defensiveness. Cookie baking or painting, 
everyone has something to teach and there are schools and night classes where 
everyone can participate. Those people who plan to stay here might as well take 
on the responsibility of really making this a good place to live.

VOICES: SOME FACTS . . . FROM A STORYTELLER; ORAL TRADITION IS MORE THAN JUST 
FOLK TALES AND RHYMES; IT PROVIDES PEOPLE WITH AN IMPORTANT CONNECTION TO THEIR 
PAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE PERRY, About 15 years ago, after receiving his master's degree in 
theater arts, and performing and teaching theater at the university and 
community level, Leslie Perry found his life's calling: storytelling. Currently 
a California Arts Council artist in residence, Perry teaches storytelling at 
two elementary schools in Pasadena. He has toured nationally and performed 
locally at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, the Gene Autry Western 
Heritage Museum and the International Festival of Masks. He was interviewed by 
Donna Mungen. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was born in Saginaw, Mich., and there was very little theater. There were 
certain teachers who inspired my acting ability as a young kid. But I didn't 
really find an avenue for acting until my family moved to California in 1956 
looking for greater opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 After I arrived, I enrolled at Pasadena City College, but I found myself 
hunting around to see what the acting scene was like. Finally I got involved 
with a theater group, but I didn't start in storytelling until much later. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1970 I was teaching in the black studies department at UC Berkeley. At that 
time throughout the country, it was popular to do the "anti-whitey" thing, but 
I wasn't into that. I wanted to get into something that related to the family.  
</P>
<P>
 So I got my students into doing folk tales, and we used "The Book of Negro 
Folklore" by Arna Bontempts and Langston Hughes for the class text. In the next 
two semesters we put on several productions. Some wonderful things came out of 
that class and it just stuck in my mind. When I moved back down here in 1975, I 
put it into play form. 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning I did my stories in character and costume, but after meeting 
some other storytellers, such as Mildred Burch of Pasadena, who puts on an 
annual storytelling contest called "By Word of Mouth," I discovered that many 
other storytellers perform in their own clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 There are three kinds of storytellers: those who started out as librarians, 
teachers and theater people. This is not acting or the performance of the 
story. It is telling a story. You can do it in a dramatic way by creating the 
story with facial or physical expressions, but the story is the most important 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
 For me, entertaining the audience is the most significant part in 
storytelling. To inform is part of it, but if you don't hold the audience's 
attention they won't hold on to the information. 
</P>
<P>
 The way to make your story entertaining is to include several gimmicks -- like 
I might throw in a song or include audience participation. For instance, there 
is an old folk tale that I tell about "Wylie and the Hairy Man." The way I tell 
it, there is a lot of repetition, and every time I tell it, the kids start 
repeating the phrase "Gurgle, gurgle! Burble, burble!" over and over. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of my stories have a moral behind them. One of my favorites is "Prize 
Mule." In that story there is a countywide contest for the best mule. Everybody 
expects the beautiful, groomed prize mule to win. But among the contestants is 
a unruly, ungroomed mule owned by a man known for his cheating and lying. 
</P>
<P>
 This man is determined to eliminate the prize mule because he feels it is his 
greatest competition. 
</P>
<P>
 So the night before the contest, the man sneaks into the barn of the prize 
mule and decides to bury him alive. He knocks down the mule, piles the dirt up 
high and leaves with the satisfaction that the mule is dead.  
</P>
<P>
 But the animal is only faking death, and immediately after the man leaves, the 
mule "just shakes off the dirt, stamps the ground and rises on up!" 
</P>
<P>
 The next day the lying and cheating man confidently parades his own mule. 
Immediately the man spots the prize mule among the contestants but thinks it's 
a ghost because he's certain he buried the mule the night before. 
</P>
<P>
 So he screams, runs out of the fairgrounds and has never been seen again. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as I finish the story I tell the kids there is a lesson for everyone 
in how the prize mule reacted: Instead of trying to hit that lying and cheating 
person with a baseball bat, one should "just shake off the dirt, stamp on the 
ground and rise on up!" 
</P>
<P>
 Most people think it is an art form only for children, but it is for the 
entire community. We must take storytelling into places like the Mark Taper 
Forum and not just keep it in libraries, schools and small theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Storytelling is more than just folk tales and rhymes; it provides a connection 
with our past. Oral tradition and the recounting of stories form the collected 
memory of the human race. 
</P>
<P>
 Storytelling captures and saves moments of our culture, and in the process it 
provides a history of all people.  
</P>
<P>
 Jazz eventually moved from the exclusive nightclub scene into places like 
Carnegie Hall and finally brought more respect to the art form. The same needs 
to happen for storytelling.

 The only question facing onlookers of Fremont High's basketball game against 
Jefferson Friday night was: How large would the Pathfinders' margin of victory 
be? Fremont, which led by as many as 42 points, dominated the entire 32 minutes 
of play in winning a 95-58 Southeast Conference game at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are bigger and better than I thought," said Jefferson Coach Andy 
Fujitsubo. 
</P>
<P>
 The disaster began for Jefferson after point guard Anthony Martin, who scored 
13 points on 3-of-13 shooting, sank two free throws to cut Fremont's lead to 
34-21 with 3:35 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 From that point on, the Pathfinders closed out the second quarter with a 
13-point run and opened the third quarter by scoring the first 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
 When Jefferson guard Robert Robinson, who led the Democrats with 18 points, 
scored with 4:20 remaining in the third, his team was down, 57-24. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wore them down," said Fremont coach Sam Sullivan, "We had a definite size 
advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 Fremont guard Calvin Patterson enjoyed game-highs in points, 24, and rebounds, 
eight. "I think our victory was due more to our team's intensity and emotion 
than advantage in size," Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson inability to protect the basketball caused its half-court offense to 
suffer. The fact that Martin had more turnovers (9) than assists (2) typified 
the Democrats frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't match up on the boards but we definitely had problems with 
turnovers," Fujitsubo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fremont received balanced scoring from its starters and bench as four players, 
Leon Jones, Antonio Hines, Jamaal Johnson and Thomas Hildreth, scored eight 
points each. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson forward Haigi Gant, who also scored eight, had seven rebounds, two 
blocks and two steals for the Democrats.

returned. Flemons finished with 18 points to lead the Tarbabes.ROY JURGENS

 Roosevelt 67, Garfield 47 -- Day or night, the Roughriders were too much for 
the Bulldogs in the Southeastern Conference game at Roosevelt.  
</P>

accommodate cable television and attract a larger crowd.But Garfield Coach 
Coleen Ota refused, citing no desire to extend a favor for the Bulldogs' 
longtime arch-rivals.

Garfield to one field goal in the first five minutes of the second quarter to

 Gardena guard Alex Boulden scored seven points to lead the Mohicans to a 
surprising 39-36 victory Friday over Washington as four of the Generals' 
starters -- including Division I prospects Dayron Harris and guard Gregory 
Gales -- did not attend the Southern Pacific Conference opener at Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardena led 37-36 when guard Alex Boulden was fouled with 13 seconds left to 
play.Boulden made two free throws to give the Mohicans a three-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington's Rahman Sparks missed a three-point shot with four seconds left 
that would have sent the game into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 General forward Antonio Lewis led all scorers with 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Lamar and Patrick Blake were the other players not to suit up for 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, who was reached by phone, said the four did not play because of 
academic obligations. "It was not about discipline," he said. "We had something 
important to do. We had to fill out papers for college because it's getting 
close to the (enrollment) deadline. The Gardena game was not important. We 
thought we would win anyway. We were at the game later on." 
</P>
<P>
 "They had something else to do," said Washington Co-Coach Dave Johnson. 
"College paperwork was one thing. I don't want to talk about it." Johnson he 
would not say if the players would return for Wednesday's game at San 
Pedro.GARY CHAVEZ

 Manual Arts 69, Venice 48 -- There are several outstanding guards in the 
Coastal Conference, but very few inside players who can match the talents of 
Manual Arts David Rickenbacker. 
</P>
<P>
 Rickenbacker, a 6-foot-5 forward who signed with San Diego State, scored 31 
points as the Toilers won their Coastal Conference opener Friday in only their 
second game at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toilers used a two-three trapping zone defense and held Venice to only two 
points in the first quarter. Then Rickenbacker took control inside, scoring 16 
of his team's 18 points in the second quarter as the Toilers took a 29-14 
halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gondoliers played a zone defense throughout the game, but that did not 
stop Rickenbacker from scoring inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Venice guard Rasheed Hazzard, the son of former UCLA and NBA star Walt 
Hazzard, had 18 points to lead Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toilers played without starting forward John Thompson, who is recovering 
from a sprained right ankle.SEAN WATERS

WHERE THE REAL ESTATE MARKET'S HIGHS AND LOWS HAVE HIT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bert and Lynda Duzy always dreamed of owning their own home. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, thanks to the depressed real estate market, they do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, there were high interest rates and high prices," said Bert Duzy, 38, 
sitting in the living room of the Simi Valley home the couple purchased for 
$157,000 in August. "But I watched the classifieds, the business news, the real 
estate sections, you know. And then everything else fell together and the 
interest rates fell down to 6%." 
</P>
<P>
 The recession has been good to Bert, who owns a land-maintenance company, 
homemaker Lynda, 30, and their two daughters. As they settle into their 
1,500-square-foot house on half an acre, they can't help but be grateful to the 
housing market that made it all possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the county, however, Helen (Mickey) Westbrook, 66, and Lu Pasqua, 64, 
are silently cursing the same market. 
</P>
<P>
 Westbrook bought the Ventura Keys home they share five years ago for $500,000. 
The couple thought the 3,000-square-foot home would be ideal for her seven 
grandchildren and his four grandchildren to visit. 
</P>
<P>
 But the grandchildren didn't stay over that often, and the place seemed too 
big for two people. So they put the house on the market in January for 
$850,000, intending to look for a condominium in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been marked down to $700,000, and nearly a year has passed and it still 
hasn't sold. Pasqua, a real estate agent, ticks off a list of neighbors forced 
to unload similar houses for about $400,000, and shakes his head with worry. 
</P>
<P>
 "This house, three or four years ago, would have gone for close to $1 
million," said a rueful Pasqua, enjoying a sunset on the house's picturesque 
patio above a canal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Used to be, no matter what price you put on it, they just kept comparing it 
to L.A. and saying, 'This is a steal,' " he said. "So everybody just raised the 
price, raised the price, and everything was just selling, selling, selling." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the recession set in, he said, "and everything came to a standstill." 
</P>
<P>
 The Duzys and Westbrook and Pasqua are typical buyers and sellers in the 
current real estate market in Ventura County, where large homes languish and 
cheaper houses are snatched up by bargain-hungry first-time buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers and real estate agents looking for signs of hope take comfort that 
sales of single-family houses in Ventura County are projected to have risen 
2.3% in 1993, according to a report prepared by TRW-REDI Property Data, a 
national real estate information firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Among houses priced between $100,000 and $175,000, the increase in sales is 
dramatic: 18%. 
</P>
<P>
 But when cheaper homes sell faster than more expensive ones, the average price 
drops. Thus, from 1992 to 1993, county house prices are projected to have 
dropped 1.4%, the report states. 
</P>
<P>
 While lower-priced homes are selling better than in 1992, the middle of the 
market is slower and the high end only marginally improved. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Schniepp, director of the UC Santa Barbara Economic Forecasting Project, 
said most of the market activity is coming from renters who can now afford to 
buy houses and discontented suburbanites fleeing Los Angeles for safer, less 
congested pastures. Missing, he said, is "internal activity" in the Ventura 
County market, with local homeowners selling houses and buying up to larger, 
pricier homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Real estate sales should nearly be at an all-time high because of the low 
interest rates," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schniepp predicts that the real estate sales will continue to sputter along 
for at least another year, perhaps not falling as low as they have been in the 
recent past but not improving markedly. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, residential and commercial foreclosures in the county -- which tend to 
drag down home prices -- are projected to have reached about 1,600 in 1993, a 
53% increase over 1992 and a 13-year high, according to TRW-REDI figures. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 House prices have declined precipitously since the recession began in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The average price in Oxnard, for example, at the peak of the most recent real 
estate boom in February, 1990, was $271,620, according to figures compiled by 
the UCSB forecasting project. By June, 1993, according to the UCSB group, the 
average price was $178,173 -- a 34% drop. 
</P>
<P>
 The local market, however, is at least improving, while sales elsewhere in the 
state and region are declining. 
</P>
<P>
 Home sales in California are projected to have dropped 2.5% in 1993 compared 
to 1992, while the decline is expected to be 4.4% in Los Angeles County and 
8.9% in San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
 Many real estate agents are optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is beginning to change," said Gayle Caughey of Jon Douglas Realtors in 
Westlake. "Early (in 1993), March and April, is when the market started to 
turn." 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Cusick, a real estate agent with Century 21 County Center Realty in 
Ventura, also senses renewed energy in the local market. "I feel Ventura County 
has fantastic potential," Cusick said. "I think we're going to be looking at a 
much healthier market in 1994." He and his colleagues clearly hope so. The last 
few years have been devastating for real estate agents as well. 
</P>
<P>
 A year and a half ago, there were 1,600 agents in the Moorpark-Simi Valley 
Assn. of Realtors, said Dan Dudek, the group's president. Today, there are 
about 1,050. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen a number of realtors' homes that come up on the default list," he 
said. "I've heard a lot of people comment, 'Dear Lord, give me one good market, 
and I promise not to throw it all away this time.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Shari LeKander, an agent with Bob Ely Realty in Westlake, said that even when 
she has eager buyers on the high or low ends of the market, there isn't much 
good stuff to show them. Builders aren't building and many prospective sellers 
are holding onto their homes as long as possible, hoping prices will pick up 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many ho-hum products on the market," she said. "It's like 
pouncing on a June bug when a sharp one comes along." 
</P>
<P>
 If any house looks like the proverbial June bug, it would be Donna Cottam's 
three-bedroom, two-bath Camarillo home, marked down to $229,950 from $237,900, 
its living room newly redecorated in a cheery floral pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cottam, 46, and her husband, Richard, 52, put the house on the market in early 
September. So far, the only visitors have been "looky-loos" and picky buyers 
who make time-wasting, low-ball offers while they continue to search for the 
perfect deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't heard a bad comment about the house," Cottam said, "but it's a 
buyers' market and they seem to offer whatever seems reasonable to them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cottams had no plans to sell their house as recently as a year ago. Then 
the Canoga Park plant where Richard worked as a supervisor closed, and he was 
transferred to Tucson, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Richard started his new job in Tucson in the summer, Donna, an 
accountant in Newbury Park, put the Camarillo house on the market -- and 
waited. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought there would be more people coming through," Donna said with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
 LeKander, the Westlake real estate agent, knows only too well the kind of 
buyers traipsing through the Cottam house. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if anything, buyers are becoming a bit spoiled," she said. "Because 
they hear constantly that prices are down, they've upped their expectations of 
what they are going to get." 
</P>
<P>
 Most realtors long for clients like the Duzys. Sick of their former San 
Fernando Valley neighborhood, eager to buy and totally unencumbered by any need 
to sell their previous house, they started looking for a home in April, put an 
offer on a house in May and closed escrow by the end of August. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, as Linda listed the cornucopia of fruit trees growing in their 
expansive back yard ("five pomegranate trees, peaches, apricots, grapefruit, 
figs, persimmons"), Bert shakes his head in wonder at the great deal they 
landed. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this price, I would've expected it to be some shack," he said. "We didn't 
want to move to Palmdale, you know what I mean?"

A RANGER IN PARADISE; SANTA BARBARA ISLAND: BETH FULSOM WORKS AND LIVES ALONE 
IN THE EXOTIC SETTING. 'I'M HERE BY CHOICE,' SHE SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES HILLINGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beth Fulsom is the only human being on tiny, exotic Santa Barbara Island, 47 
miles out to sea from Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 But she isn't alone. 
</P>
<P>
 She shares the one-square-mile, wind-swept, treeless island with 160,000 
beady-eyed deer mice, thousands of sea gulls, pelicans and other sea birds and 
more than 1,000 sea lions. 
</P>
<P>
 Fulsom, 33, has one of the most remote outposts of any ranger in the National 
Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here by choice," the 12-year Park Service veteran said. "I love the 
island. Santa Barbara is the crown jewel of the five islands that make up the 
Channel Islands National Park." 
</P>
<P>
 Fulsom, whose tour of duty on the island will last two years, has been the 
sole ranger there since April 10. There are also rangers stationed at the four 
other islands -- Anacapa, Santa Cruz, Santa Rosa and San Miguel. 
</P>
<P>
 She is on the island 10 days and off five. During the summer, seasonal rangers 
fill in for her. In winter, the ranger station is not staffed when she is off 
the island. 
</P>
<P>
 During the winter, few mariners risk sailing out to the island because of the 
fierce storms and treacherous seas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sea gets so rough," Fulsom said. "Sometimes it breaks over the second 
pier of the dock, 25 feet out of water. There is no place for a boat to hide, 
no safe anchorage for boats to go to during winter storms." 
</P>
<P>
 When the waters are calm, Fulsom makes the three-hour sea journey to Santa 
Barbara Island from Ventura aboard a National Park Service boat. When seas are 
too rough, she is flown to and from the island by helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara Island is a world apart from eastern Pennsylvania, where Fulsom 
grew up. She graduated in 1982 from East Stroudsburg State College in the 
Poconos, where she majored in parks and recreation. Since graduating, she has 
been a ranger in five National Parks in Delaware, New York, Pennsylvania and 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Her newest assignment agrees with her.  
</P>
<P>
 "One of my main reasons why I requested to be assigned to Santa Barbara Island 
is because of the outstanding diving here," Fulsom said. "Fish everywhere. 
Lobster. Diving with whales passing through and hanging around the island for a 
few days and with sea lions that swim up to your mask." 
</P>
<P>
 "Often I will put a line in the water and fish for dinner -- sheepshead, 
opaleye, perch or calico bass, my favorite," she said. "If I'm in the mood for 
lobster, I dive for one. Pretty good life, huh?"  
</P>
<P>
 Fulsom lives in a yellow stucco structure looming over the sea at Landing 
Cove. The building houses the ranger's four-room residence, a visitors center 
and a small museum. 
</P>
<P>
 She begins her workday by raising the flag and opening the visitor's center. 
Then she radios park headquarters in Ventura about weather and sea conditions, 
the number of boats in the anchorage, any citations issued and any unusual 
wildlife activity, "like pods of whales swimming by," Fulsom said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fulsom wears many hats. She is a park ranger, a Santa Barbara County deputy 
sheriff, a California Fish and Game warden and an emergency medical technician 
who treats visitors who have minor injuries. If there is a serious accident, 
she radios for help. 
</P>
<P>
 Because she is a law enforcement officer, she carries a .357 magnum. "I've 
never had to use it, but being alone in this out-of-the-way place, you never 
know what you might encounter," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She patrols the water in a 60-horsepower inflatable boat. It takes her 20 
minutes to circle the island.  
</P>
<P>
 The fewer than 3,500 visitors to the island each year are commercial fishermen 
who harvest lobsters, swordfish and sea urchins; pleasure boaters who anchor 
all along the east coast beneath the island's steep cliffs; and tourists who 
arrive aboard Island Packers concessionaire boats out of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Permits are issued by the Park Service for the eight island campsites, for a 
maximum of 30 campers at any given time. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors have to bring their own water and food, along with tents if they are 
staying overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The ranger leads nature walks along the 5 1/2 miles of trails that crisscross 
the saddle-shaped island, which rises 635 feet out of the water at Signal Peak, 
its high point, and 562 feet at North Peak. 
</P>
<P>
 The island is covered with low-lying vegetation such as Australian saltbush, 
ice plant, prickly pear cactus, cholla and the giant coreopsis that resembles a 
dwarf tree, its thick woody stem growing as high as five feet. In spring, the 
hills of the island are ablaze with golden flowers blossoming on the coreopsis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes groups come out in good weather from schools up and down the coast 
from Santa Barbara to San Diego," Fulsom said. "I lead them and all visitors on 
guided tours to sea lion rookeries, to view the spectacular sea elephants. I 
describe the flora and fauna, island history. We visit kitchen middens where 
prehistoric Indians camped." Kitchen middens are centuries-old Native American 
refuse dumps piled high with abalone and mussel shells. 
</P>
<P>
 Sea lions breed in December and pup in spring. Also in the spring, island 
cliffs are alive with thousands of small, chubby, neckless Xantus murrelets, 
sea birds who instinctively tumble into the sea 48 hours after birth to meet 
their parents and swim away. Santa Barbara Island is the largest known breeding 
colony of Xantus murrelets in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The 160,000 endemic Santa Barbara Island deer mice add to the rough-and-tumble 
atmosphere. Before the new ranger station was completed two years ago, the lone 
island ranger slept in a World War II Quonset hut. Deer mice often walked over 
the ranger's face and body during the night. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the new ranger house is mouse-proof, although the mice frequently chew 
through campers' tents in search of food. "One camper awakened to find three 
baby deer mice born during the night in one of his shoes," said Fulsom. 
</P>
<P>
 The animal life keeps things interesting, Fulsom said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's never a dull moment," she said. "Mice sleep all day, and at night 
they crawl up and down the screens of my house chasing moths attracted by the 
lights. Sea lions at the bottom of the cliff outside my window bark all night 
long, but I'm used to it. The wind howls most of the time. The automated Coast 
Guard light passes over every 11 seconds. Barn owls let loose with raspy 
grackle calls. Yet I sleep like a log." 
</P>
<P>
 For exercise, she daily either runs 10 laps up and down the 300 steep steps 
leading from the landing to the top of the cliff or jogs four miles around the 
perimeter of the island. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never get lonely when I'm alone on the island," said Fulsom, who has 
electricity provided by solar panels mounted on the battery building next to 
the ranger station. "I have a television set but rarely turn it on. I'm a 
voracious reader with two or three novels going at the same time, and I love 
working crossword puzzles." 
</P>
<P>
 When Fulsom is on the mainland, she lives in Ojai and "moonlights" operating a 
boat for the Ventura Harbor Patrol. "I'm a working fool," she laughs.  
</P>
<P>
 At night on the island she sees the myriad of lights twinkling on the 
mainland. Palos Verdes Peninsula is the nearest landfall, 37 miles away. She 
also sees the lights on Catalina Island, 24 miles away.  
</P>
<P>
 In the morning, Fulsom turns on her radio to hear the news and "to listen to 
the Sig Alerts as millions of people head off for work a few miles away in Los 
Angeles County, and here I am all alone, no cars, no roads, a world apart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep pinching myself to make sure this is really happening to me."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS; GOV. WILSON HONORS AIR QUALITY PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sponsors of a fund to improve air quality in Ventura County have been honored 
by Gov. Pete Wilson's office, which lauded the fund as an innovative 
partnership between business and environmental concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund, which officials believe is the only one of its kind in the state, 
provides cash for projects that range from buying buses that run on natural 
compressed gas to providing environmental lessons and videos for high school 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Honored for their part in creating the fund were Richard Baldwin of the 
county's Air Pollution Control District; Kevin Rubey of the 3M Co. in 
Camarillo; Robert Paulger of Procter & Gamble in Oxnard; and Kate McLean of the 
Ventura County Community Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3M Co. donated $1.5 million in July, 1991, to create the fund, which is 
administered by the Ventura County Community Foundation. The money came from 
proceeds 3M collected when it sold air-pollution credits to Procter & Gamble. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale allowed the Oxnard paper-goods manufacturer to double its plant and 
hire 220 new workers. And the sale of the emissions credits resulted in a net 
decrease in air pollution, said Baldwin, the county's air-pollution officer. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement by Wilson issued Friday for the presentation of the award at 
the Los Angeles Museum of Science and Industry, he lauded the initiative for 
"cultivating both jobs and environmental protection." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County fund was one of 12 winners chosen for environmental awards 
out of 70 projects nominated statewide, officials said. KAY SAILLANT

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS; WORKSHOP TO LOOK AT BURNING ALTERNATIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Growers who periodically burn their agriculture wastes can learn about a 
county proposal to change hours and increase the number of permissible burn 
days at a workshop scheduled Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Air Pollution Control District will also offer growers a 
presentation on alternatives to burning, including chipping wastes for mulch or 
shipping them to a waste-to-energy plant in Tulare County. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies that do chipping charge $250 to $350 an hour for use of their 
machinery. But chopping up torn-out trees and branches can still prove 
economical, said Stan Cowen, a rule development engineer at the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not as cheap as burning," he said. "But it's not that expensive either." 
Chipping for mulch yields a product that farmers can use. And if they ship to 
the Tulare plant, they will be paid for their wastes. 
</P>
<P>
 The workshop, at which engineers will accept comments as well as explain the 
proposal, is set for 2 p.m. at the Ventura County Government Center in Ventura. 
The session will be held in the lower plaza assembly room. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed revision would change the hours of permissive burn days from 6 
a.m. to noon to 12 to 4 p.m. That would allow the smoke to disperse more easily 
because of a more prevalent afternoon breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 The air pollution district calls a permissive burn day when its meteorologists 
determine there is no inversion layer to trap smoke and that the winds are 
neither too strong nor too light. 
</P>
<P>
 Because such conditions exist more frequently in the afternoons than mornings, 
the air pollution district will be able to call burn days more often. That 
should reduce the amount of smoke produced on any given day, Cowen said. JOANNA

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS; GRANT AWARDED FOR OIL RECYCLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES MAIELLA JR. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Moorpark has been awarded an $8,462 state grant that will allow it 
to establish an oil and oil filter recycling program in the city, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In partnership with Easy Oil, located in the Park Lane Auto Center, the city 
next month will begin accepting used filters and up to 20 gallons of used oil 
per person per day, said Jill Rubin Myers, the city's solid waste coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an overall benefit because people can save time and gas by going to a 
local facility rather than having to drive out of the city," Myers said. 
"Currently there's no place in Moorpark that accepts oil from walk-in clients." 
</P>
<P>
 The grant was awarded by the California Integrated Waste Management Board and 
will be used to purchase oil and filter storage equipment and to publicize the 
program, Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who recycle their oil by dropping it off at Easy Oil will be given a 
cash incentive of 4 cents per quart, Myers said. The city is also looking to 
expand the program by joining forces with other automotive businesses 
interested in becoming certified as oil drop-off centers, she said. JAMES

<P>
 A man pulled a gun on an Oxnard video-store clerk Saturday, forcing her to 
empty the cash register and her own purse before he fled on foot, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man entered Video Adventures on West Patterson Road about 3 p.m. and asked 
clerk Hea Han for help with a video rental, according to Oxnard police.When Han 
requested the man's rental card, he instead produced a handgun and demanded the 
money from the cash drawer, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Han complied, police said the man then searched for more money in the 
store's office. Finding none, he forced Han to empty her purse, and he emptied 
her wallet. 
</P>
<P>
 The man escaped with $170 before police arrived at the store. MATTHEW MOSK

MAN SLAIN BY GIRLFRIEND'S TEEN-AGE SON, POLICE SAY; OXNARD: ACCORDING TO 
AUTHORITIES, KILLING OCCURRED AFTER ARGUMENT BETWEEN ADULTS ESCALATED TO 
VIOLENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A 15-year-old Oxnard boy bludgeoned his mother's boyfriend to death with a 
wooden stick early Saturday morning as the woman and her boyfriend were 
arguing, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Vargas Ponce, 29, was pronounced dead at the scene from multiple blunt 
injuries to the head and upper body, Oxnard police said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the slaying, the youth was taken to the police station and later 
released to the custody of his mother, authorities said. They said the case 
will be submitted to the Ventura County district attorney's office for review 
after an investigation is complete. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, the 41-year-old Oxnard woman and Ponce had a history of 
domestic violence. Shortly before 3 a.m. Saturday, Ponce arrived at the woman's 
apartment and an argument between the two quickly escalated into physical 
violence, authorities said.  
</P>
<P>
 The woman's teen-age son came to his mother's aid, striking Ponce repeatedly 
with a wooden stick and knocking him to the apartment's front doorstep, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 They said officers and paramedics arrived on the scene soon afterward, but 
Ponce could not be revived.  
</P>
<P>
 The woman and her son live in a rear apartment on a tree-lined residential 
street. Residents said Saturday they were surprised by the homicide, as it 
seemed so out of character for the boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was really shy," said Myeisha Erwing, 16, a next-door neighbor. "He didn't 
bother anybody. He stayed by himself and wasn't into gangs or anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Other neighbors described the boy as having stuck close to his mother. They 
said he did not seem to hang out with other youths.  
</P>
<P>
 Myeisha said the woman and Ponce often fought. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why her son got mad," Myeisha said. "He was just always watching this. 
I guess he just got mad." 
</P>
<P>
 In a similar incident on Christmas Day, 21-year-old Isaias Guerrero was 
stabbed to death, allegedly by his mother's ex-boyfriend, in the front yard of 
Guerrero's Oxnard home. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerrero had tried to reason with Jose Socorro Jimenez, 32, after Jimenez 
showed up at the house at 3 a.m., yelling at Guerrero's mother, police said. A 
fight soon erupted, and Jimenez stabbed Guerrero in the chest with a knife, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimenez has been charged with murder and is being held on $250,000 bail.

ELECTIONS / THOUSAND OAKS CITY COUNCIL; CONTENDERS TAKE ANTI-BICKERING STAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like politicians across the state, the candidates eyeing Thousand Oaks City 
Council seats are busy crafting snappy sound bites on the need for more jobs 
and less crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But when campaign season opens in earnest this summer, they vow to focus on 
another issue they view as equally critical: the need for more decorum in 
council chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 In early comments, a half-dozen candidates are rushing to describe themselves 
as peacemakers, able to quash the mudslinging and squabbling that has come to 
characterize the current City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 City surveys show that nearly half of Thousand Oaks' adult residents tune in 
to televised council meetings from time to time. And some candidates are 
betting that voters will elect political novices rather than sit through 
another four years of infighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "There could be very much an undercurrent of 'Throw the bums out,' " said 
Gregory Cole, a dentist and former city planning commissioner who has announced 
plans to run in November's election. "The conduct of the council recently has 
been pitiful, and the community is fed up with the rancor, the personal attacks 
and the grandstanding." 
</P>
<P>
 The lure of three open seats -- including one without an incumbent -- has 
prompted at least seven challengers to declare that they are seriously 
considering entering the race, even though the election is 10 months away. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Cole, a trustee of the Ventura County Community College District, 
potential candidates include two planning commissioners, businessman Mervyn 
Kopp and photographer Forrest Frields. Also mulling runs are Los Angeles 
firefighter Andy Fox, Compton homicide detective Mike Markey, former City 
Councilman Lee Laxdal and public relations consultant Otto Stoll. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents Judy Lazar and Elois Zeanah have announced their intention to seek 
reelection. Both will probably become targets of sharp criticism, as several 
candidates said they are entering the race in part because they are tired of 
watching Lazar, Zeanah and their colleagues use debates as a forum for personal 
attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The council is not a boxing ring," said Markey, who won 26% of the vote in 
his unsuccessful bid for a council seat four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Kopp, the general manager of Southwind Financial Services, a local mortgage 
company, echoed his rival's concern. "You can't have any kind of decision 
making or discussion in an aura of hostility," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This anti-bickering platform seems likely to gain prominence in 1994, 
political analysts said, in part because the candidates will have few other 
issues to gnaw on. 
</P>
<P>
 "This time, I think, it's going to come down to personalities, and the 
unifying candidate will be the victor," said Steve Rubenstein, president of the 
Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Although every would-be council member plans to discuss crime, Thousand Oaks 
remains one of the nation's safest mid-size cities. Talk of creating jobs may 
provide some fodder, but most candidates agree on the basic principle of 
building stronger ties between government and business. 
</P>
<P>
 With the city near its maximum size, many significant land parcels are already 
in development or have approved blueprints. By November's election, the council 
will have drafted an updated General Plan, mapping out goals and development 
standards for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even the Civic Arts Plaza, long a subject of controversy among politicians and 
voters, may not spark much debate on the campaign trail. Most candidates agree 
that the city must not subsidize the auditorium's operation with taxpayer 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to distinguish themselves, the candidates are emphasizing their 
experience in building coalitions, running fractious organizations and reaching 
out to varied constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Markey cites his work as a homicide detective to prove that he can listen and 
keep an open mind. Stoll mentions his two decades in public relations and his 
role in founding Citizens for a Safe Ventura County. Kopp recounts his efforts 
to end divisiveness in the allocations department of United Way of Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 And Cole trots out a tried-and-true cliche: "It's time," he says, "for a new 
generation of leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Lazar and Zeanah have also promised to tone down the rancor, some of 
their rivals feel the council members have lost credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "The No. 1 most important issue for the council is gaining back the confidence 
of the community and instilling some sense of unity," said Fox, the firefighter 
and former planning commissioner. "Because of the personal attacks and private 
agendas, attention to big issues has suffered." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet veteran politican Alex Fiore, who will retire this fall after 30 years on 
the council, said the emphasis on City Hall harmony could obscure a far more 
important issue. 
</P>
<P>
 From the sidelines, Fiore plans to cast the 1994 elections as a referendum on 
the city's management team -- not the politicians, but the people they hire. A 
big fan of City Manager Grant Brimhall and his cast of department heads, Fiore 
said he fears for their job security if the council makeup shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Mainly, Fiore worries that his longtime foe Zeanah may win reelection and 
sweep one of her allies into office as well, forming a three-member majority 
with Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski to control city politics. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, he said, "Our key management staff would be in grave danger, 
even though our city manager is unparalleled in the state." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the mayor insisted that she did not blame Brimhall or the other department 
heads for the difficulties. If her bloc gained control of the council, Zeanah 
said, she would anticipate full compliance from staff without any personnel 
shake-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 To some of Zeanah's supporters, however, the November election would present a 
perfect opportunity to clean house. 
</P>
<P>
 "Grant Brimhall and (City Atty.) Mark Sellers are whistling in the dark," said 
Michelle Koetke, a leader of Residents to Preserve Newbury Park. "I don't see 
that any of (the top staff) has listened to the people. They seem to be in the 
hip pocket of big business and development." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, only one candidate that Zeanah backs has emerged -- public relations 
consultant Stoll. The others she dismissed as "retreads." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time for people to be elected who do not belong to the good old boys 
club," Zeanah said. "I don't think you'll see a divided council after November, 
1994." 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime political observer and former Councilman Chuck Cohen, however, said 
he did not foresee a quick end to the divisiveness. Zeanah and Fiore represent 
two fundamentally different philosophies, he said, and as long as each camp 
holds some power, the sniping will continue. 
</P>
<P>
 "One group is suspicious of anything and everything," Cohen said. "The other 
recognizes that business in this community has always been openly and honestly 
conducted and there's no reason to be paranoid. The council is split on 
philosophy. And I don't know if (harmony) is going to be possible."

ARTIST REWARDED FOR PRESIDENTIAL AMBITION; ART: UNSOLICITED WORK OF CLINTON WAS 
ACCEPTED BY THE WHITE HOUSE AND WILL HANG IN THE HEADQUARTERS OF A FEDERAL 
AGENCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To some viewers, Jane Heyman's portrait of Bill Clinton might seem to be a 
satirical jab at the President for his peripatetic positions on such issues as 
taxes and gays in the military. 
</P>
<P>
 The contemporary painting, made from a photograph of Clinton taken during the 
$200 Cristophe haircut fiasco, is titled "The Three Faces of Clinton." 
</P>
<P>
 But the work is intended as a tribute; Heyman, a Culver City resident, is a 
huge fan of the President. So shortly after completing the portrait last March, 
she offered the 24-by-48-inch work -- unsolicited -- to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 And the White House accepted. The piece now hangs in the lobby of the 
Corporation for National and Community Service headquarters in Washington, an 
agency created in October to promote social service projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the new (Clinton) Administration," says the classically trained 
painter, represented by Gallery Rodeo International in Beverly Hills. "I used 
three images because I think Clinton is working three times harder than any 
other President to make things happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The message got through to Rick Allen, an assistant deputy to the President, 
who wrote her after receiving her offer: "The picture is outstanding. . . . We 
knew the President watched over us; now he does in triplicate! Thanks so much. 
Letter from the boss to follow." 
</P>
<P>
 Heyman plans to attend an official unveiling of the portrait in Washington. No 
date has been set, but Allen says the President, who has not yet seen the 
painting, will probably be in attendance. Understandably, Heyman's a tad giddy 
about the prospect. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I don't know what I'll wear," she said. "Probably a Madonna outfit. Sexy 
or conservative? It'll depend on how I feel that day." 
</P>
<P>
 A native of New York and a '40s baby boomer, Heyman painted war victims and 
street people during her training at the Pratt Institute in Brooklyn some 20 
years ago. She says she was strongly influenced by the abstract impressionist 
works of Henri Matisse and Francis Bacon. 
</P>
<P>
 She became an established artist in New York but moved to Los Angeles in 1984, 
where she took a job as a legal secretary for a year until she could become a 
recognized painter here. It was during her breaks as a secretary that she began 
creating laser images with a copy machine, later turning them into paintings. 
Los Angeles' ubiquitous celebrity adulation quickly became the subject of her 
multimedia, technology-driven work. 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. is a place where people worship cars, celebrities and things," says 
Heyman, whose celeb clients include James Woods, Ally Sheedy, Ben Stein and Jay 
Bernstein. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone in L.A. is an actor or something. I have friends in L.A. who look 
more like an artist than I do, and all they do is spend the day getting 
dressed. So I stopped painting Fauvist paintings and began painting 
celebrities, their dogs and their families. A good artist is a reflector of 
society." 
</P>
<P>
 Heyman, who sells her paintings for $800 to $5,000 and is showing them at 
Nathanson's Photography in Santa Monica, works out of a studio off Olympic 
Boulevard in West Los Angeles. There, the walls are adorned with serial 
paintings of John F. Kennedy (in progress), Madonna and Oliver North. 
</P>
<P>
 In the painting of North, she used a media photograph of him being sworn in 
during the Iran-Contra hearings, making his facial expression metamorphose 
through nine frames, from deadpan in the first, to faded, fearful -- almost 
cadaverous -- in the last. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing off religious associations and pop idolatry in another work, Heyman 
used a Renaissance painting of the Madonna and child, inserting a photograph of 
pop-diva Madonna into the lap of the Virgin Mary where the infant Jesus 
traditionally sits. 
</P>
<P>
 You might say Heyman's Los Angeles art career started in earnest during a 
sweaty encounter with the pop star in 1984, a meeting that resulted in the sale 
of her first painting to Freddy De Mann, Madonna's manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "I met her in the sauna at the Ritz-Carlton in Laguna in 1984 and I said: 'I 
have a painting of you,' and she said: 'Bring it to my manager's office,' " 
Heyman recounts. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I took it there and left it there. It was a painting of an angelic 
Madonna, like something you would see in the Getty Museum. That was before she 
tried to sexually liberate the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such success, celebrities dominate Heyman's work and life less and 
less these days, she says. Her work, she says, now reflects society's shift 
from "the '80s Me Generation to the '90s family values." 
</P>
<P>
 "What's happening in my work now is people being connected to others, whether 
it's through dogs, love or a baby," she says. "It started when my sister's baby 
was born with a heart defect and we didn't know if he was going to live. I 
painted him after the operation was successful to match the colors of my 
sister's yuppie New York room." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Clinton portrait is also a product of Heyman's new focus on 
changing times. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspiration, she said, came last March at the Beverly Hills Country Club 
during a private show of her work. Heyman was gushing Clinton's praises to a 
patron, who suggested she express her effusions in art. So moved was Heyman, 
she says, that she dashed home to paint the President, using a news photograph 
taken of him after he had received his infamous haircut on Air Force One. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not very political," says Heyman, explaining that she chose the 
photograph for Clinton's commanding, "21-gun salute" expression. 
</P>
<P>
 "During the Vietnam era, all I did was stay in my room and listen to the 
Beatles. I was never big on getting beat up. But Clinton gave me that sense of 
hope that Kennedy gave me. 'The Three Faces of Bill' can be taken (as 
commentary on his ever-changing positions on issues), but I'd like to plead the 
Fifth (Amendment) on that and leave it up to the viewer." 
</P>
<P>
 The work, made in a Warholesque process of laser and painting, is a bit 
untraditional to be the official White House portrait. But presidential aide 
Allen, who lived in Pacific Palisades and is familiar with Heyman's work, said 
it's apropos for the Corporation for National and Community Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen said the agency has outgrown the building it is sharing temporarily with 
three other federal agencies and will be relocating soon -- the portrait in 
tow. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the reasons we wanted (the painting) is because we're a new outfit 
with a very young staff, and although the organization is for Americans in all 
seasons of life, it is mostly for college-age people. We wanted something that 
was hipper than the stuff you see of the President in post offices and other 
federal buildings."

PROSECUTOR'S PERSISTENCE PAYS OFF IN CONVICTION; CRIMINAL JUSTICE: INFORMATION 
FROM A KILLING IN L.A. REVIVED INTEREST IN THE SUSPECT, WHO WAS INITIALLY 
RELEASED FOR LACK OF EVIDENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 More than a year after his office had decided there was not enough evidence to 
file charges in a Monterey Park triple slaying, a persistent deputy district 
attorney managed to prosecute anyway -- and obtained a conviction and death 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a relief," said the prosecutor, Terrence Terauchi, after a Superior 
Court judge in Compton sentenced Eric Lamont Hinton to death Dec. 10 in the 
drug-related killings. 
</P>
<P>
 After Hinton's initial arrest in the case, he was released due to lack of 
evidence: no weapon and a witness who couldn't identify him as the shooter. But 
more than a year later, Terauchi noticed similarities between another case he 
was preparing and the triple slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Hinton, 24, of Lynwood, was convicted early last year of 
first-degree murder with special circumstances in the May 24, 1988, shooting 
deaths of Tenoa L. Stevenson, 26, of Altadena, Albert Brown, Jr., 24, of 
Pasadena, and Landis Barnes, 20, of Lynwood, a Navy officer who was on leave 
from the Long Beach naval base. 
</P>
<P>
 The three men were killed during what police said was a drug deal at the Best 
Western Monterey Park Inn that Hinton had set up in order to rob them. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Cunningham of Pasadena escaped by feigning death. He was a key witness 
for the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Terauchi's theory of what happened in the motel room, Barnes and 
Cunningham were there as middlemen in the supposed drug transaction. Stevenson 
allegedly was the buyer and brought along his cousin, Brown. Hinton and a man 
he introduced as Steven Hicks supposedly had cocaine to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 As Brown and Barnes were about to test what was fake cocaine, Terauchi said, 
they were shot in the head. Then, according to Terauchi, Hicks allegedly shot 
Stevenson; Hinton shot at Cunningham, but missed. 
</P>
<P>
 An injured Stevenson fell on Cunningham, who remained on the floor, feigning 
death. Hinton and Hicks then allegedly left the motel room with the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes later, Stevenson staggered out of the motel onto Atlantic Boulevard 
near Emerson Avenue and bumped into his assailants. They chased Stevenson to a 
used-car lot next to the motel and killed him, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man Hinton called Hicks was never arrested because Cunningham could not 
positively place him at the murder scene. Hicks reportedly moved out of state 
shortly afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cunningham did place Hinton at the crime scene, he could not say 
whether Hinton had shot at anyone. Hinton maintained that Hicks had done all 
the shooting. The weapons used in the slayings were never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, we had a dead case," said Officer David Corrigan of the Monterey 
Park Police Department, who at the time was a detective investigating the 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
 The case lay dormant for nearly two years until Corrigan received a call from 
Terauchi sometime in late 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, Hinton was the suspect in the fatal shooting of Dwayne Reed, 
29, of Los Angeles. And Terauchi, who was preparing that murder case against 
Hinton, noticed not only that the suspect had been arrested then released in a 
previous case, but that the bullets in both cases were similar. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that on Aug. 9, 1989, Reed was pumping gas at a station on 
Imperial Highway when Hinton walked up and accused Reed of wanting to kill him. 
Witnesses said Reed, who knew Hinton, denied the allegation. 
</P>
<P>
 Hinton then reportedly said, "I don't trust you," as he pulled back a towel 
revealing a gun in his hand and shot Reed several times in the head. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bullets that killed Reed have the same characteristics as the bullets in 
the Monterey Park shootings -- same make, same caliber, same direction of twist 
and same numbers of lands and grooves. But we couldn't positively say it was 
the same gun," Corrigan said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Terauchi's office filed charges against Hinton for the Reed 
shooting, it filed murder charges in the Monterey Park slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's an absolute tenacious bulldog," said Corrigan of the Monterey Park 
prosecutor. "He grabbed onto the case no one wanted to touch and wouldn't let 
go." 
</P>
<P>
 Terauchi tried unsuccessfully to consolidate the cases. When a judge turned 
him down, he tried the Reed case. The jury hung, and Terauchi retried the case. 
On June 5, 1992, Hinton was found guilty of first-degree murder in Reed's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months later, court proceedings began against Hinton in the Monterey 
Park killings. Terauchi tried to introduce evidence from the Reed case to link 
Hinton to both, but his request was denied. 
</P>
<P>
 So with no more legal ammunition than the district attorney's office had had 
from the start, Terauchi went into trial on the Monterey Park case. 
</P>
<P>
 He introduced evidence that the bullets that killed Barnes and Brown came from 
different guns. Based upon the angles at which bullets were found in the bodies 
and in the motel room, Terauchi argued that Hicks could not have been the sole 
gunman. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense argued that Hinton was there to sell drugs on the night of the 
killings but was not involved in the shootings.

TEST FOR TOXINS IN BACK YARDS TURNS UP DDT; POLLUTION: OFFICIALS SAY 
CONCENTRATIONS OF THE LONG-BANNED PESTICIDE IN HARBOR GATEWAY AREA ARE NOT HIGH 
ENOUGH TO CAUSE ILLNESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM KOWSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal investigators who took soil samples from the back yards of 12 homes 
near Harbor Gateway in September were looking for contaminants that might have 
spread from the nearby Del Amo Pits, a proposed Superfund site. 
</P>
<P>
 But they were surprised to find that, while none of the soil samples contained 
unsafe levels of the toxic chemicals they were searching for, two of the 
samples contained unusually high levels of the banned insecticide DDT. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators, who announced their findings recently, were in the neighborhood 
to check whether any heavy metals from a former rubber manufacturing plant 
nearby had found their way into residents' yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The former plant, a 280-acre site known as Del Amo Pits, produced such 
byproducts as benzo(a)pyrene, a carcinogen, said Tom Dunkelman, U. S. 
Environmental Protection Agency project manager. He said the agency is at a 
loss to explain the source of the DDT. 
</P>
<P>
 Although EPA officials do not believe the DDT concentrations are high enough 
to cause illness, they intend to conduct additional tests next month at the two 
homes where DDT was found. If the next round of more intensive tests reveal 
high levels of the pesticide, federal officials might replace the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are not levels that would cause anyone to become sick over a short-term 
exposure," Dunkelman said. "The way in which EPA evaluates risk is very 
conservative and puts safety first. The risk numbers assume that people ingest 
a certain amount of soil every day for years." 
</P>
<P>
 Once a widely used pesticide, DDT has been banned in this country since 1972. 
People exposed to high doses of the contaminant for short periods typically 
suffer tremors, rashes and irritation of the eyes, nose and throat. DDT also 
has been found to cause cancer in laboratory animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, federal officials recommend taking precautions when the 
concentration of DDT exceeds 100 parts per million, although recent changes in 
how authorities assess human risks will probably lead to more stringent 
standards in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Samples from one back yard yielded DDT at a concentration of 32 parts per 
million, while the other contained DDT at 110 parts per million, leading the 
agency to advise the residents to wash their hands after working in the yard. 
Tests at the other 10 homes detected only traces of DDT, no more than 5 parts 
per million. 
</P>
<P>
 The two homes with soil containing substantially higher levels of DDT are next 
to each other on West 204th Street, between Normandie and New Hampshire avenues 
in an unincorporated area. 
</P>
<P>
 The elderly couple who live at the home with the higher DDT levels could not 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 At the home where the lower concentration of DDT was found, renter Cynthia 
Babich, 44, who regularly eats vegetables from her garden, said she is not 
worried about contamination because she grows her greens in beds with 
out-of-area soil. And, she believes, the several chickens she raises in the 
yard will be fine as long as they continue to lay eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am concerned on a planetary level more than a personal level," she said. 
"It would take 70 years of me ingesting DDT every day for there to be any 
health problems. Right now, our main concern is the red-tailed hawks that live 
in the fields next door." 
</P>
<P>
 EPA investigators are looking at the nearby Montrose Chemical Corp., a 13-acre 
Superfund site that produced the pesticide from 1947 until the plant closed in 
1982, as a possible source of the DDT. The company is currently working with 
the EPA to evaluate ways to clean up its former facility. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is also possible that the two homes were once sprayed with the 
pesticide to kill mosquitoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to find DDT just about anywhere you look across the state," 
Dunkelman said. "DDT was used across the county for mosquito control at one 
time. And this area, before it was developed, was an agricultural area, so it 
is likely the farmers applied DDT." 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental authorities began testing the neighborhoods' soil in the early 
1980s because of its proximity to the Montrose site and Del Amo Pits. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the entire Del Amo Pits area is a proposed Superfund site, the EPA 
has paid special attention in recent years to a 3.7-acre waste dump within the 
property that investigators said contained harmful levels of the heavy metals. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Shell Oil and Dow Chemical, the two companies that had operations 
on the site between 1955 and 1969, agreed to spend $10 million to figure out 
how to clean up soil and ground water contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA keeps a list of hazardous sites believed to pose the greatest health 
and environmental threats. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, 1,300 sites are on the Superfund National Priorities List, a 
designation which allows the EPA to enforce cleanup efforts against responsible 
parties or to spend money to ensure that sites containing hazardous waste are 
cleaned up.

 Can they beat the Broncos for the second consecutive week, third time this 
season, seventh time in a row at the Coliseum and ninth time in the last 10 
meetings overall? 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, teams facing such games stick to business and avoid comments that 
might find their way onto the opposing team's bulletin board. But the flow of 
words across the Rocky Mountains has been unusually strong this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Raider Coach Art Shell said he had heard that Denver quarterback John Elway 
had guaranteed a victory. Elway denied saying that. 
</P>
<P>
 Bronco Coach Wade Phillips was told that a San Francisco paper had quoted 
Raider owner Al Davis as saying the Broncos were scared of the Raiders. 
Phillips said he took that personally. 
</P>
<P>
 But once the ball is kicked off today, the flow of words will give way to the 
flow of adrenaline.  
</P>
<P>
 Today's game figures to be close. Fourteen of the last 21 between the teams 
have been won by three or fewer points. Six of the games have gone into 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Both games this season were decided by Jeff Jaeger field goals at the end, one 
with 16 seconds to play, the other in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 So how does Shell explain his team's mastery of Denver? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's no mastery," he said. "The players believe they're going to win. It's 
the players going out and getting it done. They believe, some kind of way, we 
are going to win against Denver." 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips agrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do think the Raiders believe they are going to beat us," he said. "But we 
believe we are going to beat them, so we'll see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the key factors today: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The quarterbacks: Any team that has John Elway for a big game has to feel 
good. After all, he is the architect of The Drive to the game-tying touchdown 
in the closing minutes of the AFC title game against the Cleveland Browns in 
1987, a game the Broncos won in overtime. Elway has rallied his team to victory 
in the fourth quarter 32 times in his 11 NFL seasons, has put Denver into three 
Super Bowls and is coming off his best season. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jeff Hostetler has won a Super Bowl with the New York Giants and has had a 
super year with the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, he drove the Raiders in the closing minutes of regulation against 
the Broncos, a la Elway, and threw the tying touchdown pass to Alexander Wright 
as time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The receivers: Can Denver shut down Tim Brown? Can the Raiders stop Shannon 
Sharpe? 
</P>
<P>
 Each has become the star receiver of his team. Each was nearly unstoppable 
last Sunday, Brown catching 11 passes for 173 yards and two touchdowns, Sharpe 
six for 115 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind these headliners, however, the Raiders appear stronger. The Broncos' 
Vance Johnson is sidelined because of a broken ankle suffered six weeks ago. 
Derek Russell and Sharpe have ankle injuries, but both are expected to play. 
Running back Rod Bernstine is sidelined because of a dislocated shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders, on the other hand, are deep. Wright and James Jett have the speed 
to outrun any defensive back. Ethan Horton has been dependable. And Rocket 
Ismail, although suffering from a sprained neck, also hopes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The running game: Neither team is going to throw any fear into opposing 
defenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Having lost Bernstine, the Broncos must depend on Robert Delpino, the former 
Ram, who is questionable because of a toe injury. 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of Greg Robinson, who has had knee surgery, the Raiders are 
sound healthy at this position, but confused. Ty Montgomery starts at tailback, 
though he was rarely used until last week, when he gained a team-high 44 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The lines: The Raiders protected Hostetler last week, but, seven days 
earlier at Green Bay, they surrendered eight sacks. Protecting Hostetler is a 
Raider must. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting to Elway is another. The Raiders did it in the first meeting this 
season, sacking him seven times. But they couldn't get to him last week. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The kickers: Phillips can be excused for not wanting to see Jeff Jaeger 
ever again. The Raider kicker beat the Broncos in the first meeting this season 
with a 53-yard field goal at Mile High Stadium with 16 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Jaeger beat the Broncos again, with a 47-yard field goal in 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Denver's Jason Elam had a chance to win that game on the previous drive, but 
missed from 40 yards. He made 26 of 35 attempts and scored 119 points during 
the season, fourth in the AFC and most for a Bronco since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 So who has the edge? The Raiders have momentum, the home field, fewer injuries 
and recent history. 
</P>
<P>
 But when these teams meet, the only safe assumption is that with the final 
seconds ticking away, the ball and the game probably will be up in the air. 
Blackout Lifted 
</P>
<P>
 The television blackout for today's Raider-Denver Bronco playoff game was 
lifted Saturday when Channel 4 purchased about 1,000 unsold tickets. Some of 
those tickets were returned for resale at the Coliseum beginning at 9 a.m. 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders were granted a two-day extension to sell out the Coliseum after 
14,000 tickets remained unsold at the original deadline of 1 p.m. Thursday.

NFL PLAYOFFS; FAVRE IS SHARPEST AT FINISH; NFC: HE SCRAMBLES BEFORE FINDING 
RECEIVER IN END ZONE AS PACKERS BEAT LIONS, 28-24. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For one magical moment Saturday, Green Bay Packer quarterback Brett Favre 
turned 40 yards of Silverdome turf into a playground. 
</P>
<P>
 His coach called for a standard pass to a wide receiver. With possibly one 
minute left in their season, Favre thought it stupid. 
</P>
<P>
 So he rolled left. He looked for his tight end, then he looked to run. 
</P>
<P>
 At the instant Favre realized he had no idea what he was doing, he saw 
receiver Sterling Sharpe standing alone in the right corner of the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured, what the heck, I'd give it the big heave-ho," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And so the Packers were tossed into the second round of the NFC playoffs, with 
Favre connecting with Sharpe on a touchdown pass that gave them a 28-24 victory 
over the Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
 The wonders of football's most enigmatic quarterback never cease. 
</P>
<P>
 One moment Favre was throwing the ball into the hands of cornerback Melvin 
Jenkins, then watching him run 15 yards to give the Lions a 10-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he was screaming at Lion defensive players. 
</P>
<P>
 The next moment he was being publicly scolded by Coach Mike Holmgren. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate watching films because sometimes I wonder, 'What the hell am I doing?' 
" Favre said. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the final moment, he was sending his team to Dallas for a second-round 
game next Sunday while sending the stunned Lions to their winter homes. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Packers' first playoff victory in a non-strike year since their 1967 
Super Bowl victory over the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "To lose like that is a killer," said Chris Spielman, Lion linebacker. "They 
beat us on a play that will be shown over and over until the end of time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions, behind Barry Sanders' 169 rushing yards and Brett Perriman's 150 
receiving yards, beat the Packers in every other way. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions outgained Green Bay, 410-293. They were so dominating, they appeared 
to overcome two end-zone interceptions thrown by Erik Kramer, including a 
second-half pass that was returned 101 yards -- a postseason record -- for a 
touchdown by George Teague. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so excited watching George, I wanted to run out and block for him," 
Favre said. "I was so happy, me and Frank Winters was swapping spit." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions also had four drives of 50 yards or more, including an 89-yard march 
that ended in a five-yard touchdown run by Derrick Moore with 8:27 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 That gave the Lions a 24-21 edge, the fourth time the lead had changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
 But a Lion offense that had survived by mixing Sanders runs and passes to 
Perriman suddenly lost its way. 
</P>
<P>
 A nine-play drive featured five runs by exhausted Sanders -- playing in his 
first game since Thanksgiving -- and only one pass to Perriman, who did not 
catch a ball in the final 17:47. 
</P>
<P>
 The Packer offense took over on its 29-yard line with 2:26 remaining. Two 
passes and two runs later, it was on the Lions' 40. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it was the Lion defense that lost its way. With Favre hurrying to the line 
of scrimmage, cornerback Kevin Scott said he was not told what coverage was 
being called. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't hear, and nobody told me, so I just looked at the other defensive 
backs to see what they were doing," Scott said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later they were staring at him when he covered Sharpe until the 
10-yard line and then left him alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharpe was so alone when he caught the ball five yards deep in the end zone, 
he looked stunned. Instead of celebrating, he held out his hands in amazement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew what the call was," Spielman grumbled. "I thought everyone else knew 
what the call was." 
</P>
<P>
 Favre was so excited, he tore off his helmet, ran halfway off the field, then 
jumped into the arms of teammate Mark Chmura, knocking him to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 His teammates said they will be reacting with similar fervor this week at a 
chance to gain revenge for a 36-14 loss to the Cowboys at Dallas earlier this 
season.  
</P>
<P>
 "This will be the biggest game this organization has had in 20-something 
years," said Matt Brock, Packer defensive lineman. "And right now, we believe 
we can beat anybody. We feel anybody can make the big play." 
</P>
<P>
 No stranger thing has happened to them this year than that touchdown pass, but 
finishing a close second was a postgame appearance before reporters by Sharpe. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharpe, who caught all three of Favre's touchdown passes, has not participated 
in newspaper interviews in four years. But he broke his silence to say that a 
toe injury he has endured during his record-breaking season has been worse than 
imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't practice, I can't run, all I do is take pain-killers every Sunday and 
see what happens," Sharpe said. "This has been a long struggle." 
</P>
<P>
 And so it will be a long winter for the Lions, who survived numerous 
controversies during the fall to record their second division championship in 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm numb," Kramer said, still in uniform an hour after the game. "I was 
feeling we should be playing next Sunday. And now, we're not." 
</P>
<P>
 In the other locker room, Favre, who threw four interceptions in last week's 
division championship loss in the Silverdome, was still celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
 "As much as everyone hates to take chances, I love to, even when it gets me in 
trouble," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And especially when it doesn't.

JIM MURRAY: ONLY THING MISSING FROM GAME IS LUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're a golfer, you'd want to look and play just like Greg Norman. The 
inverted pyramid build, wide shoulders on top of no waist, the powerful stride, 
the move into the ball.  
</P>
<P>
 You're to golf what Dempsey was to boxing. An attacker. A knockout puncher. A 
slugger. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't romance a golf course. Bring it flowers. He grabs it by the hair 
and tries to drag it to the cave. Not for him defensive golf. Gimme-the-wood 
golf. Fore-on-the-right golf! Charge! 
</P>
<P>
 Only the exciting ones get nicknames. The Hawk (Hogan). The Bear (Nicklaus). 
The Squire (Sarazen). The Slammer. The Walrus. The Haig.  
</P>
<P>
 Norman was the Shark. And Norman fit the description. He looked predatory, 
restless. Like something swimming around a leaky boat with a fin showing. Jaws 
with a nine-iron. Let the golf course show the first sign of weakness and it 
was like blood in the water to a school of great whites. A birdie frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 He had teeth that could light a room. And, with his Australian bush hat on and 
his rollicking walk, he made golf into theater. With Nicklaus and Palmer gone, 
he was the undisputed drawing card of the great game. 
</P>
<P>
 But you wouldn't want to sit next to him in a lifeboat. Greg Norman's luck was 
so bad, he would probably have stood in line to get tickets on the Titanic. You 
wouldn't want to back his play at the crap table. He'd seven out every time he 
got the dice the way he was going. 
</P>
<P>
 His family coat-of-arms should have been a coiled snake about to bite on a 
coat of No. 13s rampant on a field of black cats. 
</P>
<P>
 You remember that character in L'il Abner that used to go around with a cloud 
over his head, leaking rain? Joe Bflspltk? That was Greg Norman on a golf 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 It was as if the gods of golf were trying to get even with him for all those 
birdies and eagles. For hitting all those 285-yard drives, 250-yard four-irons, 
hitting flags with chips. 
</P>
<P>
 Lots of golfers have bad luck. Hogan's foot slipping on the 90th hole at 
Olympic Club in the 1955 Open. Snead gaffing an 18-inch putt at St. Louis in 
1947. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bad luck didn't follow them around. 
</P>
<P>
 The things that happened to Greg Norman shouldn't. Never mind Larry Mize 
chipping in over his head to win a Masters playoff. Never mind Bob Tway coming 
out of a sand trap over his head to snatch a PGA. Never mind Robert Gamez 
sending a 170-yard seven-iron into the cup to win another while Norman is 
standing there rehearsing his trophy acceptance speech. Never mind David Frost 
chipping out of a trap to yank still another. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Craig Wood in the '30s, Greg Norman is the only guy to lose a playoff in 
all four of the majors. Even golf's skewed law of averages should have dictated 
that he win one of those. Or even two. 
</P>
<P>
 Golf doesn't recognize laws of averages. Or even royalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though it's in its own best interests, golf goes out of its way to strike 
down its stars. Even Hogan lost a playoff for an Open. Arnold Palmer lost 
(count 'em!) three. But Arnold won the only Masters playoff he was in. 
</P>
<P>
 How much of ill luck is self-inflicted? In Norman's case, a measure. In his 
British Open playoff loss, he came up to an extra hole that had a sand trap so 
far out it was meant to catch second shots. Greg Norman dumped his first shot 
in there. It was a magnificent shot, 300 yards. It was also a stupid shot. 
</P>
<P>
 In another British Open, trailing Nick Faldo by two shots, Norman saw Faldo 
hit his tee shot into hip-high gorse. Norman then hit his ball into one of 
those halfway-to-China pot bunkers to toss the advantage away. 
</P>
<P>
 The facts of the matter are, the public loves this. At the Mercedes 
Championship here at the La Costa Resort and Spa this week, there is no doubt 
who The Man is. When he steps out on the tee with his digger hat at a rakish 
angle and his jaunty stride and take-no-prisoners swing, the Shark is the 
game's matinee idol. 
</P>
<P>
 He is half-hero, half-martyr. They don't know whether to cheer for him or cry 
for him. They wonder what nobody on the tour will next jinx him. You don't know 
whether to cover your eyes or throw your hat in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the worthies who have contributed to his doom: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mize, who eliminated him with a 140-yard chip shot at the Masters in '87, 
didn't win another tournament for six years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tway, who holed out over his head at the '86 PGA, almost disappeared from 
view when he bottomed out on the money list (179th) with $47,632 earned in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mark Calcavecchia, who bested him in the '89 British Open playoff, has won 
only one tournament since. 
</P>
<P>
 The average man thus victimized would long since have retired to a rubber room 
with all sharp objects removed and afraid to go out and would sit in a darkened 
room muttering curses. But Greg Norman thinks it's funny. "You guys make more 
of it than I do," he says to the press. "That's just golf." 
</P>
<P>
 That's just golf. The most perverse of sporting endeavors. The most malign of 
games. Eighteen holes of institutional malice. No one escapes its mockery, its 
vindictiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Norman should feel as if he's stepping into a castle in Transylvania when 
he gets on a first tee. He should listen for the sound of wolves howling, bats 
flying. 
</P>
<P>
 But he finished the third round at the Mercedes Championships Saturday only 
four shots out of the lead shared by Fred Couples and Phil Mickelson. 
</P>
<P>
 If he makes up the four shots and gets in a playoff, should he toss his clubs 
in the trunk and head for the parking lot and concede another miracle shot to 
seal his doom? 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Norman doesn't think so. "I'm playing good golf, I feel good about '94," 
he protests. "I think it's going to be a big year for me. I have to go back 
home (to Australia), then to Dubai and the Middle East, but I look forward to 
joining the tour at Doral and going on to a great season." 
</P>
<P>
 He feels he's owed a Masters and a PGA. But the gods of golf may have their 
own wicked idea for their favorite whipping boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Just to be safe, don't get in any elevators with him. And if one more guy 
holes out over his head, look for Greg, no matter what he says, to be the first 
guy in history to have to learn to play golf in a straitjacket.

NFL PLAYOFFS; CHIEFS ESCAPE STEELERS; AFC: MONTANA THROWS FOURTH-DOWN TOUCHDOWN 
PASS, SPARKS OVERTIME DRIVE TO LOWERY FIELD GOAL AND 27-24 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kansas City quarterback Joe Montana watched Nick Lowery's 43-yard kick sail 
wide to the right with 12 seconds to play and figured that was it for the 
Chiefs' Super Bowl hopes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured the way things had been going for me," Montana said, "we had to be 
behind." 
</P>
<P>
 But Montana's scoreboard double take gave him hope -- the Chiefs were still 
tied with the Pittsburgh Steelers, 24-24. 
</P>
<P>
 And on a day when little went right at times, Montana and Lowery were granted 
second chances -- in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana guided the drive that was capped by Lowery kicking a 32-yard field 
goal 11:03 into overtime to give the Chiefs a 27-24 victory in an AFC wild card 
game at Arrowhead Stadium on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 After failing to complete his first seven passes, Montana was perfect on his 
final five, leading the Chiefs on a 66-yard drive that set up Lowery's winning 
kick. 
</P>
<P>
 Was Lowery confident that Montana, who completed 22 of 28 passes for 203 yards 
in the second half, would give him another shot at a winning field goal? 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, you never underestimate the best quarterback in the game," Lowery said. 
"He didn't play his best game, but he got us in position to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Of his missed 43-yarder that could have won it in regulation, Lowery said that 
he was rushed on the field after coaches had used most of the time after the 
previous play to discuss whether to kick the field goal on third down or run 
another play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little rushed on the first kick," Lowery said. "I usually take 15 
seconds to step off a kick and get ready, but I only had seven or eight seconds 
on that one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess you could say I was Freddy Krueger -- I came back from the dead 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 His field goal kept alive any hopes Montana has for adding a fifth Super Bowl 
ring to the record-tying four he won with the San Francisco 49ers. It also 
ended the Chiefs' six-game home losing streak to the Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas City advanced to the second round of the playoffs for only the second 
time since 1971, and will play next Sunday at Houston, which beat them, 30-0, 
in the second game of the season. Montana was sidelined at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs appeared to be headed home early again when the Steelers took a 
24-17 lead with 4:11 to play on quarterback Neil O'Donnell's 22-yard touchdown 
pass to Eric Green. O'Donnell completed 23 of 42 passes for 286 yards and three 
touchdowns, but the Steelers managed only 129 yards after halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana and Lowery might not have pulled off the comeback if it had not been 
for Keith Cash, the Chiefs' backup tight end. When Pittsburgh lined up to punt 
with 2:29 to play, the Steelers all but ignored Cash and set up their 
protection to stop cornerback Albert Lewis, the team's top punt blocker. 
</P>
<P>
 Cash made them pay, brushing off a partial block to bat down Mark Royals' punt 
at the Steelers' 40-yard line. Fred Jones scooped the ball up and took off down 
the right sideline to the Steeler nine, giving Montana a chance to tie the 
score. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Marcus Allen carries netted only two yards, and Montana threw incomplete 
to Cash, setting up a fourth down at the Steeler seven. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana dropped back and looked for J.J. Birden, but passed to a wide-open Tim 
Barnett in the back of the end zone as the Chiefs tied the score at 24 with 
1:43 left in regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing there and I was trying to buy some time back there," 
Montana said. "I had great protection from the line. I had great protection all 
day." 
</P>
<P>
 Montana put the Chiefs in position to win by completing four passes for 36 
yards on a 47-yard drive to the Steeler 25. But Lowery missed and the game went 
into overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing despite a sore back and ribs after being hit by end Donald Evans, 
Montana slipped and fell in the backfield on a key fourth down at the 
Pittsburgh 42 in the second quarter. He regularly overthrew receivers in the 
first half, and wore gloves for the first time in his career to combat the 
sub-freezing temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Montana took the gloves off after the Chiefs' second possession, having failed 
to complete a pass with them on. 
</P>
<P>
 His first completion -- 25 yards to Willie Davis -- came with 3:45 to play in 
the first quarter. Evans hit Montana hard as he released the ball, and the 
quarterback struggled to the sideline with sore ribs. 
</P>
<P>
 In came backup Dave Krieg, who completed the only pass he attempted -- a 
23-yarder to a diving Birden that tied the score at 7-7 with 1:39 to play in 
the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs got some help on the drive from cornerback D.J. Johnson, who was 
ejected for kicking Barnett in the face after a two-yard loss by Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just turned around and started kicking me," Barnett said. "I guess a 
defensive back doesn't like it when a wide receiver knocks him down. I played 
smart and didn't retaliate." 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't have to. An unsportsmanlike conduct penalty gave the Chiefs the ball 
at the Pittsburgh 42, and the officials ejected Johnson, who gestured to the 
booing crowd as he was led to the locker room by security guards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chiefs had 401 total yards against a team that had given up only 283.2 per 
game, best in the AFC. And the Chiefs figure it will be just as tough next week 
at Houston, which features one of the toughest defenses in the NFL.  
</P>
<P>
 "You can't go down there scared," Kansas City safety Kevin Ross said. "The 
Oilers' game is intimidation. And they've got a guy, (defensive coordinator) 
Buddy Ryan, and he makes you think about intimidation." 
</P>
<P>
 But the way Montana played in the second half Saturday, can anybody stop the 
Chiefs? 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe played hurt today," Kansas City defensive end Neil Smith said. "You have 
to take your hat off to a guy any time he gets it done when he's banged up. And 
now, our road to the Super Bowl is getting shorter and shorter."

MIKE DOWNEY: NFL PLAYOFFS; HOSTETLER COMES TO TOWN TO CHANGE A FOOTBALL FLAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Hostetler has two concerns today -- the Denver Broncos and his clothes. 
Things have a strange way of happening to the quarterback's garments after big 
victories. There was the time when he found them cut to ribbons after guiding 
the New York Giants to their one-point Super Bowl XXV victory over the Buffalo 
Bills, forcing him to leave the greatest game of his life in duds scrounged up 
by a clubhouse boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was an experience a couple of weeks ago at the Coliseum, when once 
again Hostetler returned to a dressing room to discover that he had places to 
go but not a thing to wear. His instincts settled on Steve Wisniewski, the 
285-pound bouncer who spends his Sundays providing the Raider quarterback with 
protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Wiz, that's who did it," detective Hostetler deduced. He swore vengeance, 
in his own sweet time, in his own sweet way. 
</P>
<P>
 Days later, Hoss was all who-me innocence when Wisniewski found a smelly fish 
in his hotel bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Hang around the Raiders long enough and much will be said about Hostetler's 
knack for the give and take, about how in such a snappy manner he became not 
only the team's new leader but one of the guys. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler himself recognized this need. He made the observation soon after 
setting foot in camp and recalled it the other day while rehearsing for today's 
AFC playoff game, saying: "The guys here were just looking for someone to play 
hard and be a leader by example, rather than just throwing out words." 
</P>
<P>
 It pleases him, grown men playing follow the leader. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something I've always been able to do," Hostetler said of setting an 
example. "It's the most powerful type of leadership there is." 
</P>
<P>
 Faith, too, can move mountains. This is something Jeff Hostetler believes with 
all his heart. He is a Mennonite who is quite familiar with the power of 
natural phenomena, this farm boy from Pennsylvania, having grown up a near cry 
from valleys laid waste in 1889 by the great Johnstown Flood. Out there along 
lonesome Pennsylvania 601, near the signpost now marked "Hostetler Road," was 
where he learned early that self-reliance linked with faith can carry someone 
through any storm. 
</P>
<P>
 There was, for example, the terrible fire that tore through Norm and Dolly 
Hostetler's property when Jeff was only 6. Their barn burned. Nine heifers were 
killed. Insurance covered little more than half the loss. The unincorporated 
120-acre hay and dairy farm with the Hollsopple, Pa., mailing address was 
devastated. Had it not been for a "Mennonite Disaster Team," 30 strong, that 
came voluntarily to lay in 3,000 bales of hay in two days, the Hostetlers could 
have been ruined. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday church services, morning and evening, saw them through every crisis. 
There was the Hong Kong flu that same summer that sapped the strength of Jeff's 
father when the haying needed to be done. Late at night there at Dolly's 
Delight, the farm that bore her name, seven children drew strength from a 
mother who read Scripture to them or were entertained by quoted passages from 
Thornton Wilder that she had committed to memory. She even cited an emotional 
condition she called alexithymia that discouraged some people from 
communicating and sharing an experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Such spiritual strengthening got Hostetler through the darkest days of his 
life, times that made a mere football game pale in importance. It enabled him 
to endure months of operations and setbacks after his firstborn son had turned 
blue from a pulmonary disorder within 12 hours of birth. He fought successfully 
for life, with Jeff by his bedside, whispering: "Hang in there, buddy." 
</P>
<P>
 It steeled him so he could remain businesslike on Super Bowl Sunday when the 
mother he adored was so frail from arthritis and knee replacements that she 
needed cortisone shots to sit through the game. It was the last game of Jeff's 
she ever saw. 
</P>
<P>
 So, no need to wonder how strong Jeff Hostetler is, how resolute. He 
demonstrates it daily to a Raider organization that prides itself on toughness. 
He's been pounded and intentionally grounded. He had a leg tugged like a 
wishbone at his debut in Los Angeles and was knocked senseless and hospitalized 
on a cold day in Green Bay. Like most quarterbacks, he wakes up Sundays praying 
for strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "He takes a shot, picks himself up, takes another, picks himself up," says 
another of his bodyguards, Max Montoya, who has been lining up in front of 
quarterbacks for 15 pro seasons. "The man's tough as nails." 
</P>
<P>
 Art Shell, too, was an offensive lineman before becoming a Raider coach. He, 
too, has seen quarterbacks come and go, good and bad, hard and soft. He is a 
man who understands toughness, whose very name implies it. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Shell of Hostetler: "This guy has taken some hits, a normal man wouldn't 
have gotten off the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Only so much is clear to a football club when it demands toughness from 
someone new. The only thing the Raiders really knew about Hostetler was that he 
had an accurate arm, nimble legs and a good head on his shoulders, having 
carried a 3.92 grade-point average in college and having been smart enough to 
marry the West Virginia coach's daughter, prompting Don Nehlen to laugh and 
say: "Well, at least I know where he is." 
</P>
<P>
 But how tough was he? The Raiders wondered. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they picked him up at the airport. Mike White, one of the coaches, was 
there to meet the new quarterback, as was another representative of the team. 
Off they rode together to introduce Hostetler to his new town and his new team, 
to escort him to their El Segundo training camp, where he was so unfamiliar to 
his new employers that they asked Hostetler to toss a few dozen passes and 
demonstrate his arm. Him, a quarterback who had won a Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 On the way from the airport, the car had a flat tire. Some might have taken 
that as a bad omen, a discouraging sign on a quarterback's first day in town. 
Instead, that was a day when the Raiders got a new slant on their new leader, a 
really good look at their new quarterback in action. They got a pretty fair 
indication of what kind of individual had come to California to take this 
team's football into his strong hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler changed the tire.

MORNING BRIEFING: RECORD SHOWS WARD HEADED FOR STARDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To those who doubt that Heisman Trophy winner Charlie Ward of Florida State 
will be a star in the NFL, Jay Mariotti of the Chicago Sun-Times has these 
words of warning: 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't ever doubt him. The world learned that long ago. They said Ward 
couldn't play college ball after five leg operations (he did). They said Ward 
couldn't start at a school that never had a black quarterback (he did). They 
said he couldn't star in two sports (he did). Now they say he can't play in the 
NFL." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Ward: To those who doubt that Ward could be a star in the NBA, Marty 
Blake, the NBA's chief scout, has this to say: 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the best point guard in America." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Name the only three NFL teams to finish .500 or better in each of 
the last seven seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Hot and cold: The South Pacific island of American Samoa plans to send a 
two-man bobsled team and an Alpine skier to next month's Lillehammer Olympics. 
American Samoa is 2,600 miles south of Hawaii and the temperature is never 
below 70 degrees. With a population of about 40,000, it is a U.S. territory 
with sporting autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 Punched out: Michael Wilbon of the Washington Post writes that Buddy Ryan has 
the Houston Oilers over a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without the Budman, the Oilers are . . . well, you know, soft. Just another 
pretty, indoor, AFC team capable of blowing a 35-3 lead in the playoffs and 
incapable of beating anybody with real muscle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Oilers are as dependent on Ryan as the Chiefs are on Joe Montana, as the 
Cowboys are on Emmitt Smith. Which is why there's little if anything the Oilers 
can do about the fact that Ryan is a complete fool, as evidenced by his 
punching offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride on the sideline Sunday night in 
the Astrodome." 
</P>
<P>
 One more goal: The New York Rangers' Mike Gartner recently became the sixth 
NHL player to score 600 goals, but he's still looking for his first Stanley 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would I trade everything I've accomplished for one Stanley Cup?" Gartner 
asked, repeating a question. "No, that's asking me to trade in too many 
wonderful experiences. But I can tell you I have one goal left. . . . I want to 
experience the Stanley Cup, and I know this team can win it." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: San Francisco 49ers, New Orleans Saints and Houston Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Auburn quarterback Patrick Nix, after an 11-0 season: "Maybe next 
year we can go 11-0 again. Maybe if we win 22 games in a row, we'll get a 
little more respect." SHAV GLICK

KINGS SEND CARSON ON ROAD AGAIN; HOCKEY: THIS TIME IT'S TO VANCOUVER, FOR WARD 
AND A DRAFT CHOICE. RED WINGS ARE 6-3 WINNERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Little-used King center Jimmy Carson left Los Angeles for the second time in 
his NHL career when he was traded to the Vancouver Canucks on Saturday for 
struggling forward Dixon Ward and a draft choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Several hours later, the Kings lost to Detroit, 6-3, at the Forum before a 
sellout crowd of 16,005. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the circumstances surrounding the trade of Carson were drastically 
different. In 1988, he went to Edmonton in the blockbuster Wayne Gretzky deal, 
and the Kings believed they were trading away a budding superstar. He was 
coming off a 55-goal season. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, Carson has four goals and 11 points in 25 games. He was scratched 
for five consecutive games. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward scored 22 goals as a rookie last season, but he had only seven points in 
33 games with the Canucks this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson's second turn with the Kings was decidedly disappointing. He returned 
to them last Jan. 29 in six-player trade with the Red Wings. Detroit defenseman 
Paul Coffey was the other key player in the transaction. The only remaining 
player with the Kings from that deal is forward Gary Shuchuk. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very nice to know I'm going someplace where the coach (Pat Quinn) wants 
me and he's also the GM," said Carson, who has been traded four times in six 
years and will be reunited with his first NHL coach. "It'll be good for my 
career. It can only go up when you're not playing." 
</P>
<P>
 His lack of playing time became an issue in the recent power struggle between 
King Coach Barry Melrose and front office of team President Roy Mlakar and Nick 
Beverley -- especially since Mlakar and Beverley signed Carson, 25, to a 
three-year, $3.3-million contract in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Many view the trade as a victory for Melrose. But Beverley steered clear of 
putting the situation into a political context. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't look at it that way -- winning or losing," he said. "The only winning 
and losing is on the ice. We've done something together to help the team win. 
Everyone is in agreement." 
</P>
<P>
 How high a draft pick the Kings receive is believed to be tied to Carson's 
performance in Vancouver. He is certain to get plenty of ice time, especially 
with center Cliff Ronning suffering a separated shoulder Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson, who had been scratched 11 times all season, spoke Saturday afternoon 
with King owner Bruce McNall, Mlakar and Beverley. But he left without speaking 
to Melrose. 
</P>
<P>
 Was he bitter? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think bitterness is a good thing," Carson said. "But a lot of things 
weren't handled properly. I've wasted half a season. I wish this had been done 
in the summertime when we negotiated the contract. We wanted the coach involved 
in the negotiations. They said they this is what he wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Melrose's point couldn't have been made clearer when he benched Carson for 
most of the Stanley Cup finals against Montreal in June. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jimmy has offensive talent," Melrose said. "But I have Gretzky and Jari 
Kurri. In the scheme of things, there wasn't room for another offensive player. 
He played 25 games and had four goals. It was like a square peg trying to fit 
into a round hole." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost everyone else realized long ago that Carson was never going to play for 
Melrose. And Melrose was not the first coach to find fault in Carson. The same 
thing had happened in Edmonton and Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is obvious, he seems to be at the end of his rope with the coach," Quinn 
said. "It is a risk, let's face it. We don't know what has happened between 
Jimmy and his coach out there. Maybe there is something we don't know about, 
but the upside feeling is good." 
</P>
<P>
 Quinn had expressed interest in Carson about a month ago but balked at picking 
up his entire salary. Beverley refused to say whether the Kings were paying 
some of Carson's salary, but it is not out of the question because Ward is 
earning $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward had not been playing a lot in Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't surprised, but you're always sort of shocked when it happened," he 
said. "As soon as I was tapped on the shoulder to go see Pat Quinn, I knew I 
was being traded to L.A. Well, I'm very happy and excited." King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings trailed, 4-3, heading into the third period but gave up two goals in 
the first 7:08 of the third for the final margin, including a shorthanded goal 
by Red Wing forward Keith Primeau. . . . Detroit right wing Dino Ciccarelli 
scored his 500th goal at 4:20 of the third. He is the 19th player in NHL 
history to score 500. . . . The Red Wings outshot the Kings, 44-32.

WHEN ONE TEARDROP IS A TORRENT OF HOPE; HORSE RACING: AS TRAINER JEFF LUKAS 
REMAINS IN A COMA, HIS FAMILY CHERISHES EACH SIGN OF POSSIBLE RECOVERY.

<P>
 The ward is so quiet when Wayne Lukas gets there. Beeps from a few monitors. 
Pulses from a few phones. The nurses all know him, and by now he knows all of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen, on day duty. Kelly, on nights. Rendy, who called four times on 
Christmas Day to inquire how he was doing. They and the others, pulling 12-hour 
shifts. Sticking around afterward, simply to see if there was anything else 
they could do. Handing manuals on brain trauma to Wayne, so he could study up 
on the fate that had befallen his son. So he could understand what the monitors 
meant. So he could read the vital signs. 
</P>
<P>
 The nurses. They took Brady Wayne Lukas, age 3 1/2, by the hand and led him 
into an anteroom of the Huntington Memorial Hospital to help him understand. 
Brady had been wondering why his daddy hadn't been home. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Lukas had always set aside one hour per night to read bedside stories to 
his boy. Ten days before Christmas, Brady's daddy did not come home. He was 
knocked down by a horse. He was knocked unconscious. He had lapsed into a coma 
and his condition was grave. Wayne Lukas had witnessed what had happened to his 
son, before disbelieving eyes. Now his grandson wanted some answers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where's my dad?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 So, they took Brady to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 He entered the room and saw his father on the bed, sleeping the deepest sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wake him up," Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Lukas bent to touch his hand and said: "I would love to wake him up." 
</P>
<P>
 No one could. Jeff would only awaken on his own. Long days and longer nights 
would pass before there was even a glimmer of life. The stillness continued. 
The cerebral pressure fluctuated. He lost 39 pounds, unable to take nutrition 
even intravenously. And then, a flicker of movement. A blink. A hint of 
comprehension. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff's wife, Linda, squeezed his hand. His father, Wayne, whispered into his 
ear. He read the daily sports page to his son. He told of the phone calls, the 
faxes, the letters. One from Gerald Ford. One from George Steinbrenner. Bob 
Knight, checking in daily. Then that uplifting moment came, when Jeff moved his 
hand. Not much, but he moved it. 
</P>
<P>
 The nurses. They took Brady Lukas to a room occupied by a mannequin. Tubes 
protruded from it, every which way. Wires were tethered to it, machines 
connected to it. They explained how oxygen is supplied to the human brain. They 
showed the boy a syringe, and how one works. They let him examine the model, 
explore it, ask questions. He asked what "head injury" meant. Brady is a sharp 
boy. He listens. He learns. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned to his father's room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you taking good care of my dad?" Brady asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a head injury," Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK," Brady said. 
</P>
<P>
 And he began making tapes. At home, Brady spoke into a hand-held recorder, 
making conversation with his father. Now he would tell him bedtime stories. Day 
by day, he would fill up the tapes. He or his mother or grandfather would go to 
the hospital. One of them would press the recorder to Jeff Lukas' ear. They 
would never be sure how much he would hear. All they could do was check for a 
response. For life. 
</P>
<P>
 Christmas Eve came. The holidays had been all but forgotten. Wayne Lukas had 
tried to go about his business, training horses at Santa Anita, but the 
distraction made it difficult. Out the threshold of Barn 66, he had a clear 
view of the washing stall where Tabasco Cat, a magnificent horse, a potential 
Kentucky Derby horse, had broken free from his rein and gone galloping along 
the hardpan. 
</P>
<P>
 When Wayne Lukas heard the commotion outside his office around 8:30 on the 
morning of Dec. 15, he went outside in time to see his 36-year-old son stand in 
front of Tabasco Cat, trying to intercept the stampeding horse. Struck, he 
flipped into the air. Jeff's skull struck the gravel. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne rushed to his side. "Call for an ambulance!" he shouted, and an exercise 
girl did. Riders and grooms came running. Wayne felt his son's forehead gently 
and spoke his name. There was no response. 
</P>
<P>
 The wait for the paramedics seemed endless, remembers Wayne, 58, one of the 
top trainers in the business. And then suddenly he had a vision, or at least 
what he thought was a vision. A woman in a crisp white dress. A nurse. What was 
she doing there so quickly, near the stables of a race track? 
</P>
<P>
 She turned out to be Denise Constantinide, not a nurse but a technician from 
the Dolly Green Nuclear Imaging Center, an equine facility on the Santa Anita 
grounds. She knelt and felt for a pulse. It was weak, but it was there. 
</P>
<P>
 It was some solace until the paramedics came. They prepared to take Jeff to a 
nearby clinic. No, an onlooker said, take him to Huntington, they have a trauma 
center there. Take him by helicopter. Wayne Lukas has this man's name. He hopes 
to thank him properly some day. He hopes this man helped save his son's life. 
</P>
<P>
 But first he must wait. The vigil continues. Wayne was so hopeful Thursday 
when he found out that Jeff had lifted his hand to his face. His condition had 
changed from critical to serious. But any emergency was possible. The brain 
pressure had risen dramatically when he was moved to another room for a CAT 
scan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another day we finally had the cerebral pressure in check and then the 
pneumonia hit us," Wayne says, making his daily call to his son's side Friday. 
"Jeff's temperature shot up to 104. But today things look better. The scans 
look excellent. The nurses taught me how to read the scans. The scans look 
excellent today." 
</P>
<P>
 He is unnerved. He tries to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably therapeutic for me to talk about it," Wayne says later, in his 
office. The private phone number to Jeff's room is pinned to a bulletin board 
above him. He has horses running, horses he and Jeff have trained. He will go 
back to the hospital soon and read today's news to him. In the news this day, 
he sees that Virginia Kelley, the mother of President Clinton, has died of 
cancer at 70. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in Arkansas with her, at the races," Wayne says. "When I was about to 
leave, she said: 'Would you write on my program for me? Write something to Bill 
so that he'll know you and I spoke.' I've got Bill Clinton in a couple of my 
win pictures from races in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, I took her program and wrote: Dear Bill: In thoroughbred racing, 85% of 
the production comes from the dam. So everything you have, remember, you owe 
85% of it to your mother. I'll bet he got a kick out of that." 
</P>
<P>
 The phone rings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Denny Crum! Hi, coach, how you doin'?" Wayne says. He chats with the 
Louisville basketball coach awhile. Wayne once coached basketball. Bob Knight 
is as close a friend as he has. But so many have called. He gabs animatedly 
with Crum about horses and about his alma mater, Wisconsin, winning the Rose 
Bowl and then in hushed tones about Jeff, and thanks him for calling, hangs up 
and says: "Half the basketball coaches in the country must have called by now. 
These guys keep me sane." 
</P>
<P>
 It is not easy to behave normally. Everyone so wanted to make Christmas as 
normal as possible for Brady, for the brave boy who sat there making tapes. 
Brady turned off the recorder and wrote his letter to Santa Claus. He placed it 
next to a plate of cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Santa,  
</P>
<P>
 The cookies are for you.  
</P>
<P>
 Please leave one present for my Dad.  
</P>
<P>
 Brady Lukas  
</P>
<P>
 Christmas morning, Brady found his own present, an electric go-kart. He went 
for a ride. There is a fountain at the end of the street near his house. Brady 
drove the little car that far. Then he made another tape for his father. 
</P>
<P>
 The tape was taken to the hospital. It was pressed next to Jeff Lukas' ear. 
His son's voice said: "Dad. I rode my go-kart down to the fountain today. Dad, 
I wore my helmet. No head injuries!" 
</P>
<P>
 A teardrop ran down Jeff Lukas' cheek. 
</P>
<P>
 He had heard.

 Rafer Johnson, the former UCLA athlete who won the Olympic decathlon in 1960 
and 24 years later lit the Olympic torch at the Los Angeles Summer Games, 
tonight will receive the NCAA's Theodore Roosevelt Award. 
</P>
<P>
 The award, known as the "Teddy," is considered the most prestigious honor the 
NCAA can bestow on an individual. Previous winners include former presidents 
Dwight Eisenhower, Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan and George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, known for his business and civic endeavors, will receive the award 
during the NCAA's honors dinner, part of the association's 88th annual 
convention. DANNY ROBBINS

NO MAJOR CHANGES ARE EXPECTED AT NCAA CONVENTION; LEGISLATION: SHOWDOWNS ON 
GENDER EQUITY, CUTTINGS COSTS AREN'T FORECAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 As representatives from NCAA schools and conferences left the association's 
1993 convention in Dallas, it seemed fitting that the group's next meeting 
would take place less than a block from the Alamo. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the '93 convention had been relatively tame, many had predicted a 
showdown in '94 over two issues -- gender equity and cost containment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like people are waiting for a piano to fall on them," Donna Lopiano, 
executive director of the Women's Sports Foundation, said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, they are still waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 The college presidents and athletic administrators who assemble today in San 
Antonio for the 88th annual NCAA convention will face a legislative agenda of 
174 proposals -- none of which will change the landscape of college sports. 
</P>
<P>
 So cut and dried is the agenda, in fact, that many participants are 
approaching the meeting mainly to swap ideas on such non-agenda matters as the 
possibility of a Division I-A football playoff and the realignment of 
conferences. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tom Hansen, Pacific 10 Conference commissioner: "The more interesting 
material is probably going to be out in the hallway." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's convention was expected to be contentious because of the work of 
two NCAA panels -- the gender-equity task force and the special committee to 
review financial conditions in college sports. The agenda includes legislation 
developed by both groups, but none of it is particularly weighty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do think the convention has taken on a much different look (from what had 
been expected)," said Jim Haney, executive director of the National Assn. of 
Basketball Coaches and former commissioner of the Big West Conference. "That's 
not to say there aren't going to be disagreements." 
</P>
<P>
 Gender equity, the focus of much hallway discussion a year ago, will be 
addressed through two proposals. One urges schools to comply with federal and 
state laws. The other allows schools to sponsor a series of "emerging" sports 
for women as a means of maintaining NCAA membership. 
</P>
<P>
 Judith Albino, president of the University of Colorado and a member of the 
gender-equity task force, said the legislation creating new sports for women is 
significant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It adds sports, and that's a big change," she said. "The NCAA does not often 
add sports." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, bolder notions, such as redistributing financial resources or 
scholarships, have been left for another day. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that most institutions are not in compliance with federal law requiring 
equal opportunities in athletics for men and women -- commonly known as Title 
IX -- Lopiano, who served as a consultant for the task force, said the NCAA is 
simply using window dressing to deal with the gender equity issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody is willing to bite the bullet and put spending caps on anything or 
change the definitions of scholarships -- any of the big, tough economic things 
to lower the cost of intercollegiate athletics -- and use the savings to comply 
with Title IX," she said last week. "Until schools are ready to do that, 
they're going to get picked off individually in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The NCAA hasn't helped its members. The NCAA right now, without anything 
substantial on the agenda, is saying to its members, 'Hey, we'll let you get 
picked off.' " 
</P>
<P>
 According to Hansen, who served on the task force, the panel did the best it 
could under the circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Donna is ignoring some of the other things that were done, including a very 
significant expansion of NCAA championship opportunities for women," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Plus, one of the things we decided was, it was not for the NCAA to insist 
that institutions comply with federal law, which could be a moving target. What 
we were doing was trying to create more of a philosophical commitment for 
equity, not make rigid rules." 
</P>
<P>
 The convention legislation concerning finances is also limited in scope. The 
legislation includes proposals that would eliminate the position of recruiting 
coordinator in Division I-A and I-AA football, cut back recruiting calendars in 
football and basketball, and limit the number of players who can participate in 
preseason football practice at Division I-A schools. Convention at a Glance 
</P>
<P>
 Key proposals on the agenda at the 88th annual NCAA convention would: * 
Establish a principle of gender equity among the association's guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 * Establish nine "emerging sports" for women: archery, badminton, bowling, 
crew, ice hockey, squash, synchronized swimming, team handball and water polo. 
</P>
<P>
 * Specify that a Division I-A football program cannot employ an individual 
apart from its coaching staff whose sole duties are that of recruiting 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cap at 105 the number of players who can participate in preseason football 
practice in Division I-A. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cut scholarships in Division I-AA football. 
</P>
<P>
 * Increase the scholarship limit in Division I men's basketball from 13 to 14. 
</P>
<P>
 * Preclude the use of correspondence courses by student-athletes for 
satisfying eligibility requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 * Give college basketball players one chance to declare for the NBA draft 
during their college careers without losing eligibility as long as they choose 
to remain in school within 30 days of the draft. 
</P>
<P>
 * Permit athletes in Divisions I and II to have five seasons of eligibility 
(instead of four) and eliminate the practice of "red-shirting." 
</P>
<P>
 * Direct appropriate NCAA committees to review legislation, enacted in 1992 
and due to take effect in 1995, that would increase academic requirements for 
prospective student-athletes.

ROCKETS' MAXWELL LEAVES HOSPITAL, WILL SIT OUT AT LEAST TWO GAMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Guard Vernon Maxwell of the Houston Rockets, hospitalized for treatment of an 
irregular heartbeat, is out of the hospital but will have to sit out at least 
two games, the team said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell left Methodist Hospital on Friday night, a day after he checked 
himself into the facility because of what the Rockets called an episode of 
atrial fibrillation. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell was given medication Friday and his heart rate returned to normal by 
the afternoon, according to team physicians. However, he sat out Saturday 
night's game in Houston against Philadelphia and will not accompany the team to 
Orlando for Monday night's game, the Rockets said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teammates said Maxwell had complained of a rapid heartbeat since he suffered a 
chest bruise Dec. 23 against Denver.

<P>
 Harvey Haddix, remembered for pitching 12 perfect innings in a game that he 
eventually lost, died Saturday at 68. 
</P>
<P>
 Haddix, who had a record of 136-113 while pitching for the Cardinals, 
Phillies, Reds, Pirates and Orioles from 1952-65, died of emphysema in 
Springfield, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 While pitching for the Pittsburgh Pirates on May 26, 1959, he retired the 
first 36 Milwaukee Braves he faced. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bottom of the 13th, the Braves' Felix Mantilla reached base on an error 
and moved to second on a sacrifice by Eddie Mathews. After Henry Aaron was 
walked intentionally, Joe Adcock homered. 
</P>
<P>
 The score was officially listed as 1-0 because Adcock inadvertently passed 
Aaron on the base path, advancing to second before heading across the diamond 
to the dugout.

UNINSPIRED ANTEATERS FALL; BASKETBALL: AFTER TWO BIG VICTORIES, IRVINE LOSES TO 
CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE, 68-66. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Riding a wave of emotion during victories over Iowa and Cal State Fullerton, 
UC Irvine staggered and crashed to an uninspired defeat while attempting to 
make it three in a row Saturday night. The Anteaters lost, 68-66, to Cal State 
Northridge (3-10) in front of 2,167 in the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a game that started ugly -- it was 2-1 after the first 4 1/2 minutes -- 
and finished even uglier. Irvine had a chance to send the game into overtime in 
the final second when Joe Hannon, starting in place of injured center DeForrest 
Boyer, rebounded a miss by Zuri Williams and instead of dumping it in the 
basket, turned and threw a pass out to the perimeter as the buzzer sounded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we were down by three instead of two," Hannon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, as Matador Coach Pete Cassidy was quick to point out, it was hard to 
lay the blame solely on Hannon. And Irvine Coach Rod Baker said he wasn't sure 
if "it was a case of both teams wanting it too badly or neither team wanting it 
at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams took turns during a stretch-time slop-fest that degenerated into an 
almost humorous exchange of you-take-it-no-you-take-it basketball. During a 
two-minute stretch between 3:17 remaining and 1:22, the Anteaters and Matadors 
combined to turn over the ball on five consecutive possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge took a 68-64 lead with 19.6 seconds left when Andre Chevalier made 
two free throws. Khalid Channell, the only Anteater in double figures (16 
points), put in a follow shot to cut the deficit to two points. Then Brooklyn 
McLinn, who led Northridge with 18 points, missed two free throws with eight 
seconds remaining, giving the Anteaters an opening. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who was playing in his first game after a two-game suspension 
because of a shoplifting citation, was also playing in his 40th minute at point 
guard when he drove the length of the floor and missed a flying layup. Point 
guard Lloyd Mumford, who is nursing an ankle sprain, was watching from the 
bench in his street clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hannon grabbed the rebound and had a clear path for an easy dunk or layup, but 
spun and threw away the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We called timeout (before McLinn's free throws) and went over what we wanted 
to do if we were two points or three points or four points down," Baker said, 
"but sometimes in the heat of the moment, you don't always do the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Joe will make that same mistake again, though." 
</P>
<P>
 With Williams and guard Todd Whitehead suspended, the Anteaters had pulled 
together to pull off the two victories. Baker, who had said earlier in the week 
the pair would also miss Saturday night's game, changed his mind, although he 
said the injuries to Mumford and Boyer were not the deciding factor. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case -- if they can stay on the right side of the law and outside the 
training room -- it seems the Anteaters are on the verge of developing into a 
pretty decent team. Somebody always seems ready to pick up the slack, even 
though Irvine couldn't make it a sweep of Northridge. They beat the Matadors, 
93-82, on Dec. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge, which snapped a 12-game road losing streak, led by six (50-44) 
midway through the second half when Channell, a junior forward, took charge. He 
scored 11 of his points in the final 9:54 and when he made one of two free 
throws with 3:39 left, the Matadors led by a point, 64-63. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when both sides lapsed into turnover mode. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevalier threw a pass out of bounds. Irvine's Mark Odsather forced a pass 
inside that never made it to a teammate. Channell blocked a weak layup attempt 
by McLinn and then Whitehead dribbled the ball off his foot and out of bounds. 
Northridge's Peter Micelli was called for traveling. And so it went. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess they caught some breaks and we didn't, but that's a good team," Baker 
said. "But when you go four of 20 on three-pointers, shoot that (.426) from the 
field and only 52% from the line, you ain't gonna beat anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Chris Brown, who was 12 of 25 from three-point range and scored 44 
points in the last two games, made only two of nine three-point attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put it on with Brown," said McLinn, assessing his defensive prowess. "I ate 
him alive. I was oblivious to the ball, I just stayed on him all night." 
</P>
<P>
 It was an all-around deflating night for the Anteaters, who tumbled rudely out 
of the comfort zone they had found in the past nine days. 
</P>
<P>
 "This brings you back to earth, but that's fine," Baker said. "That's fine. Of 
course I'm reaching, reaching real bad."

VIKINGS NOT WHAT DOCTOR ORDERED FOR AILING GIANTS; PRO FOOTBALL: NEW YORK IS 
SLIDING AFTER LOSING TO THE COWBOYS AND INJURIES TO KEY PLAYERS. MCMAHON-LED 
MINNESOTA IS ON THE UPSWING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been but a week since the New York Giants spent five quarters fighting 
against the best team in football. 
</P>
<P>
 They since have lost their best offensive lineman, probably their best 
defensive back and a few steps off the swagger that carried them through a 
dream season. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be understatement to say that the Minnesota Vikings are the last 
thing they need to see. 
</P>
<P>
 But here the Vikings are, with a renewed Jim McMahon and an inspired defense, 
walking into Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., today for a first-round 
playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
 Rarely has a postseason event featured teams going in such different 
directions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Vikings, 6-7 last month, are thrilled to be here. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants hate being here. But they lost to the Dallas Cowboys in an overtime 
thriller last week for the NFC East championship. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Vikings won their last three games and four of their last five, beating 
playoff-bound Detroit, Green Bay and Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants lost their last two games and have not beaten a playoff team all 
season. They are 1-3 against teams with better than .500 records. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Vikings have the top-ranked defense in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants have the league's fifth-ranked defense, but lately they have been 
hammered by the run. 
</P>
<P>
 Emmitt Smith gained 168 yards against them last Sunday. A week earlier, Ron 
Moore of the Phoenix Cardinals gained 135. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Vikings have a streaking running back, Scottie Graham, who began 
December without having carried the ball and ended the month as the Vikings' 
leading rusher. He is averaging 105 yards in four games since becoming the 
starter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants have Rodney Hampton, who has gained more than 78 yards in only two 
of eight games since recovering from knee and ankle injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key to the playoffs is what kind of momentum you are building, what kind 
of energy you are generating," said Bart Oates, the Giants' veteran center. "At 
this stage, everyone is tired, everyone is beat up. The winning team is the 
team that has something going in their locker room." 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants, under Dan Reeves, voted coach of the year last week, had that 
something going earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Refreshed by the switch to Reeves from overmatched Ray Handley and excited 
about playing for quarterback Phil Simms again, the Giants won five of their 
first six games and led the NFC East until the final Sunday of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 But their youth -- only 18 players have playoff experience -- and injuries 
finally appear to be hurting them. 
</P>
<P>
 They have not had a consistently good target for Simms since Mike Sherrard was 
injured in the sixth game. 
</P>
<P>
 And now they won't have a good blocker to watch Simms' blind side, because 
tackle Jumbo Elliott has been sidelined because of a bad back after having been 
beaten several times by the Cowboys last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 They also might not have cornerback Mark Collins, who tied for the team lead 
with four interceptions. Collins suffered a sprained knee in practice Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Their concentration appears to be wavering, which was addressed by Reeves 
earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time you get to the playoffs, every team is really good. At this 
level, things have to be done exactly right. Techniques have to be perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of perfect, that nearly describes the last three games for McMahon, 
who had a 101.1 quarterback rating in that span while completing an 8-3 season 
as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
 McMahon is 40-15 against NFC teams, excluding the Vikings, with 15 victories 
in his last 19 starts against conference opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite earlier criticism, he has been a strong leader for a team with 37 
players who have playoff experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the one advantage we have that a lot of people are overlooking," 
linebacker Jack Del Rio said of McMahon. "He has been there before. He does not 
push the panic button." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither does Simms. But by the end of this afternoon, he might not have a 
choice.

SPEEDSKATING / U.S. OLYMPIC TRIALS; QUESTIONS REMAIN IN THE DISTANCE EVENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 In his final race at the U.S. Olympic long track speed skating trials, Dan 
Jansen tied a track record in the 500-meter sprint. No surprise there, because 
he merely matched the time of 36.30 seconds he raced last weekend at the Pettit 
National Ice Center. Nor was it a surprise that Bonnie Blair won the ladies' 
500, in which she holds the world record. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the expected became reality in the 500-meter sprint, uncertainty 
persists over whether any Americans will qualify for the Lillehammer Games in 
the distance events. 
</P>
<P>
 The field for the women's 3,000 and men's 5,000 will be limited to the fastest 
32 times in the world, with a maximum of three skaters per country. The women's 
5,000 and men's 10,000 each will be limited to 16 entrants based on times in 
the women's 3,000 and men's 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Chantal Bailey of Boulder, Colo., who qualified in the 1,500, won the second 
and last staging of the 3,000 Saturday in a time of 4:33.30. Bailey, who won 
the first 3,000 last week, finished first overall ahead of 16-year-old Chris 
Scheels of New Berlin, Wis., and Angela Zuckerman of Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 The men's 5,000 was again won by in-line racer KC Boutiette of Tacoma, Wash. 
Even though he improved his time by 1.47 seconds from last weekend to 7:05.96, 
he's still far off the estimated Olympic cutoff time of 6:55. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the 5,000, it's looking pretty sketchy right now," said Nick Thometz, one 
of the national team coaches. "We might not have anybody in the 10,000. . . . 
At the World Cup (meet) in Hamar (Norway, last month), there weren't even 32 in 
the 3,000. Chantal, Chris and Angela should all qualify." 
</P>
<P>
 Jansen will skip today's final 1,000-meter race so he can rest. Competitors 
are allowed to drop the worst of their three times in that event. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any snap in my legs at the moment," he said. "A lot of it is 
motivation. There's nobody really here to push me to skate under 36." 
</P>
<P>
 David Cruikshank of Northbrook, Ill., was second overall in the 500 and made 
his third Olympic team. Nathaniel Mills of Evanston, Ill., made the team for 
the third time and David Besteman of Madison, Wis., for the second time in long 
track. Besteman also made the 1988 short-track team. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Blair in qualifying for the women's 500 were Peggy Clasen of 
Roseville, Minn., Michelle Kline of Wauwatosa, Wis., and Kristen Talbot of 
Schuylerville, N.Y. Talbot is scheduled to enter Johns Hopkins Hospital in 
Baltimore on Monday to donate bone marrow to her brother, who has aplastic 
anemia.

AWARDING OF FINAL PAIRS BERTH CREATES FUROR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jenni Meno and Todd Sand of Costa Mesa, who competed in the 1992 Winter 
Olympics with different partners, will be going to the 1994 Games together 
after winning the pairs competition Saturday in the U.S. Figure Skating 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 But two other 1992 Olympians, Natasha Kuchiki of Canoga Park and Rocky Marval 
of New Egypt, N.J., missed out on one of three pairs berths the United States 
will have in Norway by finishing fourth in a decision that was loudly booed by 
the crowd of 9,492 at Joe Louis Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no argument with the scores awarded by the nine judges to Meno and 
Sand or the runners-up, Kyoko Ina and Jason Dungjen of Monsey, N.Y., but 
third-place Karen Courtland and Toddy Reynolds of Newark, Del., had three falls 
in their freestyle program. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuchiki and Marval, who train together in Monsey, N.Y., made no major errors, 
but they might have lost the 5-4 decision by the judges because their program 
was not technically difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 They have been together only four months. Marval's former partner, Calla 
Urbanski, left him last summer. Kuchiki split with her former partner, Sand, in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In their first season together in 1993, Meno and Sand finished second in the 
national championships and fifth in the world. He skated last week with a black 
eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "Detroit's a tough town," he said. "But you should have seen the other guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Meno was the other guy, and she looked fine. She accidentally 
elbowed Sand in the right eye during a practice. RANDY HARVEY

WEST COAST CONFERENCE BASKETBALL PREVIEW; A MATCHED PAIR HOLDS ALL THE CARDS; 
PEPPERDINE, SANTA CLARA ARE RATED EVEN FAVORITES TO WIN TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MITCH POLIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Will it be Pepperdine and Santa Clara? 
</P>
<P>
 Or Santa Clara and Pepperdine? 
</P>
<P>
 As the West Coast Conference basketball season gets under way, there is little 
consensus among conference coaches on which team will finish first. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a few rocky outings for both teams in nonconference play, though, most 
coaches agree they are the top two teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are the co-favorites and it's hard to choose between them," Loyola 
Marymount Coach John Olive said. "Santa Clara is probably a little more of a 
finesse team and Pepperdine is a little more of a power team. But Pepperdine 
also has a tremendous perimeter player in (guard Damin) Lopez." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the season, many conference observers expected Santa Clara to ride its 
momentum from last season to the title. The Broncos went on a tear after the 
regular season, winning the WCC Tournament and shocking highly regarded Arizona 
in the first round of the NCAA playoffs before being eliminated by Temple and 
finishing 19-12. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the Broncos have struggled a little more than expected since the start of 
the season, while Pepperdine appears to be gaining momentum as conference play 
approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The Waves, who have won three consecutive regular-season titles, left an 
impression on Coach Jeff Mullins of North Carolina Charlotte -- the only school 
that has played both teams. Pepperdine defeated the 49ers by 11 points last 
week in Malibu after they lost to Santa Clara by two points the previous week 
at Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'd have to give Pepperdine the edge," said Mullins, a former star 
with the Golden State Warriors. "They're both outstanding teams. But when I 
think of Pepperdine, I think of their three good scorers and I think of the 
passing of (point guard) Bryan Parker." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clara Coach Dick Davey was quick to agree with the assessment of 
Mullins. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the league in general is very well-balanced and I think anyone can 
truly beat anyone on a given night," he said. "But I think right now Pepperdine 
is the best team in the conference, and I think they'd have to be the favorite. 
We played a little better early on, but we haven't played as well lately and 
they're playing very well, and that's what counts." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury didn't want to leap at the 
opportunity to assume the role of WCC favorite. In fact, he said, it could be 
one of the most wide-open races in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to be tougher than it's been," Asbury said. "It's as 
balanced as it's ever been." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Waves and Santa Clara seem to be a step ahead, teams such as 
Gonzaga, San Francisco and San Diego have played well in nonconference games 
and will not make it easy for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The words are balance and parity, and those are words I don't like to hear," 
Asbury said. "I like it better when we have seven teams looking up at us. I've 
never been a fan of balance." 
</P>
<P>
 This season, he will probably have to get used to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola and Pepperdine open conference play Friday at home against St. Mary's 
and Santa Clara, respectively. The local teams switch opponents Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a team-by-team look at the WCC. Records are in parentheses: LOYOLA 
(1-9) 
</P>
<P>
 It would be difficult to judge by his team's record, but Olive thinks the 
Lions can be competitive in a well-balanced conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're improving," Olive said. "We're not making as many mistakes as 
we were earlier in the season and I think we're going to be OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola's chances were not helped when senior forward Zan Mason, the team's 
second-leading scorer and rebounder, suffered a possible season-ending knee 
injury against Texas A & M on Dec. 30. The Lions have also lost promising 
freshman forward Michael O'Quinn, who has been ruled academically ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
 Without Mason and O'Quinn, the Lions will rely even more heavily on forward 
Wyking Jones. The junior from St. Bernard High leads Loyola, averaging 17.3 
points and 6.7 rebounds. Senior guard Bill Mazurie (10.7) is the only other 
Lion with a double-digit scoring average. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola has not won a conference game since Jan. 30 of last year, when it 
defeated St. Mary's 59-55 at Gersten Pavilion. The Lions also rank last among 
conference teams in several important categories including defense, rebound 
margin, scoring margin and turnover margin. PEPPERDINE (8-4) 
</P>
<P>
 After surviving a difficult nonconference schedule, including losses to highly 
regarded teams such as No. 23 George Washington and Iowa State, the Waves 
appear primed for a run at another regular-season title. 
</P>
<P>
 Asbury likes his team's chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "This team can play a good level of basketball, we're fairly deep and I think 
we're almost there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Waves haven't been scoring as much as last season, when they went 
23-8 and reached the second round of the National Invitation Tournament, they 
are ranked first in the conference in defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The top players are senior forward Dana Jones, the conference player of the 
year last season and who now averages 16.7 points and a conference-leading 10.2 
rebounds, and senior guard Damin Lopez, who averages 15.6 points. They have had 
help offensively from forward Derek Noether, who has improved his average to 
11.5 points after a slow start. 
</P>
<P>
 The big question at the start of the season was who would be the team's fifth 
starter along with four seniors. But 6-11 sophomore center Gavin Vanderputten 
seems to have filled the void. SANTA CLARA (7-5) 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos had high aspirations following their success of last season, not 
to mention the return of most of their top players. But Davey is hoping his 
team can finish faster than it has started. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have higher expectations after having a reasonable amount of success, and 
we're not living up to the expectations," Davey said. "Hopefully we'll get 
better as we go along." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clara faced a difficult schedule early in the season, losing to 
nationally ranked Arizona and California. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos have been slowed more recently by the loss of guard Steve Nash and 
forward Kevin Dunne to ankle injuries. Nash, prolific from three-point range, 
is the team's leading scorer (14.9-point average) and Dunne is fourth in 
scoring and second in rebounding. Both are expected back for the start of 
conference play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos have also received reliable inside play from forwards Pete 
Eisenrich and DeWayne Lewis, who both average about 12 points, and point guard 
John Woolery, who leads the conference with an average of 8.1 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Davey said patience might be the best coaching virtue at this point. "You've 
got to assume that you're as good as everyone thinks you are, so the key is 
getting to the conference tournament and executing well when you get there." 
SAN FRANCISCO (8-3) 
</P>
<P>
 If either Santa Clara or Pepperdine should falter, the Dons could be in the 
best position to take the conference title. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco has yet to win a WCC title since it reinstated its basketball 
program in 1985, although it was the most improved team in the conference last 
season at 19-12. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons have yet to defeat a highly regarded opponent, and have lost to 
national powers Kentucky and Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
 But with four starters returning, including senior Orlando Smart, perhaps the 
best point guard in the conference, the Dons have abundant experience. "We have 
a shot at going all the way in conference, but so do at least four other 
teams," Coach Jim Brovelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smart, who was named WCC player of the month for December, is third in the 
conference in scoring at 17.6 and second in assists at 7.7. He is the 
conference's all-time leader in assists with 775. The Dons also have two other 
solid offensive players in senior forward Kent Bennett, a former Harbor College 
star, and sophomore guard Gerald Walker. GONZAGA (8-4) 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs have come close to winning their first conference title the past 
two seasons, and they've given notice that they will be a factor again under 
longtime coach Dan Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzaga has reeled off seven wins in a row, all at home, and has won 19 
consecutive home games since February, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 It also has one of the most experienced teams in the WCC; four starters return 
from a 19-9 squad, including all-conference senior forward Jeff Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs also have the best shooting team in the conference. They are 
first in field goals (52.4%), free throws (72.4%) and three-point baskets 
(40.4%). 
</P>
<P>
 Their top shooters are Brown, who leads the WCC with a 21-point average and is 
third in field goals at 59.6%, and guard John Rillie, who is second in 
three-point shooting at 50.9%. Brown, 6-9 and 240 pounds, also led the WCC in 
scoring last season. SAN DIEGO (8-3) 
</P>
<P>
 It has been an about-face for the Toreros, who dropped six of their first nine 
games last season en route to a 13-14 record -- their first losing season since 
1988-89. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference so far has been San Diego's defense, which has given up an 
average of 67.8 points. San Diego opponents have made only 38.4% of their field 
goals, best in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 That should keep the Toreros in contention in most of their conference games 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also the experience factor, starting with Coach Hank Egan. He has 
been a head coach for 23 years, the first 13 at the Air Force Academy. The 
Toreros also have most of their top players back from last season, including 
four starters. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders are guards Doug Harris and Joe Temple. Harris, an outstanding 
outside shooter, made a conference-leading 47.4% of his three-point shots last 
season. The team's top inside player is senior 6-9 center Brooks Barnhard. ST. 
MARY'S (6-4) 
</P>
<P>
 Much the opposite of San Diego, the Gaels have not had a winning season since 
they captured the 1988-89 conference title. 
</P>
<P>
 They have lost three of their past four games, including a 94-77 setback to 
California on Jan. 2, but still appear markedly improved from last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the biggest factor has been the team's shooting accuracy. The Gaels 
rank second in the conference in field goals at 48.9% and second in three-point 
field goals at 39.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gaels have also displayed unexpected depth; 11 players average at least 
four points, topped by guard Chris Johnson (14.3) and forward A. J. Rollins 
(13). Their reserves are averaging 31.3 points, best in the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 That helps explain how the Gaels are averaging 83.2 points, third in the WCC 
and nearly 22 points more than they averaged last season. PORTLAND (7-8) 
</P>
<P>
 The Pilots started the season with a flourish, winning six of their first nine 
games and reaching the final of the Great Alaska Shootout. 
</P>
<P>
 The early success was largely attributable to the addition of junior guards 
Canaan Chatman and Ray Ross, who both played at Oregon State as freshmen. 
Chatman played at Portland Community College last season and Ross at College of 
Southern Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
 But lately, Portland has been struggling like a team that hasn't finished with 
a winning record since the 1981-82 season. The Pilots have lost five in a row, 
not the best way to head into conference play. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, they are the only team in the conference that has four starters 
averaging in double-figure scoring. The leader is Chatman, a 6-8 swingman who 
averages 16.2 points and 7.7 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland should show improvement with the return of point guard Jerry Allen, 
who has been out with a broken hand but is expected back for the team's WCC 
opener Friday against San Francisco. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Two Loyola players lead the conference in individual categories. Wyking Jones 
is first in field-goal shooting at 62% and Bill Mazurie is first from the 
free-throw line, having made 28 of 30 attempts for 93.3%. . . . St. Mary's has 
two former South Bay players in its starting lineup. They are senior forward 
Martell Bland (6-3), who played at Morningside High, and senior guard Darrell 
Daniel (6-1) from Bishop Montgomery. Daniel averages 9.5 points and Bland 6.8. 
. . . Following its nonconference win over Cal State Hayward on Tuesday, Santa 
Clara will have 10 days off before its WCC opener at Pepperdine. . . . San 
Francisco's Orlando Smart needs only four assists to move into the NCAA 
all-time top 20. He is on a pace to finish in the top 10. . . . Gonzaga's Jeff 
Brown was named WCC player of the week, averaging 26.5 points and making 65.4% 
of his shots to lead the Bulldogs to the title of the four-team Spokane 
Shootout.

FROM A HUMBLE START, HE BECAME ZEUS; TRACK: TOMMIE LISTER JR. WAS AN ORDINARY 
ATHLETE AT COMPTON HIGH WHO WENT ON TO WIN A SHOTPUT TITLE AT CAL STATE L.A. HE 
THEN BECAME A WELL-KNOWN PRO WRESTLER AND NOW IS A SUCCESSFUL ACTOR. 
</P>

<P>
 Tommie Lister Jr. no doubt is remembered by professional wrestling fans as 
Zeus, a homicidal maniac who challenged Hulk Hogan to a match with no rules in 
the 1989 film "No Holds Barred." 
</P>
<P>
 He wrestled in "Summer Slam" that year. Lister also joined "Macho Man" Randy 
Savage in a tag-team match against Hogan and Brutus "The Barber" Beefcake in a 
pay-per-view special. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-5, 275-pound Lister dropped out of the World Wrestling Federation 
scene afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Lister sold his Harbor City home to move to Atlanta in 1990, the new 
homeowner asked him not to remove the name Zeus, which had been painted on the 
bottom of the swimming pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Lister, 35, who has adopted the nickname "Tiny," has since surfaced in a roles 
in movies and television. 
</P>
<P>
 Some might think Lister is just another athlete turned actor, and that the 
theatrical escapades of professional wrestling aren't much different from 
big-screen shoot-'em-ups. But Lister's road to success didn't start with the 
WWF. 
</P>
<P>
 Lister, who has been blind in his right eye since birth, was the NCAA Division 
II shotput champion at Cal State Los Angeles, where he still holds the school 
record of 61 feet, 8 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Track and field will always be my first love," Lister said. "Winning the 
national championship means more to me than anything I have or will do. It was 
my first claim to success." 
</P>
<P>
 Lister improved to 64-3 in 1983, competing for the Converse Track Club, but 
gave up track in 1984 to try his hand in football with the New Orleans Breakers 
of the now-defunct United States Football League. 
</P>
<P>
 In the interim, Lister, a business major, began receiving small roles in 
commercials through contacts with agents he met while working as a bouncer in a 
nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, it was Bubba Smith. Then came the Mr. T era," Lister said. "I was the 
next one to come along. My eye made me distinctive and became my trademark. I 
went to an audition and got the part. Then I kept going and going and getting 
the parts." 
</P>
<P>
 The Breakers cut Lister, who had no previous organized football experience, 
after two exhibition games but offered him a spot on the practice squad. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Lister opted for acting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who needed football and getting beat up?," Lister said. "I made $100,000 my 
first year making movies without getting hurt. With the little common sense I 
had left, I figured it would make sense to become an actor." 
</P>
<P>
 Lister is now a veteran of 21 films. He was a regular on the HBO series "1st & 
Ten," and has been a guest star on "Webster," "Matlock" and the "Fresh Prince 
of Bel-Air." He also had a cameo role with Eddie Murphy on Michael Jackson's 
music video "Remember the Time." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Lister co-starred with Mario Van Peebles and Tone Loc in the Western 
"Posse." In "Men at War," which recently finished filming in Thailand and is 
scheduled for a fall release, Lister plays an evil mercenary named Blades. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you think Zeus was bad, Blades is like his twin brother, but twice as 
bad," Lister said. "The kids are going to love it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lister's athletic career, however, didn't blossom as quickly as his career as 
a thespian. 
</P>
<P>
 He competed in track for three seasons at Compton High, but never won a league 
championship or advanced to the Southern Section finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Lister, who weighed 250 pounds during his shotputting days, attended Palomar 
Junior College for a year but did not qualify for postseason competition. He 
transferred to Long Beach College for his sophomore year in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was so huge we called him Tommie Hulk," said Virgil Torrence, 34, a 
sprinter and roommate of Lister at Long Beach. "He could growl and do 
imitations. He is really friendly and easygoing, but he can be almost 
intimidating when he is goofing around. He always had a little acting ability." 
</P>
<P>
 At Long Beach, Lister also showed his first signs of athletic promise, 
recording a mark of 52-0 in the shotput. He qualified for the Southern 
California finals and earned a scholarship to Cal State L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 He increased his best to 53-9 his junior year at Cal State L.A. He finished 
sixth in the California College Athletic Assn. championships but was plagued by 
a mysterious weight loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Lister, who had dropped 30 pounds, was diagnosed with kidney stones and 
infected tonsils. He had surgery and was hospitalized for three weeks, forcing 
him to sit out the 1981 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always a milk freak and developed calcium deposits in my bladder 
because I never drank any water," Lister said. "When I got well, I knew I was 
going to break the school record." 
</P>
<P>
 He did that -- breaking the old standard by nearly six feet and winning a 
national title -- and is the only Cal State L.A. shotputter ever to break 60 
feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was only a matter of time before he reached that kind of level," Long 
Beach Coach Ron Allice said. "When he came to Long Beach, he was a real novice 
and that was his first real year of throwing. His potential was untapped." 
</P>
<P>
 Lister also concedes that his fascination with Westerns wasn't conducive to 
top performances on the track. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a TV fanatic. I was always late to practice because I was watching 'The 
Rifleman' and 'Bonanza,' " Lister said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lister said he still watches movies most nights well past midnight. But he 
also finds time to give motivational talks to youth groups in Georgia with his 
close friend, Deion Sanders of Atlanta Braves and Atlanta Falcons. He also 
visits Allice to give motivational talks to the Long Beach track team. 
</P>
<P>
 Lister said he yearns to return to Cal State L.A. someday to teach drama or 
coach track. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was nothing. Everything started there," Lister said. "I got my first big 
break for exposure because people there believed in me and gave me a chance to 
develop. I would love to wear a Cal State L.A. jacket wherever I go around the 
world. I'm just a big a kid who got lucky beyond his wildest dreams, but I am 
very, very proud of where I'm from."

HIGH SCHOOLS / JASON H. REID: WELCH WORKED MEDIA THE WAY HE DID HIS TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harry Welch's mixed legacy as Canyon High football coach included everything 
from three Southern Section championships to a two-year legal battle against 
the Southern Section. 
</P>
<P>
 Like him or not, Welch, who resigned Monday after 12 years, was impossible to 
ignore. 
</P>
<P>
 Welch also will be remembered because he was a master at dealing with the 
media. No coach in the region had more written about him, good or bad. 
</P>
<P>
 Three stories about his career appeared in The Times in the days after his 
resignation. (Actually, four, including this one.) 
</P>
<P>
 Some college and professional coaches do not have that many stories written 
about them in their careers , let alone one week. He was big news in this 
region and was treated accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 More than anything he accomplished, or the problems he encountered, Welch knew 
what reporters wanted and how to have it appear in print -- the way he wanted 
for the most part. 
</P>
<P>
 Welch is an engaging, erudite individual who often motivated reporters to put 
his "spin" on stories much in the manner he motivated his players to battle 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 He dealt with reporters on a personal level, something the majority of his 
colleagues would never attempt. Welch returned phone calls promptly, was quick 
to offer good quotes and made himself and his team available. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, he did not run for cover when "negative" stories appeared. Welch 
understood you have to take the good with the bad, something else many of his 
colleagues should learn. 
</P>
<P>
 Some reporters believe Welch is a sycophant who simply craved media attention. 
Not true. 
</P>
<P>
 Welch liked the attention he and his team received, and he used his 
personality to win over the media. Reporters in the region used Welch to get 
the stories they wanted for their newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Who got the better of whom? That is open to debate. 
</P>
<P>
 This much is certain: Working on a story concerning Welch was never dull. 
</P>

 Bumps and bruises: Jason Hartman, Thousand Oaks standout senior forward, 
probably will miss the Lancers' Marmonte League home game against Channel 
Islands on Monday night after suffering a hyper-extended neck against Westlake 
on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had to guess right now, I probably won't play (Monday night)," Hartman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartman, who has committed to Washington, suffered the injury with 18 seconds 
remaining in the Lancers' 57-52 loss at Westlake. Hartman dove to the floor in 
pursuit of a loose ball and a Westlake player fell on him, forcing his head to 
the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 He lay motionless on the court for a few minutes before walking off under his 
own power and applying an ice pack to the back of his neck. As a precautionary 
measure, Hartman was transported on a stretcher to an ambulance and taken to 
Los Robles Regional Medical Center in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartman was released from the hospital at 12:30 a.m. after X-rays revealed no 
broken bones. He is wearing a neck brace and undergoing physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Late-night practice: Hartman wasn't the only Lancer who had a late night. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks Coach Ed Chevalier was so disappointed with his team's play in 
the fourth quarter against Westlake that he conducted a practice after the 
game. The Lancers hit the gym to shoot free throws as soon as they stepped off 
the team bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had them shoot because we just didn't do a good job late in the game," said 
Chevalier, whose team made one of six free throws in the fourth quarter and 
blew a lead for the second game in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss dropped the three-time defending league champion Lancers to 9-5, 0-2 
in league play. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is definitely a sense of some urgency now," Chevalier said. "Our 
players need to step up in the fourth quarter." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unity when it counts: Reseda basketball Coach Jeff Halpern stopped practice 
for 30 minutes Thursday to diffuse arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that some players have been taking more shots in games than teammates 
believe are necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ego thing has been my biggest concern this season," Halpern said. "I sat 
the kids down and tried to clear the air. I just hoped that would work." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure did: Reseda (13-0) defeated Chatsworth, 72-63. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 No more No. 35: Buena football Coach Rick Scott has retired jersey No. 35, the 
number worn by senior running back George Keiaho. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's never been done before at Buena as far as I know," Scott said. "We put 
it in a frame and gave it to his mom. She was really surprised." 
</P>
<P>
 Keiaho, a four-year starter, is the state's second all-time leading rusher 
with 6,585 yards. He scored 80 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Although George is leaving, another Keiaho will arrive at Buena next year: 
Roger, George's younger brother. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger, 14, will be a freshman at Buena. He is 5-foot-10 and 165 pounds -- and 
a football player.

AMERICAN FIGURE-SKATING JUDGES GAVE THEMSELVES A BLACK EYE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Figure-skating judges in the United States have become recognized in recent 
years as the world's fairest, overcoming the perception that they determined 
the winners and losers long before the skaters laced on their boots. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, they gave Scott Davis the men's title he earned last week in the 
U.S. Figure Skating Championships instead of merely presiding over a coronation 
for the presumed winner, Brian Boitano. 
</P>
<P>
 But five of the nine judges assigned to the pairs competition Saturday in the 
U.S. Figure Skating Championships reverted to their old sleight-of-hand tricks, 
playing a game with the 9,492 spectators at Joe Louis Arena of, "Do you believe 
us or your lying eyes?" 
</P>
<P>
 There was no real debate about their decision that Jenni Meno and Todd Sand of 
Costa Mesa deserved first place ahead of runners-up Kyoko Ina and Jason Dungjen 
of Monsey, N.Y., although an argument can be made that the latter challenged 
themselves more technically. 
</P>
<P>
 It was as obvious, however, as Sand's black eye that third place should have 
been awarded to Natasha Kuchiki of Canoga Park and Rocky Marval of New Egypt, 
N.J., who train together in Monsey, N.Y., instead of Karen Courtland and Todd 
Reynolds of Newark, Del. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the controversial scoring, Courtland and Reynolds earned the 
third and last berth for the U.S. pairs team in next month's Winter Olympics in 
Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 The spectators booed when it became obvious Kuchiki and Marval had been 
underscored. Not all of them would have been able to define what makes one 
performance better than another, but, like obscenity, they know it when they 
see it. 
</P>
<P>
 Courtland and Reynolds have been together for 2 1/2 years, so it is natural 
that the freestyle program they performed Saturday was both more refined and 
demanding than the one skated by Kuchiki and Marval, who have been together for 
four months. But the difference was that Kuchiki and Marval did what they 
planned with no major mistakes, while Courtland and Reynolds had three falls. 
Reynolds skated the final minute with so much ice on his back that he looked 
like Omar Sharif in "Dr. Zhivago." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, five judges gave Courtland and Reynolds better scores than 
Kuchiki and Marval. 
</P>
<P>
 Because judges do not discuss their duties with reporters, one can only assume 
they believed Courtland and Reynolds would make better use of the Olympic 
berth. So they gave it to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like pro wrestling," said Michael Rosenberg, the agent for Kuchiki and 
Marval. "That's not saying anything bad about Courtland and Reynolds because 
they're as nice as any people you'll ever meet. But they were outskated, and 
everyone in the arena saw it. It was disgraceful." 
</P>
<P>
 Marval, who won the national championship in 1992 and '93 with Calla Urbanski, 
was diplomatic with reporters before he finally allowed his frustration to 
surface. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what I understand, we were counted out from the beginning because of our 
previous performance," he said of their fourth-place finish in a qualifying 
competition. "I don't think it was fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuchiki, 17, the 1991 national champion with Sand, seemed resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judges will do what they want to do," she said. "I'm not really worried 
about that." 
</P>
<P>
 In only their second season together, Meno and Sand, a native of Thousand 
Oaks, have developed as one of the world's best pairs. They finished fifth in 
last year's World Championships. Both skated in the 1992 Winter Olympics with 
other partners. 
</P>
<P>
 Sand performed with a shiner over his right eye suffered when Meno elbowed him 
during a practice last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Sand will recover from the black eye Meno gave him. It will take longer for 
the sport to recover from the one it gave itself.

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EASTSIDE; STAYING IN BUSINESS IN TOUGH TIMES

<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Economic Development Department and the East Los Angeles Chamber of 
Commerce have scheduled a Jan. 21 summit for local businesses on surviving and 
thriving in a difficult economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The summit is designed to help merchants take advantage of tax breaks, 
employee-training programs and information that they may not know about, said 
Victor Robles, one of the event's organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are not aware of all the things that our government dollars -- taxes 
-- offer, such as training programs and tax incentives," Robles said.  
</P>
<P>
 In the seven years that he and his wife, Yolanda, have run their contracting 
company, they have discovered low-interest, small-business loans and tax 
deductions by being located in a revitalization zone. And most of their 
employees have been hired through on-the-job training programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took us a long time to find out how to get certified as a minority-owned 
business to compete for big projects," Robles said. 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of knowledge can help businesses save money or expand their markets, 
said Sandy Gutierrez, manager of the state Economic Development Department 
office in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oftentimes, businesses fail to take advantage of incentives simply because 
they don't know about them," she said. "We want to expose the business 
community to these to help keep money in their pocket or help their businesses 
grow." 
</P>
<P>
 The two-hour meeting will present information from legislators and the local 
business community, giving Chamber of Commerce directors the chance to meet and 
invite the presenters to their local chapters, Gutierrez said.  
</P>
<P>
 There will be limited seating at the meeting, to be held at the Rosemead 
Sheraton Hotel. Admission is $8.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: JEFFERSON PARK; BARBER LEON AUBRY DIES; ACTIVIST WAS 
77 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leon Aubry, longtime community activist and barbershop proprietor once known 
as "the mayor of Jefferson Boulevard," died Monday of complications following 
heart and stomach cancer surgery. He was 77. 
</P>
<P>
 Aubry, a New Orleans native who moved to Los Angeles in 1951, was active in 
many community-based groups and social organizations, including Catholics 
United for Racial Equality, Kiwanis, the League for Community Improvement, 
Autocrats West, Jefferson Council and the Sisters of the Blessed Sacrament. 
</P>
<P>
 He also aided political campaigns and spearheaded many fund-raisers, including 
an annual Jefferson Council gala to benefit the school at St. John the 
Evangelist Catholic Church in Hyde Park. The event raised almost $12,000 last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 A lifetime entrepreneur, Aubry operated several small businesses in New 
Orleans, including the city's first black-owned bowling alley, before heading 
west. He ran Aubry's Barber Shop on Jefferson Boulevard for 37 years until the 
building was torn down in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Undaunted, he moved his operation to the garage of his home on 12th Avenue, 
where his many friends, family members and New Orleans cronies continued to 
gather for haircuts and the lively talk that had become legendary in the 
surrounding Crenshaw and Leimert Park neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The regulars at Aubry's shop hailed from a wide range of professions and walks 
of life, from stellar entertainer Nat King Cole to local politician and former 
Mayor Tom Bradley to scores of doctors, social activists and just plain folk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only did the Aubry family suffer a a great loss, the whole community lost 
a great leader," Bradley said. "His barbershop was a listening post, an action 
center for a lot of things. When you went there, you knew exactly where you 
stood."  
</P>
<P>
 Aubry is survived by his wife, Esmeralda; a son, Leon Jr.; a daughter, 
Saundra; three brothers, Edris, Thomas and Larry; and many nieces, nephews and

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: CRENSHAW; REVITALIZATION OF RIOT AREAS TO BE 
DISCUSSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Community Redevelopment Agency is sponsoring an open community meeting to

CITY ARTS; LOVING LOOK AT 'EL ARTE DEL AMOR' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Self-Help Graphics will sponsor an artists' reception today for its premiere 
exhibit of the year, "El Arte del Amor/The Art of Love" at Galeria Otra Vez. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit will feature works from Richard James Beltran, Elizabeth Perez and 
Maria Rendon, and will highlight a suite of paintings by Peter Tovar. 
</P>
<P>
 Tovar, 45, who helped found the gallery's folk craft store, is presenting his 
work after a 20-year absence from painting. 
</P>
<P>
 The show's theme, he said, fits right in with the rediscovery of his love for 
painting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each of us is trying to represent our feelings of love, and mine are aimed at 
a lot of old memories," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In search of ideas, Tovar said he continued to uncover the lessons of his 
grandmother while he was growing up near San Jose, working with his family in 
the orchards. 
</P>
<P>
 His grandmother would pull up a crate and tell the children the stories of her 
life in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "My paintings try to keep my grandmother's memories alive. I'm trying to keep 
that warmth and love of my grandmother," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always trying to think of my own ideas and found that I didn't have 
any. I was searching until I found them in my childhood, my past." 
</P>
<P>
 "El Arte del Amor/The Art of Love," Galeria Otra Vez, 3802 Avenida Cesar 
Chavez; through Jan. 29; 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Tuesday through Saturday; free 
opening reception 4 to 8 p.m. today; (213) 264-1259.

ROOSEVELT ACE HONED SKILLS ON BLACKTOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ENRIQUE LAVIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Denise Caudillo wears her name well. 
</P>
<P>
 In Spanish, caudillo means "leader." And in Roosevelt High School basketball 
terminology, Denise means "the boss." 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-7 guard, who led the City Section last season with a 23.1-point 
average, helped the Lady Riders win the Eastern League 4-A Division title after 
moving up from 3-A. 
</P>
<P>
 "At times I'm a good leader," said the 17-year-old senior, who was the Eastern 
League's Most Valuable Player last season. "Sometimes I feel it's individual 
effort, but it always comes back to teamwork. We have great players on our 
team." 
</P>
<P>
 Caudillo fronts the team with an aggressive style she picked up on the 
blacktop in parks, where she usually took on the boys. Under her leadership, 
the Lady Riders are seeking to dethrone Crenshaw, the City Section Division 4-A 
defending champions.  
</P>
<P>
 "She's a great dribbler and a rough-and-tough girl who's not afraid to shoot 
from the outside or drive her way right to the basket," said Coach Lorenzo 
Garcia, who has guided the Lady Riders to four league titles and one City 
Section 3-A Division championship during the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Caudillo has steadily built an impressive resume, and co-captains the team 
with senior Leona Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
 In her first season on the squad, Caudillo was part of the team that went on 
to become the 1991-92 City Section's Division 3-A runner-up. She was an 
All-City 3-A first-team choice that season. And besides being named 1992-93 
Eastern League MVP as a junior, Caudillo has been a two-time City Times 
selection. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's one of the reasons our team is so successful," said Garcia. "She's in 
the running for an All-City (selection) this year." 
</P>
<P>
 When she was in the sixth grade, Caudillo was drawn to the sport by kids 
shooting hoops on the playgrounds. Encouraged by friends and family to develop 
her basketball skills, Caudillo joined her junior high school team while some 
of her friends had to watch from the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some parents don't let kids play, and that's common in a Latino household," 
she said of her family's support. "Some Latino families don't pay attention to 
their kids and then the kids get into gangs and stuff like that." 
</P>
<P>
 The only "stuff" Caudillo has is right. 
</P>
<P>
 When it's girl-on-girl, her hard-driving style breaks loose and Caudillo can 
shoot the lights out. "When I'm really into my game, I play real aggressive and 
physical. I always try to go into the baseline (under the basket)." 
</P>
<P>
 With 97 wins in five years coaching, Garcia is counting on Caudillo, who has 
averaged 18.5 points in eight contests this season, to boost him to his 100th 
victory. With three other shooters averaging in the double digits, the century 
mark shouldn't be that difficult to reach. Jacobs follows Caudillo with 15 
points a game while juniors Zenobia Tyson-Hunt and Edna Alvarez are at the 
captains' heels with 14 and 10 points, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt has only lost one game this season, having come out as runner-up in 
the Washington Holiday Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Lady Riders lost to Washington a month ago, Caudillo has put 
things in perspective. "The competition is what I like best about the game . . 
. and I'm a good loser," she said after the 70-62 loss, in which she scored a 
team high 17 points. "I see it as just a tournament and I know in the long run 
we'll meet Washington again." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet she's not as certain as to where she'll take her scoring abilities after 
high school. She said she doesn't have a No. 1 college choice. However, Garcia 
said, several top basketball universities have expressed interest in the 
athlete, including Cal State Long Beach and Cal Poly Pomona and Cal State Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Her success on the court has brought her somewhat of a mini-celebrity status 
at Roosevelt. And she enjoys it. "But I don't let it get to my head. It just 
feels good to see a Latina do something good."

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: ON THE PENINSULA, EDUCATION FUND-RAISERS ALWAYS FLY 
FIRST-CLASS.

 WHATEVER HAPPENED TO BAKE SALES?: Like other community educational groups, the 
Peninsula Education Foundation, which donates money to the Palos Verdes 
Peninsula Unified School District, is trying to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
 And like other groups, the foundation decided to have a raffle. 
</P>
<P>
 Only this is the Palos Verdes Peninsula. The big prize in the "Ticket to 
Excellence" drawing is not the predictable television set: It's a dream 
vacation for two to Australia and the South Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand prize winner will "experience" Air New Zealand's service on a 
round-trip flight from Los Angeles to Sydney, spend three nights in the new, 
five-star ANA Hotel near Sydney Harbor and then fly round trip to Hamilton 
Island -- only a leisurely cruise away to the Great Barrier Reef. There, the 
winner and guest may relax for three nights in the premiere room of the 
Hamilton Towers hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 1993-94 school year, the foundation donated $450,000 for classroom 
aides, computer education specialists, library aides, writing tutors, math 
mentors, substance abuse prevention counseling and a college and career 
information center. Proceeds from the raffle will go for similar purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets are $10 each or $50 for a book of six; the drawing will be held Jan. 
23. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 RABBIT, RUN: If you're looking for an alternative to the South Bay's congested 
freeways, hop on board the "Rabbit Transit," a new commuter shuttle bus service 
operated by the Metropolitan Transit Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The shuttles, 22-passenger minibuses, begin daily service on Monday and will 
run a 23-mile route from Westchester to El Segundo, making about 42 stops, 
including several at Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 James Cragin, an MTA board member and Gardena councilman, said the shuttle 
service will especially benefit several major aerospace companies in the area 
such as McDonnell Douglas, Hughes and Northrop. 
</P>
<P>
 Several employers have already indicated their willingness to use the service 
and a few companies will reimburse workers who ride the buses, Cragin noted. 
</P>
<P>
 The shuttle service is part of an 18-month pilot project at MTA. If 
successful, the service could expand to other South Bay areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope the bunny system multiplies," Cragin said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 REWARD DOUBLED: The reward for the arrest and conviction of the gunman who 
killed Manhattan Beach Police Officer Martin Ganz doubled last week to 
$100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated that previous reward offers yielded no suspects in the Dec. 27 
shooting, an anonymous donor, who had previously pledged $25,000, agreed to add 
$10,000 to the reward fund. The Manhattan Beach Police Officers Assn. has 
donated $15,000 and the City Council has put up $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand they are getting 20 to 30 calls for the trust fund a day," said 
City Manager Bill Smith. "And more money is continuing to come in." QUOTE OF 
THE WEEK 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not trying to say Rolling Hills is a bad place. But it's not the real 
world. It's insulated, it's got the security." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Susan Brooks, Rancho Palos Verdes mayor and congressional candidate, 
criticizing Rep. Jane Harman (D-Marina del Rey) for seeking a 
multimillion-dollar estate in Rolling Hills. LAST WEEK'S HIGHLIGHTS 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles: The City Council shelved a proposal to drop its lawsuit against 
the Port of Long Beach over environmental cleanup of adjacent waterfront 
property. The council took the action after its attorneys and the Port of Long 
Beach were unable to settle the case. 
</P>
<P>
 San Pedro: The Los Angeles City Council postponed a decision for 60 days on 
instituting a new property assessment on businesses located in downtown San 
Pedro. The assessment, to finance public works improvements, would affect 
businesses in an area generally bounded by Harbor Boulevard, Pacific Avenue, 
3rd and 10th streets. JEFF CARMONA and LISA RICHARDSON, with staff reports

 The Norris Theatre will kick off its spring season today with a production of 
the children's classic "101 Dalmatians." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on a 1956 British story, the musical follows the lives of puppies 
"dog-napped" by Cruella De Vil and her henchmen.The story, which has been 
translated into more than a dozen languages, was made into a 1961 Walt Disney 
animated film of the same name. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater production allows for audience participation. 
</P>
<P>
 Children, and young-at-heart adults, are encouraged to assume the roles of the 
lost Dalmatians by barking, rolling around and pretending to climb over fences 
-- without ever leaving their seats. 
</P>
<P>
 With lavish costumes and lively music, the musical is designed to entertain 
and educate theatergoers, said Michele Roberge, Norris' director of marketing 
and development. 
</P>
<P>
 The musical, produced by the Arvada Center Children's Theatre of Colorado, 
retains the original British flavor that, Roberge said, was lost in the Disney 
film. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater added an evening performance after two afternoon shows sold out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents realize how important it is to expose kids to live productions," 
Roberge said. "It really opens (children's) eyes and opens their imaginations." 
</P>
<P>
 The Norris Theatre, a 450-seat community playhouse in Rolling Hills Estates, 
is celebrating its 10th year. This weekend's show is the latest in a series of 
productions geared toward younger crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberge said the children's series has blossomed since its introduction four 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Three performances of "101 Dalmatians" are scheduled for today, but tickets 
are selling fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for the 6:30 p.m. show are $12 through the Norris Theatre Box Office; 
(310) 544-0403. Free parking is next to the theater, at 27570 Crossfield Drive 
at Indian Peak Road. The show is recommended for children 5 and older.

PHOTO EXHIBIT RECALLS CAMBODIA'S BLOODY LEGACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Impressions of Cambodia," an exhibit of 200 photographs that has opened in 
Long Beach, shows vistas of the Southeast Asian nation mostly taken by local 
members of the Cambodian community during visits to their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 For Sithea San, director of the Arts of Apsara Gallery in the United Cambodian 
Community Plaza of Long Beach, "Impressions of Cambodia" is about much more 
than images of her homeland hanging on the wall.The show is about remembering 
and telling the world. 
</P>
<P>
 A few older photographs, dated before the start of the civil war in the early 
1970s, dot the exhibit. These were included, San said, to show people what the 
capital, Phnom Penh, looked like before war set in and nearly leveled the city. 
The exhibit includes pictures of the country's holiest temple, Angkor Wat, 
basking in a former glory that has been somewhat diminished by theft and 
erosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Prince Norodom Sihanouk, who recently returned to power in the self-appointed 
role of his country's savior, also makes an appearance in the photographs. And 
for those who might have forgotten Sihanouk's role in bringing the bloody Khmer 
Rouge to power, there are photos of the prince posing with Khmer Rouge 
warriors. He is smiling and wearing their clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to show this so everyone will remember what happened to Cambodia," San 
said. "So they will know what can happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 "Impressions of Cambodia" runs through Feb. 24 at the Arts of Apsara Gallery, 
2338 E. Anaheim St., Long Beach. Admission is free and the gallery is open from 
1 to 5 p.m. Tuesday through Friday. Information: (310) 433-2490.

NEWS ANALYSIS; FAA'S POLICY COLLISION: INDUSTRY OR SAFETY FIRST?; AIR TRAVEL: 
O.C. CRASH LINKED TO 757 TURBULENCE REVEALS AGENCY TORN BETWEEN PROTECTING 
PUBLIC AND AIRLINE PROFITS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 As the Federal Aviation Administration weighed recommendations more than two 
years ago that it require more landing distance between Boeing 757 jetliners 
and planes following behind them, the agency found itself trying to serve two 
oft-competing masters: the welfare of the public it is charged to protect and 
the industry it was formed to promote. 
</P>
<P>
 At the root of recent revelations that the FAA had repeated warnings that 757s 
produced dangerous wake turbulence lies a harsh economic reality: The agency 
knew any landing restriction it imposed would mean flight reductions and 
further revenue losses for an industry that has gone $10 billion in the red 
since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the Dec. 15 crash of a corporate jet in Santa Ana that flew into 757 
wake turbulence, killing all five people aboard, and a similar accident that 
killed eight people in December, 1992, many observers believe the FAA may have 
chosen the industry's rail-thin profit margin over the public's safety margin. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA took no action on the 757 turbulence issue -- until recently -- 
despite compelling evidence from the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration, the United Kingdom's Civil Aviation Authority and the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can make a safety recommendation, but then the economic factors come in 
to play," said Leo Garodz, a former FAA manager who was among the first to 
bring the 757 wake turbulence problem to the agency's attention. An FAA 
specialist in wake turbulence for 20 years, Garodz said his 1991 
recommendations on the 757 were not made lightly, but he is sympathetic to the 
FAA's plight. "You're between the devil and the deep blue sea. On the one hand, 
you've got safety. On the other, you've got the industry." 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for the dilemma, critics say, is easy enough to illustrate: 
</P>
<P>
 On average, 74 Boeing 757s land every day at Los Angeles International 
Airport, mostly during peak travel hours. Other jets must remain at least three 
miles behind. If the FAA landing distance requirement was increased by two 
miles and made mandatory -- as some have suggested be done in the wake of the 
accidents -- it would effectively push back all of the planes bound for the 
airport. To the airlines, it could mean roughly 30 fewer jets could land during 
peak travel days. 
</P>
<P>
 At an average of 200 passengers per plane, the lost revenue is significant. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's just one airport -- multiply that times the number of airports in 
the country and you can see how quickly it adds up to millions of dollars in 
lost opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 FAA spokesman Fred O'Donnell in Los Angeles acknowledged that the agency does 
have twin missions: to keep the skies safe and "to foster the growth of civil 
aviation." But he said it was an "oversimplification" to characterize the 757 
decision-making process as a safety-versus-money matter. He said the evidence 
given to the FAA over the past two years, while compelling to many, was 
inconclusive to the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the fall of 1991, at least two formal reports on the potential dangers 
of 757 wake turbulence were presented to the FAA, in addition to anecdotal 
evidence garnered from pilots by NASA's Aviation Safety Reporting System. One 
of the reports, a study by Garodz and Kirk Clawson, a NOAA researcher, 
concluded that the medium-sized 757 appeared to generate the most powerful wake 
turbulence they had ever measured -- more powerful than aircraft nearly four 
times its size. The researchers recommended to the FAA that it immediately 
require smaller planes be kept four miles behind 757s on final approach under 
all circumstances and that further testing be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Wake turbulence occurs when a jet speeds through the air, leaving an 
invisible, but potentially lethal trail of horizontal cyclones that spring out 
from each wingtip. Such turbulence can cause even mid-sized jets to pitch 
violently, but it can toss around smaller aircraft like mere toys. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent accident believed to have been linked to 757 wake turbulence 
claimed the lives of two executives of the In-N-Out burger chain when a 
twin-engine jet landing about two miles behind a 757 at John Wayne Airport went 
out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 Garodz said his and Clawson's landing distance recommendations "went over like 
a lead balloon" because "there always is pressure from the industry to close 
down separation distances." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Garodz said, when the FAA embarked on the study, which also called 
for testing the large Boeing 767, it harbored hopes that the results would 
allow it to decrease the existing separation requirements for those two 
aircraft. So did United Airlines, which proffered aircraft to use in the study. 
</P>
<P>
 "United Airlines believes the potential benefit of this scientific test -- 
proving that airport capacity can be increased 5 to 10% by safely reducing the 
separation between planes -- justifies its contribution of aircraft and crew 
members for this study," James M. Guyette, a United executive vice president, 
said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Garodz and Clawson also advised the FAA that the space requirement for the 767 
-- six miles for smaller aircraft -- not be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 That, too, was greeted with "less than enthusiasm," Garodz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody likes delays," he said. "They want to bring the planes closer and 
increase traffic flow." To this day, the FAA says it regularly receives 
proposals from airline carriers, manufacturers and airports to increase the 
number of passengers they handle by decreasing space requirements between 
aircraft. The reason: because the bottom line in aircraft spacing is just that, 
the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry experts say the distances planes are kept apart are designed to 
maximize the number of paying passengers filing through airports -- and 
therefore, industry profits -- while meeting acceptable safety criteria. 
Increasing that distance can mean reductions in flights and delays. And in the 
commercial aviation industry, minutes can mean millions. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the FAA, an average delay of just 10 minutes per flight -- which 
would be a minor annoyance to a passenger -- at an airport the size of 
Seattle-Tacoma International results in a combined $93-million in losses for 
the airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, according to an FAA report, 23 of the nation's largest airports each 
suffered more than $32 million in losses, solely due to delays, many of which 
occurred because the approach routes to those destinations were so packed with 
planes. The problem is, there is only so much navigable airspace to go around, 
and every airline wants to be in it during convenient flying hours, from dawn 
to dusk. 
</P>
<P>
 Any lengthening of distance requirements between aircraft makes for fewer 
flights and fewer opportunities for takeoffs and landings during optimal flying 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll never say it, but the FAA is in the business of keeping aircraft 
moving," said pilot Peter Murray, who has flown commercial jets for 28 years 
and regularly skippers 757s. "It basically comes down to dollars and cents." 
</P>
<P>
 All of which makes hard-hit airline carriers more interested in reducing 
airplane separation standards, which would allow them to land more planes, more 
frequently, and would improve their bottom lines in tight fiscal times with 
existing resources. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, said John O'Brien from the Air Line Pilots Assn., which often finds 
itself fighting for increased space between aircraft for safety reasons, "We 
see much more interest in doing these things when people are looking for a way 
to better themselves economically." 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA acknowledges there is a direct correlation between the lack of 
navigable airspace and aircraft separation requirements, and it is an area of 
concern "to the FAA and the entire industry," spokesman O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Listed among the goals of the FAA's 1991 annual report on the airport capacity 
problem: "More efficient spacing along the final approach path." 
</P>
<P>
 "The FAA's position is that there is insufficient capacity in this country to 
meet the projected needs," O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that the FAA has recently taken actions that suggest the 757 
could be re-classified as a "heavy" jet, which could require up to two miles of 
increased spacing, from four miles to six miles, for smaller tailing aircraft, 
the agency strongly asserted that it did not sacrifice safety by ignoring the 
data it had received. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it was with no information other than the two recent crashes that 
prompted FAA Administrator David Hinson to issue a bulletin Dec. 22, 
instructing the nation's air traffic controllers to inform pilots landing 
behind 757s they are following a "B-757" and should be aware of potentially 
heavy turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donnell said the agency would never compromise the "traveling public" or the 
"public that lives under the flight path." But, he said, "we do recognize that 
certain orders will have a definite economic impact. We have to be realistic," 
he said. "We have to ask, 'Will this create an economic hardship that will 
destroy the industry?' 
</P>
<P>
 "We are concerned about the economic viability of an air carrier and whether 
or not they stay in business," he said. "But we will not compromise safety . . 
. just for the sake of allowing that business to stay in business." 
</P>
<P>
 While the FAA looks out for airline manufacturers and carriers, O'Donnell 
said, the agency does not shirk from taking a tough stand. He referred to the 
Noise and Capacity Act of 1991, which required by the year 2000 that the 
industry phase out older models such as 727s, 747s and DC-9s in favor of 
quieter, more fuel-efficient, twin-engine aircraft such as the 757, 767 and the 
new 777. 
</P>
<P>
 "The airline industry did not like it," said O'Donnell. "They maintained that 
it would force many of them out of business. Nevertheless, we felt there was a 
need to do that, and we did it." 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, Boeing spokeswoman Elizabeth Reese said the company, which has 
been hit hard by recession and in February announced the phasing out of 28,000 
jobs over the next two years, would need to "examine closely" any proposal to 
increase separation distances for the 757. In addition to the concern about 
increased delays, Reese said, there is another complication: Many 
environmentally sensitive airports, such as John Wayne in Orange County, bar 
aircraft classified as "heavy." Reclassifying the 757 as a "heavy" would likely 
make the aircraft builder's third most popular jet less marketable, experts 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Slots are few and airports are real crowded," Reese said. "You try to get the 
airplanes in and out as fast as you can." 
</P>
<P>
 At a minimum, aviation sources say, even if the FAA didn't want to adopt 
stricter spacing requirements when it first learned of the 757's dangerous wake 
turbulence problem, it was obliged to alert pilots so they could take extra 
precautions. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, the commercial jet pilot, said air traffic controllers are very busy 
and frequently encourage pilots to fly under visual-flight rules, which takes 
much of the responsibility for maintaining a safe distance between aircraft off 
the controller's shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obvious with this wake vortex problem you can't just tell a small-plane 
pilot, 'There's a Boeing 757 in front of you, good luck. You're on your own.' 
</P>
<P>
 "He has no way of knowing how far he is from the jet in front of him," said 
Murray, whose son flies commuter planes. "He's hoping he's far enough away, but 
the controllers know." 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, who asked that the airline carrier he flies for not be named, said he 
has no doubts that economic issues played a role in the decision not to act on 
the 757 spacing recommendations. He suspects the 757 spacing criteria may 
change now. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only possible reason for not doing it is because it means dollars and 
cents," Murray said. "They'll say, 'This is one of the world's busiest airports 
and how are we going to stretch aircraft out,' but that's just tough. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is something that needs immediate reaction. You know, all these kids are 
getting killed at this crosswalk. We need to put in a stoplight. We don't want 
to do it; it's going to cost a lot of money. But we've got to." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien from the Air Line Pilots Assn., which represents 40,000 pilots from 38 
airlines, said ALPA for years has asked that the type of wake turbulence 
testing done three years ago on the 757 be made a routine part of the airline 
certification process. But "there wasn't great enthusiasm for that," he said. 
It appears a stronger case could be made for it now, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 William Reynard, head of NASA's Aviation Safety Reporting System, which twice 
alerted the FAA last year to the 757 problem, said the FAA does the "best it 
can" in weighing safety and economic issues. But he said "I think it's 
intelligent at this point" that the FAA has begun further testing on the 757 
and is considering creating a special category for spacing purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Carey, a close friend of John O. McDaniel, the pilot of the plane that 
crashed in Santa Ana last month after encountering 757 wake turbulence, said 
safety factors should far outweigh monetary ones. "I'm not an aviator, but 
safety comes first and nothing else should be considered," said Carey, the 
captain of a container ship that regularly makes trans-Pacific runs between Los 
Angeles and Honolulu. "Granted, you want your company to make some profits, but 
I don't see throwing in a risk factor for monetary reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look what could have been avoided in this case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carey said if McDaniel, a skilled pilot by all accounts, had at least been 
warned about the 757 wake turbulence problem, he would have paid special 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just seems a shame that they've known about this for so long and didn't 
say anything," Carey said. "There's a lot of families affected by this -- a lot 
of wives, a lot of kids, a lot of friends, a lot of lives."

KOREATOWN SEEING QUIET, STEADY EXODUS; SAFETY: MANY BUSINESS OWNERS, FED UP 
WITH THE CRIME IN L.A., ARE FLEEING TO O.C. AND OTHER SUBURBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The nightmares ceased when Byong Chon finally threw in the fried chicken 
apron. 
</P>
<P>
 He won the footrace with the phantom gang member who stalked him nightly in 
his dreams to the brink of a plunging cliff. He silenced the memories of voices 
screaming, "Go back to Korea," the fists thudding against the bulletproof 
plexiglass that was his window on South-Central Los Angeles. He no longer 
divided customers into simple categories of friend or foe. 
</P>
<P>
 From the soot and grit of a broken Louisiana Fried Chicken restaurant, Chon 
fled fresh memories of riots and hate to a high-rent bistro in a gleaming 
16-story Orange County office tower where he serves grilled chicken to Xerox 
Corp. employees in business suits and tailored dresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Chon was only following the quiet advice of other Korean immigrants who, with 
little fanfare, are shifting businesses and ambitions to Orange County suburban 
strip malls, placid Central California communities and distant metropolises 
like Denver, Seattle, Las Vegas or Salt Lake City that offer the elusive 
promise of economic boom and high crime bust. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in business in L.A. for money, but I got tired of the combat," said 
Chon, 38, who now wears the spotless royal blue apron of his Checker's Cafe. 
"Ninety-five percent of the reason why I left is security." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody seems to know for sure how many Korean immigrants are leaving the core 
of Los Angeles and Koreatown in pursuit of a crime safety net. And in fact, 
some leaders representing the Koreatown Chamber of Commerce insist any movement 
is insignificant, reflecting largely the driving force of a poor economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Others say the migration is steady and constant, measured not by census 
statistics, but by the sudden 400% population surge of a small Korean church in 
Irvine or the solid, undramatic sales of Garden Grove real-estate broker James 
Hong, who listens to the laments of Los Angeles merchants worried about the 
safety hazards of their jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a movement that Denver real-estate broker Doug Anh gauges by the weekly 
visits from Los Angeles visitors who have assigned him the task of scouting 
liquor stores or dry-cleaning businesses for sale. In the past two years, he 
said he handled the sales of 70 liquor stores and 40 dry-cleaning shops to 
Korean immigrants leaving Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Just by looking at his membership roster, Kern County grocer Kenny Kim detects 
signs of an exodus. Since he moved to Central California from the San Fernando 
Valley five years ago, he has watched the Korean American Grocers of Kern 
County grow exponentially from a charter membership of one -- himself. His 
association has increased to more than 100 Korean merchants, 90% of them from 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The migration has become more obvious as time has passed," said Eui Young Yu, 
a professor of sociology at Cal State Los Angeles who has studied the 
development of the Korean community in Los Angeles since 1968. "A year after 
the riots, people were in shock and were trying to see whether they could 
recover. Now there seems to be this trend of moving out." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before the April, 1992, riots in South-Central Los Angeles, Yu wrote a 
sentimental column for one of the major Korean-language newspapers, musing 
about how a Koreatown cafe had the same texture, color and enthusiasm of Main 
Street, Seoul. But today Yu couldn't bring himself to write such a column. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see much less people and there is no air of enthusiasm and hope," Yu 
said. "I grew up with Koreatown, and when I see this, I'm sad, really sad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I . . . I'm heartbroken." 
</P>
<P>
 Yu blames the malaise on the aftershocks of the riots, which he said 
exacerbated the already existing movement of prosperous Korean immigrants to 
the city's outer rings and suburbs like those in Orange County. In 1990, the 
census showed that more than 37,400 Koreans were living in Orange County 
although some Korean community leaders estimate the population at more than 
double that figure. 
</P>
<P>
 That migration, according to many Korean business people and community 
leaders, has continued to trickle out to the suburbs although it is a scattered 
movement that has not noticeably affected any particular community. And, they 
say, it has spread even farther: to San Francisco, Central California and to 
other states like Washington, Utah, Arizona and Kansas, where the economy is 
healthier and the crime rate is lower. 
</P>
<P>
 In Arizona, Korean business people from Los Angeles have resettled in downtown 
clothing shops and a thriving indoor swap meet in Nogales. In Seattle, 
real-estate agent Kyung Kim said he tried to tantalize Californians to move 
with advertisements in the Los Angeles Korean papers touting Seattle's clean 
air and "nice lakes." 
</P>
<P>
 Kyung Kim closed his dental laboratory in Koreatown and moved to Seattle five 
years ago after he was robbed in his shop and an employee was attacked in the 
parking lot. "People coming from California complain about crime. That's all 
anybody talks about. But the problem is that many are still having problems 
selling their businesses in Los Angeles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some riot victims said it took them months to fully appreciate the anger 
directed toward them. And once they did, they said the hostility and the 
insecurity they felt eventually played a part in their departure. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't like us," said Chon, the owner of the Santa Ana cafe who moved 
after his restaurant on Westin and Jefferson streets was destroyed in the 
riots. "They're rude to us and they discriminate against us. Many times they 
tell me, 'Go back to Korea.' I say I can't. I am from here. I have citizenship 
like you. No matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen months after his jewelry shop burned down in the South-Central riots, 
Tae Seung Lee changed professions and selected a new name for his business 
venture in Laguna Hills in South Orange County. For this new store, he chose a 
Spanish name -- La Paz, which means peace in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's more security here," said Lee, 33, who added that it doesn't matter 
that his expenses are higher in the suburbs. "I think I was in tough area. I 
twice experienced robberies and I wanted safety. Here it is calm and nice 
people around." 
</P>
<P>
 During the Los Angeles riots, looters destroyed almost 2,000 Korean-owned 
businesses, wiping out liquor stores, swap meets, markets and dry cleaners. In 
retrospect, the fury and direction of the riots into Koreatown revealed a class 
war, pitting other groups against the Korean shopkeepers over jobs and 
businesses and resources, argues Charles Jencks, author of Heteropolis, a study 
of Los Angeles and its diverse population and architecture. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a group that was clearly targeted in Los Angeles and they know that 
now," said Angela Oh, a Los Angeles lawyer who is president of the Korean 
American Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Frequently, Oh visits other Korean communities across the country to deliver 
speeches and lectures about the aftershocks of the riots. At a Seattle 
conference of the Korean Grocers Assn. recently, she noticed that many of the 
Los Angeles participants were also using their time to seek out local 
real-estate agents. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the grocers who fear the threat of violence the most, but they don't get 
much comfort from the cold headlines of local Korean newspapers. For instance, 
the Korean KOREAM Journal devoted its December edition to the hard life of 
Korean grocers and included a full-page memorial describing each of the 44 
Korean victims of violent crime in 1993. Most of the victims were killed or 
wounded in the city center. 
</P>
<P>
 "In these times," opined the Journal, "there is so much han." Han is a Korean 
word with no exact English translation, but it roughly means a sense of 
frustration or shame, a feeling of anger over injustice. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the store owners describe their fears and flashback nightmares to Ryan 
Song, who heads the statewide Korean American Grocers Assn. At least twice a 
month, he said he shudders at the latest news about violent incidents involving 
Korean merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 "One usually dies and the other survives," Song said. "That kind of persistent 
violence is making people weary of South-Central." So it is that business 
people like Hank Kim or Tyson B. Park have found a receptive audience for their 
speeches or advice, which is best summed up by this simple precept: Leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "I encourage them to move out," said Park, a lawyer who represented one of the 
major Korean victim associations formed after the riots. "They have no future 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 "After the riots I wasn't sure and I didn't say anything," he said. "Then I 
started telling my clients who had businesses in South-Central L.A. to move. I 
knew it was coming. Now they're moving to Orange County, Riverside, San 
Bernardino. If you have decent capital, you don't operate in South-Central L.A. 
It's too dangerous and risky." 
</P>
<P>
 Park would like to follow his growing customer base to Orange County, but says 
he still feels too rooted to his Koreatown offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Hank Kim, the owner of a Laguna Hills dry-cleaning store and past president of 
the statewide Korean Dry Cleaners Assn., said he advises immigrants to head for 
boom towns like Denver or Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The primary reason they're leaving is they feel there's too much crime," he 
said. "Also, with other corporations shutting down, the smaller businesses are 
having a tough time surviving." 
</P>
<P>
 His circle of friends has slowly dwindled. Three couples have moved to Las 
Vegas, six to Denver. But Hank Kim said he has also watched former L.A. 
residents boost the membership in his Irvine church, Bethel Korean Church. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past three years, Bethel -- which is part of a small Protestant 
denomination called the Christian and Missionary Alliance -- has grown from 450 
members to 2,200. 
</P>
<P>
 The church's education minister, Moon Ju Kim, credits the growth partly to an 
exodus from Los Angeles and partly to the ministry of the church. Some of the 
membership increase happened before the riots, but growth has remained steady 
ever since, Moon Ju Kim said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The riots had a tremendous psychological impact," Moon Ju Kim said. "In 
talking with my people, there's a tremendous fear and pessimistic outlook on 
the city. It's fear of the unknown, fear of becoming a target again, the 
feelings of racial tensions." 
</P>
<P>
 But making a move launches a new set of fears. The costs of operating a 
suburban store or business are generally higher. Merchants leaving the 
Koreatown area must also know enough English to cater to English speakers 
instead of a Korean base of customers. And some desirable areas are already 
saturated with the types of businesses that the newcomers wish to operate. 
</P>
<P>
 Anh, the commercial real-estate broker from Denver, said he meets weekly with 
at least three Korean families seeking businesses to launch a new life in the 
city. The problem, he said, is that most of the Koreans are looking for a 
particular category of business: dry cleaners, sandwich shops, liquor stores, 
gift shops and fast-food restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to live in this city because we don't have many jobs," he said. 
"And we also don't have many businesses for sale that they're looking for." Not 
all the potential buyers are coming from Los Angeles. Some, said Colorado 
National Bank personal loan officer Joon Choi, are also abandoning the suburbs 
such as those in Orange County or the San Fernando Valley for Denver and its 
public school system and cheaper real-estate prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Santa Ana liquor store owner Soo Ill Kim closed his business here and 
moved to Denver four years ago in search of a relatively crime-free 
neighborhood and a city that shuts down liquor stores on Sundays. He said he 
was tired of working his Santa Ana hours -- seven days a week for three years, 
without a single day off. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Soo Ill Kim started telling his friends about the highs of 
the Rocky Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 And they told their friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the riots, Soo Ill Kim said, he has watched the circle of Korean liquor 
store owners that he knows expand from 10 businessmen to 100. 
</P>
<P>
 He is now living among old friends.

MOP-UP OF OILY BEACHES BEGINS IN PUERTO RICO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE CLARY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cleanup crews began mopping up a three-mile stretch of prime tourist beach 
fouled with oil from a leaking barge, while officials launched a delicate 
salvage operation to pump the remaining oil from the vessel, which was lodged 
precariously on an offshore reef Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a dangerous operation," said U.S. Coast Guard Cmdr. Robert Ross of 
the salvage attempt taking place just 300 yards from two of this island's major 
tourist hotels. "We want to make sure we don't hurt or kill anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross said divers had inspected the barge's hull but could not determine the 
extent of damage or how fast the oil was still leaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the leak continued, it was slower than in the early stage of the 
wreck Friday morning, when the barge hemorrhaged about 750,000 gallons of 
heating oil -- half its cargo of fuel. The barge was being towed to the 
Caribbean island of Antigua when a tow line snapped and it ran aground near a 
public beach called Escambron. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a rapid response to the spill and favorable winds appear to have 
contained the spread of the oil, the threat remains that 750,000 more gallons 
may be released from the barge's damaged tanks, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of technicians and engineers, along with dozens of specially trained 
Coast Guard personnel, have been flown to the island, a U.S. commonwealth 1,000 
miles southeast of Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 By late Saturday, a second barge was tied to the wrecked one and tons of 
salvage equipment continued to arrive on the island: hydraulic hoses, skimmers, 
vacuum pumps and collapsible fuel drums to contain the oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Rear Adm. William Leahy, commander of the 7th Coast Guard District that 
includes Puerto Rico, said pumping out all the oil would take about 36 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross said a full cleanup of the oil and the removal of the barge from the reef 
could take weeks. "This is a low-tech operation, and it will take time." 
</P>
<P>
 Puerto Rican officials announced the filing of a lawsuit charging the owners 
of both the barge and the towboat with negligence and operating unseaworthy 
vessels. 
</P>
<P>
 There was conflicting information about who owned the barge, called the Morris 
J. Berman. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross said the barge was owned by New England Marine Services Inc., based in 
New York, and operated by the Bunker Group of Puerto Rico. But Bill Preusch, a 
manager at Standard Tank of Bayonne, N.J., said the barge belonged to his firm 
but had been chartered to another company, which he refused to identify. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pedro Rossello described the oil spill as a "catastrophe," and his chief 
of staff, Alvaro Cifuentes, expressed concern Saturday that the salvage 
operation -- being paid for and directed by the barge's owners -- was 
insufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the governor could decide to ask the federal government to take over 
the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "My main concern is that there are oil slicks going out to sea," Cifuentes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 By Saturday afternoon, the spill stretched over 20 square miles of ocean as 
well as the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard, the FBI, the Environmental Protection Agency and Puerto Rican 
government officials have all announced investigations into the cause of the 
mishap. The crew has given blood and urine samples, which will be tested for 
alcohol and drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Fortuna, director of tourism for Puerto Rico, said the extent of the 
damage to the island's tourism industry would depend on the speed of the 
cleanup "and, frankly, how this is played outside of Puerto Rico." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with minimizing damage to the island's image at the peak of the winter 
tourist season, commonwealth officials said they also hope to avoid a 
large-scale environmental disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The closest ecologically sensitive areas are still miles away from the reach 
of the spilled oil, Ross said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were immediate affects on tourists. As the oil washed ashore to 
cover the rocky seafront along the Atlantic coast, some visitors reported 
feeling nauseated by petroleum fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 Several hotels, including the Caribe Hilton, the Radisson Normandie, the 
Condado Plaza and the Regency, were forced to close their swimming pools, 
open-air bars and restaurants because of the fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 But some people were unfazed by the odor and seemed fascinated by the 
high-seas drama unfolding so close by. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard about this yesterday when I was working, but I couldn't get out of 
the office," said insurance company employee Mayra Rivera, who sat atop a bluff 
and watched the surf pound the barge. "This is the best show in town."

COLUMN ONE; A LONG, HARD FALL FROM GRACE; DERREL THOMAS WAS A DODGER. RICKEY 
ROSS WAS AN ELITE COP. BUT EACH MAN'S LIFE WAS DERAILED BY WHAT HE CALLS FALSE 
ACCUSATIONS. NOW, DURING A DRUG TRIAL, ONE WILL TESTIFY AGAINST THE OTHER.

<P>
 They were both children of South-Central Los Angeles, boys from broken homes 
who left the neighborhood and made good. One was a baseball player known as one 
of the best utility men in the major leagues. The other was a cop, assigned to 
an elite Sheriff's Department narcotics team. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1980s, both their careers were derailed, they say, because of false 
accusations. The baseball player, former Dodger Derrel Thomas, left the major 
leagues amid rumors of drug use. And the cop, Rickey Ross, was arrested for 
allegedly killing three prostitutes, although the charges eventually were 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 The fate of Thomas and Ross became inextricably entwined in 1992 when they 
pulled into a McDonald's parking lot in a gray Cadillac with $151,000 in the 
trunk. They were there, prosecutors say, to buy 22 pounds of cocaine from 
undercover agents running a sting operation. 
</P>
<P>
 The case, scheduled for trial this week, will chronicle the lives of these two 
men who found success -- and later failure -- at the same time, in the same 
city. When they next meet, the former baseball player, who has pleaded no 
contest, will testify against the ex-cop, who insists he is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of their April, 1992, arrest, both men were broke and heavily in 
debt. Thomas, 43, could not get a job with a professional team, he said, 
because of the drug rumors. He owed $330,000 in taxes after a series of bad 
investments and was living at his mother's house because he could not afford an 
apartment. His only income was the $1,500 Dorsey High School paid him to coach 
their baseball team for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just needed some money," Thomas said shrugging. "To take care of my family. 
But I can't justify what I did. . . . I was wrong and I'll never be wrong like 
that again." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross, 45, also was unable to find work after the controversy surrounding the 
prostitute killings. He was released from jail after almost three months in 
custody when the LAPD admitted that ballistics test errors had mistakenly 
linked Ross' gun with the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Sheriff's Department sent him a termination letter stating that 
when he was arrested he had been in a car with a prostitute, who claimed that 
they smoked cocaine together. Ross, an 18-year Sheriff's Department veteran, 
later was allowed to resign. 
</P>
<P>
 During the next few years he could not find steady work and faced foreclosure 
on his Rialto house. Every attempt at obtaining a full-time job failed because 
of his notoriety. He applied for a bus driver job, but was turned down because 
he was told: "There's too much controversy behind your name." 
</P>
<P>
 His court-appointed attorney will not allow him to discuss the details 
surrounding his arrest with Thomas. Ross will say only that he is not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time they arrested me I was unjustly accused and they had to let me 
go," Ross said angrily. "Well, they're still trying to get Rickey Ross. That's 
why they went after me a second time." THE BASEBALL PLAYER: Cocky, Rebellious 
but Valuable to the Team 
</P>
<P>
 Derrel Thomas learned the game in the parks around South-Central during an era 
when baseball, not basketball or football, was the glamour sport in the inner 
city. He was reared by foster parents, an elderly couple known by everyone in 
the neighborhood as "Big Mama" and "Big Daddy." He was lucky, he says, because 
they were so loving, rearing him like one of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from Dorsey High School, Thomas was the first player picked 
in the 1969 winter draft. Within two years, at age 20, he was playing for the 
Houston Astros. 
</P>
<P>
 Some former teammates believe that success might have come too quickly to 
Thomas. He was cocky and he was rebellious, but he was so valuable that teams 
overlooked his attitude. One of the most versatile players in the game, Thomas 
played every position but pitcher during his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Derrel was playing, there was no better utility player in the game," 
said John Young, who has scouted for several major league teams. "With some 
utility players, you put them in to replace a regular and you lose something in 
the field. With Derrel, you didn't lose a thing." 
</P>
<P>
 But during his 15-year career, he also was known for controversy. While with 
the Dodgers in the early 1980s, he angered coaches by making flashy basket 
catches -- his way of paying homage to Willie Mays. Other times he refused to 
be positioned by coaches while in the field. He also occasionally missed team 
buses and planes. 
</P>
<P>
 The most damaging controversy came when former Pittsburgh Pirate star Dave 
Parker testified during a trial in 1985 that years before he had arranged drug 
purchases for a number of players, including Thomas. Thomas, who had no police 
record, was never charged in the case. But the statement, which he said was 
false, ruined his career and scared off teams from hiring him as a player and 
later as a coach. 
</P>
<P>
 After Thomas left baseball he struggled to find his way. He coached briefly in 
the minor leagues, but could not find a steady position. In the late 1980s, he 
coached at Leuzinger High School in the afternoons and managed Ron's Barbary 
Coast, a topless bar in Gardena, at night. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was hired to coach the Dorsey High School team in 1992, he had quit 
the Barbary Coast and was trying to break into acting, landing a brief role in 
a baseball movie and some occasional work as an extra. 
</P>
<P>
 By midseason, Thomas was struggling to keep himself and his baseball team 
together. In a devastating incident, the starting shortstop, playing around 
with a gun, fatally shot himself in the head while returning from a game on the 
team bus. Although Thomas worked hard to console the athletes, he was grappling 
with his own problems at the time. He was broke, his fiancee was pregnant and 
he could not make his next car payment. 
</P>
<P>
 "At a time like that," Thomas said, shaking his head, "you're looking for 
something . . . anything . . . to bring you up." THE COP: From Bibles to 
Harleys to County Jail 
</P>
<P>
 While Thomas was achieving fame with the Dodgers, Ross was rising through the 
ranks of the Sheriff's Department. Four years after joining the department he 
was named an undercover narcotics investigator at the Altadena station. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a hell of an investigator," said J. C Reiff, a retired sheriff's 
detective who worked with Ross. "He turned seven or eight murder cases because 
he had such great rapport with people on the street." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross could infiltrate drug rings because, at 6 feet and 230 pounds, with a 
menacing stare and an intimidating manner, he simply did not look like a cop. 
Ross knew more about life on the streets than many of the young deputies 
entering the department in the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 He was reared in a small South-Central apartment after his mother and 
stepfather split up. Money was tight. His mother supported her two children by 
working as a maid, and when that wasn't enough, getting welfare checks. 
</P>
<P>
 She was extremely religious, Ross said, but an epiphany he had in 1977 helped 
renew his own faith; he crashed his car into a Los Angeles church one night and 
landed in the hospital. Interpreting the accident as a sign from God, Ross 
eventually began ministering to those he believed needed help. On Sunday 
afternoons he preached to patients at a South-Central hospital and, on Monday 
nights, to prisoners at a jail on the Eastside. He often bought Bibles out of 
his own pocket for the inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1980s, he began devoting less time to preaching. Ross said he was 
extremely busy because of a new job assignment -- an elite multi-agency task 
force at Los Angeles International Airport formed to stem drug smuggling. 
</P>
<P>
 But some former deputies say the truth is that by the late 1980s, he had begun 
to change. He was spending more time with his new motorcycle buddies, roaring 
around town on a Harley, wearing a black leather jacket and helmet with "Mad 
Dog" emblazoned on the front. Ross and his buddies occasionally stopped by the 
Barbary Coast, where he first met Derrel Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 It was during this time in Ross' life that he was arrested for the prostitute 
murders. On the night of the 1989 arrest he was on his way home from the 
airport, heading toward the Harbor Freeway and searching for a gasoline station 
that would accept his county gas vouchers. While he was stopped at a light, a 
woman knocked on his window, saying she was stranded and needed a ride to 
Figueroa Street, Ross contended in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was not dressed like a prostitute; I was not looking for prostitutes," he 
said. "There was never any cocaine smoking. . . . In fact, there were 
absolutely no drugs found in my system that night." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross and the woman were soon pulled over by two Los Angeles policemen who said 
the car had been weaving. In the trunk, the officers found Ross' backup gun, a 
loaded 9-millimeter Beretta pistol. LAPD ballistics experts connected the gun 
to the string of highly publicized prostitute killings. Rickey Ross' nightmare 
had begun. 
</P>
<P>
 In jail he was reviled by the prisoners and the guards -- sheriff's deputies, 
some of whom he had once worked with. He was housed in a special section of the 
jail that inmates call "Death Row," where defendants in high-profile cases are 
held. In the cell across from Ross was Richard Ramirez, who was later convicted 
in the "Night Stalker" killings. 
</P>
<P>
 While guards harassed Ross by calling him and Ramirez the "Double-R 
Murderers," prisoners threatened him on the way to the shower. For court 
appearances he was transported in chains on a county bus, often surrounded by 
prostitutes, who screamed and spit at him during the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I'd get to court without even being allowed to wipe the spittle 
from my face," he said. "I was treated like an animal . . . almost destroyed 
for a crime I didn't commit." 
</P>
<P>
 After 82 days in jail, his investigator showed up at his cell one morning and 
said: "Pack your bags. You're going home." Ross shouted "Praise the Lord!" and 
both he and the investigator began to cry. The charges against Ross had been 
dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 "But later a great, sweltering anger came over me," Ross said. "I had been 
totally ruined." THE STING: DEA Uses Informant to Set Up Drug Deal 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ross and Thomas traveled separate roads during their troubled times 
and descent into financial ruin, their lives would come together in early 1992. 
The architect of their arrests was a blond, pudgy man with a taste for Italian 
suits and silk ties. He was a snitch for the Drug Enforcement Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 DEA investigators told him that, if he acted as an undercover informant, the 
long sentence he was facing for drug trafficking would be reduced. His mission, 
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Jane Winston, was to set up a drug deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The informant told drug agents that he used to frequent the Barbary Coast when 
Thomas was the manager. The two had discussed the possibility of putting 
together a cocaine deal, according to court records, but one never 
materialized. The DEA authorized him to try again. 
</P>
<P>
 The informant, who had a history of fraud and drug-related arrests, was 
persistent, calling several times before Thomas agreed to meet him. Portraying 
himself as a wheeler-dealer with extensive business contacts, the informant 
told Thomas that, in exchange for locating a cocaine source, he would line up 
some legitimate business opportunities for the ex-ballplayer. And, of course, 
Thomas could make some fast money after the deal went down. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, he was good," Thomas said, shaking his head and smiling ruefully. "I 
thought he was my savior. . . . I thought he was going to get me out of my 
financial straits . . . and not through drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas said he told the informant that although he did not know any big 
cocaine dealers, he had a few possible leads. He then introduced the informant, 
according to court records, to a hostess at the Barbary Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "The three of them met a few times with some potential sellers, but it didn't 
work out," Winston said. "It never led to anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Because the informant was unable to obtain drugs through Thomas, federal 
agents told the informant to turn the deal around. The agents would provide the 
informant with the drugs if Thomas could find a buyer. This is what agents call 
a reverse sting. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, according to records from the DEA and district attorney's office, is how 
the final chapter of the sting unfolded: 
</P>
<P>
 About a week after the informant announced that he had located a cocaine 
source, the hostess told Thomas she had found a buyer named Rick. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 24, 1992, the informant, Thomas and Rickey Ross met at the Barbary 
Coast, a smoky bar that features topless women dancing beneath flickering neon 
lights. Ross, who was driving a rented Cadillac, had $151,000 in the trunk. The 
hostess was supposed to get $1,000 of it for making the introduction, Thomas 
and the informant each were to get $5,000; the rest of the money was for the 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, Ross and the informant headed out to a McDonald's near the airport to 
make the buy. While Thomas stayed in the car, the informant and Ross met with 
several undercover DEA agents. Ross opened the trunk, zipped opened a small gym 
bag and displayed stacks of bills. 
</P>
<P>
 They returned to the agents' van, where Ross was shown 10 kilograms of cocaine 
in a plastic bag. When he removed a small folding knife from his back pocket to 
test the coke, he was placed under arrest while about 15 agents, who had staked 
out the scene, surrounded the van. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas had completed the transformation from famous to infamous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sat back in that car with my hands cuffed behind my back," he said, shaking 
his head. "It was the low point in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Thomas pleaded no contest to conspiring to buy and sell 22 pounds 
of cocaine. In exchange for testifying against Ross, he will face no more than 
three years in prison. Ross could be sentenced to up to 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
 After the arrest, many were mystified how a seasoned narcotics investigator 
such as Ross could have been snared in an undercover operation. But DEA 
spokesman Ralph Lochridge said that when Ross left the Sheriff's Department, 
reverse stings were extremely rare. 
</P>
<P>
 And they still are controversial. Using drugs as bait, critics say, can verge 
on entrapment. Informants often are suspect because of their own criminal 
background and their motivation to do whatever is necessary to put together a 
drug deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Supplying drugs and pressing people to commit a crime they might not 
otherwise commit is pretty questionable," said Thomas' attorney, public 
defender Verah Bradford. "You're not even getting to the root problem -- the 
people with the drugs." THE AFTERMATH: One Is Contrite, the Other Is Angry 
</P>
<P>
 Those who know Thomas say he should not be judged solely on the basis of the 
arrest. David Arnold, the junior varsity coach who took over the Dorsey team, 
recalls Thomas as a coach "who really cared about the kids." He would come to 
practice an hour early every day, Arnold said, and rake the infield himself. He 
scoured the city for bargains so his players could have better equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about the effect of his arrest on the students he coached -- whom 
he repeatedly warned to stay away from drugs -- Thomas sighed heavily. He would 
like the opportunity, he said, to address the Dorsey student body. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd tell them I made a mistake and I'd tell them not to make that same 
mistake," he said. "I spent six weeks in jail. I had to sell items that were 
very close to me to get out of jail. . . . I created a lot of heartache for my 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Thomas remains active in youth baseball. He umpires on weekends in 
Compton and helps coach young players at a South Gate park. On a recent 
afternoon, Thomas demonstrated how to turn a double play. He is still slender 
and long-legged and moves on the field with the balletic grace of a shortstop. 
</P>
<P>
 His future might be uncertain, but these young players, who carefully study 
his every move, still revere him for what he did in the past, when he was known 
as one of the best utility players in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 While Thomas is contrite, Ross remains angry. The DEA and its informant, he 
said, have lied about the case. "I was lured there under false pretenses. . . . 
There wouldn't have been any case if they hadn't out and out lied." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross spends most of his time at the sprawling Spanish-style home in Rialto he 
shares with his wife, a former flight attendant, and their young daughter. Ross 
no longer has the look of a tough street cop. Like the other golf-playing 
professional men in the neighborhood, he wears polo shirts, slacks and loafers 
without socks. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, his life consists mainly of studying the Bible, attending church 
-- and waiting for his day in court.

PRESIDENT'S EUROPE TRIP TAKES ON A NEW MISSION; DIPLOMACY: CLINTON LEAVES ON 
VISIT THAT WAS PLANNED TO BOLSTER TIES. INSTEAD, HE MUST COUNTER RUSSIAN 
NATIONALISM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton left late Saturday on his first official visit to Europe and 
Russia -- a trip that was planned as a reaffirmation of transatlantic 
friendship but which has already changed to a more urgent mission: countering a 
new threat of Russian nationalism. 
</P>
<P>
 The unexpected strength of ultranationalist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky in 
Russia's parliamentary elections last month has frightened the nations of 
Eastern Europe, worried leaders of Western Europe and shaken Russian President 
Boris N. Yeltsin's reformist government. Clinton himself told reporters last 
week, "I wouldn't say it scares me -- but it concerns me." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, a senior official said, Europe is heading into critical decisions 
-- and possible crises -- over "Russia's fate . . . and whether (Eastern 
Europe) can look west with hope, rather than east with fear." 
</P>
<P>
 The resurgence of Russian nationalism has abruptly turned a once-obscure 
argument over expanding the membership of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization into a concrete debate over who would defend Poland, Hungary and 
the Czech Republic if Moscow "goes bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, with Poland and others pressing to be taken into NATO's protective 
fold, Clinton faces the challenge of leading the first fundamental redesign of 
Western strategy on the Continent since Harry S. Truman and the Allies forged 
the doctrine of containment after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Clinton, who said last year that he wanted to refocus American 
foreign policy toward the economic riches of Asia, is finding that the nagging 
security problems of old Europe are demanding more time than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this century . . . any time the United States has gotten away from or 
withdrawn from Europe, it has led to real trouble," the President said last 
week. "So I want to reaffirm . . . the connection." 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-day journey -- Clinton's third and longest trip outside the United 
States in almost a year in office -- will also be his chance to try on the role 
of leader of the Free World in a way he has not before. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clinton has not acted as the embodiment of American leadership in the world 
the way most presidents have in the last half-century," historian Michael 
Beschloss noted. "He has focused like a laser on domestic affairs, as he 
promised he would. This trip gives him a chance to add another dimension to his 
exercise of leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 The trip will take Clinton to five foreign cities: Brussels, site of NATO and 
European Union headquarters; Prague, capital of the Czech Republic; Moscow; 
Minsk, capital of the former Soviet republic of Belarus, and Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
 The President and his aides have outlined four main goals: 
</P>
<P>
 * Reaffirming American ties to Western Europe, a relationship that was badly 
damaged last year by disagreements over how to end the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina and other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 * Selling an American proposal to bring Eastern European countries into closer 
military cooperation with NATO without explicitly promising them full 
membership in the alliance, which would commit the United States to defend them 
against any invasion -- the "Partnership for Peace." 
</P>
<P>
 * Bolstering Yeltsin, promoting continued economic reform in Russia, 
persuading Russia's armed forces to seek international approval for their 
operations in neighboring republics -- and making clear to Russia's people that 
voting for Zhirinovsky, who plans to run for president, is a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pursuing negotiations to dismantle all remaining Soviet nuclear weapons in 
Russia's neighbors: Ukraine, Belarus and Kazakhstan. 
</P>
<P>
 All four goals are entangled. The Western Europeans are worried about the 
future of Russia and the security of Eastern Europe. The Eastern Europeans want 
guarantees that the West will defend them if Russia ever again seeks to 
dominate its neighbors. The Russians want to be assured that NATO will not 
expand into a larger military pact aimed at hemming them in. And everyone is 
anxious about living next to an unstable Ukraine equipped with a nuclear 
arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
 The balancing act comes together in the Partnership for Peace, Clinton's 
attempt at solving the riddle. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem arose last summer, when Polish President Lech Walesa began 
pressing NATO to invite the new democracies of Eastern Europe to become full 
members of the 44-year-old military alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration was initially sympathetic -- but then discovered, 
belatedly, that such a move could inflame the fears of Russian military 
officers who grew up believing that NATO was a device to surround and strangle 
their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 And, on reflection, the Administration realized that asking the American 
public to embrace a firm commitment to defend Poland, Hungary and the Czech 
Republic -- the most likely candidates for membership -- was a political battle 
it was unsure it wanted to take on. 
</P>
<P>
 So the State Department proposed the Partnership for Peace, a Clintonesque 
compromise that promises something for everyone and hopes to offend no one. 
</P>
<P>
 It offers the Eastern Europeans a new relationship with NATO, to include joint 
military planning, new communications connections, joint exercises, some 
combined operations and the promise that "the door is open" for full membership 
in the alliance at some unspecified time, if everything works out. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russians, too, are offered a place in the partnership, to show the new 
structure is not aimed against them -- although most officials say NATO 
membership for Russia is unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to emphasize that we view it not as putting a limit on NATO 
membership, but as opening the door to fuller partnership," Clinton said last 
week. "I think it clearly will lead, ultimately, to some more countries coming 
into NATO at some point in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 The best outcome, he said, would be the evolution of a new security system 
that included Russia, producing "a Europe that is free of the dividing lines of 
the past, instead of just moving them a little bit further east." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Clinton said, the United States wants to avoid explicitly redrawing 
NATO's defense line because of the possible reaction in Russia: "It would 
promote more insecurity than security." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a balancing act," explained Paul Cornish of the Royal Institute of 
International Affairs in London. "The issue of NATO's enlargement has come too 
soon. The one thing the Eastern Europeans want is a security guarantee. And 
that's the one thing the West can't give them. So there'll be a compromise, a 
fudge." 
</P>
<P>
 Rozanne Ridgway, a former assistant secretary of state in the Ronald Reagan 
Administration, observed: "This is pretty good -- better than it looks at first 
glance. Under this plan, Poland can have a NATO partnership that's pretty 
strong. . . . To make a more formal security guarantee work, you'd have to move 
American and German troops eastward into Poland -- and that would be 
provocative and unnecessary." 
</P>
<P>
 But other foreign policy experts, including former national security advisers 
Zbigniew Brzezinski and Brent Scowcroft, complain that the Partnership for 
Peace is needlessly vague and gives too much weight to Russian concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Administration seems to be worried that extending NATO membership now 
would provoke Russian nationalism," said Robert B. Zoellick, a former 
undersecretary of state in the George Bush Administration. "But that implicitly 
endorses the Russian extremists' view that NATO is a threat. And what happens 
if Russia turns authoritarian? If the United States moves to extend NATO 
membership then, it would be more provocative than doing it now." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, officials say, the impact of the partnership will depend on what 
it turns out to be: a fast track to NATO membership, as the Clinton 
Administration promises, or a side track that further delays membership, as 
Walesa and other Eastern Europeans fear. 
</P>
<P>
 Walesa, Czech President Vaclav Havel and the other Eastern European leaders 
Clinton plans to meet this week all have indicated they will gladly accept the 
partnership offer but they will continue to press for more. 
</P>
<P>
 The jockeying over Eastern Europe has already had one positive effect, though: 
It has improved the relationships between the Administration and the nation's 
traditional allies in Western Europe, which were badly frayed by disagreements 
over Bosnia last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last May, Secretary of State Warren Christopher took the Europeans an American 
proposal to lift the international arms embargo from Bosnia -- and they turned 
him down flat, a humiliating public setback. That soured the American 
relationships with Britain and France for months, and spilled over into other 
issues such as military cooperation in Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 By most accounts, relations are better now -- as long as the subject of Bosnia 
remains banished from the table. But Bosnia is almost certain to come up this 
week; French President Francois Mitterrand has threatened to ask the painful 
question of why NATO, which promised to intervene to prevent the 
"strangulation" of Sarajevo, has done nothing while Serbian forces have stepped 
up their shelling of civilian neighborhoods in the Bosnian capital. 
</P>
<P>
 In Russia, Clinton has a politically delicate task: explaining to leaders and 
citizens that the United States accepts Russian nationalism -- but not the 
xenophobic, aggressive nationalism of Zhirinovsky, who has threatened to 
reconquer the lost lands of the Soviet Union; and pushing for continued 
economic reforms, while promising more Western attention to the idea of a 
"social safety net" to cushion the impact of closing huge, inefficient 
state-owned industries. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a different Moscow than the one Clinton originally planned to visit," 
said Dmitri Simes of Washington's Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. 
"Originally, he thought he would come in triumph on the heels of a Yeltsin 
victory in the parliamentary election." 
</P>
<P>
 Aides say Clinton plans to make the limits of Western tolerance clear by 
refusing to meet with Zhirinovsky and by warning against xenophobia in a speech 
he is scheduled to give on Moscow television. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also hopes to strike a sympathetic note. "They should be given the 
opportunity to develop a new sense of their national purpose that is not 
aggressive and that permits them to be part of an integrated European 
political, economic and strategic system," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Moscow and Minsk, Clinton hopes to move forward in dismantling the 
remaining nuclear weapons of the former Soviet republics. The stop in Belarus 
is meant to reward that new nation for its willingness to surrender its atomic 
weapons to Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real issue is Ukraine, which has about 1,800 nuclear warheads and has 
resisted making a commitment to give them all up. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has offered hundreds of millions of dollars in economic aid 
as an incentive. Officials hope Ukrainian President Leonid Kravchuk will agree 
to sign a deal at a three-way summit session with Clinton and Yeltsin in 
Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in Geneva one week from today, Clinton is scheduled to meet with 
Syrian President Hafez Assad in an attempt to give a boost to Middle East peace 
negotiations. Israel has reached basic peace agreements with the Palestine 
Liberation Organization and Jordan. But Assad, who has demanded total Israeli 
withdrawal from the Golan Heights, has yet to signal readiness for a 
compromise.

SOME INDIAN TOWNS REJECT MEXICO REBELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Mexican troops marched into Chanal, the last rebel-held town, last week 
after overcoming a token defense by Indian guerrillas on the outskirts, 
villagers proudly handed them 14 rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 The soldiers were not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of San Juan Chamula had also turned over a captured guerrilla to the 
government, and in Oxchuc citizens had pleaded with the army to come get 14 
rebels they had captured -- and allegedly stoned. 
</P>
<P>
 All three Indian towns came down firmly on the side of the government and 
against the guerrillas, whose avowed purpose is to fight for the rights of 
indigenous people. 
</P>
<P>
 The government claims that their actions showed the lack of Indian support for 
the armed movement. 
</P>
<P>
 But researchers and human rights activists who know the area say reasons could 
range from fear of reprisals to a traditional conflict between the residents of 
county seats and the more impoverished rebels living in the hills surrounding 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rebels are not all of the Indians, or even a majority," said Richard Nye, 
an anthropologist who has lived in the area for 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those participating in the movement are the most radical line of one position 
taken by the Indians: The only way to force political change is revolution," he 
said. "This has not been accepted by a majority, although all are sympathetic 
to their demands." 
</P>
<P>
 Although other Indian groups may be sympathetic, they are not willing to risk 
their own communities for a group of strangers, said Susanna Paisley, 
development coordinator at Casa Na Bolom, a research center here for Indian 
cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chamula asked for federal troops to come guard their city so there 
wouldn't be any question about what side they are on," said Will Hoffman, 
cultural projects coordinator at Na Bolom. "They know what could happen if they 
get caught in the middle." 
</P>
<P>
 An Interior Ministry report released Friday repeats the government's 
insistence that peasants were pressured into participating and that the rebels 
have little grass-roots support. And President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has 
said he will consider pardons for peasants who were tricked into joining the 
rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peasant recruits have told us that there have been cases where children were 
taken hostage to gain their parents' participation," the report stated. Others 
were said to have been threatened with expulsion from their communities if they 
did not participate. 
</P>
<P>
 The strongest rejection of the guerrillas was in Oxchuc, where captured rebels 
told reporters that they were stoned and beaten. 
</P>
<P>
 "They burned our buildings," one villager, a heavyset man who would not reveal 
his name, explained as he gestured toward the gutted frames of modest 
concrete-block buildings that were once municipal offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxchuc residents were shocked that international media had portrayed them as 
savages for their treatment of the prisoners. The day after the incident, 
Oxchuc leaders were on the second floor of the village gazebo, watching for 
reporters and telling residents over the public address system not to talk with 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from half a dozen Indian communities attended a news conference 
apparently staged by the government to express their opposition to the 
guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
 And many villagers did not blame the Salinas administration for failing to 
send immediate help when they were under siege. 
</P>
<P>
 "We understand that our government has limited resources," one Oxchuc leader 
said. "The problem is you foreigners who come here bringing trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 So it came as little surprise that local leaders decided to turn in the 
guerrillas, who are mainly from the hillsides, one rights activist said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in the county seats are more or less contented and accepting of their 
lot," he said. "It is in the outlying areas that conditions are most extreme." 
</P>
<P>
 Bases are in remote areas that can be reached only after three- or four-hour 
journeys over hidden trails through dense vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
 It is in these remote areas that the guerrillas have actively recruited, 
according to government reports. And that is where their support runs deep. 
</P>
<P>
 In the guerrilla strongholds, women, old people and children provide support 
systems from food and money to transporting arms and providing lookouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The group gradually transforms the dynamics of communities under their 
control," the government report stated. "All productive activity is practically 
paralyzed, and municipal activities, including education, are neglected."

RIORDAN'S ENERGETIC AGENDA FACES ITS TOUGHEST CHALLENGE; CITY HALL: DESPITE 
GAINS, ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT REMAINS ELUSIVE. MAYOR SAYS HE HAS LAID GROUNDWORK 
FOR CHANGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH CONNELL and JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When he took the oath of office, Richard Riordan carried a promise of renewal 
for "a city in need of safety and economic opportunity . . . a city desperate 
for hope." At the six-month mark of his tenure, the mayor of Los Angeles is 
winning praise for strides on the first and last themes. 
</P>
<P>
 In a bleak period of budget retreat, Riordan managed to scrape together the 
down payment on an ambitious crime-fighting plan that could noticeably increase 
the number of officers on the beat by summer. And many observers say that the 
mayor's energetic agenda and expressions of hope have helped revive 
expectations that the city's future can be brighter than its recent past. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the turn of the year, interviews show, there is also a growing sense 
that the new mayor must pick up the pace on his inaugural's most difficult 
theme: stimulating job creation and business opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has changed the chemistry and changed the dynamic in the community," said 
Los Angeles political consultant Rich Lichtenstein, who often represents 
business interests at City Hall. "Now he has to take some substantial 
initiatives to get some economic turnaround . . . or he will lose the 
momentum." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not hearing from them a clear sense of what jobs they're looking for (or) 
what they are looking for (generally) in terms of economic development," said 
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter, who heads a key committee that oversees the city's 
business-oriented agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh from a skiing vacation in the Idaho Rockies, where he could savor early 
successes, Riordan has returned to the dark-paneled reality of City Hall and 
the enormous challenges ahead. Chief among them is devising a politically 
viable, balanced budget and freeing up nearly $100 million more for the second 
phase of his five-year effort to expand the LAPD by 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Riordan was upbeat about the progress he has made and the 
prospects for working through the difficult issues ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main thing I'm proud of is the people I've brought here," he said. "It's 
like building a building. You first hire an architect. You then put up a 
foundation, and you don't see too much. Then all of a sudden, within a few 
days, you put up the superstructure and people see significantly more than they 
have seen for the last year." 
</P>
<P>
 The legacy of this Administration, many analysts and elected officials 
believe, will be written more in the coming six months than in the last. 
Looming for Riordan are defining battles over new union contracts, whether 
private firms should provide some public services, and a controversial effort 
to tap into funds going to a large Department of Water and Power workers 
pension fund. And financing Riordan's police buildup could require unpopular 
cuts in other services such as libraries and parks, some officials believe. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome will turn in large part on how effectively the mayor exploits the 
new chemistry he has fostered, and how he builds on the initial policy advances 
he has won. 
</P>
<P>
 Implementing Riordan's core agenda -- curbing street violence, creating jobs 
and streamlining government -- hinges on the uncertain willingness of the City 
Council to go along with his initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, Riordan has invested heavily in the politics of schmooze and 
nurturing personal ties with council members. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the often aloof, enigmatic former mayor, Tom Bradley, Riordan 
has injected a new gregariousness into the City Hall political equation. He has 
invited the entire council over to his house for dinner, played golf or ridden 
mountain bikes with council members, and attended public "Meet the Mayor" 
sessions with them from one end of the city to the other. He calls often and, 
in a reflection of the new equanimity, sometimes wanders into a council 
member's office for a chat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just my style," Riordan said. "I'm comfortable. . . . I'm learning a lot 
by talking to them." 
</P>
<P>
 When Galanter let it be known that she was "really miffed" with the mayor's 
office a few months back, three calls came in quick succession from Riordan and 
two lieutenants. The issue now escapes her, she said, but not the response. 
"The mayor's operation was very careful to try to repair that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 What all the attentiveness and political courtesy buys Riordan is unclear. 
Members have shown a willingness to deal the new mayor embarrassing defeats -- 
such as spiking a fund-raising scheme that would have transferred title of the 
historic Central Library to a tobacco company affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan advisers concede that they still have no natural, reliable council 
majority. They plan to hunt down votes one by one, issue by issue. But Riordan 
Chief of Staff William McCarley said he is "optimistic we'll be able to 
generate enough support to get a large part of Riordan's program" implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan agreed. "Generally, I think the one thing I have going is that 
virtually all of the City Council trusts me." 
</P>
<P>
 But with so much of Riordan's financial and City Hall restructuring plans 
still unknown, even to top mayoral advisers, others are more cautious. One 
mayoral adviser privately described the police funding and deficit problems as 
"the big engine coming down the tracks at us." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many say Riordan's personal demeanor, his political popularity and a 
general feeling that the city must be moved beyond riots and recession are 
playing in the mayor's favor. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has people pulling for him because they feel that his success will become 
their success," said Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, the city's budget expert. "The 
council feels we have nothing to gain by scoring political points." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether he is appearing on national news interview programs or taping an 
introduction for a sports bloopers television show, Riordan has reached out to 
a varied audience. 
</P>
<P>
 The 63-year-old millionaire mayor has been a voice of tireless optimism, 
sometimes expressed in the unpolished manner of a neophyte politician. He also 
has demonstrated an appetite for unconventional thinking -- science fiction 
master Ray Bradbury recently brainstormed with Riordan about transportation and 
city planning issues. Some observers say those characteristics have come 
through in his public persona and seem to have struck a chord with much of the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's saying the basic truth: That L.A. is not doomed . . . (it's) going to 
turn around," said Joel Kotkin, a senior fellow at the Center for the New West, 
a public policy think tank. "He's saying it's a city with problems, but a city 
with huge promise." 
</P>
<P>
 What has been conspicuously lagging, Kotkin and others say, is a cleareyed 
scheme for attacking the malignancy of high inner-city unemployment, 
middle-class job losses and rebuilding an economy battered by defense cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm certainly waiting for the type of jobs he has envisioned for unemployment 
problems," said Mark Whitlock, who directs an economic development program 
associated with the First African Methodist Episcopal Church in Los Angeles. 
"And I'd like to see a candid discussion of what the Administration's vision is 
for rebuilding South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem's been around for the last 30 years, so I can't say six months is 
too (long). But I don't think we can afford to wait another six months." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said that realistically, economic help for inner-city residents may 
have to come in the form of jobs located elsewhere, and transportation 
improvements to carry workers there. "Those businesses can be anywhere in the 
city," he said. "I think somehow RLA and everything concentrated too much on 
where the jobs were created, as opposed to the goal of the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Some City Hall and Administration sources say that Riordan was set back by the 
rocky tenure of Alfred Villalobos, his deputy mayor for economic development 
who resigned last month after a series of disclosures about a checkered 
business past. Riordan aides say it will be weeks before a new economic 
development czar is in place. 
</P>
<P>
 But McCarley, the mayor's chief of staff, denied that Villalobos' service or 
departure delayed the mayor's economic planning. He said it is unrealistic to 
expect a full-blown economic development plan so soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the most difficult, least defined and hardest area to have an impact 
on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan said he is leery of producing a huge plan that raises false 
expectations. "I'm not a bull artist. When you start talking about magic 
bullets you're giving people an impression of doing much more than you're 
capable of doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Riordan economic program to turn L.A. around is to make it safe and 
friendly. Business is going to go where it's in their self-interest to go," the 
mayor said. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of studies are under way to determine how best to leverage state and 
local federal funding to help small businesses, and how to improve the 
transportation system to get the unemployed to areas where jobs are more 
readily available, McCarley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan and his aides emphasized that the mayor has made calls to deter 
individual businesses from leaving Los Angeles, including Packard Bell, a 
computer company in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 George Mihlsten, a prominent Downtown lawyer, said Riordan contacted two of 
his clients -- whom he declined to identify -- and aides followed up 
aggressively in an effort to keep the companies and several thousand employees 
in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time in the history of the city, the mayor's office is going 
out and aggressively pursuing companies that are thinking of leaving," Mihlsten 
said. "This is a major change for the city of Los Angeles, to begin acting like 
other cities and competing for employers and jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan has also appointed a new Administration official charged with making 
it easier for the film industry to remain in the city. And a committee of 
heavyweight developers is drawing up a plan for reducing paperwork and delays 
for new construction projects. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been signs of a new business acumen and agility in the Riordan 
Administration. They include the much-publicized standoff with the airlines 
over higher Los Angeles International Airport landing fees, a hard-nosed 
renegotiation of a huge Alameda Corridor transportation deal and, with unusual 
speed, putting together a deal for a new police training and communications 
facility that will save $50 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In an early, bitter showdown with the airline industry, the Administration won 
a key legal and political victory that will permit the collection of tens of 
millions of dollars in new levies. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, Riordan and his harbor commissioners tossed out a previously 
negotiated, $260-million Bradley Administration agreement to purchase Southern 
Pacific railroad rights of way. The rights of way are crucial to a huge, harbor 
to Downtown shipping corridor that will create thousands of jobs and relieve 
congestion and delays. 
</P>
<P>
 By December, the purchase price had been renegotiated to $240 million and 
Riordan estimated that the agreement shaved about $80 million off the overall 
costs faced by the Los Angeles and Long Beach ports. 
</P>
<P>
 The full savings is impossible to know until the $1.3-billion project is 
completed, but even Southern Pacific's attorney, Tom Houston, grudgingly 
concedes that the new Administration cut a better deal for itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The savings were clearer on the recent Police Academy deal -- the sort of 
multimillion-dollar opportunity the businessman in Riordan understood. 
</P>
<P>
 After years spent studying construction of a facility in Sylmar, the LAPD was 
approached by a young real estate agent with a cheap and speedy alternative -- 
a modern, 14-acre campus-like corporate training facility in Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD quickly deemed the site ideal, but other bidders were making offers 
for the complex, and City Hall's lumbering bureaucracy would have to move 
quickly or the deal could be gone. 
</P>
<P>
 At the initiation of Galanter, who represents Westchester, Riordan was given 
unusual negotiating authority by the City Council and went into deal-making 
mode. He called up the corporate officials who were selling the property to 
secure the city time to make a bid. Then he reached outside City Hall to 
volunteer attorneys and real estate experts who could quickly analyze and 
negotiate a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven days later, city officials were counting up $50 million in estimated 
savings and planning to begin the first classes at the new facility in a few 
months -- more than two years sooner than once anticipated. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the $13-million Police Academy deal has been widely applauded, it 
also highlights a recurring concern about the new Administration. As Riordan 
relies on experts in the private sector to help conduct important city 
business, opportunities for conflicts of interest grow and the outer limits of 
ethics regulations are being tested. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been no indication of impropriety, but the attorneys and real estate 
developer brought in to the Police Academy deal were not covered by normal 
conflict-of-interest disclosure rules for city officials who negotiate such 
contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Political scholar Xandra Kayden, past executive director of the commission 
that drafted the city's ethics laws, said such arrangements can be beneficial, 
but also pose risks. "The main priority of government is not to be efficient," 
she said. "The main job of government is to be fair. And that's where you can't 
be sure when things are moving so quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan advisers say the mayor did what just he was elected to do -- save 
taxpayers millions of dollars and use his business skills to make government 
more responsive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this was the mayor at his finest," McCarley said. "He was experienced 
. . . he was able to strip away the bureaucratic delays. This was his element." 
In Mayor's Own Words: A Look Back and Ahead 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Friday with The Times, Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan 
discussed his first six months in office and what lies ahead. Here are some 
excerpts: 
</P>
<P>
 Accomplishments: We've just got an incredible group of people together. And 
that means both full time plus volunteers who have spent hundreds, sometimes 
over a 1,000 hours, working for the city. The planning, the hard work that has 
been put in, the change in culture which is starting to seep through the city. 
Obviously, Project Safety Los Angeles is a good thing. It's the first time, I 
think, in the United States that anyone has had a long-term strategic plan in 
making major changes in the Police Department. Within five years, starting last 
July 1, it will increase the number of police in community-based policing and 
on the streets five times. 
</P>
<P>
 Budget Battles Ahead: We have to find the money (for police) because we 
absolutely do not have a choice. If you don't make the city safe, the tax base 
is going to shrink and you'll have less money to do anything. The obvious 
places to look are some of the proprietary departments, such as DWP, the 
airport, harbor, public works in the long run. You can't go much further on 
some of the libraries (and) parks. You can't cut them anymore. (He declined to 
discuss details of his upcoming budget balancing plan.) 
</P>
<P>
 Economic Development: We're working with the state and federal governments, 
working to set up community banks, to set up a bunch of capital pools. We're 
working very closely with the (federal) government on setting up an empowerment 
zone. By the same token, all those things put together are just frosting on the 
cake. People don't want to move businesses into a war zone. They don't want to 
be in a city that has been just incredibly unfriendly to business, particularly 
small business. And that's where you are going to turn this city around 
economically. Once you have improved the infrastructure for business, it will 
just pour in here out of self-interest. 
</P>
<P>
 And (we must) build on our strength: the entertainment industry. If we could 
increase the number of pictures produced in L.A. 10% over the next year, it 
would be the same as bringing in several hundred small companies. (In the) long 
run, you're not going to get major manufacturing operations that are labor 
intensive into the city of L.A. You need high-tech jobs that are not as labor 
intensive. A lot of the biomedical, electronics, things like that. 
</P>
<P>
 Conditions in South-Central Los Angeles: I've tried to step back and say what 
can we do better or differently, and the one thing I've come to a conclusion on 
is the ultimate goal has got to be jobs in the inner city. And the way you get 
jobs, obviously, is you have business that will hire you. And that business can 
be anywhere in the city, provided that they are willing to hire people from the 
inner city or any place else in the city. I think somehow RLA and everything 
concentrated too much on where the jobs were created, as opposed to the goal of 
the job. First, you have to encourage business to hire people from all parts of 
the city. Secondly, people have to have access and transportation to and from 
the jobs, which they don't have today in many cases. And third, they have to 
have the tools to do a good job, such as a good education, which in many cases 
they don't have. We are working on all those very hard. I've been after 
improved busing. And education, that's been my whole life. Sizing Up the Mayor 
</P>
<P>
 A sampling of views on the performance of Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has had an extraordinarily long honeymoon. In large part that is because 
people don't think he is in it for himself. They see him giving his time . . . 
to help the city." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone accepts that he has had some victories and he is serious about the 
issue of crime. Now it's time to use his honeymoon to accomplish some other 
things on economic development and on privatization." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Nick Patsaouras, a candidate in last year's mayoral primary. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "He has been able to do a better job in a lot of ways with the council than 
Mike Woo would have. Mike would have brought a lot of history with him and 
Riordan has been able to say, 'I don't have the history, let's get going.' " 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lawyer and lobbyist Douglas Ring. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Our community, more than any other, lives with crime and violence. The fact 
that public safety is No. 1 on his agenda every day really strikes a chord. And 
his close relationship with (Police Chief) Willie Williams is well received." 
</P>
<P>
 -- African American political consultant Kerman Maddox. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "He has to come out and articulate a vision of the economic future of Los 
Angeles. He has not done that yet." 
</P>

NEWS ANALYSIS; CHINA'S MOTIVES IN NORTH KOREAN CRISIS DEBATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MANN and RONE TEMPEST, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is China helping the United States stop North Korea from developing nuclear 
weapons? Or, as some U.S. critics charge, is China using the North Korean 
crisis for its own benefit, to demonstrate to the world its importance in Asia? 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past few months, as the Clinton Administration has strived to scuttle 
a suspected North Korean nuclear weapons program, it has found that all roads 
to a solution lead through China. Not only does Beijing have veto power on the 
U.N. Security Council, it would be the key nation in determining whether an 
economic embargo against North Korea would work. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher has characterized China's role as vital 
in reaching a North Korean settlement. Other senior Administration officials 
have acknowledged that the secret diplomatic contacts with and through Beijing 
have been "intensive" throughout the dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet if Beijing's role is important, it is also controversial, because some 
critics claim that China has been nursing along the North Korean issue to gain 
diplomatic leverage over the United States and to show the Clinton 
Administration how much it needs good relations with Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 "China has played such an irresponsible and dangerous game on this," said 
Nicholas Eberstadt, a North Korea specialist at the American Enterprise 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, at least, China's role is full of contradictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinese officials insist that they have little influence over North Korean 
President Kim Il Sung -- and in political terms, that may be true. Yet in 
economic terms, China would appear to have considerable leverage. According to 
South Korean statistics, North Korea obtained 75% of its grain, 72% of its 
crude oil and 88% of its coking coal from China in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In its public statements, China regularly says that it does not want North 
Korea to obtain nuclear weapons. Beijing does not relish the idea of an 
unpredictable new nuclear power on its borders, and it fears such an emergence 
could prompt South Korea and Japan to counter with their own nuclear weapons 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials and independent analysts believe China's 
opposition is sincere. 
</P>
<P>
 But Beijing also has repeatedly opposed any economic embargo that would apply 
pressure on Pyongyang. "The operational question is, what would China do to 
prevent North Korea from obtaining nuclear weapons?" one U.S. official said. 
"The answer is, not much." 
</P>
<P>
 China's importance in arranging a North Korean settlement poses awkward, 
indeed scary, dilemmas for U.S. policy-makers, problems that have been quietly 
debated in Washington for months. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you go with an embargo (against North Korea), you would have to get the 
Chinese to go along," said Rep. Gary L. Ackerman (D-N.Y.), chairman of the 
House Foreign Affairs subcommittee on Asia. "But there would be a price to pay. 
The Chinese would not do this for free. Do we want to be bound to look the 
other way on human rights and most-favored-nation (trade status) for China? Or, 
alternatively, if the United States did this (embargo) without the Chinese, 
what if the Chinese decided to ship oil through a naval blockade? Would we sink 
a Chinese ship?" 
</P>
<P>
 During the Korean War and for decades after that, Chinese officials used the 
same graphic expression to characterize their relationship with North Korea: 
The two countries, they said, were as close as "lips and teeth." 
</P>
<P>
 But even in its best days, the alliance between Beijing and Pyongyang was 
never really that solid. Kim, the North Korean leader, was extremely adept at 
playing China against the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 And recently, since the Soviet Union's collapse, ties between Beijing and 
Pyongyang have deteriorated. To North Korea's irritation, China began asking 
for cash payments at market prices for oil and other products. The change in 
policy hurt the already impoverished North Korean economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Even worse, in North Korea's view, China established diplomatic relations with 
South Korea, Pyongyang's perennial enemy. In a 1990 trip to the Chinese city of 
Shenyang in Manchuria, Kim reportedly met in secret with Chinese leader Deng 
Xiaoping in a frosty, unsuccessful effort to head off normalization between 
Beijing and Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
 A Chinese official in Beijing contended last week that China was not and 
should not be "directly involved" in the North Korean nuclear dispute. Still, 
he said, China has "repeatedly made use of every opportunity and channel" over 
the past year to tell North Korea that it should not develop nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would not support the emergence of nuclear weapons on the Korean 
peninsula," the official said. "But to be honest with you, China does not know 
whether they have the nuclear bomb or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Chinese official argued against international efforts to impose an 
embargo on North Korea. "I've had a lot of contact with the Koreans," he said. 
"They want very much to sit together with the big powers on an equal footing. 
If dialogue is on an unequal footing or sanctions are tried, it would obviously 
result in hurting their national pride, and this is something they would not 
accept." 
</P>
<P>
 Beijing appears to be remarkably content to let the United States carry out 
negotiations with North Korea, thus having America play the lead role in what 
is supposed to be China's main sphere of influence. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Bush, a Democratic congressional staff member who specializes in Asian 
affairs, suggested that China may be letting the United States take the lead 
with North Korea for now, realizing that the tough job of persuasion or 
pressure may fall to China later on. 
</P>
<P>
 "The possibility or probability that China might abstain on a sanctions 
resolution has influence over North Korea," Bush said. "That would represent 
repudiation of them (North Korea) on a global basis, even by those who were 
their friends, and would render them totally isolated in the eyes of the 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, senior Clinton Administration officials emphasize that in 
private talks, China has not ruled out the possibility of supporting an 
economic embargo against North Korea in the future. "This is, right now, a 
hypothetical issue, and we have not pressed them to make a decision on a 
hypothetical," a top Administration policy-maker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some Administration critics, including former officials of the George 
Bush Administration, say that the United States should be pressing China harder 
to support an embargo or other tough measures against North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time for us to push them (China)," said James R. Lilley, who served as 
U.S. ambassador to Beijing and later as a top Pentagon official under Bush. 
"You've got to get the Chinese in a position where they lose more than they 
gain. If China doesn't play ball, you've got to look at the possibility of 
limiting the transfer of high technology to China or of having Japan cut back 
on soft loans to China." 
</P>
<P>
 That sort of pressure from the West is exactly what China is trying to avoid. 
"We don't want to get caught in the middle of this," said a Chinese official 
working outside China. "When we established relations with South Korea, what 
could the North Koreans do except scream at us? This dispute isn't like that. 
These (nuclear installations) are facilities on their own territory. What are 
we supposed to do, go in there (and remove them)?" 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past six months, the need for China's help in the North Korean 
nuclear dispute has become the top priority for the Administration as it seeks 
to improve troubled U.S. relations with Beijing. Human rights advocates worry 
that the North Korean issue could cause the Administration to hold back on its 
criticisms of repression in China. 
</P>
<P>
 But a senior Administration official said China has never tried directly to 
get concessions from the United States in exchange for its assistance in 
stopping the North Korean nuclear program. "There is not the faintest 
indication that they (China) are using this issue for leverage over us," the 
official said.

SAN DIEGO FIRM PROVING GROUND FOR DEFENSE POSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD A. SERRANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the likely elevation of Bobby Ray Inman to secretary of defense, an 
innovative, employee-owned company specializing in military contracts will find 
itself with some of the most powerful connections Washington has to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming he is confirmed by the Senate, Inman will become the fourth member of 
the board of directors of Science Applications International Corp. to get a top 
Pentagon post within the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Since last spring, two other board members have become deputy and assistant 
defense secretaries, while a third was tapped as a contracting deputy and is 
responsible for monitoring contracts between the government and private firms. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego-based firm's close ties to the new Pentagon leadership 
illustrate the extremely tight web of relationships inside the modern 
military-industrial complex, where defense experts frequently move back and 
forth between the public and private sectors. 
</P>
<P>
 But even by those standards, the connection between Science Applications and 
the federal government is extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Modzelewski, a defense analyst with PaineWebber Inc. in New York, said he 
knows of no other defense contractor with so many former board members now 
inside the Pentagon hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like they're a good training ground" for future government service, 
he said of the firm. "It looks like they are something you need on your 
resume." 
</P>
<P>
 Some defense analysts attributed the elevation of Science Applications 
directors to the company's status as a premier defense research firm, noting 
that the 16,000-employee organization has more government contracts -- 4,000 -- 
than any other firm in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 With its reputation for aggressiveness and innovation, their argument goes, it 
is only logical that the company should attract some of the industry's best and 
brightest -- who also would be strong candidates for top Defense Department 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 But others contended that, given the potential for conflicts of interest -- or 
even the appearance of such conflicts -- the unusually powerful relationship 
bears watching. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're obviously a very influential company and they're a far-reaching 
company," said Keith Rutter, assistant director of the Project on Government 
Oversight, a Washington public-interest group. "They have a lot of political 
influence." 
</P>
<P>
 Rutter and other government and defense analysts said that since members of 
the firm's board have begun arriving so recently and because Inman's nomination 
is still being considered, it is too early to tell how the relationships will 
be perceived -- or what, if anything, they will mean for the company or the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 But they also said that Inman's directorship with Science Applications will 
likely be a subject of discussion during his confirmation hearings, which begin 
Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Inman has said he would not comment about any defense-related issues until 
after the confirmation process. Likewise, Pentagon administrators were reticent 
to discuss the relationship between the Defense Department and the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to decline to comment on this," said Capt. Michael Doubleday, a 
Pentagon spokesman. "I don't think that we would have anything that would be 
meaningful to say." 
</P>
<P>
 The company's ties to Washington are indeed impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Inman, a board member for 12 years, was nominated last month by President 
Clinton to run the Pentagon. A retired Navy admiral, he headed the National 
Security Agency under President Jimmy Carter and served as deputy director of 
the CIA under President Ronald Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 At Science Applications, he has chaired the board's executive committee. He is 
expected to tender his resignation when his Pentagon appointment is confirmed 
by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 * William J. Perry was a board member of the firm for six years before he was 
tapped last year to join the Pentagon in the No. 2 slot as deputy secretary of 
defense. He was considered a candidate for the top job before Clinton chose 
Inman to succeed Defense Secretary Les Aspin. 
</P>
<P>
 * John M. Deutch was a board member for 13 years but left Science Applications 
to become undersecretary of defense for acquisition and technology. 
</P>
<P>
 In that role, he has developed a high public profile for his work researching 
the causes of the mysterious post-Persian Gulf War maladies reported by men and 
women who served in the conflict and for renegotiating the contract for 
development of the troubled C-17 cargo plane. 
</P>
<P>
 * Anita K. Jones, a board member for six years and former professor and 
chairwoman of the Department of Computer Science at the University of Virginia, 
serves as a contracting deputy at the Pentagon under Deutch. She reviews 
defense contracts to assure that private companies meet Pentagon standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry, Deutch and Jones, who have long been considered experts in the defense 
field, were nominated by the White House and came to the Pentagon to serve 
under Aspin. They have been considered key players in his attempts to retool 
the military at the end of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 Under government procurement rules, Science Applications will not be precluded 
from continuing to bid for military contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 While the company's connections could gain it preferred treatment in the 
awarding of highly lucrative contracts, Inman and the other former Science 
Applications directors at the Pentagon could find themselves under so much 
pressure not to show favoritism that the relationship ultimately could do the 
firm harm, company officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Albrecht, Science Applications' senior vice president for government 
relations in Washington, suggested that the company actually could lose some 
defense work because the new Pentagon leaders will be "bending over backwards" 
to show there are no conflicts of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very mixed blessing," he said. "On the one hand, we are very proud to 
have people associated with our company that are so attracted to the 
Administration, and at the same time know our company well." 
</P>
<P>
 But he predicted that because of the unique relationship, Inman, Perry and the 
others will use an "abundance of caution" in any future dealings with Science 
Applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenz A. Kull, the company's president and chief operating officer, agreed, 
pledging that the firm will be careful about not expecting special treatment or 
drifting into appearances of conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "To quote a familiar phrase," he said, "the Queen of England must not only be 
virtuous but she also must be perceived to be virtuous." 
</P>
<P>
 But an official from another defense contracting firm, who asked not to be 
identified, said that because Science Applications is one of the premier 
research and development firms in the nation, it would be a loss to the 
government if they are excluded from future Pentagon work. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the specialized areas of research houses, they have a dominant position," 
he said. "I'm not sure who could up them in this field, irrespective of what 
their situation is with who is at the top of the Pentagon administration." 
</P>
<P>
 While it remains to be seen what if anything will come of the current ties 
between Science Applications and the Pentagon, it is unclear whether special 
connections were any help to company officials two years ago, when the firm was 
charged with falsifying the results of test samples taken from Superfund 
hazardous waste sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The case, which erupted in 1991 and before the latest company board members 
went to Washington, became what one prosecutor called "the largest 
environmental fraud fine we've had here." 
</P>
<P>
 During the investigation, Melvin R. Laird, another board director and a former 
secretary of defense, wrote a letter to then-Atty. Gen. Dick Thornburgh, asking 
him to delay the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 In his hand-delivered letter marked "personal," Laird wrote that "there was no 
wrongdoing on the part of the corporation." He went on to mention that 
"President (George) Bush recently recognized three of our directors" with 
appointments to the President's Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board, a 
six-member group that evaluates work by U.S. intelligence agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 The three were Inman, Perry and Deutch. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (Laird) was trying to tell the Justice Department that we were not a bunch 
of crooks, that they were dealing with ethical people," Kull said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, in a settlement agreement in U.S. District Court here, the company 
pleaded guilty to seven counts of making false statements to the Environmental 
Protection Agency and three counts of making false claims for payment. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were taking in more samples than they could do," said Melanie K. 
Pierson, the assistant U.S. attorney who prosecuted the case. "They were more 
interested in money than they were in health and safety concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 Six employees were terminated after an internal investigation by the company 
found that no senior managers were involved in the scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the company was ordered to pay $1.3 million in restitution and 
penalties. In announcing the heavy fine, federal Judge Rudi M. Brewster called 
the episode an example of "corporate greed" and said he wanted to make sure the 
company accepted its share of the blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this going to be a situation where the (employees) were, in a sense, 
victims of the corporate greed? I don't know any other way to describe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Kull acknowledged that the whole episode was a grave mistake. "It was an 
absolute embarrassment," he said. "It was not a good time for us." 
</P>
<P>
 But the episode appears to have been the only public blemish on the company's 
otherwise successful record. 
</P>
<P>
 Science Applications was founded 25 years and today, about 91% of its work is 
in federal government contracts. But base closings and defense conversion have 
had a sharp impact on the firm's military work. Eight years ago, 68% of its 
work was in defense and national security fields. That figure is now down to 
51%. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, company revenues are predicted at $1.5 billion this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has taken on a number of non-defense contracts, such as developing 
automated highway toll booths in California and Florida. Other projects have 
included new technology for fossil fuels, systems to monitor pollutants on the 
ocean floor and programs to turn air pollution into fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's most ambitious defense project, begun in 1986, is the $1-billion 
program to computerize the medical records at all 700 of the military hospitals 
and health clinics around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 John H. Warner, executive vice president and a board director, predicted that 
the new military hospital computer system, just two years from completion, 
eventually will save taxpayers up to $2.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Company technicians are also providing rugged, battle-ready laptop computers 
for the Army and Marine Corps. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials said they have so many government contracts because, unlike 
most other contractors, they bid on almost every research and technological 
project that is proposed by defense, environmental and other federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're always trying to diversify and become more balanced in our work with 
the federal government," Albrecht said.

DELAYED VICTORY; MARINE WINS 2-YEAR BATTLE WITH U.S. OVER INJURIES SUFFERED IN 
GULF WAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Brett Doggett has just won his second battle. 
</P>
<P>
 The first occurred in the Persian Gulf War, where the 26-year-old Marine 
corporal stepped on a land mine and lost his left foot and the big toe of his 
right foot. The second came in his two-year battle with the Department of 
Veterans Affairs for recognition that his injury was serious enough to warrant 
full financial compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 The government recently relented, but only after hundreds of phone calls, 
dozens of letters, and thousands of traveled miles, including one trip to 
Washington, where Doggett, accompanied by a congressman, removed his shoes and 
socks to show government officials the stump of his toe. Then he hobbled back 
and forth on the floor in front of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was so they could see how unsteady he was," said Susan Doggett, Brett's 
wife of two years, who contacted him in the wake of the national publicity when 
he returned as a wounded Marine. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago when Doggett filed his claim, the Department of Veterans Affairs 
awarded him a pension of $742 a month, about 60% of the amount possible. They 
later increased it to 80% in recognition of his traumatic stress syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 Doggett protested at every turn, insisting that his disability was complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Veterans affairs officials say that the department's initial decision to award 
Doggett less than 100% disability was the best one possible based on the 
medical evidence available at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "He added to his disabilities as the claim progressed," said Chris Allen, 
assistant adjudication officer in the Los Angeles office where the decision was 
made. "It was a judgment call." 
</P>
<P>
 For Doggett, who lives in Orange, the ordeal began March 3, 1991, just four 
days after President George Bush had declared victory in the confrontation with 
Iraq. A light-armored vehicle gunner in Kuwait, Doggett had left his post 
momentarily to get a cup of hot chocolate when an officer ordered him to lead a 
foot patrol in search of snipers. 
</P>
<P>
 Doggett said he was walking past a smelly chicken coop near an old well when a 
land mine exploded and ripped through his lower extremities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked down and the left front of my boot was missing completely and the 
right boot was peeled back like a can," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosthesis on his amputated foot makes that leg 1 1/4 inches longer than 
the other, which has resulted in a painful back condition. He also gets chronic 
skin rashes, which he blames on the poisonous chemicals he believes he was 
exposed to. He also suffers from post traumatic stress syndrome, which keeps 
him tossing and turning almost every night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't even sleep in the same bed because I'm afraid that he'll kick real 
hard and hurt me," Susan Doggett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Able only to walk slowly with a cane, the former Marine -- who used to bowl, 
play tennis and jog seven miles a day -- finds it painful to sit or stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every wall in my house looks like a kid lives here because he has to lean on 
all the walls," Susan Doggett said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two years, the Doggetts have traveled countless times to Los 
Angeles and San Diego for medical documentation, and enlisted the aid of 
Disabled American Veterans as well as Rep. Edward R. Royce (R-Fullerton). 
</P>
<P>
 "This was an unusual circumstance," Royce said of his involvement in the case. 
"For Brett to get on with his life he needed to have this tug of war with the 
VA resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 Doggett's persistence culminated in his appearance last month before the board 
of veterans appeal in Washington where the injured veteran bared his wound and 
demonstrated his wobbly gait. 
</P>
<P>
 "That may very well have turned the decision," Allen said. "When you're 
dealing with physical disabilities, you have volumes and volumes of medical 
evidence to go through and there is a somewhat wide latitude for disagreement 
and judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to $2,312 a month for the rest of his life, Doggett will receive 
about $14,000 in retroactive payments dating to the beginning of his claim, 
Allen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Doggett, who is pursuing an undergraduate degree in political science at Cal 
State Fullerton, said he is happy to receive the money but the fight has left 
him disillusioned. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't take care of me the way they should have," he said. "I would 
think that if you are willing to risk your life or lose your body parts that 
they should be willing to give you the best care possible with the least amount 
of hassle." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor will the money compensate for his loss, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I ever wanted to be was an officer in the Marines," Doggett said. "I'm 
not that optimistic; what I really wanted to do in life I can't do anymore."

EX-PLAYER TRUMPETS NEGRO LEAGUES, BUT FEDS CRY FOUL; BASEBALL: LETTERS WRITTEN 
TO MAJOR LEAGUE OFFICIALS DEMANDING RECOGNITION WERE THREATENING, U.S. ATTORNEY 
SAYS. ASSOCIATES OF THE FORMER OUTFIELDER SAY HE IS ZEALOUS BUT HARMLESS.

 Sitting amid piles of correspondence and post-Christmas clutter, Alfred Henry 
was working diligently on another broadside against professional baseball when 
he heard a brusque knock on the door of his tiny condominium. 
</P>
<P>
 He got up slowly to open the door. 
</P>
<P>
 At 65, with a severe case of diabetes, a bad back and wrecked knees, Henry no 
longer moves with the speed and grace he displayed as an all-star football 
player in the Army and a baseball outfielder with the Baltimore Elite Giants in 
the Negro Leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 To his amazement, he found two FBI agents at the door. They had come to arrest 
him on a federal charge of sending threatening letters to officials of major 
league baseball, including Bud Selig, the acting commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 The agents read Henry his rights, handcuffed him behind his back and hauled 
him off to federal prison in San Diego, where he spent 24 hours before being 
released on New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Henry faces possible extradition to New York and charges that carry a 
maximum seven years in prison, all because of passages in five letters he wrote 
between May and December. 
</P>
<P>
 The letters upbraided baseball officials, accusing them of ignoring the 
historic contributions of the Negro Leagues and not doing enough for African 
American youth. They often finished with ominous-sounding warnings of violence 
brewing in urban America. 
</P>
<P>
 On May 20, he wrote Selig proposing a business venture and ended with a 
postscript: "When Peacefull overtures are exhausted Look-Out Violence." On July 
5, he wrote again to Selig with the parting shot: "It is unfortunate you 
mis-read me -- but life is choices!!! I will be your worst enemy." 
</P>
<P>
 His former minister says Henry is a harmless guy who likes to talk loud and 
does not know when to back down. A former Negro Leagues teammate says Henry is 
just a lonely and forgotten ex-jock who has gotten puffed up with 
self-importance. 
</P>
<P>
 But the U.S. attorney's office in New York takes a more sinister view of 
Henry's letters and has charged him with violating federal laws prohibiting the 
transmission of threats to the person, property or reputation of another. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry's lawyer, David Cohen, retorts that his client was just writing the 
truth as he sees it, that he never intended to harm anyone, and that his 
overheated prose, while rude and startling, is constitutionally protected 
political speech.

 "When you get kids 17 or 18, you can't do a damn thing with them," Henry said 
in a recent interview. "You got to teach them early at 7, 8 and 9, give them 
something to see, to do, to be proud of, so they won't go burning and looting. 
That's what I'm talking, an alternative. You understand?" 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, he wants young blacks to be told about the proud history 
of the Negro Leagues, which flourished when big-league baseball was for whites 
only. For a year he has been writing letters warning of violence if the Negro 
Leagues history is allowed to die. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry has used his home computer to write letters to major league baseball 
officials, the Upper Deck playing card company, Congressional Black Caucus, 
National Urban League and the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored 
People, among others. His prose is often tactless and angry. 
</P>
<P>
 To major league baseball, Henry offered sketchily drawn business proposals 
where he would supply hats and T-shirts commemorating the Negro Leagues in 
exchange for a cut of the profits. He requested money for an educational 
program and sports complex. 
</P>
<P>
 In September he wrote to the baseball executive in charge of marketing, 
Leonard Coleman, who is black: "When peacefull solutions do not occur -- then 
violence occurs. Will bloodstains be on Leonard Coleman's hands spring of 
1994???" 
</P>
<P>
 What prompted baseball officials to contact the FBI was a follow-up letter 
Henry sent to Coleman on Dec. 9, mentioning the rampage in which six people 
were killed on a Long Island commuter train two days earlier, allegedly by a 
black man who had a history of racial animosity. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry wrote: "May a word to the wise suffice. (Those killings were) not just a 
thrill-joy, but frustrations built up over a period of time!!" 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks later, Henry, who had never been arrested before, was behind bars. 
"We had a tragedy here Dec. 7," said Kate Cosenza, spokeswoman for the U.S. 
attorney in Manhattan, referring to the Long Island killings. "That should put 
this case in context." 
</P>
<P>
 Henry maintains that his arrest is just another example of American racism. 
"You got to get rid of a nigger with a brain," Henry said. "He's the worst 
enemy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Negro Leagues began in the 1920s and survived into the late 1950s. As more 
African American players joined the major leagues and attendance at Negro 
Leagues games fell, the leagues folded. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry's anger bubbled over just as major league baseball, after long ignoring 
the Negro Leagues, has begun making efforts to honor its heritage and assist 
the surviving players financially. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceremonies honoring the leagues have been held in several stadiums, and more 
are planned. Negro Leagues players have been invited to all-star and old-timer 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 A health plan was established by major league baseball for Negro Leagues 
players and their spouses. In December, a plan was announced to market a line 
of Negro Leagues memorabilia, with profits split among the Jackie Robinson 
Foundation, the Negro Leagues Baseball Museum in Kansas City, and Negro League 
veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 To Henry, those efforts have been too little, too late. He feels ripped off. 
He says he spent his own money to have a T-shirt and cap designed but was not 
included in the memorabilia plan. 
</P>
<P>
 He is particularly angry that the plan's profits will go only to players who 
played before 1947, the year Robinson joined the Brooklyn Dodgers and broke the 
color line. Henry's only season was 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Giants, Henry played a year in a Canadian league and then, racked by 
bad knees from a football injury, was forced to find another way to make a 
living. 
</P>
<P>
 He worked in a book bindery and then sold cars. He moved five years ago to 
this blue-collar suburb of San Diego. He lives on $1,200 a month in Army 
disability payments and Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a great guy, but sometimes his energies get misdirected," said the Rev. 
Julius R. Bennett, the pastor at Henry's former church. "He can be intolerant 
of people who disagree with him, but he's harmless."

ON CALIFORNIA: ALL ABOARD THE CRIME BANDWAGON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First came the criminal, the 16-time loser who took Polly Klaas from her 
Petaluma home at knifepoint. Next came the cameras, a concentration of media 
attention that elevated the case to a national affair. And now come the 
reformers, politicians who in response to the crime -- or is it the cameras? -- 
have buried the Capitol under a pile of anti-crime proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Three strikes, you're out. One strike, you're in. New prisons. Longer prison 
sentences. You name it, the get-tough legislation is in play. The bandwagon is 
so overloaded it has become an in-house joke here, the stuff of cynics. As one 
wag cracked at a reception after the governor's State of the State address: 
"Welcome to the Year of the Felon." 
</P>
<P>
 With the rush to reform upon us, it might be worthwhile to look back at one of 
the last times Sacramento got serious about overhauling the criminal justice 
system. It is a history that seems to reinforce a pet personal theory about 
reformers: Often, too often, what they promise is the exact opposite of what 
they produce. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Until the mid-1970s, criminals in California received what were called 
indeterminate sentences. Under this approach, to offer an admittedly 
oversimplified description, a convict could be released from prison only after 
serving a full sentence -- or when a parole board decided it was time. This 
gave power to judges and, more to the point, to parole board members. Put even 
more simply, it gave power to people, as opposed to calendars and uniform 
sentence codes. Someone could look a convict in the eye and say, "No. You are 
not ready." Someone could be held accountable. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly there were problems with this old method. There were conservatives 
who argued that the parole board had become, in fact, a sieve. It was too 
lenient. It made too many mistakes. Conversely, liberals complained that parole 
boards were biased; a black radical imprisoned for car theft, for instance, 
might face a far more difficult time winning parole than, say, a white 
murderer. And so a political alliance was forged, and it carried California 
into a new era of fixed, or determinate, sentences. Punishment would be, as the 
slogan of the hour went, "swift, certain and definite." 
</P>
<P>
 Some exceptions were made -- certain convicts still answered to the parole 
board -- but in general, from 1976 forward, California criminals entered prison 
knowing the day they'd be released. This new approach was not without bugs. 
Under the uniform sentences recalculated after much legislative negotiation, 
some serious criminals who had been routinely rejected by the parole board were 
set loose at once. Automatically. At the same time, prisons began overflowing. 
Why? The politician's favorite response to crime is to toughen sentences. 
Legislators look good when they can say they doubled the time for a certain 
crime. With fixed terms, however, there was no way to release the pressure on a 
prison population swollen by political zeal for tough anti-crime stances. There 
was no parole board to determine who might walk in order to create cell space 
for a more dangerous occupant. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, California's prison population has grown in less than two decades 
from roughly 20,000 to 120,000. No way could we build prisons fast enough to 
keep pace. The alternative was to cut mandatory terms -- without making it look 
like anyone up here had gone soft on crime. Thus it was decided that a convict 
who stayed out of trouble and worked in the prison laundry or such would be 
released after completing half a sentence. Again, this became a matter of 
routine. Automatic. "We kept letting them go, quietly, out the back door," said 
one veteran of the criminal justice machine, "so that we could squeeze more in 
through the front door." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What does this have to do with Polly Klaas? Well, when the reformers brought 
us determinate sentences in 1976, Richard Allen Davis, the girl's confessed 
killer, was serving a six-month to life term for kidnaping. Three times a 
parole board heard his case for early release. Three times it turned him down 
as a menace. 
</P>
<P>
 With the new system, however, Davis had his sentence recalculated. The uniform 
sentence for those convicted of his crime was now 72 months. And he was 
released. Automatically. Three years later, after he kidnaped another woman, 
Davis received another determinate sentence of 16 years. And in exactly eight 
years, in late June of last year, he again was released. Automatically. 
</P>
<P>
 You know the rest of this sad story, and probably have guessed at its moral: 
Beware of reformers. Even if their intentions are pure -- and even up here, 
sometimes they are -- the consequences of their fast work can be messy, 
unintended, plain wrong. There are no simple answers.

WARNINGS ON 757S SHOW FAA'S DILEMMA; AVIATION: SOME SEEK INCREASED LANDING 
DISTANCES IN LIGHT OF DANGEROUS WAKE TURBULENCE. AGENCY IS FORCED TO BALANCE 
SAFETY AND INDUSTRY'S ECONOMIC WELFARE IN ISSUING ALERTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BRAZIL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the FAA weighed recommendations more than two years ago to require more 
landing distance between Boeing 757 jetliners and planes following them, the 
agency found itself trying to serve two oft-competing masters: the welfare of 
the public it is charged to protect and the industry it was formed to promote. 
</P>
<P>
 At the root of recent revelations that the Federal Aviation Administration had 
repeated warnings that 757s produced dangerous wake turbulence lies a harsh 
economic reality: The agency knew any landing restriction it imposed would mean 
flight reductions and further revenue losses for an industry that has gone $10 
billion in the red since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Dec. 15 crash of a corporate jet in Santa Ana that flew into a 757's 
wake turbulence, killing all five people aboard, and a similar accident that 
killed eight people in December, 1992, some observers believe that the FAA may 
have chosen the industry's rail-thin profit margin over the public's safety 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA took no action on the 757 turbulence issue -- until recently -- 
despite compelling evidence from the National Aeronautics and Space 
Administration, the United Kingdom's Civil Aviation Authority and the National 
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can make a safety recommendation, but then the economic factors come into 
play," said Leo Garodz, a former FAA manager who was among the first to bring 
the 757 wake turbulence problem to the agency's attention. 
</P>
<P>
 An FAA specialist in wake turbulence for 20 years, Garodz said his 1991 
recommendations on the 757 were not made lightly, but he is sympathetic to the 
FAA's plight. "You're between the devil and the deep blue sea. On the one hand, 
you've got safety. On the other, you've got the industry." 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for the dilemma, critics say, is easy enough to illustrate: 
</P>
<P>
 On average, 74 Boeing 757s land daily at Los Angeles International Airport, 
mostly during peak travel hours. Other jets must remain at least three miles 
behind. If the FAA landing distance requirement was increased by two miles and 
made mandatory -- as some suggested after the accidents -- it would effectively 
push back all the planes bound for the airport. To the airlines, it could mean 
about 30 fewer jets could land during the peak travel day. 
</P>
<P>
 At an average of 200 passengers per plane, the lost revenue is significant. 
</P>
<P>
 Multiply that by the number of airports in the country and the millions of 
dollars in lost opportunity add up. 
</P>
<P>
 FAA spokesman Fred O'Donnell in Los Angeles acknowledged that the agency has 
twin missions: to keep the skies safe and "to foster the growth of civil 
aviation." But he said it was an oversimplification to characterize the 757 
decision-making process as a matter of safety versus money. He said the 
evidence given to the FAA over the last two years, although compelling to many, 
was inconclusive to the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
 Since fall, 1991, at least two reports on the potential dangers of 757 wake 
turbulence have been presented to the FAA, in addition to anecdotal evidence 
gathered from pilots by NASA's Aviation Safety Reporting System. One report, a 
study by Garodz and National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration researcher 
Kirk Clawson, concluded that the medium-size 757 appeared to generate the most 
powerful wake turbulence they had ever measured -- more powerful than aircraft 
nearly four times its size. The researchers recommended that the FAA 
immediately require smaller planes to stay four miles behind 757s on final 
approach under all circumstances and that further testing be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Wake turbulence occurs when a jet speeds through the air, leaving an 
invisible, but potentially lethal trail of horizontal cyclones that spring out 
from each wingtip. Such turbulence can cause even mid-size jets to pitch 
violently and can toss around smaller aircraft like toys. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent accident believed to have been linked to 757 wake turbulence 
claimed the lives of two executives of the In-N-Out burger chain when a 
twin-engine jet landing about two miles behind a 757 at John Wayne Airport went 
out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 Garodz said the landing distance recommendations "went over like a lead 
balloon" because "there always is pressure from the industry to close down 
separation distances." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Garodz said, when the FAA embarked on the study, which also called 
for testing the larger Boeing 767, it harbored hopes that the results would 
allow it to decrease the separation requirements for those two aircraft. So did 
United Airlines, which offered aircraft to use in the study. 
</P>
<P>
 "United Airlines believes the potential benefit of this scientific test -- 
proving that airport capacity can be increased 5% to 10% by safely reducing the 
separation between planes -- justifies its contribution of aircraft and crew 
members for this study," James M. Guyette, a United executive vice president, 
said at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Garodz and Clawson also advised the FAA that the space requirement for the 767 
-- six miles for smaller aircraft -- not be reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 That, too, was greeted with "less than enthusiasm," Garodz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody likes delays," he said. "They want to bring the planes closer and 
increase traffic flow." To this day, the FAA says it regularly receives 
proposals from airline carriers, manufacturers and airports to increase the 
number of passengers they handle by decreasing space requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the FAA, an average delay of 10 minutes per flight at an airport 
the size of Seattle-Tacoma International results in a combined $93 million in 
losses for the airline carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, according to an FAA report, 23 of the nation's largest airports each 
suffered more than $32 million in losses, solely because of delays, many of 
which occurred because the approach routes to those destinations were packed 
with planes. The problem is limited navigable airspace. Every airline wants to 
be in it during convenient flying hours, from dawn to dusk. 
</P>
<P>
 Any lengthening of distance requirements between aircraft makes for fewer 
flights and fewer opportunities for takeoffs and landings during optimal flying 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll never say it, but the FAA is in the business of keeping aircraft 
moving," said pilot Peter Murray, who has flown commercial jets for 28 years 
and regularly skippers 757s. "It basically comes down to dollars and cents." 
</P>
<P>
 All of which makes hard-hit airline carriers more interested in reducing 
airplane separation standards, which would allow them to land more planes more 
frequently and would improve their bottom lines. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, said John O'Brien of the Air Line Pilots Assn., which often finds 
itself fighting for increased space between aircraft for safety reasons, "we 
see much more interest in doing these things when people are looking for a way 
to better themselves economically." 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA acknowledges that there is a direct correlation between the lack of 
navigable airspace and aircraft separation requirements, and it is an area of 
concern to the FAA and the entire industry, spokesman O'Donnell said. Listed 
among the goals of the FAA's 1991 annual report on the airport capacity 
problem: "More efficient spacing along the final approach path." 
</P>
<P>
 "The FAA's position is that there is insufficient capacity in this country to 
meet the projected needs," O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the FAA recently has taken actions that suggest the 757 could be 
reclassified as a heavy jet, which could require up to two miles of increased 
spacing -- from four miles to six -- for smaller trailing aircraft, the agency 
strongly asserted that it did not sacrifice safety by ignoring the data it had 
received. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it was with no information other than the two recent crashes that 
prompted FAA Administrator David Hinson to issue a bulletin Dec. 22, 
instructing the nation's air traffic controllers to tell pilots landing behind 
757s they should be aware of potentially heavy turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donnell said the agency would never compromise the traveling public or the 
"public that lives under the flight path." But, he said, "we do recognize that 
certain orders will have a definite economic impact. . . . We have to ask: 
'Will this create an economic hardship that will destroy the industry?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Although the FAA looks out for airline manufacturers and carriers, O'Donnell 
said, the agency does not shirk from taking a tough stand. He referred to the 
Noise and Capacity Act of 1991, which requires the industry by 2000 to phase 
out older models such as 727s, 747s and DC-9s in favor of quieter, more 
fuel-efficient, twin-engine aircraft such as the 757, 767 and the new 777. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Donnell said: "The airline industry did not like it. They maintained that it 
would force many of them out of business. Nevertheless, we felt there was a 
need to do that, and we did it." 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, Boeing spokeswoman Elizabeth Reese said, the company would need 
to examine closely any proposal to increase separation distances for the 757. 
In addition to the concern about increased delays, Reese said, there is another 
complication: Many environmentally sensitive airports, such as John Wayne in 
Orange County, bar aircraft classified as heavy. Reclassifying the 757 as a 
heavy would probably make the aircraft builder's third-most popular jet less 
marketable, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Slots are few and airports are real crowded," Reese said. "You try to get the 
airplanes in and out as fast as you can." 
</P>
<P>
 At a minimum, aviation sources say, even if the FAA did not want to adopt 
stricter spacing requirements when it first learned of the 757's wake 
turbulence problem, it was obliged to alert pilots so they could take extra 
precautions. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, the commercial jet pilot, said air traffic controllers are very busy 
and frequently encourage pilots to fly under visual flight rules, which takes 
much of the responsibility for maintaining a safe distance between aircraft off 
the controller's shoulders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obvious with this wake vortex problem you can't just tell a small-plane 
pilot: 'There's a Boeing 757 in front of you, good luck. You're on your own.' 
</P>
<P>
 "He has no way of knowing how far he is from the jet in front of him," said 
Murray, whose son flies commuter planes. "He's hoping he's far enough away, but 
the controllers know." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien of the Air Line Pilots Assn., which represents 40,000 pilots from 38 
airlines, said the association for years has asked that the type of wake 
turbulence testing done on the 757 be made a routine part of the airline 
certification process. But "there wasn't great enthusiasm for that," he said. 
It appears a stronger case could be made for that now, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 William Reynard, head of NASA's Aviation Safety Reporting System, which twice 
alerted the FAA last year to the 757 problem, said the FAA does the best it can 
in weighing safety and economic issues. But, he said, "I think it's intelligent 
at this point" that the FAA has begun further testing on the 757 and is 
considering creating a special category for spacing purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Carey, a close friend of John O. McDaniel, the pilot of the plane that 
crashed in Santa Ana last month after encountering 757 wake turbulence, said 
safety factors should far outweigh monetary ones. "I'm not an aviator, but 
safety comes first and nothing else should be considered," Carey said. 
"Granted, you want your company to make some profits, but I don't see throwing 
in a risk factor for monetary reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look what could have been avoided in this case," he said.

U.S., ABU DHABI OK $400-MILLION BCCI SETTLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U.S. prosecutors and banking officials settled a legal and diplomatic battle 
with Abu Dhabi on Saturday when the royal family of the Persian Gulf state 
agreed to give up claims to $400 million that it had invested in First American 
Bankshares Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement also gives investigators access to a key witness with knowledge 
of the BCCI financial scandal, sources familiar with the agreement said. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, a $1.5-billion civil lawsuit against Abu Dhabi's ruler, brought by 
First American's court-appointed trustee, will be dropped, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. prosecutors also have agreed not to pursue any criminal charges against 
the ruler, Sheik Zayed ibn Sultan al Nuhayan, who was the majority shareholder 
in the now-defunct Bank of Credit & Commerce International. 
</P>
<P>
 With the dropping of Abu Dhabi's claims on the $400 million, about half will 
go to the U.S. Treasury and the other half to depositors of BCCI around the 
world who lost money when the scandal-ridden bank was shut down in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal provides for U.S. investigators to speak for the first time with 
Swaleh Naqvi, the chief deputy to BCCI founder Aga Hasan Abedi. He is under 
indictment in the United States on bank fraud charges, but has never been 
interviewed by prosecutors because he and other key BCCI officials are under 
house arrest in Abu Dhabi. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement, signed by the parties Saturday after meetings in Geneva, also 
will give U.S. officials access to BCCI documents that were flown out of London 
to Abu Dhabi by Naqvi just before the bank was closed by regulators for 
widespread fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a remarkable agreement in terms of what we've succeeded in getting," 
said Deputy Atty. Gen. Philip B. Heymann. He praised "the breadth of questions 
resolved, the money to the U.S. and the level of cooperation among the Justice 
Department, the New York district attorney's office and other agencies, both 
public and private." 
</P>
<P>
 New York Dist. Atty. Robert M. Morgenthau and Justice Department officials 
have fought for more than three years for the chance to interview Naqvi and 
other witnesses in Abu Dhabi. 
</P>
<P>
 Abedi had a stroke several years ago and is unable to be interviewed. But 
Naqvi may be able to tell investigators how BCCI came to illegally own four 
U.S. banks, including First American, and who knew about it in this country.

BLACK LEADERS' TALKS FOCUS ON YOUTH; VIOLENCE: JACKSON CALLS FOR A 'MORAL 
OFFENSIVE,' USING THE FAMILY, CHURCH AND SCHOOL. HE WILL TAKE AGENDA TO 
CLINTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Black leaders at a summit meeting on violence produced an agenda Saturday that 
was heavy on the old-fashioned notion of reaching out to save wayward young 
people through family, church and school. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Jesse Jackson, whose National Rainbow Coalition convened the 
three-day summit, called for black Americans to take the "moral offensive" in 
the attack on violence. 
</P>
<P>
 He also pushed some of his own political causes, such as voter registration 
and pressing the Clinton Administration to put together an urban policy and to 
take a stronger position on civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oftentimes, what a movement does is determine the options of a President," 
Jackson said. "Urban policy, for the first time in a long time, will be 
discussed at the White House. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said he would take the agenda to President Clinton. No meeting date 
had been set as of Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that on April 4, the 26th anniversary of the assassination of 
Martin Luther King Jr., youth from around the country will march on the White 
House to challenge the Clinton Administration to devise what they consider a 
coherent urban policy and a meaningful jobs bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson called the summit to address what black leaders have called an 
alarming rise in murder, assault and other violent crime among black Americans. 
Homicide is the leading cause of death among black males, and the killer 
typically is another young black male. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants came away calling the agenda a watershed and said it would be 
received enthusiastically in urban communities struggling with violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first meaningful and measurable blow to deal with the problem. 
While black people are not a monolith, on this issue we are pretty close to a 
consensus," said Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.), chairman of the Congressional Black 
Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
 Mfume suggested attacking the problem with an all-out traditional values 
campaign that stresses responsibility, respect for the elderly, pride in black 
heritage and stronger connections between black parents and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 New York civil rights activist Al Sharpton suggested that blacks press for 
criminal penalties for gun manufacturers whose weapons turn up in markets for 
illegal sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's agenda also forged an alliance between high-profile leaders and 
some grass-roots activists. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are some of the walls we must knock down," said Minister Fontian, a 
Chicago activist who works with the Black Disciples, a gang with about 35,000 
members. "They need us as much as we need them. Now I can go back and give a 
reasonable report." 
</P>
<P>
 Proposals on the overall agenda included: 
</P>
<P>
 * Mentoring 10 youths each at 100 churches in 100 cities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Anti-violence pledges between students and parents. 
</P>
<P>
 * Crackdowns by parents on studying and attending school. 
</P>
<P>
 * Employment programs for young people aged 17 to 30. 
</P>
<P>
 * Degree programs at black colleges for prison inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 * Supervised after-school programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Removing barriers to family life in social service programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Housing Secretary Henry G. Cisneros pointed to rules in public housing that 
tie rent to a family's income. In many cases, he said, husbands and fathers 
leave the household so their income won't be included and the rent won't go up. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros said he wants to delete such rules from housing policy. Those 
barriers aside, he said, families can then help themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Government is not very good at strengthening families," he said. "Government 
can do something. We can do a better job."

STORM, ICE KNOCK OUT POWER IN THE EAST; WEATHER: NEARLY 400,000 LOSE 
ELECTRICITY FROM WEST VIRGINIA TO NEW ENGLAND. BOSTON AREA GETS 16 INCHES OF 
SNOW.

<P>
 Nearly 400,000 people were left without power Saturday as another wave of 
snow, ice and freezing rain battered the Northeast and mid-Atlantic states. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures dipped well below freezing overnight before warming up just 
enough to leave much of the region coated in a patina of half-frozen ice that 
made driving, and even walking, dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 As the region's third storm in two weeks moved out to sea, ice weighed down 
and snapped many power lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Utility repair crews were busy from West Virginia into New England. "Our crews 
have been out all night," said Donna Nowcid, spokeswoman for Jersey Central 
Power & Light in New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 The heavy layers of ice knocked out power to about 200,000 people in the 
Philadelphia area, 74,000 customers in New Jersey, 10,000 customers in Rhode 
Island, 87,000 customers on New York's Long Island and more than 25,800 
customers in West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Weather Service predicted more blowing and drifting snow late 
Saturday in southern New England, while another six inches of snow was expected 
to fall atop half a foot of snow already on the ground in Maine, New Hampshire 
and Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow levels reached 15 inches at Hartford, Conn., eight inches at Providence, 
R.I., and a little less over Cape Cod, where snow had earlier turned to rain as 
the winter storm system moved off to the northeast. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boston area was buried under almost 16 inches of snow, and Logan 
International Airport was shut down for more than seven hours Saturday when the 
sole operating runway was declared unsafe. The airport reopened in the late 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews at New Jersey's Newark International Airport kept only one of two main 
runways open at a time in order to clear the other, said operations agent Tom 
Suarez. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather also affected train travel. 
</P>
<P>
 Signal and switch problems south of Philadelphia caused one- to two-hour 
delays on four of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor trains between Washington and 
Boston, said spokesman Cliff Black. 
</P>
<P>
 Metro North Commuter Railroad, which connects New York City to its northern 
suburbs, experienced delays of as much as an hour because of switches that 
froze overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities asked motorists to stay off the roads, and officials in several 
states banned propane shipments and extra-long trucks from the region's biggest 
highway. 
</P>
<P>
 A Massachusetts State Police spokesman said that the interstate highways were 
largely deserted. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of New York City awoke Saturday to a coating of ice on trees, 
buildings and walkways, as freezing rain teamed up with earlier snow to make 
travel treacherous. Few people braved the city streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the region's ski resort operators have found much to cheer about. Ski 
areas in New England reported the best conditions in five years, with a foot or 
more of fresh powder falling on bases of 24-50 inches, allowing most resorts to 
open nearly all of their trails.

THOUSANDS JOIN CLINTON IN MOURNING HIS MOTHER; FUNERAL: NEIGHBORS, OFFICIALS 
AND HOLLYWOOD FIGURES HEAR VIRGINIA KELLEY EULOGIZED AS 'ON THE WAY TO HEAVEN.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Several thousand mourners, including neighbors, government officials and 
Hollywood figures, joined President Clinton on Saturday at the funeral of his 
mother, Virginia Kelley, who was eulogized as "a celebration on the way to 
heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 The flamboyant Kelley, who died Thursday from complications of breast cancer, 
was so popular that the service was conducted at the 3,000-seat civic 
auditorium in Clinton's boyhood home, rather than at a church. 
</P>
<P>
 All of Hot Springs' residents were invited to attend and nearly every seat was 
filled. Hundreds waited outside the hall in 18-degree weather for an hour 
before the doors opened at 7:30 a.m. local time. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Methodist ministers conducted the service, including the Rev. John 
Miles, a family friend and the pastor of St. James Methodist Church in Little 
Rock, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
 To show their respect for Kelley, city officials flew the flags at municipal 
buildings at half-staff, and signs of affection were posted in many shop 
windows. "God Bless You, Virginia," read the marquee of a local music club. 
</P>
<P>
 The mourners included Vice President Al Gore, Commerce Secretary Ronald H. 
Brown and longtime government friends, including Sen. David Pryor (D-Ark.) and 
Gov. Jim Guy Tucker. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood was represented by singer Barbra Streisand and TV producer Harry 
Thomason, strong supporters of the President. Only last week, Kelley had 
attended Streisand's concert in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 The President and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton, both wearing black, sat 
somberly in the first row for the Methodist service as the strains of the hymn 
"Amazing Grace" filled the auditorium. Their daughter, Chelsea, and Kelley's 
husband, Richard, were alongside them. Clinton did not speak at the service. 
</P>
<P>
 After the morning service, Clinton led a funeral procession on the 90-mile 
drive to his birthplace in Hope, Ark., for a private burial service. Kelley was 
laid to rest among the graves of other family members, including Clinton's 
father, William Jefferson Blythe, who was killed in a car crash shortly before 
the President was born. Two later husbands also died. 
</P>
<P>
 The funeral service, billed as "a celebration of life and resurrection," was 
joyful and upbeat for the retired nurse who loved parties and horse-racing and 
fought a four-year battle against breast cancer before succumbing at age 70. 
</P>
<P>
 Miles eulogized Kelley as "an American original," saying the woman who loved 
to gamble probably would have preferred that the services be held at the race 
track. 
</P>
<P>
 "She went to church and then she went to the races right after," he told the 
congregation. "She was filled with the very essence of life. She was a 
celebration on the way to heaven." 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to the President and to his younger half brother, Roger, Miles said 
of Kelley: "She loved her sons unconditionally, and she needed to at times. 
Both of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Clinton, a singer and musician, is a recovered drug addict. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the day, Clinton held back tears as he said goodby to his 
stepfather and half brother, who held a single yellow rose and wept openly. 
</P>
<P>
 The President gave his stepfather a bear hug before departing for Washington 
aboard a presidential aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's emotional return to Arkansas marked the third time in a year he has 
returned to his home state for a funeral of someone close to him. Hillary 
Clinton's father, Hugh Rodham, died of a stroke last April, and Vincent Foster, 
White House deputy counsel and a longtime family friend, committed suicide last 
July.

RUSSIAN HEADS FOR A RECORD 14-MONTH SPACE MISSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Veteran Russian cosmonaut Valery Polyakov blasted into orbit Saturday at the 
start of a record-breaking space mission due to last a year and two months. 
</P>
<P>
 A Soyuz TM-18 spacecraft carrying Polyakov and two crew mates, Viktor 
Afanasyev and Yuri Usachov, took off from Baikonur cosmodrome in Kazakhstan and 
went into orbit successfully nine minutes later. 
</P>
<P>
 Polyakov, a 51-year-old doctor, will spend 429 days aboard Russia's Mir space 
station carrying out medical experiments to test the effects of long periods of 
weightlessness on the human body. 
</P>
<P>
 Polyakov's flight is intended to beat the previous record of 366 days in 
space, set by cosmonauts Vladimir Titov and Musa Manarov between December, 
1988, and December, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Before stepping aboard the Soyuz rocket, Polyakov expressed the wish that life 
for Russians would improve in the 14-month interval before he returns. "See you 
again in a better life," he said.

MEXICO CITY BLAST SPARKS FEARS VIOLENCE WILL SPREAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As army troops continued to bar access to indigenous communities in the south 
where the government has attacked suspected rebel strongholds, a car bomb 
exploded early Saturday in the capital amid fears that violence may spread. 
</P>
<P>
 A second explosion was reported in the tourist resort of Acapulco as 
government agencies stepped up security measures following threats from the 
self-proclaimed Zapatista National Liberation Army to extend its war to the 
capital. 
</P>
<P>
 No one claimed responsibility for Saturday's explosions, but suspicion 
immediately fell on the Indian rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexico City newspaper La Jornada said it received a fax from the rebels 
saying they are willing to talk with the government, the Associated Press 
reported. The fax said the offer wasn't a surrender and appealed to Mexicans to 
join the rebels' cause. 
</P>
<P>
 In the southern, impoverished state of Chiapas, where the uprising began a 
week ago, about 100 demonstrators marched through winter drizzle Saturday 
through the picturesque town of San Cristobal de las Casas demanding an end to 
all violence. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Mexico City, where at least 6,000 demonstrators marched Friday, an 
estimated 3,000 protesters rallied outside the Interior Ministry to demand the 
firing of Interior Minister Patrocinio Gonzalez Blanco, who until recently was 
the governor of Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters blame Gonzalez for past brutal campaigns against Chiapas' large 
Indian population. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexico City blast, which injured five people and damaged about 20 
businesses, occurred about 1 a.m. Saturday in the underground parking garage of 
a shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 Around dawn, a grenade exploded outside government offices in the tourist city 
of Acapulco. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zapatista Army claims to have an urban front, which earlier in the week 
vowed to attack "nerve centers of the oligarchy." Authorities said they were 
beefing up police patrols and other security at airports and other government 
installations. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are afraid that (violence) could extend to other parts of the republic 
and that this could turn out to be a more organized group," said author Homero 
Aridjis, president of the Group of 100, an environmental organization. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report late Friday, the Interior Ministry conceded that the guerrillas 
are not a largely foreign-inspired movement and that the leaders are mainly 
home-grown.

BOSNIA ISSUE A THORN AT NATO SUMMIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When President Clinton and other leaders of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization gather here today, one issue most of them won't want to talk about 
is Bosnia-Herzegovina and the brutal war that NATO has so conspicuously failed 
to end. 
</P>
<P>
 But they won't have that luxury. Bosnia is forcing its way onto the agenda of 
the NATO summit, whether the alliance's leaders like it or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who arrived in Brussels on Saturday to 
prepare the way for Clinton, asked European foreign ministers to head off 
another angry debate over who is to blame for NATO's inability to end the siege 
of Sarajevo, diplomats said. 
</P>
<P>
 But French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said his government will press for an 
explicit NATO commitment to use military force in Sarajevo -- and an explicit 
U.S. commitment to provide ground troops to implement a European peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Events on the ground have made the French demands more urgent. Serbian 
shelling of Sarajevo closed the city's airport -- and thus its major pipeline 
of humanitarian relief -- for most of last week. The French commander of U.N. 
troops in the former Yugoslav republics, Gen. Jean Cot, asked for authority to 
order air strikes in retaliation, but U.N. Secretary General Boutros 
Boutros-Ghali turned him down. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher, who steadfastly opposes sending U.S. ground troops into Bosnia, 
has been battling against reopening the issue at the summit. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, recognizing that NATO can't duck the presence of a brutal war on 
its own border, Christopher has been working toward agreement on a NATO 
statement that would reaffirm past commitments to act to prevent the fall of 
Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Those past commitments appear to have had little practical effect. The Serbian 
forces besieging Sarajevo have subjected the Bosnian capital to daily 
bombardment and cut off its electricity and water, and NATO has not retaliated. 
U.S. officials argue, though, that NATO's threats may have restrained the Serbs 
from pressing their offensive even further. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats said there was little support in the alliance for France's demand 
for immediate military action. Britain, Spain and Canada all worry that air 
strikes against Serbian positions would lead to retaliation against their 
peacekeeping troops in Bosnia -- and eventually force their withdrawal 
entirely, leaving the Bosnians even worse off.

RUSSIANS DON'T EXPECT MUCH FROM CLINTON TRIP; SUMMIT: PRESIDENT HAS LITTLE TO 
OFFER BESIDES MORAL SUPPORT. HIS PRIORITY WILL BE TRYING TO SHORE UP ECONOMIC 
REFORMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After lashing back at Western-guided reformers in their parliamentary 
elections, Russians will take a skeptical first look at President Clinton this 
week as he visits the former Communist empire that the West had pledged so 
grandly to remake. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardened by two years of promise and frustration, Russians don't expect much. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does Clinton have much to offer beyond a new slogan of moral support 
during three days of talks with President Boris N. Yeltsin. Mindful of budget 
restraints at home, growing resentment here of foreign advice and Moscow's 
delays in using money already set aside, the White House has announced that 
there will be no new aid package this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Planned as a celebration of the free-market reformers' expected triumph in a 
democratic new Parliament, the summit has become a pause for sober reflection 
by both leaders over how to preserve Russia's still fragile transformation -- 
Clinton's top foreign policy priority -- in the wake of stunning election gains 
last month by neo-fascists and Communists. 
</P>
<P>
 "This visit manifests a new period -- a partnership without illusions," said 
Vladimir P. Lukin, Russia's ambassador to the United States. "We should stop 
behaving as a couple that vacillates between passionate kisses of love and 
equally passionate irritations over presumed betrayal." 
</P>
<P>
 Lukin, who was elected to the Parliament as a moderate reformer and will soon 
leave his diplomatic post, said in an interview that the new period should be 
characterized by a search for Russia's "own unique approach to economic reform" 
and a greater independence from the West. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a proud sentiment voiced these days by many Russians who accepted 
Western-prescribed market reforms launched in early 1992. Billions of dollars 
in promised Western aid barely materialized, and they instead received the pain 
of high inflation, creeping unemployment and troubling rates of homelessness 
and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The souring of Moscow's expectations -- after thunderous applause for Yeltsin 
in the U.S. Congress in June, 1992, and three upbeat summits with Presidents 
George Bush and Clinton -- was dramatized on Dec. 12 when hard-line opposition 
parties that view the United States as an enemy won 45% of the vote here. 
</P>
<P>
 Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, the neo-fascist whose movement rode the backlash to a 
first-place finish, said Thursday that Clinton ought to stay home and "play his 
saxophone." 
</P>
<P>
 "All of you in the West have become rotten and moldy," he said. "You want us 
to be weak and to rot together with you. . . . Rot without us." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, however, Zhirinovsky took on a conciliatory tone. In an interview 
with CNN, he insisted he seeks to cooperate with world leaders and even said he 
has a "good opinion" of Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Russians interviewed at random in Moscow last week seemed to regard Clinton 
with the same skepticism they hold for their own politicians. While it is fine 
for him to come shake Yeltsin's hand and learn about their country, many of 
them said, it would not reverse the post-Communist decline in their living 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe in the future something will result from this visit, but as of now I 
see no reason why I should feel exultation," said Lidia A. Larina, 37, a 
teacher who lost her job last year in a budget cutback. "As for reforms, maybe 
Russia has gained from them, but I can't see what. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyway," she added, "the United States and its President cannot be blamed for 
the poverty in Russia. It is we who must solve our internal problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Radical free-marketeers, who got 16% of the Parliament vote, say the 
do-it-yourself mood is a healthy sign that Russians are learning to take 
personal responsibility after seven decades of communism and two years of 
excessive faith in Western aid. 
</P>
<P>
 But the radicals' immediate problem is how to save their policies and jobs. 
Since mid-1992, they have been thwarted by a conservative faction of the 
government that opposes rigorous anti-inflation conditions set by the 
International Monetary Fund on the bulk of Western credits and that has 
repeatedly violated them. 
</P>
<P>
 The radicals under Economics Minister Yegor T. Gaidar, who designed the 
reforms, say the biggest threat to Russia is inflation -- about 900% last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation, they say, has been caused by the government exceeding IMF targets 
on state spending to bail out money-losing industries. They say the sooner 
those industries are forced to close, the sooner the economy can be 
restructured and stop shrinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservatives, led by Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin, see a greater 
threat in mass unemployment. To avoid politically risky factory shutdowns, they 
argue that the West should aid a more gradual transition to the free market -- 
high inflation and all. 
</P>
<P>
 Largely because the Cabinet is too divided to pursue a consistent strategy, 
promised aid has stalled. The IMF, for example, is holding up a $1.5-billion 
credit agreed to last summer and a standby loan of several billion dollars 
because the government has failed to close a huge budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 And Russia has yet to use a $70-million loan approved last year by the World 
Bank to set up an unemployment benefits program -- the first step of a planned 
Western-aided "social safety net" to ease the pain of reform. This is because 
the Russian Finance Ministry has clamped down on borrowing that doesn't 
generate a cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
 After voters rebelled last month, Yeltsin was urged to choose between the 
government's rival factions, but there is no sign he has done so. Both Gaidar 
and Chernomyrdin are expected to keep their jobs in a long-delayed Cabinet 
reshuffle -- an apparent recipe for more deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid conflicting signals from his Administration, Clinton appeared to come 
down on the side of the radical reformers Wednesday when he endorsed "more 
attempts to build a safety net to deal with consequences of reform (in Russia) 
but not an attempt to slow down the reform effort." 
</P>
<P>
 But unless it is attached to new funds for social spending, Russians may 
ignore such advice. Clinton himself characterized his "more reform, more 
therapy" prescription as a "bumper sticker" about the way his Administration 
feels about Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 To hear Clinton repeat that slogan loud and clear in Russia is the best the 
radicals can hope for after an election that left them badly wounded. "It's 
more important what he says than what he provides in actual money," said Anders 
Aslund, a Swedish economist on Gaidar's advisory team. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Clinton listens to moderate reformers and centrists in the new 
Parliament -- as he must do to overcome criticism for supporting Yeltsin's 
violent closure of the old one -- he will hear a wide range of ideas on how to 
remake Russia, some of which have not been tested. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is also likely to hear such assertiveness from Yeltsin himself, as the 
Russian leader stakes out an increasingly independent foreign policy. Yeltsin 
is expected to argue against an eastward expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 But Russians may not be paying attention. Former President Ronald Reagan's 
swashbuckling 1988 visit here during the heyday of perestroika and the 
big-money promises of former President George Bush will be a hard act for 
Clinton to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Russian people will soon start thinking about these summits the way they 
think about space flights," said Mikhail Berger, a columnist for the newspaper 
Izvestia. "It is important, it is undoubtedly an achievement, but it is 
somewhere way up there, very remote. You can watch it on TV, but it has no 
consequence in real life."

REGULAR INSPECTIONS DEMANDED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two powerful U.S. senators said Saturday that Washington will not accept a 
onetime inspection of North Korea's declared nuclear facilities and will 
instead demand access to suspect sites and even waste and disposal areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Democrat Sam Nunn and Indiana Republican Richard G. Lugar, both 
experts on the North Korean situation, cautioned against overoptimism in the 
tense dispute over nuclear inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Undersecretary of State Lynn Davis had raised hopes that the inspection 
dispute was near a settlement when he said in Washington on Wednesday that 
North Korea had agreed in negotiations with the United States to allow 
inspections of seven declared nuclear sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said that the United States would seek to obtain access to undeclared 
nuclear sites for experts of the United Nations' nuclear watchdog, the 
International Atomic Energy Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty clearly calls for inspections by the 
IAEA not only on a onetime basis but on a regular basis and on a spot basis, on 
any basis that is required to make certain that non-proliferation is obtained," 
Lugar told a news conference at the U.S. Embassy in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is, I think, a necessity not to be satisfied with some kind of 
compromise, modest agreement here," Nunn said.

3 IN FAMILY SURVIVE PLANE CRASH; 5 DIE

<P>
 A family of three walked away with only minor injuries from a fiery plane 
crash that killed the other five people on board, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The British Aerospace Jetstream 41, which can carry 29 passengers, crashed 
Friday night about half a mile from Port Columbus International Airport, where 
it was preparing to land after a flight from Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Aviation Administration investigators said they had recovered the 
flight recorder from the wreckage of United Express Flight 6291 but made no 
other comment. 
</P>
<P>
 All three crew members and two passengers were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The survivors were 5-year-old Yee Sun Lai; her father, Ki Ping Lai, 45; and 
her mother, Siew Chew Ling, 43, all from Taiwan, said Mark Hopkins, spokesman 
at Mt. Carmel East Hospital in Columbus. All were treated for minor injuries 
and released. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane hit the ground in a wooded area, cartwheeled about 300 feet into a 
single-story, cinder block building and caught fire, a highway patrol trooper 
said.

PAKISTANI OFFICIAL WARNS OF NUCLEAR WAR OVER KASHMIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IAN McWILLIAM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pakistan's foreign minister warned Saturday of the danger of nuclear war in 
South Asia if India and Pakistan fail to resolve their longstanding dispute 
over Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
 The dire but ambiguous remark by Sardar Assef Ahmed Ali, on a weeklong tour of 
former Soviet republics in Central Asia, came just days after a stalemate in 
negotiations over Kashmir in the Pakistani capital of Islamabad. 
</P>
<P>
 Ali's strong statement appears to be largely an attempt to regionalize the 
Kashmir issue by pulling Uzbekistan and the other Muslim republics of Central 
Asia into a negotiating process that India insists should be strictly 
bilateral. 
</P>
<P>
 But talk of war is likely to create more disquiet in the region rocked by 
fighting in Afghanistan, Tajikistan and other hot spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Ali told reporters here that "the core problem of South Asia is the Kashmir 
dispute." Unless this dispute "is solved on the basis of international law and 
the U.N. resolutions," he said, "there cannot be lasting peace in South Asia." 
</P>
<P>
 Pakistan and India have gone to war three times since their independence in 
1947. Kashmir, predominantly Muslim but mostly under the control of 
predominantly Hindu India, was the prime cause of two of those wars. 
</P>
<P>
 The threat of another Indo-Pakistani war is heightened by the fact that both 
countries are believed either to possess nuclear weapons or to have the 
components to assemble them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The concern of the world, the concern of South Asia countries," Ali said, "is 
that if a war takes place in South Asia, it might become a nuclear war. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all want to see that this does not happen," he said, "and the best way to 
do that is to resolve the Kashmir dispute."

MORTY THE MOOSE OF TV'S 'NORTHERN EXPOSURE' DIES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Morty, the moose that ambles through the opening credits of the TV show 
"Northern Exposure," has died of an illness linked to a mineral deficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 The moose, brought from Alaska as an orphan yearling five years ago, was a 
subject of studies headed by Charles Robbins, a Washington State University 
professor of natural resource sciences. Researchers later found a cobalt and 
copper deficiency in the diet of the moose that led to its death, Robbins said.

2 CHARGED IN DEATH OF MAN IN COLLISION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles police arrested two young men on suspicion of murder late Friday 
after a sports car they had allegedly stolen smashed into a van, killing a 
passenger. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Menchaca and Juan Hernandez, both 18, were being held in the death of 
a 26-year-old Orange County man, whose name was withheld pending notification 
of next of kin, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 7:30 p.m. Friday, two men approached Brian Kim as he parked his 
Mitsubishi 3000 GT on Marathon Street and took it at gunpoint, Lt. John 
Fletcher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim called police, and officers spotted the car nearly three hours later and 
began tailing it. 
</P>
<P>
 As the car traveled east on Carroll Street, it slammed into a Dodge van on 
Douglas Street. 
</P>
<P>
 One passenger was thrown from the vehicle and struck his head on a retaining 
wall. He was pronounced dead at the scene, Fletcher said. Two other passengers 
were hospitalized at USC Medical Center, listed in critical but stable 
condition.

GREGORY OSBORNE; DANCER STARRED IN BALLETS WORLDWIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gregory Osborne, guest artist with many of the world's most prestigious ballet 
companies whose classic good looks helped make him a favorite in the 
traditional dance repertoire, died Saturday in Newport Beach, where he was 
raised. 
</P>
<P>
 The strikingly handsome performer, who looked more like a prototypal surfer 
than a ballet dancer, was 39 and died of cancer, a family spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne, who turned to dancing as therapy after he broke both legs in a 
childhood sledding accident, became intrigued with dance as a possible 
profession while in his early teens. 
</P>
<P>
 He studied at the North Carolina School of the Arts, starred as Patrick in a 
Corona del Mar High School production of "Auntie Mame" and was encouraged by 
Ferdinand Nault, director of Les Grands Ballets Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined the American Ballet Theater in the 1970s and won a bronze medal at 
the First International Ballet Competition in Jackson, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
 His renown spread, and in 1983 he left the American Ballet Theater for what he 
felt were more promising roles as a principal classics dancer with the National 
Ballet of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 He became best known for his performances in "Les Sylphides," "Swan Lake," 
"Sleeping Beauty," "La Bayadere" and "Giselle." 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne also was seen regularly with the English National Ballet, the San 
Francisco Ballet and the Royal Danish Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990 he left the National Ballet of Canada to pursue a free-lance career. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include his mother, Lois; father, Matthew and a brother.

OSCAR FRALEY; WROTE 'THE UNTOUCHABLES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oscar Fraley, the onetime sports reporter whose high-spirited chronicling of 
"The Untouchables" spawned a hugely successful TV series and two feature films, 
has died. He was 79. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraley died after stomach surgery Thursday night in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla., his 
wife, Imogene, said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraley, who wrote his book based on lengthy conversations with Eliot Ness, the 
federal gangbuster whose team sent Al Capone to prison, had been writing sports 
for United Press International when he met Ness in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 Over what Fraley recalled as being several glasses of Scotch at the 
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, Ness began recounting his pursuit of Capone and other 
Prohibition-era mobsters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said: 'Why don't you write a book?' He said: 'You're a writer. You write 
it,' " Fraley said in an interview later. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraley completed the book about the colorful Treasury Department agent and his 
colleagues in 1957. He titled it "The Untouchables," a sobriquet placed on the 
gangbusters by a Chicago newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraley said in interviews over the years that in October, 1957, he took the 
proofs to Ness' home in Coudersport, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 "He read them all. Then he went out to the kitchen to get a drink of water and 
fell over dead," Fraley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ness had died of a heart attack. Fraley's book went on to sell 1.5 million 
copies. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1959, "Desilu Playhouse" produced a two-part semi-documentary based on the 
Ness-Fraley collaboration and from it sprang the initial TV episode of "The 
Untouchables" that year. 
</P>
<P>
 The documentary also became the basis for the first of the "Untouchables" 
feature films, released as "The Scarface Mob" in 1962 and starring Robert Stack 
as Ness. Stack had portrayed Ness on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, Kevin Costner brought Ness back to life in the Brian DePalma movie 
"The Untouchables," which earned an Academy Award for Sean Connery as a 
streetwise cop who played off of Costner's naivete. 
</P>
<P>
 The television series, which ran until 1963, was a favorite with viewers but 
not with several special-interest groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Parent-Teacher Assns. railed at its violence (two or three shootouts a show), 
Italian Americans were unhappy with so many of the characters bearing Italian 
names, and modern historians delighted in pointing out that many of the 
episodes featured Stack emptying his machine gun at crime lords of the late 
1930s, long after Eliot Ness had retired. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the producers appended a disclaimer to each episode that portions of 
"The Untouchables" had been fictionalized. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraley, who also wrote books about Jimmy Hoffa and the mysterious 1930 
disappearance of New York Supreme Court Justice Joseph Force Crater, was born 
in Philadelphia and raised in Woodsbury, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 He worked for UPI from 1940 to 1965, covering four Olympics and writing a 
column, "Today's Sports Parade."

PAT BUTTRAM; GENE AUTRY'S SIDEKICK, TV ACTOR, COMIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pat Buttram, the bulbous-nosed raconteur who rode Melody Ranch with Gene 
Autry, portrayed a shrewd landowner amid the verdant scenery of "Green Acres," 
and more recently had been an irreverent presence over the airwaves of Los 
Angeles, died Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Buttram died of kidney failure after a week's hospitalization at UCLA Medical 
Center, said longtime friend Bill Ward, general manager of radio stations KMPC 
and KLITE. 
</P>
<P>
 He was in his 80s, Ward said. 
</P>
<P>
 Buttram, who rode more daises than he did horses, was an omnipresent master of 
ceremonies for many Los Angeles organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 He probably was at his best when shredding his peers, particularly at the 
bimonthly luncheons of Pacific Pioneer Broadcasters, an organization of radio 
veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 His gentle sarcasm and slightly ribald tales were a fixture at Sportsmen's 
Lodge in Studio City and at other watering holes across the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 He also was the annual emcee for the Motion Picture and Television Fund's 
annual Golden Boot awards, where millions have been raised for the charity, and 
at political rallies for old friends. 
</P>
<P>
 He rode in parades, helped install stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame 
(including his own in 1988), and had been a regular fixture on Robert W. 
Morgan's morning KMPC radio program until recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Buttram said on taking the job in 1989 that he had gotten "tired of all the 
deejays in the morning quoting my jokes. . . . I decided to start getting 
paid." 
</P>
<P>
 Born Maxwell E. Buttram in Alabama, in a year he refused to divulge, he was 
the son of a circuit-riding minister and studied theology at Birmingham 
Southern College. He got into show business when a radio station hired him 
after the management saw him in a college play. 
</P>
<P>
 His big break came when he went to the Chicago World's Fair in 1933 and was 
interviewed in the audience at "National Barn Dance." Everything he said in 
that voice -- compared to a jackass with a sore throat -- got laughs and he was 
signed as a comic. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Autry first met more than 50 years ago in Chicago when both were 
appearing on the "National Barn Dance," the nation's first hillbilly radio 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 They remained close friends over the years, meeting each other for lunch at 
Lakeside Country Club and other spots several times a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was never at a loss for a good story or a good one-liner," Autry said 
Saturday. "I'm going to miss him a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Buttram appeared in more than 40 films, mostly as Autry's constantly amazed 
partner, and had done hundreds of TV appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1965 to 1971, Buttram played the annoying Mr. Haney on CBS' "Green 
Acres." It was Haney who sold a tumbledown farm to Oliver Wendell Douglas 
(Eddie Albert) and Lisa Douglas (Eva Gabor). 
</P>
<P>
 Buttram played himself on "The Gene Autry Show" from 1950 to 1956 on CBS, 
calling the boss "Mister Artery" while helping the singing cowboy keep the 
peace in the Southwest. Years earlier, from 1940-56, he also had been heard as 
Autry's sidekick on radio's "Gene Autry's Melody Ranch." 
</P>
<P>
 Buttram also appeared repeatedly on "The Ed Sullivan Show," Arthur Godfrey's 
programs, and in episodes of such programs as "Alfred Hitchcock Presents." 
</P>
<P>
 Buttram is survived by a daughter, Kerry Galgano. A private funeral is pending 
in Alabama.

CHANDRASHEKHARA SARASWATHI, 99; HINDU PONTIFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chandrashekhara Saraswathi, one of the five pontiffs of Hinduism, and revered 
among millions in India and Nepal for his emphasis on religious tolerance, died 
Saturday at age 99. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of thousands of Hindus thronged Saraswathi's retreat in Kanchipuram, 
40 miles southwest of Madras, after he died in his sleep there. 
</P>
<P>
 Saraswathi, popularly known as the Kanchi Sankaracharya or Guru of Kanchi, was 
considered one of the greatest sages of Hinduism. Sankaracharyas do not have 
powers like that of the Pope, but have substantial influence and their word is 
often regarded as absolute. 
</P>
<P>
 A monk picked Saraswathi to be pontiff at age 13. 
</P>
<P>
 He went through a grueling period of learning languages and religious texts. 
He spoke fluent English, French, Swedish and nearly a dozen Indian languages. 
</P>
<P>
 Saraswathi's emphasis on religious harmony won him wide respect among Muslims, 
whose relations with Hindus have been scarred by violence.

UNDERSTAFFING HAMPERS LAPD INVESTIGATORS, MEMO SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A top prosecutor says Los Angeles Police Department investigators working the 
high-crime Downtown divisions are too understaffed to do much real detective 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone comes to my house and breaks in, and the neighbor gets the license 
number of the car they drove away in, the detective doesn't even have time to 
follow that up," said Donald N. Eastman, head deputy of the district attorney's 
complaint division and author of a candid memo now circulating through the 
LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastman, whose unit handles felony cases for nine LAPD divisions, laid out his 
view of the troubled state of felony investigations in the memo, which he wrote 
in July at the request of Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastman's memo, which relies more on anecdotal than statistical evidence, also 
decries the low morale that has plagued officers for the last few years and 
says it affects the type of felony cases that are brought to his attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Eastman wrote: "LAPD patrol officers are not going into the 'line of fire.' We 
have been told so in person by police officers we chat with and we can see the 
phenomenon in the felonies that are submitted to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Officers' morale has been low in the wake of the 1991 Rodney G. King beating 
case, but Eastman said Saturday that the detectives' problems are due more to 
inadequate staffing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not to knock their morale, their energy or anything," Eastman said in 
an interview Saturday. "They don't have time to do the fundamental things we 
need them to do to do the job right."

IMAGE IS EVERYTHING, FROM BUGATTIS TO CHEVYS; AUTO SHOW: ELECTRIC CARS, 
$400,000 CARS AND HOT-RED CARS. ALL DISPLAYED AGAINST A BACKDROP OF THE MYTHIC 
OPEN ROAD. 
</P>

<P>
 The Greater Los Angeles Auto Show opened its doors to the public Saturday and 
if you think it was mere transportation that brought out the crowds then you 
have clearly just arrived in Southern California. From Mars. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, the more than 1,000 cars, trucks and vans on display at the Los 
Angeles Convention Center were widely assumed to be capable of transporting 
people from point A to points beyond -- although security refused to allow this 
premise to be tested -- but the 73rd not-necessarily-annual show was about much 
more than that. 
</P>
<P>
 It was about freedom, about dreams. It was about the Open Road, which was 
rumored to still exist in selected locales outside the Greater Los Angeles 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 It also was about how many grocery bags could comfortably be stuffed in the 
back of a minivan, and about all the body parts that would be protected by new 
and improved air bags. 
</P>
<P>
 It was about money, too. How does an estimated American list price of $400,000 
for Bugatti's EB-110 automobili grab you? 
</P>
<P>
 For the environmentally conscious, there were electric cars inside the center 
and outside, a giant chain saw balloon held aloft by seven members of the Rain 
Forest Action Network -- "Stop the Chop! Boycott Mitsubishi!" -- who were 
protesting the company's "chain saw massacre" of the rain forests. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, of course, there were lots of anatomically sound young women dressed 
in form-fitting clothing who talked about things like torque. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelia Cyr, for example, had just finished her spiel about the hot-red 1995 
Toyota Celica convertible when a reporter wanted to know was that 144 
foot-pounds of torque in the GT? 
</P>
<P>
 Cyr, who lives in Detroit and is about midway through her travels with the 
auto show circuit that runs from October through April, focused her eyes in the 
distance and silently began mouthing her bit until her tongue stopped at 
torque. That's 145 foot-pounds of torque, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cyr, 19, explained that her auto expertise did not come easily. "We have to 
take tests and everything with Toyota and get certified," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then a man who was passing by interrupted to ask the price of the Celica. She 
said she did not know. A woman wondered what kind of a back window it had. "I 
have no idea," Cyr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few feet away, Doug Gindlesberger, 13, was hunkered down behind the 
wheel of a gray Chevy Lumina Z-34 with his friend Victor Valdez, 14, riding 
shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
 "This car is just not made for performance," Doug said. "It's a family car." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, it's like something my mom would drive," Victor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug said the only reason he was even bothering with the Lumina was because he 
wanted to find a car for his grandmother. He figures he owes her one after she 
bought him a 1968 Charger last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sara Gindlesberger, however, was later found ogling a super sleek Camaro Z-28. 
"No, I like this ," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Image was big at the auto show, even omnipresent. You were what you drove, or 
what you would like to drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Hughes, president of Land Rover, said that although it was not 
included in the owner's manual, "You don't buy a Range Rover and sit in front 
of the TV all day." 
</P>
<P>
 Auto entrepreneur Reeves Callaway, unveiling his Callaway SuperNatural Camaro 
C-8 at the show, said his car was for the young man or woman "who likes to go 
fast and not spend a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
 And if your tastes run toward Rolls-Royces, Aston Martins, Ferraris, Lotuses, 
and Lamborghinis, the auto show honchos thoughtfully included an espresso bar / 
bakery stand in the small hall where those cars were displayed. If you couldn't 
actually drive a Rolls, at least you could eat like you could. 
</P>
<P>
 (For those of the Chevy persuasion, the auto show positioned a hot dog stand 
within easy walking distance of the display.) 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike the lower-end cars, where an open-door policy prevailed, expressing 
an interest in a six-figure automobile would not get you a chance to hop in the 
driver's seat. The cars were displayed like museum pieces, roped off, 
"investments" not to be tampered with by just anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnie Johnson, a vice president for Lotus, which is the parent company for the 
$400,000 Bugatti, said he had "a couple of serious people" come by to check out 
his cars. These customers, however, were not the type you would expect to see 
with a stamp on the back of their hand after paying the auto show's $5 
admission price. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come over with salesmen from Beverly Hills," Johnson said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Others were more down to earth. Mechanic Luis Chavez, 45, had his wife snap 
his picture as he sat behind the wheel of a black Dodge Ram 3500 pickup truck, 
his elbow resting on the window sill with a jaunty smile on his face. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez, who lives in Fontana, said he will send the photograph to his daughter 
in his native Honduras as a memento. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who did not wear their enthusiasm on their sleeves, there were many 
opportunities for soulful contemplation about how their lives would change if 
only, maybe just this once, they could own the car of their dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Stephen Kafka. He stood, alone, staring at a slowly revolving metallic 
gray Porsche 911 convertible. Round and round went the Porsche. Again, and 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a dog who hears the whistle when mere humans cannot, Kafka, an apparently 
mild-mannered accountant from the Westside, was tuned in. Just how would his 
life change if this baby were his? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd probably be broke," Kafka said. "I'd probably have to live in the car." 
</P>
<P>
 Over at the Volvo display, the pitch was much less sexy, but plenty corporal 
nonetheless. In place of beautiful women and flashy videos, crash dummies 
showed potential buyers what it might be like to have a head-on collision in a 
brand new Volvo. 
</P>
<P>
 Salesman Solomon Morris conceded that when he bought his first Volvo (a 740 
turbo) at age 23, the car wasn't quite up to his image as a cool-looking guy. 
"People used to look at me funny," Morris, 31, said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, however, Morris drives a Mazda today. After wrecking his Volvo on the 
second try, Morris said he cannot afford to buy one now.

SELLING SAFETY FOR CHILDREN; SELF-DEFENSE: COMPANIES OFFER CLASSES AND DEVICES 
FOR YOUNGSTERS TO PROTECT THEMSELVES. BUT SOME SAY FIRMS ARE PREYING ON 
PARENTS' FEARS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 First came crime, then came fear. 
</P>
<P>
 And then came the sales pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawking everything from self-defense classes for children to personal safety 
alarms -- a high-tech 1990s version of a police whistle -- entrepreneurs are 
targeting a new and increasingly fear-ridden audience: San Fernando Valley 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The cottage industry has popped up in the wake of the killing of an 8-year-old 
Woodland Hills girl and a series of assaults by a suspected child molester. 
Vendors selling hand-held alarms or passing out flyers promoting self-defense 
courses have positioned themselves outside meetings where parents have met with 
police to discuss the molester. A self-defense class was being held Saturday at 
Serrania Avenue Elementary School, not far from where the 8-year-old, Nicole 
Parker, was murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents and school officials see the trend as a positive sign, an 
indicator that society is recognizing the need to address the issue of child 
safety. At Fullbright Avenue Elementary School in Canoga Park, PTA officials 
plan to promote and sell personal safety alarms, both to increase safety and 
raise funds to air-condition classrooms. Chatsworth Park Elementary School 
began selling them last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really feel parents should know there are products out there that can keep 
their child relatively safe," said Jan Sandman, PTA president at Fullbright. 
"That's why we want to sell them." 
</P>
<P>
 Others say that some promoters are preying on the fears of parents, 
complicating the situation by suggesting that high-priced products and 
workshops are the solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen people taking an absolutely tragic set of circumstances and trying 
to capitalize on it," said Eric Rose, district director for Councilwoman Laura 
Chick, whose office organized many of the meetings with parents in the Valley. 
"What we've tried to do is get people to take this energy and concern and move 
it in a positive direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Hines, executive director and founder of Safe Moves, a county- and 
state-funded organization that promotes child safety, also says the trend is 
troubling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents are so panicked they're ready to pay or do anything to make sure 
their kids are going to be safer," she said. "It gives a false sense of 
security on the part of the parent and the child." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What has emerged is not only a moral debate on the ethics of marketing to an 
increasingly vulnerable group, but a practical debate on which methods are most 
effective in helping children to be safer. Are safety products and weekend 
workshops needed? Or is consistent education leading to a change in the 
behavior and attitudes of children and parents?  
</P>
<P>
 For the past two months, Leigh McDaniel of Granada Hills has visited parent 
groups and talked to school officials about personal safety products offered by 
Quorum International, a Phoenix-based company.  
</P>
<P>
 One product is the PAAL, a palm-size electronic alarm that emits a shrieking 
noise when activated. Another is the Personal Safety Net, a beeper-type device 
that monitors a child's movements and allows a parent to page a child. 
</P>
<P>
 At a cost of $30 to $40, the PAAL could be expensive, particularly for large 
families, McDaniel said. Even so, in one low-income Van Nuys neighborhood a 
distributor is "selling these like crazy," she said. "People are scraping 
together food money and everything else to supply these kids with these." 
</P>
<P>
 At Monroe High School, administrators see things differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was a financial exploitation of parents," said Assistant 
Principal Alice Parrish, who rejected Quorum's offer to sell the alarms as a 
fund-raiser. "My feeling is parents need to work with their children on safe 
practices. It is not the job of the public schools to promote people who are 
out to make a profit. I consider it scare tactics. You can educate without 
selling expensive classes and equipment." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, 11 boys and girls sat cross-legged on a blue mat in the Serrania 
auditorium, stared intently at four adults facing them and plotted ways to 
attack them.  
</P>
<P>
 The children, ages 6 to 10 1/2, outfitted in knee and elbow pads and wearing 
name tags, were taking part in a self-defense class that promised to teach them 
the skills and confidence to protect themselves if assaulted. The class, 
organized by a private company called The Defense Department, runs for 10 hours 
over a weekend and costs $125 per child. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Parents, who laughed and clapped for their children as they practiced gouging 
the eyes and grabbing the genitals of two pretend attackers, said they were 
buying peace of mind for themselves and increased awareness for their children. 
The children also yelled "No!" -- a simple but effective way to ward off an 
attack, the instructors said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it would help them ever, it's worth the money," said Eliza Hall of 
Northridge, who watched as her sons, Kyle, 10, and James, 6, fought off two 
large men wearing protective gear. "If it keeps them safe, it's worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone agrees that teaching children defense techniques is the best way 
to approach the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "You teach them a couple of things and they think they're going to be able to 
beat up Superman," Hines said. "I think that's the wrong message to be sending 
out." Even if a 9-year-old knows a couple of kicks, many adults will be able to 
attack and subdue the child anyway, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara L. Gallen, who runs the Los Angeles-based Defense Department and 
taught Saturday's class, disagrees. "They can defend themselves," she said. 
"It's not that hard to take out a human being. It is possible for a small 
person to take out a large person because human beings are very vulnerable." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallen uses the analogy of a 15-pound bowling ball, which when thrown, could 
incapacitate a large person. "I want you to think of yourselves as bowling 
balls," she told the class. "You could knock a person down with your energy." 
</P>
<P>
 For Hines, the trend toward products and costly workshops is disheartening. 
Safe Moves is a free program designed to offer students a long-term 
understanding of how to avoid and respond to hazards of all sorts, in the home, 
neighborhood and traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key is education," she said. "The reason education falls to the bottom of 
the list is because it's a long-term investment. It's not a thing you can touch 
or buy or put on the shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can change children's behavior so their safety becomes second nature," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District and the Los Angeles Police Department 
have not endorsed any of the products or workshops. "Everybody has to be guided 
by their own judgment," said Lt. Bud Merringer of the West Valley Division. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wesley Mitchell, chief of police for the school district, cautioned parents to 
remember that devices work only if children have the time and presence of mind 
to activate them. And real defense skills require practice -- particularly for 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 But some parents, such as Debbie Verdi of Reseda who organized Saturday's 
defense class and enrolled her 11- and 8-year-old daughters, say that any 
techniques they can offer their children are better than nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can do something," Verdi said. "I want them to have some resources to 
rely on. I'd rather them be cautious and prepared and aware. Then I'm not so 
scared."

BILL BOYARSKY: ETHICS COPS ALWAYS GET THEIR NUN -- AND THAT'S A PROBLEM 
</P>

<P>
 When most people think of a lobbyist, they visualize a flashy, glad-handing, 
free-spending kind of person, buying drinks and dinners for pols and dispensing 
campaign contributions to get favorable treatment for clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly nobody's vision of a lobbyist would be a nun in the plain skirt, 
blouse and sweater of the Sisters of Social Service, who spends her days in the 
streets of South-Central Los Angeles working to obtain better housing for the 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why Sister Diane Donoghue, executive director of the nonprofit 
Esperanza Community Housing Corp., was surprised to receive a letter from the 
Los Angeles City Ethics Commission proclaiming in bold type: 
</P>
<P>
 "This letter is to inform you that you may be subject to the city's lobbyist 
registration requirement. City law requires you to respond to this notice 
within 15 days of the date noted above." 
</P>
<P>
 Sister Diane having to register as a lobbyist? Hard to believe. That was my 
reaction when I was told of the letter recently by another woman also active in 
the low-cost housing cause, Jan Breidenbach, executive director of the Southern 
California Assn. of Non-Profit Housing. Breidenbach had received an identical 
letter. 
</P>
<P>
 As I inquired into the affair, I learned the letter was a defective product of 
City Hall's bureaucratic thinking and of a city lobby-control law that imposes 
unfair burdens on little guys while permitting powerful lobbyists to escape 
regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The law, requiring lobbyists to pay a $35 registration fee and file quarterly 
reports on incomes and expenses, was passed in 1967. It was supposed to reveal 
the names and financial resources of the powerful back-room lobbyists who shape 
city policies. These men and women earn their livings by guiding businesses 
through the regulatory maze and influencing legislation affecting them.  
</P>
<P>
 But the City Council, hostile to reform, made the ordinance so broad, so 
all-encompassing, that it was unenforceable. There could be hundreds or 
thousands of so-called lobbyists under its definition, far too many to regulate 
and prosecute. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance says you're a lobbyist if, "for pay or other consideration," you 
testify or write or speak to a city official to influence action on 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Think about the implications. Say you are a restaurant manager who testified 
against the city's anti-smoking ordinance. Under the law, you could be 
considered a lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
 You might also find yourself branded as a lobbyist if you are an official of 
an anti-abortion organization who is reimbursed for parking and mileage for 
driving to City Hall to fight for your cause. 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose that if I loaded a bunch of kids into a van, drove them to City Hall 
so they could ask for more money for playgrounds and then later treated the 
gang to Big Macs, they'd be considered lobbyists. A Big Mac certainly fits into 
what the ordinance calls a "consideration." 
</P>
<P>
 The law was so stupid that it was ignored for 20 years. But in 1991, voters, 
unhappy with City Hall's ethical standards, approved a law creating the City 
Ethics Commission to oversee lobbying, campaign financing and government 
ethics. The new ethics cops were given the job of enforcing the old law. 
</P>
<P>
 Unsuccessful in its attempt to get the council to pass a more practical 
lobby-control law, the Ethics Commission embarked on a scorched-earth 
enforcement of the old one. Obviously, the ethics cops have been trying to make 
a point about the law's shortcomings. It's an old trick that bureaucrats 
practice to get their way. Sister Diane got caught in the net. 
</P>
<P>
 She, Breidenbach and others are considered lobbyists because they appeared 
before the City Council last August to oppose Mayor Richard Riordan's plan to 
sell the Downtown public library to a Philip Morris subsidiary. They protested 
that the complicated financial features of the deal would end up reducing city 
funds now used to help build low-cost housing. 
</P>
<P>
 When she received the Ethics Commission letter, Sister Diane replied that she 
was not a lobbyist. "We do not act on behalf of individual clients but rather 
represent those persons who are economically disadvantaged and have need for 
decent affordable housing," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Benjamin Bycel, executive director of the Ethics Commission, why his 
cops were pursuing Sister Diane. He replied the law required it. "We have to be 
even-handed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The solution, he said, is to change the law. "For the last three years, the 
Ethics Commission has been working to junk the dinosaur lobbyist law we work 
under," he said. For example, the commission proposal would exempt anyone 
earning less than $12,000 a year for lobbying. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't expect such a sensible solution to pass. Other portions of the 
Ethics Commission proposal would tighten regulation of those still covered by 
the law. Powerful lobbyists have used their influence with the council to 
bottle up the proposal in a committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they (Sister Diane and the other housing advocates) want changes to 
happen, they have to talk to the City Council," said LeeAnn M. Pelham, deputy 
director for operations. "We are not the enemy." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the ethics cops are not exactly in hot pursuit of Sister Diane. And 
she's not on the run. "I think they will let it ride," she said. "I told them I 
would not pay the registration fee. I am not a lobbyist. That's dumb."

SCOTT HARRIS: THE BOOKING AGENT OF THE BIZARRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An autographed portrait of Maury Povich hangs on his office wall. "My hero," 
Christopher Darryn quips. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that he has a crush on Connie Chung. It's just that he was treated so 
well when he appeared on "The Maury Povich Show." Even by the often lurid 
standards of the genre, this program last October was, you might say, a bit 
incestuous. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a talk show about talk shows. Chris Darryn shared Povich's New York 
stage with a UFO abduction insurance salesman; an Ohio woman, named Irma 
Spriggs, willing to share a special diet secret; a fellow named Ronald Regen, 
who seems a bit fixated on Ronald Reagan, and a call girl/actress aptly dubbed 
Gabby, who is said to hold the record for TV talk show guest appearances. (So 
far, at least 12.) 
</P>
<P>
 "It was great," says Darryn, sitting at his computer in his Reseda office. 
"They give you the star treatment. They book your flight, send a car, put you 
in a nice hotel, give you a per diem. . . . It's all a very nice experience." 
</P>
<P>
 And what qualified Darryn for this show? 
</P>
<P>
 He's an agent of the odd, a middleman for the strange, the link between Gabby 
and Maury. 
</P>
<P>
 When Maury or Geraldo or Oprah or Montel or whoever need, say, an unrealized 
transsexual of lesbian orientation who is planning to run for President in 
1996, they call Chris Darryn. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That isn't a joke. Chris Darryn is the founder of the National Talk Show Guest 
Registry. Among the 1,800 people on his roster, he says, is someone who might 
be described as a lesbian trapped in a man's body. He/she is undergoing a sex 
change and dreams of living in the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 To be in this line of work, Darryn explains, "you have to have an open mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Darryn, 40, is an affable, soft-spoken and thoughtful man who lives with 
his wife, their 4-year-old daughter and a teen-age stepson in Encino. After 
years of struggling to make it in show biz, he seems to have found his niche. 
There was a time Darryn wanted to be a star. Now his work is built on the 
notion that just about everybody wants to be a star, if only for a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Warhol famously said that, in the media, everybody will be famous for 15 
minutes. Darryn's business suggests that people not only expect it -- they'll 
pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 For a fee of $3 per month, you too could join Darryn's registry. You could 
become a candidate to tell a national audience about anything from your 
collection of belly-button lint to some sort of deep, dark family weirdness 
involving an Arkansas state trooper. The fee, Darryn explains, "weeds out" 
people who aren't serious. 
</P>
<P>
 Fame isn't the only motive. Some people want to promote causes or products. 
Some, Darryn says, seem entirely altruistic, convinced that sharing their own 
miseries may help others avoid a similar fate. In some case, revenge is the 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got women who want to expose their spouse for the dirty, cheating rat 
that he is on national TV." 
</P>
<P>
 A glance at the TV schedule demonstrates that there's a ravenous appetite for 
this stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 "Talk shows work on the premise that one person's misery is another's 
inspiration," Darryn says. "People either look at it and gain strength. They 
think, 'They can survive despite all their troubles.' Or they say, 'Thank God 
I'm not that pitiful.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Darryn took a roundabout way to his odd calling. In the '70s, the Boston 
native did stand-up comedy. After moving to Hollywood, he did shtick as tour 
guide at Universal Studios. He tried acting. He wrote sitcom pilots. As for 
success, it was modest at best. 
</P>
<P>
 He landed research jobs for radio shows and TV talk programs that died an 
early death. Once such shows were canceled, Darryn would be out of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured there's got to be a better way -- to work for three or four shows 
at a time, so if one gets canceled, I'm OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Eight years ago, he founded The Research Department to do just that. He's the 
whole department. Instead of working for three or four shows, more than a dozen 
use the service. His clients range from such shows as "Unsolved Mysteries" and 
"Hard Copy" to "The Tonight Show" and National Public Radio's "All Things 
Considered." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes he gets odd requests. One time, Sally Jessy Raphael's staff asked 
him whether he could find a small newspaper story about a man with a foot 
fetish who would phone women and persuade them to break the heels off their 
high-heeled shoes while he listened. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryn found it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know," he added, "I think that guy was in Glendale." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The talk show guest registry, Darryn says, was a logical extension of his 
research work. Arlene June Galloway, a 74-year-old Hesperia woman dubbed "The 
Queen of Garbage," is another member of the registry. 
</P>
<P>
 Galloway pays her $3 per month because she wanted to make her TV comeback. 
Back in the early 1960s, when she was known as "Burbank's Lady of Discards," 
Galloway appeared on "Steve Allen's Playhouse" and "The Dinah Shore Show," 
demonstrating how she could recycle bits of garbage into clothing and 
decorations. For example, she makes earrings out of roll-on deodorant 
applicator balls. 
</P>
<P>
 Galloway clearly enjoys the attention. And she has a message about the 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "People laughed at me for decades, until my predictions came true," she says. 
"We've got to start doing something about our garbage!" 
</P>
<P>
 Now it looks like Galloway, 30 years after she left Steve Allen in hysterics, 
will be recycled herself. "The Tonight Show" is interested. And so is 
"Entertainment Tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Why does E.T. care? The same reason Maury Povich did. 
</P>
<P>
 And if Chris Darryn soon has a picture of John Tesh on his wall, it's not 
because he has a thing for Connie Selleca. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Harris' column appears Tuesday, Thursday and Sunday.

THE TABLES ARE TURNED AS ATTORNEY FACES TRIAL; COURTS: FOLLOWING A GRAND JURY 
INDICTMENT, LEONARD MILSTEIN IS CHARGED WITH PERJURY, CONSPIRACY TO OBSTRUCT 
JUSTICE AND BRIBERY OF A WITNESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was hard to tell that roles were reversed for Leonard R. Milstein on a 
recent morning, as he sat inside the criminal courthouse in downtown Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in a dark suit with a briefcase at his side, Milstein looked like a 
typical attorney waiting for a hearing to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike other legal proceedings he had attended over the last two decades 
as a lawyer, this time the 49-year-old Milstein was the defendant, facing 
charges including perjury, conspiracy to obstruct justice and bribery of a 
witness. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, 1991, a Los Angeles County grand jury indicted Milstein, formerly of 
Woodland Hills, on charges stemming from his role in defending Brad Millward, 
who had faced the death penalty for the execution-style slayings of two men in 
the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Millward was accused in the killings of Bruce Gruber, 28, of Yucca Valley and 
Albert Dulyea, 37, of Norwalk, who were shot July 5, 1987, at a desert site 
east of Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A jury acquitted Millward of killing Dulyea, whose body was found in 
Millward's garage, but it deadlocked on the Gruber slaying. Millward agreed to 
plead guilty to voluntary manslaughter in that case and was sentenced to eight 
years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors allege in a grand jury transcript that Milstein arranged for jail 
inmate Albert Gutierrez to give false testimony on behalf of Millward in 
exchange for a promise to represent Gutierrez in an unrelated criminal matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez testified during Millward's trial that he had worked on the car of 
Daniel Lucero, the chief prosecution witness, following the slayings and that 
he had discovered rifle ammunition in the trunk of Lucero's car that might have 
been similar to ammunition used in the killings. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez's statements, coupled with testimony from a firearms expert for the 
defense, suggested that it was Lucero -- not Millward -- who had shot Gruber 
and Dulyea, wrote Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Richard C. Neal in a ruling 
related to the Millward case. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said another jail inmate, Charles Haas, had contacted them during 
the trial and told them that he also had been approached by Millward and 
Milstein to testify in Millward's defense. Haas allegedly told authorities he 
initially agreed, but later changed his mind. Prosecutors said Haas, fearing 
for his safety, refused their request to testify during Millward's trial about 
his conversations with Millward and Milstein. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Haas later turned up fatally shot in the same desert area where Gruber and 
Dulyea were killed, prosecutors said. An investigation into his killing is 
ongoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Milstein referred all questions to his attorney, Michael M. Crain, who 
described his client as a totally innocent man who "didn't knowingly take part 
in anything that was improper." 
</P>
<P>
 "Leonard Milstein was taken advantage of," Crain said. 
</P>
<P>
 Records on file with the California secretary of state show Milstein is 
president of Central Coast Legal Services in San Luis Obispo. He also is listed 
as owner of a home in Arroyo Grande in San Luis Obispo County, according to 
property records. 
</P>
<P>
 Formerly based in Woodland Hills, Milstein gained prominence in the San 
Fernando Valley in the 1980s as chairman of the now defunct Valley School 
Project, which circulated petitions that called for Valley schools to leave the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 The perjury case against Milstein is scheduled to return to court Feb. 4 with 
a pretrial hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they grew suspicious of Milstein for several reasons, 
including his accusation that Lucero, the prosecution witness, was the real 
killer. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucero testified during Millward's 1989 trial that he was driving with his 
wife and two children along Avenue P when he saw Millward holding a gun several 
inches from Gruber's head. Lucero said he heard a gunshot, then saw Gruber fall 
to the ground and Millward flee. 
</P>
<P>
 After witnessing the shooting, Lucero said, he and his family and passersby 
picked up the victim and drove him to the Antelope Valley sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
 But in his opening statements during that trial, defense attorney Milstein 
charged that Lucero actually intended to kill Millward, but accidentally shot 
one of the victims -- Gruber -- instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Milstein told the jury that Lucero brought Gruber to authorities to cover up 
his role in the crime. He charged that Lucero, Gruber and other members of an 
Antelope Valley drug-trafficking ring killed Dulyea because they thought he and 
Millward were federal drug enforcement agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Milstein's portrayal of Lucero as the shooter "raised doubts on Danny Lucero's 
testimony," Deputy Dist. Atty. Bob Foltz said. "As a result, there was a hung 
jury on the one count and an acquittal on the other." 
</P>
<P>
 Around the same time, a sheriff's deputy assigned to a Los Angeles County jail 
found among an inmate's possessions a picture of Lucero as well as one of 
Milstein's business cards with the locations of the slayings written on the 
back, said Deputy Dist. Atty. John Portillo, who prosecuted the Millward case. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy, for no legitimate reason, was in possession of these items and was 
trying to pass them to another inmate," Portillo said. "At the same time, we 
noticed all of Millward's witnesses were coming out of the county jail." 
</P>
<P>
 The last straw, Portillo said, was when Haas, the inmate, contacted 
authorities during the trial and told them that he had been recruited by 
Millward and Milstein to testify on Millward's behalf in exchange for $3,500. 
After first agreeing to participate in the scheme, Haas told Portillo that he 
changed his mind and chose not to perjure himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Portillo recalled asking Haas, who was serving a prison sentence himself, if 
he would be willing to testify at Millward's trial about the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said no," Portillo said of Haas. "He said he would be dead if he did." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after his release from prison, in December, 1989, Haas was found 
executed with a shotgun blast through his chest in the area of the desert where 
Gruber and Dulyea had been discovered, Foltz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether there's a connection or not, who knows?" Portillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say that despite their mounting suspicions, the case against 
Milstein did not come together until Gutierrez contacted authorities and 
confessed to perjuring himself during Millward's trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the witness who was needed," Foltz said. "He was the key to the whole 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez told a federal grand jury that Milstein contacted him and, in return 
for Gutierrez's testimony at Millward's trial, offered to represent him against 
charges of receiving stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he would talk to the judge and get me off the hook," Gutierrez said, 
according to the grand jury transcript. "He said that he knew the judge 
personally and that it wouldn't be no problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez said Milstein had him falsely testify that following the murders he 
had worked on Lucero's car at his auto repair business and that he found the 
large-caliber rifle ammunition inside the vehicle, according to the grand jury 
transcript. A defense expert had testified earlier that a similar type of 
ammunition had been used to kill Gruber and Dulyea. 
</P>
<P>
 To bolster his testimony, Milstein asked Gutierrez to write up 14 false 
invoices that purportedly confirmed that Gutierrez had worked on Lucero's car 
in September, 1987, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators later learned that the invoices Gutierrez had presented had not 
been manufactured until December, 1987, three months after the work allegedly 
had been performed, Foltz said. 
</P>
<P>
 After testifying, Gutierrez became disgruntled when Milstein quit representing 
him in the unrelated case, Foltz said. Gutierrez subsequently pleaded guilty 
and was sentenced to 28 months in prison in that case. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just didn't show up any more," Gutierrez testified before a grand jury. 
"He stopped representing me because he didn't need me anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Milstein's attorney, Crain, confirmed that his client represented Gutierrez in 
an unrelated criminal matter, but declined to comment on the details of the 
incident. Crain said Milstein is the real victim in this case. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't know there was any perjured testimony given in the trials or that 
any documents were phony or he never would have presented them," Crain said. 
"He is the victim of false statements made against him by career criminals and 
other dregs of society." 
</P>
<P>
 Foltz said the fact that Gutierrez has a criminal record actually will work in 
favor of prosecutors when the case hits trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only a crook would do this . . . testify falsely," Foltz said. "If the guy 
wasn't dirty, it would be harder to believe." 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent interview, Foltz said no clear motive for Milstein's alleged 
actions has been identified. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's only one person on the planet who knows the truth," said Foltz as he 
pointed to Milstein sitting across the hallway -- this time a defendant waiting 
for his hearing to begin.

DOWNTOWN L.A. SHOPPERS PUT WATCHFULNESS HIGH ON LIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT J. LOPEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 With one arm wrapped around her little boy, Patricia Flores was not taking any 
chances Saturday as she flipped through a row of compact discs at a store in 
the busy Broadway shopping district downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm taking extra care because it's really strange what happened to those two 
boys," said Flores, 17, holding tightly to 3-year-old Mariano, who was decked 
out for a day of shopping in his cowboy boots, black jeans and freshly pressed 
white shirt. "When you come down here, you don't know what can happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Broadway is Southern California's major Latino shopping area, and on Saturday 
it seemed that just about everybody was talking about the strange tale of a day 
laborer who said he had found two missing boys in the downtown area in the last 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 "For all I know, that guy could be going around looking for little kids," said 
Francisco Guillen, who was visiting from Escondido with his three children and 
two nieces, ages 3 to 8. While his wife and sister strolled through the Grand 
Central Marketplace, Guillen stood guard as the children played outside. "You 
can't take your eyes away for one minute -- because the next thing you know, 
they're gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Police, meanwhile, said Saturday that there were no new leads in the 
investigation of Enrique Palma Lopez. The 31-year-old day laborer was hailed as 
a hero after he said he found 4-year-old Matthew Vera wandering along Pico 
Boulevard in early December. Matthew had vanished 40 hours earlier from the 
downtown Greyhound bus station. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez resurfaced again Monday, when he called authorities saying that he had 
found 3-year-old Andrew Rodriguez, who disappeared Christmas Day from a 
Broadway video arcade. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators, who said they were skeptical that the two cases were mere 
coincidence, questioned Lopez for 10 hours last week but released him because 
there was not enough evidence to file charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Also last week, police confirmed that Lopez was arrested in 1987 on suspicion 
of lewd behavior with a child under 14. He was never charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the festive atmosphere on Broadway -- where the rhythmic sounds of salsa 
and cumbia blared from discotecas and shoppers perused displays featuring 
everything from gold chains to exotic chilies -- the thought of a potential 
kidnaper roaming the streets weighed heavily on parents' minds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Me and my wife play tag team -- she shops, and I watch the children," said 
Jose Prieto of Downey as he hovered over his 5-year-old twins, Robert and 
Roger. The family was inside a jewelry store. 
</P>
<P>
 Skateboards in hand, the two boys wanted to go outside and play, but Prieto 
would have none of that. "You're staying by me," he said.

VALLEY BRIEFING: LAWS OF THE LAND; MAKING RULES IS CITY HALL'S BUSINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's been said that making laws is like making sausage -- you don't want to 
see how it's done. Indeed, at Los Angeles City Hall -- just like in the state 
Legislature or Congress -- it can be a messy, frustrating and time-consuming 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is also a basic function of the Los Angeles City Council, which molds 
ideas put forth by council members or city officials -- or perhaps even those 
of constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of a new law that prohibits the sale of knives, blades or other 
stabbing weapons to anyone younger than 18 years old, the idea was brought to 
Councilman Hal Bernson by a woman in his northwest San Fernando Valley district 
who discovered her 13-year-old son had purchased three knives from a corner 
liquor store. 
</P>
<P>
 Some proposals take long journeys before becoming law, with dozens of 
revisions or many trips between council committees. Bernson's knife measure 
followed a relatively straight path. Here's how it made the trip into law: 
</P>
<P>
 Step 1: Bernson introduces the knife ordinance Jan. 15, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members introduce ordinances by writing a brief description of the 
idea and providing copies to the city clerk's office, the full City Council and 
posting copies in the City Council Chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Step 2: Council President John Ferraro refers the knife proposal to the Public 
Safety Committee the same day. 
</P>
<P>
 The council president sends the proposal to at least one of 15 council 
committees, ranging from Public Safety to Government Efficiency to Budget and 
Finance. Each council member chairs a three-member committee. The president's 
decision can be overruled by a vote of at least eight council members. A 
proposed ordinance can be reviewed by more than one committee at the request of 
the council president or a committee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Step 3: The Public Safety Committee forwards the knife ordinance to the city 
attorney's office on Jan. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Either the full council or a council committee can refer a proposal to the 
city attorney's office, which must draft the legal language for the measure. In 
this case, the city attorney returned Bernson's proposal to the committee and 
requested clarifications by April 8. Four days later, a committee aide wrote 
back with the requested clarifications. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Step 4: The knife proposal is sent to the city's Police Commission, which 
approves it Aug. 24. The Public Safety Committee then endorses the measure Nov. 
8 and sends it to the full council. 
</P>
<P>
 The committees can refer proposed ordinances to a city agency for further 
review. But in most cases the committee holds a public hearing on the idea and 
then brings the matter back to the entire council with a recommendation, a 
rejection or request for modifications. The committee can also forward the item 
to the council without comment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Step 5: The City Council adopts the measure unanimously 15 to 0 and forwards 
it to the mayor on Nov. 16 for final approval. 
</P>
<P>
 When the proposed ordinance returns to the entire City Council, it can be 
adopted on the first time around by a unanimous vote with at least 12 members 
present. If the proposed ordinance gets majority support but at least one 
council member votes against it, the proposed ordinance must come back a week 
later for a "second reading." The ordinance needs a simple majority on the 
second reading to be approved and referred to the mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Step 6: Mayor Richard Riordan signs the knife law Nov. 23. It's published in a 
local newspaper on Dec. 1 and takes effect Jan. 1, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 If the mayor signs it, the ordinance is published in a local newspaper and 
becomes law after 30 days. If the mayor does nothing for 10 calendar days, it 
is then published and becomes law automatically. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Step 7: In the case of the knife law, Riordan chose not to exercise his veto 
power. Had he done so, the council could have attempted to override the veto 
within 60 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinances that have to do with certain taxes, zoning changes or modifications 
to retirement benefits require at least 10 votes to override the veto. Other 
ordinances, such as General Plan amendments, emergency laws and certain taxes, 
require 12 votes to override a veto. Ballot Measures 
</P>
<P>
 Some laws are enacted by the voters. Here's how they get on the ballot: 
</P>
<P>
 * To put an initiative measure on a citywide ballot, a person or group would 
need to collect signatures of 15% of the voters in the last mayor's race, or 
87,413 signatures. A person collecting such signatures also can opt to avoid 
the citywide ballot and have the initiative put before the City Council, which 
would decide its fate. 
</P>
<P>
 * To place an item on the ballot to overturn an ordinance adopted by the City 
Council, a person would need to collect the signatures of 10% of the voters in 
the last mayor's race, or 58,275. 
</P>
<P>
 * Once a measure is on the ballot, it requires a simple majority or a 
two-thirds vote in the case of certain tax or bond measures. 
</P>
<P>
 * The City Council can also place an item on the citywide ballot.

DRAMATIC OPPORTUNITIES; REDONDO BEACH CAMP GIVES YOUNG THESPIANS AN OUTLET FOR 
FUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While working with the elite Children's Theatre Factory in Santa Monica in 
1988, drama teacher Pamela Zorotovich-Ament said she thought of starting a 
similar program for less-privileged young people who had few, if any, creative 
outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great thing -- a drama day camp -- but this one was mostly for 
Westside, affluent families," she said. "I wanted to do something that wasn't 
going to be just recreation for the rich." 
</P>
<P>
 With that idea in mind, the Torrance resident approached the city of Redondo 
Beach to begin a day-camp summer program for about 30 children, which 
culminated in a few performances of one-act plays based on Hans Christian 
Andersen fairy tales. 
</P>
<P>
 To Zorotovich-Ament's surprise, 55 children -- nearly twice the number she 
anticipated -- signed up, and three more instructors were hired on the spot. 
The rest is history. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in its sixth season, the drama camp last fall expanded year-round with the 
addition of the off-season Youth Theater Program, an abbreviated after-school 
version of the camp that focuses on stage adaptations of classic literary 
works. 
</P>
<P>
 After launching the off-season program with Israel Horovitz's stage adaptation 
of Charles Dickens' "A Christmas Carol," Zorotovich-Ament is now in rehearsal 
for George Orwell's bleakly futuristic "1984," which will open in March. 
</P>
<P>
 The combined programs now include about 100 children, between the ages of 6 to 
16, who perform a repertoire of 15 plays and musicals mainly, Zorotovich-Ament 
said, to have fun. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the best experience of my life," said 13-year-old Megan Shea, a 
five-year veteran of the program. "I was nervous when I first started, but now 
it's really comfortable. You can go as high as you want here. They elevate you 
if you want to be elevated. I started out as a troll in 'The Hobbit,' and I 
have to admit, I was pretty bad. I'm doing a lot more now." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Shea: "It's for everybody. Pam doesn't care if you want to be an actor, 
just as long as you try." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With her bubbly persona and ready laugh, Zorotovich-Ament, 36, is nothing if 
not a motivator, a woman who scarcely seems to know the meaning of the word 
can't.  
</P>
<P>
 At a recent rehearsal in Perry Park's auditorium, which serves as the 
program's playhouse, she stood before the stage shouting encouragement to 
groups of players as they struggled to enact improvisations suggested by the 
entire group. 
</P>
<P>
 As the actors fell to the floor in violent deaths, made animal noises, boarded 
spaceships and erected Martian houses made of cloth, Zorotovich-Ament 
applauded, laughing heartily and commenting on innovative performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Though some of the scenes made little dramatic sense, each group of three 
tackled its project with gusto, skipping, flinging themselves on prop furniture 
and generally taking to the stage as if it were a playground. 
</P>
<P>
 Zorotovich-Ament knows from experience how to create something out of nearly 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 On a shoestring budget, the camp in its first year staged a full production of 
a musical written by the children and based on Andersen tales. Though offered 
through the Redondo Beach Parks and Recreation Department, the drama camp 
receives no public funding. 
</P>
<P>
 It relies entirely on fees, which are $375 for 10 weeks in the summer and $40 
for eight weeks of the off-season Youth Theater Program. The program must also 
give the city 10% of its budget -- about $56,000 annually -- to rent the 
auditorium. The city is planning to offer scholarships for drama campers next 
summer, but amounts and numbers haven't been established. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to voice, dance, gymnastics and acting technique, the children 
learn how to build and design sets, make costumes, write lyrics and scripts. 
The children take turns performing, operating lights and sound boards and 
directing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ashleigh Beck, 12, said she likes the fact that instructors "aren't there to 
baby-sit you." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot of work, like school, and you're responsible for doing your 
homework," she said. "It gives you more confidence. It's not really about 
acting. It opens you up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Zorotovich-Ament fell in love with theater relatively late in life. After a 
stint in the Air Force, she enrolled at Harbor College in 1979. Walking past a 
campus theater one afternoon, she spied an audition notice and was seized with 
a desire to try out. Although she didn't get a part, she wound up being a 
director's assistant and the love affair with theater began. 
</P>
<P>
 Zorotovich-Ament now recruits many of her friends as summer instructors. The 
staff peaks at 10 during the summer with eight instructors and two part-time 
assistants, although the challenge of coordinating classes, rehearsals and 
production schedules for 40 to 90 young people is still formidable. 
</P>
<P>
 Summer is the time for full-blown musicals and fairy tales such as "The Pied 
Piper," "Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat" and "Cinderella." 
</P>
<P>
 But the off-season serves as a counterpoint, an opportunity for the children 
to delve into deeper works such as "1984," which will have an eight-day run. 
</P>
<P>
 Such weighty material doesn't faze Kimberly Parsons, 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like all of it -- the dancing, singing, acting, reading scripts," said the 
seventh-grader, who has a lead role in "1984." "It's helped me a lot 
personally. When I first started camp, I was just looking for something to do 
over the summer. I wasn't really interested in acting, and I didn't even like 
to talk much. Being in this (program) has helped me overcome my shyness. Plus 
you make a lot of friends." 
</P>
<P>
 For 10-year-old Daniel Franks, the thrill of being on stage has sharpened his 
desire to become a professional actor. "I'm not sure what kind of actor I'll 
be, but this will help my career," he said. "You get to do it all here. Some 
kids have agents and all that, but most people just have fun."

AEROSPACEP WORKERS WILL BE RETRAINED WITH GRANT; EMPLOYMENT: MORE THAN 2,000 
SOUTH BAY LAYOFFS ARE EXPECTED THIS YEAR. MUCH OF THE $2 MILLION IN FEDERAL 
FUNDS WILL BE USED TO HELP ENGINEERS BECOME MATH AND SCIENCE TEACHERS.

<P>
 More than 2,000 aerospace workers expected to be laid off this year will be 
eligible for specialized job training and other employment programs through a 
$2-million federal grant awarded last week to the South Bay Private Industry 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The money, which will be administered by the city of Inglewood on behalf of 
the industry council, was awarded by the U.S. Department of Labor's Job 
Training Partnership Act defense conversion fund. Inglewood is a member of the 
council, a consortium of local government and business representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 In its application for the grant, the council estimated that about 2,200 
aerospace workers, mostly from Northrop Corp., which has offices in El Segundo 
and Hawthorne, and TRW in Redondo Beach, would lose their jobs by December as a 
result of defense spending cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Vogel, executive director of the private council, said a large part of the 
award will be used for a program to retrain engineers as math and science 
teachers. But he could not provide a breakdown of how all the money will be 
spent until the council determines specifically how many workers it will serve 
and what their needs are. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're going to do is gear it to the individual," he said. "If a 
particular individual is not an engineer and is maybe somebody who might match 
to being a truck driver, then we'll go out and get truck-driver training for 
that individual." 
</P>
<P>
 Vogel estimated that the figures given to the U.S. Department of Labor for the 
grant are now out of date and that layoffs will exceed 2,200, although 
aerospace corporation executives declined to provide figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop spokesman James Hart said that although the company had not completed 
employment projections for this year, "Most likely, we are going to have to 
continue to cut costs where we can and sometimes, unfortunately, that does 
include job reductions." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 TRW spokesman Daniel McClain declined to comment on the council's projections 
but painted a somewhat brighter employment picture, saying: "If existing 
programs remain funded according to plan, the company expects employment to 
remain level." 
</P>
<P>
 Vogel predicted that the council would be able to place most laid-off workers 
in existing financial management, job search and career transition workshops. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-year teacher training program is conducted jointly with California 
State University Dominguez Hills and is the only one of its kind in the South 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The program focuses on retraining laid-off aerospace workers who have at least 
a bachelor's degree in math, engineering or science to be high school teachers. 
Twenty-five students will begin the first class Monday . 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a natural way to retrain certain people," Vogel said. "Aerospace workers 
have a background in the math and science fields, and there are many people 
that have always had in the back of their mind that they'd like to teach." 
</P>
<P>
 The class also is intended to meet the state's critical need for math and 
science teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now the university pipeline is producing only about half of what the 
state needs every year," said Gary Levine, associate dean of the university's 
Extended Education program. The state needs between 700 to 1,000 math and 
science teachers yearly, Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sure that all of the people in this (class) will be able to be 
employees in Southern California," Levine said. "These people will all be 
teaching within a year."

TRAFFIC PROMPTS INGLEWOOD PARKING BAN; REGULATION: CITY TRIES A TEMPORARY PLAN 
THAT PROHIBITS LEAVING CARS ON PRAIRIE AVENUE, WHICH HAS SEEN 5,100 MORE 
VEHICLES PER DAY SINCE THE CENTURY FREEWAY OPENED. MERCHANTS SAY THE 
RESTRICTION WILL HURT BUSINESS. 
</P>

<P>
 For years Inglewood officials looked forward to the opening of the Century 
Freeway, saying it would be a boon to a community that depends on hundreds of 
thousands of visitors for its economic well-being. 
</P>
<P>
 The city boasts two major hospitals, as well as Hollywood Park Race Track and 
the Great Western Forum, home to the NBA's Lakers and the NHL's Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 But since the freeway opened in October, Inglewood and other cities along its 
17.3-mile route between Los Angeles International Airport and Norwalk have 
found that with economic promise comes traffic congestion. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic along Prairie Avenue, one of Inglewood's major north-south business 
corridors, has increased 14%, from 37,400 cars a day to 42,500, according to 
city traffic engineer Parviz Koupai. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a capacity problem now," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To alleviate the congestion, the city plans to experiment with a curbside 
parking ban along Prairie beginning Saturday. The ban will end Feb. 15, when 
city officials will evaluate its impact. 
</P>
<P>
 But some merchants along Prairie do not have parking lots and are worried that 
a permanent ban will hurt their businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are going to see 'No parking anytime' and they're going to keep 
going," said Sam Hoggard, who owns a hardware store at Prairie and 103rd 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoggard said he already has a hard time making parking available for his 
customers because the employees of neighboring merchants take up space on the 
street in front of his store. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabiola Lacayo, manager of the Ronda Beeper store, added that if the parking 
ban becomes permanent, the business may have to relocate. Lacayo said she would 
regret moving. "All the people know us here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic crews have not measured the flow of cars along Crenshaw Boulevard, 
Inglewood's other north-south road with a freeway interchange. But Koupai said, 
"My hunch is that it has increased also." 
</P>
<P>
 Koupai said he and other officials knew that they might have a traffic problem 
along Prairie because it runs north from the freeway toward dense residential 
areas. For commuters anxious to avoid the crowded San Diego Freeway, especially 
the stretch adjacent to LAX, Prairie serves as an easy route into Baldwin Hills 
and Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the freeway opened, Koupai said, commuters were traveling through the 
city via one of Inglewood's three major east-west streets, Imperial Highway and 
Manchester and Century boulevards. All three streets link the Harbor and San 
Diego freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in Hawthorne and El Segundo, the two other South Bay cities that 
have Century Freeway interchanges, say there has been no increase in traffic 
since the opening of the freeway, which is officially known as the Glenn M. 
Anderson (105) Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeway ramps into Hawthorne and El Segundo, which do not lead to large 
residential areas, are counted on to attract business development. 
</P>
<P>
 At the eastern end of the freeway, residents in Downey, Lynwood and Norwalk 
are complaining about increased traffic on surface streets. 
</P>
<P>
 In Downey, scores of cars flood Bellflower Boulevard at rush hour, forcing 
drivers to wait through up to four cycles of an oh-so-slow traffic light before 
it hits green. Officials say rush-hour traffic along Bellflower was light 
before the freeway opened. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lynwood, the city's only freeway exit -- Long Beach Boulevard -- is 
becoming increasingly congested, and commuters are clogging tiny residential 
streets to the south in an effort to escape the crush. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Norwalk, where the highway ends at the San Gabriel River (605) Freeway, 
hundreds of motorists opt for nearby surface streets each evening to avoid the 
huge backups caused by the timed off-ramp signal that lets just three cars 
through at a time. 
</P>

 Traffic along Prairie Avenue, one of Inglewood's major north-south business 
corridors, has increased 14% since the Century Freeway (105) opened in October.

MAN BOOKED IN DEATH OF PEDESTRIAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Van Nuys man has been booked for vehicular manslaughter in the death of a 
pedestrian on Riverside Drive in Sherman Oaks, police said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Marsha L. Morse, 52, of Sherman Oaks died just after 9 p.m. Friday in the 
accident that occurred on Riverside just west of Mary Ellen Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Morse had just gotten out of her parked car when she was hit and 
knocked 40 feet by the Cadillac driven by Randolph G. Higgins. 
</P>
<P>
 After striking Morse, Higgins' car continued westbound on Riverside and struck 
three parked cars, said Officer John Baby of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's San Fernando Valley traffic division. 
</P>
<P>
 Higgins, 44, who police said had been drinking, suffered lacerations to the 
right eye. He was booked at Van Nuys Jail, Baby said.

PROPOSED RAGING WATERS EXPANSION GETTING A ROUGH RIDE; RECREATION: BONELLI PARK 
GROUP VOWS TO FIGHT ANY ATTEMPTS TO CLEAR THE WAY FOR MORE PARKING AND DEVELOP 
MORE OPEN SPACE AT AMUSEMENT PARK SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW LEPAGE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A citizens group that has repeatedly fought attempts to further develop Frank 
G. Bonelli Regional Park is making waves again, this time to prevent the 
popular Raging Waters amusement park from expanding. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, Raging Waters, a 50-acre water-slide attraction in the 
northwest corner of the 2,000-acre Bonelli Park, has been drawing huge crowds 
on peak summertime weekends. Owners of the amusement park say existing parking 
facilities -- three dirt lots from which patrons must be bused to the 
attractions -- are overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners want to increase parking by paving and possibly expanding those 
dusty lots, and they hope to boost attendance and profits by adding a 6- to 
10-acre retail "village" and nine more acres of water attractions in an area 
now used for parking. 
</P>
<P>
 But they know their proposal is in for a rough ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the 8-year-old Coalition to Preserve Bonelli Park have vowed to 
fight any attempts to clear the way for more parking or develop more open 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 San Dimas City Councilman Denis Bertone, co-chairman of the coalition, said 
its struggle to block further development in the park is hampered by the 
county's insistence that Raging Waters stays. Ranking among the biggest single 
revenue producers in the county park system, Raging Waters contributed more 
than $800,000 in rent to the county's general fund last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But coalition members say that money comes at too high a price. 
</P>
<P>
 "This proposed expansion of commercial development may enhance Raging Waters, 
but you're taking valuable parkland away from the public," Bertone said. "We're 
not going to get any more park space in the San Gabriel Valley -- it's too 
precious." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials, who are now considering the proposed expansion during a 
revision of the Bonelli Park master plan, say the coalition's interests must be 
balanced with the interests of residents throughout the county. Bonelli, after 
all, is a regional, rather than a community park, they point out. 
</P>
<P>
 The park accommodates, in addition to 10-year-old Raging Waters, a variety of 
concessionaires. There are 500 RV sites, a family tent area, a golf course, hot 
tubs and developed picnic areas. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, cash-strapped county park officials have opened Puddingstone 
Reservoir to Jet Ski rentals and national drag-boat races in addition to 
longtime recreational fishing. About a third of the park is developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Raging Waters, which has a lease with the county that runs to 2035, hopes to 
win approval within the next year from the County Board of Supervisors to 
expand. Rent is based on a percentage of gross sales, so theoretically, the 
county would get more money if the expansion brings in more customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Amusement park officials maintain that their attendance, which has increased 
over the past decade while Bonelli Park's attendance has declined in recent 
years, proves the park is popular countywide. They say coalition members 
represent a boisterous minority in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, said Kent Lemasters, general manager of Raging Waters, the 
amusement park is one of the East San Gabriel Valley's largest employers, with 
about 500 full- and part-time seasonal jobs. Most of the jobs at the park, 
which is open 135 days a year, are taken by teen-agers on summer break. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the growing popularity of the amusement park, Raging Waters officials 
said, shareholders have not been paid dividends since the current owner, an 
investor group, took control in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials say that to maintain their current customer base and attract 
new patrons they must build more rides, pave the dirt parking areas, and add 
roughly 1,000 more spaces to the 3,300 or so available now. 
</P>
<P>
 "The satisfaction level among visitors is high, but on weekends they don't 
like the dirty, dusty ride on a bus across the (Puddingstone Reservoir) dam or 
the line for tickets once they get to the park," said Andrew Haworth-Booth, 
president of Raging Waters. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't just close the gates after a certain number of people. What would 
you do with those who still want to get in? You could have a riot on your 
hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Raging Waters wants to exercise its option to lease an additional 110 
adjoining acres that would be partially developed as part of the expansion. A 
new entrance, featuring a village of retail shops and a variety of children's 
attractions, would link improved parking areas with the southwest edge of the 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 But before the Board of Supervisors even considers that proposal, the project 
must be incorporated into a revised master plan for Bonelli Park, and an 
environmental impact report must be completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The current Bonelli Park master plan is 23 years old and outdated, county 
parks officials say. A new plan outlining development in the park is being 
drawn up by county-paid consultants who are taking testimony from a citizens 
advisory committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Home to deer, gray fox, jack rabbits and more than 100 species of birds, 
Bonelli Park lies mostly in San Dimas, but spreads into Pomona and La Verne. 
Covina and Glendora, though not contiguous with the park, are also members of 
the five-city joint powers authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The advisory group consists of two members from each city in the authority, as 
well as representatives of conservation groups, Bonelli Park concessionaires 
and other groups with an interest in the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, several members of that master plan advisory committee -- most are 
also coalition members -- formed a fractious subcommittee that released a 
statement saying the workshops to revise the master plan are "a calculated 
effort to manipulate the citizen constituency" into going along with the 
expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 James Park, chief planner for the county's Department of Parks and Recreation, 
denied that the county is considering the Raging Waters expansion only for the 
sake of raking in more revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The department is very interested in seeing Raging Waters survive," Park 
said. "I'm not convinced that, with the situation they are in, that they will 
survive. We need a balanced park that preserves the open space, serves the 
public and generates revenue." 
</P>
<P>
 Park said he sympathizes with citizens who fiercely oppose the expansion and 
are suspicious of the motives of the county Parks Department. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, he said, the department endorsed development plans for Bonelli 
Park that were too intensive by the standards of current Parks Department 
administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, the county proposed adding to the park a hotel, conference center and 
220-unit apartment complex, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in 1990, the county proposed expanding Raging Waters by using 119 acres 
to build new attractions and a parking lot for 4,000 cars, and adding to 
Bonelli Park a 150-room lodge, an 80-unit cabin complex and a 
25,000-square-foot restaurant in a hillside area west of Puddingstone 
Reservoir. Public opposition sank both plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The new master plan revision includes proposals to build horse trails and to 
develop fee-based corporate picnic areas. 
</P>
<P>
 However, coalition members are trying to keep the spotlight and the bulk of 
the controversy centered on Raging Waters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fear I have of this expansion is that it follows a pattern at the park," 
said Jane Riggs, who co-chairs the coalition with Bertone. 
</P>
<P>
 "One-quarter of the park is already developed, and they are never satisfied 
with what they have. Enough is enough."

THE POWER OF BALANCE; QI GONG BLENDS THE SPIRITUAL AND PHYSICAL TO IMPROVE 
HEALTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The professor faces the 30 Claremont Colleges students scattered about the 
wide room. He jumps up and down, arms stiff at his sides, legs straight. The 
students laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Professor Si-Tu Jie then speaks in Chinese, and his interpreter, Sue Sheng, 
quickly translates his words. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we are not balanced, how can we move through life?" she asks. 
</P>
<P>
 Balance is one of the most elementary basics of qi gong, a blend of Taoist and 
Buddhist philosophies, breathing and meditation exercises and medicinal 
practices developed over 2,000 years in China. The discipline, Jie says, has 
influenced Asian art, philosophy, physiology, psychology and culture through 
its emphasis on acquiring knowledge through one's physical and spiritual 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 For two semesters, Jie, a certified qi gong master in China and head of the 
Shao-lin Wei-Tu Qi Gong School, has taught the Pitzer College class "Nature, 
Movement and Meditation in Qi Gong" through the environmental studies 
department. He and the Pitzer College faculty who developed the course believe 
that it is the first and only academic qi gong class at a mainstream college. 
</P>
<P>
 Though many independent practitioners teach qi gong exercises in the San 
Gabriel Valley, the Pitzer course tries to teach students about qi gong's 
influence on Chinese civilization and its application to Western health 
practices, Jie said. 
</P>

 Dr. Angeline Douvas, assistant medical professor at USC, spoke at an October 
conference at Pitzer with Jie. They compared Western and Eastern styles of 
medical treatment -- scientific and holistic. Jie's demonstration of qi gong's 
power had mixed results, Douvas recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 In a demonstration on two volunteers whose movements he tried to control 
without their seeing or touching him, one volunteer mimicked his movements, but 
the other did not. When the professor used qi gong on another volunteer, he 
correctly deduced a shoulder and knee injury but incorrectly diagnosed another 
ailment, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jie and Douvas concluded that patients should rely on Western medical 
technology and use aspects of qi gong -- herbs, teas, meditation and body 
awareness discipline -- as a supplement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the overwhelming feeling (at the conference) is that they (Eastern 
and Western practices) can complement each other," Douvas said. 
</P>
<P>
 She added that with the growing Asian population in Southern California, more 
Western doctors are accepting alternative health practices such as acupuncture. 
"Physicians have to be accepting . . . of patients' orientations and 
philosophical needs . . . and a large number of patients are going to be 
Asians." 
</P>
<P>
 The course's popularity reflects the trend. This fall, the original limit of 
20 was stretched to let 72 enrolled students get in. After the 
beginning-of-term shifts ended, about 30 students were still left, well over 
the typical Pitzer course size of 10 to 15. 
</P>
<P>
 For part of each class session, the students, some of them shoeless, stand in 
rows on the carpeted floor. Eyes closed, they slowly begin to raise their arms 
forward and upward in time to the delicate sound of a flute on tape. They try 
to breathe rhythmically. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the basic eight-minute drill, an integral part of each class. The 
drill is intended to induce a state between sleep and consciousness and relax 
the digestive system -- a state specifically called qi gong.  
</P>
<P>
 "You feel clearer in brain, body and spirit," said Harvey Mudd senior Mark 
Chalice after a class. Students from any of the Claremont Colleges can attend 
the qi gong class. 
</P>
<P>
 The drill is only the beginning of the practice of qi gong, said Jie, a trim 
man in his early 50s who has studied qi gong since childhood. He believes it 
takes at least 10 years of experience to be qualified to teach it. "To be a 
real master, you must devote your whole heart." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Jie, several major schools teach qi gong in China, but hundreds 
of other schools in both China and the United States are not completely true to 
the essence of the practice. "So few really carry the traditional and 
scientific way. So many just collect some exercises." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The theory behind qi gong includes the idea of an energy flow, or chi, which 
is channeled through various points of the body, called meridians. Acupuncture 
specifically pinpoints meridians. 
</P>
<P>
 In the class, which is given every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon for about 
two hours, students watched as Jie drew on the board Chinese characters and 
diagrams of the human body's energy flow. Calligraphy, painting, philosophy, 
even cuisine all share the qi gong concept of achieving balance within one's 
environment, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The course . . . brings a feeling and flavor of a different way of thinking 
of the world to the classroom," said Tom Ilgen, dean of faculty and political 
science professor. "We're not offering this as medical training but as a 
cultural experience." 
</P>

LENDING TO POOR, MINORITIES PAYS OFF FOR THRIFT; FINANCE: AMERICAN SAVINGS IN 
IRVINE, ONCE TARGETED AS A REDLINER, EARNS PRAISE AND PROFIT FOR ITS LOAN 
RECORD TURNAROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A coalition of minority groups had targeted American Savings Bank for several 
years as one of the state's worst "redliners" -- lenders that avoid poorer and 
minority areas -- and wanted to extract a written pledge that the thrift would 
provide more loans in such neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Greenlining Coalition picketed an American branch in downtown 
Oakland in 1989 and finally won a meeting in early 1990 with Mario J. Antoci, 
who had been brought in as chairman a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting went nowhere. Antoci promised that the Irvine thrift would quickly 
do better, but he would not give in to the coalition's demands for a written 
agreement, funding quotas or anything else.  
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'Absolutely not. We're going to do it because it's the right thing to 
do, not because you told us to do it,' " Antoci recalled recently. "I didn't 
want to have the Greenlining Coalition later taking credit for what we were 
going to do just in the normal course of business -- what we felt was good 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition representatives walked out, ending the meeting abruptly. Its members 
continued to badger the thrift and testified against it in congressional 
hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the latest data in, Antoci has delivered on his promise. American 
Savings provided both poorer households and minority borrowers in 1992 with 
more than the Greenlining Coalition could have hoped for. 
</P>
<P>
 American Savings has become the state's premier mortgage lender in low-income 
neighborhoods, devoting a greater percentage of its loan money than any other 
major financial institution to such areas. It also is the second biggest 
provider of home loans to low-income families and one of the top lenders to 
African Americans, Latinos, Asians and other minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, American has shown the industry that there is gold in those 
neighborhoods. Contrary to what some banking regulators believe, American has 
found that such loans are both safe and profitable -- so much so that loans to 
low- and moderate-income households constituted 37% of the $3.8 billion in 
loans that the thrift funded last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have done the biggest about-face we have ever seen," said John C. 
Gamboa, co-chair of the Greenlining Coalition. "It's one of the few times that 
a promise has been more than kept." 
</P>
<P>
 So thorough has the changeover been, Antoci said, that American already meets 
the Clinton Administration's proposal for stiffer requirements in the Community 
Reinvestment Act, the federal law that mandates lending in poor and minority 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 While the coalition fumed about the thrift's poor record, Antoci quietly 
overhauled how the institution looked at low-income borrowers and how the S&L's 
employees sought their business. 
</P>
<P>
 It put branches in East Los Angeles in 1990 and in the Crenshaw District of 
South-Central Los Angeles in 1991, making it the first financial institution in 
nine years to open a branch in that African American community. 
</P>
<P>
 It altered lending criteria to fit the cultures: Latinos were not rejected as 
too risky because they held numerous jobs, and African Americans with no credit 
history were encouraged to show other proof that they were a good credit risk. 
</P>
<P>
 American's new program was never set in stone. It evolved over time as loan 
officers found new ways to help borrowers qualify for mortgages. Procedures 
still change as the savings and loan helps fund such unique concepts as 
nonprofit apartment complexes for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 American's lending record is but one aspect of its effort to reinvest in the 
communities in which its 165 branches operate. 
</P>
<P>
 It has formed partnerships with various companies to develop and help 
revitalize inner cities. It was also among a host of companies providing 
additional money and services in South-Central Los Angeles after the 1992 
riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "The staff is especially user-friendly," said Lori Gay, president of Los 
Angeles Neighborhood Housing Services. "You get the sense that community 
reinvestment is important at every level. It's Mario Antoci's dream of 
(American) being a community reinvestment bank that reaches down to all levels. 
He's concerned about what happens here." 
</P>
<P>
 American's employees serve on community housing panels in South-Central Los 
Angeles and they turn out for such neighborhood spruce-up events as 
"paint-a-thons." They also help in other ways. 
</P>
<P>
 One executive formed an employment program for the YWCA in Santa Ana so the 
organization could begin arranging jobs for residents of its Hotel for Homeless 
Women. 
</P>
<P>
 The thrift has been "most generous," said Mary Douglas, the YWCA's executive 
director. American has provided $100,000 over two years to help the Santa Ana 
YWCA meet its operating costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Federal Home Loan Bank of San Francisco, a federally 
chartered funding source for thrifts and banks that make home loans, praise 
Antoci and American's directors for their leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have that focus at the top, then everybody throughout the 
institution has it," said Gary Curley, an executive at the San Francisco bank. 
"They are aggressive in exploring ways to get the product out. They're making 
it part and parcel of their business line." 
</P>
<P>
 He rates American at the top of the list for reinvesting in the communities it 
serves. 
</P>
<P>
 Minority rights advocate Robert Gnaizda of San Francisco, Greenlining 
Coalition's lawyer, pointed out that American accomplished its changeover in 
just three years, disproving assertions by bankers that such lending programs 
take up to 10 years to show any results. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the coalition in its annual report used American as a yardstick to 
measure how California's biggest banks addressed their communities. The banks 
had abysmal records in lending to poorer households and to minorities, the 
coalition concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Gamboa and Gnaizda now urge federal regulators to hold American up as a model 
for other banks and S&Ls that fall short of fulfilling their low-income lending 
obligations under the Community Reinvestment Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Other financial institutions, particularly thrifts such as Home Savings of 
America and Great Western Bank, do exemplary jobs at meeting their CRA 
obligations. But none has come so far in so short a time. 
</P>
<P>
 Formed at the end of 1988 from the rubble of the failed American Savings & 
Loan -- then the nation's largest and most troubled thrift -- American Savings 
Bank started out the new year without a coordinated effort at low-income 
lending. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it did not even have a community outreach department, something 
Antoci was used to working with during his long tenure as president of Home 
Savings in Irwindale. So, he created one and placed John Nunn, a senior vice 
president for retail banking, in charge. Nunn was well qualified; he is also an 
African American. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to bring focus to this thing and you want to get things done in 
the minority areas, running it with a white person will never get it done," 
Antoci said. "That's reality. You can have the most socially minded person in 
the world, and it won't happen. They just won't be able to open the doors that 
a minority can open." 
</P>
<P>
 Antoci staffed the department with Latinos, African Americans, Asians and 
other minorities. "It just doesn't work any other way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 From the outset, American's directors wanted the outreach department to be the 
best at fulfilling CRA obligations, Nunn said. That meant getting loans to the 
inner city and other poorer neighborhoods, not simply throwing money at 
community organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a really in-depth business plan," Nunn said. "It called for opening 
new branches (in low-income areas), implementing new initiatives, setting up 
partnership programs." 
</P>
<P>
 But the results for 1990, the first year federal law required detailed 
statistics to be kept, were not very impressive. Though American devoted a 
fifth of its loans to low-income neighborhoods, the amount actually loaned to 
low-income families was only 1.1% of its total loans. Worse, when 
moderate-income borrowers were thrown in, the total grew only to 5.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until we were forced to file records, I didn't realize how poorly we were 
doing in the inner cities," Antoci said. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason, Nunn figured out, was that American's loan officers going into 
South-Central Los Angeles, for instance, were based in Hollywood and also 
covered middle-class areas, where they found it was easier to make home loans. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Nunn said, executives learned that when the thrift turned down 
white or Latino applicants, they asked why and what they could do to qualify. 
When the thrift turned down African Americans, they just left. 
</P>
<P>
 The steps American took to correct those and other problems transformed the 
S&L quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Its 1992 results, released four months ago, put it on a pedestal. American 
again poured 20% of its mortgages in low-income areas, but that was four 
percentage points ahead of its closest competitor, Great Western. In addition, 
its loans to low-income families grew to 8.3% of total loans, second only to 
Great Western's 10.5% and well ahead of the 6.7% statewide average for all 
lenders. American's loans to both low- and moderate-income households grew to 
25.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 Antoci said that 1993's results will show that the thrift put more than 10% of 
its home loans in the hands of poorer families and provided an additional 27% 
of its mortgages to moderate-income households. 
</P>
<P>
 Banking consultant David L. Smith of Los Angeles said that American's loans to 
poorer neighborhoods -- not just to poorer families -- are significant because 
much of the housing in those neighborhoods are apartments, and loans to 
landlords help to provide housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the changes that American instituted were not new ideas. Loan 
officers, for instance, often checked to see whether prospective first-time 
mortgage borrowers had been paying rent, utility bills and other recurring 
payments on time. 
</P>
<P>
 It instituted a "second look" to review rejected African American applicants, 
and now is rolling out that review process to other minority groups to become 
more active in helping them to qualify for mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
 What American did was to institutionalize such alternative lending standards, 
giving them a stamp of approval so that all loan officers could use them. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, it found such lending immensely profitable. Poorer households -- 
which devote more of their life savings to housing than more affluent families 
do -- were more motivated to make monthly payments and keep their homes, so 
fewer borrowers were delinquent on their loans. As a consequence, the S&L had 
to set up fewer reserves to cover possible loan losses, lessening the drain on 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, most low-income borrowers can only make a down payment of 10% of 
the sales price instead of the conventional 20%. Such loans are considered 
riskier and justifies an interest rate that is a quarter of a percentage point 
higher. All lenders typically charge higher rates for such loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "So all in all, we're getting a higher yield in general, maintaining lower 
loss reserves and facing fewer foreclosures," Antoci said. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest factor in American's success, he said, was putting branches in the 
inner cities. "You can't do it from the outside looking in," Antoci said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the branches opened, Nunn said, American sent loan officers into 
the neighborhoods talking to religious, business and community leaders, holding 
lending fairs to acquaint would-be borrowers with the loan process and helping 
families plan ahead so that they someday would qualify for mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
 American, with $17.3 billion in assets, will continue to make more mortgage 
loans to inner-city neighborhoods, Antoci said. But he knows the S&L's 
percentages will likely drop as the economy improves and the thrift starts 
making more and larger loans in middle-class and affluent areas. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, though, he is quite pleased with the results -- and results, he notes, 
are all that really matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago, he rescued an old paperweight from a trash pile, and now proudly 
displays it on his desk. The slogan on it admonishes: "Don't Confuse Effort 
with Results." It is pop wisdom that has guided his actions whenever a project 
needs attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with all these things is that if you don't have focus, you just 
end up with a lot of effort, and no results," he said. Eradicating Redlining 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine-based American Savings Bank lending record is cited as a benchmark in 
efforts to stop loan discrimination and redlining, the practice of denying 
loans to those in predominantly low-income or minority neighborhoods. Lending 
in Low-Income Neighborhoods 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20% of home loans originated by American Savings in 1992, the most 
recent year for which information is available, went to low-income areas. 
That's twice the statewide level and higher than many large commercial banks. 
American Savings: 20.2% Great Western: 15.9 Home Savings: 13.4 World Savings: 
12.9 Western Federal: 12.5 Directors Mortgage: 11.0 Bank of America: 9.2 
California Federal: 8.2 American Residential: 6.9 North American Mortgage: 6.8 
Wells Fargo Bank: 5.9 Countrywide Funding: 4.5 Statewide average: 9.5 Lending 
to Low-Income Applicants 
</P>
<P>
 Of the top 10 lenders to low-income applicants in California, American Savings 
ranked second in the percentage of its total loans granted to low-income 
borrowers in 1992. Low-income loans as a percentage of total loan portfolio*: 
Great Western: 10.5% American Savings: 8.3 Bank of America: 6.4 Directors 
Mortgage: 6.3 Home Savings: 5.4 World Savings: 5.2 Western Federal Savings: 4.9 
American Residential Mortgage: 4.8 North American Mortgage: 4.2 Countrywide 
Funding: 1.6 Statewide average: 6.7 *For mortgage classifications, low-income 
households make less $31,228 annually in Los Angeles and less than $41,015 in 
Orange County. Source: KPMG Peat Marwick, Greenlining Coalition, American

DECK STACKED IN VEGAS' FAVOR; CAN CALIFORNIA COMPETE WITH CITY'S NEW FAMILY 
ATTRACTIONS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Dorothy is still off to see the Wizard, but this time the Yellow Brick Road 
passes row upon row of clanking slot machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Munchkins, a gaggle of children surround the pony-tailed actress posing 
as Dorothy inside the new MGM Grand Hotel casino. Grown-ups snap pictures of 
the kids and their newfound Land of Oz friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it's swaggering pirates at Treasure Island or Egyptian princesses at 
the Luxor, similar scenes are being repeated around town as families come to 
see whether Sin City can live up to its much-promoted reincarnation as a family 
vacation destination. 
</P>
<P>
 Most say they like what they find. And that could spell trouble for Southern 
California's $28-billion tourism industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was coming from the Midwest, without knowing the difference, there would 
be no reason to come to Southern California. They will feel they have a 
complete family experience in Las Vegas," said Stuart Zanville, a Studio 
City-based public relations representative and former spokesman for Knott's 
Berry Farm who had just returned from a family trip to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials acknowledge that Las Vegas is siphoning away business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tourists are going to go there. There is no question that is going to affect 
hotel occupancies in Southern California," said John Poimiroo, director of the 
California's Division of Tourism in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 A string of new resorts aimed at the family market have broken the uneasy 
peace that has existed for decades between California and Nevada. The 
Southland, with its film industry aura and five major theme parks, has 
traditionally attracted vacationing families. Adults, not kids, went to Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Las Vegas' allure has expanded far beyond the roulette wheels and keno 
boards. Las Vegas wants everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 Families can visit the Emerald City -- it's right behind the Flying Monkey Bar 
-- at Kirk Krikorian's $1-billion MGM Grand, then head outside to see the 
hotel's new theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 The Egyptian-themed Luxor Hotel offers an entire floor of interactive, 
high-technology adventures and the Circus Circus Hotel opened "Grand Slam 
Canyon," a roller coaster and water ride emporium underneath an air-conditioned 
big top made of glass. Pirates battle the Royal Navy every 90 minutes in a free 
lagoon show outside the Treasure Island resort. 
</P>
<P>
 Fueled by a massive publicity wave, the latest hotel openings resulted in a 
curiosity boom the likes of which Las Vegas has never seen in the holiday 
season. Traffic became so congested on the Strip that a half-mile taxi trip 
from Caesars Palace to the Tropicana Hotel took 35 minutes -- if you could find 
a cab. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Vegas hotels reported filling more than 90% of their rooms, mostly with 
families who came to see whether a city known for mobsters and topless 
showgirls could live up to a freshly minted PG-rated image. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think anything new will capture the hearts of kids," said Lorenzo Williams, 
a vacationing lawyer from Ft. Pierce, Fla., as he entered the MGM Grand theme 
park. "I think it has a lot of potential." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd come here," said Chris Tou, 15, of Los Altos as he sat cross-legged in 
the lobby of the 5,005-room MGM hotel -- the world's largest. "For my age, 
there are more things to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides such word-of-mouth endorsements, Time magazine put Las Vegas on its 
cover last week with an eerie photo of Luxor pyramid and the proclamation, "The 
New All-American City." 
</P>
<P>
 Against such amusement competition, Southern California has relatively little 
new to offer. The economy still stinks and many potential visitors are inclined 
to view the area as gangland instead of Fun Land. 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland plans to opens a new kiddie ride based on its Roger Rabbit 
character later this month, a modest addition to the $100-million Toontown 
attraction it opened last year. The only new theme park on the boards is a 
proposed Legoland in Carlsbad, a landscaped adventure village aimed at small 
children and their parents, that won't open until the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopes are dimming for a project once widely viewed as the salvation of 
California tourism: the $3-billion Disneyland Resort project in Anaheim. Walt 
Disney Co. officials are hinting that their proposed expansion has become too 
expensive at a time when the company is reeling from a half-billion-dollar 
drain on profits last fiscal year from its Euro Disney debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 All the while, Disney is among the amusement operators paying close attention 
to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Judson C. Green, president of Disney's theme park division, said last month 
that the casinos are "throwing a lot of money into the ground" by trying to 
appeal to all ages. Las Vegas, he said, should stick to what it knows best -- 
appealing to gambling grown-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland Executive Vice President Norman Doerges said the Las Vegas 
phenomenon "is a very interesting situation. I know it will be something we're 
focusing on." 
</P>
<P>
 Because locals make up half or more of the visitors to Southland amusement 
parks, tourism chief Poimiroo said he thinks most of Las Vegas' impact will be 
seen in hotels. It is too early to tell how great the impact will be, he said, 
because much of the lost crowds will be Canadians and Northwesterners who fly 
south for the winter that choose Las Vegas this year instead of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotel operators say they can't tell whether the bad economy or competition 
from Las Vegas is to blame for continued sluggish hotel room occupancies. But 
they say it is inevitable that more rooms will go empty while the hordes head 
to Nevada instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime something new opens up, they will try it no matter what you say," 
said Cheryl Phelps, a regional managing director for the Hyatt chain who 
manages eight area hotels from Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest loss of tourists is not those from other states or countries, but 
Californians themselves. With 70% of the state's hotel stays coming from 
Californians making short vacation trips, they may choose Las Vegas over their 
home state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Customers are fickle. They always want to date the newest girl who comes to 
school," said Bill Evans, general manager of the Bahia Hotel on San Diego's 
Mission Bay and chairman of that city's hotel and motel association. "Vegas has 
a mystique. You can shout in the wind but that doesn't mean the wind is going 
to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 The wind may not stop, but most California tourism industry executives expect 
it will slow. Once the fanfare subsides, the new Las Vegas will have to cope 
with a number of problems from its newfound success. 
</P>
<P>
 For one, casino executives have to figure out how to split parents from their 
kids long enough so that the adults can hit the blackjack tables. A parent like 
Zanville, for instance, said he had such a great time in Las Vegas with his 
wife and his two daughters that he never spent more than pocket change on the 
slots during his three-day excursion. 
</P>
<P>
 Other parents, such as Williams, the Florida lawyer, said they had to sneak 
out to gamble. "While my little ones are asleep at night, I'm out on the craps 
tables." 
</P>
<P>
 Wagering subsidizes the town's low room rates, and attracting parents who are 
busy shepherding children day and night only fills discounted rooms that would 
otherwise go to gamblers. 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem is that Las Vegas is not about to give up its Sin City image, 
even if it alienates families. 
</P>
<P>
 Sidewalks are littered with tawdry tabloids for strip-tease shows. Some 
veteran gamblers eye the youthful visitors with contempt, and kids are shooed 
away by casino guards if they venture too close to the gambling pits. 
</P>
<P>
 For those reasons and others, some tourist executives say that they expect Las 
Vegas may be a neon flash in the pan, that tourists will return to vacation in 
Southern California once they see how much -- or how little -- Las Vegas can 
offer families. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the ballyhoo about its family attractions, the Las Vegas versions 
are fairly small. The MGM theme park has seven major rides, compared to two 
dozen or more at a park like Disneyland.

 "I would hope they would see it for what it is," said Reint Rinders, president 
of the San Diego Convention and Visitors Bureau. "To portray it as the new 
Disneyland for kids is a sorry state of affairs." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another theory is that Las Vegas is simply running scared of competition 
from the expansion of riverboat and Native American reservation gambling 
operations, and looking for something new. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gaming is no longer unique. They are adjusting to a condition that hasn't 
confronted them in the past," said Charles Ahlers, president of the Anaheim 
Area Visitor & Convention Bureau. "The family business is of interest to them 
for the first time because it has to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, few in Las Vegas are willing to predict that those problems are 
insurmountable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely going to work," predicted Jeff German, a columnist for the 
Las Vegas Sun and 15-year newspaperman in the city. "I don't think this is a 
fad. It's a matter of reality."

LOW-TECH PROBLEMS WITH HIGH-TECH PATENTS; TECHNOLOGY: INNOVATIONS IN COMPUTER 
SOFTWARE HAVE CREATED A FLOOD OF APPLICATIONS, PRODUCING STRAIN AND CONTROVERSY 
AT THE U.S. PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As its technology grows more pervasive and valuable, the computer industry -- 
which once largely spurned patents -- is racing to the warrens of the U.S. 
Patent and Trademark Office, where workers still rummage through wooden boxes 
to find some documents. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM Corp. -- which once went so far as to publish a list of several thousand 
computer discoveries it had not patented -- has won 368 patents for computer 
digital processing systems in the last three years. That compares to 128 from 
1980 through 1982. Digital Equipment Corp., which received just three U.S. 
patents for computer systems as recently as 1986, got 64 in that category in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rush of high-technology invention has sometimes produced controversial 
results at the 203-year-old patent office, which was established by President 
George Washington in 1790 at the urging of James Madison and Charles Pinckney. 
</P>
<P>
 Patents give inventors legal protection to profit from their ideas. And by 
systematically recording new inventions -- then releasing them to the public 
after the inventors' limited rights have expired -- the patent office has also 
helped foster science and industry. 
</P>
<P>
 But plowing through the astounding growth in patent applications has strained 
the government's bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 As evidence of the burden, critics cite a number of recent computer patent 
controversies, including the office's recent decision to re-examine a broad 
patent on multimedia technology it had just issued to Compton's New Media of 
Carlsbad, in San Diego County. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people feel that the patent office does not have the breadth of 
information available to them to assess these submissions," said Alan D. 
Sugarman, president of Hyperlaw, a computer publisher of federal court 
opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the innovations in the software field are never published in 
journals, as is the case with other fields," Sugarman said. "A computer program 
either works or it doesn't work. You don't need the certification of your peers 
to prove that." 
</P>
<P>
 In its 13 nondescript Arlington, Va., buildings, the patent office is only 
slowly shedding the horse-and-buggy technology it has used for more than two 
centuries to maintain what amounts to the world's biggest filing cabinets. 
</P>
<P>
 Direct electronic filing of patent applications, which the agency has been 
working on for nearly a decade to reduce its mountain of paperwork, is still 
months -- if not years -- away. Even in its paper files, the office has little 
background on computer software inventions, acknowledges the head of the 
agency, Patent Commissioner Bruce A. Lehman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The computer industry does not have a history of publication," he said. On 
the contrary, Lehman noted, inventors have "relied on trade secrecy" to 
maintain their competitive advantage in the computer industry. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Pryor A. Garnett, a patent attorney for IBM, said that while the patent 
office has its work cut out in understanding any new technology, its struggle 
to master computer software has been particularly arduous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every new technology that has come along -- from electricity to chemistry, 
biotechnology and now software -- has created a learning curve in the patent 
office in its early stages," said Garnett, who is also a board member of the 
Ann Arbor, Mich.-based Software Patent Institute. "The issues presented by 
software-related invention have challenged the patent office to improve its 
capabilities." 
</P>
<P>
 The agency has been working with Software Patent Institute, a private, 
university-affiliated educational group, to expand its history of patent 
software invention. It has also been installing dual-screen computers, which 
examiners can use to view patent drawings and text simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 But the office is still saddled with limited computer searching capability and 
a staff that is short of experienced software examiners. Potential candidates 
can earn far more in the private sector than the $28,000 to $60,000 annual 
salary offered by the government. 
</P>
<P>
 The turmoil at the patent office comes as the mass merchandising of personal 
computers has reached a fever pitch amid talk of a worldwide "information 
highway." Computer software innovation -- which has sprung from the garages of 
American nerds as well as such outposts as India and Taiwan -- has produced a 
multibillion-dollar industry that is also helping increase worker productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 But the industry has moved ahead at such breakneck speed that inventors have 
had little time or inclination to document their work. Indeed, the patent 
office used to reject software claims as unpatentable mathematical algorithms 
-- until the U.S. Supreme Court in 1981 declared it legal to patent software. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal protection granted by the court has attracted keen interest from 
companies around the globe. Securing a patent on a widely used technology -- 
such as an essential aspect of a computer program -- is the financial 
equivalent of winning the lottery. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. patent gives the holder 17 years of exclusive rights to sell an 
innovation in the world's largest market. So valuable is the patent right that 
400 applications are contested in court each year, even though legal fees for 
such cases can exceed $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Losers can pay dearly. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, for example, Eastman Kodak Co. paid Polaroid Corp. $925 million 
to settle a 15-year-old legal battle over instant photography patents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most patented inventions are never used commercially," Garnett said. "But for 
those that are, a patent can be immensely valuable -- upward of tens of 
millions of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 The patent office launched its unusual patent re-examination last month after 
the government was besieged by complaints about the multimedia patent it 
granted in August to Compton's New Media Inc., a unit of Chicago-based Tribune 
Co., and Encyclopaedia Britannica Inc. Critics said the office gave the two 
companies near-total credit for a technology said to be already widely used in 
the software business. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision came only a month after privately owned Online Resources & 
Communications in McLean, Va., attracted notice for winning what its president 
called "a very broad patent" that apparently covers any at-home transaction in 
which consumers debit their bank accounts through an automated teller network. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, three years ago, inventor Gilbert Hyatt -- more than a decade after 
microprocessors spawned the personal computer revolution -- won a patent 
covering "a computer on a chip." Although Hyatt's patent was based on a series 
of applications dating back to 1970, the award sparked a firestorm of 
criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Patent expert Paul Heckel is one of many who blames the lack of extensive 
documentation of previous discoveries in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because people didn't patent software, little of the prior art is disclosed 
in patents," and so the background cannot easily be searched, said Heckel, who 
has testified before Congress, written several books on the issue and is 
president of his own small Los Altos, Calif., software company, Hyper Racks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without a good library of prior art to refer to, the patent office has issued 
many patents that will prove to be invalid or of limited scope," Heckel said. 
</P>
<P>
 Patent Commissioner Lehman acknowledges the obstacles his agency faces: "Many 
of our customers are very unhappy with the present system, and we have an 
obligation to do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides re-examining Compton's controversial multimedia patent, Lehman said, 
he has launched hearings to determine how the patent office can best meet the 
challenge of evaluating new technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The self-analysis undoubtedly will underscore the fundamental differences 
between the American patent system and those overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under the U.S. system, a patent is awarded to whoever first conceives of an 
invention. In Japan and Western Europe, a patent is granted to the inventor who 
files at the patent office first. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, pending patent applications are kept secret in the United States, 
while in Japan and Europe, applications are disclosed within 18 months to allow 
others to challenge them. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, a 15-member advisory commission set up by President George Bush 
recommended modifying U.S. patent laws so they would be more in line with those 
of other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations grew out of U.S. negotiations with the World Intellectual 
Property Organization, a global standards-setting body. Patent law reform was 
also a heated topic of debate in the recently completed General Agreement on 
Tariffs and Trade negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, none of the talks have produced substantial changes in U.S. patent 
law. But an aide to Sen. Dennis DeConcini (D-Ariz.) said DeConcini plans to 
reintroduce a measure that would grant patent rights to the first to file. He 
unsuccessfully introduced a similar measure in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Lehman said he will move cautiously to institute reforms, 
contending that the government "must listen to our clients -- inventors -- 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want a system," he said, "that will help foster creativity, not hinder 
it." The Long and Winding Road 
</P>
<P>
 A bright idea may take only moments to conceive; the real work comes in trying 
to secure patent protection. Here, in outline, are the steps involved: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Spend thousands of dollars -- or more -- to develop an idea. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Spend even more to conduct a search of government and scientific files to 
find out if the invention is really unique. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Pay the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office an application fee of $355 ($710 
for companies employing more than 500 people) and submit papers that describe 
the invention and illustrate of the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Wait. It takes an average of 20 months for overworked government 
bureaucrats to review each application. During that time, the Patent Office can 
ask for more documentation. On rare occasions, the agency requires an applicant 
to produce a working model. 
</P>
<P>
 5. The patent is issued, offering 17 years of exclusive rights to the design, 
idea or product. 
</P>
<P>
 6. After issuance, the inventor periodically pays so-called patent maintenance 
fees that total about $7,000 over the life of the patent.

JAMES FLANIGAN: SMART MONEY ENVISIONS PROFIT IN STORE FOR THE '90S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Why is the smart money buying into bankrupt department stores? 
</P>
<P>
 Because major retailers and shrewd investors believe the long recession in 
consumer spending will end this year -- most pointedly in California, where 
other chains are eyeing Macy's and Bullock's stores and financier Sam Zell 
brought Carter Hawley Hale out of bankruptcy over a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are larger meanings. The current bidding for retail properties 
represents a return to sound finance after the delusions of the 1980s that 
landed major chains in bankruptcy. Also the department store business today 
offers an object lesson for all on how money, brains and hard work create 
opportunity where there appears to be none. 
</P>
<P>
 Federated Department Stores, which itself emerged from reorganization under 
Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 1992, last week bought half of the debt of R.H. Macy & 
Co., which filed for Chapter 11 protection from creditors in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Federated, which still owns Bloomingdale's, Rich's, Lazarus and other stores, 
wants a strong voice in the reorganization of Macy's, mainly to get its 
California properties -- Macy's stores in San Francisco and Northern California 
and Bullock's stores in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 There could be a bidding contest. Dillard Department Stores and other chains 
are also eager to acquire a presence in California, the nation's largest retail 
market by far. They see the state coming out of economic doldrums late this 
year, so they'd like to invest now. The smart money acts a little ahead of the 
obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Federated is a relative late-comer. Zell, the Chicago investor who 
has built a $750-million fortune by taking risks on distressed properties, 
bought into Carter Hawley Hale in 1992. The company is California's largest 
department store chain, with more than 70 Broadway, Emporium and Weinstock's 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Zell, a flamboyant 52-year-old who rides motorcycles for relaxation, was 
backed by corporate and public employee pension funds in assuming $200 million 
of Carter Hawley Hale's debt and adding $50 million in fresh investment. For 
that his Zell/Chilmark fund gained 75% ownership of the company, which he has 
now reduced to 52% by selling public stock to raise money for modernizing 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 But Zell's investment -- he has $25 million of his own money in the 
Zell/Chilmark fund -- is no quick-buck exercise. He faces a risky five years of 
hard work, by top merchandisers who have been brought in to Carter Hawley Hale, 
before Zell/Chilmark sees the beginning of apayoff. 
</P>
<P>
 The contrast with the '80s, a decade praised by some as pro business but which 
dealt mainly in trickery, is sharp. Many of the nation's premier retail chains, 
Carter Hawley, Allied Stores, Federated, Macy's and others were involved in 
leveraged buyout deals in which massive borrowings were used to buy up the 
public stock. The theory was that retailers could run just as well on debt 
because customers would always spend and cash would always flow to make 
interest payments. It was an extraordinary delusion. 
</P>
<P>
 When customers stopped spending, the chains fell into bankruptcy. Fortunately, 
valuable franchises did not have to board up their display windows. The 
bankruptcy laws are suited to retail companies, explains Marc Beilinson of 
Pachulski, Stang, Ziehl & Young, a Los Angeles law firm specializing in 
bankruptcy. A firm in Chapter 11 can close stores without having to pay off 
20-year leases in full. It can make a deal with bankers who know that forcing 
liquidation would only get them loan repayments of 25 cents on the dollar, and 
it can make deals with merchandise suppliers who have a stake in the stores 
staying open. 
</P>
<P>
 Now most of the chains have come through reorganization, with lower debts and 
a much greater focus on the need for investment and hard work. 
</P>
<P>
 At Carter Hawley Hale, new Chairman David Dworkin, 49, a merchant with a track 
record of success here and abroad, will spend $300 million over five years to 
remodel stores. Dworkin also is reaching out to California's widely diverse 
population with merchandise and programs geared to Latinos, Asian Americans and 
many other ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 But rebuilding the business is not going to be easy. California's recession -- 
deeper even than Zell foresaw -- has held back Carter Hawley Hale's recovery. 
The company failed to meet lenders' targets for pretax profits and had to sell 
convertible bonds in December. Now it must issue 11.8 million shares to back up 
the bonds, and that could reduce Zell/Chilmark's ownership and potential 
payoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, if Dworkin and his staff succeed, Zell and his investors will reap a 
handsome reward. Thomas Friedberg, an analyst at Genesis Merchant Group -- a 
San Francisco investment bank owned partly by Zell and Chicago's Pritzker 
family -- estimates conservatively that Carter Hawley could be earning $1.25 a 
share by the end of 1997. That could mean an appreciation in Carter Hawley 
stock that would give Zell/Chilmark an 18.8% compounded return on its 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
 That would only be the beginning of the rewards for taking substantial risk 
over an extended period to restore a valuable business franchise. The Carter 
Hawley investment, it should be noted, is being made when the picture in 
retailing is uncertain and the outlook for California -- by most conventional 
analyses -- is bleak. But that's when the smart money invests. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's all the more reason why the enthusiasm of other retailers for 
Macy's stores is so interesting. It reflects a gut feel by business 
professionals that California will come back strong and soon, that Americans 
are ready to spend again in big stores and that today's merchants can offer 
customers value and service. In short, the smart money is saying that the '90s 
truly may be a pro-business decade.

DEALS / ALLAN SLOAN: AMID THE SMILES, UNITED'S PROPOSAL ELICITS ONE FROWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Questioning the proposed deal between United Airlines and its employees is 
almost like spitting on Mom and apple pie. United employees are cutting their 
own pay and making big concessions on work rules in return for a majority stake 
in the airline. It's being touted as the trend-setting deal of the 90s. It's 
been blessed by United's board and leaders of two of the company's three major 
unions, and the Clinton Administration has praised it to the skies. 
</P>
<P>
 But when you look at the actual deal, disclosed in a huge and boring 
Securities and Exchange Commission filing, it looks more like Mom made her pie 
out of rotten apples. You see a deal supposedly worth more than $8 billion 
that, despite the unions' contribution, is being balanced on the backs of 
United's current stockholders and you, the taxpaying public. 
</P>
<P>
 My problem isn't that employees are getting a piece of the action. My problem 
is that they're getting majority ownership before paying for it. And that many 
of the United people who did this deal will be paid richly to leave. Talk about 
your friendly skies. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's start with the terms of the deal itself. It calls for United to give 
holders $743 million of its surplus cash and a total of $1.8 billion of newly 
issued promissory notes and preferred stock. In all, $88 a share. Holders will 
also get one share of New United, which the unions value at $85. The company 
hasn't valued it; I think $85 is too high. But let's use $85, do the math and 
-- tadah! -- current shareholders are getting $5 billion, of which $4.25 
billion is paper. All told, a claimed $173 per share for a stock selling in the 
$140s. 
</P>
<P>
 Okay. Now, Employee Stock Ownership Plans created for the occasion fork over 
around $3.5 billion to $4 billion in return for preferred stock convertible 
into 53% to 63% of New United's stock. In other words, majority ownership. But 
are the ESOPs using money? Don't be silly -- they don't have it. They're using 
promissory notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, watch. United makes contributions to the ESOPs, which give the money back 
to United to pay off their promissory notes. Why this nonsensical shuffling? 
Taxes. United's contributions to the ESOPs are tax-deductible, but the payments 
it gets back from the ESOPs aren't taxable. So United ends up with both the 
cash and a tax deduction. Pretty slick. 
</P>
<P>
 Say there are $4 billion of deductions -- the union projects more than that. 
At today's tax rates, those deductions save United $1.4 billion. Thank you, 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 So there you have it -- $5 billion of supposed value to today's stockholders, 
another $3.5 billion or so from United employees. An $8-billion-plus deal, with 
only $743 million of cash. And no mean, nasty lenders to foreclose if something 
goes wrong. Who says LBOs are dead? 
</P>
<P>
 But I don't think the underlying assumptions fly. The value of the labor 
concessions -- put at 4.5 billion of today's dollars by the company and $6 
billion by the unions -- is highly inflated. It assumes that without a deal, 
United would continue as is for 12 years. But employees would have to give up 
something even without this deal, because otherwise, United won't stay alive 
for anything like 12 years. So the workers are getting credit for some 
concessions they would have to make anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 United's workers get a lot more for bowing to the inevitable than workers at 
other airlines got. TWA and Northwest, for instance, which were at death's door 
and whose stock was worth virtually nothing, gave workers less than a majority 
in return for save-the-day concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, United's employees deserve a piece of the action in return for what 
they're giving up. But a majority stake worth billions of dollars? 
</P>
<P>
 United's explanation, delivered in background discussions: The unions were 
determined to get a majority stake, and United didn't want to risk a 
catastrophic showdown.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I'll bet this cave-in reflects deep pessimism among United's top managers and 
its board about the airline business, in which no one but Southwest Airlines 
ever seems to have ever made any real money or to have any hope of making any. 
This way, United's top honchos will declare victory and hit the silk. What 
happens later won't be their fault. 
</P>
<P>
 Many juicy details haven't been worked out yet. I can't wait to see how United 
handles Chairman Stephen Wolf's stock options, many of which have exercise 
prices well above the $173 a share at which the unions value this deal. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm also eager to see what the directors give themselves; the aborted 1989 
union takeover would have given them 10 years' fees and lifetime free United 
tickets.  
</P>
<P>
 The 1989 deal, whose collapse clobbered the stock market, was financially 
insane. But at least it was fair to stockholders, who would have gotten cash. 
Here, they're expected to take mostly paper, while turning over control. (The 
unions, by the way, dispute that; they claim the managers they hire will run 
New United without having to look over their shoulders.) 
</P>
<P>
 For all the drumbeating, one constituency still hasn't been wooed: United 
stockholders, who have to approve the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm waiting to be convinced," says John Neff of Boston-based Wellington 
Management, United's biggest holder with just under 10% of its stock. Neff, who 
runs the well-known Windsor Fund, said in an interview that the offer "seems to 
be on the light side, considering that it involves selling control of the 
company."  
</P>
<P>
 Maybe when all the details emerge, even skeptics like me will be convinced 
this deal is wonderful. But I doubt it. Apple pie is one thing. But pie in the 
face is quite another.

 Erin and Chris Futterer are 20-somethings who know what they want -- to be 
homeowners. One hitch? The down payment. 
</P>
<P>
 With combined incomes approaching $85,000 a year, the two salespeople hope to 
trade their $1,160-a-month Newport Beach apartment for a $200,000, 
three-bedroom house in South Orange County. That, they figure, will require at 
least $27,000 for a down payment and closing costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the tax write-off, and we want to know our money is going to 
something we own, not to just some Irvine Co.," said Erin Futterer, a 
24-year-old UC Irvine drama graduate. "First, we get the house, then we get the 
kids. I want that white picket fence." 
</P>
<P>
 Their dream of such a well-ordered life would seem certain to be realized, 
given their income, but the young couple faces the roadblocks of meager savings 
and debt. 
</P>
<P>
 With about $3,000 saved and $3,500 in stocks, they have a way to go to get 
that down payment. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for the Futterers, they are not too concerned about being able to 
maintain a high income, though they live mainly on commissions that can vary 
from year to year. They each earn about $7,500 a month, from which they take 
home about $5,700. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, both said, they learned "zero" in college about money 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris is a manufacturers' representative selling office supplies and furniture 
at Byram Tri-West Associates in Commerce. Erin sells forms, marketing materials 
and other printed products throughout Orange County for Versyss Inc., a Boston 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Chou, a certified financial planner in San Juan Capistrano who recently 
met with the couple, said their jobs are among the toughest for good fiscal 
management because their income depends so much on commissions. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Chou said he was confident that the pair could be shopping for a house 
in two years, based on their current cash flow. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they are highly motivated, unlike other couples their age," said 
Chou. "They have a higher income for their age, and an average amount of debt. 
The key for them is to control their debt." 
</P>
<P>
 The Futterers owe about $1,500 on their credit cards and another $3,800 on 
personal loans that they took out to pay for their wedding last Feb. 20. In 
addition, they are making payments on an $8,000 loan for a 1991 Mazda and on a 
$15,000 note on a 1992 Honda Accord. 
</P>
<P>
 After paying the bills and rent, the two usually have about $1,400 in 
discretionary income each month. 
</P>
<P>
 Chou advised the couple to put at least $1,000 of that into a limited-term 
municipal bond fund. That way, they should have enough for a down payment in 
about two years. Erin said she hoped to have the money in about eight months. 
</P>
<P>
 Chou also advised them to eliminate their credit card debt right away and to 
pay off the personal loans as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have good income and good instincts," he said. "Considering the fact 
they just got married, they're actually in pretty good shape. I was impressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Chou said a "definite plus" for the couple is that neither has any outstanding 
student loans. Chris, 26, said his parents paid for his education at UC Santa 
Barbara. Erin's parents paid for most of her schooling at UCI and she recently 
repaid a small loan from her sorority. 
</P>
<P>
 Chou cited other smart fiscal moves. The couple paid cash for their Christmas 
gifts and prepaid a $1,400 skiing trip to Taos, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Chou, the Futterers need to begin thinking about retirement, not 
just housing. He suggested that Chris set up a Keogh plan -- tax-deferred 
pension savings for people who are self-employed -- and that Erin keep on 
contributing to her company's 401(k) pension plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need to set up a balance between how quickly you want to get into a 
house and the advantages of putting away money early for retirement," Chou 
said.

 Autumn and Mike Wilson have successfully dug out of the debt-happy 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 When they met three years ago, they had $24,000 in credit card debt between 
them. Next month, they will pay off the last of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were behind," Autumn said. "Now we're even and moving forward." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilsons take brown-bag lunches to work everyday. They buy clothes on sale, 
wait for movies to come to the video stores and clip coupons for groceries, 
restaurants and almost everything else. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike, 43, teaches high school government and economics in the Anaheim Union 
High School District and works four nights a week teaching English as a second 
language. Autumn, 36, is a meeting planner with California Leisure Consultants 
in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Their goal is to learn how to live differently -- maybe have more fun -- while 
staying within a budget. 
</P>
<P>
 For Mike, especially, such matters weigh heavily. His lawyer father's spending 
left the family destitute when he died, and Mike doesn't want to fall into the 
same trap. Autumn understands, but figures they could loosen up a little even 
as they save for retirement and emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal in life is balance," Mike said. "I don't want to be a miser, saving 
everything for the future. I want to be comfortable saying, 'Autumn, let's go 
to dinner,' and blow $60 knowing we're within our budget." 
</P>
<P>
 Maureen Tsu, a certified financial planner with Professional Financial 
Advisors Inc. in San Juan Capistrano, said the Wilsons have overcome a major 
hurdle to future security: They have changed the spending habits that sunk them 
into debt in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Their strategy now, she said, should be to take the money they formerly used 
to pay credit card bills and budget it for needed home repairs and furnishings. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, she said, they should shift $20,000 -- part of an inheritance from 
Mike's mother -- from stock holdings to savings accounts and other safer, more 
readily available investments. The stock was purchased with money borrowed from 
a brokerage. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's assets total more than $200,000 and include their home, 
tax-sheltered annuities, gold coins and other investments. This year, the 
couple earned $78,000, including interest and gains of $6,000 from the margin 
account. 
</P>
<P>
 Their liabilities are a $148,000 mortgage debt, $1,200 remaining to pay on 
their credit cards and $5,900 in loans and $30,000 they borrowed to pay for 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilsons whittled their credit card debt with the help of a consumer credit 
counselor, paying as much as $900 a month to reduce it. Recently, they applied 
for credit cards with low interest rates of 8% and plan to use them sparingly 
for such special items as airline tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Tsu said too many people who have run up high credit card bills have wiped out 
the debts by declaring personal bankruptcy, only to fall into debt again within 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilsons are "more astute than most," Tsu said, probably because they have 
been through difficult times. 
</P>
<P>
 Their payment of their credit card debt, their high income and their 
willingness to buy mortgage insurance helped them qualify for a home loan last 
July. 
</P>
<P>
 The monthly mortgage payment is $400 more than their rent had been. By June, 
though, the couple will have paid off debts that now consume $500 in monthly 
payments. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tsu counseled them to spend sensibly on furnishings for their home. The 
Wilsons now have little more than a refrigerator, stove and couch. Tsu believes 
that when people feel deprived of a basic need, such as furniture, they are 
tempted to splurge. 
</P>
<P>
 In 18 months to two years, after the home is fully furnished, the Wilsons 
should begin putting $300 to $500 a month into an emergency cash fund until it 
reaches a level with which they feel comfortable, Tsu said. 
</P>
<P>
 She also advised a safer investment portfolio. Currently, the Wilsons have a 
margin account, which involves money borrowed from a brokerage to be invested 
in corporate stocks. Typically, a customer puts a minimum of 30% down and the 
broker lends the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 If the value of the investment dips lower than the purchase price, the broker 
could require the Wilsons to make up the difference. That is known as a margin 
call, and the Wilsons don't have the cash to cover the $30,000 they owe. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very, very risky," Tsu said. "I advise people to build from the 
foundation up: cash reserve, retirement fund and liquid assets," such as mutual 
funds, bonds and stocks that aren't purchased on margin accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 For retirement, the Wilsons are setting aside about $720 each month -- near 
the minimum of 10% of income that Tsu recommends for a couple with at least 20 
more earning years ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 The process of looking squarely at their finances helped clear up some 
differences between the couple, Mike said. Their financial picture, he said, 
was "not as bleak as I thought it was -- nor as good as Autumn thought it was."

 The way Judy Miller figures, she makes exactly $44 more than she spends each 
month. That's if life doesn't interfere -- and life almost always interferes, 
especially when you own rental property. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's rentals need routine repairs; one -- an older four-unit building in 
Laguna Beach -- will soon need a new roof. Meantime, the rents she charges, 
like the values of her properties, have been dropping. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm becoming the best floater in the world, and it really scares me," said 
Miller, describing her survival method: borrowing from one account to pay 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, she borrowed more than $14,000 from her retirement fund to pay 
overdue credit card bills and other obligations. In April, she failed to pay 
her property tax bill -- and she missed the December payment, too. 
</P>
<P>
 And now, she wants more spending money, while at the same time saving for 
early retirement and travel. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's problem is that she's real estate rich but cash poor. She estimates 
that her home and rental properties are worth just over $1 million. But her 
$43,450 annual income -- from her job as an executive secretary, as well as 
rents and interest on investments -- just isn't enough to cover the 
unpredictable costs that come with being a landlord. 
</P>
<P>
 Investment in real estate has put many Southern Californians in Miller's 
position, said Linda A. Barlow, a certified financial planner who runs her own 
business in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nearly 87% of her net worth is in one asset class -- real estate," Barlow 
said. "I like to diversify into five or six areas, so if one or two are going 
down, the other three or four are, hopefully, going up." 
</P>
<P>
 Barlow recommended converting some of Miller's assets into growth stocks. The 
planner said that Miller, 53, then should be able to achieve her dream of 
retiring within five years. 
</P>
<P>
 After her husband died in the mid-1980s, Miller found herself in a position 
that was both tough and frightening -- in control of her own finances. She 
continued the couple's strategy of investing in real estate by buying two 
condominiums in 1990 -- just before the real estate market turned sour. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides her condominium home, Miller rents out a condo and a four-unit 
building in Laguna Beach. She also has put nearly $62,400 in longer-term 
investments: money-market, municipal bonds and retirement funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, she pays $4,266 a month toward mortgages totaling $573,522. In 
addition, her credit card balance is $2,948, and she has borrowed $14,822 from 
her retirement account this year to pay credit card and other bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller wants most to pay her delinquent property taxes totaling almost $9,000, 
including the 10% late payment penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Barlow recommended several strategies: 
</P>
<P>
 * Get the properties reappraised, she said. Their official value may have 
dropped; if so, the property taxes would be lower. 
</P>
<P>
 * Miller could use the $458 she sets aside for income taxes each month to pay 
her property taxes; because her properties show a loss, Miller pays no income 
tax. 
</P>
<P>
 * Miller should make her investments work harder -- sell her rental property, 
for example, and put the proceeds to better use. 
</P>
<P>
 That advice left Miller worrying about paying taxes on any gains from selling 
her rentals. But Barlow assured her there were ways to avoid such taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, she could place the Laguna four-plex in a charitable trust. The 
trust then would sell the property and reinvest the proceeds, keeping control 
over the principal but giving Miller the interest earned on any new 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Laguna apartments were sold for $475,000, for example, there would be 
about $150,000 left after paying off the mortgage. If those proceeds were 
invested at an 8% annual rate of return, Miller could receive about $12,000 a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller also has more than $40,000 tied up in tax-free municipal bonds earning 
about 6% interest. But as long as Miller isn't paying any taxes anyway, Barlow 
said, she should be holding a diversified, taxable portfolio that could bring a 
10% to 12% average annual rate of return over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Barlow recommended that Miller draft a will, a living will to 
describe which life-saving measures Miller would want and a document giving 
power of attorney to a trusted relative or friend should Miller be 
incapacitated. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said she planned to follow many of Barlow's recommendations. However, 
she was wary about diversifying her portfolio. Previously, she said, a broker 
engaged in unnecessary trading in her stock portfolio merely to pump up his 
fees.

PERSONAL FINANCE: MYTHS ABOUT MONEY OFTEN PROVE TO BE COSTLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Have you made any resolutions for the new year? If not, here's a suggestion: 
Vow not to waste money in 1994. It may sound simple, but many people waste 
money through misperceptions about a handful of costly personal finance myths. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a look at those myths -- and the realities. 
</P>
<P>
 Myth: It's a good idea to accept invitations to "pre-approved" credit cards -- 
especially if they have low rates and fees -- because then I'll always have 
credit when I need it. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality: While you certainly should trade in a high-rate card for a low-rate 
card with no annual fee, you shouldn't accept every "pre-approved" credit card 
that comes in the mail. Why? Having too many credit cards can hamper your 
ability to get a mortgage or personal loan, because lenders look at all your 
available credit -- the credit limits -- when they consider your borrowing 
ability. If you have tens of thousands of dollars in available credit -- 
regardless of whether or not you've used the cards -- you may be deemed 
over-extended. 
</P>
<P>
 Myth: I'll need to have $1 million saved for retirement if I want to maintain 
my current lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality: Investment companies and financial planners have been propagating 
this idea for several years, and have won over many consumers. No one knows 
exactly how much will be needed to retire comfortably, however, because the 
number will depend on inflation, your life span, whether you get a company 
pension and whether Social Security still exists when you retire. Your 
non-retirement assets -- such as a home, stocks, bonds and mutual fund 
investments -- are also pivotal. The bottom line: You may need $500,000 or $2.5 
million. The one certainty is that you'll need something , so start saving. 
</P>
<P>
 Myth: Balancing my checkbook is more trouble than it's worth. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality: That may be true if you never bounce a check, but should you bounce 
one check as a result of not balancing your account, the bank generally will 
ding you with a $10 to $15 fee. And most merchants slap on their own charge for 
a returned check, which can range from $5 to $25. So, one bounced check could 
cost you between $15 and $40. 
</P>
<P>
 Myth: Everybody needs life insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality: You need life insurance only if you have dependents or a spouse 
relying on you for financial support. If you are single, or if nobody relies on 
you for financial support, life insurance is a waste of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Myth: If I want to accumulate any real money, I'll need to save substantial 
sums each month. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality: Saving even small amounts pays off over time. If a 20-year-old starts 
saving just $1 a day ($30 a month) and continues to save until retirement at 
age 65, he or she will accumulate more than $314,000, assuming a 10% average 
rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
 Myth: It's difficult to save money on auto or homeowner's insurance premiums 
without reducing my coverage limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality: The easiest way to save on property insurance premiums is to raise 
your deductible. The average State Farm Insurance customer has a $250 
deductible on a homeowners policy and a $100 deductible on auto coverage, said 
Bill Sirola, a spokesman for the Bloomington, Ill.-based insurer. (The 
deductible is the amount you must pay before the insurer starts reimbursing 
you.)  
</P>
<P>
 If you raised the deductible on the homeowners policy to $500, your premium 
would drop about 10%. Raise the deductible to $1,000 and the premium could fall 
as much as 25%, Sirola added. 
</P>
<P>
 Auto insurance policies are less standardized, but raising the deductible from 
$100 to $250 or $500 would generally save between 10% and 40% on comprehensive 
and collision coverage premiums, which make up about half of average cost of 
auto coverage, Sirola said. 
</P>
<P>
 Myth: Paying off my mortgage in 15 years is a great idea, because it will save 
me a fortune in interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality: Short-payoff mortgages are a great idea when mortgage interest rates 
are high and investment returns are low. But when you can earn a higher return 
on your investments than you must pay on borrowings, it makes sense to take a 
long-term note. 
</P>
<P>
 If, for example, you borrow $100 at 7% and turn around and invest that money 
at 10%, you're 3 percentage points ahead. And now, with mortgage rates 
lingering near their lowest levels in decades, it's very possible that 
long-term investors can do just that. Consider locking in a low-rate loan for 
30 years. Then use the extra cash to set up an automatic investment plan with 
an equity mutual fund.

TWO IRVINE INVESTMENT BANKS JOIN TO TAKE ON LARGER DEALS; EXPANSION: THE NEW 
WHOLLY OWNED DIVISION, L.H. FRIEND-DANZI CAPITAL PARTNERS, WILL GAIN FIVE 
ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Two Irvine investment banks are joining forces to participate in larger 
financings, but both say they will continue raising capital for biomedical and 
other small technology companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Danzi, president of Danzi Capital Group, an investment bank formed a 
year ago, is joining L.H. Friend, Weinress & Frankson Inc. and taking his 
five-person staff with him. Danzi will be managing director of a new wholly 
owned division called L.H. Friend-Danzi Capital Partners, company officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The move will boost the number of employees at L.H. Friend, formed in 1984 by 
Larry H. Friend, from 40 to 45 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike is a very talented guy. We hope to further the growth we've already seen 
at our company, and I think he could play a significant role in this, 
especially in expanding our business targeted at high net worth individuals," 
said Friend, 58. 
</P>
<P>
 "He and his people are coming over here, but I'm not buying their company. 
Mike and I are just setting up a wholly owned subsidiary." 
</P>
<P>
 Danzi, 34, a former corporate finance officer at Cruttenden & Co., an Irvine 
brokerage, left there in 1992 to form Danzi Capital and focus on raising cash 
for small companies. Danzi is a Harvard Business School graduate who was an 
investment banker at Drexel Burnham Lambert in Beverly Hills from 1987 to 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "The combination of the two firms will make us a more potent force and better 
enable us to serve our clients," Danzi said. "We didn't have the capital base, 
though we did have the talent," he said, to provide all the financial services 
needed by rapidly growing companies. 
</P>
<P>
 During 1993, Danzi's company raised about $10 million for companies in several 
equity financings and handled a merger valued at $20 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 L.H. Friend participated in several major equity underwritings last year, 
serving as co-managing underwriter for a $30-million deal for Kaiser Resources 
Inc. in Rancho Cucamonga and an $85-million financing for United Gaming Inc. in 
Las Vegas.  
</P>
<P>
 Friend, a former partner with the investment bank Bear, Stearns & Co., helped 
build that company's Los Angeles office from three people in 1970 to about 100 
people in 1978. He has 35 years of experience in the securities industry.

DISABLED ASIANS AREN'T USING PUBLIC SERVICES; SURVEY: 83% OF ADULTS IN THE

 When her son was born underweight, with facial deformities and one shrunken 
hand, Gloria Saito was prepared. 
</P>
<P>
 Saito, a Temple City resident, had pursued a special-education teaching 
credential before her pregnancy and was armed with an above-average knowledge 
of disabilities and public services for disabled individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 She registered her son, now 7, with the state Department of Developmental 
Services, availing him to services provided by the state's system of regional 
centers. The centers help physically and mentally disabled individuals and 
their families with many tasks, from finding free transportation services and 
housing to jobs and counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, parents don't know where to go or what to ask," Saito, 37, said. "I 
was fortunate because I was educated before I had my son." 
</P>
<P>
 A recent study of developmentally disabled Asian adults in Los Angeles County 
confirmed that Saito is a rarity in the Asian American community because she 
sought public assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Conducted by the Little Tokyo Service Center and Asian Rehabilitation 
Services, two nonprofit agencies in the Downtown area, the study found that 83% 
of disabled Asian American adults in the county live at home, sheltered by 
their families, and have not taken advantage of the services available from the 
state regional centers. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons, experts say, are easy to pinpoint: cultural and language barriers 
and ignorance of the services.  
</P>
<P>
 The study, which surveyed about 70 families, also concluded that more group 
homes targeting Asian Americans are needed to provide developmentally disabled 
Asian adults with a transition between life with their families and living on 
their own.

 In a group home, several adults live together under the 24-hour supervision of 
one or two on-site caretakers or house managers. Although there are a few group 
homes catering to Filipinos and Koreans, there are none for Japanese and 
Chinese in Los Angeles County, local experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the study, the Little Tokyo Service Center plans to build a 
group home for eight residents of Japanese and Chinese descent in Monterey 
Park, a city with a large Asian American population. The agency has secured an 
initial $370,000 grant from the federal Department of Housing and Urban 
Development for the project, and is now scouting for a site and an architect to 
design the house especially for the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 With the group home project, "we're going to take care of our own disabled 
people, but we're not going to hide them in our homes anymore," said Alan Woo, 
executive director of Asian Pacific Community Service, a nonprofit agency for 
the disabled. Before taking the reins of the Orange County-based agency in 
August, Woo helped administer the study as executive director of Asian 
Rehabilitation Services, which provides vocational training to the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 The Little Tokyo Service Center also hopes to reserve some apartments in its 
proposed Casa Heiwa low-rent housing project in Little Tokyo as "independent 
living" units for disabled Asian American adults. 
</P>
<P>
 State statistics from regional centers for the developmentally disabled show 
that there were 4,619 clients who listed their ethnicity as Asian last year, 
compared with 106,359 total clients, according to Frances Jacobs, research 
director at the Eastern Los Angeles regional center. 
</P>
<P>
 The low number of Asian clients stems from the fact that many Asian American 
parents aren't aware of the services available or are stymied by language 
barriers, according to Saito and Woo. Cultural habits and traditions are also 
important factors. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong familial bonds, the basis of many Asian cultures, wrap even tighter 
around a disabled family member, experts said. Already fueled by the belief 
that children are a parent's lifelong responsibility, parents become 
extra-protective of their disabled offspring and distrusting of outside help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many Asian families don't want to let their kids go," Saito said. "In Japan, 
the parents' attitude is that the family should take care of children through 
their entire life." 
</P>
<P>
 A certain amount of shame is also involved, with some parents simply 
embarrassed to air in public what they see as an internal family situation, 
said Saito, who heads a support group in Little Tokyo for Japanese parents of 
disabled children. Some parents even pull away from their friends, feeling that 
"normal" people can't relate to their lives, Saito said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents' fears can be legitimate. Saito said she knew of one disabled man who 
moved into an apartment to live on his own. Although very capable of cooking, 
cleaning, balancing his checkbook and handling other basic skills of 
independent living, he had no friends and lacked community support, Saito said. 
Lonely and out of touch with the surrounding community, he returned to live 
with his family, Saito said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is where group homes can help, Saito and others said. Such homes train 
the disabled to live on their own but with the added benefit of a built-in 
circle of support and assistance. But there is a dearth of such facilities 
catering to Asian Americans, which adds to parents' apprehension about letting 
their children leave home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japanese parents want a house where the care-giver can speak in Japanese and 
provide Japanese food," mainly because that is how the child is raised at home, 
Saito said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, language and food were the most common concerns of Asian parents, 
particularly first-generation and monolingual immigrants, questioned in the 
study conducted last spring, said Kirsten Grimm, project manager for the Little 
Tokyo Service Center. The cost of specialized housing was another key concern, 
since many disabled adults live on limited incomes, with some unable to work 
because of their disabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents of disabled adults also are senior citizens on limited incomes 
themselves, Grimm noted, so rents and other services must be affordable. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20 regional centers across the state can assist individuals and families 
in finding low-cost services. Officials at the Eastern Los Angeles regional 
center are also helping with the proposed Monterey Park group home project and 
will remain actively involved with the home to assist residents.

INVITATIONS FOR INSPIRATION; SPEAKERS HELP YOUTHS SEE OPPORTUNITIES BEYOND SHOW 
BUSINESS AND SPORTS

 Anthony Ward dreams of becoming a professional basketball player. But if he 
doesn't get to follow in the footsteps of basketball's greats, the 12-year-old 
wants to be a writer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to give something back. I think I can do that with writing," said 
Anthony, a seventh-grader at Markham Middle School. "Sometimes people say I 
wouldn't make it, but I just ignore them and I say, 'I'll show you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony's ambition and desire have largely been fueled by the success stories 
he has heard from those who have spoken to him and other Watts youths in a 
Nickerson Gardens Community Center program.  
</P>
<P>
 Each month a different guest visits the community center on 112th Street to 
inspire Anthony or any of 80 or so other youths through Keepers of the Dream, a 
speakers program run through the Los Angeles Housing Authority's five community 
service centers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone has a story," said Anthony Ephriam, the center's senior case 
manager. "Some people's stories may reflect the kids' lives and they may be 
able to see the light at the end of the tunnel through someone else's story. 
It's just another form of education." 
</P>
<P>
 Ephriam started Keepers of the Dream in 1990 to expose young people to 
opportunities and careers beyond entertainment and athletics. Opening young 
minds to a wide variety of opportunities is important, especially in Nickerson 
Gardens where most of the children's role models are athletes, rap artists -- 
or the local gang member or drug dealer, Ephriam said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the 8- to 18-year-olds, all of whom live in Nickerson Gardens, are 
referred to the center by their schools or a child welfare agency; others walk 
in off the street to find something to do or someone to talk to. The center is 
often like a second home. The workers are like an extended family, providing 
guidance or a sympathetic ear. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Keepers of the Dream is a critical part of broadening the perspectives 
of the neighborhood youths, Ephriam said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids are like the kids next door only with less money," he said. "They 
have the same potential, the same desire to learn, same eagerness. They just 
need their egos stroked." 
</P>
<P>
 Speakers have included former Mayor Tom Bradley, staff members of the 
multiethnic advertising agency of Muse, Cadero & Chin, reporter Nancy Agosto of 
KMEX-TV Channel 34, Carl Jones and T.J. Walker, owners of the company that 
makes Cross Colours clothing, author George Littlechild and some professional 
athletes. Each has provided a different perspective, a different challenge to 
the youths and encouraged them to think of all of their options in life, 
Ephriam said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has given Antonio Stevens, 16, greater direction in his pursuit to 
become an artist. It has taught Mark Straight, 13, how to set goals, respect 
other people and their cultures and to make the most of his education. And it's 
made Jermaine Jamison, 15, feel that he can be successful, despite some of the 
negativity around him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe deep down in my heart that I can be anything I want to be if I put 
my mind to it," Jermaine said. "I believed that before (the program), but all 
of those people coming to speak here show me that it's really true." 
</P>
<P>
 For each of these boys, who have been coming to the center for several years, 
the most challenging speaker has been author Ishmael Reed, in part because he 
taught them a bit of black history.  
</P>
<P>
 Reed's recent talk on writing, his life and being black in America was Anthony 
Ward's confirmation that writing would play a large role in his future.  
</P>
<P>
 "I really believe that I can do something," Anthony said. "Because like Mr. 
Ishmael Reed said, people told him that he couldn't make it, but I see that he 
did make it. And now I know I can do it too. Because people were telling me the 
same thing and if he made it, I can too." 
</P>
<P>
 Reed, 50, is known for his controversial views on the status of blacks in 
American society. He expounded to the children on everything from brief lessons 
on the contributions of African Americans to American history and culture, to 
twisting negative images of blacks and Latinos into badges of honor: "If they 
hate you and they despise you, you don't let that get you down. You rise above 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Questions and experiences are what drive Keepers of the Dream, Colbert said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives (the kids) a chance to express themselves and show the interviewee 
that he is being listened to by a knowledgeable person," Colbert said. "Our 
kids are not looked at as being knowledgeable -- which is not true. They just 
haven't been given the opportunity. Now they have it."

POLICE STEP UP ARRESTS IN BID TO 'RECLAIM' MACARTHUR PARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAKE DOHERTY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Capt. Nick Salicos, the new commanding officer at the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Rampart Division, is conducting an experiment and his laboratory 
is MacArthur Park, once an urban oasis but tarnished in recent years by crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Since assuming his post in November, Salicos has made safety at the 32-acre 
park a priority, increasing regular patrols to four -- consisting of eight to 
10 officers on foot or bikes spread out over the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've told the officers to stay there, don't leave, live there, even if it's 
slow," Salicos said. "No matter how small the offense is, if it's a legitimate 
arrest, we're going to make it. We're not tolerating any criminality." 
</P>
<P>
 Within the first nine days of the cleanup, officers made 65 arrests. Two 
hundred arrests were made in the first three weeks, Salicos said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two months ago, where there were prostitutes and dope dealers, there are now 
large numbers of families and small children playing in the park," Salicos 
said. "This little experiment is an exercise in what the LAPD can do when it 
has enough officers to reclaim a piece of turf." 
</P>
<P>
 A group of park regulars sitting on a bench on the south side of the park gave 
the cleanup a mixed review. One man said he has seen the same people back in 
the park selling drugs just days after they were arrested. And a woman said 
someone recently tried to sell her drugs while she was watching her 
granddaughter play. 
</P>
<P>
 But others say the park is safer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting better and it's a definite improvement over, say, three years 
ago," said Dorothy Loftus, who has been coming to the park off and on since 
1965. "People don't drink in the park anymore because the police were arresting 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Loftus worried about the homeless people who used to sleep in the 
park. "I feel sorry for them because the police kicked them out," she said. 
"Where are they going to go?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope it doesn't push people back into the alleys east of the park," said 
Tom Coyle, chairman of the Westlake Neighborhood Watch. "Unless we're willing 
to have the police, health department and housing department hound people into 
getting the help they need, they're going to be a headache and burden to 
someone." 
</P>
<P>
 A good park recreation program could reduce area gang activity significantly, 
Coyle said, but the park's layout and the lack of funds preclude large sports 
programs, such as soccer games. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Coyle and others applauded Salicos for focusing on the park, 
which is a key to revitalizing the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cops come by to check up on things so it's much better now than before," 
said John Lopez, one of the regulars on a bench near 7th Street. "People with 
kids are coming back now." 
</P>
<P>
 Another man suggested an additional improvement for the park: "They need some 
latrines here, desperately."

 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority has a dismal record of reaching out 
to the Asian American community and needs to hire more Asian Americans, provide 
multilingual transit information and make the public transit system more 
user-friendly, community leaders say. 
</P>
<P>
 Since October, members of the Asian Pacific Planning Council, a coalition of 
Asian American community groups, have been meeting with transit officials to 
express concerns that the agency is ignoring the needs of Asians, a group that 
accounts for 11% of the county population, said council member James Dichirico, 
coordinator of the Asian Pacific Community Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Transit officials said that in response to the meetings and similar concerns 
expressed by U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena, the agency plans to 
use a federal grant to study "language barrier problems" and how to alleviate 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 The transit agency's lack of multilingual materials and customer service 
personnel who speak Asian languages has intimidated Asian riders and left them 
confused, Dichirico said. Asian bus riders also have complained to Asian 
American community groups of being treated rudely by drivers and customer 
service representatives because they cannot speak English, Dichirico said. 
</P>
<P>
 Community leaders are lobbying for employee sensitivity training as well as 
hiring more Asian Americans. Construction of the Alameda Transportation 
Corridor, light-rail and subway lines, and other projects -- all of which are 
expected to create about 66,000 jobs -- provide a prime opportunity for the 
transit agency to increase its minority hiring, Dichirico said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency "is going to be hiring police officers, customer relations people. 
. . . They've got to be sensitive to the multiculturalism of Los Angeles," 
Dichirico said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another important step is to appoint more Asian Americans to the agency's 
executive and senior management positions, and include Asian community 
representatives in the decision-making process, Dichirico said. 
</P>
<P>
 During their monthly meetings with chief executive officer Franklin White, 
planning council members have provided examples of other companies that have 
reached out to the Asian American community and pointed out the resources, such 
as translation services, that have been provided by local organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping they can see the opportunities in this . . . to improve their 
services," Dichirico said. 
</P>
<P>
 Transit agency spokesman Jim Smart said the meetings have been productive and 
that the agency expects to receive a $300,000 federal grant in the next few 
months to study issues related to language. The grant is the result of concerns 
also raised by Pena, Smart said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency hopes to have its study completed by summer and will then address 
how to "improve our responsiveness," Smart said. "We're very optimistic and 
very enthused."

<P>
 The young gardeners of Esperanza Elementary School have found the essentials 
for cultivating success: an active and conscientious principal, concerned 
teachers and supportive parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a melting pot of what you find in the area, including a lot of newly 
arrived immigrants," said Rowena Lagrosa, principal of the 880-student school 
at 680 Little St. The school opened in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Lagrosa and her staff spend a lot of time providing the kindergartners through 
fifth-graders with some of the social services that government agencies used to 
furnish before budget cuts, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this community we see a lot of single-parent families, a high level of 
unemployment, limited recreational facilities and an environment inundated with 
drugs," Lagrosa said. "Just walking to and from school every day is an 
adventure. They see a lot of violence and abuse along the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the students live in crowded single-room apartments and residential 
hotels. A few have been homeless for a time. "They need an oasis in their 
concrete jungle," Lagrosa said. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, under the guidance of teacher Berta Martinez and volunteer Scott 
Wilson, president of the North East Trees environmental group, the Garden of 
Hope was born in November on a plot at the northwest corner of the school.  
</P>
<P>
 "We mapped it all out and planned the different parts for it," said Sylvia 
Yoc, 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, a retired teacher and landscape architect, helped the students prepare 
their plan and visits weekly to supervise, instruct and encourage them. "The 
idea is to help them create an island of relative serenity," he said. "They're 
a great group. We're teaching them to do things themselves and that's the 
difference between giving someone a fish and teaching them how to catch their 
own fish." 
</P>
<P>
 The 100-by-200-foot garden will have walkways radiating from a fountain in the 
center. Between the walkways are plots for fruits, vegetables, flowers and 
trees. A greenhouse is also in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 One morning last week, Martinez's 31 fourth- and fifth-graders worked on a 
variety of tasks, including digging a trench for the irrigation pipes and 
laying bricks to mark the walkways.  
</P>
<P>
 Wielding picks and shovels nearly as tall as themselves, a crew attacked the 
earth, pausing occasionally to wipe away the sweat or admire their progress. 
Another crew mixed the mortar while others watered the lettuce, flowers, and 
mango and papaya trees that are the garden's first installments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like digging the best," said Edgar Hernandez, 11. After Wilson praised him 
as one of his best helpers, Edgar smiled. "I listen and I do things right," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Edgar and the other students are also quick to thank supporters, such as Ewing 
Irrigation Products, which donated the irrigation equipment, and the Los 
Angeles Alliance for a Drug Free Community, which donated $3,000 for the 
project. Other teachers and adults have also helped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our families like what we're doing and support us even though we do get our 
clothes dirty sometimes," said Melissa Calito, 10. "Ms. Martinez told us that 
if we have more activities like this kids will stay in school. I think she's 
right." JAKE DOHERTY

 Three Korean American organizations and a church pitched in last week to give 
a $1,000 scholarship to an 18-year-old Los Angeles resident who wrote an essay 
about how her image of Koreans changed after a visit to South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaia Niambi Shivers, who is majoring in psychology at Florida A&M University, 
received the award from the Koreatown Assn., the Korean Ministers' Assn. of 
Southern California, the Council of Korean Churches of Southern California and 
Bethel Presbyterian Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Shivers, a 1993 graduate of Washington Preparatory High School, visited South 
Korea in October, 1992, with a group of 10 African American students. Her essay 
revealed a newfound sensitivity to cultural differences as well as an 
appreciation of common values shared by Koreans and African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 The essay was selected as a grand-prize winner in a contest sponsored by The 
Korea Society/Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 "Her essay was a real contribution toward racial harmony and she is the kind 
of student that we'd like to help," said Gene Kim, president of the Koreatown 
Assn. JAKE DOHERTY

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: MID-CITY; HOLDEN'S PAY RAISE GOES TO YOUTH GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The All American Youth Foundation received a $2,500 check last week from City 
Councilman Nate Holden, who donated the money he would have received from a 5% 
pay increase. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the city's 18 elected officials agreed to waive the raise or donate it 
to community groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Holden's donation will help the youth center at 5373 W. Pico Blvd. fund its 
after-school programs and classes, said director Otto Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 The center runs an after-school program for latchkey children called Home 
Alone, in which children are picked up after school and provided with tutors 
who help with homework, Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center also offers a variety of classes, including karate, arts and 
crafts, and beauty and modeling, in addition to a weekly Youth View session 
during which students can talk about issues of concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a good program serving so many kids right in the heart of my 
district," Holden said. "It's helping kids get involved in positive activities 
in the community, but it's just not adequately funded. I wanted to show my 
commitment by . . . making the donation." 
</P>
<P>
 Between 40 and 50 children visit the center each day, Jackson said. "It's 
better that they hang out here rather than on the streets," he said. "It 
doesn't take much for a kid to get into a gang. This can be their home away 
from home." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Jackson is thankful for Holden's donation, the center, run by 
volunteers, needs additional funding to keep going, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We work hard and we're blessed, but we need funding," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, which took a holiday break, will resume its youth programs later 
this month and is planning to begin a free lunch program for senior citizens, 
Jackson said.

 The proposed expansion of the County-USC Medical Center would not increase 
traffic in the area after it is completed in 2002, according to a study 
released late last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The study prepared by Kaku Associates analyzed 14 nearby intersections, 
including two that would be created by the $960-million project. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has proposed consolidating the four hospitals on the site, leaving 
the 1930s-era General Hospital for non-medical purposes. The expansion project 
would demolish 108 homes and apartment units and 12,000 square feet of business 
space to the east of the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The estimated 200 families, as well as the merchants, would be relocated and 
compensated for their losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The study was completed to answer potential questions about the expansion's 
effect on traffic but does not include estimates about the effect of heavy 
equipment during construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The study has delayed the process for another 30 days, project director 
Fernando Vizcarra said. Officials delayed the project to answer residents' 
concerns on the draft environmental impact report, which was presented at 
hearings last summer and fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt that the change (in traffic analysis) was significant enough that we 
had to research for 30 days, and that puts it off for another month," Vizcarra 
said. Until the County Board of Supervisors approves the environmental report, 
including the traffic study, appraisers cannot give residents an estimate on 
their properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the new center would mean a decrease in the number of hospital beds 
from 1,450 to 950, the number of employees and patients would actually 
decrease. The new center would not affect the area's projected annual traffic 
increase of 1%, according to the study. 
</P>
<P>
 The project would move Cummings Street 30 feet east of its current location 
off Zonal Avenue and make it the main hospital's drop-off point. To the south, 
the present Cummings Street would be erased and moved to what is now Chicago 
Street north of Marengo Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The draft circulation study is available for review at the project office, 
Interns and Residents Building, 8th Floor, 2020 Zonal Ave. It is also available 
at local libraries. Comments on the traffic study should be submitted before 
Jan. 28 to Vizcarra at the County-USC Medical Center, Hospital Administration, 
1200 N. State St., Room 1112, Los Angeles 90033.

<P>
 The East Los Angeles Occupational Center has received a donation of a smog 
analyzer from Engineering Science Inc., the company contracted with the state 
to test vehicles for smog emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 The $14,000 smog analyzer will allow students to train on the equipment and 
qualify for jobs at smog-check facilities, said Ben Avila, industrial 
coordinator for the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "To successfully complete an automotive-training degree or a smog certificate, 
students must have hands-on training," Avila said. "This donation will give 
more students greater access to the advanced equipment used by professionals." 
</P>
<P>
 The company also changed the software on the machines to better suit student 
training, Avila said. The new software will allow students to work on the 
machines immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 The analyzer is one of four that the company is donating to various 
organizations. Engineering Science closed four of its smog stations and was 
able to make the donation to the school as well as to the Maxine Waters 
Employment Preparation Center in South-Central, the San Pedro-Wilmington Skill 
Center and the Venice Skill Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Students at the Waters center will also use their analyzer to test vehicles, 
which students in East Los Angeles will eventually do also, Avila said. MARY

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EAST LOS ANGELES; SUMMER ART PROJECT TO RESUME THIS YEAR

<P>
 A successful summer program through Self-Help Graphics that brought art 
programs to teen-agers will likely operate again this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arts Recovery Program, funded with $100,000 from the California Arts 
Council, was put together with only two weeks' notice last June, said Tomas 
Benitez, assistant to the director at Self-Help, 3802 Brooklyn Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Writer and performance artist Ruben Guevara recruited artists to teach the 
eight-week program and went into the neighborhoods to persuade teen-agers to 
participate. About 500 youths took part. 
</P>
<P>
 "A program this broad had never been offered to the kids in the projects, and 
they didn't believe (that it would happen)," Guevara said. "It was a matter of 
getting their confidence. Once the murals started going up, they started 
believing." 
</P>
<P>
 Guevara hired 15 artists and set up classes that met over 18 weeks during the 
summer in poetry, painting, photography and other subjects. The program was 
developed after the 1992 riots and started that summer with youths in 
South-Central. Last summer, it expanded to the Eastside. 
</P>
<P>
 Guevara and Benitez documented the program, videotaping workshops and 
producing a booklet that contained poems and rap songs. Self-Help presented the 
youths' work in October. Paintings were displayed, poets recited their works, 
and rappers performed their songs. Photographs and a documentary produced 
during the program were shown.  
</P>
<P>
 "The opening was great, because the parents came and saw their (children's) 
artwork up on the wall like in a real gallery," Benitez said. The program paid 
off in other ways too, because the youths who participated have come around 
more often for other events at the gallery, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program also helped youths paint six murals in five weeks, in and around 
housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The murals combine elements familiar to the youths, such as graffiti, ancient 
history, Mexican history, and prison and gang themes. The painting at Aliso 
Village on Via Francesca, for example, depicts Christ offering his heart, which 
is on fire. The Christ figure was brushed on, and the rest of the mural was 
spray-painted. 
</P>
<P>
 Guevara hired artists from the projects, such as poet Alma Cervantes, who grew 
up in Maravilla, and painter Juan Munoz from Ramona Gardens. Most of the 
youths, from those 12 and younger to those in their early 20s, had never taken 
classes in mural design or other art forms, Guevara said, but proved to be 
powerful artists when they were shown the basics of expressing themselves.  
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the (program) as a giant composition project, as a huge mural," Guevara 
said. "Having the kids working from the projects to express themselves, their 
views, was like a real-life theatrical performance piece." MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: SOUTH GATE; CLINIC CONSIDERED AT MIDDLE SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY HELEN BERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Unified School District officials are considering a proposal that 
would place a private health clinic on the South Gate Middle School campus to 
serve students and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, a collaborative effort of St. Francis Medical Center in Lynwood 
and Cal State Dominguez Hills, is similar to a project under way in Lynwood and 
is part of the center's Targeting Healthy Communities project, said Gerald 
Kozai, St. Francis' vice president of professional services, who oversees the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 A school-based clinic would give South Gate residents access to affordable, 
preventive health care, Kozai said. Representatives from St. Francis and Cal 
State are conducting a survey of more than 600 families in South Gate to 
determine the health needs of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The campus clinic would be staffed by a full-time nurse practitioner and 
part-time personnel to handle obstetric, pediatric and other medical care. In 
addition to basic family health services, the clinic would offer some 
counseling and social services and provide training and placement for careers 
in health care, Kozai said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very ambitious but a very realistic model we'd like to deliver," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic proposal must be considered by district staff and is expected to go 
before the Los Angeles Unified Board of Education in about two months, said 
Michael Godfrey, coordinator of the district's school-based health clinic 
program. If approved, a clinic could be operational next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The board first approved campus clinics in 1985. However, the clinics on the 
campuses of Jordan, Los Angeles and San Fernando high schools provide health 
care to enrolled students only. Family members are not covered, Godfrey said. 
Each clinic has an annual budget of about $325,000. 
</P>
<P>
 It is possible that the district would donate in-kind services such as space 
and utilities to the proposed South Gate clinic, but how the facility would be 
funded is unclear, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial reaction to the proposal is positive, said school board member 
Vickie Castro, who represents the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime we can bring more services onto the campus and handle social health 
needs is a positive step," Castro said. "Health needs are a priority in any 
highly populated area. The density of that area indicates that (a clinic) is 
needed." MARY HELEN BERG

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: SOUTH GATE; NEW PHONE SYSTEM RINGS IN NEW YEAR 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bells are ringing again at City Hall. The phone fiasco of 1993 is history. 
</P>
<P>
 After a six-week, $70,000 overhaul of the City Hall phone system, Building and 
Safety Director Chon Cervantes will inform council members Tuesday that city 
employees are back in full communication with the outside world. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's 13-year-old telephone system went down Thanksgiving weekend, 
leaving both the public and city workers frustrated. A leak in the basement 
reached the phone cable system and caused a short, leaving much of City Hall 
incommunicado, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Department phones were working within 24 hours. But for weeks, outside 
callers who dialed other departments would hear a mysterious clicking and get 
no answer, while others would be cut off before reaching their party or hear a 
recording informing them that their call did not go through. If a call did slip 
into City Hall, it usually could not be transferred. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, city employees could not make phone calls at all unless they were 
dialing 911. They even resorted to a pre-Alexander Graham Bell system of 
communicating by messenger within the building. Parks and Recreation workers 
were lucky -- they were able to use the pay phone outside their building. 
</P>
<P>
 Building and Safety employees worked around the clock to restore service, 
Cervantes said, and temporarily jury-rigged modem lines to be used for 
telephone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 7, the council scheduled a special meeting to approve spending capital 
improvement funds from the Public Works Department budget for the new system. 
</P>
<P>
 Telephone problems have not been unusual at City Hall, Cervantes said. The 
system frequently broke down, leaving the city switchboard eerily silent for 
hours. Plans for the new system were made in September, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The new system includes rented phone lines from Pacific Bell, voice-mail 
installation and eventual replacement of every phone at City Hall, Cervantes 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the new system, city phone numbers have changed. The new main 
number for City Hall is (213) 563-9500; the Police Department can be reached at 
(213) 563-5400. MARY HELEN BERG

 Some might call them modern-day Johnny Appleseeds, but they prefer to think of 
themselves as businessmen learning to plant trees in a concrete desert. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an opportunity to start a small business," said Kirk James, one of 
five men from the Union Rescue Mission taking part in a tree-planting course. 
"Any doors that are open because of this will be part of my recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 James, 32, will begin landscaping classes next month in Watts as part of an 
initiative organized by Tree People, CB Commercial Realty and the Union Rescue 
Mission. Organizers want to provide training to recovering drug addicts while 
helping beautify the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The participants will take part in a five-week forestry program beginning this 
month, where they learn everything from the city's tree-planting requirements 
to how to protect the roots of plants. 
</P>
<P>
 The seed for the project was planted when Steve Demming, an executive at CB 
Commercial, approached a group of real estate agents to discuss what might be 
done to help rebuild areas that had been hit hard in the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "We contacted the Rebuild LA people, Peter Ueberroth's group, and they weren't 
ready to direct us in any constructive fashion, so they suggested we do our own 
thing," Demming said. "So a group of us, about 20, got together and tried to 
come up with ideas about how we could contribute to the community, and one of 
the ideas was this." 
</P>
<P>
 Within a year, the real estate agents had raised $15,000 in contributions, and 
they contacted Tree People, a Los Angeles-based environmental group dedicated 
to promoting tree planting, and Union Rescue Mission in Downtown. The money 
will be used to train crews and pay participants $6.50 an hour while they learn 
to create a greenbelt in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants were selected based on their performance in the mission's 
recovery program as well as their interest in landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 For Morgan Selva, the program will give him another chance to pursue a 
landscaping business he lost in the late 1980s. He then found himself homeless. 
"If I decide to go back to it, I can have a better business because I'll have 
learned the right way to do things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a reason we're in South-Central and Watts, and that's because we 
decided South-Central is generally underserved," said Hilma Cohn, director of 
Tree People's forestry program. "It is an area that desperately could use some 
trees." 
</P>
<P>
 For Demming, the program has the potential to provide jobs by creating 
minority-owned companies that provide tree maintenance to companies in Los 
Angeles. "There is still about $20 million being spent by companies on 
landscaping, (little) of which goes to minority-owned companies," Demming said.

 The Los Angeles city attorney's office has filed two lawsuits against the 
owners of South-Central motels, one citing criminal slum charges and the other 
citing prostitution-related complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gates Motel at 7814 S. Figueroa St. was cited last month. The lawsuit 
alleges that police had been called more than 20 times since January, 1992, to 
investigate prostitution complaints. Several prostitutes interviewed by police 
reportedly said they rented rooms at the 12-unit Gates Motel for $7 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Charges were filed under a red-light abatement lawsuit against Dilipkumar 
Patel, Hemlata Patel, Paramjit Kullar and Bimbo Kaur, the owners of the Gates 
Motel, according to Ed Fimbres, the deputy city attorney in charge of the case. 
Efforts to reach the owners were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 Fimbres said the owners have contacted the city attorney and "have been 
agreeable to a stipulated injunction," which would set operating restrictions 
at the motel and require improved lighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Also last month, the city attorney filed a lawsuit against the owners of the 
Brownstone Hotel at 425-427 East 5th St., alleging criminal slum conditions. 
The suit stems from investigations by the Slum Housing Task Force that 
reportedly found rodent and cockroach infestations, security bars without 
quick-release devices, and cracked and peeling paint at the 59-unit hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're looking at something that is basically a trap," said Lawrence P. V. 
Punter, the deputy city attorney handling the case. "When you have bars without 
quick-release devices . . . people can't get out." 
</P>
<P>
 Named in the criminal complaint are owners Sumruey Aueyong and Sukumarn Sue 
Aueyong of Arcadia, according to the city attorney. A notice of probation 
violation also has been filed against Sumruey Aueyong, who was convicted of 
similar slum violations at the hotel in 1992, according to the city attorney's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Sumruey Aueyong said he was unaware of the probation violation and said 
problems at the hotel were being corrected. "We have taken care of it," he 
said. "Time is so short to take care of all of it, but we are taking care of 
it. We already called the fire inspector." E.J. GONG JR. and SANDRA HERNANDEZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH; NO INJUNCTION IN ADULT CARE HOME CASE

<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge has refused to issue a preliminary injunction against a woman accused 
of operating an adult care facility without a license, citing lack of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Diane Wayne turned down the state attorney general's 
request that would bar Gevenva Church from operating a licensed care facility. 
Wayne told Deputy Atty. Gen. Tammy Chung "you've given me no proof" that the 
residents of Ephesians Haven at 1925 Hobart St. require supervised care or that 
Church continues to operate the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I have is a situation where elderly people clearly don't want to move," 
the judge added. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's hearing marked the first time that Church, who operated the Sharon 
Lynn Guest Home at 12040 S. Broadway, was in court to face allegations that she 
continues to run an adult care center without a license. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in a gray suit, Church sat quietly in the back of the courtroom with 
her husband while the judge denied the motion. Church's attorney, David J. 
Morris, refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Church's license to operate an adult care facility was revoked in October by 
the state Department of Social Services after she was cited for repeated health 
and safety violations at the Sharon Lynn Guest Home.  
</P>
<P>
 "We hardly ever seek injunctions," said Arthur Carter of the Department of 
Social Services Licensing Care office. "People will usually comply, and this is 
the first time I've had to do one in the last five years." 
</P>
<P>
 The state attorney general's office has said that Church has been operating 
the Ephesians Haven since losing her license. The Department of Social Services 
contends that up to nine residents who lived at the Sharon Lynn Guest Home live 
at the Hobart Street facility and require supervised care. 
</P>
<P>
 Several times during the hearing, Chung urged Wayne to reconsider, saying the 
fact that residents of the Ephesians Haven had spent time living in a licensed 
care facility demonstrates that they require professional care. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Wayne disagreed, saying no medical testimony was presented to show 
that many of the mostly elderly residents were incompetent or unable to take 
their own medication. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (residents) clearly don't want to move," Wayne said. "What do I do? Move 
these 89-year-old people based on a social worker's one- or two-day report? I 
just can't move them."  
</P>
<P>
 Chung said she may seek medical testimony that would prove most of the 
residents require supervised care. 
</P>
<P>
 Church also faces action on outstanding fines that have accumulated since her 
license was revoked last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll try to collect that money, but we still have to prove that she has been 
operating a home without a license," Chung said. SANDRA HERNANDEZ

 The Asian Pacific American Legal Center may have to lay off six of its eight 
full-time staff members and turn away some poor clients if its funding for free 
legal services is severely reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 The center at 1010 S. Flower St., the largest legal center in the nation for 
Asian and Pacific Americans, is one of 125 legal services statewide that 
receive funding from a lawyers' trust fund account for poverty law services. 
</P>
<P>
 The interest from the trust fund has been a major source of money for legal 
services for the poor since 1981; during the 1992-93 fiscal year, it provided 
$22.7 million to legal agencies statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of the recession and lower interest rates, the funds have been 
reduced by almost $8 million in the current fiscal year and face an even larger 
cut in fiscal 1994, according to officials at the State Bar, which administers 
the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Assemblyman Ray Haynes (R-Temecula) has proposed legislation to 
divert the trust fund money from legal services to help crime victims and keep 
county probation camps open. His bill is still in committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of Haynes' proposal argue that, although crime victims and probation 
camps are worthwhile causes, legislators should not reduce free legal services, 
which help abused children, defrauded senior citizens and other victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The Asian Pacific American Legal Center, which has received $150,000 to 
$250,000 annually from the trust fund over the past five years, may lose as 
much as 75% in fiscal 1994. The center, which serves clients in five Asian 
languages and in Spanish, already had to deal with a 33% reduction this fiscal 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Since slashing the trust fund will also affect larger organizations, such as 
the Legal Aid Foundation of Los Angeles, the center stands to see a further 
drop in funds because it often receives money from such organizations for 
various programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're particularly hurt because we get very little government funding . . . 
less than 10% of our funding is government-based," said Stewart Kwoh, the 
center's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 What is ironic, Kwoh said, is that while the recession is forcing cuts in the 
fund, the economic downturn also increases the number of people in need of free 
legal services. Kwoh's center, which just celebrated its 10th anniversary, has 
seen a steady increase in clients over the past decade and last year served 
14,000 people. 
</P>
<P>
 In the worst-case scenario, the center may have to lay off most of its 
full-time staff and depend on part-time and volunteer attorneys, which could 
drastically limit its service to poor clients, Kwoh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Center staff said they expect to find out in the spring how much they will 
receive in fiscal 1994. IRIS YOKOI

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; WARRANT SOUGHT IN FAKE GARMENT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 An arrest warrant is expected to be issued for the owner of a garment factory 
who did not show up in court last week to respond to charges of manufacturing 
illegal knockoffs of the Karl Kani and Cross Colours denim clothing lines. 
</P>
<P>
 After Song Suk Park failed to show Monday for her arraignment in Los Angeles 
Municipal Court, Deputy City Atty. Fay Chu asked a judge to issue an arrest 
warrant for Park, 51, owner of Victory Fashions at 425 W. 11th St. 
</P>
<P>
 Park and Victory Fashions manager Manuel Enrique Sagastume, 36, are charged 
with one count each of counterfeiting a trademark. 
</P>
<P>
 Sagastume entered a not guilty plea Monday and was ordered to return to court 
Jan. 31 for pretrial proceedings. He will be represented by a public defender. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted of the misdemeanor charge, each would face a maximum sentence of 
up to one year in jail and a $5,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Sagastume is a resident of the Wilshire district; Park, who is also known as 
Son Suk Knepley, Song Suk Yoon and Song Suk Kim, has homes in Cerritos and 
central Los Angeles, city prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 The case against Victory Fashions was built after an employee of Threads 4 
Life, the Los Angeles company that owns the Karl Kani and Cross Colours 
trademarks, stumbled onto the alleged counterfeit operation during a visit to 
another business in the same 11th Street building, city prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Threads 4 Life officials complained to the state Department of Justice's 
Bureau of Investigation, which searched Victory Fashions on June 16 and found 
1,508 counterfeit Karl Kani pants and a number of Karl Kani and Cross Colours 
rivets, labels, buttons and zippers, according to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 The clothing, worth $227,000, was in boxes and ready for shipment to Chicago, 
said Darryl Phillips, special agent for the Department of Justice's trademark 
infringement unit in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The baggy Karl Kani pants, which sell for about $80, and the multicolored 
Cross Colours street-style clothing, which average about $55 per item, are 
particularly popular among youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Victory Fashions is one of more than a dozen Los Angeles manufacturers being 
criminally prosecuted or sued in civil court by Threads 4 Life. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl Jones, president and CEO of Threads 4 Life, said illegal knockoffs 
account for losses in the millions of dollars for his company and its vendors.

COVER STORY; THEY ALL HIT THE JACKPOT; ONE MIGHT EXPECT A MULTIMILLION-DOLLAR 
LOTTERY WINNER TO SETTLE INTO A LIFE OF LUXURY. BUT ANDY VARGAS CHOSE TO SHARE 
HIS FORTUNE WITH OTHERS INSTEAD 
</P>

<P>
 Before teeing off at the California Country Club in Industry, Andy Vargas took 
a brief detour and completed a ritual that has made him famous on the fairways. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding a crumpled plastic shopping bag, the 67-year-old business man reached 
into a trash bin and began to scoop out empty soda and beer cans, as nearby 
golfers watched in wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh boy, look how many there are," Vargas said, sounding like a youngster who 
just stumbled upon a jar of treats. "We hit the jackpot, boys and girls." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not the first time Vargas had walked away with a jackpot. On Feb. 6, 
1988, after buying $15 worth of lottery tickets from a neighborhood store, 
Vargas won the $5.28-million grand prize in California's Super Lotto game. 
</P>
<P>
 A multimillion-dollar lottery winner might be expected to immediately retire 
into a life of luxury, but Vargas decided to share his fortune with others. 
Since hitting the jackpot, the Monterey Park resident has helped hundreds of 
people in Lincoln Heights and other Eastside communities, both directly and 
through a variety of charitable deeds -- one of which he started funding 
through the laborious process of recycling cans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Andy's famous. He's the man with the heart of gold," said James Allen, 
principal of Glen Alta Elementary School. "You don't see too many people like 
him anymore who truly want to help people and don't expect anything in return." 
</P>
<P>
 Even before becoming a millionaire, Vargas, who owned a small garment 
manufacturing business in Lincoln Heights for 25 years, did more than his share 
to help the community. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, after refusing to accept money for uniforms he made for the Glen Alta 
drill team, Vargas was asked if he would be willing to "adopt" the school 
through the Los Angeles Unified School District's Adopt-a-School program. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas, unaware that the program recruits businesses and individuals to assist 
schools, paused for a moment and then asked, "How many children do you need me 
to take home?" 
</P>
<P>
 "(The principal) said: '400,' and I thought: 'Oh my God,' " Vargas said. "But 
then she told me (details) about the program and I said OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas' first goal was to establish a college scholarship fund for Glen Alta 
graduates, in part because he dropped out of school after the eighth grade and 
always felt hindered by his limited education. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the only thing I would change in my life," said Vargas, who is married 
and has four grown children. "I would get as much education as I could, because 
you can never catch up." 
</P>
<P>
 To fund his scholarship foundation, Vargas started collecting aluminum cans. 
Although he collected 900 pounds in 18 months, his efforts earned him only 
$675. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in 1988, immediately after winning the lottery, Vargas contributed 
$20,000 of his first annual post-taxes check of $190,000 to his scholarship 
fund. He raised $70,000 for the fund, mostly proceeds from an annual 
fund-raising golf tournament he began in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, for the first time, Vargas awarded scholarships, ranging from $500 
to $1,000, to 15 high school seniors. Students who attended at least the fifth 
and sixth grades at Glen Alta Elementary and plan to continue their education 
after high school are eligible to receive a scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Andy's vision is to help any kid interested in going to college or a 
vocational program, regardless of their grades," Allen said. "When the first 
recipients of his scholarship were announced at the last tournament, Andy was 
just beaming. That's what he worked so hard for." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to creating the scholarship fund, Vargas was instrumental in 
getting Richard Riordan, who at the time was a lawyer and businessman, to 
donate $80,000 in computers and computer equipment to the school in 1991. 
Riordan, who was elected mayor last April, made similar donations to schools 
throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas also regularly visits Glen Alta Elementary, which he adopted because of 
its proximity to his garment manufacturing businesses, and takes 40 students to 
McDonald's for lunch every year on Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from his involvement at the school, Vargas is president of the Lincoln 
Heights Optimist Club and is a board member of the Lincoln Heights Chamber of 
Commerce. He also organized a new Optimist Club in El Sereno and is one of the 
key fund-raisers for White Memorial Medical Center in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides time and labor, his charity takes the form of cold cash; Vargas 
estimates that he donates $70,000 a year to charities or charitable events. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's like Santa Claus," Allen said. "All he needs is a big white beard and to 
gain about 100 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Vargas -- a lanky man with slicked-back dark hair -- hardly resembles 
the man in the red suit, he sometimes can't help but play the role. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleven days before Christmas, Vargas spent the morning in Downtown Los Angeles 
buying toys for dozens of children who would be coming to the Lincoln Heights 
Optimist Club party the following day. 
</P>
<P>
 "No guns, no guns," Vargas said as he browsed through the aisles of a store 
and finally reached for a Dream Girl doll. "Now, this is real nice. I'll take a 
half dozen." 
</P>
<P>
 By lunchtime, Vargas and fellow Optimist member Blackie Mata had picked out 
more than 50 dolls, games, race cars and other toys from various shops near 
Third and Wall streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Andy's a very good person," said Mata, who has known Vargas for 30 years and 
carries a photograph of one of his six grandchildren in her wallet. "Everybody 
in the community knows him and likes him." 
</P>
<P>
 The next day at the Christmas party, Vargas played host to 100 elementary 
school children crowded into the Los Angeles Boys' and Girls' Club in Lincoln 
Heights. While a magician and clown entertained the children, Vargas worked 
behind the scenes, passing out McDonald's hamburgers and 10-pound frozen 
turkeys to every child. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you think of someone who won the lottery, (do) you think that person would 
be doing this?" said George Mauney, a longtime friend of Vargas. "Helping 
children is his life." 
</P>
<P>
 Three days before Christmas, Vargas stood outside the Bank of America in 
Lincoln Heights, handing out fruit and toys to children on the street. Every 
year, the Lincoln Heights Chamber of Commerce and local merchants sponsor a 
three-day gift-giving event. Vargas' responsibilities included going 
door-to-door to collect money from the merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boy, that wasn't easy," Vargas said as he watched hundreds of children line 
up for their free stocking along North Broadway. "Sometimes, you have to go 
back four or five times to the same store." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the hard work, Vargas seems happiest when he is in the midst of a 
charity event. He never complains of fatigue, although he spends most mornings 
and afternoons working on some philanthropic project. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never slows down," said Stella George, a fellow philanthropist and friend. 
"He makes plans like he's going to help children forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Vargas tried to help others long before he won the lottery, he did 
not have the influence or the financial means to make a difference, his friends 
say. Since winning, however, he has learned how to use his fame and instant 
wealth to become a more effective leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Petrified of speaking in front of crowds, Vargas enrolled in a Toastmasters 
speaking club and is "dangerous now when you give him the mike," said Richard 
Enriquez, former president of the Lincoln Heights Optimist Club and lieutenant 
governor of the southeast region of Optimist International. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas, who almost exclusively wore old slacks and golf shirts in the past, 
now wears suits when he attends formal functions and business meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's more polished and experienced than he used to be," Enriquez said. "But 
his personality hasn't really changed. Winning the lottery simply has allowed 
him to take his charitable gestures to a higher level." 
</P>
<P>
 More often than not, Vargas is described as an "average Joe," which sometimes 
hinders him when he takes on leadership roles. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's still learning," Enriquez said. "When he's in charge of the Optimist 
Club meetings, he sometimes jumps around from item to item on the agenda. It's 
more fun now, but less business. He has to learn how to be more of a 
bureaucrat." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Colorado, Vargas moved to California when he was 16, first to San 
Francisco and then to the Los Angeles area. After serving 19 months in the 
Navy, he worked as a dishwasher, a grass cutter and a welder at Pacific Pump, 
now known as Ingersoll-Dresser Pump Company in Huntington Park. 
</P>
<P>
 With $300 in the bank, he then began selling clothes out of his home, and in 
1963 opened a small business in Lincoln Heights that manufactured girls' 
uniforms. After winning the lottery, Vargas gave the business to one of his 
sons. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas, who struggled to send his youngest son to UC Berkeley, said he wants 
to help others pay for college because he knows how hard it is to succeed 
without an advanced degree. Although Vargas' wife and children support him in 
his philanthropic efforts, they say they prefer to keep their privacy and stay 
out of news stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I was at Pacific Pump, I was president of the union and wanted a job in 
management," Vargas said. "But because of my lack of education, I couldn't do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his wealth, Vargas has retained a simple lifestyle. He still lives in 
the same modest three-bedroom home he and his family moved into 33 years ago. 
And he kept his Ford Escort station wagon for more than two years after winning 
the lottery, eventually trading it in for a gold Acura Legend. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing that's different is that now I can help more people," Vargas 
said. "Someone once said to me: 'You're a nut. You could be having a good time 
now.' And I said: 'I am having a good time.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Because Vargas rarely broadcasts the fact that he is a lottery winner, many of 
his friends didn't find out about his good fortune until years later. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know he was a millionaire until someone told me about two to three 
years later," said Jesus Rodriguez, a fellow Optimist Club member who has known 
Vargas for seven years. "He was giving to all these charities, and I asked 
someone: 'What's up with Andy? Is he a millionaire or something?' That's when I 
found out." 
</P>
<P>
 Other people still have trouble believing Vargas is a millionaire, especially 
when they see him digging through the trash for aluminum cans. 
</P>
<P>
 "One guy I know saw me on the street picking up cans, and he told this other 
guy: 'No way. That can't be the same guy who won the lottery. I saw him picking 
up cans,' " Vargas said, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Vargas still collects cans because "it's a habit that's hard to 
stop," his biggest fund-raising effort is his annual golf tournament at the 
Montebello Municipal Golf Course. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, the first year of the tournament, 68 players competed. Last year, 137 
golfers paid the $100 registration fee to take part in the charity event. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest supporter of Vargas' golf tournament is Riordan, who has sent 
players from his law firm to the tournament since its inception. 
</P>
<P>
 Vargas met Riordan in 1988 at a banquet where they both were honored for their 
support of Los Angeles schools. Vargas later called Riordan at his law practice 
to invite him to play in his golf tournament, not knowing who he was or what he 
did. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was a schoolteacher or something," Vargas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moved by Vargas' down-to-earth personality, Riordan agreed and sent 13 players 
to the first Andy Vargas golf tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's an incredible role model," Riordan said. "I mean, here's a man 
who won the lottery and is giving it to education. His sincerity and generosity 
is almost to a point of compulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt very moved by what he was doing and wanted to help." 
</P>
<P>
 Loyalty works both ways, and during last year's mayoral campaign, Vargas 
proved to be one of Riordan's biggest supporters. He spoke at several campaign 
fund-raisers in Riordan's behalf, including one at the Biltmore Hotel in front 
of 500 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Vargas said he enjoyed being thrust into the middle of the campaign, 
his goal isn't to gain more publicity. Rather, his dream is to expand his 
foundation so that Glen Alta graduates can receive scholarships throughout 
their college career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I had a zillion dollars to help people with," Vargas said. "That would 
make me happy." On the Cover: 
</P>
<P>
 Lotto winner Andy Vargas, 67, and others handed out toys to children during 
the Christmas season in front of a Bank of America branch in East Los Angeles. 
Rather than retire to a life of luxury, Vargas, who won a $5.28-million Lotto 
jackpot in 1988, has spread much of his wealth throughout the Eastside, 
particularly to youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 "His heart has always been with the children," said Jesus Rodriguez, a member 
of the Lincoln Heights Optimist Club. "His feeling is that they are the future 
and we should do whatever we can to help them."

OTHER COACHES QUESTION ROOSEVELT STUDENT TRANSFERS 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
 Members of the Roosevelt High girls' basketball team characterize Lorenzo 
Garcia as dedicated and caring, a coach who goes out of his way to help in time 
of need. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and school administrators praise the sixth-year coach as hard-working, 
citing his fund-raising efforts to purchase uniforms and warm-ups and put on 
awards banquets. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also successful on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia, just one win away from his 100th coaching victory, has guided the 
Roughriders to two City Section basketball titles and four conference 
championships. This season, Roosevelt is off to a 9-1 start. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is committed to showing you can have a good program at an East L.A. 
school," Roosevelt Principal Henry Ronquillo said. "Lorenzo goes out of his way 
to put in that extra mile for his team." How far is open for debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposing coaches allege that Garcia abuses his power as Roosevelt's dean of 
students to bring transfers into his program. This season, Roosevelt has three 
opportunity transfer players on its roster, including two starters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's blatant and obvious what he does, but it's done in a way that no rule 
prevents it," Marshall Coach Wendy Triplett said. Triplett, along with Coleen 
Ota of Garfield, Cathi Cornell of Eagle Rock, Mat Taylor of Fremont and Sharon 
Robertson of South Gate, are among the coaches who have had a falling out with 
Garcia. Perhaps the most serious allegation has been made by former Washington 
Coach Phil Chase, now a teacher at Marshall. In a letter to the City Section 
office last month, Chase charged Garcia with "chicanery" and questioned the 
validity of the transfer of starting guard Jennifer Brambila. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase, who coached Brambila on an Amateur Athletic Union team last spring, 
said Brambila told him she intended to transfer to Roosevelt without changing 
residences "and that it had all been taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said he has no contact with transfers until they are cleared by 
Athletic Director Bernard Terry and dismisses the allegations as "ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody wants to take a shot at a winner," Garcia said. "If they want to 
attack me, that's fine. Everything is legal and I've done nothing wrong. What 
upsets me is forcing my players to deal with rumors and to go through this with 
a dark cloud over their heads." 
</P>
<P>
 Chase's letter has also triggered a investigation by City Commissioner Barbara 
Fiege. Fiege declared Brambila ineligible Friday morning but suspended that 
ruling shortly before the Roughriders' game that afternoon against Bell after 
Roosevelt administrators cited a conflict between City and CIF rules regarding 
transfers. 
</P>
<P>
 The CIF prohibits transfers from participating in varsity competition for 12 
months unless a change of residence is made. However, City rules allow 
non-discipline opportunity transfers to compete if permission is granted by the 
sending and receiving schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson Principal Ramon Castillo said Brambila was granted an opportunity 
transfer requested by her mother, based on Brambila's need for "a change of 
environment." He said there were no restrictions on Brambila's involvement in 
athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt Assistant Principal Arturo Del Rio said he has found no 
irregularities with the July transfer, based on discussions with Brambila who 
denies Chase's allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 The transfers of junior starting forward Hilda Perales from South Gate and 
sophomore reserve center Michelle Rodriguez from Eagle Rock are not being 
investigated.

Q&A; 'GENERAL' READY TO TAKE CHARGE ONE LAST TIME; Q&A: THOMAS F. RILEY, 81, 
WILL BE CHAIRMAN IN HIS FINAL YEAR ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. NETTLESOME 
ISSUES, INCLUDING THE EL TORO BASE CONVERSION, AWAIT HIM.

<P>
 In an office crammed with mementos of visits with popes and presidents, 
Supervisor Thomas F. Riley has been preparing for his 20th and final year in 
Orange County politics. 
</P>
<P>
 For Riley, known as "the General," the final chapter will be punctuated by his 
elevation Tuesday to the top position in county government, chairman of the 
Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 He is 81 and represents sprawling South County. In December, Riley was 
hospitalized with a serious foot ailment. But during an interview last week, 
there was no talk of slowing down. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley said he hopes to tackle a range of issues this year, including charting 
the civilian conversion of El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, allaying 
residents' fears about increasing local crime and squaring a $3.5-billion 
budget in the face of a lagging recession. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: How is your health? And will it cause you to scale back your 
activities as board chairman this year? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: "You know, I feel really good. I feel like my interest and excitement 
is there. I really don't anticipate that my illnesses are going to interfere 
with doing a good job. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a matter of fact, I got out of the hospital a little earlier than they had 
anticipated. I'm being very conscientious in responding to the treatment (the 
doctors) have prescribed." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 QHow will your leadership style differ from outgoing Chairman Harriett M. 
Wieder? 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A "I think I can explain this, but I don't want to (offend) my colleagues. No. 
1, I believe that my 30 years in the Marine Corps and the fact that I reached 
the rank of general is an indication that I am successful with employee 
relationships. I think this has been substantiated a great deal during this 
illness period when people have indicated their excitement about my being on 
this job. 
</P>
<P>
 "My style will be a little bit different. I'll stick pretty close to the 
business at hand. . . . (Communications with the staff), that is something that 
has to be expanded. You have to satisfy yourself that the action that is being 
proposed is the appropriate one. With the leadership responsibility, you have 
to know more than that about it. That's going to take more time. I have a 
responsibility to (other board members) that when I go down (to the weekly 
board meetings) I am prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 QWhat would you like most to accomplish? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A "I have been in touch with staff people on projects that I think will make 
Orange County a better place to live. That's my goal. (The civilian conversion 
of) El Toro is obviously an essential part of what we're talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 QEarlier this year, you said that the power struggle pitting the county 
against local cities for planning authority of El Toro Marine Corps Air Station 
was the saddest point in your career on the board. What have you learned from 
that experience? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A "Maybe it isn't learning, but maybe it's just re-confirming that people 
haven't changed much. If you remember when Supervisor Gaddi Vasquez and I came 
out with our first (leadership) proposition, all of the South County people 
were apparently somewhat opposed to what was happening, but there was little 
interest in the rest of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "As time went on, word got out -- in one case -- that there would be 
$1-million-a-year profit to all cities to have a major airport there. 
Eventually, all 31 cities began to put the heat on as to what should be done 
with El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cities like Anaheim and cities where tourism is a major part of their 
finances, (thought) another airport would be in their best interest. . . . 
These northern cities, some of them would probably not even know how to get to 
El Toro. All of the sudden, you know, it's like they can get something for 
nothing. . . . Expeditious action would have been in everybody's best interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "And, I might as well tell you right now that I think there is a damn good 
chance, a damn strong chance, that the Marines might not move (from El Toro to 
Miramar in San Diego County). They have so underestimated the cost of moving, 
by about $364 million from the initial costs, that I understand that (the total 
cost) is up to $1.72 billion. And our friend, the (endangered species) 
gnatcatcher, has reduced the amount of usable land. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be surprised if the (federal base closure) committee doesn't take 
another look at that and find that the best interest of the military and the 
Department of Defense would be to turn Miramar over to the public." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 QIn the face of increasing annexations and the erosion of the county's 
constituent base, some city officials have said that the Board of Supervisors 
no longer wields the political influence it once did. How true is that 
perception? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A "I don't think there is much truth there. We still have a budget of what, 
$3.5 billion. There are lots of things like health care, lots of other services 
that we provide. The need for Sheriff's Department's activities are still 
pretty great. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was kind of disappointed when I read the comment from the city of Irvine 
which said we were down to representing about 150,000 people. I've never really 
heard concerns like that expressed outside of that one time. Certainly, with 31 
cities, there is less unincorporated area. We still provide a lot services. We 
still are a conduit to the Congress and Legislature." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 QThere has been much discussion about a confidence crisis in government as a 
whole. How much damage was done to the public's trust in county government when 
former Supervisor Don R. Roth resigned last year and was later convicted on 
state ethics violations? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A "I don't see community leaders taking a stand and screaming. It certainly 
isn't a grass-roots thing. . . . All I'm pointing out is that I think it's 
human nature for people to be excited about things that impact them or their 
pocketbooks. If it doesn't, it's pretty difficult to get them excited." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 QYou didn't think that the Roth resignation and conviction was a major 
concern? (In the wake of Roth's conviction, the county passed a new law that 
forbids county officials from accepting meals, trips or other gifts.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A "Well, it certainly has impacted us in other ways, you know, with the gift 
ban. For instance, I usually have dinner with our Washington (lobbyist) who we 
pay. When he comes in, I can see nothing wrong with that. Last time, we went to 
dinner, I felt obligated to pay for my own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going out to dinner with some friends tonight and I accepted on the basis 
that I pay for the deal. These are social things. I'm not exactly sure that's 
what everybody's talking about. But at the same time, in this day's climate, I 
told (wife) Emma Jane that I'd rather be safe than sorry." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 QWhat will be the county's strategy for protecting its local revenue as the 
state attempts to emerge from the recession? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A The budget "is just going to be one of those challenging things that we're 
going to have to bite the bullet on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, the sheriff is going to be difficult. We can't put them in an 
exempt area. Police and fire are important to the county community, but I think 
we have to (consider) that with what we do in other (government service) areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing that I have done on this board that has given me more mail 
than when (after an additional $300,000 was found in the budget last year) we 
were able to keep the (county) libraries open."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 QHas the Orange County state legislative delegation been aggressive enough in 
protecting the county's interests? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A "You know that I have a strong feeling of (state Sen.) Marian Bergeson. She 
does a lot for us and we utilize her a lot because of that response. I'm not 
sure we get the same amount of enthusiasm from the others as we get from her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we're all individuals. I suppose some feel that they may owe their 
allegiance to others who are interested in them being maintained in office. I 
have to believe there will be (improvement)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 QThe influx of new immigrants to Orange County has been cited as a major drain 
on local government resources. How well is the county responding to the needs 
of immigrants? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A "I think we are responding generally to the call from those who have a need, 
to a degree that I don't know that we can continue it. There is much to be 
done, but we're pretty much handicapped. It's a federal issue. I guess you 
could say we could start cutting back on support activities, but is that 
humane? The fact that a baby out here can't get the hospitalization it needs is 
not the baby's fault." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 QWhat more can the county do to help allay residents' concern about increasing 
violent crime? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A "The county has several gang programs in which significant effort is being 
made to understand the reasons why these things may be happening, trying to 
come up with a solution to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gee, I never thought I would see the day when this gang thing would arrive in 
Orange County and I was absolutely certain it wouldn't arrive in the 5th 
District. All of a sudden, these things have come up. I think we have been 
aggressive in trying to come up with a solution."

COUNTY SALES OF HANDGUNS SOAR TO 50,600; WEAPONS: THAT 1993 ESTIMATE, SUPPLIED 
BY THE STATE, REPRESENTS A 102% INCREASE OVER A SEVEN-YEAR PERIOD, AND FAR 
EXCEEDS THE COMPARABLE STATEWIDE RATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County gun buyers, whose weapons purchases surpass the California 
average by almost half, bought more than twice as many handguns last year as 
they did seven years ago, according to newly released figures from the state 
Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Handgun sales in Orange County, second only to those in Los Angeles County, 
are projected to have topped 50,600 last year, compared to only 25,026 in 1986, 
when record-keeping began. Elsewhere in the state, handgun sales over the same 
seven-year period increased by roughly 70%, compared to the 102% increase in 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Local police officials have long maintained that the proliferation of handguns 
in the county is partly to blame for the dramatic increase in reported violent 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, serious crime in Orange County has actually decreased on a per-capita 
basis over the past seven years. But crimes of violence -- murder, rape, 
robbery and aggravated assault -- soared by 32% during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase in violent crime, however, could be somewhat exaggerated due to a 
change in the state's crime reporting policy in 1986: Serious domestic assaults 
-- previously reported in a separate category -- were considered to be 
aggravated assaults, one of the eight serious felony crimes tracked nationally 
by the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 No one contends, however, that the dramatic increases in murders -- 
particularly gang-related slayings -- are any less than they are reported to 
be. 
</P>
<P>
 It was because of the large number of violent crimes committed here that 
Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen this week selected Orange County -- once 
considered a haven from its more violent neighbor to the north -- as one of 10 
localities nationwide where federal authorities will begin investigating the 
origin of firearms used in crimes. The effort will look at how the weapons were 
brought in, who transferred them, and where they came from. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a U.S. Department of Justice study, the 10 metropolitan areas, 
including Los Angeles and San Diego counties, account for 23% of the nation's 
felonies -- crimes serious enough to warrant prison terms instead of time in a 
local jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the new federal investigation of firearms is completed, authorities may 
have more concrete answers to questions at the heart of a national debate over 
the relationship between legal firearms sales and violent crime. Among the 
questions to be answered are: Do criminals use handguns purchased from firearms 
dealers? Are these firearms dealers the sporting goods stores or the pawn shops 
that advertise guns in the Yellow Pages? Or do criminals get their weapons from 
a less visible network of arms merchants? 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 1,600 gun dealers with firearms licenses in Orange County in 1992, less 
than 100 of them were engaged in open retail commerce with the public. Most of 
the remaining gun dealers, federal officials said, are individuals who buy and 
sell firearms from locations that range from back rooms in their homes to the 
trunks of their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 In a transparent attempt to drive some of the smaller arms dealers out of the 
business, the Clinton Administration announced with considerable fanfare this 
past week a sharp increase in the fee for a federal firearms license to $600 
annually -- nearly 10 times higher than the fees adopted under recently enacted 
gun control legislation known as the Brady bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1968, dealers have paid $30 for a three-year license. With passage of 
the Brady bill, the fee for a three-year license was to increase to $200 for 
new licensees, with a $90 renewal fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration spokesmen have said that the steep increase will drive out 80% 
of the individual gun dealers, many of whom are hobbyists who acquire the 
licenses just so they can buy firearms at wholesale prices, avoid state and 
local taxes, or ship weapons across state lines. 
</P>
<P>
 But in interviews, many Orange County gun owners and gun dealers criticized 
that view, arguing that the proposal is a possible prelude to confiscation of 
arms. They are being unfairly punished for criminals' misdeeds, the owners and 
dealers said, adding that neither the license fee increases nor the cooling-off 
period newly imposed by the Brady bill would hamper people who are already 
selling firearms illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 "All (the Clinton Administration) is doing with this approach is trying to 
eliminate law-abiding citizens from dealing firearms," said an angry Barry 
Kahn, a corporate owner of Westminster's B & B Sales, whose 20,000-gun 
inventory makes it one of the largest gun dealerships in Orange County. "They 
are blaming us for crimes we didn't commit, crimes committed by people who 
aren't being punished properly." 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County last year, the number of homicides reached a record high. 
There were 212 murders in 1993 compared to 173 the year before. A decade ago, 
there were 83 homicides in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Such statistics, gun dealers and law enforcement officials said, prompt more 
people to arm themselves for protection. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are getting to a point where they feel that they can be endangered no 
matter where they are," said Bob Stevens, an owner of Hock It to Doc pawnshop 
in Anaheim, one of about 30 in Orange County licensed to sell firearms. "Your 
castle is not safe anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 While Stevens and other dealers are reluctant to discuss the number of 
handguns they sell for business or security reasons, all said that most 
prospective buyers these days are interested in firearms for protection, and 
not for sports as in years past. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Gordon, 42, of Costa Mesa has owned a rifle and a handgun since 1970, 
and he said he uses them mostly for target shooting in the desert. However, 
these days he thinks of the guns as instruments that will save his life in case 
of a burglary or robbery at his home, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you own a gun and are responsible, having a gun would make you feel more 
confident and calm about living in a dangerous world because you don't feel 
like a victim," Gordon said one day as he perused a glass case of semiautomatic 
handguns at the Grant Boys gun store in Costa Mesa. "We live in a changing 
world. . . . I'd like to be prepared and not wait until someone comes through 
my door and I have no way of defending myself." Tale of the Guns 
</P>
<P>
 Handgun sales by dealers have risen steadily in Orange County, increasing 76% 
between 1986 and 1992, the most recent full year for which information is 
available. Based on the 37,940 guns sold in the first nine months, the 1993 
total will reach 50,600 -- an increase of more than 100% over the past seven 
years. Orange County sales by dealers: 
</P>
<P>
 1988: 28,071 1989: 33,571 1990: 35,382 1991: 36,058 1992: 44,012 County 
Comparison 
</P>
<P>
 During the first nine months of 1993, the most recent period for which 
information is available, Southern California's five urbanized counties were 
the busiest in the state for handgun sales. The combined total equaled 61% of 
sales in California during the period. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles: 95,882 Orange: 37,940 San Diego: 20,883 San Bernardino: 16,956 
Riverside: 14,222 Hottest Market 
</P>
<P>
 Although more guns are sold in Los Angeles County than any other, Orange 
County has by far the highest rate of sales in Southern California. Gun sales 
per 10,000 residents in 1992: 
</P>
<P>
 Orange: 172.1 Los Angeles: 127.8 Riverside: 116.3 San Bernardino: 116.0 San 
Diego: 106.7 5-county region: 129.2 Statewide: 116.4 Market Share Increasing 
</P>
<P>
 Handgun sales in Orange County as a percentage of all sales in the state and 
in the local five-county region have increased steadily, if slowly. County as a 
percentage of statewide, Southern California sales:

LIBRARY BUILDS ON CHILDREN'S LOVE OF READING; CITY SERVICES: HUNTINGTON BEACH 
UNVEILS 43,000-SQUARE-FOOT ADDITION DESIGNED TO HELP YOUNG PATRONS DISCOVER FUN 
OF LEARNING.

 As the brass band struck up "When You Wish Upon a Star" on Saturday morning, 
the sliding glass doors opened and a throng of several hundred children and 
parents rushed in. Within minutes, the crowd was mesmerized by shooting 
fountains, a giant aquarium of colorful tropical fish, a 15-foot sailboat 
filled with toys and lively sessions of storytelling. 
</P>
<P>
 This was not the opening of a new Disneyland attraction, but the debut of a 
43,000-square-foot wing of the Huntington Beach Central Library, which includes 
what city officials say is the largest children's section west of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Designers of the $9-million addition said the library's fanciful features are 
intended to lure children into the world of reading and learning as early as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 But many youngsters in the opening-day crowd, including some who were barely 
walking, were already avid library fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Becker of Huntington Beach said his daughter, Sara, has been coming to 
the library with him ever since she was born 5 1/2 years ago. For the first few 
years he checked out library books to read to her and recently, he said 
proudly, she began to read on her own. 
</P>
<P>
 "She wanted to celebrate the new library wing because (the library) is already 
part of her life," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three-year-old Noah Obert made a beeline to 'Oh Say Can You Say' by Dr. Seuss 
and sat attentively on the knee of his grandmother, Alice Obert, as she started 
reading. "When he was born we got him a T-shirt that said 'Born to Read' and 
maybe that was right," Grandma said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 Library officials that many parents seem especially anxious to help their 
children get a head start in the competition of life by encouraging them to 
read. 
</P>
<P>
 Several parents at Saturday's open house said they were grateful that the city 
was willing to invest in such an elaborate facility at a time when city and 
library budgets are tight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is fabulous that this city has the interest and resources to do 
this for the children," said Lynn Perryman of Huntington Beach, who brought her 
6-year-old son, Nick, to sign up for a library card. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Noble, an architect with Anthony & Langford, said he had "a ball" 
designing the children's library. He built the wing around a marine theme. 
Among the special flourishes are a 500-gallon saltwater aquarium with blue and 
yellow tropical fish, a blue life-sized sailboat filled with "reading 
readiness" toys where tots can play and a storytelling theater that youngsters 
enter through a child-size door. 
</P>
<P>
 Noble said the 16,000-square-foot children's library is "not just a place to 
store books. It is a place where you can get kids intrigued and excited about 
using a library and hopefully they will stay that way all their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Library Director Ron Hayden said additional space for the library's youngest 
patrons was sorely needed. He said although the library has 30,000 child 
library cardholders, accounting for a third of the library's total circulation, 
it formerly had only 4,000 square feet of its original 75,000-square-foot 
building dedicated to children. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Hayden said, previously there was scant opportunity for youngsters 
to read or study in the library because the cramped children's section, tucked 
in a downstairs corner of the building, contained only two tables and eight 
chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, he said, the new children's section, housed in a wing with large 
windows overlooking the city's sprawling Central Park, has 14 tables and about 
40 chairs for book reading and research and a separate room where youngsters 
can use computers to learn mathematics and language skills. The library is at 
7111 Talbert Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 The children's section is located on the upper floor of the new two-story 
wing. Hayden said several meeting rooms and a 319-seat playhouse that were 
built on the lower level will be rented out to raise money to repay a 
$5-million loan that the city used for the new wing's construction. The 
remaining $4-million cost of construction, he said, was raised by library 
support groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Library officials said the new library wing contains the same 45,000 
children's books that were in the old library. Their next goal, they said, will 
be to update the collection, replacing dogeared volumes and buying more copies 
of the most popular books. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the approximately 6,000 visitors to the new wing Saturday seemed 
pleased. Six-year-old Ryan Wills pronounced it "great." A highlight, he said, 
was when he won a coupon for a free soda after completing a treasure hunt game 
that required children to tour all parts of the library. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan's father, Mike Wills, said he and his wife are education conscious and 
have encouraged their children's love of reading. "We drew the line at reading 
to them in the womb, although we did talk to them," he said jokingly. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great place to look up books," said Thu Xuan Nguyen, a 
seventh-grader at Mesa View Middle School in Huntington Beach, who was busy 
punching at a computer to find sources for a report she is doing on comparative 
religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Natalie Rosso of Huntington Beach was pushing her 9-month-old daughter, Teresa 
Ghione, around the children's library in a stroller. She said the infant, who 
was sucking a pacifier, had a drawer of storybooks at home.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was very exciting when recently she learned to turn the pages," Rosso 
said. "Soon we will be spending a lot of time here." Adding a Library Wing The 
Huntington Beach Central Library unveiled its new 43,000-square-foot wing 
Saturday, including a 16,000-square-foot children's section touted as the 
largest west of Chicago. A look at the library's expansion project: * 
</P>
<P>
 Fast Facts * Cost: New wing cost $9 million; Huntington Beach funded $5 
million and donations the rest. * Size: Entire library, including new wing, is 
118,000 square feet. * Contents: New children's section features 45,000 books, 
14 tables, 40 chairs, an aquarium and fountains. * Children: 30,000 
card-holders under 18 account for one-third of book circulation. * Book 
borrowing: With new wing, book circulation among children expected to increase 
25%. * Electronic sorter: One-of-a-kind conveyor belt picks up returned books, 
electronically scans and sorts them for reshelving. * Theater: Huntington Beach

GREGORY OSBORNE, RENOWNED BALLET DANCER, DIES AT 39 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ANNA CEKOLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gregory Osborne, guest artist with many of the world's most prestigious ballet 
companies and whose classic good looks helped make him a favorite in the 
traditional dance repertoire, died Saturday in the city where he was raised. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne, who looked more like a prototypal surfer than a ballet dancer, was 39 
and died of cancer, a family spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 His death was a blow to admirers abroad and in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "He really was an extraordinary talent," said Thomas R. Kendrick, former 
president of the Orange County Performing Arts Center. "He was clearly one of 
the great talents to come from this area." 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne made one of several homecoming appearances at the Orange County 
Performing Arts Center in 1988 when he appeared with the National Ballet of 
Canada in a performance of "The Four Temperaments." 
</P>
<P>
 He also performed with the American Ballet Theatre and many other ballet 
companies throughout his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley Holden, the director of a West Los Angeles dance academy where Osborne 
studied as a young dancer, described him as a brilliant dancer and a friendly, 
warm person who had stayed in touch with his old friends, even as his career 
took him around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a very special person," said Holden, head of the Stanley Holden Dance 
Center. "Everybody loved him. When he returned to Los Angeles on vacation and 
came here to keep himself in shape, everybody in the professional class with 
him used to love watching him. He was a pure classicist and a very beautiful 
person." 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe it," he said. "Another beautiful person gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne, who turned to dancing as therapy after he broke both legs in a 
sledding accident when he was a boy, became intrigued with dance as a possible 
profession while in his early teens. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Louisville, Ky., Osborne -- whose family moved to Newport Beach in 
1968 -- began studying with Lila Zali, founder of Ballet Pacifica, when he was 
a sophomore at Corona del Mar High School. 
</P>
<P>
 He also studied at the North Carolina School of the Arts, starred as Patrick 
in a Corona del Mar High School production of "Auntie Mame" and was encouraged 
by Ferdinand Nault, director of Les Grands Ballets Canadiens. 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher Jo Black-Jacob said Osborne was one of the "top talents" she ever had 
in her drama classroom at Corona del Mar High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was unbelievable," she said. "He could sing, dance and act. . . . He was 
super hyper and always go, go, go." 
</P>
<P>
 Before arriving in New York at age 19 to take on the dance world, he attended 
Texas Christian University, rushing through to complete his bachelor's degree 
in fine arts in only three years. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined the American Ballet Theatre in the 1970s and won a bronze medal at 
the First International Ballet Competition in Jackson, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
 His renown spread, and in 1983 he left the American Ballet Theatre for what he 
felt were more promising roles as a principal classics dancer with the National 
Ballet of Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 He became best known for his performances in "Les Sylphides," "Swan Lake," 
"Sleeping Beauty," "La Bayadere" and "Giselle." 
</P>
<P>
 Modern dancing, he told The Times in 1983, "doesn't make my mind and my body 
activate like the classics." 
</P>
<P>
 Reviewing a 1988 performance of John Cranko's "Onegin" at the Pasadena Civic 
Auditorium, Times dance critic Lewis Segal said that Osborne -- since his 
affiliation with the Canadian ballet -- "has developed into a distinctively 
heroic danseur noble. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne was also seen regularly with the English National Ballet, the San 
Francisco Ballet and the Royal Danish Ballet. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his career, he appeared with many top ballerinas, including Cynthia 
Gregory, Natalia Makarova, Martine van Hamel and Veronica Tennant. 
</P>
<P>
 He also appeared in several feature films and television specials, including 
"I'm Dancing as Fast as I Can," "The Turning Point" and had a starring role in 
Lewis Furey's motion picture "Shadow Dancing." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990 he left the National Ballet of Canada to pursue a free-lance career. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was undoubtedly the greatest dancer to come out of Orange County," said 
Ashe King, a retired dance studio administrator who met Osborne at age 12. "He 
brought beauty and talent to his chosen profession." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was enormously talented," King said. "It was very obvious even at the age 
of 12." 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne is survived by his mother, Lois; father, Matthew, and brother, 
Richard. A memorial service will be held in Newport Beach, but details are 
pending. In lieu of flowers, family members asked that donations be made to the 
AIDS Services Foundation/Orange County.

SALUTE TO NIXON'S FIRST COMMAND; CELEBRATION: LIBRARY AND BIRTHPLACE OF FORMER 
PRESIDENT WILL FEATURE CHILDREN'S SKIT RECALLING HIS WWII NAVY SERVICE DURING 
81ST BIRTHDAY OBSERVANCE.

 Richard Nixon the Navy commander? 
</P>
<P>
 While most people remember the former President for ending the Vietnam War, 
opening relations with China and resigning amid the Watergate scandal, few are 
aware of his service in World War II. His stint as a naval officer in the South 
Pacific will be recalled today at the Nixon Library & Birthplace as part of the 
celebration of Nixon's 81st birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 The library will feature a children's skit recounting Nixon's wartime service 
as a lieutenant commander, including a scene at "Nick's Snack Shack," where the 
future President handed out free hamburgers and Australian beer to flight 
crews, library spokesman Kevin Cartwright said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yorba Linda, Nixon's hometown, will also celebrate his birthday for the sixth 
consecutive year by closing city offices Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an honor we give him," Yorba Linda Mayor Barbara Kiley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the birthday celebration, Nixon's supporters are making plans for a new 
policy center in his honor: the Richard Nixon Center for Peace and Freedom. 
With branches to be located in Yorba Linda and Washington, the center will be 
"dedicated to the pursuit of enlightened national interest," and "pragmatic 
idealism," Cartwright said. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for the center will be formally announced Jan. 20 -- on the 25th 
anniversary of Nixon's inauguration -- and organizers are closely guarding the 
details until then. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon, along with luminaries from his Administration, including his successor 
in the White House, Gerald R. Ford, and former Cabinet members Henry A. 
Kissinger, George P. Shultz, and Caspar W. Weinberger, are scheduled to be 
present at the library for the Jan. 20 celebration. Ford became President in 
1974 after Nixon's resignation, and Kissinger served as secretary of state 
under both Nixon and Ford. Shultz served as treasury secretary for Nixon and 
later as secretary of state for President Ronald Reagan. Weinberger served as 
secretary of health, education and welfare under Nixon and went on to become 
defense secretary under Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Nixon and his friends will appear at the library in two weeks, 
Cartwright said this Sunday the former President will celebrate his birthday at 
his Park Ridge, N.J., home in the company of his daughters, sons-in-law and 
other family. It is his first birthday since the death of his wife, Pat, who 
died of lung cancer in June, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 As in past years, the Nixon Library & Birthplace will waive the usual $4.95 
admission fee on Sunday and Monday for all visitors. The library will be open 
from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who stay for the half-hour World War II skit will see vignettes of 
Nixon's 1942-45 years on Bougainville and Green Islands in the Solomon Island 
chain. The skits will be performed at 2 p.m. by two local chapters of the 
Children of the American Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon's job was to supervise the loading and unloading of C-47 cargo planes 
that brought in supplies and carried out the wounded, Cartwright said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Nixon never saw combat, he was known as a "first-rate scrounger," 
Cartwright said, quoting from Stephen Ambrose's 1987 biography, "Nixon: The 
Education of a Politician." 
</P>
<P>
 When Nixon arrived at Bougainville Island in January, 1944, he scrounged 
enough ham to give the nine soldiers in his command a ham dinner, Cartwright 
said. Nixon learned just how happy his men were about the food when he censored 
their letters -- part of his job as their commander -- and noted that all of 
them had mentioned the meal, Cartwright said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also at the library is an exhibit honoring the 200th anniversary of the White 
House, "200 Years of Presidential China," displaying rare china and glassware 
from 23 presidential households.

CHILDREN'S MUSEUM PROJECT MOVES CLOSER TO FRUITION; CULTURE: A SANTA ANA 
COMMISSION HAS TENTATIVELY AGREED TO BUY A BANK BUILDING THAT IS TO BE THE SITE 
OF A FACILITY RUN BY BOWERS OFFICIALS AND OPENED BY FALL. 
</P>

<P>
 Plans for a hands-on museum entirely for children have jumped forward with the 
city's tentative decision to buy a bank building for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Bowers Museum of Cultural Art plan to open the children's 
museum this fall in the California Federal Bank Building at 18th and Main 
streets, a few blocks from the Bowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana's Redevelopment Commission last week tentatively approved buying the 
10,500-square-foot building for $675,000. If the plan gets final approval on 
Jan. 18, the city will lease the building to the Bowers for a nominal, 
undisclosed cost. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has essentially gone on has been an amazing stroke of good luck," Bowers 
spokesman Brian Langston said of the city's deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Cribb, president of the Santa Ana Council of Arts and Culture, said the 
museum will provide a much-needed resource for children in the central county 
and will bring together people from diverse cultural backgrounds in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The arts council has been looking at "what art can do as a form of healing" 
for children, Cribb said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Art needs to begin with children," Cribb said. "It needs to be part of their 
experience and education." 
</P>
<P>
 The Discovery Museum of Orange County, which received about $17,000 from the 
city last year and is located in southwest Santa Ana, also is considering 
installing a Discovery Science Center for older children by 1997 near the 
Bowers. Possible sites for the center are on Main Street north of the Santa Ana 
Freeway or an area between 18th and 19th streets near Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Museum officials said they like the idea of having several children's centers 
and museums within walking distance of each other and several schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Most large cities have a park where museums are clustered, said Discovery 
Museum executive director Karen Johnson, citing Balboa Park in San Diego and 
Exposition Park in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County, because it's a multi-city area, has not really had a large 
metropolitan park where cultural institutions are gathered." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowers director Peter Keller said that proposed after-school and field-trip 
classes will be tied to the art of indigenous people worldwide. Officials plan 
four classrooms, a room for puppets and native storytelling and hands-on 
exhibits where children can learn to grind corn or try on native costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tremendous opportunity to give children a space of their own," Bowers 
director Peter Keller said.  
</P>
<P>
 Bowers Museum, a nationally recognized center for art and artifacts, completed 
a four-year, $12-million expansion in 1992. About one-third of the museum's 
$3.1-million budget comes from the city and $1.2 million is from the museum's 
store, restaurant, admission fees and facility rentals. Private donations 
account for the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathy Michaels, director of the Children's Museum at La Habra, said there may 
be competition among museums for corporate resources. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think there's a reasonable number of resources in this county," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Children's museums and cultural centers are growing and becoming popular, 
Michaels said, because "children's programs are hot issues right now. Sponsors 
know that if they don't do something to promote well-educated children, there 
won't be a future for their corporations." 
</P>
<P>
 Keller agreed that "funds for this sort of activity seem to be available. 
People see the importance of children." 
</P>
<P>
 Keller said Bowers Museum cut employees' hours by 10% and their salaries by 5% 
last month, not because of budget shortfalls but to streamline the operation. 
The museum also began shutting its doors one hour earlier last month because 
few people were visiting the museum during late afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Santa Ana will start cutting its funding for the museum by 10% 
each year for 10 years, until the museum is completely privately run, Keller 
said.

OFFICIALS SUSPECT ARSON IN RESTAURANT BLAZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An early morning fire that gutted a strip-mall restaurant and damaged two 
adjacent beauty shops may have been deliberately set, fire officials said 
Saturday. No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Flames had already destroyed the restaurant roof when firefighters responded 
to the blaze at Bahar Royal Persian Cuisine in the 2600 block of East Coast 
Highway, said Newport Beach Fire Department Battalion Chief Donald Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-alarm fire was reported about 4:45 a.m. and was under control by 5:30 
a.m., but not before it caused $400,000 in damage to the restaurant, Jones 
said. "It was already well-involved, burning through the roof by the time we 
arrived," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very seriously looking at arson. There is reason to believe it was a 
deliberately set fire," said Jones, who stressed that an investigation is 
ongoing. "We're treating it as a crime right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said investigators are suspicious because the fire appears to have 
originated in several locations, an indication of arson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Beach Fire Department was assisted by the Huntington Beach and 
Costa Mesa fire departments, Jones said. A total of 34 firefighters and 11 
firefighting units were involved. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant suffered $300,000 in structural damage and $100,000 in damage 
to its contents. It will be closed until repairs are made, Jones said. 
</P>
<P>
 The beauty salons suffered minor exterior damage from the flames, Jones said.

ONE KILLED, TWO INJURED IN GANG-RELATED SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A drive-by shooting left one man dead and another wounded Saturday, and in 
turn sparked a car accident that injured a pedestrian who was apparently the 
third intended target of the gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred just after 3 p.m. at Orange Avenue and Grant Street, an 
intersection frequented by gang members, Santa Ana Police Sgt. Brian R. Collins 
said. The shooting appears to be gang-related, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Collin said witnesses told police that three men were drinking beer near a 
white Mazda pickup parked in front of a house on the southwest corner of Grant 
Street and Orange Avenue when a dark-colored Ford van approached, driving 
slowly northbound on Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 "The van slows to a stop, somebody opens the sliding door, the two groups 
trade some insults and then a guy in the van fires a handgun at the others," 
Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
 One man, Gustavo Velasquez, 29, of Santa Ana, was shot in the chest and taken 
to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana, where he later died, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A second man, who was wounded in the arm and chest, either made his way alone 
or was helped to a house two doors down on Orange Avenue, leaving a trail of 
blood. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the house in the 800 block of Orange at first told police they 
knew nothing about the shooting, but finally allowed officers inside. There, 
police discovered Raul Ortega, 19, who refused medical treatment and also 
declined to cooperate with the investigation, Collins said. Ortega later 
returned to his home several blocks away.  
</P>
<P>
 About 90 minutes after the shooting, a man using a cellular telephone in the 
front yard of the house where Ortega sought help said he did not know Ortega 
but had tried to help. "I just tried to be a good Samaritan," he said. He 
declined to give his name. 
</P>
<P>
 The third injury occurred when a man driving west on Grant Street suddenly 
found himself in the middle of the flying bullets. "He slammed his car into 
reverse, and backed up into the third guy who'd been standing by the pickup," 
Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
 The third man was taken to UCI Medical Center, where he was being treated for 
a separated shoulder and cuts and bruises, authorities said. His name was not 
released, nor was that of the driver, who was not expected to be cited in the 
accident, Collins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Saturday afternoon, the intersection remained blocked off, with yellow, 
plastic cards marking the location of evidence, including eight stray bullets 
and bullet fragments. Police were interviewing potential witnesses, but said 
they had no suspects and little concrete information, other than a description 
of the van. 
</P>
<P>
 A 25-year neighborhood resident who lives a few doors from the scene said 
shootings are frequent occurrences there.

innumerable orchids dripping off trees in the land of their native primeval 
forests. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden tours, it would seem, are sprouting up like weeds. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last 10 years, there has definitely been an increase in the number of 
garden tours offered," says Paul Coopersmith of Coopersmith's England, a 
company that organizes tours to Great Britain and Europe. "And more and more 
tours are being offered to more and more parts of the world. The market is 
really expanding." 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons? "Certainly it reflects the heightening interest in gardening here 
at home," says Coopersmith. "But in large part it's that Americans have become 
more sophisticated as travelers." 
</P>
<P>
 One advantage to joining a garden tour, as opposed to setting out on your own, 
is that you get the benefit of having leaders who are usually knowledgeable in 
the fields of landscape design or horticulture. You also may gain admission to 
private gardens that would otherwise be off limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the trips that follow are geared toward the devoted, even hard-core 
gardener: They travel to several gardens a day, every day. But, says 
Coopersmith, this is not true of all garden-oriented tours. Some participants 
are "not necessarily into gardens that much. But they like small groups, nice 
hotels; they like to walk outside and see lovely things." With that in mind, a 
few of the tours on this list are followed by stars, indicating that they 
include time for regular sightseeing and shopping excursions. Consider them if 
your traveling companion is less enthusiastic than you are about plants.
