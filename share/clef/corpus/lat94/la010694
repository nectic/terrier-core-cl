AROUND TOWN / BEVERLY BEYETTE: ALL ABOUT SUE AND JAY'S EXCELLENT MIDLIFE 
ADVENTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Jay and Sue German told friends they were fleeing the Westside for West 
Adams, the response was predictable: "You're moving to the ghetto?" 
</P>
<P>
 But move they did -- into an 85-year-old California Craftsman where, as 
innkeepers Jay and Sue, they are proprietors of the Salisbury House 
bed-and-breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 Since embarking on their great midlife adventure almost five years ago, they 
have survived riots and recession. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been scary, and it's been hard, Sue says, but "I feel like I'm living in 
a place that's alive." 
</P>
<P>
 In Mar Vista, "We did Girl Scouts and all that. I thought that was a 
neighborhood. But this is an incredible community, so bound up with love and 
concern for one another." 
</P>
<P>
 The Germans live on West 20th Street, an enclave of big, well-tended old homes 
in the shadow of urban blight and the kind of unsightly businesses people try 
to keep out of their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 So what brought the Germans here? 
</P>
<P>
 It started with a trip to New Zealand. Smitten with B-and-B's, they began to 
fantasize about crackling fires, feather pillows and fascinating people coming 
to their doorstep. 
</P>
<P>
 The youngest of their three children was at college. And, at 45, Jay was 
jobless, his company having been acquired in a takeover. They decided to go for 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 They considered Maine, toyed with Sacramento. During their yearlong search, a 
realtor showed them the Salisbury House, so they could see what could be done 
to these old places. 
</P>
<P>
 When it went on the market, furnished, the Germans bought it -- lock, stock 
and stained glass windows -- for $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Sue says, came "the hard part, emotionally. I was suddenly in this place 
where nothing belonged to me and all these strangers were here." 
</P>
<P>
 Jay remembers it as an unsettling time too. "You've exposed yourself and your 
material beings to strangers. They tell us they're John Doe. They could be 
Richard Ramirez." 
</P>
<P>
 But things were going swimmingly -- until the riots of 1992. Overnight, Jay 
says, "People who know where we are weren't coming here." Cancellations poured 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's never come all the way back. When callers ask about the area, Sue is 
candid. During the riots, there was burning and looting just two blocks away.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather not have them come than come and be quaking on the front steps," 
Sue says. "This is my home. It hurts me." 
</P>
<P>
 When the heavy old door with the beveled glass pane has closed behind guests, 
they are in a 3,500-square-foot world of dark-stained wood, Victoriana and 
lace. 
</P>
<P>
 They all want to know where to eat. So, Jay, public-relations director for 
Claremont Graduate School, has put together "Mr. Grub's Guide to Largely Good, 
Cheap Eats." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nestle folks have used the Germans' big, high-ceilinged kitchen for 
tollhouse-cookie commercials and the house was seen in "Dragon: The Bruce Lee 
Story." 
</P>
<P>
 "That 'Dragon' shoot got us through the hard times after the riots," Sue says. 
</P>
<P>
 Half a dozen brides, including the Germans' daughter, Lisa, have been married 
in Salisbury House or its garden. "In our back yard, you could be in Dubuque," 
Jay says. Adds Sue, "If it weren't for the occasional helicopters." 
</P>
<P>
 The happy surprises have outnumbered the unhappy ones. True, the roof needed 
repairs, as did the electrical and the plumbing. But, Jay says, this is not 
"The Money Pit." 
</P>
<P>
 And of course, there have been guests and guests. The Germans won't soon 
forget the bunch dressed all in black with white makeup and "lots of 
piercings." 
</P>
<P>
 The Germans have plunged into community life. Their response to the two-day 
power outage during the riots? Invite the neighbors to bring over what was in 
their refrigerators. "We had two really neat parties," Sue says. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, West Adams was a stable upper-middle-class black community, but 
white families have been buying and renovating some of the old houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are occasional little pockets of resentment," Sue says. "We kind of had 
to earn our spurs." Now, Jay adds, "You can't walk down the street without 
getting 30 hellos and an offer of a drink." 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood association, with Sue as president, has gated off alleys 
that, she says, "were used for drug dumping and prostitution." It also has 
graffiti paint-outs, Easter egg hunts and summer block parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Mar Vista," Sue says, "if you heard a police helicopter, everyone locked 
their doors. Here, everybody goes outside to find out what's going on -- and to 
see if everybody's all right." Great Gretzkyabilia 
</P>
<P>
 For Barry Dvorkin, Aug. 9, 1988 -- the day Wayne Gretzky was traded from the 
Edmonton Oilers to the Los Angeles Kings -- ranks near the top of his all-time 
list of notable dates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a national holiday up here," recalls Dvorkin, who lives in Calgary, 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Dvorkin, you see, is an avid Calgary Flames fan. He hates the Oilers. "If the 
Oilers were playing the Russians, I'd be for the Russians." And, when the 
Oilers had the great Gretzky, they regularly extinguished the Flames. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's Dvorkin doing traveling around the West with a $25,000 stash of 
Gretzky memorabilia? Hoping to sell it, that's what. He recently turned up at a 
sports-card collectors show in Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
 His Gretzkyabilia includes an autographed, game-worn Kings jersey, circa 1990. 
Rare, Dvorkin says. "Wayne keeps really close track of his stuff." The most 
unique item? An invitation to Gretzky's wedding: "I got it from a friend of a 
friend, who got it off a guy who'd been there." (Value: about $1,000). 
</P>
<P>
 There's a game sheet from the game in which Gretzky broke Gordie Howe's 
all-time scoring record. "There's only three of these in existence," he claims. 
Dvorkin also brought to Walnut some Gretzky dolls -- but without their clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They gave me a hard time at the border about the doll clothes," Dvorkin says. 
"I guess there's some kind of quota on textiles made in Taiwan. It was silly 
because they're toys, but they wouldn't let me bring them over." 
</P>
<P>
 Think $10,000 is a bit steep for a jersey? 
</P>
<P>
 "The day Gretzky retires, you can times two everything," Dvorkin says. "It's 
tough for me to say this, believe me, but everybody knows that Wayne Gretzky is 
the best hockey player who ever lived."

ON VIEW / MARY LOU LOPER: 25TH ANNIVERSARY TO REUNITE NIXON CABINET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU LOPER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Special events and luncheons will surround festivities in Yorba Linda when 
former President Richard Nixon is at the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace 
later this month to celebrate the 25th anniversary of his inauguration as the 
37th President of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those attending the affairs will be former President Gerald Ford and 
former Nixon cabinet members including Secretaries of State Henry A. Kissinger 
and William P. Rogers; Secretaries of the Treasury George P. Shultz and William 
E. Simon (who also is president of the Nixon library foundation); Health, 
Education and Welfare Secretaries Caspar Weinberger and Robert Finch; Secretary 
of Defense James R. Schlesinger; Housing and Urban Development Secretary George 
Romney; Secretaries of Commerce Peter G. Peterson and Maurice H. Stans; 
Secretary of Labor James Hodgson; Secretary of the Interior (now Alaska 
governor) Walter J. Hickel; Secretary of Transportation Claude S. Brinegar and 
Postmaster General Winton M. Blount. 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of it all, the Music Center's prominent volunteer group, the Blue 
Ribbon, has been invited for a guided tour of the library. Nixon, who turns 81 
this Sunday and has kept a quiet profile since the death of his wife, Pat, has 
agreed to attend the group's post-tour luncheon and to make informal remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 Responsible for that event are Caroline Ahmanson, chairwoman of the library's 
President's Council, and Marcia Wilson Hobbs. They were finalizing arrangements 
this week with the facility's library director John Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 The library is commemorating the 200th anniversary of the White House with a 
special exhibit, which includes "Dining at the White House: 200 Years of 
Presidential China" and "The White House 1792-1992: Image and Architecture." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Blue Ribbon president Sandra Ausman, White House chief curator 
Rex Scouten will speak. Then, Ribboners shuttle back in buses to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Tribute: Speaking of Nixon, the late Athalie Richardson Irvine Clarke was 
his close friend. He named her "the First Lady of Orange County."  
</P>
<P>
 A memorial exhibition in Clarke's honor will open at the Yorba Linda Nixon 
Library in May. It will consist of 50 paintings that were displayed in Clarke's 
home as well as paintings she donated to the Irvine Museum. The exhibition will 
be accompanied by a book with a biographical essay by Clarke's daughter, ardent 
California Impressionist collector Joan Irvine Smith . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Museum's first anniversary show opens Jan. 19. It will pay homage 
to its neighbor museum in Laguna Beach, the Laguna Art Museum (celebrating its 
75th anniversary) by showcasing nearly 70 paintings by artists including Edgar 
Payne, William Wendt, Anna Hills, Benjamin Brown and Joseph Kleitsch, all of 
whom exhibited in the Laguna museum's first exhibition in 1918. 
</P>

 Circle Red: The Los Angeles Music Center Opera's black-tie opening night of 
"El Gato Montes" Jan. 29 . . . And, the Fashion Circle of the Costume Council 
of the Los Angeles County Museum of Art dinner-dance Jan. 21 at Chasen's, 
honoring Gloria Vanderbilt. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 San Marino Debs: Gold-capped columns draped with boxwood garlands, trees 
trimmed in gold lame and Dutch flowers surrounded by candlesticks in silken 
shades glamorized the Debutante Ball for the National Charity League, San 
Marino Area chapter, at the Beverly Wilshire.  
</P>
<P>
 For Ticktockers, as the debs are known in their charity work, the ball was the 
culmination of six years of volunteer service. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking pride in the night were chapter president Janie DeCastro and ball 
co-chairwomen Susan DePietro and Lora Hosek. 
</P>
<P>
 Debutantes were Susan Rusnack, Stephanie DeCastro, Suzanne Tanner, Bevin 
Allen, Lauren Cameron, Jennifer Sinclair, Carrie Sullivan, Susan Chambers, 
Stefanie Fremdling, Leslie Dam, Michelle Sutantyo, Jennifer Paine, Courtney 
Powell, Courtney Ingle, Marie Martinez, Marilyn Roubal and Annelies Jonker. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Look: Mimi Howes put her unique artistry into the elegant tea for new June 
debutantes of the Pasadena Guild of Childrens Hospital. The blooming pink 
Debutante camellia bush at the front entrance to guild president Rary Simmons' 
San Marino residence set the theme. Inside, Howes placed pink camellias in 
vials on the Christmas tree and laced the tree with old-fashioned silver 
tinsel. The chandelier above the dining room tea table was entwined with a 
marvelous bouquet. 
</P>
<P>
 The debs carried pink camellias. They're a friendly group: Amy Coleman, 
Kristen Capalbo, Melissa Bruce, Kelly Martin, Heidi Gilbaugh, Stephanie 
DeCastro, Galen Moore, Susan Rusnack, Megan Rader, Sarah Schoellkopf, Carrie 
Sullivan and Kristin Podley. 
</P>
<P>
 Involved, too, were ball chairwoman Susan Seidel, tea chairwoman Doris Ann 
Williams and debutante chairwoman Karen Hammond. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kudos: To Alyce Williamson, honored by Kelsey Hall at a birthday luncheon in 
the California Club French Room . . . To Susan Kranwinkle, moving to New York 
with attorney husband Doug and honored by Louise Reich at a tea in Reich's home 
. . . To Nancy McCullough, Carlotta Keeley, Julie Russell and Judy Getto, 
hosting the Children's Chain Christmas Tea at the Valley Hunt Club with lots of 
children and grandmothers dressed to the nines for cookie-munching. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Plaudits: To Ginie and Henry Braun, feting Jamie and Orel Hershiser after the 
Hershisers bought the Brauns' Pasadena home. Ginie Braun also honored Jeanne 
Hall at a luncheon at the Annandale Golf Club . . . To Bonnie Baker, hosting a 
California Club tea to honor Martha Bricker, Betty Morgan and Violette Nason 
for their support for West Coast University.

 Several 1994 items qualify for the "why didn't somebody think of this before?" 
category. They range from products for bathrooms and babies to grocery boxes, 
window shades and bottle tops. 
</P>

 Curtain Call: SnapUps can ease one of the most aggravating household chores -- 
putting up a shower curtain -- by eliminating the struggle to slip plastic 
rings through the holes in the curtain and close them over the rod. 
</P>
<P>
 SnapUps are shower curtains with their own vinyl tabs that slip over the rod 
and snap in place on top of the curtain. Each tab is the same color as the 
curtain and is reinforced with heavier vinyl so it won't tear easily. (People 
with arthritis will find the new curtains a real snap.) 
</P>
<P>
 Introduced by Tex Style Inc. of Cincinnati, SnapUps (70 by 72 inches) come in 
five embossed vinyl patterns ($4.99) in ecru, blue, rose, teal, dark green, 
black or white. By spring, they will be available in additional vinyl patterns 
and several fabric patterns ($6.99 to $16.99). The company also plans to 
manufacture seasonal curtains with goblins or ghosts for Halloween and Santas 
for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 SnapUps are available nationwide in most K mart and Wal-Mart stores or by 
calling Tex Style, (800) 875-8001. 
</P>

<P>
 Cabinet Caddy: Medicine Cabinet Organizer is the perfect remedy for that 
typically messy household cupboard. It's an insert for cabinets that lets you 
store toothpastes, toothbrushes, razors and ointments in separate compartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Made of recyclable white polystyrene, the Organizer fits into 90% of bathroom 
medicine chests (standard heights of 17 and 23 inches). It's held in place by 
self-adhesive tape. No tools are needed to install it. 
</P>
<P>
 In 23-inch cabinets, the top of the organizer becomes an additional full 
shelf; for shorter cabinets, the top section snaps off. The left side of the 
Organizer has 1/2-inch snap-off shelf edges to adjust to a narrow cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, the Organizer is divided into two sections. On the left are two 
six-inch permanent shelves to accommodate larger products; on the right, four 
seven-inch adjustable shelves can be snapped into place at 1 1/2-inch 
intervals. 
</P>
<P>
 You can arrange the adjustable side to stand toothpaste tubes upright or to 
hang as many as six toothbrushes, dental picks or razors. 
</P>
<P>
 Medicine Cabinet Organizer ($14.95) is available at Target and 3-D Bed and 
Bath stores or by contacting the manufacturer, Rx for Organization, 6754 Eaton 
Ave., Canoga Park, Calif. 91303; (818) 704-4455.

 Diaper Dumpster: New moms and dads should love Diaper Genie, which keeps 
soiled disposable diapers locked away in an odor-free canister. The 18-inch, 
four-pound container is easy to use at home and transportable for visits to 
relatives or friends. 
</P>
<P>
 The white plastic canister seals dirty diapers in an odor- and germ-resistant 
film. Simply roll up the diaper, insert it in the ring opening in the top of 
the canister, press down and twist. Diaper Genie seals each diaper in film, 
forming a chain of up to 20. When you open the latch at the bottom, the sealed 
diapers are attached in a sausage link-like string ready for disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Diaper Genie (suggested retail, $30) is available nationally at K mart, Sears, 
J.C. Penney, Toys R Us, Target and some Longs Drug Stores. Or order from three 
national catalogues: the Right Start, (800) 548-8531; One Step Ahead, (800) 
274-8440; the Safety Zone, (800) 999-3030. The film rolls, which will seal 180 
diapers, are available in refills for $5.  
</P>
<P>
 In the Los Angeles area, you also can find Diaper Genie at Baby's World in 
Studio City, Bellini in Sherman Oaks and Simi Valley, the Juvenile Shop in 
Sherman Oaks, Bringing Up Baby in Los Angeles, Carousel Baby Furniture in 
Pasadena, and Sid's Baby & Kids Furniture in West Hollywood.

<P>
 Sack Rack: Box Boy solves the problem of keeping grocery sacks from tumbling 
over in the trunk or back of the car. 
</P>
<P>
 Simple in design, Box Boy has four compartments that accommodate grocery sacks 
or plastic bags snugly and keep them upright when you make a quick turn or 
accelerate. The unit is constructed of sturdy (mostly recycled) cardboard and 
folds compactly when not in use. 
</P>
<P>
 Box Boy ($3.50 plus $1.50 shipping and handling) is available in three 
patterns: fruits, vegetables, and stars and stripes. Contact Box Boy, 11601 
Wilshire Blvd., Fifth Floor, Los Angeles, Calif. 90025; (800) 525-2510.

 Paper Drapes: Redecorating your home or moving into a new one? You may need 
Redi Shade, a temporary window shade to cover bare windows until the drapes or 
permanent shades go up. It looks a lot nicer than an old sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 Redi Shades look like traditional cloth-pleated shades but are made of durable 
white paper. They are easy to install with peel-back tape on the top that 
sticks to window glass, frames or painted wall surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Each shade is 36 inches wide and 5 1/2 feet long. If you have a long window, 
you can attach a second shade to the bottom of the first to cover the whole 
surface. Or trim the temporary shades for a shorter opening. 
</P>
<P>
 Redi Shades ($4.99 each) are available nationwide in selected paint and 
hardware stores. In California, you can find them at Home Express stores or 
Home Depot Expo in San Diego. If you can't find them in your area, contact 
Shades Unlimited Inc., 613 Martin Ave., Suite 103, Rohnert Park, Calif. 94928; 
(707) 585-7960.

<P>
 Sip a Go-Go: If you're constantly on the go and like to carry your favorite 
bottled water with you, check out Sip-it Drinking Cap, a reusable cap that will 
turn a container into a sports bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 Sip-it screws onto any size water or soda bottle with a standard neck and 
simply pulls up to open, pushes down to close. It seals tightly, so fluid 
doesn't spill even if the bottle tips. The caps are dishwasher safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Sip-it Drinking Caps ($1 to $1.50 for three caps in green, yellow and neon 
pink) are available nationwide. In Southern California, you can find them at 
Sav-on or Thrifty stores, at Sports Chalet or by contacting JMS Products Inc., 
270 N. Canon Drive Suite 1143, Beverly Hills, Calif. 90210; (800) 743-2002.

 M erry is the operative word here, although sex and violence do figure into 
the equation. Even so, fans of Chandler, Hammett and company may find Judith 
Viorst a tad bland in the department, though she rates at least a six for sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "Murdering Mr. Monti" is actually about thinking of murdering Mr. Monti, an 
exercise that provides ample opportunities for the author's wit and antic 
humor, but offers relatively few chances for overt antisocial acts. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not giving anything away if I tell you that a successful advice columnist 
with two grown sons and a pediatric-surgeon husband is not your typical killer. 
A taut 46, Brenda Kovner is famous for her pot roast; loyal, kind, somewhat 
over-maternal and extremely well-organized. She's proud of her "can-do" 
attitude, which infuses her thousands of readers with confidence. On her good 
days, Brenda resembles Goldie Hawn, a fact bound to make the casting of this 
movie easier. 
</P>
<P>
 The 46th birthday is crucial to the plot, because as the day approaches, 
Brenda decides that she's been deprived of sexual variety, having married at 20 
and committed herself to marital fidelity. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially saddened by this fact, she realizes that it is not immutable. She 
can change it merely by going to bed with a few other men, each carefully 
chosen to combine as many unknown qualities as possible. Ideally, she'd like to 
sleep with a political radical, with a man younger than her husband, Jake, a 
man of a different race, one of a different religion, a genius, a celebrity, 
and an identical twin. 
</P>
<P>
 To her delight, (because Brenda has no desire to make a habit of adultery or 
become unnecessarily promiscuous), she finds three men in her circle of 
acquaintances who possess several of the desirable traits. One qualifies on the 
basis of race, youth and political activism; a TV personality fills the bill 
for fame and genius; and the third candidate is Mr. Monti, who makes the short 
list because he's a twin, married and of another spiritual persuasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Brenda is in no particular hurry to fill the gaps in her store of 
carnal knowledge, she's able to complete the entire project in one extremely 
hectic 24-hour period. Treated with considerable levity, these encounters live 
up to expectations aroused by the subtitle. They also embolden our heroine to 
believe that if she can commit undetected adultery, murder shouldn't be any 
more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Monti is the only man short-listed for murder. He is no disappointment as 
a lover, but none of his other qualities is in the least endearing. He's 
vulgar, prejudiced, fundamentally sexist and adamantly opposed to the marriage 
of his daughter Josephine to Brenda's son Wally. Moreover, he wears a pinkie 
ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Murder would never have occurred to Brenda if Mr. Monti had not persuaded her 
other son, Jeff, to invest all of his worldly assets in an extremely dubious 
urban-renewal project. When the project goes down the tubes, Mr. Monti calls in 
his markers, which include Jeff's entire net worth and then some. Mr. Monti has 
lent Jeff the seed capital, and now wishes to concentrate upon cultivating his 
own financial garden. Various menacing phone calls, notes and scary incidents 
convince Brenda that her son's very life is in danger from Mr. Monti's thugs, 
and her solution is to neutralize the man she believes is causing the trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Pleading and persuasion have failed, and while Brenda believes Jeff has made a 
mistake, paying with his life seems excessive. This is where the overly 
maternal part kicks in. Most mothers would think bank loan or lawsuit, but 
Brenda thinks murder. "I can handle this" is the rule she lives by. 
</P>
<P>
 Handling it proves to be as much fun for the reader as it must have been for 
the writer. Though the results are predictable, the methods Brenda chooses are 
highly ingenious, demonstrating that you can't really learn how to kill from 
watching old movies on the subject, because up until the mid-'60s social codes 
in fiction, film and TV dictated that the guilty be punished. 
</P>
<P>
 Brenda's hottest tip comes from a pair of funeral directors who sit behind her 
on a plane, but events conspire to thwart her plan. In the end, that turns out 
to be the best thing that could have happened, inspiring Brenda to an even more 
imaginative solution, and a satisfactory, if somewhat sentimental, finale. You 
might enjoy the merriment and the sex enough to forget you were promised 
violence and murder.

INK / PAUL D. COLFORD: THE TIDE IS CHANGING FOR AN OBSCURE NOVELIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 For Patrick O'Brian, the writer of sea tales, this was the year his ship came 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of being treasured by a so-called O'Brian underground of fans, the 
obscure novelist appeared to break through on a surge of critical praise 
generated by the recent "The Wine-Dark Sea," his 16th novel set in the 
swashbuckling British Navy of the 19th Century. The ink lavished on the book in 
publications ranging from the New Yorker to People also gave long-overdue 
attention to O'Brian's 15 previous titles, which W.W. Norton & Co. has put back 
into print in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 For the uninitiated -- and many of us had left the genre after those last 
voyages charted by Joseph Conrad and Herman Melville -- it was time to catch up 
on the action-rich adventures of O'Brian's headstrong Capt. Jack Aubrey and his 
shipboard surgeon-spy, Stephen Maturin.  
</P>
<P>
 Here, in "The Wine-Dark Sea," are the two old friends as they puzzle from the 
quarterdeck at a "strange-coloured" swirling sea: 
</P>
<P>
 Aubrey: "I have never seen anything like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Maturin: "It is much thicker now than it was when I went below. And now an 
umber light pervades the whole, like a Claude Lorrain run mad." 
</P>
<P>
 It's this kind of passing historical reference (to the 17th-Century landscape 
artist known for his rendering of light), as well as O'Brian's painstakingly 
researched details about 19th-Century life aboard ship, that elevates his tales 
into heady escapism. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Irish-born author left his home in the south of France and visited 
the United States a few weeks ago, fans waiting to meet, lunch and have tea 
with him included Walter Cronkite, Sen. Dirk Kempthorne (R-Idaho) and Supreme 
Court Justice Anthony Kennedy, who invited O'Brian to attend a session of the 
high court. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood also wants a piece of the press-shy storyteller. Publishers Weekly 
recently reported that the Samuel Goldwyn Co. has optioned O'Brian's first 
novel in the series, "Master and Commander," in a deal that could lead to a 
line of films based on the novels. 
</P>
<P>
 Norton also plans to keep stoking interest in O'Brian by reissuing all his 
books in hardcover starting in the spring and by bringing out two additional 
titles in April. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Golden Ocean," published in Britain 37 years ago, is a precursor to the 
Aubrey-Maturin stories. "Patrick O'Brian: Critical Essays and Bibliography," 
edited by Arthur Cunningham, will offer a historical backdrop to his tales. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for a suddenly hot writer of 79.

 Ruling Could Redirect Royalties: A New York federal court ruling giving 
royalties to the heirs of the man who wrote the song "When the Red, Red Robin 
Comes Bob, Bob, Bobbin' Along" could bring a windfall to the writers of 
favorite old tunes and their descendants. The case was brought by four heirs of 
Harry Woods, a now all-but-forgotten composer whose biggest claim to fame was 
the snappy 1926 hit. Judge Richard Owen ruled that the roughly $100,000 in 
royalties from versions of the song must revert to the composer's heirs and not 
the song's publisher. The publisher, the Bourne Co., contended that the 
versions in question were "derivatives," the royalties for which, under current 
copyright law, go to publishers. All sides agreed that "Red, Red Robin" -- 
performed in various forms over the years by Doris Day, Dean Martin and Al 
Jolson -- was a test case, meaning that the judge's ruling, unless overturned 
on appeal, would apply to virtually all other music copyrighted since the 
1920s.

Vince Gill, George Jones, Brooks & Dunn, Tracy Lawrence and Billy Dean. . . . 
And on cable's TNT, Tritt hosts tonight's "Our Favorite Movies: Winter 
Edition," introducing Elvis Presley's 1957 film, "Jailhouse Rock." Tritt will 
discuss Presley's impact on his life and career.

 Wanna Buy a Theater?: The owners of the 3,000-seat Wayne Newton Theatre in 
tourist mecca Branson, Mo., have put the concert venue up for sale. Newton has 
no financial stake in the theater, and any new owner would have to decide 
whether to continue his contract. Owner Gary Snadon said he and his partners 
would "just like to get out of the theater business." "I didn't lose money, but 
I didn't make any," he told the News-Leader of Springfield. The asking price 
for the theater is $15 million. If it doesn't sell, it will reopen in the 
spring with Newton, Snadon said. MOVIES

TV REVIEW; 'NUNSENSE' STILL FAITHFULLY COMMITTED TO LAUGHTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Musical-comedy fans who haven't caught up with "Nunsense," the spirited revue 
about five frolicsome nuns staging a song-and-dance benefit to raise money to 
bury four of their sisters lying in a convent freezer, have a wonderful 
opportunity to do so tonight. The show has its television premiere on A&E at 6 
p.m. and 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Still running Off Broadway eight years after it opened, the stage show, in its 
warm tone and occasionally raucous satire, may be viewed as a cheerful 
precursor to the "Sister Act" movies, only much funnier.Taped before a 
theatrical audience, the TV production faithfully re-creates the theatergoing 
experience, right down to the nuns' interplay with house patrons, including a 
funny encounter with a Jew mistaken by the entertainers for a Catholic. 
</P>
<P>
 Current and once-upon-a-time Catholic schoolgirls will appreciate Sister Mary 
Regina as the ruler-brandishing Mother Superior (richly performed by Rue 
McClanahan, who's physically hilarious after accidentally sniffing an 
aphrodisiac). But there's not a mean or caustic bone in the whole charming 
artifice (written and created by Dan Goggin and directed for TV by David 
Stern). 
</P>
<P>
 Like the original stage experience (brought to L.A. in 1988), the show is a 
bit corny, too dependent on one-liners and thin on plot, but it's 
unquestionably terrific on a sheer performance level. 
</P>
<P>
 In the show, the stage-struck quintet from the Little Sisters of Hoboken 
gently squeeze the "parishioners" for burial money by explaining that they were 
off playing bingo when their colleagues expired face-down in their soup from 
tainted vichyssoise (prepared by nunnery Chef Julia, Child of God). 
</P>
<P>
 Joining McClanahan as the singing and dancing nuns are Terri White, Semina De 
Laurentis, Christine Anderson and Christine Toy. None of them is exactly Mary 
St. Ignatius, but they're a lot more fun.

UNSAFE AT ANY MEAL?; IN 1993, AMERICANS CAME FACE TO FACE WITH THE HAZARDS OF 
THE NATIONAL FOOD SUPPLY. IT WAS THE YEAR OF EATING DANGEROUSLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For generations, Americans were led to believe that the United States had the 
world's safest food supply. Secure in the knowledge that federal inspectors and 
the food industry would stand guard over the fields, processing plants and 
slaughter houses from which our food comes, we believed that there was little 
risk of anything harmful appearing on our plates, save for the occasional 
unrefrigerated potato salad at a summer picnic. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1993 reality hit: A series of food poisonings -- from strange-sounding 
bacteria, viruses and chemicals -- converged to change the way America thinks 
about food. And the message from both government and industry in response to 
these crises was surprising, but clear: Food preparation has become a game of 
chance, and individual consumers alone are responsible for ensuring that the 
food on their dinner table is safe to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 At hearings and debates throughout the year, government and industry experts 
conceded that the system has grown too large, too complex and too intricate for 
any official or private enterprise to guarantee purity. There is no 
ever-watchful system to swoop in and make everything right when food 
contamination is exposed. And as resources are spread exceptionally thin, 
federal inspection programs continue to fall further behind modern production 
methods or don't exist at all. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, food-borne bacteria continue to evolve into new, more infectious 
strains, with serious and sometimes fatal consequences.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year, for instance, began on a dismal note. Within the first few weeks of 
1993, our confidence in the food supply was shattered by a little-known 
bacteria called E. coli O157:H7, which had taken hold in the seemingly 
innocuous hamburger. Contaminated ground meat served at Jack-in-the-Box and 
purchased from U.S. and Australian suppliers was making people sick up and down 
the Pacific Coast. Hundreds became seriously ill and several children died. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The symbolism of hamburgers as poison prompted public demand that something be 
done. The new Clinton Administration sent a Presidential envoy to Washington 
state in search of causes. But 12 months later, federal officials are no closer 
to knowing the origins of the contaminated meat than they were in January of 
1993. All subsequent investigations have ended without answering the critical 
question of exactly where the system first failed. More important, no one is 
reassuring the public that similar, and more severe, episodes can be prevented 
in the future.  
</P>
<P>
 It's a predictable cycle. Instead of working quickly to find and eliminate the 
sources of food contamination -- and so, reassuring the public -- government 
and industry officials react hastily to each new crisis. Health advisories are 
released, recommended cooking temperatures are raised, toll-free help lines are 
established and inspection crackdowns are launched. Underlying it all is the 
common refrain, from government and industry, that Americans should now 
transform their kitchens into the sanitary equivalent of a hospital operating 
room. But soon thereafter, both the industry and consumers drift back into 
normal, sometimes dangerous, habits.  
</P>
<P>
 But last year, anxiety over food safety seemed to take hold. The E. coli 
outbreak was but one incident undermining the country's Norman Rockwell 
confidence in the wholesomeness of American food. Only 13% of those surveyed in 
1993 by a food industry trade group expressed "complete confidence" that the 
food sold in supermarkets is safe to eat. Still, only 38% said they rely on 
themselves to ensure that their food is safe, with the remainder looking to 
others such as government, food companies and consumer advocates to do the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Precautions long forgotten, or never learned, are only gradually being adopted 
in many homes and restaurants as the cost of food-borne illness -- in terms of 
medical attention, lost wages and reduced productivity -- soars to $4.3 billion 
annually, according to one recent estimate from the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There is little way of knowing the actual financial cost of food-related 
illness, because the nation's medical system is equipped to monitor only the 
most severe outbreaks, such as January's E. coli O157:H7 contamination. But 
even in these cases, no one really knows the extent of the problem because the 
most current statistics amount to guess work. In the E. coli outbreak, 
officials can only estimate that 600 or more people were affected. 
</P>
<P>
 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention places the number of all 
food-borne illnesses in this country at 6.5 million a year, with a 
corresponding 9,000 deaths. However, some high-ranking health officials say the 
CDC figure is only a fraction, as little as 1/10th, of the actual number of 
cases that occur. And knowledgeable sources say that virtually everyone in the 
country gets at least a mild case of food poisoning each year. The number of 
those most susceptible to food-borne illnesses -- or the list of potential 
victims -- is also increasing as Americans live longer and the percentage of 
the population at acute risk due to disease or infections increases. 
</P>
<P>
 What's frustrating is that the sources of food-borne illness are frequently 
foods that we take for granted and are a part of daily life -- not exotica. 
Besides ground meat, some of the recent vehicles of contamination include: hot 
dogs, chicken, eggs, oysters, fish, milk, cantaloupe, soft cheeses and 
delicatessen foods. And virtually any food can cause disease if improperly 
stored or prepared, or if handled by someone infected with, for example, 
hepatitis or shigellosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Other nations, with wildly different degrees of sanitation, are also playing a 
greater role in the American food supply, a trend that will continue with the 
advent of expanding free trade. Even today, for instance, a single hamburger 
patty may contain meat from hundreds of animals raised in different countries 
under varying degrees of regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite inadequate government regulation and an inattentive medical system, 
food industry representatives and their counterparts in government frequently 
claim that America has the safest food supply in the world. But the sweeping 
statement is rarely substantiated. Does the United States have fewer per capita 
food poisonings than Canada? Denmark? Norway? New Zealand? Japan? If officials 
don't know the extent of food-borne illness in this country, how can anyone 
correctly claim we have the safest food system in the world? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Congress frequently enters the debate, and over the years numerous bills have 
been introduced to improve food safety regulations. But the legislation often 
stalls over power struggles that pit those who represent agriculture and its 
many related interests against representatives of urban consumers.  
</P>
<P>
 And there is a lot of turf for Congress to battle over: 12 federal agencies 
with a total annual budget of $1 billion have at least some responsibility for 
regulating the nation's food supply, according to the Government Accounting 
Office, the investigative arm of Congress. The fractured jurisdictions have led 
to duplication of efforts, lack of inter-agency communication, wasted resources 
and questionable effectiveness, the GAO found. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration, under its "Reinventing Government" initiative, has 
proposed combining all the far-flung food safety programs into a single agency. 
</P>
<P>
 But such a proposal would require radical surgery: portions of the USDA, the 
FDA, the Commerce Department's National Marine Fisheries Service, the Federal 
Trade Commission, the Treasury Department's Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms, and others would have to be combined into a super food-safety agency. 
The plan has received lukewarm support in Congress, and it remains to be seen 
how such a dramatic reorganization could be forged. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, several major food safety issues remain pressing. Seafood 
</P>
<P>
 The regulation of seafood is one of the best examples of federal inefficiency 
in food safety oversight.  
</P>
<P>
 The USDA inspects virtually every cow, hog or chicken carcass that is 
slaughtered for human consumption. Inspectors are present each moment a 
slaughter plant or meat processing facility is in operation. Despite the 
intensive $500-million operation, the meat inspection program is riddled with 
problems. And the situation with seafood is even more uncertain. The FDA 
normally inspects seafood plants once every three to five years and is hampered 
by a limited annual budget of about $44 million for its Office of Seafood. The 
agency has attempted to increase the frequency of its visits but, at best, is 
inspecting fish and shellfish producers once a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere are the seafood industry's problems greater than with molluskan 
shellfish. A federal risk assessment study found that one out of every 1,000 
servings of raw oysters, clams or mussels causes illness, some fatal. For 
chicken, the risk assessment is about one illness for every 25,000 servings. 
The rate for all seafood, with raw molluskan shellfish included, is one illness 
per 250,000 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Effective this week, an ad hoc group of state, federal and industry officials 
known as the Interstate Shellfish Sanitation Conference will implement stricter 
regulations on the nation's shellfish plants. In preparation for the changes in 
1993, joint state and FDA reviews of 163 facilities found 43% of the plants had 
"critical" deficiencies. Beginning in 1994, any such problem would require 
closing the plant till corrective measures were taken. But penalties have 
little bite if inspections are infrequent or nonexistent, as they are at 
present. 
</P>
<P>
 Other shortcomings detected during the joint state-FDA review included 
discovery that one major producing state, Mississippi, did not adequately fund 
its required shellfish inspection efforts. And another state, Texas, did not 
prosecute those arrested for harvesting shellfish from illegal (contaminated) 
waters. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with the FDA's leadership vacuum and despite limited resources, 
California has been in the forefront of shellfish regulation. California was 
the first state to require retail outlets -- supermarkets and restaurants -- to 
provide warning labels or signs whenever Gulf of Mexico oysters are sold. The 
Gulf oysters have been linked to numerous cases of Vibrio vulnificus , a severe 
infection with a high fatality rate. Florida and Louisiana have also 
subsequently instituted some form of warning system for high-risk individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Selective warnings may not be enough. California's Health Services Department 
recently issued a report that said the risk from eating raw shellfish is so 
high, and can be so severe, that it is considering the unprecedented step of 
alerting the public that " All persons avoid the consumption of raw shellfish." 
(Emphasis theirs.) Such a statement, if forthcoming, would do incredible damage 
to the seafood industry and would be the first demonstration of an official 
lack of confidence in a popular food. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, shellfish interests are vulnerable: Earlier this year, a Northern 
California man received a $1 million settlement from five companies that took 
part in shipping Gulf oysters to the state. After consuming the shellfish raw, 
the man developed a severe Vibrio infection that resulted in $50,000 in 
hospital costs and permanent muscular, bone and tissue damage. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, Louisiana oysters shipped to 14 other states in November caused 
gastroenteritis -- diarrhea, vomiting, nausea, abdominal cramps and fever -- in 
at least 23 different settings and caused as many as 180 illnesses, according 
to the CDC. Because the oysters were identified as being from two different 
harvest beds -- Grand Pass and Cabbage Reef -- three states were able to recall 
the suspect shellfish. The FDA, on the other hand, only issued an advisory that 
consumers should not consume any oysters -- raw or cooked -- from the Grand 
Pass and Cabbage Reefs areas that were harvested before Nov. 16. But only 
supermarket or restaurant personnel would have access to tagging or labels that 
would identify the implicated oysters, and rarely is this information shared 
with the consumer. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the FDA does not have legal authority of its own to order recalls. 
The agency must persuade companies to voluntarily comply with requests to 
remove product, or it must secure a court order sanctioning a recall. Hot Dogs 
</P>
<P>
 In July, The Times commissioned laboratory tests to determine whether hot dogs 
were free of harmful bacteria. Twenty percent of the major brands analyzed 
where found to have Listeria monocytogenes , a pathogen that not only can cause 
flu-like symptoms but also serious illness in high-risk individuals, such as 
children and pregnant women. Hot dogs are classified by the federal government 
as a fully cooked product -- similar to ham, roast beef and salami -- and 
should be safe to eat right out of the package. Yet, the discovery of Listeria 
indicates a sanitation failure somewhere in the processing or packaging of the 
hot dogs. As a result, undercooking the contaminated hot dogs could cause 
illness. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of The Times findings, the USDA's Food Safety and Inspection 
Service, which operates the meat and poultry inspection program, analyzed hot 
dogs from four of the five plants that were responsible for the contaminated 
products. All samples taken by the USDA were found to be free of Listeria, 
according to a department spokeswoman in Washington. Subsequently, Food Safety 
and Inspection Service personnel returned to random monitoring for the presence 
of Listeria in cooked meats. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the fifth producer whose product contained Listeria in The Times 
testing -- Wilson Foods of Oklahoma City -- did not receive a special follow-up 
visit by the USDA. And just two weeks ago the company was required to recall 
40,000 pounds of its Wilson Jumbo Franks because the products were 
"undercooked," a condition that could lead to the growth of Listeria and other 
harmful organisms. 
</P>
<P>
 The Listeria risk extends to other fully cooked foods, particularly take-out 
items such as delicatessen meats, salads and entrees. Pesticide Residues 
</P>
<P>
 The definitive study on the controversy over pesticide residues was scheduled 
for release in 1993. Many thought the National Academy of Sciences' National 
Research Council report would settle the uncertainty surrounding possible 
harmful effects on children from pesticide residues. The anticipated public 
reaction was expected to prompt a call for extreme cutbacks in the use of 
pesticides; the Clinton administration even announced a plan to work toward 
pesticide reduction just before the findings were released.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet, when the long-awaited report, "Pesticides in the Diets of Infants and 
Children," appeared, it in essence called for more studies on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The strongest language the NRC used in the report wasn't very strong at all: 
"Although the data were weak, the committee estimated that for some children 
(farm chemical residues in food) could be sufficiently high to produce symptoms 
of acute organophosphate pesticide poisoning." 
</P>
<P>
 Produce industry representatives insist that the benefits of a diet high in 
fruits and vegetables far outweighs the theoretical risk from any pesticide 
residues in food, and that pesticide use is slightly subsiding. 
</P>
<P>
 But the National Agriculture Chemicals Assn. reported that there were $6.05 
billion in agriculture chemical sales in 1992, an increase of 5.6% over the 
previous year. Given the low rate of inflation, this increase likely indicates 
that more pesticides are being used in this country, not less.  
</P>
<P>
 Also during 1992, the FDA residue monitoring program discovered that 35% of 
the food sampled contained at least some pesticide residues, though illegal 
amounts were found on only about 1% of the domestically produced foods; the 
violation rate for imported foods was 3% of those items analyzed. Eggs 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, Salmonella enteritidis cases linked to eggs were clustered in the 
Northeastern United States. But since 1985, the incidents have appeared in 
other parts of the country as well. In the past seven years, the CDC reports 
15,162 confirmed cases of S. enteritidis , 1,734 hospitalizations and 53 
deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists believe the S. enteritidis is present in the yolk while the egg is 
still being formed in the hen's ovaduct. The contaminant is also believed to be 
isolated within a few major egg-producing flocks in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite almost a decade of scientific knowledge about the relationship between 
S. enteritidis and eggs, the federal government has yet to require egg 
manufacturers to place any kind of handling or cooking guidelines on egg 
cartons. The directions would parallel those for other raw animal foods, 
including the need for constant refrigeration. But to this day, a consumer can 
easily find supermarkets that display eggs at room temperature, an environment 
that would allow for the exponential growth of any harmful bacteria that may be 
present. 
</P>
<P>
 The CDC recently reported that at least three outbreaks of S. enteritidis 
linked to eggs occurred in California in 1993. In Los Angeles County, the 
source of the illnesses were egg-based dishes (omelets, scrambled eggs or egg 
salad) served at a single restaurant. Another episode, in San Diego County, was 
attributed to hollandaise sauce prepared with raw egg yolks by a restaurant. 
The third incident was home-made mayonnaise from raw eggs that was used on 
sandwiches. (Commercial mayonnaise includes only pasteurized eggs.) All the 
implicated eggs were traced to a single farm. 
</P>
<P>
 The CDC recommends that all hospital, nursing home and commercial kitchens use 
only pasteurized eggs products. Meat and Poultry 
</P>
<P>
 The year began and ended with questions about the credibility of the nation's 
meat and poultry inspection program. Critics contend that the "USDA Inspected" 
symbol on meats is little more than a cosmetic seal and does not address 
whether potentially harmful bacteria may be present. 
</P>
<P>
 The hamburger contamination scandal exposed several serious flaws in the 
USDA's meat inspection program. For instance, 50-year-old methods -- sight, 
smell and touch -- are being used by federal inspectors to determine the 
wholesomeness of meat and poultry. But the bacteria that was present in the 
tainted hamburgers -- E. coli 0157:H7 -- and other pathogens are detectable 
only through chemical analyses. 
</P>
<P>
 Two high-ranking USDA officials -- one a holdover from the Bush 
Administration, the other a new appointee -- have resigned, in part because of 
Clinton Administration dissatisfaction with progress in improving the Food 
Safety and Inspection Service's capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, USDA Secretary Mike Espy claims that more has been done to improve 
his department's food safety programs in the last 12 months than in the 
previous 12 years. The major accomplishments cited by Espy include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Increasing the number of federal meat inspectors by 200 to an inspection 
work force of 9,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Special, unannounced inspections of 90 meat plants, resulting in the 
temporary closure of 30 for sanitation violations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Appointing a special USDA liaison to work with the CDC on future E. coli 
0157:H7 outbreaks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Introducing safe handling and cooking instructions on raw meat and poultry 
packages. However, the proposal, the USDA's first attempt to mandate the 
labels, was blocked in court late last year. The department is now proceeding 
with a second regulation, which also may be challenged by food industry groups 
opposed to the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with all this activity, a review of Espy's first year in office by a 
coalition of consumer groups said the changes made by the new administration 
have not been substantive and placed part of the blame on institutional inertia 
and industry influence. 
</P>
<P>
 The Safe Food Coalition -- which includes Consumers Union, Public Voice for 
Food and Health Policy and the Center for Science in the Public Interest -- 
found fault with the USDA's inability to develop rapid tests for detection of 
harmful bacteria on carcasses, failure to get Congressional approval to require 
that all slaughter and processing plants maintain records on the carcass 
sources so that the origins of future contaminated meat shipments could be 
determined, and for not enforcing the USDA's own rule requiring that carcasses 
with fecal contamination be trimmed, condemned or converted into a fully cooked 
product. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, government officials and industry representatives are excoriated by 
consumer advocates for saying that the ultimate responsibility for food safety 
rests with the public. The statement seems to be an abdication of liability for 
producing a safe product. Whether this is fair public policy, given the amount 
of federal and state funds spent on food regulations, will be debated for years 
to come. But never has it been more true that consumers should be especially 
careful of what they eat. And we eat, the government estimates, 275 billion 
meals a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These are not foods that necessarily should be avoided. But health risks are 
frequently found in foods that are a part of everyday eating, and cautious 
consumers should be aware. See "What's Left for Dinner" below. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Pork: Trichinosis may still a problem; E. coli suspected in ground pork. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Parsley: Eighteen percent of samples tested by FDA showed illegal levels of 
pesticide residues. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Hamburger: Beef patties caused hundreds of illnesses in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Strawberries: Pesticide residues (though in allowable levels) found on 77% 
of samples tested by FDA. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Chicken: Between 66% and 100% of domestic raw product contains Salmonella 
bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Eggs: Raw and undercooked linked to nationwide outbreak of Salmonella 
enteritidis . 
</P>
<P>
 7. Fish: Government regulations are minimal. See story. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Raw Oysters: One out of every 1,000 servings causes illness. 
</P>
<P>
 9. Cut Cantaloupe: Bacteria on outer skin can contaminate flesh if left 
</P>
<P>
 unrefrigerated.

You put water (and optional flavorings) in a special trough, preheat the 
machine four minutes, put in the food and set the timer. No smoke, they say, 
and no accumulation of grease. If it sounds weird, at least it comes with an

AGAINST THE CRUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thank you for your story on the perfect carrot ("The Quest for the Perfect 
Carrot," Dec. 9). You hit a raw nerve. 
</P>
<P>
 I think it is tragic that this generation will never savor the true flavors of 
our many varied and wonderful vegetables. I am saddened too that our talented, 
dedicated chefs and food writers have succumbed to the fiction that a crunchy 
vegetable is good merely because of its consistency -- disregarding taste. 
</P>
<P>
 The fear of overcooking has replaced good judgment. A certain amount of time 
and vigilance is required for a vegetable to assume its own identity and not 
lose it -- neither celery nor mush. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps all is not lost. Your fine article gives one hope.

NEWS BITES : CORKS WITHOUT CORKINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the first major use of a closure other than natural corks for fine wine, 
St. Francis Winery in Sonoma County has begun using synthetic corks. The switch 
was aimed at eliminating the corky aroma that has plagued many wineries in the 
last few years.Wineries report between 2% and 4% of all bottles of wine are 
"corked." The undesirable aroma has been identified as a trace amount of a 
chemical called TCA-2-4-6, which appears to be a result of sterilizing natural 
corks with bleach. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Francis winemaker Tom Mackey conducted two years of tests on the synthetic 
cork material (Cellukork) for such problems as corkiness, leaks, pressure and 
flavor change. He says he found the Cellukork better in all respects. 
</P>
<P>
 Natural corks cost between 18 and 35 cents each, while Cellukork costs only 10 
or 11 cents, but Mackey says cost was not a major consideration. "The primary 
reason we went to this was corkiness," says Mackey. "Since we started using it, 
we haven't had one corked bottle. In fact, the wines I bottled last summer are 
almost too fresh. The Cellukork slowed down the bottle aging process, which 
makes the wine more durable in adverse conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 Mackey says the tighter seal may permit him to lower even further his use of 
sulfur dioxide in bottling: "There will be less air getting in, so we may not 
need as much sulfur as a protectant." DAN BERGER

WHAT'S LEFT FOR DINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL P. PUZO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U. S. Department of Agriculture, the Food and Drug Administration and the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have issued numerous recommendations 
for the general public on how to avoid food-borne bacteria. Several food 
industry groups have issued food safety guidelines as well. A combination of 
both government and industry recommendations follows. Each item may present 
different problems, but some rules apply to all foods. Several additional 
recommendations were added for high-risk groups. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 General Public Advisory: 
</P>
<P>
 * Select dairy products, raw meat, poultry, eggs and seafood last when grocery 
shopping. Go directly home after food shopping and store perishables in the 
refrigerator or freezer immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep raw foods and cooked foods separate when shopping and during 
refrigeration, preparation and cooking of foods. Otherwise bacteria that may be 
present in raw meat, poultry or seafood might contaminate a cooked or 
ready-to-eat food. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wash hands, knives and cutting boards in hot, soapy water before and after 
handling uncooked foods. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rinse raw meats, poultry and seafood with cold water before cooking to get 
rid of surface bacteria and other matter. 
</P>
<P>
 * If marinating a particular food, keep the dish stored in the refrigerator 
and never on the kitchen counter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rinse raw fruit and vegetables thoroughly with water before eating. Special 
attention should be paid to melons, such as cantaloupes, which should be 
refrigerated immediately after they are sliced and until serving. 
</P>
<P>
 * Thoroughly cook all food of animal origin, including eggs. Cook raw meat to 
an internal temperature of 160 degrees, raw poultry to 180 degrees and raw fish 
to 160 degrees or until it is white and flaky. Reheat leftovers thoroughly or 
until steaming hot. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep aprons, towels, cloths and sponges clean. Do not reuse dish clothes or 
sponges used to clean meat or poultry juices without washing. Replace sponges 
frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 * Read and follow food label instructions to "keep refrigerated" and "use by" 
code dates. 
</P>
<P>
 * Only thaw frozen food in the refrigerator or, if necessary, under cold 
running water. Do not thaw frozen food at room temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 * Only purchase raw eggs that have been refrigerated. Keep eggs under 
refrigeration throughout storage until ready to use. Keep raw eggs separate 
from cooked or ready-to-eat foods. Use eggs within 21 days of purchase. Do not 
use cracked or dirty eggs. Wash hands, counter surfaces and utensils with soap 
and hot water whenever they come in contact with raw eggs. Consume cooked egg 
dishes as soon as possible or refrigerate immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 * Purchase seafood that is well-iced or refrigerated and only from reputable 
commercial sources. Do not buy seafood from street vendors. Refrigerate seafood 
immediately after purchase and consume fresh seafood within a few days. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep hot foods hot, or above 140 degrees. Do not keep cooked foods at room 
temperature for longer than two hours. Harmful bacteria, such as Salmonella, 
Listeria, E. coli and other pathogens, thrive at room temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep cold foods cold, or below 40 degrees. Do not let cold foods stand at 
room temperature for more than two hours. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep the refrigerator clean and cold. Set to a temperature between 34 
degrees and 40 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Divide leftovers into small, shallow covered containers before refrigerating 
so that they chill rapidly and evenly. Refrigerate leftovers immediately after 
each meal. 
</P>
<P>
 * When grilling, use one plate to carry raw foods out to the grill and then a 
separate, clean plate for bringing cooked foods to the table. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the above precautions, persons considered to be at high risk 
for food-borne illness should: 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid raw or undercooked fish, shellfish, meat, poultry and eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid raw or unpasteurized milk. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reheat leftover foods or ready-to-eat foods such as hot dogs thoroughly 
until steaming hot before eating. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pregnant women and immuno-suppressed persons may choose to avoid foods from 
delicatessen counters or to thoroughly reheat cold cuts before eating. 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid soft cheeses such Mexican-style queso blanco , feta, Brie, Camembert 
and blue cheese. There is no need to avoid hard cheese, processed slices, 
cottage cheese or yogurt. DANIEL P. PUZO

THE YEAR OF EATING DANGEROUSLY ; COOKING IT SAFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many food dangers can be treated by the oldest sterilization process -- 
cooking. Some of our favorite foods, though, are raw or nearly so, and for 
perfect safety we may have to learn new ways of making them. It may be some 
consolation to cooks who already consider egg-based sauces like hollandaise 
troublesome that at least the dessert sauce zabaglione is safe because of the 
beaten-in sugar, liquor and oxygen, and the ease of keeping it over 140 degrees 
for three minutes or longer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sauces such as hollandaise and mayonnaise get their luscious texture from raw 
or barely cooked egg yolks. But how to make egg yolks absolutely safe?  
</P>
<P>
 In "The Curious Cook" (North Point Press: 1990), food science writer Harold 
McGee reported a successful method based on bringing the yolks (slightly 
diluted with water and lemon juice) close to the boil in a microwave oven and 
then letting them sit, covered, one minute.  
</P>
<P>
 Why the water and lemon juice? The water smoothes the consistency and the 
lemon juice hinders curdling. Why a microwave? Because it cooks rapidly and 
from all sides so you don't get the hot spots where curdling starts. And why 
should the yolks sit one minute? One minute at 180 degrees has been found to 
sterilize yolks even when infected with billions of salmonella bacteria. (This 
recipe errs on the safe side, bringing the yolks to about 200 degrees. 
Actually, any food is sterilized at 140 degrees -- if you hold it there for at 
least three minutes, which can be tricky with temperamental egg-based sauces.)  
</P>
<P>
 McGee stresses that you shouldn't add salt to the yolks before cooking, 
because it will make them curdle. And don't try making larger batches, or the 
whole egg mixture won't necessarily reach the proper temperature. And note that 
for the microwave cooking process you will need a minimum of two whisks or 
forks (three would make things easier), because if you use a fork or whisk with 
raw or only partly cooked yolk on it, it could contaminate the sterilized 
yolks.  
</P>
<P>
 STERILIZED EGG YOLKS 
</P>
<P>
 2 large egg yolks 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons water 
</P>
<P>
 Using fork or wire whisk, beat egg yolks until smooth in 2-cup glass measuring 
cup or 2-cup glass bowl. Add lemon juice and beat again. Add water and beat 
again. Place now-dirty fork or whisk in sink, or wash in hot soapy water. 
</P>
<P>
 Cover glass cup measure or bowl with plastic wrap or plate, place in microwave 
and cook on HIGH (100% power) until yolks begin to move. (Watch through oven 
window, standing back several feet; or after 30 seconds of cooking, open oven 
door at 10-second intervals to check.) When yolks begin to move, cook 8 to 10 
seconds longer and remove from oven. Beat yolks until smooth with clean fork or 
whisk. Place now-dirty fork or whisk in sink (use clean fork or whisk for next 
step because there will not be time to wash dirty fork). 
</P>
<P>
 Return yolks to microwave and heat on HIGH until yolks begin to heave again. 
Remove and beat vigorously with clean fork or whisk until smooth. Cover and let 
stand 1 minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Note : If using extra-large instead of large egg yolks, use 2 tablespoons plus 
2 teaspoons water.

 "Since near-boiled yolks have taken a beating before they ever see butter," 
writes McGee, "sauces made by this method are more fragile than the standard 
versions." When making hollandaise he advises 1) to start making the sauce when 
the yolks are still hot from sterilizing and 2) not to let the sauce get above 
120 degrees while cooking.

 Using clean whisk or fork, beat 1 to 2 slices butter and dash salt into 
still-hot Sterilized Egg Yolks. Scoop mixture into small saucepan over low 
heat. Add remaining butter slices and beat slowly just until melted into sauce. 
Strain. Adjust seasonings to taste with salt and lemon juice. Makes scant 1

 For a traditional European mayonnaise, at least some of the oil should be 
olive oil, but McGee suggests that olive oil make up no more than 1/4 of the 
total, or the mayonnaise will lose its consistency overnight. Extra-virgin 
olive oil, unfortunately, must be avoided. It appears to contain something that 
interferes with emulsification.

 Ground beef is no longer considered safe unless thoroughly cooked. So how do 
you make steak tartare? The safe way turns out to be the most traditional way 
-- buy a whole piece of meat and grind it yourself, which is also the way to 
get the best-tasting steak tartare. (If you want the traditional raw egg yolk, 
though, you'll have to compromise: See the recipe for sterilized egg yolks.) To 
be extra-safe, trim the surface of the meat before grinding. This recipe is 
from "The Way to Cook" by Julia Child (Alfred A. Knopf: 1989).  
</P>
<P>
 SAFE STEAK TARTARE 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 to 1 pound lean beef trimmed of all visible fat, preferably from first 
cuts of round (nearest rump) 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup minced red onion 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons Dijon mustard 
</P>
<P>
 4 anchovies 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup capers 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup chopped parsley 
</P>
<P>
 Sterilized Egg Yolks, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Worcestershire sauce 
</P>
<P>
 Prepared horseradish 
</P>
<P>
 Hot pepper sauce 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Few minutes before serving, remove beef from refrigerator and grind in 
well-washed grinder. Divide into 2 portions and mound 1 on serving plate. 
Around it place 2 tablespoons onion, 1 tablespoon mustard, 2 anchovies, 2 
tablespoons capers and 2 tablespoons parsley. Make indentation in mound and 
place 1/2 of Sterilized Egg Yolks in. Repeat with second portion of beef and 
garnishes. Pass with Worcestershire, horseradish, hot pepper sauce, salt and 
pepper. Makes 2 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 208 calories; 1,241 mg sodium; 85 mg cholesterol; 6 grams fat; 3 grams 
carbohydrates; 30 grams protein; 0.22 gram fiber. 
</P>
<P>
 Note: Though this follows precautions sufficient for most people, high-risk 
individuals -- such as children, pregnant women, or those with suppressed 
immune systems -- should avoid any raw meat, no matter how it is prepared.

 The classic Caesar salad dressing is made rich and creamy by the addition of 
barely cooked egg (traditionally boiled one minute). You can substitute whole, 
lightly beaten eggs cooked according to Harold McGee's technique for safe 
yolks, but the result tends to have a custardy flavor that changes the 
dressing. (McGee reports that the custardy effect is less noticeable when the 
dressing is well refrigerated, however.) As an alternative, here's Marion 
Cunningham's Caesar from "The Fannie Farmer Cookbook" (13th edition, 1990), 
which retains the basic flavor but is simpler to make and uses no egg at all.  
</P>
<P>
 SAFE CAESAR SALAD 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 2 to 3 cloves garlic 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 4 to 5 anchovy fillets 
</P>
<P>
 1 head romaine lettuce, leaves separated, rinsed and dried, wilted and 
blemished leaves discarded 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups croutons 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup Parmesan cheese, freshly grated or shredded into paper-thin bits 
</P>
<P>
 In blender or food processor, combine olive oil and garlic and process until 
smooth and creamy. Add lemon juice and dash of salt. Pour dressing into bottom 
of large salad bowl. Add anchovies and mash into dressing until well blended. 
Add romaine and toss together until leaves are coated and shiny. Add croutons 
and toss lightly to mix. Sprinkle cheese over just before serving. Makes 4 
servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 351 calories; 471 mg sodium; 10 mg cholesterol; 31 grams fat; 13 grams 
carbohydrates; 8 grams protein; 0.65 gram fiber.

BACK TO BASICS: SHUCK IF YOU MUST THIS OLD GRAY SHELL 
</P>

 There's some truth to the adage that oysters shouldn't be eaten in months with 
names lacking an "r" -- May, June, July and August. Although still edible, the 
bivalves spawn in summer and aren't nearly as plump or tasty. 
</P>
<P>
 A more serious concern, however, is the year-round possibility that these 
mollusks contain bacterial contamination. Like all shellfish, oysters filter 
food from their environment. Although many oysters are now raised on farms 
where water conditions can be closely monitored and certified as safe, the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta continue to warn people 
who have chronic illnesses such as liver or gastrointestinal diseases, those 
with AIDS, the elderly, children and pregnant women to eat only thoroughly 
cooked oysters (and other seafood). Generally, oysters from the Pacific 
Northwest are thought to be less troublesome than Gulf oysters, which spawn in 
warmer waters. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite knowledge of the hazard, many people savor the velvety texture and 
sweet yet slightly salty flavor of raw oysters enough to continue eating them 
straight out of the shell. You can lessen the risk by purchasing your bivalves 
from a reputable dealer. Ask when they arrived at the store and don't buy any 
that are more than two days old.  
</P>
<P>
 Oysters in the shell are typically sold by the dozen. They should be alive, so 
if any shells are partially open, check that they close quickly when sharply 
tapped. Allow six medium-size oysters per serving. When refrigerated in an open 
container that is covered with a moist cloth, oysters may be stored up to three 
days. Discard shells that open during storage and don't close quickly when 
tapped. 
</P>
<P>
 When oysters are well chilled, the muscles relax and oysters are easier to 
open. Before shucking, scrub the rough shells with a sturdy brush under cold 
running water. 
</P>
<P>
 An oyster knife (Step 1) is the best tool for opening the bivalves. Most have 
a guard between the handle and the short, strong blade (to protect your hand). 
</P>
<P>
 Although you may lose some of the natural liquid (the liquor), it's safer for 
novices to wear a heavy oven mitt and place oysters on a solid surface rather 
than holding them in hand while opening. 
</P>
<P>
 Oysters have one shallow and one deep shell. With the protected hand, hold 
each oyster so the deep side is downward. Insert the pointed end of the oyster 
knife between the shells near the hinge (Step 2), being careful the blade 
doesn't slip. 
</P>
<P>
 Twist the knife and push it into the opening, prying and lifting the upper 
shell enough to cut through the hinge muscle. Once the muscle is severed, run 
the knife blade the rest of the way around between the shells (Step 3), then 
remove the upper one. 
</P>
<P>
 Raw oysters may be tan, cream or gray, but the liquor should be clear, not 
cloudy, and smell sweet and pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
 Release the flesh from the bottom shell by sliding the knife blade underneath 
(Step 4). Examine each oyster with clean fingers to be certain there aren't any 
bits of shell still attached. 
</P>
<P>
 If sandy, rinse oysters with a minimum of cold water and strain the liquor 
through fine muslin. Return both to the shell and place on a bed of crushed 
ice. Serve with lemon wedges, pepper, horseradish and cocktail or hot pepper 
sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a knack to shucking oysters, so don't get discouraged if you find them 
difficult to open. If you find you just can't get them open, you can place 
oysters in a 400-degree oven for 5 to 7 minutes, depending on size, then drop 
them briefly in ice water -- they'll be easier to shuck, although the flavor 
will be altered. You can also microwave one or two at a time on HIGH (100%) 
power for about 10 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid bacterial danger, roast the scrubbed oysters in a large, shallow 
baking pan at 500 degrees for 12 to 15 minutes, until the shells open. Remove 
the upper shells by cutting the hinge. When properly cooked, the edges will 
curl and the oysters will plump and become opaque.

IT WAS A VERY GOOD MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Something unexpected happened to owners of Southern California wine shops in 
the second week of December: From Santa Barbara to San Diego, sales suddenly 
took off, with expensive reds and sparkling wines leading the way. Gift bottles 
sold better than in recent Christmas seasons, and some shops said they shipped 
wine around the country in greater volume than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden, on Dec. 10 it got crazy," says David Breitstein, owner of 
the Duke of Bourbon in Canoga Park. "By the 15th, we were having days like 
Christmas Eve every day." Normally, he says, there is a slow buildup following 
Thanksgiving, but this year the rush hit almost overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Store owners interviewed estimate that dollar sales of wine in December were 
up 15% to 30% from December of 1992, frequently reaching record levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Fredrikson, a San Francisco wine industry analyst and president of 
Gomberg, Fredrikson & Associates, notes that in December 1992, wholesale 
shipments were strong because retailers were stocking up to avoid price 
increases that took place in January 1993. No similar increase is scheduled for 
this year. "If December retail sales are as strong as we're hearing," he says, 
"that could mean we'll have a strong January too. A lot of people made good 
profits in the stock market, and in general people are happy. Interest rates 
are down, there is a feeling of well-being, and people are celebrating a bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Some store owners attribute the spurt to an upturn in the economy, others to 
homeowners having refinanced mortgages to lower house payments, and still 
others to medical studies that show a link between moderate consumption of red 
wine and lower risk of heart disease. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Others say the demise of a number of retail chains that once were a force in 
the wine trade has forced a consolidation of the retail market, providing the 
remaining stores with more buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Loutherback, owner of the Wine Club, says gross sales exceeded $1 million 
in December in each of his two stores -- Santa Ana and San Francisco. (Last 
December, Loutherback's San Francisco store had gross sales of $639,000; the 
Santa Ana store, believed to be the largest-grossing wine retail store in 
California, had gross sales of $891,000.) This year the two stores are nearing 
combined sales of $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Other merchants tell similar stories. Dick Williams, wine buyer for Gelson's, 
says wine sales in all 12 of his outlets were up about 15% in December compared 
to 1992. Carl Zytowski at the Wine Cask in Santa Barbara says his sales were up 
16%. John Lindsay, of Vintage Wines Limited in San Diego, estimates his sales 
were up 28%. And both Gary Fishman, wine buyer for Wally's on Westwood 
Boulevard, and Steve Zanotti of the Wine Exchange in Orange say sales at their 
shops were up 30%. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say interest in red wine rose because of the high quality of the 1990 and 
1991 California Cabernet Sauvignons after what some felt were two dismal 
vintages, 1988 and 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Dan Palmer, wine buyer for the Wine House in West Los Angeles: "We saw a 
lot of new faces this year, and they're buying a lot of Cabernet because the 
'90s and '91s are so good." He says Chardonnay remains the best-selling wine in 
the store, but, he reports, Champagne sales are "going nuts": "Last year we 
sold bottles, this year we're selling cases." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "People discovered Merlot this year," says Paul Smith, owner of Northridge 
Hills Wine and Spirits. "They hear about red wine being good for them, and they 
like the taste of Merlot. And in whites, people are finding their way gradually 
into premium wines. The customer who bought white Zinfandel two years ago is 
buying $10 to $12 Chardonnays now." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams says sales increases at Gelson's are similar. "It's been across the 
board, from Dom Perignon to Carlo Rossi's 3-liter Burgundy," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But as some owners have stated, a big reason for the dramatic sales at fine 
wine shops may be merely fewer outlets than in the past. "I think it has a lot 
to do with the compaction of competition," says Fishman of Wally's. "A year or 
two ago you had chains such as Liquor Barn, Vendome, Jurgenson's, Irvine Ranch. 
Most of them are gone now." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he says, some of the sales that once went to the now-defunct stores 
didn't go to fine wine shops but to discount warehouses such as Price Club and 
Costco. 
</P>
<P>
 Store owners said expensive wines such as Dom Perignon and Roederer Cristal, 
selling for $70 to $90 a bottle, sold as gift items. Some stores reported 
land-office business in high-end gift baskets that included not only wine but 
foods such as caviar, smoked salmon and cheeses. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, a lot of California wine was shipped to other states. Technically, 
California stores can ship wine only to the 12 states with which California has 
a reciprocal trade agreement, but most say that did little to slow things down. 
"I shipped a lot of wine to the Bible Belt this year," says Smith. He said 
large shipments of California wines went to buyers in Georgia, Arkansas, 
Mississippi and Kansas. Loutherback said he received orders from "just about 
every state in the country."

WINE: WINEMAKER OF THE YEAR: DARYL GROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Geyser Peak's Daryl Groom likes to say that grapes are 80% of a good wine and 
that the winemaker contributes only 20%. The remark is typically self-effacing 
for the jocular Australian, but considering what he by himself has accomplished 
for that Sonoma County winery in the past four years, it might be appropriate 
to reverse the figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Groom came to the winery, Geyser Peak's claim to fame rested on one 
achievement: Years earlier, it had pioneered a line of inexpensive table wines 
sold in boxes. But its bottled wine was dismal, lacking style and character. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, the wines were sound, but the winemaking was so conservative that many of 
the white wines had sorbates, a stabilizer added to lengthen shelf life. This 
made the wines smell a bit like bubble gum or cotton candy. Also, many of the 
white wines were made with residual sugar and not enough acid for balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Then fate, in the form of Groom, changed the winery into one of the best in 
California. For achieving what seemed impossible -- gaining Geyser Peak world 
fame in such a short period of time -- Groom is my choice for Winemaker of the 
Year for 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Groom came to Geyser Peak in an unusual way. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Businessman Henry Trione, who owned 1,200 acres of prime vineyard land in 
Sonoma County, bought sleepy Geyser Peak Winery in Geyserville from Stroh 
Brewing in 1982. (Stroh had obtained Geyser Peak in its acquisition of Schlitz 
Brewery and wanted out of the wine business.) 
</P>
<P>
 Trione saw that marketing the wine was a problem, and he began seeking a 
partner to assist him. In 1985, he got rid of the successful but image-damaging 
Summit bag-in-box wine line. Still, sales of the table wines lagged. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Trione sold half of Geyser Peak to the company that is now Penfolds 
Wine Group, the huge Australian operation that is itself a division of 
gargantuan South Australian Brewing Co. Penfolds was to provide marketing 
assistance to Geyser Peak. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at Penfolds soon realized that marketing would be difficult with 
wines of such dull quality and low reputation in the market. They decided the 
wines had to improve, but to provide guidance for the changes that would be 
made they didn't hire an American. They sent over Groom, one of Australia's top 
winemakers, a boy genius who by 30 was already chief winemaker for Penfolds' 
finest and most in-demand red wine, the famed Grange Hermitage. 
</P>
<P>
 Groom was fortunate in that Trione had provided him with state-of-the-art 
equipment, a winery that had the flexibility to adapt to techniques few in the 
United States knew much about, and more than 1,000 acres of vines in 
prestigious regions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even with all that going for him, Groom was at a disadvantage. Coming from a 
country thousands of miles away, Groom knew little about growing conditions in 
Sonoma County. And one of any winemaker's major problems is identifying which 
grapes make the best wine. As Groom says, "Ya gotta know the territory." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Groom wasn't coming from a backwater wine nation. The 
Australian wine industry is far more mature than the American. Wine was made 
commercially in Australia more than 50 years before it got started in the 
United States, and it didn't suffer the indignity of Prohibition, which most 
experts say set the American industry back another 25 years in terms of 
expertise, even though it lasted only 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Groom was, moreover, a graduate of Roseworthy College, which has one of the 
world's top winemaking programs. So he not only had an intuitive notion about 
growing regions and grape varieties, he was also skilled in the technical 
aspects of winemaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew the Triones had the grapes," he says. "The raw material was all here." 
But he admits that he was a bit awed by the challenge that faced him. He 
arrived in 1989, but was more observer than winemaker that year; his first true 
crush at Geyser Peak was 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 And now for the astounding news: Groom's first blended red wine, the 1990 
"Reserve Alexandre," won six gold medals at major wine competitions and was 
named best red wine at the 1993 Farmer's Fair of Riverside wine competition; 
his first Cabernet, the 1990 "Reserve," won the award as best red wine at the 
1993 International Wine and Spirits Competition at Ljubljana, Slovenia; his 
1990 Zinfandel won three gold medals and five silver medals.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The turnaround at Geyser Peak is now so complete that the newly released 1991 
Reserve Cabernet just went from $15 to $18, and this at a time when there is 
more fine Cabernet for sale than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Groom and his winemaking team -- fellow Aussie Mick Schroeter, Mike 
Draxton and cellar master Mike Vronoski Jr. -- have developed a stunning second 
label, Canyon Road Cellars. Priced in the $6 to $8 range, the wines are often 
discounted and thus represent great value. 
</P>
<P>
 Groom created the line by taking grapes grown in cool regions south of San 
Francisco and treating them carefully, as one would in making premium wine. The 
result is a growing line of wines that competes successfully for best value 
with anything in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, we're not doing it with mirrors," says Groom. "It's the grapes, man, 
the grapes." And with his infectious laugh, Groom dismisses any notion he had 
much to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Groom has employed a number of Australian techniques that have made news 
in winemaking circles, and he is not shy about sharing this information with 
fellow winemakers, which means that Groom has created an instant legacy that 
should help others as well as Geyser Peak. 
</P>
<P>
 Some years ago, when Geyser Peak was still making curious wines, pundits would 
refer to the winery as Geezer Puke. Thanks to Groom, that no longer happens. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What follows are tasting notes of Groom's wines (all are Geyser Peak except 
for Canyon Road where noted): 
</P>
<P>
 1991 Chardonnay ($10) -- Elegant citrus and toast aroma and a creamy, still 
fairly tart finish. This wine was aged on the lees in stainless-steel tanks to 
preserve freshness, yet has enough oak for those who like that soft, textured 
finish. Excellent value.  
</P>
<P>
 1992 Sauvignon Blanc ($7.50) -- Light herbal notes team with olives, pears and 
a hint of hay. The taste is lush and full from a trace of residual sugar, but 
it is distinctly Sauvignon in character. Excellent value. 
</P>
<P>
 1992 Semchard ($7.50) -- A blended wine in the Australian tradition, this 75% 
Semillon, 25% Chardonnay has a fresh fig, hay and pear aroma from the Semillon, 
but a creamy finish from the Chardonnay. A great value for those who like the 
latter grape but seek more interesting flavors. 
</P>
<P>
 1992 Gewurztraminer ($6) -- Applesauce and peaches with hints of many other 
fruits including lichee nuts and cardamom. A fascinating panoply of aromas and 
tastes in a wine that has plenty of residual sugar (2.5%) but also great 
acidity for balance. Great with very spicy Asian foods. A bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 1992 Soft Johannisberg Riesling ($6) -- Appears a tad sweeter than the 
previous wine, but its lower alcohol (9.8%) and apple-y aroma are perfectly 
Germanic and the wine is very easy to drink. 
</P>
<P>
 1990 "Reserve Alexandre" ($25) -- Powerful aroma of smoke and chocolate (from 
aging in new French oak barrels), but there is an intriguing note of black 
cherry and cedar here along with a trace of plums and red currants. Enticing, 
but still a bit hard. Needs a few years to smooth out. 
</P>
<P>
 1990 Cabernet Sauvignon "Reserve" ($18) -- Perfectly scented herbal notes 
along with cherry and cedar. The wine seemed a bit short on the palate when I 
first tasted it (almost a year ago), but recently it began showing hints of 
bottle bouquet. A truly tasty and cellar-worthy wine. 
</P>
<P>
 1992 Canyon Road Cellars Sauvignon Blanc ($5) -- A personal favorite because 
of its lovely juniper and pear aroma that reminds me of a fresh Graves with 
hints of Sancerre. The balance here is impeccable. If there is a fault, it's 
that the finish is a bit light, but then again, when you see the wine 
discounted to $4, you can overlook that little indiscretion.

</P>
<P>
 DEAR LORETTA: The carrots seem to be popular with many other readers. At 
Clifton's Cafeteria the fried carrots are served a la carte with a spoon on a 
bread plate -- and don't ask me why. CLIFTON'S FRIED CARROTS 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound large carrots  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Rinse and clean carrots. Cut in halves crosswise in about 3-inch lengths. 
Slice each half carrot lengthwise on slicing machine or with sharp knife into 
1/8-inch-thick slices. (Measure thickness with ruler as correct thickness is 
crucial to flavor.) 
</P>
<P>
 Combine buttermilk with cold water in mixing bowl. Combine flour and salt and 
pepper to taste in shallow dish. Combine crushed crackers in separate shallow 
dish, mixing well. 
</P>
<P>
 Dip each carrot piece into buttermilk mixture. Dip carrot into seasoned flour. 
Dip each piece once again into buttermilk mixture, making sure surface is 
completely wet. 
</P>
<P>
 Coat each piece of carrot with cracker crumb mixture, pressing lightly to coat 
each piece completely. Avoid caked-on appearance.  
</P>
<P>
 Place carrot pieces in fryer basket, being sure to avoid overcrowding. Drop 
basket into hot oil heated to 350 degrees and fry carrots until golden brown. 
Do not fry in advance and avoid stacking carrots before serving. Makes 4 
servings.

GOOD COOKING: RED SAUCE RISING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Few things are as basic as tomato sauce. Simple and straightforward, it 
affords many options: a sauce for pasta, rice, baked potatoes, meats, grilled 
vegetables or omelets. It's a base for a soup as well as a quick fix for 
sauteed or broiled seafood. It freezes well and can then be thawed in amounts 
that accommodate your needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Canned tomatoes work well in this sauce. Cut whole tomatoes crosswise and 
gently press out the seeds. It's a rather messy procedure, but one that is 
worth the effort. The tomatoes then can be coarsely chopped in the food 
processor, giving the sauce a homespun texture as it simmers slowly in an open 
pot, requiring very little attention. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 As simple as this tomato sauce appears, there was some experimenting before 
this recipe finally won out. I wanted a tomato sauce that tasted fresh with an 
interesting texture, adaptable to many uses. The sauce can be pureed after it 
has been cooked, if you prefer a smoother consistency. The food processor is 
handy for this, making fast work of mincing the garlic, onions, celery and 
carrots as well as coarsely chopping the drained, seeded tomatoes, something 
best done in small batches to better control the texture.  
</P>
<P>
 BASIC TOMATO SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 4 large cloves garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
 2 medium onions, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1 stalk celery, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium carrot, minced 
</P>
<P>
 2 (28-ounce) cans whole tomatoes 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup dry white wine 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons sugar 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons dried basil 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons dried oregano 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 Red pepper flakes 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in 4-quart non-aluminum pot over medium heat. Add garlic, onions, 
celery and carrot. Cook, uncovered, until onion is tender, about 6 minutes, 
stirring often. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, drain tomatoes, reserving liquid. Cut tomatoes crosswise and gently 
press out seeds. Chop tomatoes coarsely in processor batches. 
</P>
<P>
 Add tomatoes and liquid to pot. Add wine, sugar, basil, oregano, salt and red 
pepper flakes to taste. Simmer, uncovered, 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally. 
Can be made several days in advance and refrigerated or frozen as long as 3 
months. Makes 8 cups.

 Eggplant, long associated with massive quantities of oil, is seared in a non - 
stick pan with red onions and a minimal amount of oil. Although eggplant 
doesn't always require salting before cooking, it's insurance against any 
bitterness.  
</P>
<P>
 PAN-SEARED EGGPLANT AND RED ONION IN TOMATO SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium firm eggplant, peeled if desired, cut into 3/4-inch dice 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium red onion, cut into small dice 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups Basic Tomato Sauce 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 tablespoons julienned basil 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 pound dried pasta, boiled in salted water and drained, cooking water 
reserved 
</P>
<P>
 1 clove garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
 Grated Parmesan cheese 
</P>
<P>
 Put eggplant in colander. Toss with salt. Let stand in sink 1/2 hour, weighted 
down. Rinse thoroughly with cold water and drain on paper towels. Pat dry. 
</P>
<P>
 Heat oil in 12-inch non-stick skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and 
eggplant. Cook, uncovered, stirring only as vegetables look slightly charred, 
about 5 minutes. Add sauce and sugar. Adjust seasonings to taste. Stir in 
julienned basil. Can be made 3 days in advance and refrigerated, or frozen as 
long as 3 months.  
</P>
<P>
 To serve, toss hot cooked pasta with eggplant sauce, 1/4 cup of cooking liquid 
and minced garlic. Pass grated Parmesan cheese. Makes 3 servings.

 Here, the tomato sauce becomes a warm salsa, the perfect complement to 
Southwestern oven-fried chicken. A great low - fat - frying result is achieved 
with a zesty mustard and crumb coating. Skinless, boneless chicken breasts are 
used, but skinless thighs and legs can be substituted. SOUTHWESTERN OVEN-FRIED 
CHICKEN ON WARM TOMATO SALSA 
</P>
<P>
 2 large cloves garlic 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons vegetable oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/3 cups fresh fine white bread crumbs (about 3 slices) 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons cornmeal 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons chopped cilantro 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 teaspoon ground cumin 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons Dijon-style mustard 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 tablespoons water 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon honey 
</P>
<P>
 4 chicken breast halves, boned, skinned 
</P>
<P>
 Salt  
</P>
<P>
 Warm Tomato Salsa 
</P>
<P>
 In work bowl of food processor, combine garlic, oil, bread crumbs, cornmeal, 
cilantro, cumin, salt and cayenne pepper. Process to rough crumbs. Transfer 
crumbs to shallow pie plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine mustard, water and honey in another shallow pie plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Dip breasts one at a time in mustard mixture, coating evenly but not too 
heavily. Season lightly to taste with salt. Dip in crumb mixture, brushing away 
excess. Gently pat crumbs in place. Place breasts, rounded side up, on lightly 
greased jellyroll pan. Bake at 400 degrees until crisp and browned, about 25 
minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 To serve, swirl Warm Tomato Salsa on warm serving plates and place 1 cooked 
breast in center of each plate. Serve immediately with hot rice. Makes 4 
servings.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: BIG DIPPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Around 4 o'clock at Philippe the Original, the restaurant mostly emptied of 
the last of the lunch rush, a waitress stretches and yawns behind the 
stainless-steel service counter as if she'd just awakened. She counts out seven 
olives from a bin in the back, 5 cents apiece. She smacks a cardboard "Closed" 
sign in front of her station. Her shift ends in a minute, and she hums to 
herself as she slices big, asymmetrical slabs off the outside of a leg of lamb 
and lets a French roll soak in a bowl of salty pan drippings just a second or 
two longer than strictly necessary, but not long enough to soften the crisp 
edges of the slash in the roll's top. 
</P>
<P>
 She cuts the good American blue cheese thinly and sort of laminates it to the 
roll with a brisk twist of her knife. She is happy to be serving her last 
French dip sandwich of the day, and she seems to savor the wine order. 
</P>
<P>
 "Silver Oak," she says. "Silver is very lucky for the new year. It means you 
will make a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
 She walks over to the Cruvinet at the rear of the service area and measures 
out a healthy slug of wine. She smiles. "To a prosperous new year," she says.  
</P>
<P>
 It feels almost sybaritic at Philippe's in the late afternoon, sitting at a 
chest-high table in the main dining room, reading somebody's wrinkled old Metro 
section and crunching sawdust beneath your feet. The lamb sandwich is wet and 
rich, with something of the gamy animal pungency of old-fashioned roast meat; 
the Cabernet is a strong, deep-purple wine that tastes of blackberries and 
sharpened pencils and vanilla-scented new-oak barrels. All around the 
restaurant you can see nostrils flare when people hit a little depth charge of 
Philippe's hot mustard in their sandwiches -- some people daub it on kind of 
randomly, and I sometimes like to spread it on thickly as mortar. Time moves 
slowly here; it is a fine place to have lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Philippe's is so much a part of old Los Angeles that sometimes it feels as if 
it isn't a part of Los Angeles at all, as if it belongs to a city much older, 
much more attached to its distant past than this town, where historic 
preservation committees work to save old branches of McDonald's. A 1951 
newspaper column on the wall actually begs Philippe's not to mess the place up 
with chrome, which may have been the travertine marble of L.A.'s Golden Age. 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody who has lived in Los Angeles more than a year knows the story of 
Philippe's, how Philippe himself supposedly invented the French dip 60 years 
ago when he accidentally dropped a sandwich into some gravy, how the coffee 
still costs a dime (well, 9 cents plus a penny tax, though it was a nickel 
through the '70s and briefly rose to 11 cents last year) and how it is one of 
the very few places where cost-conscious county supervisors can still have 
expense-account meals.  
</P>
<P>
 There are fresh, crisp doughnuts for breakfast, and decent cinnamon rolls, and 
the standard bacon-and-eggs breakfasts you'll find at every hash house in the 
United States. Chili is house-made but tastes more like a spicy hamburger 
condiment than anything you'd want to crumble Saltines into for dinner; beef 
stew is a Depression-era lunch, full of meat and carrots and potatoes but a 
little short on flavor. Cream pies are beautifully sculpted, also a little 
over-laden with preservatives.  
</P>
<P>
 The menu board may no longer list dishes in alphabetical order, and I have yet 
to meet anyone who has ordered one of the pickled pig's feet that protrude 
scarily from their containers of brine. But though I am one of the few Philippe 
apostates -- I happen to believe that the French dip was "invented" at the 
slightly older Cole's P.E. Buffet at 6th and Main, which has not only a 
slightly tastier dipped sandwich but also Ritterbrau on tap -- I still find 
myself at the restaurant more often than I sometimes believe.

WHICH WINE WITH COLESLAW? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Usually, diners are not for winers. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, at Roscoe's Diner on Highway 17 in Upstate New York, you get a 
place mat that has a phrase (from Anthelme Brillat-Savarin), "A meal without 
wine is like a day without sunshine." 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, the only wine in the place is $3 a glass; it is dispensed from a bar 
hose, and when asked, the waitress said no one in the place knew what it was. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's Philippe, which is anything but your typical greasy spoon. As an 
aperitif (!) you may have a glass of 1992 Kunde Chardonnay at $3.75. With your 
beef sandwich you may have a glass of 1987 Carmenet Cabernet Sauvignon for 
$4.25 or a bottle of Jordan Cabernet at $24. 
</P>
<P>
 The amazing thing about the wine board, on the wall above the serving line, is 
the creativity of the dozen selections, which include 1991 Mondavi Fume Blanc 
at $12.50 and 1989 Silver Oak Cabernet at $32. Each is a whole bottle! All 12 
wines are available by the glass or bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 Bottle pricing here is just a few dollars above retail. Sure, you have to 
abide the indignity of Ord Street, the cheap stemware, the hard stools, and the 
din of the high-ceilinged gymnasium-like interior. 
</P>
<P>
 But with sandwiches this good, wine is a perfect accompaniment. Roscoe's could 
learn a thing or two.

<P>
 A dinner dance is always swell, but there's almost always a price to pay -- a 
hefty donation to some worthy charity. At last month's black-tie dinner dance 
hosted by the John Wayne Cancer Institute at Jimmy's in Beverly Hills, though, 
no one was hit up for a donation. Of course, each of the 250 guests, including 
all seven of John Wayne's children, former teen idol Frankie Avalon, producer 
Danny Arnold and actors Charles Bronson and Kevin Dobson, had contributed more 
than $1,000 during the year. It was the cancer institute's way of saying thank 
you to all its generous donors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dinner dance was strictly social," says Jimmy Murphy, owner of Jimmy's 
and a supporter of the cancer clinic (the event has been held at his restaurant 
for the past five years). "That's why people have a good time. They are not 
being tapped again." 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit John Wayne Cancer Institute, named after the late actor (he died 
of cancer in 1979), is one of the country's major cancer treatment and research 
centers. So far, more than $10 million has been raised for the clinic, now 
located at St. John's Hospital and Health Center in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy's parking lot was tented and then transformed into a winter wonderland . 
. . here in sunny Southern California. "With all these trees flocked and then 
these flakes coming out of this machine," says Murphy, who is from Ireland, "it 
looked like you were up on Gstaad or someplace in the Swiss mountains. There 
was even plenty of whiskey to keep everyone warm."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There was no stinting on the food, either. During cocktails, two large tables 
were heaped with imported cheeses, smoked salmon, steak tartare and other hors 
d'oeuvres. For dinner, guests were fed cold Maine lobster, chateaubriand with 
truffle sauce, baby greens and colcannon (a blend of mashed potatoes and 
cabbage). Floating islands with fresh raspberries was served for dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 "And then," says Murphy, "we danced it all off." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You don't have to be Irish to appreciate this soothing dish of mashed potatoes 
and cabbage. It can be served with eggs and sausage for breakfast, as a side 
dish for dinner, or even by itself as comfort food.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

chop more finely. 
</P>

RED PESTO: WHERE'S THE BASIL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This is a simple, light dish, perfect for entertaining. It takes less than an 
hour to make. 
</P>
<P>
 The spaghetti is topped with an untraditional pesto made with sun-dried 
tomatoes, salt-cured black olives, hot pepper flakes and a small amount of 
olive oil. It comes from Patricia Wells' new book, "Trattoria" (William 
Morrow). 
</P>
<P>
 With the pasta, you might serve a salad of mixed greens in balsamic dressing 
and a loaf of Italian bread. As an appetizer, serve bruschetta (grilled toasts, 
topped with slices of roasted sweet red peppers); sliced, peeled oranges 
accompanied by biscotti and cups of espresso could end the evening. SPAGHETTI 
WITH RED PESTO SAUCE 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons sea salt 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound dried Italian spaghetti 
</P>
<P>
 10 sun-dried tomatoes packed in oil and drained 
</P>
<P>
 1 large clove garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon crushed hot pepper flakes 
</P>
<P>
 6 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 20 salt-cured pitted black olives such as Italian Gaeta, French Nyons or 
Kalamata 
</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons minced fresh thyme leaves, or 2/3 teaspoon dried 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon minced fresh rosemary, or 1 teaspoon dried 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup flat-leaf parsley leaves, snipped with scissors 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup freshly grated Italian Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese, optional 
</P>
<P>
 Place 6 quarts water in large pan and bring to rolling boil over high heat. As 
water is heating, warm large serving bowl over pan. 
</P>
<P>
 At same time, process tomatoes, garlic, hot pepper flakes, olive oil, olives, 
thyme and rosemary in food processor until sauce is lightly emulsified but 
still quite coarse and almost chunky. Do not overprocess. (Sauce can be 
refrigerated in jar up to 1 month. If you do so, first cover pesto with film of 
olive oil. Drain off olive oil and heat before serving.) 
</P>
<P>
 When water is boiling, add salt and spaghetti, stirring to prevent pasta from 
sticking. Cook according to package directions until tender but firm to bite. 
Carefully drain pasta, leaving few drops water clinging so sauce will adhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Add pasta to warmed bowl. Toss with tomato-olive mixture. Add parsley and toss 
again. Transfer to warmed shallow bowls and pass cheese at table. Makes 6 
servings.

OLIVE: THE DUKE OF OILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVEN RAICHLEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In June of 1993, representatives of the major oil-producing nations convened 
at the Grand Hotel Quisiano on the island of Capri for a summit of industry 
titans. But their talk focused not on barrels and crude, but on HDLs and 
cold-pressing. These particular oil producers belonged not to OPEC, but to IOOC 
-- the International Olive Oil Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The product that brought them here has become a primary fuel of the 
nutritional and culinary revolution of the 1990s: "green gold," better known as 
olive oil. 
</P>
<P>
 When I was growing up, olive oil was difficult to come by, and the choice was 
limited to one or two producers. Today's consumer is confronted with a 
staggering selection of olive oils: extra-virgin or virgin, Italian or Greek, 
cold-pressed or stone-ground, even oils with vintages, like wines. 
</P>
<P>
 According to industry consultant Hank Orsi, olive oil imports have soared 
3,000% in the last 10 years to their current annual level of 100,000 tons. In 
an age of general lackluster economic performance, olive oil sales were up a 
hefty 11.5% in the last 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 So what accounts for olive oil's astonishing success today? Three factors have 
conspired to turn olive oil into a cook's indispensable companion: lifestyle, 
health and taste. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 First, lifestyle. In the 1980s, American food-lovers began turning from the 
elaborate sauces and cooking methods of French cuisine to a simpler style based 
on grilling. Olive oil, with its rich fruity flavor, proved to be perfect for 
marinating and basting. It required little more than opening a bottle and 
pouring. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, medical researchers turned their attention to the diet of 
the Mediterranean, a region with a surprisingly low rate of heart disease and a 
high consumption of olive oil. Not as rich in monounsaturated fats as canola 
oil, but very rich nonetheless, olive oil contains little saturated fat, an 
item that health professionals tell us to eat less of. Because it is a useful 
source of Vitamin E, researchers have studied olive oil for a host of health 
benefits -- from lowering blood pressure to reducing the risk of arterial 
thrombosis. 
</P>
<P>
 But equally important is olive oil's pungent and distinctive flavor. Only a 
few food oils are used as a flavoring, among them olive oil, nut oils and 
sesame oil. Olive oil possesses an almost limitless range of flavors: It can be 
fruity or earthy; intense or mild; grassy, herbaceous, or even peppery. 
</P>
<P>
 Many factors determine the taste of a particular oil: the type of olive (more 
than 60 varieties are used for oil making), the ripeness of the fruit at 
harvest time, the harvesting method (the best oils are made with hand-picked 
olives), and the methods of pressing, blending, aging and bottling. Like wine, 
olive oil reflects the soil, slope and microclimate where the trees are grown. 
There's no such thing as a "best" oil -- no more so than there's a "best" wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, there are some technical details you should know before plunking 
down as much as $30 for a quart of olive oil. First are the three basic grades 
of olive oil: "Extra-Virgin," "Virgin" and "Olive Oil." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Extra-Virgin, the highest grade, contains 1% or less acidity. Virgin oil 
(seldom seen in this country) contains between 1% and 3% acidity and is chiefly 
used for blending. Plain "olive oil" (once called "pure" oil) starts as 
inferior oil that, because it's too acidic or poorly flavored, can't be sold in 
its natural state. The oil is industrially refined to reduce its acidity to 
1.5% or less, then flavored with a little extra-virgin or virgin oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Other terms to consider when buying olive oil include "stone-ground" or 
"cold-pressed" -- an indication that the olives have been crushed with a 
traditional millstone, not in a machine. (Mechanical presses heat the oil, 
which alters the flavor.) 
</P>
<P>
 "First press" refers to oil from the first oil extraction. (The crushed pulp 
can be pressed a second time to make an inferior grade of oil.) "Unfiltered" 
oil contains fine particles of olive solids, which gather at the bottom of the 
bottle, like sediment in fine old wine. 
</P>
<P>
 To enjoy olive oil at its best, you should buy extra-virgin. It won't be cheap 
(plan on spending at least $8 to $15 a quart), but thanks to its intense 
flavor, a little goes a long way. What you'll get is a quality oil made from 
first-choice olives, pressed immediately after harvest in a press that keeps 
heat to a minimum. Extra-virgin olive oil is distinguished by a bright (often 
greenish) color, fragrant aroma and deep, rich, fruity flavor. The flavor 
varies dramatically from oil to oil, from producer to producer and from country 
to country, but it will always be intense. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of my favorites include Frescobaldi "Laudemio" and Badia a Coltibuono 
from Italy, James Plagniol and Old Monk from France, L'Estornell Certified 
Organic from Spain, and Olio Santo from the Napa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Colavita makes a good, affordable, all-purpose extra-virgin oil for everyday 
use. Some of the best values are the strong, fragrant oils from Portugal and 
Greece. Available at ethnic markets, they cost a fraction of what Italian oils 
do and often have more flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One final note: Unlike wine, olive oil does not improve with age. Store it 
away from heat and light in an airtight container and use it as soon as you 
can. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bagna cauda, literally "hot bath," is an ancient, olive - oil-based dip from 
northern Italy. The following recipe has been adapted from Lotte Mendelsohn's 
book, "Italian Regional Cookery" (Font & Center).  
</P>
<P>
 BAGNA CAUDA 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup extra-virgin olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 6 to 8 cloves garlic, thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
 1 ounce flat anchovies, drained, rinsed and chopped 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 Dash red pepper flakes 
</P>
<P>
 2 carrots 
</P>
<P>
 2 zucchini 
</P>
<P>
 2 stalks celery 
</P>
<P>
 1 sweet red pepper 
</P>
<P>
 4 green onions 
</P>
<P>
 8 grissini (slender Italian bread sticks) 
</P>
<P>
 Gently heat olive oil in heavy saucepan. Add garlic and cook over medium-low 
heat until garlic is light-golden brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in anchovies and 
cook 1 minute. Let mixture cool slightly, then puree in blender. Season to 
taste with black pepper and red pepper flakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Place oil mixture in small chafing dish or fondue pot and keep warm over low 
heat. Or mixture can be reheated and placed in 4 individual ramekins. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut carrots, zucchini, celery and sweet red pepper into strips 1/2x3 inches. 
Cut green onions into 3-inch lengths. Arrange vegetables and grissini on 
platter or stand upright in glasses or cups. Let each diner dip vegetable 
strips and bread sticks in oil mixture. Makes 4 servings.

 This fresh cranberry fruit ice makes a spectacular dessert with no fat. It's a 
delicious way to start the new year.The ice may be prepared a few days in 
advance. If you don't have an ice cream freezer, pour the cranberry mixture 
into a glass loaf dish and freeze, stirring several times during the process of 
freezing. Be sure to cover tightly with foil after the final stirring. Allow 
the ice to stand at room temperature about 15 minutes before serving for ease 
in spooning it out. Also, more flavor comes out when the ice warms a bit.

GARDEN FRESH; THE SQUASH TRIBE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIA THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If any provender from the garden symbolizes joyous abundance and abandon, it's 
winter squashes. Growing, their vines clamber cross country, rollicking over 
(and up and over) everything in their path. Ripening, their voluptuous fruits 
gleam green, gold, yellow, orange, ivory, blue and red amid thickets of bold 
dark leaves. The colors can take the shapes of rounds, drums, teardrops, 
schmoos (from "Li'l Abner," remember?) acorns and blimpy bananas and pears -- 
their figures fluted or smooth. Sizes of winter's squashes can range from 
peaches to Cinderella's coach. 
</P>
<P>
 And what's the difference between summer and winter squash? Just time. Summer 
squashes are immature fruits, ready to eat within six or seven weeks of sowing. 
Winter squashes have ripened, usually taking three to four months to do it, and 
aren't ready to eat until late autumn or winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, some strains of squashes have proven to be tastier at one 
stage or another. But that's not to say you can't eat your squashes any time 
you please. 
</P>
<P>
 Cucurbita, the squash tribe, consists of several families. Four of them 
produce winter squashes. It's important to know the pluses and minuses of each 
clan when ordering seeds. And it's rewarding to know what you're seeing at the 
market -- you no longer have to settle for tried and true banana squash. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * C. maxima: Generally the sweetest, least fibrous, best-keeping and largest 
winter squash. Some will store a year or more, and their quality will hold. 
Enormous rumpled hubbards (some gauzy blue), flavorful buttercups with belly 
buttons, big zucchini-shaped bananas, exotic turbans and matte-shelled kabochas 
that look like Japanese rice wine pots are C. maximas. I'm partial to the 
scarlet-orange, teardrop-shaped Red Kuri and thick, dark orange, ultra-smooth 
Chestnut. 
</P>
<P>
 The coach-sized pumpkins are also maximas (yes, pumpkins are winter squashes). 
Big Max regularly weighs in at 100 pounds, and its golden flesh makes good 
pies. There are pumpkins I heard about that weigh 600 pounds or more -- 
suitable for Reubenesque Cinderellas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * C. pepo: Here are the rest of the glorious pumpkins. Large, rosy-red Rouge 
Vif D'Etampes, generously round, flattish and deeply gathered, a pumpkin out of 
a French fairy-tale -- and magical in the garden. A small sugar pumpkin, on the 
other hand, is Yankee plainsong, perhaps the finest for pies. Trick or Treat 
has lots of "naked" seeds -- with no hulls, for carefree nibbling. The deeply 
lobed acorn squashes with their buttery orange flesh, the zany spaghettis, the 
diminutive green-and-ivory striped Delicatas (long) and Sweet Dumplings (round) 
are also C. pepos.  
</P>
<P>
 Usually C. pepo squashes must be eaten within a month or two of harvest. After 
that, their quality declines. But pepos are the fastest-maturing squashes -- 
best choices for areas with short seasons. (Incidentally, all the summer 
squashes are pepos.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * C. moschata: Here are the long, pear-shaped, buff-colored butternuts. 
They're not the handsomest of the tribe on the outside, but inside they have a 
small seed cavity and lightly sweet flesh that cooks to lustrous orange. 
Butternuts are among the longest-keeping winter squashes and they grow easily. 
Waltham Butternut is tops. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 * C. mixta: Little grown except for Green-Striped Cushaw, shaped like a 
crooknecked butternut, pale-green mottled with dark-green. The flesh is coarser 
and less sweet than other winter squashes, but good for baking. Popular in the 
South because Cushaw's vines are vigorous and among the most drought-tolerant. 
</P>
<P>
 Having set their winter squashes in a cool, dark, dry, airy place in autumn, 
prudent gardeners everywhere are now bringing them into the kitchen. A splendid 
feeling. I once kept an enormous blue Hopi winter squash in our entry hall for 
a year, rather than in the cellar. I felt rich every time I looked at it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like so many plants, squashes are easy to grow if they have what they need: 
Full sun and moist, well-drained soil, stuffed with organic matter -- the 
happiest squashes I've seen were volunteers on the compost pile.  
</P>
<P>
 Wait to sow seeds until the soil is warm. I set squashes three feet apart at 
the edge of the border so they can amble over the grass or along the railroad 
ties or down the slope and nobody's bothered. Each is beautiful in its own 
luxuriant way. 
</P>
<P>
 When the days turn warm, mulch deeply with compost. Spray once a month with 
mild kelp solution. 
</P>
<P>
 No room for gallivanting vines in your garden? Grow a squash in lightweight 
potting mix in a five- to six-gallon container two feet deep. Burpee offers 
shorter-vined varieties: bushkin pumpkin, butterbush butternut and bush acorn. 
Keep the soil mix moist but not wet, and feed every two weeks at half-strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrol for bugs and eggs on and under the leaves (protect with insect-weight 
floating row covers from the beginning if your area has problems). Harvest 
winter squashes before danger of frost, when the stalks begin to shrivel, the 
shell is no longer shiny but dull and can't be pierced with a thumbnail. The 
best squashes are those that seem heavy for their size. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond mere beauty to the eye, winter squashes give exceptional sustenance. 
They're full of beta carotene (which, curiously, increases in storage), Vitamin 
A, Vitamin C and potassium. And this good eating comes with remarkably few 
calories. 
</P>
<P>
 All winter squashes are superb baked au naturel. Even when the flesh isn't 
exposed to oven heat, roasting intensifies the sweetness and best preserves 
beta carotene. To me, the most pleasing way to eat winter squash is to pierce a 
whole acorn or Delicata or Sweet Dumpling or Baby Bear pumpkin with a long, 
sharp fork, slip the squash on a pie dish into the oven, bake at around 400 
degrees until tender, about 45 minutes, take it out, slice in half, scoop out 
the seeds and strings, sprinkle over nutmeg and brown sugar to taste, then sit 
down and dive in with a spoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Bigger squashes must be sliced in pieces before baking. Use a strong, sharp 
knife or cleaver and concentrate. A rubber mallet helps. Bake the pieces face 
up, occasionally brushing with butter or a nut oil. The temperature is the 
same, but the time depends on thickness -- anywhere from 15 minutes to 40 
minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, when a recipe calls for peeled winter squash, choose a variety 
with a smooth skin. Peeling a fluted acorn squash, no matter what technique you 
use, is maddening. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a shame that using cooked halves of winter squashes as serving bowls has 
been done to death. Squash seeds will never go out of style, though. Toast 
seeds in an oiled pie dish at 325 degrees, stirring occasionally, until crisp, 
20 minutes to 30 minutes.  
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, we've just finished a supper of my mother's delightful winter squash 
curry. It's snowing outside, but the bright orange sauce mantling white rice -- 
with bits of apples, radishes, green onions, tomatoes, coconut, raisins, 
peanuts, peppers, cucumbers and cilantro tumbling down the slope -- makes it 
seem as though the sun is shining on our plates. 
</P>
<P>
 Winter squashes, now that I think of it, should be called summer squashes. 
Their glow is a slice of summer.

 My mother is not a purist but an artist, and hers is an inventive curry. So in 
preparing it, I'm not a purist either. Usually I don't consider using 
out-of-season vegetables, but the more colors in this composition, the merrier. 
So if you see an appealing this and that at the market that wouldn't flatten 
your purse, add them to the heap. The sauce may be prepared a day in advance, 
and the condiments (except for the apples) a couple of hours before serving. We 
like beer or jasmine tea with curry. Serve with lots of steamed white rice and 
the condiments surrounding so people may add what they'd like. For dessert, why 
not pick up some baklava at a Mediterranean deli? GLORIA'S WINTER SQUASH CURRY 
</P>
<P>
 4 1/2 pounds butternut or other bright-fleshed winter squash 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons butter 
</P>

minutes, stirring pieces occasionally. Process to smooth puree in food 
processor, 2 cups at time. 
</P>
<P>
 In top of large double boiler or heavy saucepan over flame tamer, melt butter. 
Blend in curry powder. Whisk over medium heat, about 1 minute. Blend in squash 
and heat over hot water or stir over medium heat occasionally so sauce won't 
burn, 15 to 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 When hot, thin to consistency of thick cream sauce by slowly whisking in 
broth. Season to taste with salt. Adjust seasonings to taste. 
</P>
<P>
 Serve green onions, radishes, green or red peppers, cucumbers, tomatoes, diced 
red apples, dark raisins, shredded coconut, peanuts and cilantro as condiments 
to add as desired. Makes 8 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Note: When chopping green onions and radishes, include tender leaves. Include 
seeds with peppers.

GREAT HOME COOKS; FRESH (AND LIGHT) FROM BOMBAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 During a three-month stay in Southern California, Parvathy Sathyamurthy cooked 
just as she would at home in Bombay. Supermarkets supplied almost everything 
she needed, and special ingredients such as urad dal (lentils) and fenugreek 
seeds were readily available in Artesia's little India neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Sathyamurthy was here to see her daughter and son-in-law, Janaky and Hariharan 
B. Iyer of La Habra, and their daughter Easha, 2 1/2. They're all vegetarians 
with deep roots in South India, and they follow ancestral traditions closely. 
</P>
<P>
 During Sathyamurthy's visit, the Iyers ate exceptionally well. She's an ardent 
cook, known in Bombay for her magic touch, which friends even "borrow" on 
occasion. That happens when they make idli , steamed cakes prepared from a 
fermented rice-and-lentil batter. Idli batter is notoriously slow rising -- 
except in Sathyamurthy's hands. So those less gifted ask her to touch their 
batter, figuring her magic will work for them. 
</P>
<P>
 During her visit, she was even able to make the strong, flavorful coffee for 
which South India is famous. Coffee beans grown in that region generally get 
the credit for the deep, rich flavor. However, Sathyamurthy produced a worthy 
facsimile using an American brand of coffee and an Indian filter pot. 
</P>
<P>
 After the water dripped through, forming a strong coffee extract, she added 
hot milk and sugar, then poured the mixture back and forth to mix it well and 
make it foamy. In India, coffee makers show off by pouring the brew in an 
impressively long stream. Instead of a cup, it's served in a stainless-steel 
tumbler with a companion bowl that holds the overflow. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 To honor a visitor, Sathyamurthy prepared not only coffee but a full meal. 
This she arranged on a table near the corner that serves as a family shrine. 
The shrine is filled with pictures and images of deities, and the family prays 
there mornings and evenings. Sathyamurthy had sprinkled white powder onto the 
top of a cabinet in the form of the Hindu elephant god Ganpati (Ganesha). Such 
a design is called a kolam, and in South India, large, elaborate kolams are 
traced with great care on the ground outside doorways. 
</P>
<P>
 Sathyamurthy had prepared two North Indian dishes, because she grew up in 
Bihar, in the north of India. The other dishes were southern, reflecting her 
family's origins in the South Indian state of Kerala. Her husband, an 
advertising consultant, is also from Kerala. 
</P>
<P>
 The northern dishes were sabzi panch mahal (a Punjabi mixed vegetable curry) 
and masala bath , spiced rice dotted with vegetables. Southern foods were upma 
(a nourishing mixture of roasted cream of wheat, vegetables and nuts) and a 
strong, spicy apple chutney that would amaze Westerners accustomed to sweet 
fruit chutneys. Sathyamurthy had no trouble here finding the apples she uses in 
India -- Granny Smiths.  
</P>
<P>
 For dessert, she made payasam , a milky sweet that is typically served at 
South Indian celebrations. Payasam is often made with vermicelli, but 
Sathyamurthy produced a version based on shredded carrots. Long, patient 
simmering and stirring enrich the flavor of this soupy dish. 
</P>
<P>
 Sathyamurthy's cooking would surprise Americans who think of Indian food as 
heavily spiced and dominated by powerful sauces. Her dishes are light and 
fresh, and it's no wonder her home in Chembur, a suburb of Bombay, attracts a 
steady stream of guests. CREAM OF WHEAT WITH MIXED VEGETABLES (Upma)

ONLY IN L.A.

 L.A.'s biographer doesn't live here anymore: We're referring to John Weaver, 
the author of "Los Angeles: The Enormous Village" and of the Encyclopaedia 
Britannica's essay on the city. Weaver grew so upset with the graffiti that he 
moved to Durham, N.C., five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he has resettled in the warmer climes of Las Vegas. "This makes it easier 
to visit L.A., which I love to do," Weaver said. "I just don't want to live 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 When he went to the Nevada Department of Motor Vehicles recently to turn in 
his North Carolina license plates, he found a long line of other newcomers. "I 
was practically the only one who didn't have California plates," Weaver said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Is he also a friend of Simon Garfunkel?In its review of 1993, L.A.'s Downtown 
News lists, among the year's winners, "Maguire Thomas Partners co-founder 
Robert F. Maguire III, who had the Central Library's . . . gardens named after 
him." Among the losers it includes "Maguire Thomas Partners co-founder James 
Thomas, who, thus far, has nothing important named after him." 
</P>
<P>
 We hope this void is soon filled. (Perhaps ex-Mayor Bradley could give Thomas 
one of his designations . ) The seriousness of the founders' identity crisis 
became clear last year when L.A. City Councilman Nate Holden mentioned his 
feelings about the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have anything against Maguire Thomas," Holden explained. "He's a 
friend of mine. I've known him for 20 years."

 Triple leap year: That's 1994, judging from the calendar put out by the

 Wanted -- Ex-Dead People: Here at the clearinghouse for erroneous documents, 
ads and signs, we received a phone call from a Fox TV producer who is searching 
for people once mistakenly believed to be deceased. It's for a talk show 
segment called "I'm Not Dead." 
</P>
<P>
 We couldn't help out producer Glenn Meehan, except to nominate Jerry Mathers 
of TV's "Leave It to Beaver." You may recall that a widespread rumor of the 
1960s had Mathers being killed in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried him," Meehan said sadly. "But his people wanted too much money to 
have him appear." 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like the Beav's getting advice from Eddie Haskell again.

SCOTT HARRIS: GETTING THE FACTS STRAIGHT IN DENNY CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles jury decided that smashing Reginald Denny's skull with a brick 
did not constitute assault with a deadly weapon . . . -- Columnist George Will 
in NewsweekDec. 17, 1993 Outrageous, isn't it? You saw the video. You saw 
Damian Williams heave the brick that smashed Reginald Denny's skull. You saw 
Williams' victory dance. And now the estimable George Will, reviewing 1993 with 
a deadpan delivery of facts and observations, reminds us that an infamous jury 
amazingly found Williams innocent of assault with a deadly weapon. Incredible! 
</P>
<P>
 But before getting mad all over again, remember you shouldn't believe 
everything you read. George Will didn't get his facts straight. 
</P>
<P>
 His mistake is a common one and, no doubt, an honest one. Will's column, 
titled "1993: Nature's Hysterics, and More," unintentionally reveals how Will 
and others angered by the Williams verdict aren't immune from hysterics 
themselves. Will's error is hereby offered as evidence that 1993, for all its 
tribulations, really wasn't as bad as you thought. 
</P>
<P>
 George, pay attention: The Williams jury did not decide that smashing Denny's 
skull with a brick wasn't assault with a deadly weapon -- or ADW, as the cops 
call it. The jury decided that Williams' felonious assault, horrible as it was, 
did not constitute either attempted murder or aggravated mayhem (maiming). The 
jury found him guilty of the lesser felony of mayhem, as well as four 
misdemeanor counts of assault. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference is huge, legally and journalistically. 
</P>
<P>
 As every cop and prosecutor in California knows, ADW, in and of itself, isn't 
a big-time felony. The maximum prison term is four years. By contrast, the max 
for attempted murder or aggravated mayhem is life imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams wasn't charged with ADW in the Denny beating, prosecutors explain, 
because his crime was far more serious. Under sentencing rules, a charge of ADW 
would have been pointless. As it was, the much-maligned jury convicted Williams 
of crimes that resulted in a 10-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 This may seem like nit-picking -- that it's easy to confuse ADW with attempted 
murder. Moreover, in the attacks on four other individuals, the jury indeed 
acquitted Williams of ADW in favor of misdemeanor assaults. 
</P>
<P>
 But Will's carelessness will perpetuate the myth that this jury had no basis 
for its ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 As his error illustrates, knee-jerk cynicism was a favorite pastime after the 
Denny verdict. Critics who found the Williams verdict too lenient cite it as a 
prime example of how racial politics and fear have perverted American society. 
But you can find fault with race relations and the justice system without 
resorting to misinformation. 
</P>
<P>
 Another example is a clever but inaccurate political cartoon by Randy Wicks of 
the Newhall Signal that depicts three "Assault Weapons in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 The word "mean" appears above the image of a bloody knife. "Meaner" appears 
above a smoking gun. Above the bloody brick is the punch line: "Misdemeanor." 
</P>
<P>
 It's wry enough to have been reproduced on T-shirts. But the fact remains that 
Williams' brick was implicated in a felony. 
</P>
<P>
 Cartoonists practice parody, so perhaps Wicks can be excused. Will's intent is 
serious. Substitute the term attempted murder for assault with a deadly weapon 
and the statement isn't so mind-boggling. After all, intent is very hard to 
prove. 
</P>
<P>
 Inaccurate though they may be, Wicks' cartoon and Will's column accurately 
reflected the general mood. Expectations of a stiffer verdict left people 
muttering that Williams was "getting off." Long before Will's column appeared, 
I talked with three people who also confused ADW with attempted murder. Two 
were white, one was black. All were outraged that Williams didn't get hammered 
with the maximum penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 In the recent travails of L.A., the ironies multiplied. The videotape of the 
Rodney G. King beating created an international furor -- yet it persuaded the 
first jury that the police officers' actions were reasonable. The video of the 
Denny beating, however sickening, persuaded 12 citizens that there was a 
reasonable doubt whether Williams intended to kill his victim. If that was his 
intent, why didn't Williams continue his violent attack rather than do his 
nasty jig? The evidence, they concluded, supported the lower mayhem charge. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also ironic that the good Samaritans who saved Denny's life saved 
Williams' bacon. Had they not arrived, Williams likely would have faced a 
murder charge -- a point prosecutors are fond of making. 
</P>
<P>
 Denny's survival hurt the case against Williams. When Denny hugged Williams' 
mother in court, his gesture may have put the jury in a more lenient frame of 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 So if 1993 left a bitter taste, don't forget the forgiving embrace of Reginald 
O. Denny. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the image of a smirking Damian Monroe Williams keeps coming to mind, 
try to picture that smirk behind bars.

ELAINE KENNEDY, ANAHEIM ARTIST, DIES OF STROKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Elaine Kennedy, an artist who had lived in Anaheim for many years, died Sunday 
of a stroke. She was 54. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy was vacationing in Temecula with her husband, Don, when she was 
stricken on the golf course on Dec. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Active in the now-defunct Torana Art League as well as the Southern California 
Women's Caucus for Art, Kennedy was a painter of vibrant landscapes. She died 
just two days before the opening of her one-woman show, "The River Still 
Flows," at the Theatre Arts Gallery, Concordia University in Irvine. A private 
memorial has been planned for the opening reception Friday night. The 
university is at 1530 Concordia. The show will continue through Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 A breast cancer survivor, Kennedy had "the ability of making people feel she 
knew them forever," a friend said. In addition to her husband, she leaves two 
children, Colleen Premer of Costa Mesa and Craig Kennedy of Huntington Beach, 
and three sisters and two brothers, all of Canada.

A CLOSED DOOR OPENS FOR CONSUMERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Too often civil court settlements that may negatively affect consumers have 
been kept confidential. But despite some continuing opposition, this practice, 
fortunately, is changing. 
</P>
<P>
 New rules explicitly discouraging sealed settlement agreements took effect 
Jan. 1 in Los Angeles Superior Court. Similar rules were also adopted by the 
San Francisco, Santa Clara and San Diego superior courts. Four courts don't 
sound like much, but together they account for almost half of state civil court 
filings. 
</P>
<P>
 Courts have acted on their own to protect the public interest because 
statewide legislative efforts have failed. A bill did pass in 1992 to limit 
agreements between tort litigants aimed at preventing public disclosure of 
evidence of product defects, environmental hazards or fraud. Defendants in such 
suits frequently require that evidence of defect dangers be sealed as a 
condition of settlement -- plaintiffs must agree or forfeit compensation for 
their injuries. But Gov. Pete Wilson, concerned that it could hurt businesses, 
vetoed the bill that would have reformed this practice.  
</P>
<P>
 Trial court judges wisely understand that a policy of secrecy is often not in 
the public interest, especially when it precludes warning consumers about 
foreseeable dangers that can cause injuries. The L.A. court rules are 
reasonable, and contain procedural safeguards to prevent the inappropriate 
release of business secrets. These differing court rules are all good, but they 
underscore the continuing need for a uniform state standard.

SPECIAL COUNSEL -- NOT QUITE YET; JUSTICE DEPT. SHOULD DO ITS JOB AND PROBE 
WHITEWATER THOROUGHLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What the political system needs, what the American people deserve and what the 
integrity of the presidency requires in the so-called Whitewater case is simply 
this: a spotless, above-reproach probe. The point is to get to the bottom of 
the allegations, which President and Mrs. Clinton insist are baseless, and, if 
possible, move on. 
</P>
<P>
 But to drag one's feet, as some in the White House have appeared to do, or to 
overly politicize the issue, as some who are insisting on a special prosecutor 
are doing, are both recipes for creating another crippled presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations are that Clinton once used his influence as Arkansas' governor 
to help a friend and co-investor who was in regulatory hot water over his 
savings and loan, which eventually went belly up. The allegations concerned 
events that occurred in the mid-1980s. These events were tied to the Clinton 
presidency following the suicide last spring of White House adviser Vincent 
Foster. After Foster's death, White House aides removed files from his office 
concerning the Whitewater matter. Those files are yet to be made available to 
designated Justice Department prosecutors. The White House promised Wednesday 
that it will comply with a grand jury subpoena demanding the documents by Jan. 
18. 
</P>
<P>
 That's exactly what must happen, for further delay will give the calls for a 
special prosecutor a life of their own. In fact, a probe of the sort led by 
special prosecutors in earlier cases is not an option, at least unless and 
until the House passes a Senate bill approved in November that would restore 
authority for a panel of judge to select a special prosecutor in any case that 
requires one. 
</P>
<P>
 Until that is done, however, all that Atty. Gen. Janet Reno can do other than 
what she has done -- order a department probe and promise that it won't be a 
joke -- is to name some lawyers not working for the Justice Department to head 
up an investigation outside the department's walls. But would that necessarily 
prove superior to a departmental probe? We think not, and in fact there is a 
good chance that delay outside the department would be worse than any delay 
within it. Inside the department, Reno's feet no less than Clinton's will be 
held to the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be a mistake to let Reno off the hook. Let the outspoken and 
apparently independent-minded attorney general do her job and have the Justice 
Department, whose taxpayer-supported budget runs into the billions, demonstrate 
that it is apolitical by delivering findings that are incontrovertible. And 
that must proceed without further delay not only because with each day the 
White House's apparent foot-dragging looks suspicious; there is also a 
technical reason. These allegations are so old that, though prosecutors have 
some time left to pursue criminal leads, the statutory clock on some of the 
possible charges winds down as early as March 2.

MEXICO: NOT EVERY UPRISING IS A REVOLUTION; SALINAS MUST EMPHASIZE NEGOTIATION, 
NOT REPRESSION, IN CHIAPAS REVOLT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mexico is a nation with a population of more than 92 million, the 
third-largest in the Western Hemisphere, and with a strong economy poised for a 
major leap forward under the North American Free Trade Agreement. As the 
rebellion rages through Chiapas, the nation's southernmost province, it is 
crucial that the size and character of Mexico as a whole be borne in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 SENSE OF PROPORTION: Why? Because only then can the enormous difference 
between the Chiapas uprising and guerrilla movements, superficially so similar, 
in Guatemala, Nicaragua and El Salvador be appreciated. The legitimate 
grievances of the rebels in those three countries aside, their rebellions were 
vastly more threatening because the countries in which they occurred were 
geographically and demographically so much smaller than Mexico. El Salvador has 
a population of 5.6 million. Its capital, San Salvador, can be and has been 
threatened by guerrilla uprisings in its border provinces; its land area is so 
small that no province is ever very far from the capital. Mexico's capital, the 
largest city on the planet, is not the city it was when Emiliano Zapata 
occupied it 80 years ago. Only a major invasion could threaten it today. 
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, the relative restraint that official Mexico showed in its initial 
response to the violence unleashed by the Zapatista Army of National Liberation 
in Chiapas is a restraint that the country easily could afford. The stock 
market has almost certainly overreacted: Mexico as a whole is simply not 
threatened by this provincial rebellion. For that very reason, we can only 
deplore Wednesday's gratuitous strafing and aerial bombing of civilians in the 
area. Mexico can and should abhor any tactic that criminalizes the population 
as a whole. The vast majority of the indigenous people of this province are and 
should be treated as innocent bystanders. Protecting them is ultimately more 
important than capturing the last guerrilla. 
</P>
<P>
 The path back to peace can only be the path of negotiation; and we applaud 
President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's declared willingness to negotiate. The 
shadowy Zapatista leadership has shown no such willingness, and one reason may 
be its wish to remain shadowy. Salinas and his administration will rightly seek 
to learn with whom they are dealing. But they should not bar any good-faith 
participant from the meeting table, certainly not someone like Bishop Samuel 
Ruiz of San Cristobal de las Casas. Ruiz is not in good odor with the 
administration, but peace will not be restored without a bold gesture or two. 
And though this uprising is on its face a domestic disturbance, the involvement 
of Guatemalan refugees, perhaps of Guatemalan-trained or -supplied guerrilla 
leaders and certainly of a cross-border, international drug trade may dictate a 
later broadening of the discussion to include Guatemalans as well. 
</P>
<P>
 THE OUTSIDER QUESTION: As Alan Weisman shows in an article that will appear in 
next Sunday's Los Angeles Times Magazine, the abuse of peasants by 
international drug lords is not a problem that affects Chiapas and the Lacandon 
Indian peoples only. Comparable abuses affect the Tarahumara people in the 
province of Chihuahua. Indigenous peoples are, in fact, victimized by the drug 
trade in many remote, tropical areas around the world. Their problems cannot be 
considered in isolation. 
</P>
<P>
 Official Mexico may have been unwise to deny the existence of the Zapatista 
guerrilla movement for so long. NAFTA would most likely not have been 
jeopardized by timelier candor, for the abuse of the Indians and of the poor in 
Chiapas, grievous as it may be, is far from definitive of the Mexican economic 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Containment of this rebellion should be easy. Full suppression of it may be 
impossible. To seek the latter would be to widen a conflict that no one wants 
widened. Mexicans remember, far better than Americans do, what violent 
revolution can be in the life of a nation. Mexico badly needs a vigorous, 
multi-party political system; but to say that is to call for reform, not for 
revolution.

 * In response to "When Languages Collide" (Dec. 19): When my parents and I 
moved to California from Oklahoma in 1949, I started third grade at La Cienega 
Elementary School. Besides the 3Rs, we were also taught California history -- 
with emphasis on the Spanish/Mexican heritage of the area.Along with the 
Hispanic history, we were also introduced to the Spanish language (and the 
student body was 95% white). At the end of the fourth grade, the school play 
was staged entirely in Spanish, with English translation for the parents.  
</P>
<P>
 The point is that in the late 1940s and early '50s, Los Angeles city schools 
taught white kids Spanish, and Mexican and Chicano kids English as a regular 
part of our education about California's multinational and multicultural past 
and present, and I think it worked great. It wasn't called "bilingual 
education" or any other special name. Kids (we didn't call each other that 
then; we were just "Mike" and "Jose") weren't separated or taught any 
differently from each other; we learned together about our respective 
histories, cultures and languages.

<P>
 * In response to "Taming the Monster: Get Rid of the Guns," Dec. 28: As stated 
by this editorial, the whole answer to our nation's crime and homicide problem 
is to get rid of guns. Personally, I think it is absurd. 
</P>
<P>
 Look at just this past year; how many random shooting sprees there have been 
-- from San Francisco to just recently in New York, where a gunman opened fire 
on innocent civilians. If just one of our many law-abiding citizens was 
concealing a weapon, the massacres could have ended before they started. 
</P>
<P>
 If responsible, educated, law-abiding gun owners give up their guns, no doubt 
their chance of becoming a statistic will increase dramatically.

 * We strongly support your stand on gun control. suggest that you take an 
additional step: Call for repeal of the anachronistic Second Amendment to the 
Constitution. Rather than go through the already well-researched and rehearsed 
reasons supporting repeal, we will content ourselves with noting that the 
Second Amendment can well be likened to the vermiform appendix in the human 
body. Both appendixes, human and political, while having served useful 
functions in the evolutionary and political past, now serve only as centers of 
danger and inflammation.

 * You ask the question: Who could be against such measures as mandatory 
waiting periods, heavy taxes and limits on ammunition and restrictions on 
certain types of guns? I could! I am a law-abiding citizen who happens to enjoy 
shooting sports. Your editorial position continues to miss the point: Your 
virtually total ban on guns will only affect people like me and will not reduce 
violent crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The only guns turned in under a total ban on private gun ownership will be by 
citizens like myself. The criminals who use guns to ply their trade will not be 
handing in theirs. The federal government has done a miserable job of 
controlling drug traffic (drugs are still the major cause of gang-related 
violence -- hint, hint). How can they enforce a ban on guns carried by 
criminals? 
</P>
<P>
 MICHAEL E. SMITH

 * Your editorial does not go far enough. The government should immediately 
prohibit the sale of all handgun and assault weapon ammunition. This would 
prohibit the importation of these goods, and the manufacturing of them in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 This would greatly shorten the "shelf life" of those weapons which are 
currently in the hands of those who use them to break the law, as well as those 
which cause accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Second Amendment clearly qualifies the right to bear arms as it relates to 
the security of a free state, and a well-regulated militia. 
</P>
<P>
 What the National Rifle Assn. has promoted has resulted in a non-regulated 
anarchy which threatens not only the security of our free states, but the 
militias (police) of those free states as well. 
</P>
<P>
 When the constitutional rights of the few who own ammunition plants meet 
head-on with the former rights of the many thousands killed by the bullets they 
make, is there any question as to whose rights should be curtailed until a 
better solution is found?

 * I feel that you avoid the problem. Your proposal deals with those who seek 
to buy guns legally. The problem does not lie with law-abiding citizens, though 
they do account for a minute portion of gun-related deaths. The problem lies 
with the underground -- the criminal element. What needs to be done is 
enactment of tougher laws on gun dealers and also on those caught with guns 
that were illegally obtained. There are many different opposing arguments to 
gun control, one of the most important being the constitutional defense. But it 
primarily comes down to whether or not we, as a people, are going to allow 
ourselves to be armed against those who choose to violate our property, our 
family, our society, and fundamentally, our freedom.

 Finally Russia, the "evil empire," accepts the futility of an arms race with 
the U.S. and we can't handle it. We start our own, as too many paranoid 
Americans rush to buy more guns under the guise of protection. Can't they 
understand that if the money used to buy these guns was donated to law 
enforcement professionals it would go a long way toward solving escalating 
crime tragedies?

DISPOSING OF NUCLEAR WASTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your Ward Valley editorial ("Unnecessary Alliance Confuses the Issue," Dec. 
27) seeking to differentiate biomedical low-level radioactive waste (LLRW) from 
nuclear power plant LLRW reflects a basic lack of scientific understanding of 
this issue. 
</P>
<P>
 As you used my quotation to mistakenly support your viewpoint, I would 
appreciate the opportunity for a response. 
</P>
<P>
 If the medical community felt that aboveground, temporary waste-holding 
facilities were all that the biomedical LLRW generators needed, we would have 
opted for this solution when anti-nuclear power groups began blocking Ward 
Valley. The fact is, the biomedical community produces the full spectrum of 
LLRW, from short-lived, relatively benign waste that may be decayed to 
harmlessness in a short time to long-lived radioactive waste that needs burial 
for 500 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all radionuclides used in medicine come from nuclear reactors. These 
reactors produce the same types of LLRW as nuclear power reactors. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept of separating biomedical waste from nuclear power plant waste, 
aside from being illegal and scientifically foolish, has a more ominous aspect 
-- it is a ruse. Citizens who know we need a LLRW site for important biomedical 
LLRW are being told that this "good" LLRW will be taken care of separately. 
They are then free to oppose Ward Valley because they will "only" damage 
nuclear power. Wrong. The truth is that the biomedical community and the other 
non-nuclear power plant LLRW producers, over 2,000 of us, need Ward Valley as 
licensed, and this fantasy of a temporary, aboveground holding facility will 
not solve our problem and will never exist. 
</P>
<P>
 Your editorial mentioned that some biomedical institutions are building 
temporary, aboveground holding facilities and reducing their LLRW production to 
zero. Wrong. They are decaying out some of the radionuclides with half-lives up 
to 90 days in these facilities, but the truth is that large quantities of LLRW 
are being dumped into the sewer after dilution to meet sewage disposal limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Have we made radioactive waste "disappear"? Of course not. We have substituted 
the careful containment of undiluted LLRW in well-managed LLRW sites for a thin 
smear of radioactive material covering the country. No one knows how much there 
is or whether it will cause problems for us or for future generations. Is 
"flush and forget" the sensible alternative to Ward Valley? That's up to all of 
us, isn't it?

COLUMN LEFT/ ALEXANDER COCKBURN: AMERICA, LAND OF LORDS AND PEASANTS; THE 
MIDDLE, WORKING CLASS IS ENSLAVED, WITH NOT THE SOP OF LEFT-WING SYMPATHY.

<P>
By ALEXANDER COCKBURN, Alexander Cockburn writes for the Nation and other

 Here are some of the big stories the press has missed over the past decade: 
Between 1965 and 1985, slavery was successfully reintroduced into the United 
States. In 1960, one college graduate with a C average could earn enough to buy 
a house with three bedrooms, garage, basement and attic; raise four kids and 
own a 2-year-old Chevy. Today it takes two childless wage slaves to afford the 
rent on a one-bedroom apartment. The upper classes have succeeded in enslaving 
the middle and lower classes. Job and working conditions are terrible, with the 
basic freedoms to speak, to assemble and to be free from unreasonable search 
denied working people. 
</P>
<P>
 America is the world's leading candidate for land reform. Most of the land in 
the United States was acquired by theft. This is why the basic rule is that 
nobody can take your land so long as you stole it fair and square. To commence 
land reform, the tens of millions of acres the railroads stole should be 
repossessed because the owners have violated the terms under which they 
acquired them. 
</P>
<P>
 The "taking" issue is really a "giving" problem. Much noise is generated by 
the radical right over the government's propensity to take private property for 
the public domain without "fair" compensation. This masks the real problem, 
which is of course the giving problem, wherein windfall land-value increases 
are created by government actions -- roads, sewer lines, light rail, rezoning 
and so on. The people should share the incidental fruits of public investment. 
There is a third dimension to this issue: the revolutionary idea that people 
who own land should put something back for the value they withdraw. We could 
finance the cost of takings by taxing the windfalls from givings. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate planning and systems analysis are utter failures. Virtually nothing 
of worth to the country has come out of corporate planning. It merely serves as 
a tool to increase concentration, commodification or domestication. Of course 
people should think ahead and have dreams and be logical and systematic, but 
things that have been worthwhile to humans have been produced organically, 
through incremental development and inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nation is not a left-wing magazine. There is barely any left-wing press in 
the United States. If there were, it would be dealing with problems such as the 
above. The two political parties are just two arms of the business party; the 
press and media are its creatures, too. There was more left-wing analysis in a 
single issue of Mad Magazine in the mid-1950s than in the combined output of 
all left-wing publications in this country in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Our society refuses to disgorge engrossers. The central problem of our time 
was a central one for medieval theologians: how to control the lust for 
self-enrichment. From the Middle Ages to the Reformation, the unpardonable sin 
was of the speculator or middleman who snatched private gain by the 
exploitation of public necessities. The term for such people was engrosser -- 
literally, one who buys up a market wholesale to monopolize higher prices. This 
crime was considered grounds for excommunication by the Catholic Church, and 
the remedy for such activity was "disgorgement." It was also a civil crime for 
which the third repeat offense was "pillory and ruin." The first laws against 
engrossment were passed around 1025 and the last were not repealed until 1844. 
</P>
<P>
 For almost 800 years, the economic behavior that creates the problems that 
environmentalists now so politely oppose were generally considered illegal and, 
even more important, sinful. But now religious institutions that once monitored 
engrossers have disappeared as a force for social equity, and the two-party 
system has devolved into a single Chamber of Commerce party. While 
environmentalists thinly fill the vacuum, serious and organized opposition to 
engrossers has mysteriously disappeared without public notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Today we seem to be on our way back to a lord-peasant social structure, which 
would be more tolerable if the upper classes followed the ground rules for such 
societies. But today's upper classes, while eager to assert traditional 
medieval rights of lords (such as that the upper class holds all the assets and 
peasants must not encroach on those above them) shrink from the lord's 
traditional obligations: Peasants are a lord's responsibility in sickness and 
old age -- you can't work a peasant till he drops -- and the basic rule of 
medieval societies: Lords must not despoil peasants.

 The other day, as I was making a hurried purchase in a stationery store, a 
voice behind me said, "I hate that stupid parade." The experience got me 
thinking.I'd always kept my aversion to New Year's, Pasadena-style, fairly 
secret. But maybe there are more Tournament of Roses Grinches out there. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, now we can let out a big sign of relief that we can go to the gas 
station again. Sure, there's trash around, port-a-pottys still line the streets 
and chain-link fences show up in unexpected places. At least all those 
"friends" we haven't heard from in umpity years have finally left. 
</P>
<P>
 Those of us who have watched many years' worth of parades know that the parade 
theme may change from "Arctic Adventure" to "Jungle Joy" to "Space 
Shenanigans," but the floats stay exactly the same: a jungle temple scene with 
a Buddha statue in front, a float with a couple of biplanes on it, one with 
rosy-faced little kids playing, the requisite dinosaur and the boat float. 
Boring!

weeks before the next Tournament of Torture.

MORNING BRIEFING: FINALLY, THE OBJECTIVE VIEW OF THE NATIONAL CHAMPIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hit the road, Florida State. One newspaper has declared Nebraska the new 
national football champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't take 'Noles for an answer," the Bellevue, Neb., Leader said in a 
front-page headline Wednesday. "Leader declares Cornhuskers No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
 In an editorial, the weekly newspaper in an Omaha suburb said it made the 
declaration to preserve "a shred of dignity, an ounce of self-respect or a 
milligram of manhood." 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska lost the national championship to Florida State after losing to the 
Seminoles, 18-16, in the Orange Bowl on New Year's Day. National polls put 
Florida State No. 1 and Nebraska No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Add Nebraska: The Bellevue Leader also criticized national sportswriters. 
</P>
<P>
 "For too long, we as a football-loving people have schmoozed the nation's 
sportswriters, granting them the power to magically transform their subjective 
opinions into revealed truth. How they vote is how it has been. We declare our 
independence from hack writers, know-it-all sports pooh-bahs. . . . Don't worry 
about the scoreboard. The national writers never do." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: John Elway is second in career passing yardage in the Pacific 10. 
Who is No. 1? 
</P>
<P>
 Confident leader: The Raiders' Al Davis, in conversation with San Francisco 
Examiner columnist Art Spander, had this to say of the upcoming NFL playoff 
game against the Denver Broncos on Sunday in the Coliseum: "They're scared to 
death of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Sparring partners: New England Patriot Coach Bill Parcells chips in with his 
perspective on the Buddy Ryan incident. "I've had a few coaches I'd like to 
punch myself," Parcells said. "And I'm certain there were a few that would have 
liked to punch me." 
</P>
<P>
 Futility Bowl: UCLA, with six turnovers against Wisconsin in the Rose Bowl, 
didn't come close to being football's No. 1 bowl team in self-destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas A&M had seven interceptions and five lost fumbles in the Cotton Bowl on 
Jan. 1, 1942 -- a day the Aggies held Alabama to one first down and 75 total 
yards -- and lost, 29-21. 
</P>
<P>
 Reward for failure: Bob Scott, who led Manchester, England's failed bids to 
land the 1996 and 2000 Olympic Games, was awarded knighthood in the Queen's New 
Year's Honors list for his efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Changing times: When a group of potential Indianapolis 500 drivers showed up 
for a rookie test recently, their names were John Brooks, Andrea Chiesa, 
Bertrand Gachot, Stephan Gregoire, Olivier Grouillard, Mauricio Gugelmin, David 
Kudrave, Andrea Montermini, Scott Sharp and Johnny Unser. Racing historian 
Chris Economaki pointed out, rather wistfully, that there was "nary a sprint or 
midget (driver) and only four claim English as their native tongue." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Erik Wilhelm of Oregon State, with 9,393 yards to Elway's 9,349 
while at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Boston Celtic Coach Chris Ford, discussing the psychological 
condition of his struggling team: "If we were any more passive, we'd be in a 
coffin." SHAV GLICK

LAKERS GET DOUBLE DOSE OF BAD NEWS; PRO BASKETBALL: BOWIE HAS KNEE SURGERY, 
THEN L.A. LOSES TO KINGS TO FALL BACK INTO LAST PLACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Lakers lost a key reserve and a game Wednesday, falling to the Sacramento 
Kings, 106-98, at Arco Arena hours after learning they will be without Sam 
Bowie for at least six weeks because of arthroscopic knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Both were significant setbacks. The Lakers were coming off an emotional 
one-point victory the night before at Denver, and the two previous games were 
close losses to San Antonio and Seattle. Then this, which knocked them back 
into last place in the Pacific Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because this was the third game of a road trip and the way they (the Kings) 
had been playing, I thought it would be a real tough game for us," Laker Coach 
Randy Pfund said. "It was just another example of a team that can't find 
consistency night after night." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of Bowie hurts in several areas because he had become such an 
integral part of the rotation while backing up Vlade Divac at center and Elden 
Campbell at power forward. He was third on the team in rebounding despite 
averaging only 22 minutes, an especially big loss considering the Lakers were 
already last in the league in that category. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, it is a challenge," Divac said after collecting a game-high 19 
rebounds against the Kings. "Before the season, my goal was to average 10 or 11 
rebounds. I'm trying to get more now, especially on offense." 
</P>
<P>
 To replace Bowie, who went on the injured list, Kurt Rambis was signed to his 
third stint with the Lakers and second this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowie has a well-chronicled history of injuries, once playing only 25 games 
over a stretch of three seasons because of leg problems. However, he went a 
long way toward shaking that reputation the last two seasons with New Jersey. 
In 1992-93, he missed only three games and two of those were because of a mild 
stomach ailment. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the Dec. 21 game at Orlando, Bowie had never faced a knee problem. That 
night, though he can't pinpoint when the injury occurred, he started feeling 
pain around the fourth quarter, then it worsened afterward. He hasn't played or 
practiced since. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors originally diagnosed it as a sprain, but more extensive tests later 
found bone chips. Bowie at first declined the inevitable surgery, hoping to 
wait until the summer, but when he failed to respond to therapy and left the 
Lakers on their three-game trip, he returned to Los Angeles and changed his 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's 45-minute procedure removed the chips, which can be a common 
wear-and-tear knee problem among many players. How soon he returns depends on 
the recovery, including degree of swelling. Orlando Woolridge missed about 
three months when he had a similar procedure as a Laker. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is another giant asterisk as to how we are going to win games if we 
don't have anybody to rebound for us," Pfund said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rambis, who played the first five games of the season before going on the 
injured list with tendinitis in his left knee, was cut Dec. 14, two days before 
he would have received a $250,000 bonus. By signing Wednesday, four days before 
he was scheduled to be in Argentina as part of Magic Johnson's touring team, 
the popular power forward got the money, increasing his guaranteed contract for 
this season to $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like I've said before, I understand the business end of what they did and why 
they did it to me," said Rambis, who was not upset at losing the money as much 
as having signed only to be waived so early. "I just wish they could have 
handled it in a different way. I guess this was their way of apologizing." 
</P>
<P>
 Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 King guard Bobby Hurley, recovering from a Dec. 12 car crash, underwent an 
operation Wednesday to stabilize a fractured left shoulder. Doctors also 
determined his left knee will not need reconstructive surgery. Hurley could 
begin riding a stationary bike within a week or 10 days. . . . Vlade Divac, 
third among centers, is the only Laker in the top 10 in early voting for the 
All-Star game. . . . Kurt Rambis is expected to rejoin the Lakers today for 
practice and be in uniform Friday against the Clippers at the Forum.

CLIPPERS COME UP SHORT AGAIN, 106-98; PRO BASKETBALL: THEY PLAY WELL IN SPURTS 
BUT FALL TO THE SUPERSONICS FOR THIRD LOSS IN A ROW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Clipper Coach Bob Weiss might have finally found a motivational gimmick that 
works.  
</P>
<P>
 After calling team meetings and benching his starters to try to end a slump, 
Weiss put the team through a three-day mini-camp at UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 After emerging from their second training camp of the season, the Clippers 
started and and finished strongly in a 106-98 loss to the Seattle SuperSonics 
on Wednesday night before a crowd of 11,838 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Clippers, who were outscored, 63-45, in the second and third quarters, 
can work out the middle of the game, they may get back on track. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it might not be fair to judge the Clippers (11-17) against the 
SuperSonics, who at 24-3 have the best record in the NBA.  
</P>
<P>
 "We got off to a great start, and I think we played good basketball," said 
Clipper guard Mark Jackson, who had 17 points and six assists. "I think we made 
a step forward tonight and we have to feel good about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played against an excellent team. Sure, we're supposed to beat them at 
home, but we're a team that has been struggling and we feel real good. We 
played against the best team in the league and this was a winnable game. I 
think our effort tonight for 48 minutes was solid." 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss says he won't be able to determine if the mini-camp had a positive 
effect on the Clippers until after their upcoming six-game, nine-day East Coast 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
 But they still have a few things to improve on. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who are averaging a league-high 18.9 turnovers, had 25 on 
Wednesday, which the SuperSonics converted into 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing by 18 points with six minutes to play in the fourth quarter, the 
Clippers went on a 15-4 run to cut the deficit to 102-95. Forward Danny 
Manning, who had 18 points and a season-high 15 rebounds, scored 13 
fourth-quarter points. Manning had a chance to trim the deficit to five points, 
but he missed two free throws with 1:12 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we won the game, everyone would think that the camp was a great idea, but 
when we lose, everyone starts to ask questions," Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning missed 12 of 20 shots but he made six of his final eight to lead the 
Clipper comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 "I should have been more aggressive offensively tonight," Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shawn Kemp had 22 points and a season-high 15 rebounds for Seattle and Ricky 
Pierce had 18 points in 21 minutes off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers started fast, taking a 20-10 first-quarter lead as center Elmore 
Spencer and guard Ron Harper scored eight points apiece. Spencer made all four 
shots he took in the first quarter and Harper made four of five. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Clippers, who ended December by losing six of their last eight games, 
quickly reverted to their losing ways. They have now lost three in a row and 
seven of nine. 
</P>
<P>
 The SuperSonics outscored the Clippers, 23-8, in a seven minute span of the 
first and second quarters to take a 33-28 lead four minutes into the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper forward Danny Manning missed a practice Monday morning to play a small 
role in an HBO movie. Manning, whose agent, Ron Grinker, arranged the part long 
before the Clippers scheduled the mini-camp at UC Irvine, missed the morning 
session but caught a helicopter to John Wayne Airport and made Monday night's 
practice. . . . Seattle guard Nate McMillan was ejected from the game after he 
drew a double technical foul for arguing with referee Luis Grillo after fouling 
Clipper rookie guard Terry Dehere in the third quarter. . . . Clipper forward 
Mark Aguirre sat out the second half because of stomach flu. . . . Clipper 
center Elmore Spencer blocked a career-high eight shots. It was the most 
blocked shots by a Clipper since Charles Smith had seven blocks on April 11, 
1992. Spencer, who was playing before Jerry Tarkanian, his old college coach, 
had 15 points.

 Maybe it should not have been such a surprise that Wisconsin had the 
home-crowd advantage in the Rose Bowl. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It was not the first time, nor will it be the last, that a guest has been 
treated hospitably here. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Ram fans were out-shouted by those from Pittsburgh during the Steelers' 31-19 
victory in Super Bowl XIV at the Rose Bowl. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Stadium sounds like Candlestick Park South every time the San 
Francisco 49ers play there. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of Giant fans chanted "Beat L.A.!" at Dodger Stadium on the 
next-to-last day of the season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas Cowboys clearly were L.A.'s team when they beat the Raiders last 
season at the Coliseum. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Baseball, basketball, football, and hockey clubs from New York and Chicago 
always have rooting sections in Southern California. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 That is what made it so refreshing Sunday when a sellout crowd gave the home 
team, the Raiders, a lift at the Coliseum. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Joe Kelly, who played high school football a few miles away at 
Jefferson, said the defense fed on the fans' frenzy during the second half when 
the Raiders limited the Denver Broncos to three points and rallied from a 30-13 
deficit. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Raider followers do not have a glowing reputation. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Not enough of them show up for games, and those who do have been accused of 
being rowdy. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, however, 66,904 turned out, never gave up hope, were loud, but 
well-behaved, and made a difference in the Raiders' 33-30 overtime victory. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 Ready for an encore this week? . . .  
</P>

 Danny (Little Red) Lopez climbing off the canvas and roaring back to score a 
knockout. . . . Jerry Quarry delivering a thunderous left hook. . . . Art 
Aragon reveling in the catcalls. . . . Mando Ramos and Sugar Ramos pounding 
each other for three minutes every round. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, those glorious fight nights at 18th and Grand. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Let's hope there will be many more to come, beginning March 5 when boxing 
returns to what is now known as the Grand Olympic Auditorium. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The official announcement came Wednesday that Oscar De La Hoya will challenge 
World Boxing Organization junior-lightweight champion Jimmi Bredahl of Denmark 
and James Toney will defend his International Boxing Federation 
super-middleweight title against Tim Littles on opening night. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that Los Angeles is the best market in the country, if not the 
world, for boxing," said Bob Arum, who will promote a minimum of 25 shows a 
year. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If anybody can make this work, it is Arum, whose cards will be on Friday and 
Saturday nights and Saturday afternoons and include HBO, Univision, ESPN, 
European network, pay-per-view and perhaps even CBS, NBC or ABC telecasts. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya will become the Olympic's first third-generation performer, his 
father and grandfather having fought previously. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Steve Needleman, the auditorium's chief executive officer, cites one major 
improvement from the last card in 1987 -- a parking structure across the street 
that can accommodate 2,400 cars. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The capacity has been reduced from 9,200 to 7,600, primarily because the new 
seats are 22 inches wide, rather than 18. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The phone number? RIchmond 9-5171, of course. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings' 5-1 victory over Quebec Tuesday night at the Forum was their most 
impressive of the season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 They actually are hitting people now. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 What a shot defenseman Doug Houda gave Mats Sundin in front of the Nordiques' 
net.It is no coincidence that the Kings returned to winning form when the 6-2, 
190-pound Houda began to flex his muscles. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA is leading the Pacific 10 Conference in field-goal shooting percentage 
with 52.9 but is last in free-throw shooting at 57.1%. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 USC, which used to live and die with the three-point shot, isn't attempting as 
many from beyond the line as last season, but has a higher percentage. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Dan Woolridge, who picked the officials for the Orange Bowl, defended some of 
their questionable decisions by saying: "Our crew had a combined 140 years of 
officiating experience." That might have been the problem. Not enough young 
legs.

WITH LEADING SCORER OUT, FULLERTON COMES UP SHORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton left its offense on the bench while Nevada Las Vegas 
defeated the Titans on Wednesday night, 77-66, at Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, the Titan offense was wearing a black leather jacket, a green 
shirt and blue sweat pants. 
</P>
<P>
 Winston Peterson, with flu. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't exactly the news Fullerton Coach Brad Holland needed an hour before 
tipoff -- Peterson is the Titans' leading scorer and rebounder. But, then 
again, this wasn't exactly the UNLV team of years past. 
</P>
<P>
 This could be the year that Big West teams get revenge on the Rebels, 5-3 
overall and 1-0 in the conference. After scoring 39 points on Monday against 
Virginia, the lowest output in school history, UNLV couldn't put Fullerton away 
Wednesday -- and the Titans started one walk-on and suited up only eight 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton was within three points, 65-62, when the Titans' Darren Little (16 
points) dunked with 5:24 left and within five, 69-64, when James French (11 
points) drove the lane with 3:01 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kebu Stewart, who finished with a game-high 21 points, scored after an 
offensive rebound on UNLV's next trip. French turned the ball over after that, 
and a few minutes later, the Titans (2-8, 0-2) were still zero-for-Division I 
opponents for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite shooting 31% from the field -- 14% from three-point territory, 
Fullerton actually led for an eight-minute span in the first half. This also 
despite the fact that Peterson is the only Titan who can consistently bang 
under the boards. 
</P>
<P>
 But UNLV doesn't have much firepower, either. The Rebels spent at least half 
the game in a 2-3 zone, and it was what enabled them to regain the lead they 
had lost during a sluggish first half, which ended with UNLV leading, 34-28.

NEW MEXICO STATE USES DEPTH TO WEAR DOWN LONG BEACH STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 New Mexico State showed Wednesday night why it is such a heavy favorite to win 
the Big West Conference basketball title. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite several injuries to key players and the loss of another because of 
academic problems, the Aggies wore down visiting Long Beach State with superior 
depth and better offensive rebounding in a 94-76 victory before 9,136 at the 
Pan American Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward William Howze was declared ineligible by New Mexico State this week, 
reserve guard Lance Jackson learned he had a stress fracture in his left shin 
and forward D.J. Jackson sprained an ankle in practice. 
</P>
<P>
 During Wednesday's game, guard Corey Rogers sprained an ankle and was carried 
from the court and guard Thomas Wyatt needed three stiches to close a cut on 
his eyelid. 
</P>
<P>
 But New Mexico State, with seven junior college transfers, has one of the 
deepest benches in the conference, and it showed. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory improved the Aggies' record to 9-1 overall and 2-0 in the Big 
West. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aggies couldn't shake the 49ers in the first 25 minutes, despite opening 
seven-point leads three times. 
</P>
<P>
 A basket by 49er forward Terrance O'Kelley cut the Aggies' lead to 44-42 with 
16:22 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jackson, who finished with 17 points and nine rebounds, answered with a 
three-point shot, Wyatt tipped in a missed layup by teammate James Dockery and 
Wyatt's steal seconds later led to a breakaway layup by Rogers. By the time 
Long Beach Coach Seth Greenberg called for a timeout, the 49ers (5-3, 0-1) 
trailed, 56-44. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aggies held a 48-35 edge in rebounding, including a 25-23 advantage on the 
offensive end. Long Beach had 23 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach forward Rod Hannibal led all scorers with 20 points. Reserve James 
Cotton scored 14. PAUL McLEOD

 Damon Stoudamire scored 30 points and Khalid Reeves added 24 as No. 9 Arizona 
struggled through an off-night to beat Arizona State, 98-81, Wednesday night at 
Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats (11-1), who turned in their finest game of the season last 
Thursday with a 119-95 victory over then-No. 7 Michigan, played lethargically 
in the first 20 minutes and led only 37-31 at halftime despite a 35-19 
rebounding advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 But then they got their fast break going and outscored Arizona State, 21-4, to 
open the second half with Reeves leading the way. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 1 Arkansas 87, Mississippi 61 -- Clint McDaniel made three steals during a 
20-0 run that lifted the Razorbacks at Fayetteville, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rebels (5-4) went scoreless for more than six minutes in the first half. 
During a four-minute span, Mississippi got only one shot out of eight 
possessions. When the run ended with 9:56 left in the half, Arkansas (10-0) 
led, 25-5. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 2 North Carolina 88, North Carolina State 58 -- The Tar Heels started the 
second half with an 18-5 run and finally found their touch from the foul line 
to win at Chapel Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tar Heels (11-1) won their ninth consecutive game and have defeated the 
Wolfpack (4-7) by an average of 36 points over the last three meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 5 Kansas 90, North Carolina Asheville 44 -- Steve Woodberry scored 16 
points to lead the Jayhawks to their 10th consecutive victory, at Lawrence, 
Kan. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodberry hit two short jump shots and a three-pointer in a 28-6 run early in 
the second half for Kansas (14-1). 
</P>
<P>
 No. 10 Purdue 68, Northwestern 67 -- Glenn Robinson, shut out for the first 7 
1/2 minutes, scored 34 points, including the winning basket with nine seconds 
left, to lead the Boilermakers at Evanston, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Purdue (12-0) went ahead, 66-61, on Robinson's three-pointer. But Pat Baldwin 
made three consecutive baskets as the Wildcats (9-1) took a 67-66 lead with 40 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 13 Michigan 75, Michigan State 64 -- Dugan Fife made two three-pointers in 
a decisive second-half burst and finished with a career-high 13 points to lead 
the Wolverines at Ann Arbor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines (9-2) never trailed, but they couldn't put Michigan State away 
until the Spartans (9-4) went cold over the final 10:47. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 17 Cincinnati 103, Chicago State 49 -- LaZelle Durden scored 33 points as 
Cincinnati beat Chicago State at Cincinnati.

half as Cincinnati (11-2) pulled away to a 45-17 lead over Chicago State 
(1-12).

<P>
 No. 25 Marquette 79, Memphis State 67 -- Damon Key scored 18 points and Roney

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Patrick Roy made 32 saves for his fourth shutout of the season and the 
Montreal Canadiens beat the Quebec Nordiques, 4-0, Wednesday night in the 
second of four games to be played in Phoenix this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd of 11,393 cheered loudly for the Canadiens when they were 
introduced, but their loudest ovation came when it was announced that the 
Phoenix Suns had won in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy lowered his goals-against average to 2.31, second in the league to Dominik 
Hasek of Buffalo (1.80). 
</P>
<P>
 Calgary 4, New York Rangers 1 -- Rookie goaltender Andrei Trefilov outplayed 
all-star Mike Richter to lift the injury-riddled Flames at New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Trefilov, playing in only his second NHL game this season and third overall, 
made 52 saves as the Flames ended the Rangers' 16-game home unbeaten streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartford 4, Winnipeg 0 -- Sean Burke stopped 20 shots for his first shutout in 
five years, leading the Whalers at Hartford. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke made nine saves in the final period to preserve the fifth shutout of his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver 7, Ottawa 2 -- Cliff Ronning, Murray Craven, Gino Odjick and Pavel 
Bure scored power-play goals to lead the Canucks at Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory ended a three-game losing string for Vancouver.

 Chris Antley rode both halves of the early double, replacing an ailing Pat 
Valenzuela aboard Snoboy in the first race. . . . "Jeff's cerebral pressure is 
much better," trainer Wayne Lukas said of his son and chief assistant, who has 
been in a coma for three weeks since suffering multiple skull fractures while 
trying to flag down a runaway horse at his father's barn. Lukas' condition was 
listed as serious. BILL CHRISTINE

INGLEWOOD PULLS TOGETHER, POUNDS REDONDO; PREP BASKETBALL: SENTINELS, WITHOUT 
FLOOR LEADER TURKS, BRUSH ASIDE SEA HAWKS FOR SECOND TIME THIS SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER BARZILAI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sam Turks or no Sam Turks, the Inglewood High basketball team appears to have 
Redondo's number. The Sentinels easily beat the Sea Hawks for the second time 
this season, 86-59, Wednesday night in a nonleague game at Redondo. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Turks scored 16 points to help Inglewood beat Redondo, 86-64, in 
the championship game of the Pacific Shores tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Turks missed Wednesday's game after bruising his left thigh in Thursday's loss 
to Westchester in the final of the Artesia tournament. Inglewood Coach Pat Roy 
said he expects the senior to play Wednesday in an important Bay League opener 
at Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 But even without its floor leader, Inglewood (13-2) pulled together behind 
strong games by forwards Paul Pierce and Antoine Young and backup point guard 
Carlo Calhoun. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought when we played them earlier this season we didn't really do all 
the things we wanted," Roy said. "I think tonight the team came together and 
they really picked up the slack." 
</P>
<P>
 Pierce and Young worked well inside against Redondo (12-3), which was at a 
disadvantage after center Brian Hattingh left the game in the second quarter 
because of a sprained right ankle. The 6-foot-6 senior is expected to miss a 
minimum of two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Antoine did a great job for us," Roy said. "He was the spark. We wanted to 
get the ball down low, and he and Paul did a good job down there." 
</P>
<P>
 After leading at halftime, 28-23, the Sentinels scored 31 points in the third 
quarter. Inglewood finished the quarter with a 14-4 run to take a 59-40 lead 
entering the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Young filled in for Ralph Shelton, who was in foul trouble, and contributed 13 
points and five rebounds in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "All year long the third quarter has been ours," Roy said. "It either makes us 
or breaks us. We just made some good adjustments at halftime." 
</P>
<P>
 Calhoun, a junior getting his first start at point guard, began a little 
shaky, but calmed down in the second half, finishing with nine points. 
</P>
<P>
 "Carlo came in and did a real good job," Roy said. "He was able to help get 
the ball down low where we were too much for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Down low was where Pierce picked up most of his game-high 21 points and 12 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Morgan Ensberg led Redondo with 16 points and forward Ahmad Holmes, 
filling in for Hattingh, scored 12.

LOSSES CONTINUING TO MOUNT FOR WINLESS LIONS; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: LOYOLA, WHICH 
HAS THE NATION'S LONGEST LOSING STREAK, MAY HAVE TO DO WITHOUT SENIOR FORWARD 
ZAN MASON THIS SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By now, Loyola Marymount's long-suffering basketball fans have all asked the 
same question: 
</P>
<P>
 When are the Lions going to win a game? 
</P>
<P>
 With Monday night's 92-91 overtime loss to Fairfield, Loyola dropped to 0-9 
and extended the nation's longest current Division I losing streak to 19 games. 
The Lions claimed that dubious distinction after Youngstown State ended an 
18-game losing streak with an 80-62 victory over Central Connecticut State on 
Dec. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola has not won since Jan. 30 of last season and is off to its worst start 
since opening the 1981-82 season 0-10 on the way to a 3-24 record, the worst in 
school history not counting a 2-26 season in 1979-80 that included 12 forfeits 
because of an ineligible player. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions, who have lost their last three games by a total of seven points, 
including two in overtime, think they are close to turning things around. 
</P>
<P>
 But a potentially season-ending injury to senior forward Zan Mason has 
weakened the team's outlook. Mason, an All-West Coast Conference selection last 
season, tore ligaments in his left knee Dec. 30 against Texas A & M and will 
miss a minimum of six weeks. He was Loyola's second-leading scorer and 
third-leading rebounder. 
</P>
<P>
 For a team short in experienced front-court players, Mason's injury could make 
it tough for the Lions to avoid repeating as the last-place team in the 
conference. They are currently the only WCC team with a losing record and open 
conference play Jan. 14 against St. Mary's at Gersten Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Loyola's problems, second-year Coach John Olive has maintained a 
positive outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one is happy on this basketball team, but everyone feels they are getting 
better individually and getting better as a team," he said. "We shot ourselves 
in the foot at the end of a lot of these close ballgames. The kids feel if we 
can fine-tune a few areas, we'll be all right." 
</P>
<P>
 Olive said he isn't concerned about Loyola's losing streak, which is partly 
the result of a demanding nonconference schedule that included games against 
two top 20 teams -- UCLA and Wisconsin -- as well as USC and Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't have scheduled the way I scheduled if I was worried about 
something like that," Olive said, referring to the losing streak. "I consider 
ourselves 0-9. This is this year's basketball team. If (the streak) had been a 
factor, I would have scheduled easy early on and ended it." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with a demanding schedule, though, Olive didn't expect to still be 
looking for the season's first victory. Loyola hopes to get it Friday night 
when it plays host to Buffalo (4-8), a 90-72 loser to Cal State Northridge on 
Tuesday. The Lions won at Buffalo last season, 76-72. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been very frustrating," Olive said. "We've lost three overtime games and 
a two-point game in the last 2 1/2 weeks. We just haven't gotten it done. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm just like the kids. Each game is a new game, each day is a new day. 
You can't overwhelm yourself with what went on the night before." 
</P>
<P>
 Olive, who signed a five-year contract before the 1992-93 season, said he 
hasn't felt any pressure to win because of his 7-29 record at Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
 "The administration has been fabulous and the boosters have been outstanding," 
he said. "They appreciate the effort the kids have put forth. Crazy as it 
sounds, they all see improvement and feel we're on the right track."

PREPS / ROB FERNAS: 9TH-GRADER MUST CLEAR HURDLES TO RUN FOR CARSON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Patrick McCall wants to compete for the Carson High track team in the spring. 
Carson likes the idea too. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a problem. McCall is a ninth-grader at Curtiss Junior High in 
Carson and won't attend high school until the fall because Carson only has 
grades 10 through 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the restriction, McCall's father, Nate, has petitioned the Los 
Angeles Unified School District to allow his son to compete for Carson even 
though he isn't a student at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wants a chance to compete like everyone else," said the elder McCall, 
pointing out that most high schools have ninth grade. "I'm doing everything I 
can as a parent so that can happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Carson track Coach Bill Mocnik said McCall could excel on the varsity team as 
a ninth-grader. 
</P>
<P>
 "To look at him, he's really impressive," Mocnik said. "He can help us, that's 
for sure." 
</P>
<P>
 McCall, 14, has set four national age-group records since he began competing 
in track at age 9. His specialties are the sprints and long jump. Last summer, 
he helped the Los Angeles Jets track club set a Junior Olympic record of 3 
minutes 23.96 seconds in the 1,600-meter relay, running the first leg in 51.8 
seconds. As an eighth-grader, he long-jumped 22 feet 6 inches. The Carson 
record is 23-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he is not affiliated with a high school, McCall has been invited to 
compete in the long jump at the prestigious Sunkist Invitational Feb. 19 at the 
Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 McCall cleared the first hurdle last month in his attempt to compete for 
Carson when the Interscholastic Athletics Committee of the City Section voted 
unanimously to grant him permission to pursue the matter. McCall still needs 
approval of the L.A. Unified school board and the other seven schools in the 
Southern Pacific Conference, his father said. 
</P>
<P>
 If McCall is granted eligibility, Mocnik hopes it will halt a recent trend of 
promising track athletes transferring out of Carson's district in order to 
compete in ninth grade at other schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've lost a lot of talent here because of that," Mocnik said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McCall's talents are not restricted to track. A running back in football, he 
helped the Pop Warner Carson Jets win the national Junior Bantam Division title 
last season, scoring 21 touchdowns in 12 games. The team was 11-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-9, 170-pound McCall was coached by his father, who also is an 
assistant on Carson's City Section 4-A Division champion football team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Patrick has a good chance to start on the varsity next season," said Nate 
McCall, who has some football credentials of his own. He was a standout running 
back at Centennial High and New Mexico and played two seasons in the Canadian 
Football League. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Peninsula's basketball team is off to a strong start in its first season under 
Coach Cliff Warren, despite a rash of injury and illness. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a look at the Panther disabled list, past and present: 
</P>
<P>
 * Senior guard Brian Hogentogler, the team's leading scorer, is out for the 
season after undergoing knee surgery to repair ligament and cartilage damage 
suffered in a game last month against Serra. 
</P>
<P>
 * Senior forward Keith Harter, expected to be the team's first front-court 
player off the bench, is sidelined indefinitely with mononucleosis. 
</P>
<P>
 * Junior point guard Andy Jensen has been bothered by an ankle problem that 
forced him to miss a game last week and Monday's practice. 
</P>
<P>
 * Forward Andrew Klein, a talented 6-foot-6 sophomore, is just now rounding 
into form after missing the first four games because of a wrist injury. 
</P>
<P>
 The casualties have made it a disruptive season for Warren, whose team brought 
an 11-3 record into Wednesday night's nonleague game against South Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying, but we've had so many injuries," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peninsula overcame its problems to finish third last week at the Seattle 
Christmas Classic, a 16-team tournament that featured some of the best teams in 
Washington. Prior to that, the Panthers took third at the Pacific Shores 
tournament and won the consolation championship at the Irvine tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 With only one senior starter, 6-4 forward Brian Bowles, Peninsula has relied 
on a lineup that features Klein and another sophomore, 6-4 guard Phil Belin, 
and 6-5 junior forward Marcus Boyd. Klein was named all-tournament at Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though we're young, we have talent," Warren said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, look for Peninsula to challenge favored Inglewood for the Bay 
League title. The teams meet Wednesday night at Peninsula in an attractive 
league opener. 
</P>
<P>
 "The future is right now," Warren said. "We want to make sure (the 
underclassmen) are ready to play right now, not next year." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like Peninsula's Warren, a rejuvenated Rich Masson returned to coaching this 
season after taking a year off. He has guided Carson to a 9-4 start and the 
finals of two tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colts traveled to Northern California last week and took second at the 
16-team Clovis tournament, losing to Tokay of Stockton, 70-64, in the final. 
The victory gave Tokay a 13-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really should have won, but the kids got tired at the end," Masson said. 
"And we got a little of that home cooking. It was only the second time since 
I've been coaching that people came up after the game and apologized for the 
officiating." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Jamar Reid, Carson's point guard, suffered a badly sprained ankle at 
Clovis, but senior Tony Harvey stepped in and played well enough to earn a spot 
on the all-tournament team along with senior swingman Anthony Browder, the 
Colts' leading scorer. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last week, the 6-4 Harvey was mostly known for his exploits on the 
football field. He was an All-Pacific League receiver on Carson's 4-A 
championship team in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first year Harvey has ever played competitive basketball, but 
he's talented," Masson said. "It's a bit of a luxury having a 6-4 player at 
point guard, which has kind of been our Achilles' heel." 
</P>
<P>
 Carson's success at Clovis came after it won the championship of the Oxnard 
tournament, routing the host school, 92-33, in the final. Senior forward Cortez 
Brockington was named most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done pretty well, considering we haven't had all our people," said 
Masson, whose team opens Southern Pacific Conference play Friday night at 
Narbonne. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the Banning Booster Club will meet with school 
administrators Friday in an effort to have Ed Paculba removed as the Pilot 
football coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Didinger, vice principal in charge of athletics, said administrators 
will listen to the concerns of boosters but have no plans to replace Paculba, 
who has a 12-10 record in two seasons at Banning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not in the business of having the booster club hire and fire the 
coaching staff," Didinger said. "We've met with the coach and (assistants) who 
are teachers here and they're firmly convinced they want to continue coaching. 
Our opinion is that they are the coaches." 
</P>
<P>
 Booster club officials said they have collected more than 400 signatures on a 
petition calling for Paculba's removal. Among other things, the boosters are 
concerned that several players whose parents are unhappy with the program will 
transfer to other schools if Paculba returns as coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to listen to what they have to say," Didinger said. "But at this 
point we have a coach and that's Coach Paculba. We don't plan on releasing 
him."

 Surprising Mary Star, never known as a basketball power, has won two 
consecutive tournaments and will bring a seven-game winning streak into its 
Santa Fe League opener Friday night against Verbum Dei at Compton College. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-year Coach George Pisano said the Stars have a good chance of repeating 
as Santa Fe runners-up behind Verbum Dei, ranked 16th in Southern California by 
The Times, and should be a contender in the Southern Section Division V-AA 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a threat in our division," Pisano said. "We have some talent, but we 
can't match up with larger schools." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Star (10-3) won the eight-team San Bernardino Aquinas and Bishop Union 
tournaments after going 2-2 in the El Segundo tournament. The Stars have lost 
twice to Pacific Hills -- formerly Bel-Air Prep, the defending Division V-A 
champion -- and to St. Bernard. 
</P>
<P>
 The team's 10-player roster includes eight seniors, led by 6-foot guard Tony 
DiLeva, who is averaging 16.6 points and was named most valuable player at the 
Aquinas and Bishop Union tournaments. Other standouts for Mary Star include 6-5 
senior center Paul Basich and 6-3 senior guard Simon Zanki, a transfer from 
Bishop Montgomery. Notes

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: DESPITE A KEY LOSS, VENTURA STILL WINNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The high quality of the Ventura men's basketball team was reinforced again 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates beat Cerritos, 83-79, in three overtimes in the championship game 
of the Hancock tournament for their 19th consecutive victory. Ventura (19-1), 
ranked No. 1 in the state, survived against Cerritos, ranked No. 3, without its 
best player, Brandon Jessie. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessie, a 6-foot-5 sophomore forward, was benched by Coach Philip Mathews for 
missing the team's 11:30 curfew the night before. Jessie, who leads the team 
with a 22.8-point average, was the most valuable player in three of the 
previous four tournaments in which Ventura participated this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfred Kennedy, a 6-9 sophomore forward, also was disciplined. JUNIOR COLLEGES

<P>
 One of the most important football tests for Gil Carrillo, the workhorse 
running back at Moorpark the past two seasons, is around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrillo (5-11, 195 pounds) will participate in a tryout with the Winnipeg 
Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League on Jan. 13 at Golden West College. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very excited," Carrillo said. "I can't wait. I'll definitely be ready." 
</P>
<P>
 Carrillo, the two-time Western State Conference North Division offensive 
player or co-player of the year, rushed for 2,287 yards and scored 23 
touchdowns as a Raider. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrillo has no college eligibility because he attended CS Northridge two 
years on a track scholarship. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Another Raider looking for a new place to play is quarterback Todd Preston. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Westlake High standout, who redshirted at Cal in 1991 before 
playing the past two seasons at Moorpark, is on a two-stop recruiting trip this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Preston visited Eastern Illinois on Wednesday and will visit Memphis State on 
Friday. They are the only Division I schools to contact him. 
</P>
<P>
 Preston (6-2, 195) was an All-Western State Conference North Division 
first-team selection in 1993 after passing for 1,651 yards and 19 touchdowns in 
the regular season. CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
<P>
 Even-Handed Tack 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Yard, a 6-foot-6 forward, is right-handed. But he scores so often with 
his left hand that many observers assume he is ambidextrous. 
</P>
<P>
 But get the ball to Yard inside the key and he is a threat with either hand. 
He scored a career-high 30 points against Buffalo on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Many games he scores the majority of his points with left-handed layups and 
hooks. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite routinely giving away several inches, Yard is shooting 51.1% -- more 
than three percentage points higher than the next-best Northridge starter. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Northridge men's basketball team doesn't have a great winning percentage 
-- the Matadors are 2-10 -- but it has an impressive grade-point average. 
During the fall semester, Northridge players combined for an average GPA of 
3.18 out of a possible 4.0. Shane O'Doherty, a junior, earned straight A's. 
Ozan Korkut had all A's with the exception of one A-minus. In all, nine of the 
13 players were at 3.06 or better. CAL LUTHERAN

 One Victory at a Time 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the Kingsmen (10-0) have set school records for consecutive victories 
and best start, Coach Mike Dunlap is trying to ease pressure by suggesting that 
the players focus on winning a third consecutive Southern California 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference basketball title. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to concentrate on playing good basketball every game, and getting 
ready for conference," he said. "If we happen to lose, it's not going to be a 
big deal as long as we play well." THE MASTER'S 
</P>
<P>
 Better All the Time 
</P>
<P>
 Although the victories continue to add up for Mustangs (13-3), first-year 
Coach Bill Oates seems to be more concerned with his basketball team's 
continual improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really just concentrating on improving each game," Oates said. "If we 
continue to do that, everything else should fall into place." 
</P>
<P>
 Mustang sophomore James Mosley doesn't disagree with Oates' philosophy, but he 
is looking to go on another substantial winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Bakersfield, defending NCAA Division II champion, snapped Master's 
seven-game winning streak last week, but the Mustangs have since won two in a 
row. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to use this home stand to get another good streak going," Mosley 
said. "That's important to us."

AGOURA SHOCKS THOUSAND OAKS WITH LATE RALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After failing to score in the first quarter, Agoura High overwhelmed Thousand 
Oaks in the final quarter to earn an improbable 41-36 victory in a Marmonte 
League opener Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura outscored the three-time defending Marmonte champion Lancers, 23-9, in 
the final eight minutes after being on the wrong end of a 12-0 score at the 
close of the opening quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior guard Maurice Moore led the Chargers (7-4) by scoring six of his 13 
points -- including the go-ahead basket -- during the final period. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were not very patient in the first quarter," said Charger Coach Kevin 
Pasky, whose team missed all 13 of its shots in the first eight minutes. "We 
were passing the ball once and putting up the first three we saw. We finally 
started to move the ball around and look for shots inside. That's how Maurice 
got off a good shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore's five-foot jump shot at the left of the lane gave the Chargers their 
first lead, 37-36, with 1:10 to play. The Lancers (9-4) then committed a 
turnover trying to inbound the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Benon Ureda made two free throws to give the Chargers a 39-36 lead with 30 
seconds to play. Lancer forward Jason Hartman (11 points, 13 rebounds) tried to 
tie the score with a three-point shot which rattled inside the rim and popped 
out. Agoura's Brian Laibow grabbed the rebound with seven seconds left, was 
fouled and made two free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura made three of 22 shots in the first half and 13 of 45 in the game. 
Thousand Oaks, which was unbeaten in league play last season, made 16 of 51 
shots and committed 17 turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even in the first quarter, we knew we would come back," Ureda said. "It's not 
a good habit to get down like that, but we've come back a lot of times."

GRANT ROMPS WHILE FORSCUTT GAINS REPRIEVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Grant High's Rick Forscutt went into Wednesday's Valley Pac-8 Conference 
matchup against Birmingham thinking he was playing his last basketball game in 
a Lancer uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 But minutes after helping Grant score a 50-29 victory over the Braves, 
Forscutt received a stay from his parents amounting to two more games as a 
Lancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Forscutt, a 6-foot-8 senior center, was scheduled to move to Utah with his 
parents on Friday, but now escrow on their home is not expected to close before 
Jan. 14. Another week in Van Nuys means Forscutt will be around to help the 
Lancers in contests against Sylmar and Monroe. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's better than nothing," Grant Coach Howie Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine has been counting the days until Forscutt's departure, and the team's 
leading scorer and rebounder will be sorely missed. 
</P>
<P>
 As usual, Forscutt was the force against Birmingham (3-6, 0-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Grant (10-3, 2-0) opened the game with a 9-2 run and Forscutt accounted for 
eight of the Lancers' 11 first-quarter points on his way to scoring 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant, which didn't trail after the opening basket, owned a 21-15 lead at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers, shooting 43% from the field, benefited from a tenacious defense 
and Birmingham's atrocious marksmanship (12 of 49, 24%). The Braves didn't 
reach double-figure scoring in any quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expected them to come out a lot tougher and give us a game, but we were 
able to hold them off with our defense," said Forscutt, who pulled down eight 
of his 10 rebounds in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 An 11-2 Grant run to start the third quarter gave the Lancers a 32-17 lead and 
the rest seemed academic.

ROUNDUP; HARVARD STILL PERFECT AFTER NARROW ESCAPE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Chaminade High center Carmen Rossi missed a four-foot shot as time expired, 
and Harvard-Westlake escaped with a 52-51 victory in a Mission League 
basketball game Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard-Westlake improved to 13-0 (3-0 in league play) while Chaminade (4-8, 
0-3) lost its sixth game of the season by fewer than three points. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Chaminade did not have a starter taller than 6-feet-2, the Eagles 
managed to stay in the game by running a deliberate, spread offense that did 
not allow Harvard-Westlake's Collins twins (Jason, 6-8, and Jaron, 6-7) to be 
effective inside on defense.

points to lead the Celts in a Mission League game at Crespi (5-8, 1-2). Bryan 
Spaulding added 11 points. Marcaccini, a 6-2 junior, is the younger brother of 
Monte Marcaccini, who is currently playing in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake 82, Newbury Park 79 -- Guard guard Steve Aylsworth made a short bank 
shot with three seconds remaining in the fourth quarter to tie the Marmonte 
League game, 73-73, and teammate Erik Bentz scored four points in overtime for 
Westlake (7-2, 1-0). 
</P>
<P>
 Buena 62, Rio Mesa 51 -- John Tobias scored 10 of his 19 points in the fourth 
quarter, including the game's final seven as the Bulldogs (6-5, 1-0) overcame a 
one-point deficit after three quarters in the Channel League game at Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo 74, Simi Valley 59 -- Jim Hansen scored 22 points and Andrew 
Richards and Kevin Nathaniel each added 15 as Camarillo (5-6, 1-0) upset the 
Pioneers (10-4, 1-1) in a Marmonte League game at Camarillo.

 Chrysler Corp.'s new compact sedans will be the first mass-market cars since 
the days of crank-start engines to come off the assembly line without ashtrays.

<P>
 The third-biggest U.S. auto maker plans to offer the ashtray and a cigarette 
lighter as options on its sedans this year, making room for a coffee mug rest 
and a hookup for a cellular phone.

 RETURN TO FENDER: How much does Fullerton love its native son, the late Leo 
Fender? The Fullerton Museum Center has broken its daily attendance record with 
its current exhibit on the pioneer electric guitar designer, which runs through 
April 2. . . . The museum is drawing 100-plus visitors for the first time, to 
see "Five Decades of Fender: The Sound Heard Around the World." It includes 
footage of such celebrated Fender-designed guitar players as Jimi Hendrix and 
Bonnie Raitt.

GOVERNOR CALLS FOR MORE JOBS AND PRISONS, TAX REDUCTIONS; CALIFORNIA: WILSON 
SAYS MIDDLE CLASS, SOME BUSINESSES SHOULD GET BREAKS. HE CALLS NEW JOBS AND 
SAFE STREETS THE 'TWIN PILLARS OF THE FUTURE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Citing job creation and crime reduction as the "twin pillars" on which he 
hopes to build California's future, Gov. Pete Wilson on Wednesday proposed 
rewarding businesses that hire new workers and punishing more harshly violent 
criminals who repeatedly break the law. 
</P>
<P>
 In an election-year State of the State Address to a joint session of the 
Legislature, the Republican governor returned to two themes that helped him win 
the state's highest office in 1990: taxes and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said the state should cut taxes for business and the middle class, 
reduce regulation, put more cops on the street and build prisons to hold more 
criminals serving longer sentences than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 Combining a pointed attack on federal policy-makers with a conciliatory call 
for bipartisan action on state problems, Wilson urged lawmakers to build on a 
year of cooperative efforts in which he and the Legislature enacted a package 
of bills intended to make California a better place in which to do business. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor put further behind him his negative rhetoric of 1992, when he 
complained in his State of the State speech that California had "lost much of 
its competitive edge" and warned that the changes he wanted would "cause 
discomfort." The only discomfort he promised in this speech was for the state's 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson linked his two key issues by insisting that companies will not build 
new plants or expand existing ones in a state in which their customers and 
workers do not feel secure in their homes or on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "New jobs and safe streets are the twin pillars on which we must build 
California's future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's fourth State of the State speech was received politely in the ornate 
Assembly chamber dominated by Democrats. His 30-minute address was interrupted 
15 times by applause. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two Democrats who are vying to oppose Wilson in the fall -- state 
Treasurer Kathleen Brown and Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi -- quickly 
criticized Wilson's leadership afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Wilson spoke, state Democratic Party Chairman Bill Press tried to 
beat him to the punch by releasing a three-minute video featuring excerpts from 
the governor's earlier addresses alongside statements about his record in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Press described the address as "an empty string of promises by a man who's had 
three years -- and never delivered." 
</P>
<P>
 Press said Wilson's call for lower taxes and tougher measures to deal with 
violent crime were good ideas, but he questioned the governor's ability to make 
good on his promises. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've hard it all before," Press said. "We kept waiting for the goods. They 
never arrived. And it won't be any different this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti of Van Nuys said Wilson was in a 
"campaign mode," cynically promising to boost public safety funding while 
cutting taxes, a pledge Roberti said the governor cannot keep. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was plainly an election-year speech," Roberti said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson did not say where he would find the $140 million his aides said it 
would cost to provide the tax cuts he proposed. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor suggested a $1,000 tax credit for each job, up to 100, created in 
start-up small businesses. And he suggested an 18% state income tax cut for 
Californians earning less than $40,000. He said he might seek more tax cuts as 
the year progresses. 
</P>
<P>
 "California must go further in making our tax structure competitive," Wilson 
said. "Taxes are a cost of doing business. States that tax less than California 
are clearly more attractive on that score." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also called for reduced regulations and paperwork and a doubling of the 
state's export finance program. He repeated his call to abolish the state 
Energy Commission, added the Integrated Waste Management Board to his hit list 
and suggested that the state trim middle management jobs by 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson complained that the state's efforts often are thwarted by the federal 
government. Every time the state takes a step forward, a "giant push back" 
comes from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just that further defense cuts are idling aerospace workers," Wilson 
said. "Federal water cuts are squeezing our farmers. A failed immigration 
policy is busting our budget. And higher federal taxes are pinching our 
wallets." 
</P>
<P>
 On crime, Wilson said the state needs to focus on three points: more police on 
the street, improved programs to keep children from turning to crime, and 
stiffer sentences for violent offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 He made two references to Polly Klaas, the 12-year-old Petaluma girl who was 
kidnaped from her home and murdered, and to Richard Allen Davis, the repeat 
felon who has confessed to the crime. Wilson called Allen an "animal" who 
should never have been released from prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sympathize with those neglected children who are tempted by drugs or 
gangs," Wilson said. "But when as teen-agers or adults they victimize others, 
our sympathy must yield to responsibility. And our first responsibility must be 
always to protect the innocent and punish the guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Wilson said, more than 400 children were murdered in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our streets are stained with the blood of our children, and it's got to 
stop," Wilson said. "Damn it, it's got to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson proposed hiring 500 new California Highway Patrol officers and 
assigning them to high-crime communities to help local police. He cited a 
special program in the city of East Palo Alto in which a regional 
crime-fighting effort reduced the murder rate by 86%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Swift response and united community worked in East Palo Alto, and it can work 
around our state to reduce the fears felt by too many Californians," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also repeated his call for adoption of the "three strikes" measure to 
lock up three-time violent felons for life. If the Legislature does not pass 
the measure, he said, the voters will enact the proposal as a ballot 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 For certain arsonists and sexual offenders, Wilson said, the punishment should 
be even swifter: life in prison for the first offense. Repeat felons caught 
with a gun should face the same fate, he said. Credits allowing prisoners to 
cut their sentence in half by working and behaving well while behind bars 
should be curtailed, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to turn career criminals into career inmates," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor said the state should build six new prisons -- adding to the 26 
already housing more than 110,000 inmates -- financed by a $2-billion bond 
measure that he wants to put before the voters later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson acknowledged that the anti-crime effort would be expensive. He said he 
would rather spend the money on universities than prisons. But the state, he 
said, has no choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does anyone want to tell me how much a child's life is worth? Does anyone 
want to assign a dollar value to 400 murdered children?" Wilson asked. Then he 
added: "We can -- and we must -- prevent these crimes by building the prisons 
we need to put violent criminals away." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson made few attempts at soaring rhetoric and outlined no expansive vision 
for the state's future, as he did in his first State of the State speech in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Californians, he said, are less concerned about the coming century than "about 
the security of their job today and the safety of their family tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 But neither did Wilson lay down a controversial agenda like the one he 
proposed in 1992, when he waged confrontational, partisan conflict with the 
Democrats in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we work together, we can restore California as America's preeminent state 
to live, work and raise a family," he said. "We can ensure a California 
comeback." 
</P>
<P>
 To emphasize his bipartisan approach, Wilson plans a three-day Midwest tour 
next week to sell California as a place to do business, and at least three 
legislative leaders say they intend to accompany him. 
</P>
<P>
 An adviser agreed that Wilson's address was high on practical proposals and 
short on memorable flourishes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a no-frills, nuts-and-bolts kind of speech," said Dan Schnur, Wilson's 
campaign spokesman.

 GUARD DUTY: With police still hunting the Valley molester, parents are doing 
guard duty. . . . At El Dorado School, mothers of the Parent Safety Express are 
on hand at school dismissal each day, holding up signs indicating which 
direction they will walk (B3). . . . Dozens of children who formerly walked 
home alone are now being chaperoned. 
</P>
<P>
 BURY HIM NOT: It's an ancient tradition in many cultures -- burying the elite 
in cathedrals -- but that cuts no ice in Burbank. The archbishop of the Syrian 
Orthodox Church wanted to be entombed, when his time comes, at St. Ephraim's 
church. "The heart of our tradition and religious belief," the pastor said. . . 
. No way, said the City Council, refusing to amend the code that restricts 
burials to one cemetery zone. (B1)

 KING'S LEGACY: Two Valley students won in an annual essay contest on Dr. 
Martin Luther King Jr. (B2): sixth-grader Hannah Whang of Welby Way School in 
West Hills and Vinh Phan, above, of Kennedy High in Granada Hills. Vinh, born 
in Vietnam, said King wanted racial justice but yet "did not want us to push 
and shove to see who would get there first, but . . . to walk side by side to 
get there together." 
</P>
<P>
 POUNDING AWAY: With the feast-filled holidays ended, you're perhaps a trifle 
too grand, a tad too expansive, a bit too . . . well, fat. For the New Year, 
you resolve to get to the gym, to pedal and pump and sweat. The Around the 
Valley column (B5) joins those who suffer for svelte. . . . Alas, it's not long 
before the siren call of a pizza dooms these good intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 FEW ARE CHOSEN: The first major local discount home improvement retailer is 
great for the Santa Clarita Valley -- but not so good for the big turnout of 
job seekers. More than 6,000 people applied for work at the new Home Depot -- 
but only about 100 were hired. (B16) T. W. McGarry

 SLOW DEATH: It's been two years since a death sentence was handed down in 
Ventura County, but prosecutors are trying to send two more men to the gas 
chamber: Christopher Sattiewhite, on trial for a 1992 slaying, and Mark Scott 
Thornton, accused of a killing last year (B1). . . . Neither needs to worry 
about cyanide pellets dropping into acid any time soon. The county's 
longest-serving Death Row inmate -- Alejandro Gilbert Ruiz, sentenced in 1980 
-- still has five years worth of appeals, prosecutor Richard Holmes said. . . . 
Ruiz's appeal faults a psychiatric report. Since he practiced voodoo, he says, 
he should have had a voodoo psychiatrist. 
</P>
<P>
 WOMEN STYMIED: Although female golfers make up nearly 40% of the nation's 
total, some clubs still discriminate (A5). . . . At 73-year-old Saticoy Country 
Club, rules that prevented women from playing on Wednesdays or Saturdays were 
eliminated years ago. But traditions persist, said Roma Chandler, former 
president of the Saticoy Women's Golf Assn. . . . "The unwritten rule is 
Tuesday and Friday, women get the first tee-offs, and Wednesday is men's day. 
But it's a lot better than it used to be." 
</P>
<P>
 FAR OUT: As if the Ventura Freeway weren't scary enough, here's a new hazard: 
kidnapers from outer space. Two women driving through Camarillo say they spent 
a couple of hours on a spaceship being ogled by aliens (Ventura County Life, 
Page 18). . . . Abduction reports give similar descriptions of the culprits: 
short, gray, hairless creatures with four-digit hands, dark eyes and tiny 
mouths. 
</P>
<P>
 ROAD SIGN: That new sign for the Thousand Oaks Auto Mall has finally been 
approved (B5), and the builder says it will be a beaut. . . . "It's unlike any 
other auto mall sign you will see anywhere," said Susan Bailey of Signature 
Signs. Highlights: foliage-bedecked pillars supporting a 5 1/2-foot-diameter 
globe, and brass letters hailing the auto mall as the world's largest. . . . 
Motorists drive right past the existing sign without noticing, she said. "Next 
thing they know, they're at the Oxnard Auto Mall."

WILSON CHOICE FOR MINIMUM WAGE BOARD REJECTED; COMMISSIONS: DEMOCRATS SCUTTLE 
REAPPOINTMENT OF TWO-TERM MEMBER. ORGANIZED LABOR HAD ATTACKED HER AS HOSTILE 
TO LOW-INCOME WORKERS. 
</P>

<P>
 Senate Democrats heeded the pleas of organized labor Wednesday and rejected 
the reappointment of Gov. Pete Wilson's candidate to the agency that sets the 
state's minimum wage. 
</P>
<P>
 On a party-line vote, the three Democrats on the Senate Rules Committee 
prevailed over the committee's two Republicans to scuttle the confirmation of 
Lynnel Pollock, who was seeking a third term on the state Industrial Welfare 
Commission as a representative of employers. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollock, a Yolo County Republican and grain and walnut farmer, drew strong 
support from the California business community, including manufacturers, 
farmers, truckers, restaurant operators, and the hotel and motel industry. 
</P>
<P>
 But organized labor, led by John Henning, secretary-treasurer of the 
California Federation of Labor, AFL-CIO, attacked Pollock as hostile to 
low-income workers for opposing increases in the minimum wage during her 11 
years on the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 J. P. Tremblay, a spokesman for Wilson, said it was "unfortunate" that 
Democrats rejected Pollock, especially after the Senate had twice previously 
confirmed her for the post. "Nothing's changed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the committee hearing room, Henning and other labor representatives 
were clearly happy with their victory as the election-year legislative session 
gets under way. Tremblay said it was too early to say whether other Wilson 
appointees to politically sensitive posts might face similar trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1988, the California minimum wage has been $4.25 an hour. Pollock told 
the Rules Committee she voted once, in 1987, to increase the minimum level to 
$4 an hour but was outvoted when other commissioners favored the higher $4.25 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that during tough economic times employers could not afford to pay 
higher wages. 
</P>
<P>
 Henning told the committee that Pollock was insensitive to low-wage employees 
and asserted that rather than increasing the minimum wage, she favored 
diverting such workers into "welfare dependents." 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning by committee members, Pollock conceded that many low-income 
workers with large families and limited skills are "hurting" but suggested that 
government programs such as job training and Aid to Families With Dependent 
Children are available to them. 
</P>
<P>
 Henning said that the commission's support of the 12-hour workday in 
California puts a hardship on single mothers and places "their kids on the 
streets at night." Pollock countered that flexible hours such as a 12-hour 
workday often are demanded by employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate leader David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) told Pollock that her record on 
supporting minimum wage increases was "just too meager" for him to support her 
for another term. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the part-time commission are paid $100 per meeting and expenses.

PANEL CALLS FOR PRE-BALLOT INITIATIVE VOTE; ELECTIONS: COMMISSION RECOMMENDS 
THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER PROPOSED MEASURES BEFORE THEY GO TO VOTERS. ONLY 
LOSING ISSUES WOULD THEN GO TO THE GENERAL ELECTORATE FOR A DECISION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A prestigious commission called Wednesday for significant changes in the 
initiative process, recommending that the Legislature be required to vote on 
proposed ballot measures before they are placed on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 If lawmakers approve them, such measures would become law without being on the 
ballot. Those measures rejected by the Legislature would go on the statewide 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission, headed by former Legislative Analyst A. Alan Post, also 
recommended that lawmakers be free to make changes to the proposed initiatives, 
so long as the proponents agree. Initiatives would still have to qualify by 
signature petitions as they do now. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Jim Costa (D-Fresno) said he intends to put the recommendations 
into the form of bills to be considered by the Legislature this year. Some of 
the changes would have to be approved by voters on a statewide ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa carried legislation creating the commission in 1992 following elections 
in 1988 and 1990 when California voters were called upon to decide the fate of 
a total of 36 citizen-generated initiatives. At the time, he argued that the 
initiative process had "run amok" and become dominated by special interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the commission included several promoters, consultants and lawyers 
involved in the initiative industry. Given their support of the panel's report, 
at least some of the recommendations may have a strong chance of becoming law. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Miller, chief deputy secretary of state and a member of the panel, lauded 
the report but said it should have gone further by requiring that major

 Miller called on the Legislature to enact a "a truth-in-advertising 
provision," adding that "it's the most important thing the Legislature could do 
to reform this process." 
</P>
<P>
 Post, who was legislative analyst for more than 20 years, and the other 
commissioners called for additional disclosure of contributions to initiatives, 
and for more readable and informative voter pamphlets. As part of the 
additional information, legislators' votes on the initiatives would be printed 
in voter handbooks, which are mailed to all registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
 To make it easier for initiative promoters to get their measures on the 
ballot, the commission recommended that proponents have 180 days to gather the 
requisite number of signatures, rather than the current 150 days.

MORE VIOLENCE SEEN IN SCHOOLS THAN 5 YEARS AGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Violence in schools is a more acute problem than it was five years ago -- a 
result, primarily, of the breakdown of the family and the portrayal of violence 
by the media, according to 700 of the nation's school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcohol and drug abuse, poverty and easy access to guns were cited as other 
major causes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that we have solid information on the causes, we must take up the 
difficult task of working with federal and state government, parent groups, the 
business community and the media in finding solutions," said William Soult, 
head of the National School Boards Assn., which did the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-nine percent of responding urban districts reported a shooting or 
knifing in schools last year, and 23% reported drive-by shootings. While the 
reports of violence were highest in urban districts, both suburban and rural 
districts reported increases in the number and seriousness of violent 
incidents, including rapes and shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 "This report clearly shows that the concern about violence in our nation's 
schools now extends to all communities -- urban, suburban and rural," Education 
Secretary Richard W. Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventy-seven percent of the responding districts said that "changing family 
situations" -- including everything from children living in poverty to a lack 
of supervision in upper-income families -- is the primary cause of violence. 
Sixty percent blamed the violence on the media. 
</P>
<P>
 The association sent surveys to more than 2,000 organizations and received 
responses from 700. 
</P>
<P>
 "A broad spectrum of rural, urban and suburban districts responded," said John 
Butler a spokesman for the association. "So it gives you a pretty good idea of 
what is going on." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to deter violence, school districts have used an array of 
tactics: suspending students, increasing police presence on campuses, teaching 
students alternative ways of handling conflicts and setting up separate schools 
for disruptive students. Thirty-nine percent of urban and 10% of suburban 
school districts said that they used metal detectors, and 19% of urban and 11% 
of suburban school districts said that they had installed closed-circuit 
television cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 In one innovative approach, the Broward County, Fla., school board hired a 
former New York City gang member to work with teachers, parents and students to 
discourage children from joining gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 The report said that legislative remedies, at the federal and local level, are 
essential if the problem is to be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has called on Congress to pass legislation that 
would provide money to school districts facing severe crime and violence 
problems. The National School Boards Assn. applauded the measure in its report.

BLACK WOMEN ASK RETAILER NOT TO SELL 'GANGSTA RAP' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A prominent black women's group stepped up its campaign against "gangsta rap" 
music Wednesday, calling on Sam Goody, the nation's largest music and video 
retailer, to stop selling the work of artists whose lyrics glorify violence and 
denigrate women. 
</P>
<P>
 C. Delores Tucker, chairwoman of the National Political Congress of Black 
Women, said her organization targeted Sam Goody because of its prominence as a 
national chain and because of its high volume of "gangsta rap" sales in the 
nation's capital.She said the protest -- in which members marched in front of a 
local Sam Goody store -- would be expanded over the next 10 days and continue 
until the company, and others, comply. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Sam Goody's parent firm, Musicland Group, said the company 
believes that it has gone as far as it can to address concerns about violent 
and misogynist lyrics by placing parental warnings on some of the recordings in 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 "While many of the recordings we don't like ourselves, we don't want to set 
ourselves up as censors for what the public can or cannot buy," said Marsha 
Apple, vice president of communications for Musicland Group. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the group -- which offers support to black women congressional 
candidates -- conveyed its concerns to The Wiz record stores in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our children should be enjoying their childhoods instead of dodging bullets, 
planning their funerals and counting the numbers of relatives and friends who 
have died or been injured through violence in the streets," Tucker said. "The 
continued dehumanization and negative depiction of women subjects our young 
people to offensive images that destroy their spirits."

2 MARINES ARE DISCHARGED FOR POSING NUDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Marines have been discharged and three more might be discharged for 
allegedly posing nude for a man who says he ran a gay pornography ring, Camp 
Pendleton officials announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 10 enlisted Marines are accused of involvement with Luciano Ceballos, 
a convicted forger who has been in the Metropolitan Correctional Center in San 
Diego since September on a parole violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Military investigators accused all 10 of posing nude, a violation of military 
law, but none is accused of engaging in sexual acts with others. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 10, two were discharged, three are undergoing proceedings that could 
result in discharges, one was discharged for unrelated misconduct, one received 
administrative punishment and two are awaiting a decision on possible 
punishment, the Marine Corps said. The status of the 10th was not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marine Corps released a statement detailing the status of the nine Marines 
after they issued an incorrect statement Tuesday that all nine had been given 
general discharges, a step below an honorable discharge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marine Corps began an investigation into possible Marine involvement in a 
gay pornography ring after Ceballos boasted to reporters last summer that 500 
Marines from Camp Pendleton were involved in his mail-order pornography 
business. Investigators seized videotapes and a photo album with several 
hundred Polaroid pictures of naked and partially clothed men.

ACCUSED EMBEZZLER SAYS HE'S SCAPEGOAT FOR OTHERS; TRIAL: EX-DIRECTOR FOR IRVINE 
HOUSING PROGRAM CONCEDES HE MADE MISTAKES, BUT ONLY TO KEEP CHARITY AFLOAT. 
PROSECUTORS DESCRIBE CLYDE WEINMAN AS A MAN WHO STOLE FROM POOR TO BANKROLL A 
LAVISH LIFESTYLE. 
</P>

<P>
 Facing charges that he embezzled money meant for the homeless, Clyde E. 
Weinman admitted Wednesday that he has made mistakes but insisted that he has 
become the scapegoat for those who mismanaged the charity.  
</P>
<P>
 "If I had to do things over again, I would do it differently, but now I'm 
facing jail, financial ruin, being stripped of my kids -- all for something I 
believe in my heart was right," Weinman said as he sat in his kitchen, 
surrounded by his wife and two children. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinman, 44, former executive director at Irvine Temporary Housing, a charity 
for the homeless, is on trial in Orange County Superior Court on charges that 
he forged several hundred checks, totaling about $400,000. Closing arguments 
are scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors depict Weinman as a reverse Robin Hood -- a man who stole from the 
poor to pay for a posh home and fancy car. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all went for him to live a lavish lifestyle," Deputy Dist. Atty. William 
Overtoom said Wednesday. "These people don't have a home, but he's driving a 
Mercedes-Benz. In all my years of doing this, I have to say this is one of the 
lowest of the low. Never have I run into a case where a guy is as vile as this, 
low enough to steal from the homeless." 
</P>
<P>
 But Weinman insisted that he put nearly $65,000 of his own money -- including 
his wife's paychecks from teaching, even his children's savings account -- to 
help keep Irvine Temporary Housing afloat. He ran into trouble while forging 
checks to himself to cover his own bills, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As tears welled, Weinman denied any wrongdoing Wednesday and contended that he 
has been victimized by a poorly run charity that needed to blame someone for 
its financial straits and persistent funding shortfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a scapegoat for all of this," said Weinman, who faces 13 forgery and 
grand-theft charges. Weinman, who is free on bail, could face eight years in 
prison and $200,000 in fines if convicted, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinman acknowledges that his unorthodox methods were inappropriate, and 
forging checks was wrong, but said he never improperly gained financially from 
his job. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Temporary Housing was created in 1985 to find shelter for the homeless 
in the Irvine area. The agency experienced a setback after the scandal broke, 
but continues to work to help the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have alleged that Weinman ran a high stakes "Ponzi scheme," 
putting just enough money into the bank to cover the agency's bills and 
altering the books to hide the truth from co-workers who trusted him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Weinman lied to everyone. He pulled the wool over everyone's eyes," 
Overtoom said. 
</P>
<P>
 The lifestyle Weinman led would have been difficult on his $30,000-a-year 
salary, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Using embezzled money, Weinman turned his Irvine home into a virtual "Taj 
Mahal" that included a pool, sauna and lavish landscaping, Overtoom said. 
Weinman also leased a luxury car and had a ready supply of spending money, the 
prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinman strongly denies the charges. He said he is a handyman who enjoys 
working around the house, and says many of the renovations were made before he 
started working for the agency.  
</P>
<P>
 Weinman's arrest in November, 1992, sent shock waves through charity circles 
in Orange County. Neighbors, former co-workers and others said they could not 
believe that Weinman, who had seemingly dedicated his career to helping the 
needy, could be guilty of such crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters say Weinman always went beyond the call of duty, combing local 
parks to find those in need, never thinking twice about lending a homeless 
person cash or finding them food. He once arranged for a free ride for a person 
who had been severely injured in an out-of-state accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Temporary Housing is not the first to allege misconduct against 
Weinman. While working at a poverty law center in Los Angeles, a co-worker has 
alleged that Weinman siphoned funds. Weinman, who denied any involvement and 
has not been charged in that case, contended that the co-worker -- who was 
later convicted -- was trying to blame Weinman for the misconduct to save 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinman said he made the strategic decision not to testify on his own behalf 
for fear that the Los Angeles case would emerge before the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I ever really wanted to do in my adult life was to help the homeless and 
the disabled," Weinman said. "My heart was dedicated to doing this. I just 
can't believe that you can go to jail for something that you believed was 
right."

BERGESON, STATE PANEL TALK BEACH CURFEW COMPROMISE; POLITICS: SENATOR AND 
COASTAL COMMISSION BOTH SAY DEAL APPEARS DOABLE. IT MUST BALANCE CITIES' SAFETY 
CONCERNS AND AGENCY'S DESIRE FOR FREE PUBLIC ACCESS. 
</P>

 Breaking the ice in a testy dispute between cities and the state over beach 
curfews, state Sen. Marian Bergeson met with California Coastal Commission 
officials Wednesday to seek a compromise that could allow cities to continue 
the nightly closures. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no agreements were reached during the 45-minute meeting at Bergeson's 
Capitol office, the Newport Beach Republican and commission officials agreed to 
meet again in Orange County on Jan. 28 with disgruntled local officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a good exchange," said Bergeson, who has promised to introduce 
legislation if the matter can't be resolved through negotiations. "They 
appeared very willing to work toward a solution or better understanding." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Douglas, commission executive director, also expressed confidence that 
an agreement can be reached balancing the concerns of local officials -- who 
are hard-pressed to finance nightly patrols to ensure public safety -- and the 
desires of coastal officials to keep the shoreline open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was very forceful with her defense of home rule and trying to meet public 
safety needs in a time of strapped budgets," said Douglas, who attended the 
meeting with commission Chairman Thomas W. Gwyn. "She understands our concerns 
about public access. . . . We made the point that these are solvable issues and 
that it's not the kind of thing that needs legislation." 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute was sparked after the commission dispatched a letter in October to 
73 cities and counties along the state's 1,100-mile coastline -- including four 
Orange County communities that have imposed curfews this year in fear of 
late-night crime -- indicating that such closures are illegal without state 
approval. The letter also suggested that state approval of any ongoing closures 
would not be forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 City and county officials in Orange County and elsewhere were upset that the 
commission might try to override their ability to curb shoreline crime by 
limiting access during late-night hours. Commission officials have historically 
refused to approve any request to close beaches to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Although state officials said they felt the curfews were illegal under the 
state Coastal Act, no effort has been made to override the locally approved 
closures. Douglas has said in the past, however, that each local government 
might have to apply for a permit in order to keep enforcing the curfews. 
</P>
<P>
 Tight budgets, as well as a spate of drunken brawls and a few shootings, 
prompted the state Department of Parks and Recreation to impose a curfew at 
state beaches in Orange County last April, rolling back its closing hours from 
midnight to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The cities of Huntington Beach, Newport Beach and Seal Beach, which had 
curfews of 11 p.m. or midnight, promptly followed, fearing that those turned 
away from the state beaches might just move down the sand. 
</P>
<P>
 While those curfews were not challenged, the commission has acted in some 
cases to thwart stricter restrictions. Long Beach, for instance, had closed its 
beaches at midnight since the 1950s, but last year when it imposed a tougher 
curfew -- from 10 p.m. to 5 a.m. -- the move was rejected by the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to complaints from Bergeson, the commission has been buffeted by 
criticism from Gov. Pete Wilson, who railed against the state agency at the end 
of a well-attended press conference last week. 
</P>
<P>
 During the meeting Wednesday, Douglas said, "we made it very clear it's not an 
issue of public safety or public access -- it's both. . . . I thought it was a 
very positive meeting. We got the message." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 28 session will take place in Huntington Beach and will include local 
officials, law enforcement representatives, legislators and members of the 
Coastal Commission. Douglas said he also plans to discuss curfews during next 
week's commission meeting in Santa Barbara. Local officials also will have an 
opportunity to address the commission during that meeting, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But should no compromise emerge in the coming weeks, Bergeson said, she is 
ready to introduce a bill restricting the role of the commission when it comes 
to curfews. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't quarrel with the fact the public should have access to beaches," 
Bergeson said. "The question is, when does that access conflict with public 
safety? I think local officials are better able than a state agency to make 
such a determination about something going on in their own back yards." 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials in Orange County were pleased that headway is being made. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry L. Bankston, Seal Beach city manager, said the negotiations are "very 
welcome news and really puts us as a coastal city in a non-emotional position 
and better able to deal with this." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the beach city would continue to argue that a local jurisdiction is 
best capable of assessing police calls, violent incidents at the beach and 
those affecting beaches in neighboring cities. Police calls for service around 
the city's pier area have decreased, Bankston said, in part because of a beach 
curfew the city imposed last year closing the beaches from 10 p.m. to 4:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hope not to go through a protracted hearing application process just 
to have our curfew approved," Bankston said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Huntington Beach, Mayor Linda Moulton-Patterson, who is on the 12-member 
state Coastal Commission, said she interpreted Douglas' meeting as a positive 
sign for Orange County coastal cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really think the commission staff needs to hear about some of our local 
problems and hear about local control," Moulton-Patterson said. "If you're 
balancing public safety with right to public access, you really need public 
safety to win out."

DISCARDED INFANT GIVEN BURIAL; CHARITY: GROUP FOUNDED BY BREA PAIR PROVIDES 
FUNERALS FOR ABANDONED OR INDIGENT BABIES. BODY OF GIRL WAS LEFT IN DUMPSTER BY 
HER MOTHER.

<P>
 A baby girl who died just after her birth last October and was discarded in a 
Dumpster was given a Catholic funeral Wednesday, the first of its kind in 
Orange County arranged by the nonprofit group Child Rest in Peace. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization, which previously provided burial services for 12 abandoned 
or indigent children in Los Angeles County, was founded by a Brea couple upset 
to learn that the remains of abandoned babies were routinely cremated by county 
officials, then placed in common graves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just wanted to give them a decent funeral service," said Rosabelia Horton, 
who founded the group with her husband in 1991. "We just wanted to show that 
they aren't completely abandoned." 
</P>
<P>
 Only Horton and the funeral director, Gus McAulay, attended the burial of baby 
Veronica, who was named shortly before Christmas at Horton's urging. The 
child's mother, Veronica Aguilar Gonzalez of Costa Mesa, had planned to attend 
the funeral but stayed away, apparently because she had learned that reporters 
and photographers would be present, her attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar Gonzalez, who faces a misdemeanor charge of illegally discarding the 
infant's body in a Newport Beach trash receptacle three days after she gave 
birth alone in her home, could not be reached for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's just scared and embarrassed about all this," said Shelly Aronson, 
Aguilar Gonzalez's public defender. "When she got out of jail, all these 
reporters were there pushing cameras in her face and she was very upset. I'm 
sure that's why she decided not to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar Gonzalez, 26, was arrested on suspicion of manslaughter after the 
child's body was discovered in early November at an Irvine trash transfer 
station. But she was later charged only with the misdemeanor of improperly 
disposing of human and fetal remains. 
</P>
<P>
 A coroner's report determined that the baby had died of "fetal asphyxia due to 
aspirated amniotic fluid." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Lance Jensen said Aguilar Gonzalez is expected to plead 
guilty to the misdemeanor charge at a hearing Wednesday. At most, he said, she 
will spend 30 days in jail. But Jensen said he will also recommend that Aguilar 
Gonzalez be placed on probation and ordered to attend parenting classes. She 
already has spent 11 days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Holy Sepulcher Cemetery in Orange on Wednesday, Father Jose Mendez 
conducted the service standing near a tiny casket covered in white satin and 
topped with a gold-toned crucifix and yellow, pink and lavender blossoms. 
</P>
<P>
 The priest, who was asked to officiate because the mother said she was a 
member of his church, Our Lady of Guadalupe in Santa Ana, prayed that the baby 
will enjoy peaceful rest and eternal life. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendez made the sign of the cross over the casket. Horton and McAulay, of 
Fairhaven Memorial Park, which donated the mortuary services, chatted briefly, 
then drifted away. 
</P>
<P>
 In describing the circumstances of the baby's birth, Aronson, the public 
defender, painted a picture of a confused young woman who was embarrassed by 
her pregnancy and had managed to conceal it from almost everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar Gonzalez had planned to return home to Mexico to deliver the baby, but 
went into labor several weeks early on Oct. 31, and gave birth alone in the 
Costa Mesa apartment she shared with several acquaintances, the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the infant did not start breathing, Aronson said, Aguilar Gonzalez shook 
it, then panicked. 
</P>
<P>
 "She couldn't get it to breathe, then was scared to death, thinking that 
somebody would blame her. She didn't know what to do," Aronson said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Aronson and prosecutors, Aguilar Gonzalez hid the baby's body in 
her apartment for several days, then wrapped it in a plastic bag and carried it 
on the bus on her way to work as a housekeeper and nanny in Newport Beach. She 
discarded the body in a trash bin behind a Newport Beach apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "This woman is a reliable worker who is great with kids and is very 
responsible in other respects," Aronson said. "This is so out of character for 
her. She's very responsible and dependable. She's just a girl who made a big 
mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 Jensen sees the situation differently, although he agreed there was no 
evidence that the child had died of anything other than natural causes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel she's a very selfish individual who was concerned about her own health 
and went to the hospital to deal with some bleeding, leaving a dead baby in a 
hamper for three days while she went on about her life," the prosecutor said.

 Aguilar Gonzalez was arrested after news reports of the baby's body being 
discovered jarred the memory of a doctor at Hoag Hospital who had treated the 
woman for bleeding she claimed was the result of a miscarriage, Jensen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Horton said she decided to try to arrange the funeral after reading news 
reports about the baby's body being discovered. Even though Child Rest in Peace 
had never before held a service for a child found outside Los Angeles County, 
Horton said the circumstances were of the same sort that moved her to start the 
group two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think every child should have a funeral, even though I'm not very 
religious," she said. "It just didn't seem right to me that they were being put 
in a mass grave." 
</P>
<P>
 Horton said she and her husband, who own a Santa Fe Springs carpet 
installation company, have received enough donations to date to pay for all the 
funerals, including the grave sites and mortuary services. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this case, I'm trying hard not to be judgmental," she said. "I talked with 
(Aguilar Gonzalez) once and think she just had no conscience maybe. Or maybe 
she was so distraught she just wasn't thinking clearly. Who knows?"

UCI POLICE OFFICER ACCUSED IN THEFT OF CAMPUS EQUIPMENT; BURGLARY: SCOTT ERIC 
ROBERTS, WHO WAS FIRED DEC. 20, FACES FELONY CHARGES THAT OVER THREE YEARS HE 
STOLE HIGH-TECH ITEMS. HE PLANS TO PLEAD NOT GUILTY.

 A UC Irvine police officer faces 17 felony charges that he stole computers and 
other high-tech equipment from campus buildings and a student's dorm room, the 
Orange County district attorney's office announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Eric Roberts, 34, who joined the university Police Department in 1984, 
was fired on Dec. 20 because of the criminal investigation. He has until Friday 
to post $10,000 bail or surrender at the Orange County Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney John Barnett said Roberts would post bail and plead not 
guilty to all the charges at his arraignment on Jan. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts, who lives with his wife and children in Trabuco Canyon, could face up 
to 11 years in state prison if convicted. He could not be reached for comment 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very much of a shock and it's very disappointing," said UCI's assistant 
police chief, Dennis Powers.  
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who's entrusted to protect somebody, and you find out they're 
actually a violator, the public (is) outraged at that behavior," said Powers, 
who described Roberts as a trusted employee. "(But) the men and women of our 
department, they work hard and they're very concerned about their reputation in 
the community. Something like this sets us back. . . . It is devastating." 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation began in October when a UCI computer turned up at Cal State 
Fullerton and officers traced it to a person who said he bought it from 
Roberts, Powers said. While UCI police and the district attorney's office 
conducted a joint investigation, Roberts was placed on paid leave immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation is still continuing, but the current charges date back to 
January, 1991, when Roberts allegedly stole a cellular telephone from a student 
dormitory during winter vacation, Deputy Dist. Atty. Randy Pawloski said. In 
the three years since, prosecutors contend, Roberts has stolen a variety of 
computer parts, portable radios, stereo speakers, videocassette recorders and 
an electric typewriter from classroom and administrative buildings around the 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Powers said investigators had recovered about $20,000 in stolen property so 
far. All the alleged burglaries were "no force" or "key entry" jobs, leading 
police to believe they were committed by a university insider, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 With 23 sworn officers, UCI's police force functions much like a municipal 
department. Roberts worked on the patrol division, and had the rank of 
corporal, or senior officer. 
</P>
<P>
 In the university's 29-year history, Roberts is the first officer to be 
arrested for any type of criminal activity, UCI spokeswoman Karen Newell Young 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're never happy with equipment theft, but were pleased that the joint 
investigation has led to an arrest," Young said. "We anticipate that the campus 
will be able to recover some of this equipment." 
</P>
<P>
 Burglary has plagued the campus for years. In 1989, four students were 
expelled and sentenced to five years' probation for a string of 14 heists in 
which $120,000 worth of computers were taken. Later that year, a series of 20 
break-ins left the university with $80,000 worth of missing high-tech 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Computer theft "is an ongoing problem and every university has it," Powers 
said. "In a university-type of setting, a lot of your thefts are open-door or 
key-entry." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the burglary charges, Roberts faces felony counts of possession 
and selling stolen goods. He is also charged with possessing nunchakus and a 
small amount of marijuana, both of which were discovered during a search of his 
home on Dec. 6, Pawloski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Pawloski and Powers said they expect more charges to be filed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The investigation isn't near completion," Powers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts turned himself in late Tuesday afternoon and appeared in Newport Beach 
Municipal Court, where Judge Craig Edward Robison scheduled the arraignment for 
Jan. 10 and gave Roberts until Friday to post bail or surrender.

BUNNIES NEED HOMES; RESTAURANT RABBITS HAVE MULTIPLIED, MUST GO FORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 On Wednesday afternoon, Marla Behm was on her knees in the grass outside El 
Torito Restaurant and Cantina, coaxing four rabbits to eat some lettuce from 
her hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love them," said Behm, of Fullerton, who frequents the restaurant so she 
can watch the rabbits while she eats. "I give them all my leftovers, my hors 
d'oeuvres too. They eat anything. Even tortilla chips." 
</P>
<P>
 But for Behm and other customers who love El Torito's rabbits, it may soon be 
a case of hare today, gone tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 The domestic rabbits, some abandoned by their owners and others born at the 
site, have lived for years in burrows in a hilly, shaded greenbelt area at 
Katella Avenue and State College Boulevard that separates the El Torito -- 
formerly a Casa Maria -- from a Charley Brown's restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Over time, they have become a mealtime attraction. The rabbits are so 
accustomed to being fed by restaurant patrons that they approach customers at 
patio tables. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent months, the rabbit population has exploded, putting the furry 
animals in danger from malnutrition, disease and motorists. Drivers have run 
over several of the creatures in the restaurant parking lot and nearby streets, 
said Lt. Marie Hulett-Curtner, public education officer and spokeswoman for 
Orange County Animal Control. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hope of finding homes for the estimated 75 rabbits, the management of 
the restaurants, animal control officials and the nonprofit House Rabbit 
Society have begun an adoption program -- much to the dismay of some restaurant 
patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they should leave some of them here to keep the atmosphere," said Tom 
Hruden, an Anaheim businessman who lunches at El Torito frequently. "But they 
should let people take (some of) them as pets when they're young." 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Buckley and Clydora White said they always choose a window table in the 
bar so they can watch the rabbits. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why we come here. We enjoy watching them," said Buckley, who works 
nearby and believes the rabbits should be left alone. "I've had rabbits at 
home. But here they have a place to be free." 
</P>
<P>
 The rabbits don't pose a public health risk, Hulett-Curtner said, but don't 
fare well on the diet that the restaurant's customers and employees offer them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rabbits don't live a very good life at the restaurant," she said. "People 
think it's OK to abandon them. But they're dying of disease and malnutrition. 
They're domesticated animals and they can't care for themselves. They need real 
homes." 
</P>
<P>
 With no one willing to assume responsibility for the rabbits' welfare, the 
adoption program is the only option, Hulett-Curtner said. A spokeswoman for El 
Torito Restaurants Inc. said there are too many rabbits for the restaurant to 
care for. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs will be posted later this week warning people against abandoning their 
pets, which is a misdemeanor, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rabbit population can be expected to keep growing, because rabbits can 
reproduce like, well, rabbits -- every 28 to 32 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie Gigous, co-manager of the 250-member House Rabbit chapter here, said 
the group is looking for bunny lovers willing to treat the rabbits as house 
pets. People wishing to adopt the rabbits will be screened by the society. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to find homes to conform to what we think they should have. You 
want the best for them," she said. "We don't want the bunny put in a back-yard 
hutch with food and water." 
</P>
<P>
 Gigous said the rabbits should be removed because they're not getting proper 
food and care. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any domestic pet cannot be let go and be expected to survive," she said. 
"They're used to people taking care of them." 
</P>
<P>
 The society hopes to take in some rabbits, have them spayed or neutered and 
house-trained, and placed in foster homes until they are adopted, said Laura 
Shortall, the chapter's manager. The group charges a $35 fee to cover the costs 
of that program, Shortall said. 
</P>
<P>
 But people unwilling to adopt rabbits via that program will be given them free 
of charge, along with information on house training and caring for a rabbit 
themselves, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 El Torito patron Paul Partaine, who works in Anaheim, said he favors the 
adoption program. "It's no point to see them hit by a car," he said. "And it's 
not too appetizing to walk up to the restaurant if you see one get hit." 
</P>
<P>
 But restaurant patrons such as Buckley and White say they won't come back if 
the rabbits disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably won't come here to eat," White said. "They'll lose two good 
customers," White said.

GIFT OF LAND BY NICHOLSON IS REPORTED; PARKS: SIXTY ACRES IN THE SANTA MONICAS 
WILL JOIN MOUNTAIN PRESERVE. THE PARCEL IS EAST OF THE SAN DIEGO FREEWAY. 
</P>

<P>
 The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy has received a gift of 60 acres of 
parkland in the hills above Studio City from film star Jack Nicholson, sources 
familiar with the transaction said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although conservancy officials would not name the donor, they described the 
land as "the most significant stretch of undeveloped ridgeline" between 
Mulholland Drive and Ventura Boulevard east of the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can say is it was an anonymous donation by a generous benefactor," said 
Joseph T. Edmiston, the conservancy's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 But Turnley Walker, chairman of the Longridge-Alomar Neighborhood Committee, 
which is active in preservation efforts in the area, said the donor is 
Nicholson, as did a second source familiar with the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson's business manager declined comment when asked the source of the 
gift. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the parcel, which includes frontage on the north side of 
Mulholland and the west side of Coldwater Canyon Avenue, features an extensive 
native oak woodland and is habitat for deer. 
</P>
<P>
 It borders other tracts the conservancy has purchased or is trying to acquire 
in a continuing effort to preserve a continuous swath of wild-land habitat 
linking Griffith Park on the east to Topanga State Park on the west. 
</P>
<P>
 John A. Diaz, land acquisition chief for the conservancy, said a four-lot 
subdivision had been approved for the property, but that it "will now be 
available for all of the public to enjoy for all time." 
</P>
<P>
 Word of Nicholson's involvement will only enhance the conservancy's budding 
reputation as park agency to the stars. A state parks agency that acquires land 
in the Santa Monicas and neighboring ranges, including the Simi Hills and Santa 
Susana Mountains, the conservancy announced in November that entertainer Barbra 
Streisand was giving it her Malibu estate for use as an environmental research 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, actors Warren Beatty and Peter Strauss and singer-songwriter Don 
Henley aided conservancy acquisitions. The agency last month got a film and 
television star on its board when Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan named Ed 
Begley Jr. to represent the city on the eight-member panel.

AVIATORS' OASIS; A DESERT AIRPORT -- THE REALIZATION OF A MAN'S DREAM -- CATERS 
TO ULTRA-LIGHT CRAFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Picture a man who almost single-handedly built an airport in a remote part of 
the Mojave Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 He carved a landing strip into the brush- and rock-covered land, erected a 
couple of hangars and lives out there -- at the end of a dirt road not even in 
the Thomas Guide -- in a trailer with his dog, Shadow. 
</P>
<P>
 The man you have pictured probably does not resemble Jack Brian, the founder 
and proprietor of Brian Ranch Airport in Llano, a haven in the Antelope Valley 
for the growing sport of ultra-light airplane flying. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian, 67, is soft-spoken and gentle in manner. And he is a man who always, 
when working around the airport, wears a necktie. Always. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when he is alone except for Shadow (whom he dresses in a sweater when the 
weather turns cold). Even when he is standing out in the hot desert sun, using 
a welding torch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel naked without a tie," he said almost apologetically, putting down the 
torch to take a break. Brian was welding together metal parts for a cart to be 
used to move ultra-lights in and out of the hangars. His tie, faded from years 
of wear, featured red and blue diagonal stripes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Old habits die hard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian is not eccentric. He's British. 
</P>
<P>
 He got in the habit of wearing a tie as a young man while working for the 
famed Royal Aircraft Establishment, the major research and development center 
for the Royal Air Force. 
</P>
<P>
 "They would send you home if you didn't dress properly," he said in a lilting 
accent. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian's gentility and friendliness sets the tone at the airport, even though 
ultra-light pilots -- who do not need a license to fly the lightweight vehicles 
that started out as motorized hang gliders -- have a reputation as the 
rough-and-ready daredevils of contemporary aviation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is very different from what people might expect out here," pilot Bob 
Comperini of Palmdale said just before starting the engine of his airplane. 
</P>
<P>
 Comperini does this by pulling on a handle, like a suburbanite starting his 
lawn mower. 
</P>
<P>
 "The accent, the tie," Comperini continues over the roar of the 76-horsepower 
motor. "But look what he has done. He has made a great place for us." 
</P>
<P>
 The remoteness of the site is perfect for ultra-light flying. 
</P>
<P>
 "In these airplanes, you should never fly over anything you are not willing to 
land on," said Mark Sult, a pilot certified to teach ultra-light flying. 
Standing on the edge of one of the airstrips, Sult pointed in several 
directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the house of a neighbor about a mile away, the nearest buildings 
were far in the distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Federal Aviation Administration regulations, ultra-lights are to be 
flown strictly for recreation. With an imposed gas tank limit of five gallons, 
a cruising speed of about 40 m.p.h. and a prohibition against their use over 
populated areas or at night, the aircraft are hardly utilitarian. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is strictly for fun," said Larry Harvey, 49, who works as an air traffic 
controller at Palmdale Airport and is learning to fly ultra-lights. He had just 
come down from a training flight in a two-seater that Sult uses for 
instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "You really get the experience of flying," Harvey said, "like back in the old 
stick-and-rudder days." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the bad reputation ultra-lights have, pilots at the airport bring 
up safety about as often as they talk about their hatred of government aviation 
regulations. But that doesn't keep them from having some old-fashioned, 
barnstorming fun. 
</P>
<P>
 On a slow Sunday recently, when a spate of especially cold weather kept away 
all but the most die-hard pilots, Sult and Comperini played a game in which one 
of them tossed out a roll of toilet paper while in flight. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they swooped down, trying to catch some of the paper as it unfurled 
downward. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian watched the two pilots at play. "Where there are other airplanes around, 
you can't do something like this," he said, smiling. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultra-lights were not what Brian had in mind when he planned his airport in 
the 1970s. At the time, he was a senior scientist with Hughes Aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had always wanted to have a small airport for a group of people I like," 
said Brian, settling into an easy chair in the sparsely furnished trailer. "I 
wanted a flying club, a nice place for general aviation." 
</P>
<P>
 General aviation pilots are licensed to fly small, private planes. Brian had 
been flying these kinds of planes since 1958. He previously was a pilot of 
larger, military planes during his Royal Air Force stint. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian came to the United States to pursue a career as an engineer. At Hughes 
he oversaw a team that developed components for space shuttle communications. 
</P>
<P>
 While at Hughes, he and his wife, Beryl, often took weekend car trips to look 
for their dream airport site. In 1978, they bought 36 acres near Llano, about 
20 miles east of Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked this spot because it was flat and at 3,000 feet elevation, the 
temperatures were just about right," Brian said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1980s the Los Angeles County Regional Planning Commission granted 
him permission to build a public airport there. 
</P>
<P>
 But his dream changed as the years went on. In the fall of 1987, Beryl died of 
cancer. He hired an airplane to skywrite "Goodby Beryl" over the Rose Parade on 
the New Year's Day that followed. 
</P>
<P>
 And general aviation had changed. Because of increasing aircraft and insurance 
prices, it was too expensive for all but a handful of people who dreamed of 
becoming pilots. Pilots also complained about the growing commercial air 
traffic in urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultra-light aircraft was, for those who wanted to avoid the big-ticket items 
and regulations, a way to fulfill their desire to fly. 
</P>
<P>
 But first the sport had to go through some rocky years. "The equipment was not 
so sophisticated in the early days," said Peter Klein, a Palmdale automobile 
mechanic who started flying ultra-lights in the early 1980s. "There were no 
gauges, there was a lot of experimentation." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was new and there were a lot of hot-doggers who were crazy," Klein said. 
"They did not know how to take care of the aircraft. They thought they could 
just do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 As the aircraft became sturdier and more airworthy, a national association of 
ultra-light pilots set the standard for training. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are still fatal accidents. Last year in Sonoma County, two men died when 
their newly purchased ultra-light crashed into a hillside. In 1992, a Camarillo 
man died when his aircraft went down in a strawberry field while he was 
practicing forced stalls. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, a Kern County man was killed when his ultra-light struck the guy 
wire of a radio tower. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can never forget that these are actual airplanes," Comperini said. "If 
you don't pay attention or know what you are doing, you can get into trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago Brian retired from Hughes and moved to the airport to work on it 
full time. By then, he saw that his business would center on ultra-lights. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always stress safety," he said, and there have been no injury-causing 
accidents at his airport. Partly because of the safety record, he got 
permission in 1992 from the planning commission to house up to 30 ultra-lights 
on the property. He charges owners $60 a month for hangar space. At the moment, 
he has about a dozen signed up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't make money, yet, but if we hit 30 we will break even," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brain has started renovating one of the hangars to make it a pilots lounge. 
"It will be a nice place for pilots to fly in from all around here, have a cup 
of coffee, sit and talk," he said. "And we very badly need bathrooms out here."

FAILURE OF MARS PROBE BLAMED ON FUEL LEAK; SPACE: A FEDERAL PANEL INVESTIGATING 
THE ILL-FATED MISSION ALSO CITES SLOPPY WORKMANSHIP AND CRITICIZES JPL 
MANAGEMENT OF THE PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal panel investigating the disappearance of NASA's Mars Observer space 
probe concluded Wednesday that the spacecraft leaked enough fuel -- barely two 
tablespoonfuls -- to cause an explosion, knocking the first U.S. mission to 
Mars in 17 years out of contact with Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel of NASA-appointed experts, which has conducted an exhaustive review 
of the project since the spacecraft vanished Aug. 21, also cited evidence of 
sloppy workmanship and criticized management at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory, 
which had overall responsibility for the interplanetary probe, as 
"inappropriate."  
</P>
<P>
 The Mars Observer, the first U.S. interplanetary probe to fail in flight since 
1967, was designed to provide the most detailed look yet at the planet, serving 
as a pathfinder for an international armada of probes to be launched toward 
Mars in coming decades.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and at JPL, who 
concurred with the board findings Wednesday, earlier had blamed the failure of 
the $980-million mission on a broken transistor in a small but crucial on-board 
clock. Another group, called the Mission Success Review Team at Martin-Marietta 
Corp., which built the missing probe and two other satellites that failed last 
year, attributed the Observer's demise to an attitude: overconfidence on the 
part of the engineers who built the probe. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows for certain exacply what happened to Observer. No sign of the 
probe has been detected since last August. Mission controllers plan one last 
attempt to contact the missing spacecraft next month, but they do not expect 
the probe to reply. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board, in fact, found no smoking gun," said Timothy Coffey, research 
director of the Naval Research Laboratory, who led the panel.  
</P>
<P>
 "There was no telemetry from the spacecraft, no hard evidence to investigate. 
Therefore, it was impossible to provide conclusive evidence," Coffey said. "The 
most probable scenario was a massive rupture of the pressurization system." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Observer's 450-million-mile voyage had proceeded uneventfully until three 
days before its scheduled rendezvous with Mars. To avoid damaging its 
communications gear, ground controllers at JPL turned off the spacecraft's 
communications system while its propulsion system was pressurized. Contact was 
never restored. 
</P>
<P>
 After evaluating 60 different failure scenarios, the panel concluded that the 
most likely cause was a rupture of the probe's titanium fuel lines, triggered 
by a slow leak of nitrogen tetroxide and monomethyl hydrazine during the 
spacecraft's silent 11-month journey through space. 
</P>
<P>
 When the tanks were pressurized Aug. 21, the dribble of volatile chemicals 
could have ignited inside the fuel line, generating pressure of up to 10,000 
pounds per square inch and a temperature as high as 2,000 degrees Centigrade in 
a few millionths of a second. At such a temperature, Coffey said, the fuel line 
would have the strength of butter. 
</P>
<P>
 At best, the ruptured fuel line would act like a jet to send the spacecraft 
tumbling out of control. At worst, the probe could have exploded. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all likelihood, there is still a Mars Observer up there," Coffey said, but 
it is a craft that is "essentially dead. The spacecraft would not know which 
direction it was pointing or in what direction it is rotating." 
</P>
<P>
 While the panel settled on the possible fuel leak as the most likely 
mechanical cause of the probe's disappearance, it said there were broader 
design and management problems as well.  
</P>
<P>
 "JPL was not as familiar with the spacecraft as it should have been," Coffey 
said. He cited "systemic weaknesses" that "remain a concern for future 
programs." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 When the Mars Observer was conceived more than a decade ago, agency planners 
designed it as a low-cost, production-line spacecraft -- the first in a series 
of inexpensive "generic" planetary probes that would capitalize on existing 
technology, just like the series of low-cost Discovery probes that the agency 
is developing today under similar budget constraints. The design also utilized 
equipment developed to operate safely in the shelter of low Earth orbit, but it 
was subjected to the more extreme conditions of interplanetary space.  
</P>
<P>
 As funding dwindled and subsequent planetary missions were canceled in the 
1980s, however, agency managers were unable to keep their technical 
expectations within the boundaries of a fixed-cost contract. They changed the 
instrument packages the probe was to carry. They did not work closely enough 
with the engineers constructing the probe, the panel said, and lost sight of 
the changes that transformed the Observer into a custom-built spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
 JPL officials acknowledged the problem. "The (JPL) management approach 
certainly made the job more difficult," said JPL Director Edward Stone. JPL 
Deputy Director Larry N. Dumas characterized the problem as "creeping 
requirements" and "management Band-Aids."  
</P>
<P>
 "The pressure of the number of changes and demands for systems integration was 
much greater than expected," Dumas said. Troubled Spacecraft A federal panel 
Wednesday announced the findings of its inquiry into the Aug. 21 disappearance 
of the $980 million Mars Observer spacecraft. Exactly what happened to the 
space probe is not known, but the independent panel found these problems: 
Mechanical flaw: A leak of volatile hydrazine fuel may have caused an explosion 
when the spacecraft's tanks were pressurized. Design flaw: NASA engineers used 
technology that had been developed for operation in near-Earth orbit but was 
unsuitable for the more extreme conditions of interplanetary space. Management 
flaw: Project managers at the Jet Propulsion Laboratory did not exercise 
sufficient control continuing changes in the spacecraft's design and its 
scientific instruments. Source: NASA

OJAI RESIDENTS FIGHT TOWER ON 2 FRONTS; COURTS: THEY SAY SYSTEM EMITS DANGEROUS 
LOW-LEVEL RADIATION WAVES AND THAT FEDERAL WORKERS HAD NO RIGHT TO CROSS 
NEIGHBOR'S PROPERTY TO REACH THE FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Fearful that radiation from a microwave tower looming above their back yards 
could eventually kill them, a group of upper Ojai residents is fighting the 
government on two fronts. 
</P>
<P>
 They have hired lawyers to argue today in Ventura County Superior Court that 
landowners William and Ernestine Kee -- who leased land for the tower -- had no 
right to allow federal workers across a neighbor's property to reach the tower. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week attorneys for the residents plan to ask a federal judge to force the 
government to conduct an in-depth environmental assessment of the 
weather-tracking tower before work is completed on the system. 
</P>
<P>
 The microwave system emits low-level radiation waves deemed safe by the 
National Weather Service, which said the system would create no significant 
impacts on the community. 
</P>
<P>
 But other scientists, including a team of researchers from the federal 
Environmental Protection Agency, have said the radar waves might not be 
completely safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams of attorneys representing the Ojai Valley residents are confident 
they will win in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law's the law and the facts are the facts," said attorney Richard C. Loy, 
who lives near the site and will argue the Superior Court case. "I think we're 
in pretty good shape." 
</P>
<P>
 The tower, which resembles a giant steel ball perched atop a wiry black 
scaffold, was erected virtually overnight on a steep Sulphur Mountain ridge 
early last month. It is one of 115 such systems the weather service is building 
across the country under a $4.5-billion renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather station will replace an aging antenna mounted atop the federal 
building in West Los Angeles, providing military leaders with more accurate 
weather data, according to Thomas Potter, the weather service's top regional 
official. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is urgent that the Sulphur Mountain radar become operational as soon as 
possible," Potter said in court papers. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than 100 residents calling themselves the Environmental Coalition of 
Ojai say they fear that extended exposure to the radiation may cause cancer or 
other diseases in their families over coming years. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition is a well-heeled group of property owners made up of many of the 
same people who last year derailed the proposed Weldon Canyon landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 They mobilized quickly after the tower was erected last month, hiring two 
teams of lawyers to fight the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're attacking the problem from all angles," Loy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge John J. Hunter already granted a temporary order against 
the Kees that prohibits them from allowing commercial vehicle traffic across an 
easement they use to enter and leave their ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the group today will ask for an injunction to continue the ban on 
government access to the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no dispute about the law," Loy said. "A prescriptive easement is 
limited to the use by which it was gained. (The Kees) used it for residential 
purposes, therefore anyone picking up that easement can only use it for 
residential purposes." 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of government workers had been crossing plaintiff Agnes Baron's land to 
reach the tower to finish installing the radar system. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hunter agreed with Loy and said that since the access road had never 
before been used for commercial trucks, the Kees were not entitled to include 
use of the easement in their lease agreement with the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Morris of the National Weather Service office in Oxnard said Wednesday 
that construction work on the tower stopped when the restraining order was 
issued. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney William B. Parker of Ventura, who represents the Kees, declined 
comment Wednesday on the case. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said in court papers that Baron and her team of lawyers are using the 
easement issue only to try and stop the government from switching on the 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kees' attorney also has requested that Hunter remove himself from the 
case, contending the judge is prejudiced against the defendants. That issue 
also is scheduled to be decided today. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the U.S. attorney's office in Los Angeles tried to get the easement 
case transferred from Ventura County Superior Court to U.S. District Court. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. District Judge Henry Hupp ruled that since the government was not a 
direct party in the Baron vs. Kees case, he could not make such an order. 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition co-Chairman David Hedman said there is ample reason to require the 
government to perform a detailed environmental assessment before it finishes 
constructing the Sulphur Mountain radar station. 
</P>
<P>
 "New studies say this can be a very harmful radiation that breaks down DNA," 
said Hedman, who lives just beneath the 98-foot tower. "We feel the government 
has broken its own environmental laws."

LIVES IN BLOSSOM; ADDICTS TOIL ON UNUSUAL RANCH IN SANTA PAULA TO REGAIN 
CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A few hours of sweaty fieldwork -- dragging a rake across a newly plowed 
furrow -- gave Jonathan Wood a feeling he had never before experienced. 
</P>
<P>
 He hadn't felt it when he was studying for his business degree at Cal Lutheran 
University. 
</P>
<P>
 Or when he was arrested for selling methamphetamines. 
</P>
<P>
 Or when he was serving any one of his half a dozen prison stints for 
possessing, using or pushing drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 But at Victory Outreach's organic ranch, toiling under a brilliant Santa Paula 
sky, Wood suddenly felt like laughing and crying -- and changing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started thinking about life -- all the bad choices I had made, all the 
wrong decisions," said Wood, a thin 27-year-old. "A force out of nowhere just 
hit me. It was wild." 
</P>
<P>
 Wild, perhaps, for Wood -- but nothing unusual for Victory Outreach. 
</P>
<P>
 Through a regimen of Bible study, prayer and hard work, the nonprofit ministry 
aims to help "the hurting people, the drug addicts, the down-and-outers," in 
the words of Pastor Bob Herrera, who started the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Victory Outreach works best for men and women with religious backgrounds who 
are willing to turn to the Bible for comfort as they struggle to shake their 
addictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fairly severe indoctrination, especially when you're first trying to 
kick the habit; you're basically kept incommunicado," said Jean Farley, an 
assistant public defender who has referred many clients to Victory Outreach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not recommend it for anyone who tells me they do not believe in God 
or do not want to believe in God," she added. "But that almost never happens. 
People get pretty desperate when they're strung out on drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Herrera started the Ventura County branch of Victory Outreach in his 
garage nine years ago, the program has won accolades from local politicians, 
police officers and even former President George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Victory Outreach has also earned the support of a Ventura businessman and 
a Camarillo farmer, who together have helped Herrera achieve his vision of 
merging drug rehabilitation and organic farming on a 34-acre ranch off South 
Mountain Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "Drug addiction is a selfish habit, and the men begin to lose that trait when 
they get on the ranch," Herrera said. "They become responsible. They begin to 
worry about how many weeds are out there, how come this end of the field isn't 
growing like that end. Their minds get healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Investor Mel Cummings sold Victory Outreach the ranch for $500,000 last year 
-- then agreed to carry the mortgage for the ministry, which would be 
hard-pressed to secure a bank loan. "I've seen a lot of miracles happen with 
Victory Outreach," said Cummings, himself a recovering alcoholic. "Any way I 
can help them, I will." 
</P>
<P>
 The same conviction motivated farmer Jim Roberts of Underwood Ranches to 
donate fruit and vegetable seeds, used equipment and hours of his time. 
</P>
<P>
 A Camarillo company, Corona Seeds, also pitched in with several hundred 
dollars worth of vegetable seeds. Owner Michael Newman said he believes in the 
concept of rehabilitation through ranching because working the land can be 
"very therapeutic and very productive, not like pounding bricks or making 
license plates in jail." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from its therapeutic value, the ranch helps keep Victory Outreach 
solvent. 
</P>
<P>
 By selling the organic produce at local farmers markets, the ministry clears 
up to $2,000 a month. Plus, the bountiful crops help cut down on supermarket 
bills. Victory Outreach also relies on donations from its 350 congregation 
members to support the drug rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
 Many ministry members give of their time as well as their money. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, Herrera points to Daniel Lopez, his "minister of farming." 
</P>
<P>
 A heroin addict for 34 years, Lopez wandered into a Victory Outreach church on 
Christmas Day six years ago -- and has been clean ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 He now works on the ranch, overseeing the clients and doing a fair share of 
grubby labor himself. Lopez has turned down plastering jobs paying up to $28 an 
hour, sticking instead with Victory Outreach and its token $50 weekly stipend. 
</P>
<P>
 It's his way of paying back a program that rescued him, he says, from the "pit 
of hell." 
</P>
<P>
 "I believed I would die a drug addict," Lopez said. "I counted 12 times that I 
overdosed and woke up in the emergency room. Then one day I was 47 years old, 
and I looked around and realized I had nothing. Even the shirt on my back was 
borrowed." 
</P>
<P>
 When he first encountered Victory Outreach's philosophy of spirituality and 
hard work, Lopez hesitated. "I was thinking, 'Oh, my God, what did I get myself 
into?' " he recalled. "But I was at the point where, if I had to stand on my 
head for a week to turn my life around, I would have done it." 
</P>
<P>
 Drawing on his own experience with drug addiction, prison time and street 
life, Lopez can empathize with the young men who come to Victory Outreach. Some 
wander in on their own, after hearing of the ministry through friends. Others 
are under court order to work through the rehabilitation program, which runs 
for nine months to a year, depending on individual progress. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Thursday, Lopez stopped his shiny orange tractor in the field to 
counsel Wood, a new arrival from Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They talked aphids and ants, discussed when to pick watermelons and inspected 
a cardboard box full of the summer's last yellow squash. Then Lopez told Wood 
his favorite story -- how he realized, in a flash of insight just a few weeks 
ago, that his infant son Gabriel was the only one of his six children he had 
ever cradled, ever rocked, ever played with. 
</P>
<P>
 The point of the story: Everyone makes mistakes, and everyone should get a 
second chance to do things right. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here to see you guys make it," Lopez said, "every one of you." 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, Lopez directs his clients in six-hour workdays, which start 
shortly after a 6 a.m. prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Hands scarred from years on the streets learn to root out weeds and wield 
hoes. Men who have spent decades strung out on drugs learn to grow and cook 
organic food. City kids who have never seen a zucchini learn to tell the 
difference between romaine and butter lettuce. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I think, 'Aw, I don't want to work on the ranch today. I could be 
out there on the streets,' " said Robert Soto, 35, who started using heroin at 
age 11 and has been in and out of prison ever since. "But working out here 
gives you time to think about what you really want out of life." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials last year put some heat on the Victory Outreach ranch because 
of health and safety violations, including an inadequate waste-disposal system 
and the illegal conversion of a barn into a dormitory. Herrera also ran into a 
problem because the farm sits within an open-space zone that does not allow for 
residential drug rehabilitation programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the past year, Victory Outreach organizers have corrected most of the 
violations, said Todd Collart of the county's planning department. 
</P>
<P>
 The 27 men now going through the program have moved out of the barn. Instead, 
they live off the ranch in Oxnard's Crystal Lodge. Victory Outreach leaders 
recently took over management of the hotel from Cummings, the same investor who 
sold them the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Crystal Lodge, Victory Outreach runs a group home in Santa 
Paula for seven women recovering from drug addiction. Although they do not work 
on the farm, the women help out by selling produce at farmers markets and 
holding car washes to raise money for the church. Several also work at Gospel 
Light, a Christian publishing company based in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood around Crystal Lodge on South Oxnard Boulevard has a 
reputation for being one of the city's most crime-ridden, drug-infested areas, 
Cummings said. He's hoping that Victory Outreach will turn it around. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see recovery become more addictive than drugs and alcohol," he 
said. "I think it can be contagious."

PROSECUTORS WILL SEEK DEATH PENALTY AGAINST 19-YEAR-OLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County prosecutors announced Wednesday that they will seek the death 
penalty against Mark Scott Thornton, the Thousand Oaks teen-ager charged in the 
September slaying of Westlake nurse Kellie O'Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury decided to push for the death penalty after 
reviewing the case with key staffers Tuesday morning, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. Kossoris, who will try the case, said the decision 
was not influenced by Bradbury's announcement Tuesday that he will seek a fifth 
term in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Decisions on capital punishment cases usually come after a defendant is 
charged but before arraignment, Kossoris said. A grand jury charged the 
19-year-old Thornton with the murder in a 14-count indictment returned last 
month. His arraignment is scheduled for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our universal procedure is that we have a meeting on cases where the death 
penalty is a possibility," Kossoris said. "We discuss the case and everybody 
states their opinion, and Mike makes the ultimate decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury was out of the office Wednesday and could not be reached for comment 
on his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Kossoris declined to explain the factors considered in deciding to seek the 
death penalty against Thornton. 
</P>
<P>
 The public defender's office immediately issued a news release criticizing the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel strongly that, should there be a conviction in this case, the 
appropriate sentence for this troubled teen-ager would be life imprisonment 
without the possibility of parole," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys also said in the terse, one-paragraph statement that they 
were surprised by Bradbury's decision to go for the death penalty. Deputy 
Public Defender Howard Asher, co-counsel for Thornton, declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say Thornton kidnaped and fatally shot O'Sullivan, the mother of a 
young son, on Sept. 14. Her body was found amid brush in the Santa Monica 
Mountains 12 days later. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton was arrested in Reno, Nev., on Sept. 19. He was in possession of her 
car. Thornton has admitted to police that he stole O'Sullivan's car and used it 
to abduct his ex-girlfriend, whom he then drove to Reno. But the defendant has 
denied killing O'Sullivan. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin White, O'Sullivan's boyfriend and coordinator of the 12-day civilian 
search for her body, said he was pleased by the decision to seek the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just hope that things go smoothly and happen as they should," he said. "It 
just seems that these cases take so long." 
</P>
<P>
 Kossoris said he expects the Thornton trial to start no sooner than summer 
because attorneys will need several months to prepare their cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton would be the second man to face the death penalty in Ventura County 
in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection began Monday in the trial of Christopher James Sattiewhite, a 
21-year-old convicted felon from Oxnard who is accused of shooting an Oxnard 
woman at point-blank range two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement to seek the death penalty against Thornton comes as the U.S. 
Supreme Court prepares to hear a major challenge to California's death-penalty 
law. The high court has agreed to rule whether jurors in the state are given 
enough guidance in choosing between a death sentence and life imprisonment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura attorney Wendy Lascher, who will argue the Supreme Court appeal of a 
Shasta County man who killed a teacher, said local authorities should narrow 
the grounds on which they seek the death penalty while the high court makes up 
its mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prosecutors should not argue to the jury, for example, that the death penalty 
is warranted because of 'the circumstances of the crime,' " said Lascher, who 
said that phrase is overly vague. 
</P>
<P>
 She also said there should be a clear standard for how Bradbury and other 
district attorneys decide to seek the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just should not have prosecutors making it up as they are going along," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura County prosecutors said they have been instructed by the state 
attorney general's office to continue their current procedures for deciding 
whether to seek the death penalty in murder cases.

CAMPAIGN TO GET GYM IN SHAPE; VENTURA: BOYS & GIRLS CLUB RAISES $100,000 FOR 
RENOVATIONS. OFFICIALS HOPE TO COLLECT $650,000 MORE FOR OTHER UPGRADING 
PROJECTS. 
</P>

<P>
 Ventura Boys & Girls Club officials said they have raised $100,000 so far to 
renovate the group's aging clubhouse in the Ventura Avenue area, one of the 
poorest neighborhoods in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund-raising campaign, which was launched last June, is expected to reach 
its goal of $750,000 by the end of 1996, said local banker Bill Crew, the 
Ventura chapter's fund-raising chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is long overdue that we upgrade this facility," Crew said. "You would not 
believe the wear and tear it has." 
</P>
<P>
 Club officials say they have a long list of needed renovations, including 
upgrading the gymnasium floor and bleachers, adding a new wing for a teen 
center and administrative offices, and fixing the building's bathrooms and 
kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 The 26-year-old building at 1440 N. Olive St. will undergo a major face lift 
beginning in March. 
</P>
<P>
 The club plans to use the money raised so far to first update the facility's 
dilapidated gym, which needs a fresh coat of paint, a wood floor, new 
basketball backboards and a scoreboard. The broken-down bleachers will also be 
repaired, and a new heating system will be installed. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, club officials hope to install a new roof, the new wing, an outdoor 
basketball court, patio, picnic area and bike racks. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen Stewart, a 12-year-old who has been playing basketball at the gym for 
five years, said the repairs are urgently needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The gym gets cold because there is no heating, and thirsty athletes don't have 
a water fountain, Stewart said. The floor is made of linoleum, which has 
missing tiles, and lines that define the court are faded. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't dribble on the floor because of the cracks, and it's dirty," 
Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gym is scheduled to be closed in March for the repairs, club officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not real nice for sports," said Diane Koranda, director of development 
for the Boys & Girls Club. "We're hoping by doing this with the gym to attract 
more teen-agers." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 3,500 boys and girls use the Olive Street clubhouse each year, said 
Barbara Stricker, regional service director. She said the west Ventura club is 
one of the oldest and busiest Boys & Girls clubs in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit organization is dedicated to serving the youth of the community 
with an emphasis on disadvantaged boys and girls. Young people from age 5 to 19 
are eligible to join the club, and the $12 annual membership fee may be waived 
if a child cannot afford it. 
</P>
<P>
 Club officials said they are pleased with the results of the fund-raising 
efforts so far, but Crew said the recession has slowed the pace of donations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult times for some people," said Crew, who is chairman of First 
National Bank of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $100,000 raised so far, $40,000 has come from charitable foundations. 
The rest has come from individuals and businesses in the community, Crew said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura chapter's board of directors, who number about 50, were told to 
raise about $1,000 each through personal contacts, Crew said. Fund-raising 
events will be held later this year, and former Laker basketball star Jamaal 
Wilkes has agreed to serve as honorary chairman for the fund-raising campaign. 
Wilkes, a former Ventura resident, used to play at the Olive Street club. 
</P>
<P>
 Crew noted that because board members already work year-round to raise funds 
for the club's $750,000 operating budget, it has been difficult to ask people 
for more donations for the renovation project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people have said, 'I already gave this year,' " Crew said. "I just show 
them the facts of what we do, and the benefits the Boys & Girls Club gives to 
the community, and then suggest a proper contribution."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; MAN GETS 14 YEARS FOR TRYING TO KILL WIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Ventura County judge on Wednesday sentenced an Oxnard man to 14 years in 
state prison for attempting to kill his estranged wife after lying in wait 
outside the woman's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said the case was unusual because at the time of the attack 
defendant Ronald Anderson was thought to be serving time in the Ventura County 
Jail for an earlier assault on the woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Jailers learned, however, that Anderson's identical twin brother had been 
serving his brother's sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson was convicted of attempted murder, spousal battery and robbery in 
connection with the July 19 incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Anderson hid behind a gate at a park near the Stern Lane home 
of his estranged wife, Brenda. As she arrived from work, he came up behind her 
and started choking her, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her screams alarmed neighbors, and Anderson grabbed the woman's purse and 
tried to steal her car. Unable to get into the car, he returned and choked the 
woman some more until she passed out, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Maeve J. Fox.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Neil B. Quinn recommended a seven-year prison sentence 
for his client, saying he is remorseful for the attack and is not a menace to 
society. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fox said Anderson deserved the maximum sentence of 14 years. She said he 
is a danger to all of society. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell sentenced Anderson to 12 years for attempted murder and causing his 
wife great bodily injury. He received one year in prison for robbery and 
another year for violating probation from the previous spousal-abuse case.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; STREET MUSICIAN SUES OVER LOSS OF PROPERTY

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a handwritten lawsuit, a homeless street musician charged on Wednesday that 
city officials threw away his belongings, including at least six musical 
instruments, while he was in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I was in jail you stole my property," wrote 41-year-old Clifford H. 
Mabra Jr. in court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the musical items Mabra listed were a clarinet, three flutes, a 
saxophone and an acoustic guitar, a pitch pipe, tuning fork, reeds and a music 
book.  
</P>
<P>
 According to a police report, Mabra had been cited at least three times for 
sleeping in a parking structure in the 300 block of Glenneyre Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "Due to the fact that there was a reasonable likelihood that the offenses 
would continue," wrote Sgt. Robert Rahaeuser, Mabra was booked on April 6, 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Material held for storage, according to the property report, included a 
"shopping cart containing numerous bags, boxes and containers with musical 
items. Nothing of notable value." 
</P>
<P>
 Mabra said in his suit that when he returned May 21 to claim his belongings, 
"he was told it had been thrown away in the trash dumpster." 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials declined to comment on the suit, but Sgt. Mike Hall said 
Mabra "is one of the street people in town" who has played his saxophone 
downtown for the past 10 years.  
</P>
<P>
 Hall said that normally seized property is neither destroyed nor discarded. 
</P>
<P>
 Mabra, who lists his home address as St. Mary's Episcopal Church -- where he 
also is registered to vote -- could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, a Superior Court commissioner ordered Santa Ana police to stop 
throwing away belongings of transients. MARK I. PINSKY

<P>
 A late-night argument in front of a Fillmore house ended with one man being 
shot in the hand as he tried to wrestle a gun away from another man, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies have made no arrests in the shooting that occurred about 
11:20 p.m. Tuesday in the 200 block of Palm Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of piecing together what kind of crime has been committed, if 
any," said Lt. Craig Husband.  
</P>
<P>
 Edmundo Robles, 28, initially refused medical treatment for the minor gunshot 
wound on his left hand but later went to a hospital for care. 
</P>
<P>
 Robles first told deputies he had fallen and scraped his hand but later 
admitted being shot. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred as Robles and his brother, Miguel Robles, 27, argued 
with Santiago Navarro, 20, in the front yard of the Robles home, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said Navarro had left the scene by the time deputies arrived. When he 
was picked up a short time later, he did not have a weapon with him, officials 
said. JULIE FIELDS

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN GABRIEL VALLEY; 
INVESTIGATORS LINK SLAYINGS OF 3 STRANGLED WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Investigators have linked the slayings of three women found strangled recently 
in the San Gabriel Valley, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives from the Pomona Police Department and the Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Department said they also are trying to determine whether two other 
slayings are linked to the three San Gabriel Valley cases. 
</P>
<P>
 All five victims were black, in their 30s and believed to have been 
prostitutes, Sheriff's Deputy Larry Mead said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victims were Betty Sue Harris, 37, of Pomona, whose body was dumped Nov. 1 
in the City of Industry; Roxanne Brooks Bates, 31, of Pomona, found Nov. 5 
along a road near Chino; Helen Ruth Hill, 36, of West Covina, found Nov. 14 in 
a parking lot in Industry; Donna Lenore Goldsmith, 35, of Montclair, discovered 
Nov. 17 near a trash bin in Pomona; and Cheryl Sayer, in her mid-30s, whose 
body was found Dec. 30 in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have determined the Hill, Goldsmith and Sayer slayings are 
connected but do not have enough information at this point to connect the other 
two homicides, Mead said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: REPORT URGES SCRAPPING 
4 PLANNED COURTHOUSES FOR LACK OF FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Faced with dwindling revenue and escalating costs for new courthouse 
construction, Los Angeles County officials are recommending the completion of 
only two of eight projects that already have cost millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations released late Wednesday by Chief Administrative Officer 
Sally R. Reed touched off protest from officials who have lobbied for an 
$80-million courthouse in the Antelope Valley city of Lancaster and from 
residents of Chatsworth, who have sued the county to block construction of a 
$51.5-million facility there. 
</P>
<P>
 The projects recommended for completion are the facility near Chatsworth and 
one near Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 16-page report, Reed recommends that the Board of Supervisors 
indefinitely postpone construction of the six proposed courthouses, which 
already have cost the county $16 million for land acquisition, design and other 
expenses. Besides Lancaster, the facilities were to be located in Pasadena, 
West Los Angeles, the South Bay, Santa Monica and North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 As a stop-gap measure, Reed recommends that the county lease space for traffic 
cases and other non-criminal matters to free up courtrooms in the Antelope 
Valley, South Bay and Santa Monica until there are sufficient funds to build 
new courthouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Courthouse construction funds come from a portion of general court fines, 
court-imposed traffic school fees and parking citations. After increasing 
during the late 1980s, annual revenue for courthouse construction has been 
dropping steadily since 1989. Annual revenue fell from $25 million that year to 
$16.5 million in the last fiscal year, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The county will face deficits of up to $312 million over a nine-year period if 
it continues with plans to build all 10 courthouses, the report states.  
</P>
<P>
 The issue is scheduled to come before the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 The projects in Chatsworth and near LAX should go forward, Reed said, because 
the county has sunk about $40.2 million in those facilities, compared to about 
$5.8 million in the Lancaster project. TRACEY KAPLAN

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: GANG TRUCE HAS BROUGHT 
LITTLE AID, WATTS LEADER COMPLAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCILLE RENWICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Watts community leader who helped forge a truce among area gang members 
nearly two years ago complained Wednesday that much of the support promised 
from the private and public sectors has yet to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Williams, the founder of the Common Ground Foundation, a program for 
school dropouts, said many of the gang members are still looking for the jobs 
and educational opportunities promised in the wake of the riots that charred 
South-Central Los Angeles and other parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing at the site of a burned-out market on 103rd Street, accompanied by 
about 20 formerly warring gang members, Williams accused NAACP Executive 
Director Ben Chavis and others of having slighted those trying to hold the 
truce together. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sick and tired of black leaders from Ben Chavis to Jesse Jackson to 
Maxine Waters to Danny Bakewell saying they're going to help us and doing 
nothing," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're tired of having our brothers being used as people's political and 
economic steppingstones, of them coming in here taking pictures with us and 
then leaving us with nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Last April, before the verdicts in the second Rodney G. King beating trial, 
Chavis spent five days visiting the Imperial Courts housing project. He pledged 
to fund a leadership program proposed by Common Ground, but the help has not 
materialized, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis, who is in Los Angeles this week for the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People's Image Awards, could not be reached for comment. 
But Don Rojas, head of communications at NAACP national headquarters, said the 
organization has given about $7,000 to Williams to support the Los Angeles gang 
truce. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the organization is helping the gang truce movement nationwide, 
Rojas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to get gang members to put aside traditional rivalries has been 
credited with reducing violence in some areas of the city, even while it flares 
in others. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the truce among Bloods and Crips factions in the Watts area, 21 men 
were killed in "personal conflicts" there in 1993, mostly because of 
longstanding tensions, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Common Ground leader said the truce effort has received substantial 
support from some groups, including the Southern Christian Leadership 
Conference and the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "All they're asking for is a better education, a job, basically, a better 
chance so they can move away from this life," Williams said of the gang members 
involved in the truce. "But instead all they hear are talks for more gun bills 
and crime bills and toys for guns, which won't do anything."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CHURCH'S BURIAL 
TRADITION HITS BUREAUCRATIC SNAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The archbishop of the Syrian Orthodox Church knows exactly where he wants his 
body to be laid to rest when he dies: in a vault nestled discreetly behind the 
altar of a church in Burbank. For 2,000 years, esteemed leaders have been 
honored with this type of entombment, say church leaders, and members of the 
Burbank church want to continue the practice. 
</P>
<P>
 But their plans suffered a setback this week, when the Burbank City Council 
rejected a zone text amendment that would have allowed burials inside or 
underneath church property through a conditional use permit. In a 4-1 vote, the 
council let stand the code restricting burials to one cemetery zone in the 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the council and some Burbank residents expressed concern that 
allowing the entombment at St. Ephraim Syrian Orthodox Church would make it 
difficult for the council to reject similar requests from individuals who might 
misuse the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Started in 1963 by immigrants from the Middle East, St. Ephraim is now the 
largest Syrian Orthodox congregation in the United States and Canada, according 
to Pastor Joseph Tarzi. The church's Archbishop Athanasius Samuel is 86.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; PHOTOS TRACE BLACK HISTORY IN 3 
COUNTIES 
</P>

<P>
 A new photo exhibition in Port Hueneme depicts the history of the African 
American community in Ventura, Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties from 
the early 1800s to the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is part of a series depicting the life of various ethnic groups in 
the three-county area. Latinos were highlighted in 1993, and Asian Americans 
and Native Americans will be featured in 1995 and '96. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, at a reception introducing the exhibit to the public, some of 
those whose family photographs are on display talked about their experiences as 
African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Bedford Pinkard, the first African American elected to the Oxnard City 
Council, spoke to the audience of about 50 people about his family's migration 
from Texas to Ventura County.  
</P>
<P>
 In May, 1942, Pinkard said, his mother waited in line eight hours to buy six 
Greyhound bus tickets for the family. "She had to step aside every time a white 
person wanted to buy a ticket," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the speeches and a medley of spiritual and Christmas songs by local 
singer Jessie Washington, participants had a chance to look around. 
</P>
<P>
 Leroy Gibson Jr., 55, stared at a picture of his father, Leroy Gibson Sr., an 
Oxnard professional boxer known as the Wichita Wildcat. "My kids will come here 
so they can learn about the recent history of our family and race," said Gibson 
Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 The approximately 100 photographs in the exhibit were collected by 12 members 
of the Black Gold Cooperative Library System, a three-county joint-powers 
system. The show offers a glimpse of family, church, work and social life in 
the three counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Excited by seeing pictures of old friends, some of whom have died, Ira Mae 
Verrett, an Oxnard resident since 1946, said the exhibition is as much 
educational as nostalgic. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of our children don't know that their race of people have participated 
in the making of Ventura County," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The show will run through Jan. 31 at Ray D. Prueter Library, 510 Park Ave. in 
Port Hueneme. Hours are 3 to 7 p.m. Monday and Tuesday and 1 to 5 p.m. 
Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, the exhibition is scheduled to travel to San Luis Obispo County.

 The City Council has voted to support Anaheim in its opposition to the County 
Board of Supervisors' proposal for an agency to plan the redevelopment of the 
El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 But it stopped short of joining with any of the alternative organizations 
being formed. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted to join Anaheim in protesting the formation of a nine-member 
panel composed of the five supervisors, three representatives from Irvine and 
one from Lake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we are going to have a voice in whatever (uses the base is put to), we had 
better stand up now and object with Anaheim," said Councilman John M. 
Gullixson. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Barbara Kiley, who serves as the city's representative to the League of 
California Cities, was authorized by the council to oppose the supervisors' 
plan when the league considers its position on the subject next week. 
</P>
<P>
 But the council specifically restricted Kiley from committing the city to any 
such alternative plan as the Orange County Regional Airport Authority, formed 
by Garden Grove, Los Alamitos and Stanton, which Anaheim is considering 
joining. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

 Ventura officials and developers of a proposed large residential and 
commercial project on Ventura Avenue will hold a public meeting today to 
discuss the project with nearby property owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The Neel and Huntsinger families and Kinko's -- the national copy service 
company headquartered in the neighborhood -- want to develop their land by 
filling vacant lots and razing a lemon grove to make way for 330 residential 
units, a park, business offices and industrial buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 If the development is approved by the Ventura City Council, it could 
substantially upgrade the old industrial area, said Bill Neel, one of the major 
property owners involved in the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the project would be developed on about 50 acres, a total of 78 acres 
could potentially be rezoned from industrial to residential, Assistant City 
Planner Phil Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The area is bounded by Stanley Avenue on the south, Seneca Street on the 
north, Ventura Avenue on the east and California 33 on the west. About 13 
parcels could be affected if the proposal is approved, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Industrial businesses would be able to continue operating, but would be 
restricted from expanding, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood, which is dominated by the Kinko's headquarters, is a 
mishmash of vacant lots, industrial businesses, and storage lots for old cars 
and buses. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is scheduled to consider the project and rezoning the area 
later this month. PEGGY Y. LEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; 3 ARMED ROBBERS STAGE BANK TAKEOVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Ventura County's first bank robbery of the year, three men on Wednesday 
staged a violent takeover of the American Savings Bank in Oxnard and made off 
with a substantial amount of cash from the vault, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbery occurred after three men entered the bank at 560 S. A St. about 
9:15 a.m. and one asked a teller for change for a dollar, authorities said. He 
then pointed a gun at the teller's face, vaulted over the counter and forced 
her to lie on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 A second suspect also vaulted over the counter, pointed a gun at the bank's 
assistant manager and ordered her to lie down, authorities said. The third 
suspect held a gun to the head of an employee who had been talking on a phone 
across the room and told her to hang up. 
</P>
<P>
 Two customers and a repairman also were ordered to the ground.  
</P>
<P>
 One robber forced the assistant manager into the vault, where he stuffed money 
into a white pillow case, authorities said. All three men ran out the rear door 
of the bank and were last seen running north down an alley, then east on 5th 
Street toward Oxnard Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 During the robbery, the suspects threatened to kill the employees and 
customers as they barked orders at them. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of yelling, frantic statements, threats, gestures, things 
like that," said FBI Agent Larry Dick, who is investigating the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe the robbers came from the Los Angeles area, where such 
takeover robberies are more common. Dick said Ventura County has had only one 
other takeover robbery similar to Wednesday's. That occurred in July, 1992, at 
the Wells Fargo on Chestnut Street in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities today will review the videotape from a surveillance camera that 
was running in the bank. Dick said those pictures will be compared to suspects 
in other takeover robberies. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; ENVIRONMENTALISTS PROTEST AT CITY HALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Environmental advocates and RV resort critics demonstrated outside the Port 
Hueneme City Hall on Wednesday, accusing city officials of omitting study of 
development planned for the coastline in a revision of the city's General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 A small band of activists picketed outside the civic center before the start 
of a hearing on the revised plan and its effect on the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Sanders, chairman of the Los Padres chapter of the Sierra Club, said the 
protest was intended to focus attention on the city's decision to omit much of 
the city's beach from the environmental review. 
</P>
<P>
 "The significant part is not that people are carrying signs, but that people 
are not accepting the city's statement that this is not controversial," Sanders 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders said the residents were unhappy that the city had dropped from the 
plan any discussion of future uses at the 33-acre Navy Civilian Engineering 
Laboratory or the 10-acre site of the City Council's proposed RV resort. 
</P>
<P>
 "To do a general plan that excludes the area of the coast is really a waste of 
time," Sanders said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan, which was last revised in 1977, spells out the future of development 
in the city through the year 2015. 
</P>
<P>
 In it, the city identifies 18 blighted properties totaling 61 acres that 
should be redeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the revised 20-year plan would allow 1,067 more dwelling units in the 
city, 390 units less than the previous plan allows. The plan also calls for 
250,000 square feet of new commercial building, 419,000 square feet of light 
industrial facilities and 97,000 square feet of port-related businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Without comment, the City Council directed staff to return with a final 
version of the report as soon as possible. PATRICK McCARTNEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; SATELLITE DISH IS REMOVED AT SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A microwave satellite dish that PacTel officials say helped emergency workers 
communicate in the days after the October fire has been removed from El Morro 
Elementary School because of a continuing outcry from parents who fear it may 
pose a health risk to children. 
</P>
<P>
 The dish had been installed in the summer, but PacTel officials say it was 
only put to use during the Friday and Saturday after the Laguna Beach fire when 
land-line telephone service went down. 
</P>
<P>
 The telecommunications satellite was removed last month after an emotional 
meeting with parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Linda Purrington said most parents were concerned about the danger 
from possible emission of electromagnetic radiation. Doug Rowe, who has two 
children attending the school, expressed relief Tuesday that the dish is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "My God, it never should have been there in the first place," he said. "Why 
have it hovering over a child's classroom?" 
</P>
<P>
 PacTel and school district officials, however, said the microwave dish did not 
pose a risk to children. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's never been any demonstrated correlation between cellular 
transmissions and any damage to human beings, or animals for that matter," said 
Melissa May, public relations manager for PacTel in Irvine. "It's an emotional 
issue and kind of an alarmist issue, but it's not all based on a lot of 
knowledge." 
</P>
<P>
 Both PacTel and district officials also said they are concerned that 
communications could be imperiled in a future emergency if land lines go down 
near the school. 
</P>
<P>
 In that case, service for PacTel cellular telephones would be nonexistent 
unless the satellite dish was reinstalled, they say. Currently, the dish is in 
storage in a warehouse in Los Angeles County, May said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the case of emergency, we don't have anything to fall back on right now," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 To address that problem, school district officials announced this week that 
they will form a committee to develop guidelines for the use of the 
telecommunication dish in the event of another emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some people had speculated that the satellite dish may have played a 
role in providing a communications link to allow children to be evacuated from 
the school during the October fire, a PacTel representative said Tuesday the 
dish was not operating on that day. 
</P>
<P>
 While cellular phones were heavily relied upon at that time, they were 
operating via land lines then, said PacTel representative Neil Fitzpatrick, who 
is also a former Laguna Beach mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board had approved a contract in November, 1991, to lease a parcel 
of land at El Morro Elementary to PacTel for $18,000 a year. A 90-foot 
microwave tower and its underground components were installed in August. LESLIE

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: HERMOSA BEACH; COUNTY 
TO PAY FOR BEACH SERVICES THROUGH JUNE 30 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of threatening to pull lifeguards and some beach groomers out of 
Hermosa Beach in a funding dispute, the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors 
has agreed to continue the services through June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors voted 5 to 0 to maintain the services after the Hermosa Beach 
City Council reluctantly offered to contribute $107,000 annually to help pay 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
 It now costs the county $1.3 million a year to provide lifeguards and beach 
cleaning crews for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said they hope the agreement will guide negotiations with 
other beach cities, including Redondo Beach, Avalon and Manhattan Beach, which 
have also balked at paying more for county services.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; MAN GETS 
20 YEARS FOR RACIALLY MOTIVATED SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A black man who told police he shot a white man in hopes of starting a race 
war was sentenced Wednesday to 20 years in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Mary Ann Murphy imposed the sentence on Darryl Arnold, 
31, who earlier pleaded no contest to attempted murder and a civil rights 
charge stemming from a March 17 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Arnold bought a gun, waited the required 15 days for a 
background check and -- once he got the weapon -- left his house with the 
intention of shooting the first white man he saw. Robert Nimmons, an 
accountant, was shot once in the back while walking down San Vicente Boulevard 
in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 A passerby rushed Nimmons to nearby Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, where doctors 
saved his life.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; UNIVERSITY REVIEWING STADIUM-USE POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The president of Cal State Fullerton may change a policy that bans religious 
groups from using the school's 10,000-seat football stadium, according to 
university spokesman Jerry Keating. 
</P>
<P>
 President Milton A. Gordon decided to review the policy after city officials 
and church groups pressed him for a change, Keating said. Gordon was not 
available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sal Rinella, university vice president for administration, said there is a 
traditional statewide practice of not allowing state-owned facilities to be 
used for religious or political purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 The current policy, written by Gordon, also prohibits public events that seek 
to raise money for projects not related to the university, and offers political 
campaigns and religious crusades as examples. 
</P>
<P>
 The Evangelical Free Church of Fullerton has applied to rent the stadium on 
April 3 for an Easter service that could fill the sports facility, said Jac 
LaTour, a church director. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eastside Christian Church applied last spring to use the 10,000-seat 
stadium, but was denied, Keating said. "We have not approved the stadium for 
religious services," he said. "As a state agency, we don't advocate one 
religion or the other." 
</P>
<P>
 LaTour said his church does let people make donations during the service, but 
is not celebrating Easter to raise money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Giving is part of worship," LaTour said. "What we're doing is acknowledging 
to God that he has provided everything we have in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
 City Council member Chris Norby said the rejection of church services at the 
stadium amounts to discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the stadium should be open to all community groups that want to rent 
it for a lawful purpose," Norby said. 
</P>
<P>
 Keating said the university's open spaces, like the main quadrangle, are open 
to political and religious groups. But the stadium and other facilities are to 
be used primarily for education or sports, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The stadium, which received more than $10 million in city aid, was first used 
for the university's 1992 graduation ceremonies, Keating said. It is now used 
by the Los Angeles Salsa soccer team for games, the Los Angeles Rams for 
practice, and by other teams, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Keating said no religious services have been held in the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Former council member Richard C. Ackerman, who pushed for city funding for the 
stadium, said he is confident that Gordon will allow religious groups to use 
the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Ackerman, who served on the council from 1980 to 1992, is now a member of 
Gordon's personal advisory board. He said Gordon has already drafted a more 
permissive policy, and is reviewing it with other Cal State officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think President Gordon would like to see the policy changed," Ackerman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ackerman said he gave Gordon a copy of a 1993 U.S. Supreme Court ruling that 
public schools may not exclude a group from their grounds just because they 
intend to offer a religious message. 
</P>
<P>
 Rinella said the court ruling is being considered in the review of the policy. 
"The president has been going through a very thoughtful review process," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Keating said he is not sure when Gordon will release the new policy. WILLSON

<P>
 A man was killed early Wednesday when the car in which he was a passenger went 
out of control and crashed on Coast Highway, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, whose name has not been released pending notification of his 
relatives, was trapped inside the car after the 2:30 a.m. accident, which 
occurred just west of Balboa Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, 24-year-old Jennifer Merry, managed to climb out of the mangled 
car on her own before help arrived. She was arrested on suspicion of vehicular 
manslaughter, Newport police Sgt. Andy Gonis said, adding that the crash may 
have been alcohol-related. 
</P>
<P>
 Merry was driving east on Coast Highway when her car jumped onto the center 
median, careened across the eastbound lanes, went up a curb, crashed into a 
concrete pole and finally landed upside down, Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Merry was treated for injuries at Western Medical Center-Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 She is being held at Orange County Jail on $25,000 bail. GREG HERNANDEZ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; SOMETHING TO CHEER ABOUT AT MATER DEI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DI RADO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aspiring athletes have been known to make their choice of high schools based 
on the strength of schools' basketball or football teams. But cheerleading? 
</P>
<P>
 That's the case at Mater Dei High School in Santa Ana, considered to be one of 
nation's cheerleading powerhouses. The school's 20-member varsity cheer squad 
took first place among 31 teams in the National Cheerleaders Assn. 
championships in Dallas last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The win was the latest in a string of victories for the Monarchs of Mater Dei, 
a Catholic school with an enrollment of 2,100 students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came to this school to cheer," said Julie Canzone of Cypress, who is the 
squad's co-captain. Like many of her teammates, 17-year-old Canzone started 
doing flips and stunts in elementary and junior high school. 
</P>
<P>
 The varsity squad, under the direction of John Merino since 1960, has won 
three straight United Spirit Assn. national competitions since 1990, and won 
the national title in the Universal Cheerleaders Assn. competition -- in 
Orlando, Fla. -- in 1987 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The team members -- 15 girls and five boys -- said they are athletes. Merino 
said that in his 34 years as adviser, cheerleading has changed into a stage 
where strong gymnasts perform precise routines. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the squad's male members said classmates sometimes tease them 
because they are cheerleaders. It's harder than it looks, they respond. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first got on the team, I'd sit with guys and they'd say, 'Oh, I'm 
having lunch with a cheerleader,' " said co-captain Scott Gabster, 18, of 
Fountain Valley. Despite the teasing, Gabster thinks cheerleading is a good way 
to keep up his gymnastics skills, which he has honed for more than eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 Another co-ed team from Santa Ana -- Century High School's squad -- recently 
won the Universal Cheerleading Assn. regional competition, beating four other 
Southern California teams. That team seeks donations so it can compete in the 
national finals in Orlando in February, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second straight year that the team placed first in the region, 
Century's pep squad adviser Judy Kooi said. She said that the 10 boys and nine 
girls on the squad will hold fund-raisers to help defray the $20,000 cost of 
the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Donations may be sent to: Century Cheer Boosters, Century High School, 1401 S. 
Grand Ave., Santa Ana, Calif. 92707.ALICIA DI RADO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; OFFICERS BID FAREWELL TO GIFTED POLICE DOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As 13 police dogs yelped and whined and their masters held back tears at the 
Sea Breeze Pet Cemetery, the Newport Beach Police Department on Wednesday laid 
to rest Dingo, a 10-year-old German shepherd who died last week after surgery.  
</P>
<P>
 Dingo's handler, Newport Beach Police Officer Dave Stetson, read an emotional 
poem about the brave and obedient dog to a gathering of canine officers from as 
far away as Buena Park and Tustin, and about 20 Newport Beach police officers, 
including Chief Bob McDonell. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like losing a member of the department," said Stetson, who wore a black 
band over the badge on his uniform. "He was a gifted dog." 
</P>
<P>
 A varnished wooden box containing Dingo's ashes will be buried in the 
cemetery, which is also the resting place of police dogs from Brea, Huntington 
Beach and Inglewood. Behind the box stood a framed picture of Dingo sitting on 
the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were trained as a team," Newport Beach Police Sgt. Andy Gonis said of 
Stetson and Dingo, who was one of the oldest police dogs in the county. "They 
experienced potentially life-threatening situations together. The dog and he 
were partners." 
</P>
<P>
 The dog died Dec. 29 of complications from surgery to remove a cyst from a 
hind leg, Gonis said. 
</P>
<P>
 His death leaves the department with only two police dogs, one of which is 
near retirement age of about 10 years. The dogs specialize in rooting out 
felony suspects who are hiding from officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Because there is no money budgeted for another of the highly trained dogs, 
three residents of Newport Beach have donated a total of $16,000 to provide 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be difficult to replace Dingo, whose duties included ferreting out 
hidden suspects, searching homes where burglary alarms had sounded and 
assisting in searches for missing children. Stetson gave the dog commands in 
German because Dingo was trained in Frankfurt, Germany. The dog's full name was 
Dingo vom Haus Westfalen. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to more than six years on the force, Dingo competed in 
international police dog championships and, according to Stetson, was one of 
the 50 best police dogs in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was most obedient dog I have ever seen. He did everything well and read me 
very well," the 13-year veteran said.  
</P>
<P>
 Tom Voth, another canine unit officer at Newport Beach, said that police dogs 
provide unusually good protection for officers. The dogs are trained to attack 
anybody who might lunge at their masters and are "a good psychological weapon. 
Most (suspects) see the dog and just give up," Voth said. 
</P>
<P>
 In accordance with department policy, Stetson kept Dingo at home with him.  
</P>
<P>
 "He slept on the floor next to the bed," Stetson said. "He went to softball 
games with me and visited my family. This is tragic and painful." BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; STREET REALIGNMENT ANGERS RESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dale Street will be realigned at Malvern Avenue with Burlingame Avenue -- a 
residential street into the Bellehurst neighborhood -- the City Council decided 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's 3-2 decision, with councilwomen Donna L. Chessen and Rhonda J. 
McCune dissenting, angered Burlingame Avenue residents who believe realigning 
Dale with their street will add traffic and speeders to their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Burch, a 10-year Burlingame resident and retired firefighter, said the 
council's decision "stinks." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not listening to anybody but themselves," Burch said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council was faced with deciding which of the two residential streets, 
Burlingame Avenue or Monticello Avenue, should be aligned with Dale Street, or 
if Dale should remain as a T-intersection that dead-ends at Malvern Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials, as well as the conclusion of an environmental impact report, 
recommended Burlingame. 
</P>
<P>
 Marty and Teri Raymondo, who have lived on Burlingame since 1986, also were 
disappointed with the decision, causing them to consider selling their home, 
the couple said after the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously we're unhappy," Marty Raymondo said. The council "was thinking with 
their pocketbook and greed. They see the opportunity. They want the state money 
and they don't care who it hurts." 
</P>
<P>
 The project, estimated to cost up to $9 million, includes the realignment as 
well as the construction of a railroad underpass on Dale Street north of 
Artesia Boulevard. The project will be paid with state, county and local money, 
including $5 million from the Public Utilities Commission for the railroad 
underpass. 
</P>
<P>
 Teri Raymondo also said Burlingame has a problem with speeding motorists and 
fears it will get worse when it becomes a four-way signal intersection with 
Dale Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is nobody drives the speed limit," she said, adding she prefers 
leaving Dale Street as it exists to avoid traffic impacts to either Burlingame 
or Monticello. 
</P>
<P>
 Burlingame Avenue is the better alternative because it would improve traffic 
flow and visibility, reducing the potential for accidents while increasing 
traffic safety, said Donald K. Jensen, director of public works. 
</P>
<P>
 Chessen said she voted against the Burlingame Avenue realignment because she 
favors Monticello Avenue as the better alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 Chessen added that she still favored the project and called it a "coup" that 
the city will receive the state money for the underpass construction. 
</P>
<P>
 McCune said she wasn't happy with any of the realignment proposals and 
preferred to "do nothing" at this time. 
</P>
<P>
 As a last-ditch effort, Chessen and McCune voted to leave Dale Street as a 
T-intersection. But the council majority disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 McCune also said she empathized with Burlingame residents: "If I lived on 
Burlingame, I would be just as emotional as the people who live on Burlingame." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Arthur C. Brown said, leaving emotions and politics aside, he voted 
for the Burlingame realignment because it makes the most sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Burlingame is the only safe way to do that intersection," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Street is planned to be closed during the 12 months of construction, 
expected to begin in October. DEBRA CANO

COUUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CITIES TO GET SAY IN POLLUTION POLICIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Complying with a new state law, the Ventura County Board of Supervisors has 
agreed to give cities a say for the first time in setting county policies 
intended to reduce air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The board voted 5 to 0 on Tuesday to appoint city representatives to the Air 
Pollution Control District board, which now includes all five supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county and the cities together must determine the number of 
representatives," said Richard H. Baldwin, the county's top air pollution 
official.  
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors Vicky Howard and Susan K. Lacey plan to meet with city officials 
within the next few weeks to work out the details. 
</P>
<P>
 If county and city leaders cannot agree on the board's composition before 
July, the law requires that the board be made up of an equal number of county 
and city leaders. TINA DAUNT

JACKSON IS PRESENTER AT NAACP AWARDS; ENTERTAINMENT: SINGER'S SURPRISE 
APPEARANCE CAPS A SERIES OF CONTROVERSIAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THIS YEAR'S IMAGE 
EVENT. 
</P>

 Embattled superstar Michael Jackson was a surprise presenter at the NAACP's 
26th annual Image Awards on Wednesday, further heightening the profile of this 
year's controversy-tinged event. 
</P>
<P>
 Angered by the nomination for one of the awards of "gangsta" rapper Tupac 
Shakur, several black women's groups had threatened to boycott the prestigious 
ceremonies, and some expected protesters to appear outside the Pasadena Civic 
Auditorium, where the event was held. 
</P>
<P>
 However, no protest was in evidence as the ceremonies got under way. 
</P>
<P>
 Several celebrities were annoyed by questions regarding the presence of 
Shakur, who was nominated for outstanding lead actor in a motion picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Jasmine Guy, who won an Image Award on Wednesday for outstanding actress in a 
comedy series for her now-defunct show "A Different World," snapped at 
reporters' questions about rap music and Shakur. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have not yet seen due process," Guy said of Shakur, who is charged with 
sexual assault and weapons violations. "They are not preachers, they are not 
educators, they are rappers." 
</P>
<P>
 The black-tie awards show was created by the NAACP's Hollywood branch in 1967 
to recognize African Americans in the entertainment industry who have worked to 
"ensure a positive portrayal of African Americans in all areas of the 
entertainment industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Winners of awards announced early in the evening included TV star and producer 
Martin Lawrence, who got top honors as actor in a comedy series for his role in 
"Martin," and for the series itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The TV series awards mostly stuck with the familiar, with honors going to 
"I'll Fly Away," Alex Haley's "Queen" and to "The Young and the Restless," 
which won outstanding daytime drama series for the second year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 The awards were taped for broadcast on Jan. 22 at 11:30 p.m. on NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 Pop singer Jackson, accused by a 13-year-old boy of molesting him, was 
referred to by one of the hosts as "Michael Innocent Until Proven Guilty 
Jackson," drawing loud cheers from the audience.

AWARD URGED FOR MAN NOT TOLD OF DANGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles City Council committee recommended a $1.2-million award Tuesday 
for a North Hollywood theater manager who was shot after police learned about 
threats against the man but failed to alert him to the danger. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Budget and Finance Committee voted unanimously to award the 
settlement to George Carpenter, 45, who now lives in Ohio and is recovering 
from four gunshot wounds that left him with facial nerve damage and other 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a horrendous story and a horrendous case," Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky, chairman of the city's Budget and Finance Committee, said after 
voting for the settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter was robbed at his theater in 1984 and was expected to testify 
against the suspect. Police had assured Carpenter that he was in no danger, but 
they later learned that the suspect had tried to solicit a contract hit on him. 
However, police did not relay that information to Carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Second District Court of Appeals found the city liable for 
Carpenter's injuries and in the process gave police officials more 
responsibility for warning witnesses about threats they face for testifying in 
criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the vote on Carpenter's settlement, Yaroslavsky instructed the Los 
Angeles Police Department to draft a report within 60 days outlining the steps 
the department takes to notify potential witnesses about such threats. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter's troubles began in October, 1984, when Daniel S. Jenkins robbed him 
at gunpoint at the United Artists movie theater that he managed. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 4, 1985, Carpenter was shot in the face, stomach and legs as he sat in 
a bar next to the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Three months later, on Halloween night, Los Angeles Police Detective Thomas C. 
Williams was shot and killed in an ambush outside a Canoga Park church school 
just a few hours after testifying against Jenkins in his robbery and assault 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Jenkins was convicted of the shooting death of Williams and the 
attempted murder of Carpenter and is on death row. 
</P>
<P>
 A police investigation into Williams' murder determined that three months 
before Carpenter was shot, two officers had interviewed an informant in the Los 
Angeles County Jail who told them that Jenkins had been soliciting a contract 
hit on Carpenter, according to a city attorney's report. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators passed the information on to an officer in the LAPD's North 
Hollywood Division, the report said, but the warning was never passed on.

MAJOR ARMENIAN CLERIC URGES CUT IN FILM VIOLENCE; RELIGION: KAREKIN II, LEADER 
OF THE ARMENIAN APOSTOLIC CHURCH, IS IN SOUTHLAND TO PARTICIPATE IN HOLIDAY 
OBSERVANCES. HE SAYS TOO MANY MOVIES DISTORT U.S. IMAGE OVERSEAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In another sign of growing concern about the content of Hollywood films, the 
spiritual leader of many of the world's Armenian Christians has called on 
filmmakers to turn from the depiction of violence, sex and moral 
permissiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 On his fifth pontifical visit to the United States, His Holiness Karekin II of 
the Armenian Apostolic Church, headquartered in Beirut, said too many films 
distort the image of America overseas and encourage impressionable youths to 
copy what they see. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many young people not only are impressed temporarily and superficially. More 
than that, they begin to copy the things they see. They begin to consider this 
form of culture as normative for dignified civilization," said Karekin, who 
arrived in Los Angeles Tuesday to participate in Christmas observances for 
Armenians, who celebrate Christmas today. 
</P>
<P>
 Karekin's welcoming visit Tuesday night at St. Garabed Armenian Apostolic 
Church in Hollywood drew an excited crowd of several hundred faithful. The 
Armenian Apostolic Church is one of two major Armenian Orthodox bodies in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time I'm going to see him. Our people are very excited," 
said Sonia Kasparian of Glendale, who had tears in her eyes. "It definitely is 
going to be a very special Christmas." 
</P>
<P>
 Karekin's pointed critique of what he called pseudo-culture comes at a time of 
growing criticism of theatrical motion pictures and television from a wide 
range of religious leaders. Last August, for example, Pope John Paul II said 
during World Youth Day activities in Denver that violence in any form is a 
denial of human dignity. The Roman pontiff specifically mentioned the media, 
among others, as having responsibility for what was happening in society. 
Religious broadcaster Pat Robertson and others have also complained about the 
content of television and motion pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the Los Angeles Times Poll found that nearly four out of five 
Americans believe that violence in television entertainment programs directly 
contributes to the amount of violence in society. 
</P>
<P>
 Karekin was elected as a Catholicos, another term for pope, in 1983. His 
Armenian Apostolic Church and the separate Armenian Church of North America 
disagree on the number of members in each branch. There are an estimated 
300,000 Armenian Orthodox Christians in Southern California. The Armenian 
Church of North America is led by His Holiness Vazken I and based in 
Etchmiadzin, Armenia.  
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Tuesday at the Universal Hilton Hotel, Karekin said that the 
America depicted overseas in films is not the America he came to know as 
archbishop in New York before he became Catholicos. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have seen the American life, I have seen the principles, the moral stature 
of these American family lives, (the) belonging to a family and the moral 
standards," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, he said, recent films -- unlike earlier pictures that he said 
depicted "authentic" human life, great ideals and dedication -- substitute 
technological violence for actors who are "personally present." 
</P>
<P>
 "All these artificial weapons and futuristic means of showing the destruction 
of the world -- nuclear annihilation and so forth -- are so unreal," he said. 
"They are directed toward violence, killings and sexual abuses, and different 
moral degradations. I must think . . . why all of this? I think it is all 
economic reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 He added, "Civilization and culture are two things. . . . Civilization in my 
own understanding is the presentation of the human life and expression of the 
human life in its most authentic human aspects -- not in the the ordinary walks 
of life that . . . are shared by the animals that we respect," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He questioned how much of the world's cultural greatness was reflected in 
films. "Not much," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked what he would say to Hollywood executives if he had the opportunity, 
Karekin replied: "My appeal, if I can, to my American brothers and sisters of 
high responsibility is to think . . . of the people on the other end . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Karekin celebrated Christmas Eve service Wednesday night at St. Mary's 
Armenian Apostolic Church in Glendale. He is scheduled today to celebrate a 
Pontifical Divine Liturgy at 11 a.m. at Holy Martyr's Armenian Apostolic Church 
in Encino and preside at a traditional Christmas dinner at the Universal City 
Hilton Hotel at 7 p.m.

EAST VENTURA FOCUS: MOORPARK; COUNCIL REJECTS STREET RENAMING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Moorpark City Council rejected a proposal Wednesday to rename a stretch of 
Peach Hill Road to match that of a new middle school, citing the historical 
significance of the nearly 100-year-old thoroughfare. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't get behind an idea like this," Mayor Paul Lawrason said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the backing of the Moorpark school board, resident Kenneth Sherman had 
asked the council to rename the east-west section of Peach Hill Road to Mesa 
Verde Drive, after the middle school expected to open on the street next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Changing the name will not change the significance of Peach Hill Road to the 
past of the city. It will not change the history," Sherman said. "The request 
is a good idea, a good idea for the city, for the school district and for the 
students who will attend Mesa Verde school." 
</P>
<P>
 School board members voted unanimously last month to spend up to $1,000 to pay 
for new street signs if the city agreed to the change, which Sherman and school 
officials believe would make it easier for parents and students to find the new 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the street attending the meeting said the inconvenience of 
switching to a new street name outweighed any potential benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would name to change 62 things, would you like me to list them?" asked Nina 
Beaulieu, who has lived on the street since 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the week, the Moorpark Planning Commission voted unanimously to 
send council members a memo objecting to changing the name of one of the city's 
oldest streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The name of the street has historical significance in Moorpark and is 
inexorably tied to the Peach Hill area," commissioners wrote in the memo. "The 
Planning Commission would strongly recommend to the City Council that it not 
change Peach Hill Road to Mesa Verde." JAMES MAIELLA JR.

 Ventura City Councilman Jack Tingstrom has taken out papers to run for county 
assessor in June, elections officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tingstrom, a staunch conservative with extensive ties to Ventura's business 
community, will challenge acting assessor Glenn Gray for the position, which 
pays $102,781 annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Tingstrom is the third city official in Ventura County to announce his 
intentions to run for a county position. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo took out forms for the 
supervisorial seat representing county areas stretching from Oak Park to Port 
Hueneme. Supervisor Maria VanderKolk, who holds the position, has announced 
that she will not seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Several weeks ago, Simi Valley Mayor Greg Stratton announced that he will run 
against county Auditor-Controller Thomas O. Mahon for the $110,500-a-year slot. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Deadline to file for the June primary is March 11. Eight county positions, 
including sheriff and district attorney, will be up for election this year.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; CITY ECONOMIC BLUEPRINT UNVEILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT and SHELBY GRAD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan aimed at bolstering economic development was unveiled Wednesday by city 
and business leaders who hope it will serve as a blueprint for improving 
Irvine's sluggish economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Economic Development Strategic Plan focuses on luring new companies to the 
city, retaining existing ones, creating skilled, high-paying jobs and reducing 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideas for improving the business climate include marketing the city more 
aggressively both in Orange County and outside the state and luring more 
international companies and retailers to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the structure we have here is very solid," said Terry Hartman, 
president of the Irvine Chamber of Commerce, which helped devise the strategic 
plan with the city. "I think it makes us competitive with other communities." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan was discussed Wednesday morning at a Chamber of Commerce breakfast. 
Business leaders have long sought a public-private partnership focused on 
improving Irvine's once-booming economy, which has been mired in a slump over 
the past few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartman said several firms have left Irvine for other states and that job 
creation has been slow. That combined with the statewide recession has created 
a grim economic situation that has hit City Hall, where dozens of people were 
laid off last year because of reductions in tax revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartman and others hope the plan will help reverse this trend. 
</P>
<P>
 The 26-page document includes a list of Irvine's strengths, including a prime 
location in the center of Orange County, close proximity to UC Irvine, an 
educated work force and open space available for business expansions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Irvine is 50% developed," said Larry Larsen, executive assistant to the city 
manager. "For companies looking toward future expansion, we are an established 
community with opportunities for growth." 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen said about 65% of the recommendations in the report are already being 
used in some form by the city, including a $20,000 fund for economic 
development. But he said the city might have to allocate additional money if a 
more ambitious promotion campaign is desired. 
</P>
<P>
 Helping to implement the plan will be a series of teams whose members will 
represent business, the city, local schools and UCI.

program," Hartman said. Irvine Assets Irvine city officials and business people 
on Wednesday discussed a new plan to create jobs and improve the city's

COUUNTYWIDE FOCUS: CAMARILLO CHILDREN'S CENTER GETS LEADER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A La Crescenta man has been named executive director of a $10-million 
Camarillo facility for abused and neglected children. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Elson, 48, now executive director of an Altadena residential facility 
for abused and neglected boys, was selected from among 110 applicants to head 
Casa Pacifica, which is scheduled to open in late spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Elson, who will begin work at the Camarillo facility March 1, holds a 
doctorate in counseling psychology from Michigan State University. He has 
headed the Altadena facility the past nine years and is president of California 
Mental Health Advocates for Children and Youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Casa Pacifica is expected to provide shelter and psychological help to an 
estimated 300 to 500 neglected children each year in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, neglected or abused children are housed in various county 
facilities until they enter a foster home. Once Casa Pacifica is open, they 
will be housed there until they are reunited with their families or enter 
foster care. 
</P>
<P>
 Elson said Casa Pacifica, conceived nearly a decade ago, could become an 
example nationwide of how the private and public sectors can work together. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that given that kind of partnership between the public and the 
private sector, it has a potential not only to serve the neglected children and 
their families, but it may also create some kind of national model so other 
communities will know how it can be done," Elson said.  
</P>
<P>
 Casa Pacifica will be hiring additional staff members in April. CHRISTINA LIMA

COUUNTYWIDE FOCUS: MEMBER IS OUSTED FROM AIDS GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A countywide group that distributes federal money for AIDS- and HIV-care 
services has expelled a member they say erroneously accused the group of 
wrongdoing in letters to the media and political officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Ventura County HIV Care Consortium voted unanimously Wednesday 
to oust Claire Connelly, president of The Resource Center in Camarillo, from 
the umbrella group.The consortium's executive committee recommended the action 
last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Edie Brown, the consortium's chairwoman, said after the vote that Connelly 
"has her own private agenda and the consortium doesn't want to hear it 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said the group's directors were upset over letters Connelly had sent to 
area newspapers and Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) alleging financial 
improprieties by the consortium. "She was accusing the consortium of violating 
its own funding rules," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said a recent internal audit of all the agencies that receive funds from 
the consortium indicated that Connelly's claims of financial misuse were false. 
</P>
<P>
 Connelly attributed her removal to the influence of gay activists in the 
consortium. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gay caucus is trying to diminish the role of The Resource Center and my 
role in the gay community," said Connelly, who had long been at odds with Brown 
and others in the area's community of gay activists. 
</P>
<P>
 Connelly has contended that it is improper for the gay-oriented groups in the 
consortium to receive public funding to fight AIDS. "I don't think it is 
healthy for the gay civil-rights movement to be identified with AIDS," Connelly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown denied that the consortium ousted Connelly because of a division in the 
ranks of gay activists. 
</P>
<P>
 "The consortium is not a gay group and AIDS is not a gay disease," Brown said. 
"The consortium needs to get back to the needs of our HIV-infected community."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: TUSTIN; SEWAGE SLUDGE SPILL CLOSES RED HILL AVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Morning rush-hour traffic along a stretch of Red Hill Avenue was snarled for 
several hours Wednesday after about four tons of treated sewage sludge spilled 
from a truck, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The spill forced commuters to be routed onto Tustin Ranch Road and resulted in 
a rush-hour backup of about a mile.Red Hill Avenue reopened at 9:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 A driver for a Redlands-based agricultural company, which recycles the sludge 
into fertilizer, was hauling about six tons of the sewage in a tractor-trailer 
when the spill occurred at 1:58 p.m. near the Santa Ana Freeway, said Tustin 
police Lt. Houston Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "The driver said he had to slam on his brakes to avoid hitting another car 
which apparently ran a red light," Williams said. "The sudden stop caused the 
sludge to shift forward." 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, David Littlejohn, 51, was not injured during the incident but was 
bathed in sludge when some of it sloshed through the back window of his truck 
cab, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Littlejohn, a driver for Pima Gro Systems Inc., had picked up the sewage from 
the Orange County Sanitation District's Fountain Valley plant and was on his 
way to the company's processing facility in Riverside County, said Joe Dunagan, 
manager for technical services.GREG HERNANDEZ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; SCHOOL DISTRICT SUED BY UNION PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange Unified School District's legal troubles mounted Wednesday when the 
president of the classified employees' union filed a suit saying administrators 
ousted her in retaliation for her union work. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's action follows a lawsuit filed last month by three of the 
district's top administrators, who are seeking $20 million each in damages 
against the district for alleged invasion of privacy, defamation, emotional 
distress and damage to their reputations following an investigation into 
alleged sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest suit alleges that union president Becky Mayers, 52, was removed 
from her job as a delivery driver because of an administrative "vendetta" 
against her. The suit seeks reinstatement and $2.1 million in damages plus 
punitive damages from the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges that Chief Fiscal Officer Joyce Capelle wanted to "get rid 
of" Mayers. Capelle is one of the three administrators who is suing the 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Capelle and other district officials, however, said political motivations 
played no role in removing Mayers, who has served as union president for 15 of 
the last 16 years. Rather, the district says, the action was taken because 
Mayers has back and shoulder ailments and could no longer meet the physical 
requirements of the position. 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly don't have a vendetta against Becky," Capelle said. "It certainly 
would not be my decision (to move her out of her job) anyway. This is the 
outcome of lawyers versus lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
 Capelle and other district officials have frequently clashed with classified 
union officials over the last three years, during which $11.5 million has been 
slashed from the district's budgets. The cutbacks have resulted in layoffs of 
teachers and classified personnel, and in increased class size. 
</P>
<P>
 Other district officials contacted Wednesday would not comment on the suit 
since it involves a personnel issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Capelle, the suit names the district's head of human resources, 
Jack Elsner, as an administrator responsible for Mayers' removal in May. Elsner 
was unavailable for comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit acknowledges that Mayers suffers from back and shoulder problems but 
alleges that the district failed to accommodate her. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the stress of losing her job, Mayers is undergoing psychological 
counseling, the suit says. Mayers has been working as a school bus driver since 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 The earlier suit alleges that the district failed to accommodate the medical 
condition of Deputy Supt. Richard L. Donoghue, who underwent a liver transplant 
last year. MARTIN MILLER

EAST VENTURA FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; ACTIVISTS FOR DISABLED CRITICIZE PLAZA 
ACCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two disabled rights activists, long critical of Thousand Oaks' efforts to 
ensure wheelchair accessibility in all public and private buildings, have 
presented the City Council with a list of complaints about the Civic Arts Plaza 
now under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Branagan, the city's building and safety director, said the $64-million 
auditorium and government center meets or beats all federal standards for 
disabled access.However, he promised to send the complaints to the Civic Arts 
Plaza's architects for response. 
</P>
<P>
 In angry speeches before the City Council on Tuesday night, Phyllis and John 
Ellis complained that the Civic Arts Plaza design relies too heavily on 
wheelchair lifts, small platforms that carry disabled patrons up and down steep 
slopes. Calling the lifts "degrading and inferior," John Ellis said some 
motorized scooters cannot fit on standard-sized lifts. 
</P>
<P>
 He also told the council: "You have carried on the grand history of relegating 
wheelchair users to inferior seating." 
</P>
<P>
 But Branagan said wheelchair-bound audience members could choose among a 
variety of ticket prices and seating locations. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government requires 21 spaces for wheelchairs in an 1,800-seat 
auditorium such as Thousand Oaks', but the city chose to provide 30, he said. 
None of those spaces are in the center of the theater, since by law wheelchair 
patrons must be seated near an exit, Branagan said. STEPHANIE SIMON

GOOD SCOUT'S TROUBLES MAY HAVE SILVER LINING; RESCUE: THREAT OF FINE FROM 
HOMEOWNERS' GROUP OVER HIS CB RADIO USE SPURS OFFERS OF LEGAL AID, MONEY, MORAL 
SUPPORT. THE EXPLORER HAD AIDED SIX STRANDED BOATERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Offers of legal aid, money and moral support came in Wednesday for Richard 
Wright, the Explorer Scout who faces a possible fine from his homeowners' 
association, supposedly for using a citizen's band radio to help save six 
stranded boaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Melbourne Aitken, a retired teacher from Glendale who read a story about 
Wright's situation in The Times, said he's willing to pay the $150 fine against 
the 20-year-old Scout. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have compassion for this kid," Aitken said. "I helped start an Explorer 
post with Glendale police some years back and I've worked with Explorers and 
that's what really brought my attention to this thing." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a teacher and he just showed such a willingness to help someone else, 
that if he gets fined, I'm willing to pay the money," Aitken added. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright received at least a dozen calls throughout the day, including other 
offers to pay the fine and calls from lawyers who want to represent him before 
the association board, which will decide next Wednesday whether to impose the 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 28, Wright and two other CB radio operators heard a distress call from 
a boat five miles off Dana Point. Six people aboard the vessel, which had 
engine problems, were later rescued after Wright helped a Coast Guard 
helicopter locate the boat. 
</P>
<P>
 His action resulted in a commendation letter from a high-ranking Coast Guard 
official. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wright got in trouble with the homeowner's association, which had been 
after him to stop using his CB in the 124-unit condo complex because other 
residents complained it caused interference with their cordless telephones and 
television reception. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after he helped save the boaters, he was notified about the fine. 
Wright claims he is being punished for using the CB in the rescue, but Ron 
Meixsell, president of Moulton Parkway Assn. No. 1, said the youth is being 
fined for radio use before the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Meixsell said he has received two homeowner complaints against the youth 
related to television and telephone interference that allegedly occurred on 
Dec. 24 and 29. Wright denied he used his radio on those dates. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, as his notoriety increased, Wright has vowed to fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to get an attorney and file a lawsuit," he said. "I think they're just 
harassing me and my family for what I did and all I did was help someone."

DENNY TRIAL JUDGE REMOVED FROM RIOT-RELATED CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge John W. Ouderkirk, who presided over the Reginald O. 
Denny beating case, lasted about five minutes Wednesday as the judge in the 
last unresolved case stemming from incidents at Florence and Normandie avenues 
at the start of the Los Angeles riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Ouderkirk had just begun a pretrial hearing in the case of a man accused of 
shooting at Denny's truck, other vehicles and a gas pump on April 29, 1992, at 
the corner when one of the defendant's lawyers objected to his presiding. 
</P>
<P>
 Chokwe Lumumba used his legal right to eliminate one judge in the case to ask 
for a reassignment. The prosecutor also gets a chance to remove a judge, but 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Kevin McCormick said he has no problem with the 
reassignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ouderkirk obliged Lumumba and the case against Lance Parker, 28, was 
reassigned to Superior Court Judge Florence-Marie Cooper. Lumumba said he took 
the action because he believes Ouderkirk could not give his client a fair trial 
based on the judge's actions in the trial last year of Damian Monroe Williams 
and Henry Keith Watson, whom a jury found guilty of some charges related to the 
beating of Denny and others.

EDELMAN ACCEPTS $5,000 RAISE THAT COLLEAGUES HAVE GIVEN UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA RIVERA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calling it a question of fairness, retiring Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed 
Edelman said Wednesday he will accept a $5,000 annual pay raise that his 
colleagues have decided to give up. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors Gloria Molina, Mike Antonovich, Yvonne Brathwaite Burke and Deane 
Dana have said that it would send the wrong message to accept more money during 
a time of budgetary belt-tightening. They have said that they will donate their 
raises to the county or to charities. 
</P>
<P>
 But Joel Bellman, a spokesman for Edelman, said the supervisor feels his 
decision is justified because he, like his colleagues on the board, has not 
received a pay increase in three years. Bellman also noted that Edelman, like 
other county employees, agreed to defer 2% of his pay through the end of the 
fiscal year June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "He feels that's an adequate symbol of his willingness to contribute," Bellman 
said. "Ed has never been one to engage in empty gestures. He believes in taking 
substantive actions." 
</P>
<P>
 Edelman, whose fifth term ends Dec. 5, said in November that he will not seek 
reelection. Bellman said Edelman still would have accepted the raise even if he 
were running for office. 
</P>
<P>
 The pay increase, which took effect Jan. 1, will raise each supervisor's base 
salary from $99,297 to $104,262. The increase will boost Edelman's pension by 
about $3,000 annually. Bellman noted that the other supervisors may be giving 
up their pay increases, but their base salaries and therefore their pensions 
also will increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a 1953 charter amendment, supervisors' salaries are tied to those of 
Superior Court judges, who in turn receive the same raises as state employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The four other supervisors say they decided not to simply waive the salary 
increase because they would still be liable to pay taxes on it. Instead, Molina 
intends to write a check to the county's general fund, while Antonovich, Burke 
and Dana will give the extra money to charities, their aides said.

PROHIBITION ON BAGGY CLOTHING IS PROTESTED; EDUCATION: STUDENTS SAY AN OAK PARK 
SCHOOL'S BAN IS UNREASONABLE. THE PRINCIPAL SAYS IT'S FOR THEIR OWN PROTECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 When Brooke Murphy returned to school Wednesday after an extended Christmas 
vacation, she sported the latest in teen-age fashion: men's boxer shorts 
peeking over the waistband of baggy blue jeans slung low over her hips. 
</P>
<P>
 She picked the outfit herself, she said, and her parents paid for it as a 
Christmas present. Brooke made the choice despite a notice sent home right 
before the vacation that there would soon be a new rule at Oak Park's Medea 
Creek Middle School: no excessively baggy clothing allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's stupid," said Brooke, 14, an eighth-grade student at Medea 
Creek. "You should be able to dress the way you want." 
</P>
<P>
 Medea Creek Principal Laurel Ford and some parents worry that the oversized 
pants that drag along the floor resemble clothing worn by gang members, and 
that Medea Creek students might mistakenly become targets of gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're saying it's not safe for kids to dress like gang members in a society 
where gang members commit so much violence," said Ford, noting that other 
Ventura County districts have banned oversized clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is really ridiculous to be outraged about something that protects our 
children," said parent Carla Gramig, whose sixth-grade son goes to Medea Creek. 
"In this day and time, you have to be careful." 
</P>
<P>
 But parent Paul Felger, whose has a son in the eighth grade at Medea Creek, 
said he was concerned that the guidelines will infringe on his child's right to 
freedom of expression. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm opposed to dress codes unless they're voluntary," Felger said. "What if 
gangs all of a sudden decided to wear suits and ties? This should be between 
parents and the child." 
</P>
<P>
 Notice of the new guidelines was sent home to parents shortly before Christmas 
vacation, which was extended until Wednesday to give teachers two planning and 
training days. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines are scheduled to go into effect Feb. 1, but Ford said parents 
were given advance notice in hopes that they would refrain from buying their 
children baggy clothing as gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford said students are asked "to wear clothes as intended by the 
manufacturer." According the rules, that means the waistline should be at the 
waist, not at the hips. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, the guidelines prohibit pants that are torn or drag along the 
ground; outfits that show underwear or "private parts"; clothes that look like 
underwear; strapless tops; shoes without backs; hats, and shirts with foul 
language or with pictures that advertise alcohol, cigarettes or illegal 
substances. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, the rules state, a student's appearance "may not create a 
disturbance." 
</P>
<P>
 Ford said parents of students who violate the dress code will be contacted, 
with the hope that they can be persuaded to cooperate once the rules are 
further explained. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, some students -- most of them dressed in baggy pants -- 
complained that the dress code was intrusive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like it," said Anna Travis, 13, an eighth-grader whose black baggy 
pants slung way below her waist. "I have to go out and buy a whole new 
wardrobe." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Brooke, "Not everyone who dresses like this is in a gang. There are no 
gangs at Medea Creek." 
</P>
<P>
 "I go back to when I was in the 11th grade and they did away with dress 
codes," said Marti Ketchum, who was one of the parents responsible for helping 
determine the guidelines. "It was all peace and love. This is not a close 
parallel to that. Things are more dangerous now."

50 EMPLOYEES TO LOSE JOBS IN BANK TAKEOVER; THOUSAND OAKS: BY APRIL 8, FOUR OF 
THE FIVE LOCATIONS WILL CLOSE, WITH ACCOUNTS MOVED TO NEARBY FIRST INTERSTATE 
BRANCHES.

 Four of five First State Bank of the Oaks branches will close and about 50 
employees will be out of work by April 8 as First Interstate Bank of California 
finalizes its takeover of the Thousand Oaks-based bank, First Interstate 
officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The branches that will close -- in Westlake Village, Thousand Oaks, Simi 
Valley and Camarillo -- are within 1 1/2 miles of a First Interstate branch, 
said Rich Wyler, a bank spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The one branch that will remain open, at 753 N. Wendy Drive in Newbury Park, 
will be converted to a First Interstate branch April 8, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other branch buildings are leased from various owners, and First 
Interstate will continue paying rent until the leases expire, Wyler said. 
</P>
<P>
 The closures are part of an ongoing consolidation in the area's banking 
business. Earlier this week, Great Western Bank announced that it would close 
four Ventura County branches of HomeFed Bank, which Great Western acquired from 
the federal government last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Under its takeover deal announced in August, First Interstate agreed to pay 
$23 million to acquire Bank of the Oaks, Wyler said. The deal is expected to be 
finalized Wednesday. However, officials will wait nearly another three months 
before closing the four Bank of the Oaks branches, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four branches that are closing employ 85 people, 33 of whom will be 
offered jobs at other First Interstate branches in the county, Wyler said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other 52 employees face layoff April 8 but will have access to First 
Interstate's internal job-placing network for six months and will be given the 
same job placement priority that other bank employees have over outsiders 
applying for bank jobs, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said those facing layoffs will be given two to four weeks severance 
pay for each year they were with Bank of the Oaks, which opened in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 First Interstate officials met with Bank of the Oaks employees Wednesday to 
discuss the branch closings, Wyler said. "There weren't a lot of surprises 
because people were aware of the proximity of the branches," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Bank of the Oaks customers, First Interstate mailed them letters 
Wednesday explaining what First Interstate branch their account will transfer 
to, Wyler said. All Bank of the Oaks customers will receive new checks, a new 
ATM number and six months of free checking when their branches close or switch 
over to First Interstate on April 8, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With $148 million in assets, Bank of the Oaks is the third largest independent 
bank in Ventura County. It reported a net profit of $737,000 in the first nine 
months of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 First Interstate, in contrast, counts $48.9 billion in assets and reported a 
net profit of $150 million in the first three quarters of last year. Before 
acquiring Bank of the Oaks, First Interstate had seven branches in Ventura 
County and, with recent acquisitions, has about 400 branches statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 First State Bank of the Oaks was started nearly 14 years ago by Fred Raio, who 
left his job as a regional manager for First Interstate to open a bank in the 
Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it would be a good local business," Raio said. 
</P>
<P>
 Raio said the small bank's shareholders finally agreed to sell it to First 
Interstate when the massive, statewide bank made them an offer too good to 
refuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a very successful bank, but it seemed in the best financial interest 
of all involved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Raio, 60, said he does not plan to remain with First Interstate after April 8, 
and may retire or move on to another job.

<P>
 An unidentified person was killed and a car severed in a freeway crash 
Wednesday night, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the car was left in a traffic lane, with the remainder on the 
shoulder, according to a California Highway Patrol dispatcher. The occupant of 
the car died en route to the hospital.

<P>
 The accident occurred at 9 p.m. and involved a second car, the CHP said. 
Information on that driver was not immediately available.  
</P>

AUTO MALL'S REVISED SIGNBOARD OKD IN A TESTY COUNCIL SESSION; THOUSAND OAKS: 
MEETING IS MARKED BY AN HOUR AND A HALF OF BARBS AND ACCUSATIONS BY MEMBERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The issue seemed cut and dried: Did the revised sketches for an Auto Mall sign 
match the Thousand Oaks City Council's previously imposed standards? 
</P>
<P>
 But that basic question was nearly obscured during a rancorous, 90-minute 
debate Tuesday night, filled with backbiting that prompted a few spectators to 
cheer and hoot as though they were watching a football game. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the Auto Mall dealers received permission to erect the sign, which 
will feature a copper-and-blue globe atop two stucco pillars and a small 
electronic message board displaying the time and temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the 3-2 vote late Tuesday night, however, council members spent an hour 
and a half accusing one another of grandstanding, spreading rumors and cutting 
off public comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of embarrassed for our council that disruptive politics are being 
played with no regard to democratic processes," Councilman Frank Schillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The mud-flinging prompted Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce President Steve 
Rubenstein to publicly chastise the council. "I just don't understand where 
this council is going -- it's almost embarrassing. I'm supposed to tell people 
outside this community to come here and bring their concerns to this council?" 
</P>
<P>
 The insults and innuendoes began moments after Mayor Elois Zeanah hit the 
gavel to open the council's first meeting of the new year. 
</P>
<P>
 The council had been scheduled to take up the sign debate during its 5 p.m. 
session, which is reserved for non-controversial staff reports. A majority of 
council members considered the issue non-controversial because a 3-2 vote last 
month guaranteed Auto Mall dealers approval of a new sign, provided it met size 
and location standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually when the council puts conditions on an approval, city staff takes 
responsibility for monitoring compliance. Yet in this case, because the Auto 
Mall proposal had sparked such a loud public debate, the council decided to 
verify firsthand that the redesign met its standards. 
</P>
<P>
 That discussion, however, swiftly veered off course Tuesday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Zeanah announced that she would push the Auto Mall issue to later in 
the agenda so interested citizens could be on hand after work. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, she shut off the microphone as attorney Chuck Cohen tried to explain the 
time and temperature feature of the new sign. Zeanah declared that she had not 
recognized Cohen at the podium and therefore he was out of order. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "That is absolutely discourteous," Councilman Alex Fiore responded to a burst 
of applause from the dozen Auto Mall supporters gathered in council chambers. 
"I don't know of any mayor who has deliberately turned off the mike when a 
member of the public was trying to speak." 
</P>
<P>
 Tempers flared again when Zeanah said she had heard rumors that the Auto Mall 
dealers were plotting to build a bigger, flashier sign next year -- assuming 
the 1994 elections swept in a more pro-business council. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is a disreputable diatribe on your part," Councilwoman Judy Lazar 
snapped. "It's unbelievable. We're now going to report on all the rumors 
running around this city? That's unreal." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Lazar told the mayor: "I'd like to compliment you on your grandstanding 
this evening." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with dishing out criticism, Lazar took her share of blows. 
</P>
<P>
 As the council member closest to the Auto Mall issue, Lazar has tried to 
negotiate a compromise between the dealers, who want a highly visible sign, and 
residents, who complain that a tall electronic billboard would mar views along 
the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski joined Zeanah in accusing Lazar of 
acting as the Auto Mall dealers' advocate. They complained repeatedly at the 
meeting that Lazar had provided only scanty information to the public and the 
council about the revised design. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Auto Mall dealers had been ready with their new proposal by late 
December, they turned in site plans and sketches to the city planning 
department only hours before Tuesday's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Turning to Lazar in anger, Zukowski said: "You were privy to information that 
the public doesn't know, we don't know -- only you know. Our own staff didn't 
even know." 
</P>
<P>
 Lazar said she regretted that the sketches were not available for public 
viewing until Tuesday afternoon. But she rejected Zeanah's claim that she was 
using her council seat to speak for the Auto Mall dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been speaking as a council member who tried to achieve a reasonable 
solution to a sensitive issue," Lazar said. "We as a council are elected to try 
to achieve solutions, not to throw stones."

COMMENTARY; SKIPPING AROUND FOR A MEANINGFUL EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE KINDRED, THE SPORTING NEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At 11:03 a.m. on New Year's Day, with the zapper strapped to a wrist, your 
obedient servant surfed onto the Travel Channel at which time YOS was heard to 
scream, "No more egg nog for me!" He had seen a sight so terrible as to make 
his earlobes tremble. 
</P>
<P>
 There on the TV were gangs of John Kruks and Lenny Dykstras, dozens of Kruks, 
a mad scientist's cloned creatures with bellies and beards. Brown liquids 
spilled over the Dykstras' lips onto their pinstripes. Your obedient servant 
was heard to scream, "Drool alert! Get the kids into the basement. And no more 
egg nog for me!" 
</P>
<P>
 So began New Year's Day in the Kindred padded cell where, to some relief, it 
was explained that these Kruks and Dykstras were not clones but costumed 
revelers in Philadelphia's Mummers parade, an annual event of farce, parody and 
other forms of higher truth. Fifty-five minutes later, the University of 
Michigan football team scored the day's first touchdown on a 26-yard run around 
right end. A macho videot snarled into his microphone, "That's smash-mouth 
football." 
</P>
<P>
 At 1:36 p.m., someone else snarled, "Smash-mouth football." 
</P>
<P>
 At 2:11: "They're playing smash-mouth now." 
</P>
<P>
 At 2:32: "They're hitting 'em right in the face." 
</P>
<P>
 At 7:58, Mike Ditka's mustache twitched with delight as he said, "They stuck 
it right in their face." 
</P>
<P>
 Your obedient servant retired to the closet about then and returned to his 
easy chair only after finding a cage-mask helmet with a Darth Vader visor. He 
tightened the chinstrap until it hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirteen hours of New Year's Day television and all they decided was the 
national championship of jump-roping. Yes, they did. You bet. You may have 
missed it on ESPN. It came down to one last maneuver, a mule kick. Maybe never 
in its history has the national championship of the American Double Dutch 
League been settled so spectacularly. It happened at 2:51 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching the events unfold, this zapper was mesmerized so completely that he 
forgot to write down the name of the winning team. He did make a note of the 
winning coach's remarks. She said her girls knew they needed to do their 
academic work because Double Dutch "is not something you can do the rest of 
your life." 
</P>
<P>
 We're talking the sixth-grade singles here. We're talking the mountain climb, 
inversions, inverted claps, rapid dance, aerial entries and mule kicks. Teams 
brought their rope-swingers and rope-jumpers to one gymnasium to determine in 
head-to-head competition, once and for all, the best Double Dutch jumpers in 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this a great country or what? 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for reasons known only to the preposterous panjandrums who run college 
athletics, we can watch 13 hours of New Year's Day bowl games and come away 
with only a suggestion as to the identity of the national college football 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
 We zap along from the day's first touchdown at 11:58 a.m. to the last sad kick 
at 12:26 a.m. and we learn only four things for sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Smith can eat potato chips a mittfull at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Ditka looks so cute sitting under party balloons and confetti. 
</P>
<P>
 Once every 15 minutes television announcers must snarl about smash-mouth 
football or the network loses its license to broadcast any more smashing of 
mouths. 
</P>
<P>
 People who watch football buy cars and trucks, beer and orange juice, shaving 
gel, the U.S. Army, credit cards, steak and seafood, cough medicine, pizza, 
computers and VCRs, beer, soup, telephones, tires and auto parts, workout 
machines, stomach medicine, hand tools, rental cars, beer, soap and 
antiperspirant, headache medicine, insurance, airline tickets, beer, flu 
medicine, batteries, dishwashers and more beer. Mothers Against Drunk Drivers 
also bought a commercial, a whisper in an explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 What we don't know is the answer to the question raised by a long season 
leading to one long day in front of the tube: Who's the champeen? 
</P>
<P>
 Florida State won the Package Delivery Orange Bowl. But for YOS, the Florida 
State two-point victory over Nebraska didn't carry enough weight to offset the 
team's seven-point loss at Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame won the Oil Company Cotton Bowl. But its three-point victory over 
Texas A&M should persuade no one to ignore its two-point loss to Boston College 
at Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 A zealot could make a case for Boston College, winner of the Carburetor and 
Crankshaft Bowl. B.C. won at Notre Dame when Florida State couldn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than fill the air with bilious heat, wouldn't it make sense for the 
college football people to put on a little tournament to decide all this? 
</P>
<P>
 But it is, as we all know, silly to expect any common sense from the college 
folks. They lie to keep in practice. A century of prevarication has taught us 
that the college folks wouldn't know the truth if it smashed them in the mouth. 
They operate only to make as much money as they can. All other justifications 
for big-time college football are lies, a few of them little white ones. 
</P>
<P>
 So, to perpetuate the money-making machine that the bowl games have been for 
all these years, the college folks refuse to go to a playoff. Not that the fate 
of the republic depends on determining such a champion. But if the public and 
the media insist, as they do, on making a hullabaloo about which team deserves 
the championship, here's what should be happening this week: 
</P>
<P>
 Florida State against Boston College. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame against Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 Put one game in the Rose Bowl, the other in the Orange Bowl. The winners would 
meet in the Georgia Dome the week before the Super Bowl there. It would be a 
big week on the tube, what with both football and jump-roping.

 Staying Together was the best harness racehorse in North America in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The result of voting by the United States Harness Writers Assn. and North 
American Harness Racing Secretaries Assn. was about as surprising as the 
outcome of most of Staying Together's races.

 Staying Together received 181 of the 277 votes cast for Harness Horse of the

 The Washington Redskins are interested in Dallas offensive coordinator Norv 
Turner as their new coach, but NFL rules prohibit them from talking to Turner 
until the Cowboys have been eliminated from the playoffs. . . . Houston 
defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan is interested in either of the NFL's two 
coaching vacancies at Washington or Atlanta. "I'd like to talk to anybody who 
has a head coaching job available," Ryan was quoted in Wednesday's Houston 
Chronicle."Maybe we can win the Super Bowl, and somebody will be interested in 
me." . . . Detroit running back Barry Sanders, who sprained his left knee in a 
Thanksgiving Day loss to the Chicago Bears, practiced for the first time 
Wednesday. If he feels right, Sanders will start Saturday when the Lions play 
host to Green Bay in a first-round NFC playoff game. . . . Cincinnati Bengal 
running back Harold Green said he would have no objections if the team uses its 
No. 1 draft choice to pick San Diego State running back Marshall Faulk.

 Staying with the hot back of the week, Coach Art Shell said Wednesday that Ty 
Montgomery would be his starting tailback for Sunday's wild-card playoff game 
at the Coliseum against the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 The starting fullback won't be decided until the availability of Steve Smith 
(ankle injury) is determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Raiders started a backfield of Randy Jordan and Napoleon 
McCallum. The week before, it was Nick Bell and Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he didn't start last week against the Broncos in the regular-season 
finale, Montgomery wound up as the Raiders' leading rusher with 44 yards in 13 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I wasn't ready when they called my number," Montgomery said, "it would 
have made me look bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the chance of a lifetime. This is what you dream about, what you 
fantasize about, what you come here for." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Rocket Ismail, who suffered a sprained neck Sunday, worked out Wednesday, but 
did not put on pads and participate fully in practice. He is listed as 
questionable for Sunday. Defensive lineman Nolan Harrison, who suffered a leg 
injury last Sunday but continued to play, sat out practice.

RECREATION / SKIING: PRACTICE MADE EASY MAKES SKIERS BETTER; BECAUSE SNOW IS 
NOT ESSENTIAL, DOWNHILL BUFFS CAN GET IN SHAPE WITHOUT LEAVING ORANGE COUNTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 What's the single best way to get ready for downhill skiing? 
</P>
<P>
 The best thing to do, say the experts, is . . . ski. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're a skier, you know -- the more you ski, the better," said Michael 
Cicchetti, an instructor at Sports Club/Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Obvious though it may sound, the sentiment was echoed by Terry Jarmon, manager 
of California Ski Center in Anaheim: "The best exercise to get ready for 
snow-skiing, is snow-skiing." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to machines, snow is no longer an essential ingredient, and ski buffs 
can work on their technique even in the warm months. California Ski Center in 
Anaheim, for example, has two indoor slopes, one that revolves like a large 
treadmill. Smaller versions of that machine can be found at some health clubs, 
including Sports Club/Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 As a personal trainer, Cicchetti works with several clients one-on-one on the 
club's "ski simulator." With no lift lines and theoretically endless runs, 
students can get in a lot of skiing in a little bit of time. Also, on the 
machine, it's easier to isolate and solve technical problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Cicchetti said he's working with one young client who's never actually been on 
a mountain yet, but has already mastered parallel turns. Once he gets onto real 
snow, he'll be ready to roar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Skiing should be fun," Cicchetti said. "You want to be able to just ski and 
have a good time when you get to the mountains." 
</P>
<P>
 There are ways to get in shape for the season that don't involve skiing the 
great indoors, however. According to Cicchetti, a conditioning routine 
undertaken before heading to the slopes can boost endurance and performance, 
and cut down on the muscle soreness that can follow a ski trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Cicchetti will be sharing some of his conditioning tips in a clinic at Sports 
Club/Irvine on Sunday from 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. (the clinic is open to the public 
at a cost of $15). In addition to taking part in Cicchetti's workout, 
participants will be able to view some of the latest ski equipment and talk to 
a physical therapist about avoiding injury. 
</P>
<P>
 While it's tempting to think that the legs do all the work in skiing, 
Cicchetti's program focuses on the whole body. "The more conditioned you are 
overall, the better off you are," he said. "It's not just leg exercises." 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, the 10-part circuit he teaches can be done at home with a minimum 
of equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the exercises, including one he calls the "ski ladder" (a sort of 
hyper-intense variation of hopscotch) work on tendon strength and "quickness 
and explosiveness," Cicchetti said, which helps speed reaction time and boosts 
performance in several aspects of skiing, from turns to negotiating moguls. 
</P>
<P>
 A two-person game of tug-of-war, done with a towel, works on balance and 
coordination. Other exercises, including push-ups, sit-ups and a workout on the 
slide board help other aspects of overall fitness. 
</P>
<P>
 The format of the circuit, meanwhile, helps to develop the short-burst 
"anaerobic" conditioning that comes into play in skiing, in which brief, 
intense workouts are interspersed with long periods of rest. Participants do 
each exercise for 30 seconds, with only 10 seconds to move to the next station. 
</P>
<P>
 "Twice through and you're pretty well worn out," Cicchetti said. 
</P>
<P>
 The circuit training is preceded by 20 minutes of warm-ups and stretches. The 
circuit can be modified for home training, or partially moved to weight 
machines for health club members. The key, as it is with any training regimen, 
is repetition. And while it's never too late to start, it's ideal to begin 
before the first snow falls and continue through the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to think about it ahead of time," Cicchetti said. 
</P>
<P>
 A ski fitness regimen called SkiFit, a program licensed through Proline USA, a 
sports marketing firm based in Seattle, applies many of the same principles of 
strength training that Cicchetti uses, while adding more cardiovascular 
training. The 24-session program starts with the recumbent cycle, moves to the 
treadmill and graduates finally to the stair-climber. 
</P>
<P>
 The program also emphasizes strengthening the muscles and ligaments of the 
thumb to head off a common complaint called "skier's thumb." 
</P>
<P>
 Cicchetti will lead a ski conditioning clinic Sunday, from 1:30 to 3:30 p.m. 
at Sports Club/Irvine, 1980 Main St. Fee for non-members is $15. Call (714) 
975-8400, Ext. 6501, for information.

 REI, an outdoor equipment store in Santa Ana, will hold a series of free 
clinics on Thursday nights this month for those who prefer cross-country to 
downhill skiing. On Thursday, cross-country basics are the topic of a talk by 
Dave Horine from the Pacific Wilderness Institute, an outdoor sports 
instructional center based in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 13, Leon Kolankiewicz will give a slide-illustrated talk about his 
weeklong ski tour of the Juneau Icefield in Alaska. "Layering for Comfort," 
about how to dress for a variety of winter activities, is the subject of the 
Jan. 20 presentation. And on Jan. 27, Gene Mezereny (author of a guide to local 
cross-country skiing locations) will share tips on equipment and where to ski. 
</P>
<P>
 All talks begin at 7 p.m. The store is at 1411 S. Village Way in Santa Ana. 
Information: (714) 543-4142.

 This time the dog really did eat the homework. But it was the teacher who had 
to explain it to her students. 
</P>
<P>
 Dee Slosser, a high school teacher in Port Clinton, Ohio, recently spent hours 
trying to piece together six advanced English placement tests that had been 
ripped to shreds by her dog. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'What am I going to do? These kids won't want to take this again.' 
They were sweating blood anyway the first time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Slosser worked all night to successfully piece the tests together and grade 
them.

 Spurs, a once-popular country dance nightclub in the Marina Pacifica mall, is 
being renamed and converted into a venue for live and recorded rock, 
alternative and disco music, according to general manager Jesse Cisneros. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros says the 6-month-old country format was dropped on New Year's Eve in 
hopes of drawing bigger crowds.The room will reopen Tuesday as Club Acapulco 
and will feature live local bands on Tuesday and Thursday nights. (Bogart's, a 
club in the same mall that had been a focal point of the area's live rock 
scene, closed last month.) 
</P>
<P>
 Spurs isn't the only club around here switching away from country. Cactus 
Jack's in Anaheim recently converted to Fritz That's Too, a semi-nude adult 
entertainment venue. 
</P>
<P>
 However, neither change signals an end to the country dance craze, according 
to Tom Mattox, a longtime dance instructor in Orange County who says his 
nightly classes continue to draw 600 people a week. 
</P>
<P>
 What's happening, Mattox says, is that smaller venues (with smaller dance 
floors) are being squeezed out while larger clubs are thriving. "When disco got 
real big," he recalled, "every club in the world turned into a disco, but it 
was the big clubs with the best music and biggest dance floors that lasted. 
It's the same thing with country." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, the news on the country dance front isn't all bad: The Silver 
Bullet in Long Beach, closed last fall, has reopened under new management as 
Bronco Billy's and is offering country dancing to live bands nightly. ZAN DUBIN

CITY MOVES TO PREVENT FLOODING IN CANYON; ENVIRONMENT: MALIBU WEIGHS OPTIONS, 
INCLUDING POSSIBLE SALE OF 28 PRIVATE LOTS TO FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR CONVERSION 
TO PARKLAND. RESIDENTS ARE IRATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN KELLEHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fires of November were simply the latest natural disaster to befall Las 
Flores Canyon. Every time it rains heavily, there's flooding. The area is also 
landslide-prone, and the Malibu earthquake fault is close by. And so it has 
occurred to some Malibu city officials that maybe, just maybe, people should 
not be living there.  
</P>
<P>
 The city, therefore, has begun to quietly explore a number of options, the 
most radical of which calls for federal acquisition of 28 lots in the canyon, 
at an average cost of about $500,000, and conversion of them into national 
parkland. The lots, of varying sizes, include remote hillsides, tracts with 
intact buildings, and remnants of the 10 homes and businesses destroyed in the 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's City Council meeting, council members are expected to authorize a 
study of the area and potential hazard abatement strategies, City Manager David 
Carmany said. Residents of the area were notified last week at a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 About 82% of the estimated $100,000 cost of the study will be borne by the 
state Office of Emergency Services and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
The city will cover the balance of about $18,000, said Carmany. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to city documents, the land acquisition is among several possible 
strategies for dealing with the canyon's hazards. Others include raising Las 
Flores Road, constructing a concrete channel for Las Flores Creek through the 
canyon, and reconfiguring the Pacific Coast Highway bridge over the creek at 
the foot of the canyon. Implementing all the measures would cost about $21 
million.  
</P>
<P>
 The November fires destroyed 10 homes and businesses in the canyon, and many 
experts say the bare hillsides left behind are a sign of another disaster 
waiting to happen. A heavy rain this winter would bring down tons of mud into 
the canyon.  
</P>
<P>
 Carmany pointed to the Dec. 21 storm that brought a quarter of an inch of 
rain. "And there was hundreds of tons of debris (in Las Flores Canyon) that 
came down," he said. Perhaps, he added, there may be options other than federal 
acquisition of lots. 
</P>
<P>
 But because the canyon appears to be a serious flood-hazard zone, Carmany 
said, it may be impossible for the city to issue permits allowing 
reconstruction of buildings destroyed in the fire. "It would be irresponsible," 
he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Predictably, residents of Las Flores Canyon, who met with city officials last 
week, are aghast. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a wonderful canyon full of wonderful people," said Susan Shaw, past 
president of Las Flores Canyon Residents Assn., whose apartment burned down in 
the Nov. 2 fire. "It's like the Topanga Canyon of Malibu. All this is 
speculation. . . . It depends on the rain we get.  
</P>
<P>
 "We all have river boots," Shaw added. If the canyon floods again this winter, 
"it wouldn't be the first time." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on information from a 1985 set of Federal Emergency Management Agency 
flood insurance maps, the city contends that the 10 properties in the lower 
portion of Las Flores Canyon that were burned in the fire lie within an area 
likely to be severely flooded by a "100-year" storm. Additional hazards exist 
because the canyon lies at the foot of the Rambla Pacifico landslide area, 
where major slides occurred in 1978, 1980 and 1983. Furthermore, about 50 homes 
on nearby Las Flores Mesa are in danger of isolation if Las Flores Canyon 
floods. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmany said it is a good time to address these problems because Malibu, as a 
result of the fire, has been declared a federal disaster area. The city and its 
residents are eligible for various forms of federal financial assistance during 
a period in which there is an imminent hazard of flooding -- defined as the 
duration of the rainy season. 
</P>
<P>
 Soil Conservation Service scientists have predicted that Las Flores Canyon and 
other burned areas will face the threat of mudslides, landslides and debris 
flows for four years or longer before enough vegetation has grown to 
restabilize the hillsides.  
</P>
<P>
 Maibu City Councilman Jeff Kramer said the proposed study would provide a 
preliminary look at some old problems that may have a number of solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know this is an emotional, complex issue for the residents who love that 
creek area," Kramer said. "To the extent that there is an opportunity for a 
federal acquisition of the Las Flores Creek area, I think we are obligated to 
follow up on it."

A FAMILIAR EXERCISE; HEALTH CLUBS BRACE FOR ANNUAL ONSLAUGHT OF NEW YEAR'S 
RESOLUTIONERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GORDON DILLOW, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It happens every year, as certain as death and taxes and the swallows 
returning to Capistrano. Vast multitudes of the hard-bodily-challenged will put 
down the chips and beer, switch off the tube, haul themselves off their couches 
and try to make good on that New Year's resolution to finally, finally get in 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
 They're called "resolutioners," and at health clubs across the Westside 
employees and patrons alike are bracing themselves for the onslaught of the 
thundering, flabby herd. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happens like clockwork," says Michael Neitzke, general manager of the 
Spectrum Club in Santa Monica, an upscale, pastels-and-chrome fitness center. 
"In January, club utilization will be up almost 50% more than what you usually 
see." 
</P>
<P>
 "All the health clubs are busy this time of year," says Rene Van Sauter, 
manager of L.A. Fitness in Marina del Rey. "It's a part of the business. You 
try to go to almost any club, especially the cheaper ones, and they'll be 
packed." 
</P>
<P>
 The annual post-New Year stampede to the health clubs is either bitter or 
sweet, depending on your perspective. It's sweet for health club owners, who 
collect new membership or "initiation" fees of up to $300 or more from the 
resolutioners, and/or monthly dues of $14 to $55 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 For the already hard-bodied veteran fitness club members, however, 
resolutioners are a pain in the taut, perfectly-shaped gluteus maximus. 
Especially in the 5 to 8 p.m. "prime time" hours, swarming resolutioners will 
tie up the treadmills, loiter on the exercise bikes, dally over the weight 
machines and in general make it tough to get an hour's workout in anything 
under an hour and a half. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh yeah, it's a lot more crowded this time of year," says Susan Molina-Beck, 
30, of Malibu, a sales representative for a medical supply company who works 
out two hours every day -- that's right, two hours -- at the Santa Monica 
Spectrum Club. "All the treadmills are full, you have to share all the 
machines. You can always spot (the resolutioners). They're the ones whose faces 
are all red and who can barely breathe." 
</P>
<P>
 "I usually try to (work out) early in the morning" to avoid the resolutioner 
crush, says Charlene Solomon, 44, a Cheviot Hills writer and veteran health 
clubber. "It's a lot more crowded now than usual." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the veterans insist that, despite the hassle, they wish the 
resolutioners well. Still, within the health club world the term "resolutioner" 
has assumed such pejorative overtones that these days no one will ever admit to 
being one. 
</P>
<P>
 One exception, sort of, is Santa Monica lawyer Mike Zweig. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I'm a resolutioner," says Zweig, 41, as he reads a newspaper while 
pedaling an exercise bike at the Spectrum Club. But he quickly adds, "Every 
year I resolve to keep going." Zweig, it turns out, has been working out for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is an upside to the annual resolutioner invasion, it is that lurking 
in the back of every health club veteran's mind is the certain knowledge that 
it will not last. Everyone knows that long before the flowers bloom in the 
spring, the majority, perhaps the vast majority, of resolutioners will be out 
of the clubs and snugly re-ensconsed on their couches. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll taper off by the end of the month," 33-year-old hospital administrator 
and veteran health clubber Annie Orders predicts confidently. "It always 
happens that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Most veteran health club patrons say the resolutioner dropout rate is near 
90%. Health club managers, perhaps predictably, are more optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be you'd have a 90% dropout rate," says Van Sauter of L.A. 
Fitness. "But these days, with people becoming more health conscious, I would 
say that probably 50% to 60% will stay with it. Our job is to make sure they 
stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the dropout estimates vary, everyone agrees that the soft-bodied 
stand no chance of firming up if they don't get off the couch. So if you made a 
New Year's resolution to get in shape, maybe you should head for the health 
club. 
</P>
<P>
 On second thought, maybe you should wait until, say, March. 
</P>
<P>
 It'll be a lot less crowded then.

SALTER REJECTS 3RD TERM: 'CHANGE IS IMPORTANT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Beverly Hills Mayor Maxwell H. Salter announced this week that he will not 
seek reelection to the City Council in April, saying eight years on the council 
is more than enough for any one official.  
</P>
<P>
 Salter, 73, disclosed his retirement plan in a brief speech at the start of 
Tuesday's council meeting. Two seats, the ones held by Salter and Councilman 
Robert K. Tanenbaum, are on the April 12 ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Salter said his family and supporters had encouraged him to run for a third 
four-year term because he brought business experience to city government, but 
he said he decided it was time for new leaders with new ideas.  
</P>
<P>
 "I am a firm believer in eight years and two terms of service," Salter said. 
"Change is important and healthy. After eight years, we begin to become too 
accepting of conditions, too willing to wait for progress and too much a part 
of the system. Experience is valuable, but fresh new approaches to 
problem-solving revitalize our city government." 
</P>
<P>
 Salter, who received a standing ovation from his council colleagues and people 
in the audience, said that although he will not be a candidate, he has "no 
intention of retreating from involvement in civic affairs." 
</P>
<P>
 Salter is chairman of Beno's Family Fashions, a 55-store clothing chain that 
he built starting with a single Army-Navy store in San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
 z He was first elected to the council in 1986 and reelected in 1990. He held 
the largely ceremonial post of mayor, which is rotated among the five council 
members, during the 1989-90 and 1993-94 fiscal years. 
</P>
<P>
 He cited among his accomplishments his efforts to make government more 
responsive to residents and his role in the passage of a $77-million school 
bond approved by voters last year.  
</P>
<P>
 Salter's announcement, which came two weeks after the opening of the 
qualifying period for council candidates, ensures that at least one new face 
will appear on the council after the April election. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, seven residents, including incumbent Tanenbaum, have taken out 
nominating papers.

HEALTH PLAN SUED OVER REJECTING TWINS' CARE; COURTS: A MOTHER OF TWO BOYS IS 
TAKING ACTION AGAINST BLUE SHIELD FOR REFUSING TO COVER HOME NURSING AT NIGHT, 
WHEN HER SONS ARE AT RISK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Covina mother of 7-year-old twin boys who risk the failure of their lungs 
and hearts every time they fall asleep has sued a health insurance company for 
refusing to pay for home nursing ordered by the twins' doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying that the boys' lives are in jeopardy, Linda Sarver filed a negligence 
and breach of contract lawsuit Wednesday in Los Angeles Superior Court against 
Blue Shield, the health insurer; the Public Employees Retirement System (PERS), 
which funds the insurance, and Healthmarc, which advises PERS on which claims 
it should pay. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the health organizations would comment on the lawsuit, which had not 
yet been served Wednesday morning. But a PERS official said the Sarvers' 
request for home-care payment to be resumed is still under appeal. The Sarvers' 
previous health insurance company had paid for home nursing nearly all the 
twins' lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The former health insurance was provided by the city of Beverly Hills through 
the boys' father, a Beverly Hills police lieutenant who lives in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Under that insurance, the nurses were paid through Oct. 31. The new insurance, 
which took effect when the Beverly Hills Police Officers Assn. switched medical 
plans as part of a new contract with the city, refused to pay for the nurses, 
but they continued working at reduced pay from the Sarvers until early 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court documents, Healthmarc told the Sarvers in early November 
that the boys needed only simple custodial care, which is designed to help 
patients meet basic living needs and is not covered by the PERS health 
insurance policy.  
</P>
<P>
 The boys' doctor, C. Michael Bowman of Childrens Hospital in Los Angeles, 
urged Healthmarc in a Nov. 4 letter to immediately restore the funding because 
the lives of Bradley and Steven Sarver depend on skilled nursing care. 
</P>
<P>
 "By refusing to cover their needed home care equipment and personnel, . . . 
you are markedly increasing the risk that an event will occur which makes 
either or both boys a vegetable or corpse," Bowman wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarver, who was recently elected to the Covina City Council, said that since 
she took over the boys' nighttime care, "I have not been getting sleep, and I 
feel like a walking zombie." She added that she is "not qualified to do what 
those nurses did," and that she has little time to pursue her career as a 
self-employed marketing specialist but is trying to keep up with council 
matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Since they were 6 weeks old, the twins have been hooked up to elaborate 
monitoring equipment that sounds an alarm when their heart rate or breathing 
slows. The nurses monitored the equipment and roused the boys dozens of times a 
night. Sometimes they had to perform cardiopulmonary resuscitation, according 
to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys have central nervous system disorders that sometimes cause their 
hearts and lungs to fail while they sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 The nurses' job had been to anticipate and respond to the boys' apnea, or 
cessation of breathing, and bradycardia, the slowing of the heart rate. 
Sometimes all they needed to do to revive the boys during one of their episodes 
was shake them. At other times, doctors say, the nurses had to administer 
oxygen or CPR.  
</P>
<P>
 "There have been nights where I have sat between both Steven and Bradley and 
employed almost constant stimulation to both in response to the almost 
continuous apnea and bradycardia episodes," one of their nurses, Faye Rogers, 
said in court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys lead near-normal lives when they are awake, attending Badillo 
Elementary School in Covina and playing baseball after school. But they can't 
stay over at slumber parties and are not allowed to play without a guardian. 
Doctors say the twins may outgrow the disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarver's attorney, Theresa Barta of the Claremont law firm of Shernoff, Bydart 
& Darras, said a hearing for a preliminary injunction that would force PERS to 
start paying for the nursing is set for Jan. 27.

A THEATRICAL LIFE WITHOUT ROAD SHOWS; STAGE: IN AN OFTEN-ROOTLESS PROFESSION, 
PLAYWRIGHT JERRY MAYER AND HIS PRODUCER-WIFE EMILY MAYER HAVE FOUND A MEASURE 
OF STABILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Life in the theater is so transient. As you move from city to city, you never 
stop long enough to put down any roots, and sometimes you don't even stay long 
enough to unpack a suitcase.  
</P>
<P>
 But for playwright Jerry Mayer and his wife, producer Emily Mayer, the rules 
of theatrical rootlessness seem to have been suspended.  
</P>
<P>
 They have lived in the same house in Pacific Palisades -- with ocean and 
mountain views -- for a quarter of a century. For much of their last half a 
dozen years, going to work has usually meant a short commute to the Santa 
Monica Playhouse, where a succession of Jerry Mayer's plays have been staged. 
The latest, "Killjoy: A Comedy of Terrors," has been playing there for seven 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Many audience members travel farther, coming from the San Fernando Valley and 
the South Bay to watch the romantic comedy/murder mystery about a woman who 
wants to do away with her ex-husband.  
</P>
<P>
 The Mayers have an even shorter commute to their separate offices in their 
rustic home, which was built by Jerry Mayer and includes several of his wood 
carvings. 
</P>
<P>
 Just outside his office is a wooden sign he made that says, "Writer in 
Training." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the sign, Mayer, 62, is a veteran of the entertainment business, with 
scores of TV credits spanning more than two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 He wrote episodes for shows such as "MASH," "All in the Family," "The Mary 
Tyler Moore Show" and "Tabitha." He worked as a story consultant for the 
long-running "Bob Newhart Show," was executive producer/writer for "The Facts 
of Life" and wrote for Mitzi Gaynor. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he is a playwright with a string of hits, all of which have been produced 
by his wife and presented at the quaint, 92-seat Santa Monica Playhouse.  
</P>
<P>
 Of his urge seven years ago to begin writing plays, Mayer said, "I decided I 
wanted to write something that was really my own work. You start to want to 
control your own artistry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always thought I should be writing movies and plays. It's scarier. . . . 
It's a whole new form. This has to be worthy of people paying money to come see 
it."  
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most playwrights, though, Mayer found success right away. His first 
comedy, "Almost Perfect," won a Dramalogue Award and ran for 15 months at the 
Santa Monica venue. Next came the long-running "Aspirin & Elephants," "A Love 
Affair," and now "Killjoy." 
</P>
<P>
 The first three plays, the Mayers said in a recent interview in their living 
room, were loosely autobiographical.  
</P>
<P>
 The two St. Louis natives met when he was 18 and she was 16. They married 
three years later and had three children. Jerry, while moonlighting doing 
cartoons and jokes for comedians such as Phyllis Diller, worked in his father's 
construction business until he and Emily moved to Los Angeles in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost Perfect" chronicles some of Jerry Mayer's work and marriage 
frustrations. "I guess I had the seven-year itch," he said. "It was a 
coming-of-age play . . . about a guy who falls in love with his wife. (He) has 
a terrific girl but it takes a while to realize it." Now Mayer is writing a 
screenplay version of "Almost Perfect." 
</P>
<P>
 With "Killjoy," Mayer has left autobiographical territory altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to strike out and write about other people," he said. In the play, 
Mayer has planted murderous thoughts into the mind of a fictional character, 
Carol Sterling. Carol considers Victor, her ex-husband, an "egocentric killjoy" 
and all-around bad person whose only redeeming quality is that he's a Cubs fan. 
</P>
<P>
 However facetiously, Jerry Mayer invites viewers to consider concocting a 
murder too. After all, he suggests, what enraged, divorced person, after 
wasting decades with a creep, hasn't had such killer thoughts? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're dealing with people like ourselves who feel the only answer is murder," 
Mayer said. "Could you or I get to the point where you do the deed?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Killjoy," directed by Chris DeCarlo, deals humorously with the guilt-ridden 
Carol's quandary. At one point, she frantically confides her sinful plans to an 
offbeat, sacrilegious priest, who in his endearing Irish brogue, dispenses 
unorthodox, ungodly advice -- the kind you might expect from Mel Brooks. Carol 
has turned to him for advice because her rabbi is "off on a male-bonding 
weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 The play also touches knowingly on a number of problems facing divorced 
couples. For instance, it focuses not only on the plight of the ex-wife, but 
also on the quandary of the offspring toiling in their father's business. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, for example, "a father who is so immersed in his business that he 
doesn't get a chance to do as good a job at parenting as he should," Mayer 
said. "These are all identifiable things."  
</P>
<P>
 While Jerry Mayer upholds the creative end, Emily Mayer oversees actors, 
casting and ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's really good at it," her husband said. "She has very good controls. . . 
. It takes a certain amount of humility as well. She will answer phones for a 
day if it requires it." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all there for the same purpose," Emily Mayer said. "'At the same time, 
we have a lot of fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband added: "It's like going to summer camp." 
</P>
<P>
 "Killjoy: A Comedy of Terrors," is performed at the Santa Monica Playhouse on 
Thursdays and Fridays at 8 p.m., Saturdays at 6:30 and 9:15 p.m., and Sundays 
at 7:30 p.m. Ticket information: (310) 394-9779.

OFFICERS MAY LOOK FUZZY, BUT THEIR MISSION TO HELP IS CLEAR

 Lately, many people heading into Pasadena -- including two Secret Service 
agents assigned to protect President Clinton on a recent visit -- have been 
stroking their chins and gawking at some of the city's finest. 
</P>
<P>
 What's that standing out so prominently on those faces? A Charlie Chaplin 
mustache? A goatee? A Van Dyke?  
</P>
<P>
 Since early November, Pasadena police officers have been letting their hair 
down a bit in a fund-raising effort to benefit Villa Esperanza, a local 
nonprofit agency that provides education and care for children and adults with 
special developmental needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one would ever have thought that we can raise $20,000 by growing a beard, 
but that's what we did . . . for the Vietnam War Memorial," said Police Chief 
Jerry A. Oliver, who is sporting a goatee again this year for another good 
cause. The beard has "speckles of white, which is unusual for a fairly young 
face," the 47-year-old chief said. "I look quite dapper," he added proudly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sexy," commented a woman passerby, who promised to donate money to the 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
 In its second annual Fuzz for Funds campaign, Pasadena officers hope to raise 
$30,000 for Villa Esperanza, contest organizer Janet Pope-Hinton said. 
Contestants pay a $30 entry fee for a chance to grow a mustache, a goatee, or a 
beard and they may wear them while on duty until Jan. 31 -- shaving day. 
</P>
<P>
 (Under the department's policy, officers may not sport facial hair, except for 
a well-trimmed mustache that must be kept above the corner of the mouth.)  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 People can support the fund-raising effort by voting with their dollars for 
their favorite fuzz. Each dollar buys a vote and you can vote as often as you 
like, Pope-Hinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The three officers who raise the most money in each category will receive a 
cellular phone, 13" color TV and a portable AM-FM cassette player donated by 
the Stereo House Co. of Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Female officers can designate a fellow officer or a man outside the department 
to grow hair on their behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am slightly jealous," said Officer Tory Riley, who believes there should be 
some sort of contest for female officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the men are trying to adjust to their new facial fuzz. "It didn't look 
as good at first, but two weeks later when it settles in, it looks great," 
Officer Tom Peterson said of his beard. "Except the wind sometimes tickles it." 
 
</P>
<P>
 Growing a beard isn't as easy for Officer Glenn Thompson, who "bearded" it for 
three weeks and has finally trimmed it into a goatee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so itchy," said Thompson, contorting his face. "And my wife complained 
it was too rough on her face. So I got up at 2 o'clock in the morning and 
shaved it off." 
</P>
<P>
 But he did get a couple of votes, the officer said, in the form of donations 
from those two Secret Service agents. 
</P>
<P>
 The contest has other benefits, too. "I can sleep an extra five minutes" by 
not having to shave, said Gilbert Ortiz, a 10-year police veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Vince Cantu didn't have a choice in this hairy matter. The five-year 
veteran cop said his girlfriend ordered him to grow his beard when she learned 
that the contest was on again this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone in Pasadena is totally happy about the new cop look. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am used to seeing police officers cleanshaven for 31 years," said Ellen 
Favarote, a clerk for the Pasadena Municipal Court. "It's funny to see them 
with facial hair now. But if it's for a good cause, that's OK."

THE POWER OF BALANCE; HEALTH: QI GONG IS A BLEND OF TAOIST AND BUDDHIST 
PHILOSOPHIES, BREATHING, MEDITATION AND MEDICINE. PITZER COLLEGE OFFERS A 
COURSE ON THE PRACTICE, WHICH EMPHASIZES THE SPIRITUAL AS WELL AS PHYSICAL 
ENVIRONMENT.

 The professor faces the 30 Claremont Colleges students scattered about the 
wide room. He jumps up and down, arms stiff at his sides, legs straight. The 
students laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Professor Si-Tu Jie then speaks in Chinese, and his interpreter, Sue Sheng, 
quickly translates his words. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we are not balanced, how can we move through life?" she asks. 
</P>
<P>
 Balance is one of the most elementary basics of qi gong, a blend of Taoist and 
Buddhist philosophies, breathing and meditation exercises and medicinal 
practices developed over 2,000 years in China. The discipline, Jie says, has 
influenced Asian art, philosophy, physiology, psychology and culture through 
its emphasis on acquiring knowledge through one's physical and spiritual 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 For two semesters, Jie, a certified qi gong master in China and head of the 
Shao-lin Wei-Tu Qi Gong School, has taught the Pitzer College class, "Nature, 
Movement and Meditation in Qi Gong," through the environmental studies 
department. He and the Pitzer College faculty who developed the course believe 
that it is the first and only academic qi gong class at a mainstream college. 
</P>
<P>
 Though many independent practitioners teach qi gong exercises in the San 
Gabriel Valley, the Pitzer course tries to teach students about qi gong's 
influence on Chinese civilization and its application to Western health 
practices, Jie said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Angeline Douvas, assistant medical professor at USC, spoke at an October 
conference at Pitzer with Jie. They compared Western and Eastern styles of 
medical treatment -- scientific and holistic. Jie's demonstration of qi gong's 
power had mixed results, Douvas recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 In a demonstration on two volunteers whose movements he tried to control 
without their seeing or touching him, one volunteer mimicked his movements, but 
the other did not. When the professor used qi gong on another volunteer, he 
correctly deduced a shoulder and knee injury but incorrectly diagnosed another 
ailment, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jie and Douvas concluded that patients should rely on Western medical 
technology and use aspects of qi gong -- herbs, teas, meditation and body 
awareness discipline -- as a supplement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the overwhelming feeling (at the conference) is that they (Eastern 
and Western practices) can complement each other," Douvas said. 
</P>
<P>
 She added that with the growing Asian population in Southern California, more 
Western doctors are accepting alternative health practices such as acupuncture. 
"Physicians have to be accepting . . . of patients' orientations and 
philosophical needs . . . and a large number of patients are going to be 
Asians." 
</P>
<P>
 The course's popularity reflects the trend. This fall, the original limit of 
20 was stretched to let 72 enrolled students get in. After the 
beginning-of-term shifts ended, about 30 students were still left, well over 
the typical Pitzer course size of 10 to 15. 
</P>
<P>
 For part of each class session, the students, some of them shoeless, stand in 
rows on the carpeted floor. Eyes closed, they slowly begin to raise their arms 
forward and upward in time to the delicate sound of a flute on tape. They try 
to breathe rhythmically. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the basic eight-minute drill, an integral part of each class. The 
drill is intended to induce a state between sleep and consciousness and relax 
the digestive system -- a state specifically called qi gong.  
</P>
<P>
 "You feel clearer in brain, body and spirit," said Harvey Mudd senior Mark 
Chalice after a class. Students from any of the Claremont Colleges can attend 
the qi gong class. 
</P>
<P>
 The drill is only the beginning of the practice of qi gong, said Jie, a trim 
man in his early 50s who has studied qi gong since childhood. He believes it 
takes at least 10 years of experience to be qualified to teach it. "To be a 
real master, you must devote your whole heart." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Jie, several major schools teach qi gong in China, but hundreds 
of other schools in both China and the United States are not completely true to 
the essence of the practice. "So few really carry the traditional and 
scientific way. So many just collect some exercises." 
</P>
<P>
 The theory behind qi gong includes the idea of an energy flow, or chi, which 
is channeled through various points of the body, called meridians. Acupuncture 
specifically pinpoints meridians. 
</P>
<P>
 In the class, which is given every Tuesday and Thursday afternoon for about 
two hours, students watched as Jie drew on the board Chinese characters and 
diagrams of the human body's energy flow. Calligraphy, painting, philosophy, 
even cuisine all share the qi gong concept of achieving balance within one's 
environment, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The course . . . brings a feeling and flavor of a different way of thinking 
of the world to the classroom," said Tom Ilgen, dean of faculty and political 
science professor. "We're not offering this as medical training but as a 
cultural experience."

TROLLEY'S END MAY BE BOOST FOR BLUE LINE; TRANSIT: SOME OFFICIALS VIEW MTA'S 
CANCELLATION OF COSTLY ELECTRIC BUS PROJECT AS NECESSARY BECAUSE FUNDS CAN BE 
REDIRECTED TO HIGHER PRIORITIES. 
</P>

<P>
 The decision to scuttle an ambitious countywide electric trolley bus system -- 
including a line connecting Burbank, Glendale and Pasadena -- has received 
reluctant support from San Gabriel Valley officials who say completion of the 
Blue Line to Pasadena is a greater priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Empathizing with the Metropolitan Transportation Authority board, which faces 
a $126-million deficit, Pasadena Mayor Rick Cole said: "These are tough 
economic times and they require some hard choices. The electric trolley's 
principal advantage is for clean air, but it does not add capacity to the 
(transit) system. So I'm not surprised it got pushed further down the priority 
list." 
</P>
<P>
 By an 8 to 4 vote Dec. 15, the MTA board unexpectedly dumped the $1.2-billion 
project, including planned trolley bus lines in Los Angeles and the San 
Fernando and San Gabriel valleys. The San Gabriel Valley line would have 
replaced two bus lines between Burbank and Pasadena, paralleling the Ventura 
Freeway (134). 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Clark, a member of the Pasadena Transportation Commission, said the 
trolley bus "is a good idea, but this project was badly conceived and 
designed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clark is a former president of the Tri-City Transportation Coalition, made up 
of Burbank, Glendale and Pasadena representatives seeking to improve 
transportation along the east-west corridor of the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 In the voting, the San Gabriel Valley's MTA board member, Duarte Councilman 
John R. Fasana, abstained due to a potential conflict of interest. Fasana is an 
employee of Southern California Edison Co., which had developed proposals for 
the trolley system. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting as an alternate in Fasana's place, Diamond Bar Councilwoman Phyllis 
Papen was one of those voting to kill the trolley. The trolley system, she 
said, does offer great efficiency in combatting air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The trolleys are virtually smog-free, especially when contrasted with 
diesel-burning buses. But "zero-polluting" trolleys don't come cheaply. 
</P>
<P>
 "For every three electric trolley buses you could buy 4 1/2 methanol buses," 
Papen said, explaining her vote. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jeff Johnson, the MTA's director for the trolley project, pointed out that 
electric buses have much longer life spans -- 18 to 21 years -- compared to 
buses that run on diesel, methanol or natural gas and may last 12 to 13 years. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged that in the short run the trolley bus is more expensive. And 
some board members, he said, were put off by the trolley system's potential 
capital costs of between $4.5 million and $5 million per mile just when the MTA 
was facing increasing expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike liquid-fueled mass transit, the trolley system would require building a 
series of fixed power stations as well as installing overhead wiring to propel 
the cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to put all of that in when you're using buses," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the entire system were ever completed, it would add 184 miles of trolley 
routes to the mass-transit system, MTA officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA already has invested $11.6 million in the project, most of it for 
design and engineering work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By canceling the first phase of the trolley system, Johnson said, the MTA 
reaped an immediate savings of $38 million, part of which would have paid for 
an east-west trolley line running across downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 That $38 million, he said, now could possibly be used to help pay for 
extending the Blue Line light rail to Pasadena, which San Gabriel Valley 
officials have said is critical for the region. The Blue Line project is 
estimated to cost $841 million, and transportation planners have been grappling 
with ways to finance it in the face of recessionary times. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, design work for the 13.6-mile extension from Union Station in Los 
Angeles to Pasadena is under way. Thirteen stations are planned, including six 
in Los Angeles and six in Pasadena and one in South Pasadena. A ground-breaking 
ceremony will be scheduled within the next few months for the project, which is 
expected to take four to five years to complete. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan came out against the trolley proposal, and 
this led others to follow suit, according to trolley supporters, including Long 
Beach city officials and business groups now lobbying to reverse the MTA vote. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach and Los Angeles were the first two areas scheduled to have 
trolleys. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach business and community groups had been counting on the trolley 
system, with amenities including antique-style street lamps and bus shelters, 
to help refurbish Anaheim Street there. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA board is not scheduled to reconsider the trolley project. But a vote 
for reversal is always possible, said Johnson of the MTA. "In private business, 
no means no," he said. "In public business, no means 'not now.' "

WESTSIDE DIGEST: WEST HOLLYWOOD; BARS' SMOKING BAN EASED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The West Hollywood City Council eased its new anti-smoking law this week to 
allow smoking in restaurant bars. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4-to-1 decision Monday brings West Hollywood's law, passed last year over 
the objections of restaurant owners, into line with a similar law regulating 
smoking in Los Angeles restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 The original West Hollywood law banned smoking in bars connected to 
restaurants, but exempted other bars. Much of the opposition to the law had 
come from restaurants with attached bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Sal Guarriello, an opponent of the smoking ban, voted against the new 
law, which also no longer allows restaurant owners to apply for variances. The 
council had previously denied a variance sought by restaurant owners who said 
the ban hurts business at their 24-hour restaurant and violates their 
constitutional rights.

WESTSIDE DIGEST: SANTA MONICA; SPANISH IMMERSION PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Edison Elementary School is seeking students to take part in its Two-Way 
Spanish Immersion Program in the fall.  
</P>
<P>
 The program teaches Spanish- and English-speaking children together with the 
goal of making them bilingual and literate in both languages.Instruction is 
mostly in Spanish in kindergarten and first grade, and English instruction is 
increased as the children get older. By fourth grade, instruction is evenly 
split between the two languages; by then, most of the students are fluent in 
both.  
</P>
<P>
 As space permits, applicants who live outside the Santa Monica-Malibu Unified 
School District will be considered for the program. English-speaking children 
with no background in Spanish may enter the program only in kindergarten or 
first grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison School is at 2425 Kansas Ave. in Santa Monica's Pico neighborhood. For 
further information or to make an appointment to visit the school, parents 
should call Principal Ruth Odell or bilingual specialist Diane Brunson at (310) 
828-0335.

ARCHITECTURE: LOOK AT THE CRITIC'S OWN ENVIRONMENT GIVES RISE TO MUSINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON BETSKY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's time to bring it all home. For three years, I have been writing in these 
pages about the buildings and places of the Westside that reveal something 
about who we are, how we live and to what we aspire. This is my last column, so 
I thought I would tell you about where I fit into this architectural survey. 
</P>
<P>
 I live in a 1954 building that reflects all the faith in the future, love of 
the landscape and weakness for snazzy imagery that makes me love the 
architecture of this place. Designed by E. H. Ficket as a "Swiss chalet," it 
has since been painted a hideous orange-pink (salmon , in real estate 
parlance). 
</P>
<P>
 The building is most simply described as an abstraction of the sloping 
alluvial plane that comes down from the Hollywood Hills. What you see from the 
front, above the banana and palm trees, is a roof like a piece of the ground's 
diagonal thrust that has been lifted to make room for people to live under. It 
is also a dynamic form that shoots off from the land and the meeker forms 
people have placed on it. It represents a faith in building.  
</P>
<P>
 Pass under the image and the dark outside foyer (though you need a security 
code these days) and you will emerge into man's answer to the sun and harshness 
of Southern California: the courtyard. Here the public sweep gives way to a 
controlled open space, organized around that most precious commodity in our 
landscape -- water. It is not much of a pool, but the courtyard is larger than 
most, so that you can understand it as a place opened up within the grid of the 
city. The outdoor spaces make and shape this building. Around it, the two-story 
wings of the Hollywood Riviera open up to each other in plain, simply detailed 
walls of glass, jalousies, thin vertical wood strips and stucco. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet that refuge is unstable and cracked, as all man-made things in this 
environment are. To the south, the ground suddenly drops to make way for the 
parking garage. The cars here are not our fetish objects that, while desirable, 
we hide under concrete the way it's done in most apartment buildings. Here, 
they are displayed on each side of this little arroyo. This is not just a 
question of image. The arrangement allows for the maximum amount of parking in 
the lower part of the slope, without having to excavate underneath the pool and 
courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
 Above the parking area, the southern range of apartments stacks up in layers. 
Bridges connect them with the main building. The composition of bridges and 
planes is accentuated by railings that come out at an angle, and by thin posts 
and beams that divide the actual living spaces into an orthogonal composition 
that reveals the relationship between lived space and the structure that 
contains it. Landscape, image, structure -- the basic elements of architecture 
-- come together with a degree of clarity that is to me one of the hallmarks of 
great Los Angeles architecture. 
</P>
<P>
 Our own apartment goes all the way to the peak of the slope. Over the years, 
we have tried to strip it down to allow all the original materials to come out. 
We exposed the metal railing of the staircase and uncovered the wood stud wall 
that separates the kitchen from the living room. Our lives here are like a bit 
of archeology into the architecture of Los Angeles. As I write these last words 
in this three-year survey of the architecture of the Westside, I sit 
encompassed by the grids that cross off a rational parcel for each of us and 
sheltered by the abstract roof that makes us at home here. I look out past palm 
trees at the dingbats and haciendas, office towers and telephone poles that 
make up the confusing network of forms through which you and I must navigate 
every day. Good architecture is a pathfinder in such a landscape, and I wish 
you all a good journey.

BEST BET: GARDENS AS WINDOWS TO HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANNE LOUISE BANNON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gloriana Pionati believes gardens represent life and its cycles. She points to 
the asphyxiated city of Pompeii to prove her point. 
</P>
<P>
 Pionati, an archeologist, author and importer, will be presenting a slide show 
and lecture today at the Huntington Library on gardens in Pompeii, a city that 
was buried alive in 79 A.D. when Mt. Vesuvius erupted. 
</P>
<P>
 Although plants didn't survive when Pompeii was sealed under volcanic ash, 
archeologists were able to determine what plants were grown, from the plaster 
molds they left in the ash. 
</P>
<P>
 And archeologists know what ancient Roman gardens looked like from studying 
wall paintings, garden ornaments that survived the volcanic eruption, and the 
remains of aqueducts, which gave gardeners the freedom and water to plant where 
they wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 Mythology was important in the Roman gardens, Pionati said. Pompeii exported 
wine throughout the ancient world, so the gardens there were often decorated 
with images of Bacchus, the god of wine, and his symbol -- grapes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most interesting to her is "how everything we found 2,000 years ago, we still 
see today," Pionati said. She was referring to water fixtures, such as 
fountains, and to alcoves, which have been around for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 Pionati's lecture starts at 2:30 p.m. in the Friend's Hall at the Library, 
1151 Oxford Road, San Marino. A plant show will follow the talk. Admission is 
free, but a gate donation of $5 for adults, and $3 for children and students is 
suggested.

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: THE REGION; METROLINK RIDERSHIP FIGURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two of Southern California's most popular commuter train stops are in the San 
Gabriel Valley, Metrolink officials say, citing year-end figures on ridership. 
</P>
<P>
 The Riverside line that stops in the City of Industry en route to and from 
downtown Los Angeles recorded the highest average number of boardings each 
week, 2,200. 
</P>
<P>
 And with 1,500 weekly boardings, the Covina station on the San Bernardino line 
tied for second place with Metrolink's Simi Valley stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Each week, Metrolink carries about 33,000 passengers, or the equivalent of two 
freeway lanes of rush-hour traffic, said Larry Walker, head of the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority board. "And we're cleaning the air too. Each week we 
eliminate 2 1/2 tons of air pollutants because motorists are leaving the 
driving to Metrolink."

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY DIGEST: SAN MARINO; FOUNDATION SETS NEW GOAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An education foundation is hoping to raise a record $750,000 by the end of the 
summer semester for the city's school district.  
</P>
<P>
 The San Marino Schools Foundation has set the goal $250,000 higher than the 
amount it raised for 1992-93.The foundation is already on its way to its goal. 
Contributions are up 32% compared to this time last year, foundation officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it was formed 14 years ago, the foundation has raised more than $4 
million for the San Marino Unified School District. Contributions are solicited 
through mailers, speeches, phone banks and events. Parents gave 58% of the 
money last year. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the last time school district foundations were ranked in the state, 
the San Marino foundation raised the second-highest amount of money among 
school districts its size, according to the California Consortium of Education 
Foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation was originally formed in 1979 to provide for special programs 
and facilities. But now that state cutbacks have reduced the district's 
operating budget, the foundation will provide $500,000 for day-to-day 
operations this year.

<P>
 A Rowland Heights construction worker pleaded not guilty Tuesday to charges 
that he molested a 4-year-old girl and photographed the acts. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Lynn Loe, 46, was arraigned in Citrus Municipal Court on 10 felony counts 
of child molestation and five felony counts of possession of child pornography, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Christine Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
 Loe was arrested Friday by Whittier police after photographs of the girl being 
molested were found in a trash dumpster behind a Whittier motel. He is being 
held at Walnut Jail in lieu of $750,000 bail pending a Jan. 13 preliminary 
hearing. If convicted on all counts, he could face up to 29 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Loe was arrested Dec. 20 on suspicion of molesting the same girl and charged 
with one count of performing a lewd act upon a minor. But he was released Dec. 
28 because detectives could not find the photographs of the molestation the 
girl had mentioned. 
</P>
<P>
 Loe's second arrest came after Jack Gray, a Whittier resident who was foraging 
through the dumpster looking for cigarette coupons, came across photographs 
that showed a girl being molested, a bedroom and the hand of a man wearing a 
ring that resembled a ring Loe wears, said Whittier police Detective Tom 
Lamping. 
</P>
<P>
 Police did not immediately realize these could be the missing photographs and 
released a photo of the child's head and shoulders to local television stations 
in hopes of identifying her. 
</P>
<P>
 Calls flooded the police station, three of which identified the girl in the 
photos as the same 4-year-old allegedly molested by Loe. He was arrested again 
Dec. 31 and made admissions about the molestation to a sheriff's deputy the 
following day, Lamping said. 
</P>
<P>
 Loe's attorney, David R. Maldonado, indicated his client was remorseful but 
said he could not comment on the alleged confession. He said Loe may enter a 
plea bargain before his Jan. 13 hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Loe and his girlfriend shared a Rowland Heights apartment unit on Greenport 
Avenue for about six months with the 4-year-old and her mother, but were not 
related to the girl, Weiss said. Loe baby-sat the girl about once a week in 
November and December. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss said the child's mother contacted authorities after her daughter told 
her about certain activities with Loe. Weiss said the 4-year-old told her there 
were photos taken during the molestation but the girl had no idea what Loe had 
done with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a godsend when these photos turned up," Weiss said. "It 
completely corroborates the victim's testimony." 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss alleges that Loe threw the photos away in the dumpster shortly after he 
was released after his first arrest. Loe's girlfriend told authorities the two 
were at the Whittier motel the week after Loe's first arrest and Loe left her 
alone for a few minutes.

EDUCATION: HIGHER EDUCATION PAYS OFF, DATA SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LAINE YARBER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Mary Laine Yarber teaches English 
at Santa Monica High School. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let's go to the numbers again.  
</P>
<P>
 Last week I explored some facts and figures about elementary and secondary 
public schools. Now let's look at some data from the U.S. Department of 
Education, U.S. Department of Commerce and the Census Bureau about high school 
graduates and how they fare in higher education and the job market. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, 71.2% of the nation's high school seniors in public schools actually 
graduated. Minnesota's graduation rate was highest (89.5%); Louisiana's was 
lowest (54.3%). California's was 67.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 More information is available for the class of 1992. For one thing, 1992 
graduates who skipped college in favor of the job market found jobs more easily 
than 1991 graduates: their unemployment rate was 19.4%, compared with 25.3% for 
the class of 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 And here's a warning for would-be dropouts: Only about 60% of dropouts from 
the class of 1992 found jobs. That's an unemployment rate of 39.1% -- double 
the rate for students who stuck around through graduation day. 
</P>
<P>
 Most 1992 high school graduates (63%, the highest ever) entered colleges or 
universities in the fall. Women outnumbered men in that group, 65% to 60%. 
There was considerable racial and ethnic variation: 64% of white high school 
graduates entered college in the fall, but only 49% of the black graduates and 
47% of Latinos did.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One valuable source of information about student attitudes is the national 
survey of college freshmen conducted each fall for the last 27 years by the 
UCLA Graduate School of Education and the American Council on Education. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's survey found that more freshmen were interested in health-related 
careers (15.6% of the class), and fewer interested in business careers (14.3%, 
half the rate of just five years ago). 
</P>
<P>
 Getting rich was still important to most freshmen -- 73% in last year's survey 
-- but that percentage was down slightly for the fifth consecutive year. 
Meanwhile, the goal of "living a meaningful life" was more popular for the 
fifth consecutive year -- now 45.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 One constant of higher education over the years is that it pays. The 1993 
figures once again show a clear tie between education level and income. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 White men who did not complete high school earned an average of $909 per 
month, while those with doctoral degrees averaged $4,679 per month. Between 
those extremes, incomes corresponded with education levels: White men with 
master's degrees averaged $3,248 a month; those with a bachelor's degree made 
$2,552; those who attended college but did not graduate averaged $1,595, and 
high school graduates averaged $1,405. 
</P>
<P>
 Women and ethnic groups earned less at each level, but still saw similar 
proportional differences between education levels. 
</P>
<P>
 The road to riches is expensive, though.  
</P>
<P>
 The 1993-94 college year at a four-year private school -- including tuition, 
required fees, room and board -- is costing an average of $14,176. At a 
four-year public campus, the cost is an average of $6,083 per year for state 
residents, and $9,961 for non-residents. 
</P>
<P>
 At a two-year college, it is an average of $1,679 per year for state 
residents, and $3,938 for non-residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most expensive campuses are Sarah Lawrence College ($25,900 a year), 
Brandeis University ($25,184) and Yale ($25,110).  
</P>
<P>
 The least expensive four-year schools are the U.S. military academies. They're 
free.

RAND CORP.'S PLAN FOR CIVIC CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Santa Monica City Council and RAND Corp.'s Civic Center "Titanic" have 
just collided with the iceberg of public opinion. The excuses and 
rationalization have just begun.It will be interesting to see who survives. 
</P>
<P>
 After 4 1/2 years of repeated warnings, the council's fifth consecutive major 
development defeat calls into question the very legitimacy of the city's 
at-large election process. How can a City Council be so misguided and isolated? 
 
</P>
<P>
 On the 2,500th anniversary of the establishment of democracy as a form of 
government, 8,500 voters of Santa Monica (not such a small minority) took time 
out from their holidays and families to say once again that they want a 
dramatically different development philosophy, and they want a real public 
process, not a charade, not name-calling, not half-truths from an arrogant City 
Council.

BALLOT INITIATIVE ON CIVIC CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A ballot initiative on Santa Monica's Civic Center Specific Plan is a bad 
idea, despite the loud clamor for participatory democracy by Tom Hayden and his 
little band. They unwittingly have shown why it is a bad idea by their 
deceitful statements to get voters to sign their petition. Imagine their 
distortions if the issue actually makes it to a full election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 A letter from Hayden to Santa Monica citizens asserts that the plan will cause 
a "sixfold increase in carbon monoxide over 'safe levels.' " When I challenged 
this claim to one of his stalwarts, who was soliciting petition signatures, the 
answer was "it's in the (Environmental Impact Report." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing could be further from the truth. The environmental impact report shows 
that the year-2000 worst-case concentrations of carbon monoxide are well below 
state and federal standards. But most important, they are barely 
distinguishable from the concentrations expected if the Civic Center project 
does not go forward! 
</P>
<P>
 I am not saying there will be no air quality impacts of the project. What I am 
saying is that the Environmental Impact Report finds these impacts not severe, 
despite Hayden's reckless rhetoric to the contrary. More generally, the process 
of evaluating this and other reckless claims like Hayden's requires a citizen 
to delve into the large documents on the project, and few people have time to 
do that. That is why putting the Civic Center plan on the ballot is a bad idea. 
It just gives a small band of opponents a chance to do great mischief. 
</P>
<P>
 With all its problems, representative democracy has been our way of 
government. The Civic Center plan was developed in a long and democratic 
process. The opponents of the plan, having filed to convince their fellow 
citizens in that process, now want to resort to participatory democracy to 
circumvent the process. In an election campaign, their distorted claims will 
take time to refute, and that gives them a chance to prevail.

DATA IN COLUMN ON EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In citing U.S. Census Bureau statistics on education, Mary Laine Yarber 
(Education column, Dec. 30) no sooner tells us that "The conclusions that can 
be drawn from such data are complicated and largely subjective, so I'll leave 
those to you," than she offers her opinion that "the reason teachers are paid 
less than their equally educated counterparts in other professions is that 
teaching is still a female-dominated occupation." 
</P>
<P>
 First, Yarber mistakenly refers to teachers as professionals -- as if to 
compare them to doctors, lawyers, certified public accountants and similar 
professionals. Teachers are members of trade unions that engage in collective 
bargaining. It is disingenuous for them to claim professional status. 
</P>
<P>
 That teaching is a female-dominated occupation probably does have something to 
do with comparative pay. Yarber implies that this is the product of sex 
discrimination. Of course, she fails to address the issue of a 10-month work 
"year." She also fails to address the fact that women are far more likely to 
drop out of the work force in mid-career or to work limited schedules (be they 
professionals or otherwise), and this factor will show up with a vengeance in 
statistical groups heavily weighted with a female population. In addition, 
teachers often retire earlier than members of the comparison group Yarber 
refers to -- i.e., other professions. In sum, the statistical cause/effect 
relationship Yarber attempts to draw is insupportable. 
</P>
<P>
 Yarber also gives us a batch of numbers about school spending and 
student-teacher ratios with no "conclusions" or "suspicions" as to meaning. But 
she does tell us that California is in the "middle" on state per-student 
spending and ranks near the bottom in terms of teacher-student ratios. 
</P>
<P>
 There are fascinating cause and effect relationships to be gleaned from the 
information she does provide, through. The District of Columbia tops the 
per-student spending list at $9,259 and has the lowest ratio of students per 
teacher at 13.2, while Utah ranks at the bottom of both categories at $2,960 
and 24.9. How about a simple question? Where would you most like your child to 
attend school -- Utah or Washington? Or, guess which schools score higher on 
virtually every comparable test of academic achievement? Finally, in which 
arena does the teachers' union hold ham-fisted control? 
</P>
<P>
 There are conclusions to be drawn here -- but you won't find the "educational 
Establishment" shining light on them. Money is far less an answer to fixing our 
dysfunctional public educational system than wrestling control from the 
dominant educational elites. Also, Utah is often mocked as a Christian 
stronghold (home of the Mormon Church) by the secular elites. But a lot of the 
wacky pandering to the multicultural fad of the day, the idea of 
"outcomes-based" education (i.e. watered-down, pablum-fed curricula and grading 
techniques) have not become firmly entrenched there . . . yet. Maybe Christian 
values . . . oh! Heaven forbid! 
</P>
<P>
 Our public educational system is severely at risk of implosion. It is the 
product of the fad and fantasy ideas (that carry consequences) of the 
educational elites, a unionized work force whose agenda is their own 
entrenchment, and politicians that want to polarize the people of this country 
along racial lines and economic lines in order to assure their own future. Our 
children's future loses its relevancy in the stormy waters churned up by these 
self-interested folks.

APPOINTMENT OF FREEWAY FOE TO HIGHWAY POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What would motivate President Clinton's transportation secretary to appoint a 
professional lobbyist, outspoken on key issues, to assist the federal highway 
administrator? 
</P>
<P>
 What kind of politics is behind the recent appointment of Evelyn Fierro, a 
longtime vocal opponent to the 710 Freeway extension, to a key position within 
the agency that will decide on the fate of the project? 
</P>
<P>
 My immediate reaction was disgust when I first read of the appointment in The 
Times San Gabriel Valley Section. But disgust turned to disbelief after 
thinking it over for a few hours. One would question the political wisdom of 
such an obvious blunder. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress must urge the President to seek a reversal of the appointment or face 
redress by the constituency.

GANG WARFARE LAYS SIEGE TO NEIGHBORHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I commend The Times for bringing attention to the siege taking place in the 
Oakwood/Mar Vista Gardens areas in the Dec. 19 article. But I cannot help but 
compare the coverage of these deaths to the coverage of the Polly Klaas 
tragedy.I did not get any feeling from the article for the personal tragedy of 
the Latino and African American families involved. 
</P>
<P>
 As Executive Director of Mar Vista Family Center, I experience all too 
frequently the pain and anguish of families who have lost young and vital 
children. When I attend a funeral at a local church after a killing, I see 
parents, teachers and police officers. Where were we all before children got 
themselves in this kind of trouble? It is as if the dead youth in the casket is 
shouting out for help from the gross child neglect and abuse. It says to me, 
look how extreme negative behavior has become in order to get attention in our 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Your article covered well the situation but it did not let us know the depth 
of lack of humanity in dealing with the core of the problem. Poverty and 
joblessness open the doors to drugs and guns. It is no news that it translates 
into hard, bitter pre-teens and teen-agers alienated from human values. 
</P>
<P>
 We need mass prevention measures but from our hearts we need to reach out to 
these families in the same proportion as the people of Petaluma reached out to 
the Klaas family.

 A summary of significant Los Angeles City Hall decisions affecting the 
Westside in the last week. CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * SUPER SUNDAY FUND-RAISER: Approved a proposal by Councilwoman Ruth Galanter 
waiving $9,200 in city permit fees to allow the installation of 200 street 
banners announcing the annual Super Sunday fund-raiser by the Jewish Federation 
Council of Greater Los Angeles. The fund-raiser will be held Feb. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 * EROSION PROBLEMS: Approved spending $4,600 to hire a contractor to remove 
debris and prevent further erosion problems near Jewett and Ridpath drives 
north of Sunset Drive. Rainstorms last year washed down a large amount of soil 
from Jewett Drive, an unpaved hillside street, into a back yard on Ridpath. 
</P>
<P>
 * WESTMINISTER PARK: Approved spending $500 in public service money from 
Galanter's district fund to help pay operating expenses for the Westminister 
Park Design Project in Venice. The project is sponsored by the USC School of 
Architecture. 
</P>
<P>
 * BICYCLE LOCKERS: Approved the construction of bicycle lockers on the 
premises of the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority at 
2489 Fairfax Ave. for public use. The city's aim is to encourage bus patrons 
commuting short distances to use bicycles instead of cars. Eighteen lockers 
will cost approximately $1,000 each to purchase and install. 
</P>
<P>
 * GUNS: Councilman Marvin Braude requested that the council support a federal 
proposal to curb gun violence by hiking the license fees for gun dealers and 
increasing the number of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms inspectors, as well as 
the bureau's computer record-keeping capabilities. Under the proposal, the 
annual licensing fee for gun dealers would rise to $600 from $30. HOW THEY 
VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 * VENDING: Approved a proposal legalizing street vending on a trial basis in 
eight special districts in the city. The two-year Pilot Sidewalk Vending 
Program will not be established until the vendors have completed a permit 
procedure. PASSED: 10-0. 
</P>
<P>
 VOTING YES: Braude, John Ferraro, Galanter, Jackie Goldberg, Mark 
Ridley-Thomas and Zev Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
 VOTING NO: Nate Holden. 
</P>
<P>
 * REWARD: Approved a $10,000 reward for information leading to the arrest and 
conviction of the people responsible for about 30 ambush attacks and assaults 
in the past six months against city firefighters. PASSED: 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
 VOTING YES: Braude, Ferraro, Galanter, Goldberg, Holden, Ridley-Thomas and 
Yaroslavsky. LEE HARRIS

COUNCIL APPROVES LIMITS ON AD LEAFLETS IN RESIDENTIAL AREAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An ordinance prohibiting advertisers from distributing leaflets and flyers in 
residential neighborhoods of Beverly Hills without the consent of the residents 
was approved by the City Council without comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, which will receive a second reading Jan. 18, also prohibits 
placement of advertisements on vehicles parked on public streets or public 
property. The law does not apply to newspapers or to materials distributed 
door-to-door by religious or nonprofit organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure was approved at the urging of Ellen Stern Harris, Michael Marcy 
and Betty Harris, who testified last month that advertising material 
accumulating on doors, porches, yards and driveways is a signal to prospective 
burglars that no one is at home. 
</P>
<P>
 No advertisers testified.

RECRUITING / JEFF FELLENZER; DESPITE LOSS, EVERYTHING IS COMING UP ROSES FOR 
UCLA FOOTBALL TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FELLENZER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bolstered by its first Rose Bowl appearance in eight years, UCLA is off to a 
good start in football recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Although players cannot sign letters of intent until Feb. 2, Coach Terry 
Donahue and his staff have unwritten commitments from 10 players. 
</P>
<P>
 USC, rebuilding under Coach John Robinson after several sub-par recruiting 
efforts by former coach Larry Smith and his staff, has concentrated on filling 
specific needs and adding depth to both lines by recruiting community college 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA, which lost to Wisconsin, 21-16, in the Rose Bowl, has been actively 
recruiting out of state, especially the Midwest and Texas. And for good reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a great year in California," says Dick Lascola, who runs the 
Fallbrook, Calif.-based Scouting Evaluation Assn. "The strength of this class 
is the skill kids -- running backs, wide receivers and defensive backs. There 
are virtually no quarterbacks, after Steve Campbell (Norco High) and Steve Buck 
(Alta Loma High), a handful of linemen and no linebackers. Overall, it's pretty 
lean." 
</P>
<P>
 USC has also been recruiting extensively in Texas, and both USC and UCLA could 
be helped by the five-year NCAA probation against the Texas A&M football 
program that was handed down Wednesday. (However, the Aggies are prohibited 
from appearing on television and going to a bowl game only next season.) Texas 
A&M has been the one Southwest Conference school in recent years that has 
consistently recruited well in-state. 
</P>
<P>
 Just this week, USC received a commitment from one of the top players in 
Texas, defensive lineman Cedric Jefferson (6-3, 270) of Ft. Worth, who also 
visited Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins are hoping to sign 20 players, an increase from their previously 
stated goal of 17 or 18. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's 10 commitments: quarterback Steve Buck (6-feet-4, 180) of Alta Loma; 
defensive back-wide receiver Glenn Thompkins (5-9, 165) and offensive lineman 
Rick Austin (6-3, 300) of Rialto Eisenhower; running back-safety Shaun Williams 
(6-2, 185) of Encino Crespi; defensive lineman Danjuan Magee (6-3, 260) of Long 
Beach Poly; tight end-linebacker Mike Grieb (6-4, 220) of San Jose Oak Grove; 
tight end-defensive end Robert Arthur (6-5, 230) of Brownsboro, Tex.; defensive 
back Akil Davis (6-feet, 180) of Mesa, Ariz.; safety DuVal Hicks (6-2, 195) of 
Benicia, Calif., and punter Justin Sogoian (6-4, 195) of Orange Coast College. 
Sogoian, who attended La Quinta High in Westminster, was an all-state selection 
who averaged 42.7 yards a kick last season. He also visited USC. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Newhall Hart linebacker-tight end John McLaughlin (6-4, 220) says 
that UCLA and Notre Dame are his top choices. Florida State, Arizona and 
Nebraska are also among his list of schools. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA and Notre Dame are also the top choices of talented running back Ty Goode 
(6-1, 185) of Southeast High in Lincoln, Neb. Goode rushed for 1,494 yards and 
30 touchdowns last season, but is considered an even better prospect at safety. 
So far, he has resisted pressure to stay home and commit to Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 Latest to sign with the Trojans are defensive end Marcus Bonds (6-6, 235) of 
West Los Angeles, offensive lineman Richard Beatie (6-6, 290) of Glendale and 
defensive back Mario Bradley (6-2, 180) of Cerritos. That group joins two 
earlier community college signees, wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson (6-4, 205) of 
West Los Angeles and linebacker Errick Herrin (6-3, 230) of Mt. San Jacinto. In 
addition, two other community college standouts have made commitments to sign 
with USC next month: offensive lineman Heath Baughman (6-7, 290) of Bakersfield 
and fullback Reggie Brown (6-1, 235) of College of the Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Jefferson, other high school players who have reportedly made 
commitments to the Trojans include standout running back-defensive back Rodney 
Sermons (6-feet, 180) of La Puente Bishop Amat, defensive end George Perry 
(6-6, 235) of San Bernardino and offensive lineman David Caldwell (6-6, 310) of 
Oakland. Next to commit may be defensive back-wide receiver Leon Blunt (5-10, 
180) of San Fernando. Blunt made an unwritten commitment to Notre Dame during a 
recruiting visit last month, but has since reconsidered. He recently visited 
UCLA, but has told friends that he will eventually sign with USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Around the Southland: Van Nuys Montclair Prep running back-defensive back 
Wilbert Smith (5-8, 185), the third-leading rusher in the state last season 
with 2,504 yards, has made an unwritten commitment to attend Illinois. The 
Illini also may be the leader for Rialto Eisenhower running back Marlon Farlow 
(5-11, 175). Notre Dame is among the schools recruiting Farlow . . . Newhall 
Hart wide receiver-defensive back Soren Halladay (6-2, 185) has committed to 
Brigham Young . . . Palos Verdes Peninsula tackle Matt Redman (6-7, 285) raised 
some eyebrows when he committed to Iowa recently after recruiting trips to 
California and Colorado. Redman's parents, grandparents, aunt and uncle 
attended Cal, which was considered the front-runner to sign him. Peninsula's 
other "twin tower," guard John Welbourn (6-6, 275), has visited Cal and 
Nebraska and has trips scheduled this month to UCLA and USC and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw High fullback-linebacker Dennis Fomond (5-11, 210) is scheduled to 
visit Cal this weekend. He also has trips planned to UCLA, Nevada Las Vegas and 
Hawaii. He may also visit USC or Arizona . . . Jefferson High tight 
end-linebacker John Johnson (6-4, 210) has visited Arizona and Kansas and has 
trips planned to Oregon, Washington and Hawaii. UCLA has been recruiting him, 
but he reportedly wants to leave the Los Angeles area . . . One of the better 
offensive line prospects in Southern California, Terry Williams (6-6, 260) of 
Placentia El Dorado, is considering UCLA, USC, Cal, Arizona State and Colorado. 
Williams' brother Steve lettered at UCLA as an offensive lineman in 1981-83 . 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Poly two-way lineman Brandon Whiting (6-3, 260), the son of Poly 
co-coach Thomas Whiting, will also visit Cal this weekend. He has taken a trip 
to Stanford and has one scheduled to Colorado. Two other Poly standouts, 
cornerbacks Kelly Malveaux (5-8, 175) and Lamont Morgan (6-1, 170), are being 
heavily recruited. The speedy Malveaux has visited Cal and Arizona and has 
trips planned to Washington, Colorado and Fresno State. Morgan is considering 
Oregon, Fresno State and Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the Pac-10: Cal has received a commitment from quarterback Trevor 
Thompson (6-4, 190) of Thousand Oaks. Thompson chose the Bears over Fresno 
State, New Mexico and Colorado State. Cal now has at least six commitments: 
tight end-linebacker Tony Gonzalez (6-6, 230) of Huntington Beach (who also 
plans to play basketball); safeties David Burnside (6-2, 175) of Milpitas, 
Calif., Mark Borr (6-1, 190) of Sacramento and Marquis Smith (6-1, 195) of San 
Diego Patrick Henry; fullback Rudy Mattox (6-1, 210) of Pinole Valley and 
community college offensive lineman Derrick Barton (6-8, 295) of San Bernardino 
Valley. In addition, the Bears have re-entered the picture for All-American 
defensive lineman Darrell Russell (6-5, 290) of San Diego St. Augustine, 
perhaps the premier prospect in California. Russell has canceled his trip to 
Miami and will visit Cal instead. He has been to USC and UCLA and also plans to 
visit Notre Dame and Michigan . . . Stanford has received commitments from 
offensive linemen Brian Donahue (6-5, 250) of Albuquerque, N.M., and Geoff 
Wilson (6-6, 255) of Robertsdale, Ala. Donahue chose the Cardinal over USC. 
Wilson was also recruited by Alabama, Auburn, Notre Dame, Georgia Tech and 
Louisiana State. However, Stanford lost standout running back-defensive back 
Tim Dwight (5-8, 155) of Iowa City, Iowa, to the hometown Hawkeyes. Dwight 
visited Stanford last month. 
</P>
<P>
 More Pac-10: Arizona has signed community college tight end Damon Terrell 
(6-4, 235) of El Camino. Terrell, who attended Serra High in Gardena, caught 47 
passes for 588 yards last season. The Wildcats received an unwritten commitment 
from wide receiver Jim Romero (5-9, 170) of Sepulveda L.A. Baptist. Romero, who 
chose Arizona over Washington, caught 86 passes for 1,570 yards and 15 
touchdowns last season . . . Despite the presence of a top-notch freshman 
quarterback, Jake Plummer, Arizona State has received a commitment from highly 
regarded quarterback Steve Campbell (6-7, 220) of Norco. Two of Campbell's 
teammates, offensive linemen Mike Barnes (6-4, 250) and Troy Davis (6-4, 235), 
also committed to the Sun Devils. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, which has been severely hampered by NCAA probation limiting its 
scholarship allotment and official campus recruiting visits, has concentrated 
on in-state players. The Huskies now have eight commitments: offensive linemen 
Ben Kadletz (6-4, 270) of La Canada St. Francis, running back-defensive back Ty 
Fotheringill (5-10, 170) of Kelso, Wash., wide receiver Marvin Kasim (5-9, 170) 
of Seattle, linebacker Chad Wright (6-3, 225) of Fife, Wash., offensive lineman 
Aaron Dalan (6-7, 285) of Sequim, Wash., defensive lineman Josh Smith (6-6, 
225) of Bellingham, Wash., and community college offensive linemen Matt Hicks 
(6-6, 295) and Eugene Seminavaga (6-5, 290) of Cerritos. The Huskies' 
recruiting class would be helped considerably if they can sign standout 
offensive line prospects Tony Coats (6-6, 275) and Benji Olson (6-4, 280), 
teammates from South Kitsap High in Port Orchard, Wash. Olson has already 
visited Washington, and Coats will be in Seattle this weekend. Coats is also 
considering Stanford and Notre Dame.

PROSECUTOR'S PERSISTENCE IN TRIPLE SLAYING CASE PAYS OFF IN CONVICTION; 
CRIMINAL JUSTICE: INFORMATION FROM A KILLING IN LOS ANGELES REVIVED INTEREST IN 
THE SUSPECT, WHO WAS ORIGINALLY RELEASED FOR LACK OF EVIDENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 More than a year after his office had decided there was not enough evidence to 
file charges in a Monterey Park triple slaying, a persistent deputy district 
attorney managed to prosecute anyway -- and obtained a conviction and death 
sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a relief," said the prosecutor, Terrence Terauchi, after a Superior 
Court judge in Compton sentenced Eric Lamont Hinton to death Dec. 10 in the 
drug-related killings. 
</P>
<P>
 After Hinton's initial arrest in the case, he was released due to lack of 
evidence: no weapon and a witness who couldn't identify him as the shooter. But 
more than a year later, Terauchi noticed similarities between another case he 
was preparing and the triple slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Hinton, 24, of Lynwood, was convicted early last year of 
first-degree murder with special circumstances in the May 24, 1988, shooting 
deaths of Tenoa L. Stevenson, 26, of Altadena, Albert Brown, Jr., 24, of 
Pasadena, and Landis Barnes, 20, of Lynwood, a Navy officer who was on leave 
from the Long Beach naval base. 
</P>
<P>
 The three men were killed at the Best Western Monterey Park Inn during what 
police said was a drug deal Hinton had set up in order to rob them. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Cunningham of Pasadena escaped by feigning death. He was a key witness 
for the prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Terauchi's theory of what happened in the motel room, Barnes and 
Cunningham were there as middlemen in the supposed drug transaction. Stevenson 
allegedly was the buyer and brought along his cousin, Brown. Hinton and a man 
he introduced as Steven Hicks supposedly had cocaine to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As Brown and Barnes were about to test what was fake cocaine, Terauchi said, 
they were shot in the head. Then, according to Terauchi, Hicks allegedly shot 
Stevenson; Hinton shot at Cunningham, but missed. Stevenson fell on Cunningham, 
who remained on the floor, feigning death. Hinton and Hicks then allegedly left 
the motel room with the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes later, Stevenson staggered out of the motel onto Atlantic Boulevard 
near Emerson Avenue and bumped into his assailants. They chased Stevenson to a 
used-car lot next to the motel and killed him, the prosecutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man Hinton called Hicks was never arrested because Cunningham could not 
positively place him at the murder scene. Hicks reportedly moved out of state 
shortly afterward. Although Cunningham did place Hinton at the crime scene, he 
could not say whether Hinton had shot at anyone. Hinton maintained that Hicks 
had done all the shooting. The weapons used in the slayings were never 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, we had a dead case," said Officer David Corrigan of the Monterey 
Park Police Department, who at the time was a detective investigating the 
killings. 
</P>
<P>
 The case lay dormant for nearly two years until Corrigan received a call from 
Terauchi sometime in late 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, Hinton was the suspect in the fatal shooting of Dwayne Reed, 
29, of Los Angeles. And Terauchi, who was preparing that murder case against 
Hinton, noticed not only that the suspect had been arrested but released in a 
previous case, but that the bullets in both cases were similar. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that on Aug. 9, 1989, Reed was pumping gas at a station on 
Imperial Highway when Hinton walked up and accused Reed of wanting to kill him. 
Witnesses said Reed, who knew Hinton, denied the allegation. Hinton then 
reportedly said, "I don't trust you" and shot Reed several times in the head.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The bullets that killed Reed have the same characteristics as the bullets in 
the Monterey Park shootings -- same make, same caliber, same direction of twist 
and same numbers of lands and grooves. But we couldn't positively say it was 
the same gun," Corrigan said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time Terauchi's office filed charges against Hinton for the Reed 
shooting, it filed murder charges in the Monterey Park slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's an absolute tenacious bulldog," said Corrigan of the Monterey Park 
prosecutor. "He grabbed onto the case no one wanted to touch and wouldn't let 
go." 
</P>
<P>
 Terauchi tried unsuccessfully to consolidate the cases. When a judge turned 
him down, he tried the Reed case. The jury hung, and Terauchi retried the case. 
On June 5, 1992, Hinton was found guilty of first-degree murder in Reed's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months later, court proceedings began against Hinton in the Monterey 
Park killings. Terauchi tried to introduce evidence from the Reed case to link 
Hinton to both, but his request was denied. 
</P>
<P>
 So with no more legal ammunition than the district attorney's office had had 
from the start, Terauchi went into trial on the Monterey Park case. 
</P>
<P>
 He introduced evidence that the bullets that killed Barnes and Brown came from 
different guns. Based upon the angles at which bullets were found in the bodies 
and in the motel room, Terauchi argued that Hicks could not have been the sole 
gunman. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense argued that Hinton was there to sell drugs on the night of the 
killings but was not involved in the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury found him guilty of all three murders. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were in shock when the jury came back in three days with a guilty verdict 
on all three counts," said Terauchi, who had used his vacation time to clear 
other cases so that he could focus all his attention on the Hinton case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that the trial is over, the real battle begins," said attorney Ronald Le 
Mieux, referring to the appeal process. Le Mieux was hired by Hinton's family 
to represent him during the penalty phase. Hinton was represented by two 
court-appointed attorneys during his trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am sure some of his convictions will be reversed," Le Mieux said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the victims' families consider the convictions and death penalty a closing 
to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to deal with this for five years," said Leon Barnes, Landis' father, 
who attended every day of the trial. "I am glad it's over and done with."

 Although the Palisades boys' basketball team was competing in the Beverly 
Hills tournament last week, 6-foot-5 starting center Greg Thomas missed a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, a drummer for the group Oedipus, skipped a game to do a sound check at 
a West Hollywood nightclub. Sarah Schroeder, a Palisades volleyball player, is 
the group's lead vocalist. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas' decision struck a bad note with Palisades Coach James Paleno. He lost 
his starting job. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas earned his starting job back last week in an 84-73 win over Jefferson 
in the final of the Eagle Rock tournament. Thomas had 16 rebounds Thursday as 
the Dolphins became the first team in 19 years to win consecutive Eagle Rock 
tournament titles. HAWAIIAN DUTY 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Hills finished third last week in the Roosevelt Tournament in 
Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan Sterling, who recovered from the chicken pox to make the trip, had 
career highs of 34 points and 14 rebounds as the Bruins beat host Honolulu 
Roosevelt, 70-52. Sterling made all 16 of his free-throw attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was beautiful," Pacific Hills Coach John Bobich said. "We wore shorts the 
whole time. I think the low (temperature) was 70 degrees. We went to the beach, 
did some snorkeling. We went on all the tours. I hated to come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Hills (10-3) has had a successful holiday season. The Bruins also won 
the El Segundo tournament and finished fifth in the Charter Oak tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we're healthy, we're good and we can play with anybody. If we don't come 
ready to play, we've proved to be a less than average team." 
</P>
<P>
 LOSING PAINS 
</P>
<P>
 St. Monica (2-10), off to its worst start in 10 years, may have lost 5-11 
guard Gabe Pagtama for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Pagtama, who is averaging 15.4 points a game, suffered a hairline fracture of 
his right ankle and will be out a minimum of three weeks. Pagtama first felt a 
pain in the ankle on Thursday during the Mariners' 74-72 loss to Granada Hills 
in the fifth-place game of the Chaminade tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the loss of Pagtama, Coach Leo Klemm remains optimistic about the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 His son, 6-6 center Adrian Klemm, has recovered from a broken left ankle he 
suffered during football season. Kenny Jackson, a 6-4 forward, has returned to 
practice after missing last week because of a shoulder injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still think were going to be a good team when league starts," Klemm said. 
"We'll find some good in all of this." KANGAROO FEVER 
</P>
<P>
 Venice High got a bittersweet taste of basketball's international flavor on 
Monday when it played host to the boys' and girls' teams from Condell Park High 
in Bankstown, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 The visitors were on a three-week tour of four cities. In the San Diego Slam 
'N Surf tournament, the Condell Park boys won the championship and the girls 
finished fourth in their division. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing by 11 points at halftime, the Gondolier boys outscored Condell Park, 
23-8, in the fourth quarter, to win, 64-55. 
</P>
<P>
 "We finally took a game from someone at the end and this was against a very 
good team," Venice Coach Thermon Moore said. "Intensity on defense is what we 
needed. And we showed we're making efforts in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Venice (8-6) was led by junior forward Quintin McCowen, who had 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore hopes the Gondoliers get off to a quicker start when they open Coastal 
Conference play at Manual Arts Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't get down on ourselves. . . for what looked like the eight count," 
he said. "We need to carry it into league." 
</P>
<P>
 In Moore's three previous seasons, Venice has yet to defeat Coastal Conference 
powers Manual Arts, Fairfax or Westchester and has beaten Palisades only once 
in three games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely have equal talent, but we have to practice harder and play with 
intensity for an entire game," Moore said. "If we don't, we'll just be a 
another good team that can't win." 
</P>
<P>
 The Venice girls missed 16 free throws in 21 attempts and lost to Condell 
Park, 56-43. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Haddad had 12 points to lead Condell Park. Senior Carly Furuno and 
junior Yuriko Jung led the Gondoliers with 12 and 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Venice will play host to Los Angeles at 4 p.m. Friday to open Coastal 
Conference play. 
</P>
<P>
 FUTURE PROSPECT 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica junior swingman Damyuhn Campbell has been impressive during the 
holiday tournaments and Santa Monica Coach Ken Sprague cannot wait until next 
week to see Campbell compete against Bay League opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell, who joined the Vikings (3-8) as a sophomore, is the team's leading 
scorer (13) and rebounder (nine) in his second season of organized basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "So far he's doing a good job scoring and playing defense," Sprague said. 
"He's got good three-point range with a nice high release, a lot of quickness 
and good ball-handling." 
</P>
<P>
 Sprague believes Campbell has a particularly bright future because of his size 
and athleticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has all the guard skills, and what impresses me most is that he is 
6-foot-6 and still growing," he said. "I fully expect him to be one of the best 
players in the Southern Section next year. I definitely believe he'll be good 
enough to play Division I." BALANCED ATTACK 
</P>
<P>
 Injuries and illness reduced the Culver City roster to seven players last week 
during the quarterfinals of the 22nd Hart Holiday Classic. After losing to 
Manual Arts, 69-63, the Centaurs suited only six players and lost to Simi 
Valley, 64-55, in the fifth-place game. Culver City (7-6) lost a 10-point 
third-quarter lead against Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fatigue set in," Centaur Coach Jeff Perry said. "With four days straight at 
our pace, we just couldn't keep it up. We were in foul trouble for the whole 
tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior point guard Chris Ellison, who was selected to the Southern Section 
Division VII football team as a defensive back, was named to the all-tournament 
team in basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City begins Ocean League play Friday at Morningside. Perry is confident 
about his team's prospects. Four Centaurs players are averaging more than 10 
points a game: Louie Biaty (14.5), Sanford Richmond (13.9), Damon Williams 
(11.1) and Ellison (10.2),  
</P>
<P>
 "The key to our game is to keep our balanced scoring," he said. "We're not 
concerned about playing away from home since our first 14 games were on the 
road." HOLIDAY WRAPUP 
</P>
<P>
 Westchester beat Inglewood, 66-53, to win the Artesia tournament. Tournament 
most valuable player Danny Walker scored 27 points in the final. The Comets, 
ranked 20th in the nation, also won the Las Vegas Holiday Classic two weeks 
ago. It was the first time Coach Ed Azzam has won two holiday tournaments in a 
season since he became coach in 1979 . . . Beverly Hills won the consolation 
championship of the Katella tournament last week. Center Luke Buffum was named 
to the all-tournament team. He has made all six all-tournament teams in two 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The St. Bernard girls (13-1) beat Gahr, 51-45, to win the Gahr tournament on 
Thursday. It was the Vikings' second tournament victory. They beat Justin 
Siena, 60-33, to win the Santa Barbara tournament Dec. 23. Olympia Scott, The 
Times' 1993 Westside Player of the Year, was voted most valuable player of the 
Gahr tournament. Teammate Marte Alexander was MVP of the Santa Barbara 
tournament. Viking Guard Olanike Farodolu is shooting 50% from three-point 
range (25 of 50) . . . The Crossroads girls (8-3) defeated Crenshaw, 59-32, to 
take third place in the Los Angeles Invitational on Thursday. Sherrise Smith 
(20 points) and Yasmeen Benjamin (14 points) were named to the tournament team. 
"We're executing our offense better and we're reacting to defensive pressure 
better," Coach Larry Wiener said . . . Hamilton (5-4) beat Canoga Park, 55-24, 
to win the Van Nuys tournament on Dec. 22. Hamilton's Natasha Steen, who 
averaged 14.7 points in four games, was named tournament most valuable player. 
Teammates Kelly Peden, Ellen Johnson and Miatta Rice were also named to the 
team. Brentwood (10-4) won the Carpinteria tournament last week, defeating 
Pasadena Poly in the final, 57-52. Gerry Washington, a 6-foot-1 junior guard, 
led the Eagles with 16 points and was named MVP. INJURIES 
</P>
<P>
 Windward (1-6, 0-2 in Liberty League) may play Buckley on Friday in a league 
game without point guard Ryan Groman, who pulled a back muscle in practice last 
week. The senior also has suffered a sprained ankle, a pull hamstring and a 
scratched cornea, but missed only one game. He is averaging 13 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may not have earned my pay as a coach as yet, but I definitely have as a 
trainer," Windward Coach Ken Asher said. MISCELLANY 
</P>
<P>
 Owen Hahn resigned after four seasons as Santa Monica College football coach. 
He was 25-16-1 at Santa Monica and 34-26-1 at the community college level. Hahn 
coached at West L.A. from 1979-80. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been doing this for 31 years and basically I ran out of gas," said Hahn, 
who began coaching at the high school level in 1968. His overall record is 
74-37-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica cannot offer a teaching position to go with the coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
 Corsair assistant Robert Taylor, a 10-year assistant, is expected to be named 
coach on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills catcher Jeremy Booth was chosen to the 1994 Mizuno USA preseason 
high school All-American team, selected by Collegiate Baseball. Booth, The 
Times' 1993 Westside Player of the Year, batted .562 with five home runs and 45 
runs batted in last season. He had a .991 fielding average and threw out 10 
baserunners. 
</P>
<P>
 In girls' volleyball, Windward middle-blocker and setter Jessica Papell, a 
5-foot-6 freshman, was selected to the Southern Section Division VI first team. 
Papell, who is also a left-handed pitcher and first baseman on the softball 
team, led the Wildcats in kills. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's an outstanding hitter with a very good wrist snap and has made herself 
into a top player," Coach Gail Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats (14-6), who finished second in the Liberty League and playoff 
quarterfinalists, will return 14 of 15 players next year, including Papell.

TANTALIZING TASTES OF PAST MONTHS MAKE MEMORIES TO SAVOR; BACK FOR SECONDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I won't say I haven't eaten well during the past several months, but recent 
dining trends in Orange County and nationally have moved kitchens away from 
smashing individual effort. In a sluggish economy, the money is in volume, 
which explains why Wolfgang Puck is looking to his pizza cafe concept and why 
top chefs everywhere are concentrating on spiffy mall locations and franchise 
consulting jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 This may also explain why my latest "best dishes" list is perhaps less 
compelling than past ones, seen annually at this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Italian food is everywhere at the moment, as are good concept restaurants such 
as La Salsa, Benita's Frites and Sfuzzi, places where I did some of my most 
enjoyable eating in recent months. And thank heaven for those small ethnic 
cafes, which provide welcome relief to the sameness in great numbers of our 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 So once again, with no particular rhyme, reason or order, a list of favorite 
foods: 
</P>
<P>
 Hot white chocolate and raspberry souffle: With all the good things executive 
chef John Sharpe prepares at his eclectic, exuberant Topaz Cafe, it seems a bit 
odd to single out a dessert as his crowning achievement. Thing is, though, this 
is the one dish -- a puffy, elegant cloud of rich dessert flavors -- that I 
keep coming back to in my fantasies. 
</P>
<P>
 Eaten at lunch, it's enough to make you swoon for the rest of the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Topaz Cafe, 2002 N. Main St., Santa Ana. (714) 835-2002. Hot white chocolate 
and raspberry souffle, $5.95.  
</P>
<P>
 Pizza quattro formaggi: Steven Singer is another corporate genius; indeed, the 
20 Sfuzzi locations nationwide all abound with his upscale Italian creations. 
</P>
<P>
 In Costa Mesa, head chef Susan Kaitz puts out wonderful pizzas, all of which 
are served on porous earthenware platters that keep the thin crusts appealingly 
crisp. Her four-cheese pizza ( quattro formaggi ) isn't available every day, 
but when it is on special, it is a knockout, literally drooling thin rivulets 
of pungent imported cheeses. 
</P>
<P>
 Sfuzzi, Triangle Square Mall, 1870 Harbor Blvd., Costa Mesa. (714) 548-9500. 
Pizza quattro formaggi, $8.95.  
</P>
<P>
 Champon: Ramen is the garlicky, carbo-happy staple of the average Japanese 
businessman's diet -- long, thin noodles slurped up from huge bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 Champon is the characteristic dish of Nagasaki: a Portuguese inspired bowlful 
of salted Ramen noodles with shrimp, pork, squid, vegetables and squiggly fish 
cakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Ebisu Ramen's version tastes exactly like one you would eat in Nagasaki. The 
only difference is the price; here, about half what you'd pay in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Ebisu Ramen, 18924-A Brookhurst St., Fountain Valley. (714) 964-5993. Champon, 
$5.75.  
</P>
<P>
 Pork chops glazed with balsamic vinegar: Laguna's elegant and pricey Sorrento 
Grille has built a reputation on simple, sumptuous Italian dishes made from 
high-quality ingredients. The restaurant's thick pork chops glazed with a light 
coating of balsamic vinegar have a faintly sweet, wistfully herbal flavor, and 
the porcini-infused mashed potatoes they sit on are sheer heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 The only thing this dish will lighten, though, is your wallet. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorrento Grille, 370 Gleneyre St., Laguna Beach. (714) 494-8686. Pork chops 
glazed with balsamic vinegar, $21.95.  
</P>
<P>
 Jujeh shekemi: You won't find jujeh shekemi on the menu at Bahar, a Corona del 
Mar Persian restaurant, but if you're lucky, you'll persuade co-manager Sohila 
Rastegar to venture into the kitchen and prepare some for you. (It's been known 
to happen.) 
</P>
<P>
 This festive dish is basically chicken stuffed with walnuts, raisins and 
barberries, a specialty from northern Iran near the Caspian Sea. It's the one 
chicken dish I know of that combines meat, fruit and nuts with consummate 
skill.  
</P>
<P>
 Bahar, 2640 E. Coast Highway, Corona del Mar. (714) 640-1515. Jujeh shekemi, 
$12.95.  
</P>
<P>
 Chicharrones en chile rojo: Everything, from the thick, pulpy juices to the 
fragrant, fluffy rice, is terrific at Ivan Calderon's Taco Mesa, a Costa Mesa 
food stand where Mexican cuisine scales new heights here in Orange County. But 
the homey chicharrones en chile rojo, a dish from dieter's hell, shows 
Calderon's true colors. 
</P>
<P>
 It's stewed bits of pork skin in a smoky red sauce, about as far from Mexican 
hamburger stand food as you can get. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is delicious. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Mesa, 647 W. 19th St., Costa Mesa. (714) 642-0629. Chicharrones en chile 
rojo, $4.95.  
</P>
<P>
 Kitfo: Michael Belay broke new ground last spring when he opened Ras Dashen, 
the county's first Ethiopian restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethiopian cuisine is one of the cooking world's true oddities: highly spiced 
dishes eaten on injera, a spongy millet bread. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitfo is similar to steak tartare : buttery, hand-chopped beef with spices 
that render it the color of dark stained wood. But be warned, the dish is 
fairly hot, from a mixture of chilies, rue seed, caraway, cardamom and ginger, 
calling cards of the east African kitchen. 
</P>
<P>
 Ras Dashen, 12549 Harbor Blvd., Garden Grove. (714) 638-4260. Kitfo, $5.99.  
</P>
<P>
 Oak-grilled artichoke: Seal Beach isn't a restaurant town, but a winemaker 
named Walt Babcock would like you to think of it as one. 
</P>
<P>
 His peerless seafood house, Walt's Wharf, is easily the best restaurant here, 
though, oddly, the best dish the restaurant serves isn't seafood. It is, 
rather, a sensational oak-grilled artichoke served simply with a 
Worcestershire-mayonnaise dip, great eating when combined with the restaurant's 
good sourdough bread and a glass of (what else?) Babcock Chardonnay. 
</P>
<P>
 Walt's Wharf, 201 Main St., Seal Beach. (310) 598-4433. Oak-grilled artichoke, 
$5.50.  
</P>
<P>
 Granita di espresso: Pino Luongo is one of New York City's most celebrated 
restaurateurs, proprietor of such spots as Le Madri and Coco Pazzo, two of that 
city's best known Italian restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky for us, he doesn't just love New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Luongo's wonderful Piccola Cucina may be Orange County's best Italian 
restaurant. The shaved ice that Italians call granita is wonderfully 
refreshing, and Piccola Cucina's is fabulous, a grainy, intense sorbet layered 
with thick gobs of panna , unsweetened whipped cream. 
</P>
<P>
 Piccola Cucina, 3333 Bristol St., No. 3001, Costa Mesa. (714) 556-5844. 
Granita di espresso, $4.50.  
</P>
<P>
 Banh beo Tay Thuong: The remarkable Tran family is responsible for Hue 
Rendez-Vous, one of Little Saigon's few restaurants serving the exotic fare of 
central Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Ban beo are tiny, chewy, rice flour crepes as prepared in a village named Tay 
Thuong. You get a dozen or so -- diaphanous things topped with pork cracklings 
and shrimp paste -- served on tiny saucers. The crepes are so thin they are 
nearly invisible, but the dish is one you will never forget. 
</P>
<P>
 Hue Rendez-Vous, 15562 Brookhurst St., Westminster. (714) 775-7192. Banh beo 
Tay Thuong, $3.25.  
</P>
<P>
 Roast chicken: Who doesn't love good roast chicken, crisp skin and soft meat 
falling off the bone when you give it a good push? 
</P>
<P>
 La Salsa, a chain of taquerias that has recently opened a sit-down restaurant 
in Triangle Square, has the roasters positioned right near the door, so you can 
smell the birds cooking as you walk by. 
</P>
<P>
 This is great chicken that drips spices and oozes flavor. It's certainly the 
best chicken I've had in many months. 
</P>
<P>
 La Salsa, Triangle Square, 1807 Harbor Blvd., Costa Mesa. (714) 646-0397. 
Roast chicken, $6.95 (half), $4.95 (quarter).  
</P>
<P>
 Torshi: Persian food, as it is presented in the restaurants around here, is 
mostly a series of kabobs and rice. Alborz in Laguna Hills goes the competition 
one better by serving stews and casseroles that nearly rival good home cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the remarkable torshi , tart pickled vegetables, that really make an 
impression here. Alborz' version, which cuts the richness of the entrees, 
typically includes carrots, onions and cauliflower. For the intrepid, sometimes 
there is also pickled garlic, individual cloves that penetrate to the very 
heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Alborz, 25381 Alicia Parkway, Laguna Hills. (714) 472-0064. Torshi, $3.  
</P>
<P>
 Clam fritters: Who woulda thunk it? Top quality New England-style cooking in 
La Habra. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Golden, that's who. 
</P>
<P>
 This Cape Cod-born chef dazzles diners with Orange County's best clam chowder, 
great pot roast and even Indian pudding, a molasses and cornmeal dessert. 
</P>
<P>
 Clam fritters are simple, crunchy, silver dollar-size griddle cakes made from 
an eggy batter and permeated with fresh chopped clams. You eat them with a 
creamy homemade tartar sauce that puts commercial sauces to shame. 
</P>
<P>
 Bay Colony, 115 N. Harbor Blvd., La Habra. (714) 525-8288. Clam fritters, 
$5.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Club sandwich: Bob Burns is a bastion of California/Continental-style cooking, 
the sort of dark, clubby place where you still encounter Cobb salad, sauteed 
calf's liver and Black Angus beef.  
</P>
<P>
 My favorite thing to eat here is the club sandwich, a symphony of terrific, 
meaty applewood-smoked bacon, Bibb lettuce, grilled chicken and sliced avocado, 
all punctuated in grand style by a delicate tarragon mayonnaise. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply stated, it is the perfect lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Burns, 881 Newport Center Drive, Newport Beach. (714) 644-2030. Club 
sandwich, $7.95.  
</P>
<P>
 Lasagnette all'Emiliana: The oddly situated Da Vinci (in Santa Ana's Bluebird 
Inn) is surely one of the county's most accomplished and surprising Italian 
restaurants. Owner Layla Boyajian had the daring to import two young Italian 
chefs, Roberto Borsani from Bergamo and Alberto Gianti from Milan, and her 
passion has paid dividends. 
</P>
<P>
 This rich lasagna consists of nine layers of homemade noodles made with lots 
of whole egg, a toothsome ragu of veal and a thick Bechamel sauce. Don't even 
think about it if you want a light meal. 
</P>
<P>
 Da Vinci, 2222 E. 1st. St., Santa Ana. (714) 285-1130. Lasagnette 
all'Emiliana, $9.75.  
</P>
<P>
 Banh mi and bo kho: Don't be fooled by the exotic names; these two items are 
really nothing more than beef stew and chewy fresh rolls, translated into 
Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
 Song Long is a wonderful little crossover cafe combining the foods of Vietnam 
and France; it's a place where you can eat shrimp paste or orange duck. 
</P>
<P>
 The beef stew is loaded with chunks of soft beef and steamed potato; the rolls 
are baked fresh daily in the cafe, and the price is a steal. 
</P>
<P>
 Song Long, 9361 Bolsa Ave., Westminster. (714) 775-3724. Banh mi and bo kho, 
$4.25.  
</P>
<P>
 Confetti oysters: Normally, one doesn't expect to find good food at a jazz 
club, but talented Steve Palmer breaks all the rules at Randell's in Hutton 
Center, Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer cooks up lots of Cajun- and California-style fare, but these oysters 
are the one dish I keep coming back to. They are coated in cornmeal and fried 
crisp, then put back into their shells with a colorful chipotle chili remoulade 
and sprinkled with diced red and yellow peppers. 
</P>
<P>
 Randell's, Three Hutton Center Drive, Santa Ana. (714) 556-7700. Confetti 
oysters, $9.95.  
</P>
<P>
 Paella: Pepe Santamarina is from northern Spain, but his restaurant, 
Mascarpone, specializes in Italian cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, call 24 hours in advance and Santamarina will prepare you his 
paella , the saffron-flavored rice casserole that is Spain's national dish. 
</P>
<P>
 This is simply great eating, a huge ceramic crock brimming with shellfish, 
calamari, pork riblets, chorizo, chicken and, of course, the rice. Santamarina 
even has the perfect wine -- Spain's Arborino -- to serve as an accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
 Mascarpone, 1448 E. Katella Ave., Orange. (714) 633-0101. Paella, call for 
price.  
</P>
<P>
 Peking duck: Many of our fancier Chinese restaurants churn out versions of 
this classic Chinese dish, but none do it better than China Best, a modest, 
mom-and-pop-style Cypress cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 A masterpiece of lacquered skin, lean meat and soft bones, the dish needs to 
be ordered two days in advance. Chef Hsu Mu-Yen carves the bird and serves it 
inside crepes with scallions and a pungent plum sauce. At under $20, it is 
almost a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
 China Best, 4758 Lincoln Ave., Cypress. (714) 827-8170. Peking duck, $19.95.  
</P>
<P>
 Shelton Farm turkey: Leave it to Hans Prager, proprietor of Newport Beach's 
Ritz and Yankee Tavern, to fancy up an American classic to the point that it is 
actually improved upon. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelton Farm turkey is moist and soft, with a flavor somewhere between wild 
and frozen, as good as you will find in a restaurant. Here, the sliced meat 
comes on a delicious but light pecan stuffing with fine giblet gravy. 
</P>
<P>
 It's always Thanksgiving in Newport, we guess. 
</P>
<P>
 Yankee Tavern, 333 Bayside Drive, Newport Beach. (714) 675-5333. Shelton Farm 
turkey, $11.95.  
</P>
<P>
 Kubbeh nayya: Kubbeh nayya may be, along with kitfo, reigning monarch of the 
world's raw meat dishes. A man named Hassan Hassan serves it up at his Lebanese 
restaurant in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The dish is finely ground lamb infused with sweet basil, hot cayenne, cumin 
seed and cinnamon, all thickened with bulgur wheat. The best way to eat it is 
on slices of toasted pita bread, with a glass of robust red wine. 
</P>
<P>
 Hassan's, 3325 Newport Blvd., Newport Beach. (714) 675-4668. Kubbeh nayya, 
$14.  
</P>
<P>
 Hungarian goulash soup: Gulyas, or goulash in English, is really a spicy 
Hungarian soup made a burnished red through an overwhelming dose of paprika. 
Arnie's Manhattan, a Jewish-style deli in Newport Beach, makes the best version 
I know of, thick, ruddy and chock full of beef and potato. 
</P>
<P>
 Eat a bowlful alongside slices of the restaurant's seeded rye bread and 
half-sour pickles. It's deli heaven at bargain basement prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnie's Manhattan, 1660-B Dove St., Newport Beach. (714) 252-8646. Hungarian 
goulash soup, $2 (cup), $3.95 (bowl).  
</P>
<P>
 Three amigo beans: All of the tomato-less Santa Maria-style barbecue at the 
new Johnny D's in Huntington Beach is terrific -- smoky, complex meats that are 
at once spicy and mysterious. But it is one of the accompaniments, three amigo 
beans, that really stands out. 
</P>
<P>
 The dish is composed of white, kidney and butter beans, slow cooked with 
vinegar, ginger, coriander and possibly curry powder. 
</P>
<P>
 They stay with you, believe me. 
</P>
<P>
 Johhny D's Open Pit Grill, 7320 Center Ave., Huntington Beach. (714) 373- 
4372. Three amigo beans, $2.25 (8 oz.), $3.95 (16 oz.).  
</P>
<P>
 Belgian fries: Belgians are the real purveyors of the french fry, a snack 
eaten on every street corner in the country. The fabulous Benita's Frites 
serves the Southland's best fries in paper cones, cholesterol-free potatoes 
blanched in low-temp oil and then fried to a crackling crisp. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrific sauces, however, are what make this concept take off. Choose from 
more than 20 international toppings: sambala chili, radicchio lemon garlic 
mayo, peanut curry satay and more. 
</P>
<P>
 Benita's Frites, 245 Pine Ave., Long Beach. (310) 458-2889. Fries, $1.95, 
$2.95, $3.95.  
</P>
<P>
 Muhammara: Tosh's Mediterranean is the only restaurant in Orange County to 
offer authentic Turkish dishes, great kabobs, borek (flaky stuffed pastries) 
and honey-rich desserts. 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammara is one of the appetizers here, and it is a real oddity: crushed 
walnuts mixed with bread crumbs, cayenne pepper and olive oil. It looks and 
feels like mortar, but it is a great way to start an exotic meal. 
</P>
<P>
 Tosh's Mediterranean, 16871 Beach Blvd., Huntington Beach. (714) 842-3315. 
Muhammara, $3.25.

CAN'T CRACK THE MTV ROTATION

 Dramarama's records keep getting better and better, while its luck keeps 
getting worse and worse. 
</P>
<P>
 As a songwriting and recording unit, the Southern California rock band has 
been doing all anyone can ask. 
</P>
<P>
 Dramarama has put out albums in each odd-numbered year since 1985. All five 
have had their share of memorable melodies, and the band's sound has gotten 
progressively tougher, culminating in a powerful 1993 release, "Hi-Fi Sci-Fi." 
John Easdale, the singer and main songwriter, dwells primarily on themes of 
fear, loathing and desperation, but typically enlivens his material with turns 
of wordplay and wit. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics have downgraded the band for being tied too closely to the sound 
of such influences as the New York Dolls, David Bowie, Mott the Hoople and the 
Stooges. There's no doubt that Dramarama's members pay close heed to their 
record collection -- something perhaps inevitable for a band that got its start 
in the basement of a New Jersey record shop run by a couple of the members. 
</P>
<P>
 But, even while it remains the rock band most likely to quote a classic 
Rolling Stones guitar solo verbatim, Dramarama uses its borrowings knowingly 
and intelligently. It may not have an original sound, but originality is an 
elusive grail in a genre as basic as guitar-oriented rock. The songs achieve 
something equally important: a sense that the band is looking at the world in a 
way that is personal, imaginative and very much its own. 
</P>
<P>
 But a distinctive songwriting style is no guarantee of heavy rotation on MTV. 
</P>
<P>
 Dramarama got an early career boost when "Anything, Anything (I'll Give You)," 
a song from its self-financed debut album, became a staple on KROQ. Thus 
encouraged, Dramarama relocated from Wayne, N.J., to Los Angeles in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 By mid-1988, the band had broken up after failing to land a record deal. But 
the members thought better of it, regrouped, and landed a deal with an 
independent label, Chameleon. In 1989, the album "Stuck in Wonderamaland" 
finally won Dramarama a national cult following to go with its staunch Southern 
California backing. "Vinyl" (1991) was a strong bid for a commercial 
breakthrough; when that bid failed, band members groused openly about 
Chameleon's promotional efforts. "Hi-Fi Sci-Fi" was an even stronger bid (with 
new drummer Clem Burke, formerly of Blondie, joining the longstanding lineup of 
Easdale, bassist Chris Carter and guitarists Peter Wood and Mark (Mr. E) 
Englert). Again, though, the hoped-for commercial break didn't come. Now, 
however, there is no record company to complain about, Chameleon having gone 
out of business a few months after the album's release. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves Dramarama to face another test of its already much-tested 
perseverance. Right now it can enjoy the comforts of home: The band is winding 
up a series of Southern California concerts with a double-header Saturday night 
at the Coach House. Dramarama will play "unplugged" during an early show, then 
crank up the volume for the night owls. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the future, maybe the group should try putting out an album in an 
even-numbered year. History suggests that the odds are not in this band's 
favor.

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK: JUNIOR BROWN, "GUIT WITH IT"; CURB  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This singer-songwriter-guitarist from Austin is two-thirds of a real find. 
With a booming bass-baritone that recalls the likes of Johnny Cash and 
Tennessee Ernie Ford and an extraordinary facility on the "guit-steel," his own 
double-necked hybrid of an electric guitar and a lap steel, Brown creates an 
instantly definable presence on his major-label debut album. 
</P>
<P>
 In the best of its dozen songs -- 10 of which Brown wrote -- he sings with the 
authority of country music's founding fathers. The opening track is one of 
those highlights; it sounds like the best song Hank Thompson never wrote. 
"Doin' What Comes Easy to a Fool" sounds like a lost classic from the '40s 
time-warped to the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Its chorus is as cleverly crafted as it is emotionally hard-hitting: "I would 
rather be lonesome / Than spend another day with you / Leavin' you is easy / 
'Cause lovin' you was cruel / So I'm doin' what comes easy to a fool." 
</P>
<P>
 In other songs, however, Brown's writing lacks the consistency he exhibits in 
vocals so woody that owls could nest in them, and instrumental virtuosity so 
imposing that it's hard to believe it's just one man at work. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, when everything comes together as it does more often than not, Brown 
establishes the very real prospect that he may be may be just an album or two 
away from being a Triple Crown winner. RANDY LEWIS

CLASSIC OF THE WEEK: THE MINUTEMEN, "DOUBLE NICKELS ON THE DIME" (1984); SST  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If punk rock principally was about breaking the rules, the Minutemen may have 
been its most impressive practitioners: The trio from San Pedro immediately 
established itself as a band that was going to lead, not follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Largely eschewing the primitive guitar fury that fueled Southern California's 
incendiary hard-core punk movement, the Minutemen opted instead for a sound 
that freely and deftly combined rock, funk, jazz and experimental textures. 
</P>
<P>
 "Double Nickels on the Dime" may be their definitive recorded statement. With 
a whopping 43 tracks that total a mere 74 minutes (they weren't called the 
Minutemen for nothing), the disc reflects the extensive scope of the band's 
ambition and originality. Such tracks as "It's Expected I'm Gone" spotlight the 
'Men's predilection for free-form bass-drum-guitar mini-jams. "This Ain't No 
Picnic" exemplifies their gift for whipping up the occasional straightforward 
rocker. 
</P>
<P>
 The rousing "Picnic" is uplifted by a booming chorus shouted out by bassist 
Mike Watt and guitarist D. Boon, whose death in a van accident in 1985 cut 
short the group's existence (though Watt and Minutemen drummer George Hurley 
continue on as Firehose). 
</P>
<P>
 Wonderful weirdness also abounds on this album, which includes a melody 
purging cover of Steely Dan's "Dr. Wu," an out-of-left-field acoustic guitar 
instrumental and an offbeat song featuring a tribal rhythm and chanted 
nonsense. JON MATSUMOTO

WANNA DANCE?: FROM THE '50S TO THE '70S, NOSTALGIA LASTS LONGER AT MUSIC CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 "Golden oldies" might mean bobby socks, doo-wop music, tail fins and a slim 
King to a generation of baby boomers, but as far as nightclubs are concerned, 
that category is redefined as each year passes.  
</P>
<P>
 When Righteous Brother Bill Medley opened the Hop a decade ago in Fountain 
Valley, it was sounds of the '50s and early '60s that rocked the house, to the 
delight of the middle-aged, suburban denizens who packed the place. But today's 
thirtysomething club-goers came of age during Vietnam and "Disco Duck." So the 
Hop became Music City in late 1992 to reflect the musical and generational 
shift, adding another decade of tunes to its playlist. 
</P>
<P>
 In the initial months of the change the club also dabbled in country -- 
apparently to cash in on the trend -- but after three months, Music City turned 
to classic rock 'n' roll and pop. Sounds from the '60s and '70s groove the 
crowd almost exclusively now, although occasionally a song will still inspire 
the crowd to break into a country-style line dance, and some '50s acts 
periodically resurface for live concerts.  
</P>
<P>
 Even on the several large screens throughout, videos rerun programs such as 
"Hullabaloo" and '60s episodes of "American Bandstand," starring a variety of 
rock stars, celebs and those ever-peppy dance choruses in a range of mod to 
hippy modes. It's a chance to watch the likes of the late Michael Landon 
singing some finger-snapping ditty while a multiethnic troupe of dancers in 
cheerleading outfits and go-go boots bounces in the background. Tres 
entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Music City's walls are covered with posters, photographs and gold records of 
everyone from the Beatles to Billy Joel. Even though Medley sold his interest 
in the club a couple of years ago to a group of investors, his presence is 
still evident: There's Righteous Bros. memorabilia at every turn, and his name 
still graces matchbook covers and flyers advertising Bill Medley's Music City. 
(Footnote: This club is no longer affiliated with the Hop in Lakewood, which 
Medley also previously owned.) 
</P>
<P>
 Other nostalgia items include a cheesy faux marquee for the film "Dirty 
Dancing" and an abundance of photos of that movie's star, Patrick Swayze. 
Medley, who (along with Jennifer Warnes) sang the hit theme from that flick, is 
still likely to work the song into the 20 or so annual appearances he makes on 
the Music City stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Other entertainers from yesteryear also perform live at the club, including 
Medley's pianist Lee Farrell, who will tickle the ivories in a concert Jan. 26 
(tickets: $5). On Jan. 15, the Drifters featuring Bobby Hendricks will remind 
patrons of their musical roots with hits such as "Under the Boardwalk" and 
"There Goes My Baby" (tickets: $7.50). 
</P>
<P>
 As of this month, Saturday night concerts will no longer be a seated-only 
affair: The dance floor will be open for those who can't sit still. 
</P>
<P>
 Weekly, cover bands with such original names as the Casualties and Double 
Parked interpret their favorite oldies, alternating nights with the recorded 
versions rotated by deejay Kevin 'R', who annoyingly tries to imitate those 
loudmouths on oldies stations.  
</P>
<P>
 Signs of rock's early roots still exist here, and not only with concerts by 
groups like the Drifters. The entrance resembles the front of a Wurlitzer -- 
one that's 15 feet tall, so patrons get the sense of walking into a giant juke 
box. On the cluttered walls are photos of Chuck Berry, Fats Domino and other 
rock legends. A faux hotel facade, like those found on the sets of high school 
musicals, flashes "vacancy" at the Heartbreak Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 At the entrance to the kitchen, a diner sign glows, but the "diner" is the 
club, which seats about 320 of its 380 occupancy limit. The cuisine is 
decidedly Americana, with hot dogs and prime rib included on a menu featuring 
nothing more than $6.95. Appetizers, starting at $2.95, include taquitos, 
mushrooms and shrimp cocktail. Nightly dinner specials will start this month, 
such as swordfish for $4.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinner starts at 7 p.m. when the club is open (it's closed Sunday through 
Tuesday, except for special events), and ends at 11 p.m. on Wednesday and 
Thursday and midnight on Friday and Saturday. Thursdays and Fridays feature 
complimentary buffets from 5 to 7 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 Drink deals like $2 "you-call-it" specials and shooters vary nightly. There 
are also wells for $3, domestic and imported beers ($2.75 to $3.50) and glasses 
of wine ($2.75 to $3.75). 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In other club news, Tia Carrere -- who reprises her role as Wayne's rock 
singer girlfriend in the current "Wayne's World 2" -- will perform tracks from 
her recently released debut album, "Dream" (Warner Bros./Reprise), at Roxbury 
South in Santa Ana Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The model-turned-actress-turned-singer, besides being on the cover of this 
month's "Mirabella" as one of the magazine's seven women to watch for '94, is 
the wife of Roxbury owner Elie Samaha.  
</P>

 Carrere will hit the stage around 11:30 p.m. Tickets are $10.

'CHINESE COMEDY' STANDS UP FOR TRADITIONAL ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, Benjamin Epstein is a free-lance writer who frequently 
contributes to The Times Orange County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Chinese Comedy in the Late 20th Century," Friday and Saturday at the Irvine 
Barclay Theatre, not only recounts the story of Chinese comedy in the late 20th 
Century, but having breathed new life into what was otherwise a relic from 
another era, it is the story of Chinese comedy in the late 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the Communists took over China in 1949 and the Nationalist government 
moved to Taiwan, xiangsheng -- Chinese stand-up comedy -- just died, 
disappeared," Stan Lai explained in a phone interview from his home in Taiwan. 
"Some xiangsheng actors came to Taiwan, but the masters stayed on the mainland. 
In the '70s, the most famous duo broke up, and that was it, the end of the 
whole tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly. Back in Taiwan after graduating from UC Berkeley with a Ph.D. in 
dramatic art, Lai founded Performance Workshop, and in 1985, focusing on 
xiangsheng and using improvisational techniques, the group produced its first 
artistic and commercial success. 
</P>
<P>
 The play, "Chinese Comedy in the Late 20th Century," Lai said, "pays tribute 
to an art form that for us has died. But we use that art form to pay the 
tribute. So while my concept was 'xiangsheng is gone, and if its time has come, 
it should go,' since the play became so popular the form has been revived. Now 
it's come back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington, D.C.-born Lai, 37, has been based in Taiwan since age 12. 
Performance Workshop is considered Taiwan's leading contemporary theater group, 
and its first feature film, "The Peach Blossom Land" (1992), recently won best 
film and best director awards at the Singapore International Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's Irvine performances are sponsored by Bravi 9 Inc., a nonprofit 
organization formed to respond to growing local demand for multicultural 
experiences. In 1992, Bravi 9 purchased and installed supertitle equipment in 
the Barclay's Cheng Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Lai is "dead set" against supertitles for his work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say no, no, no, that we've been to California twice, and there's 
enough demand from the Mandarin-speaking audience!" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of my work is very verbal. If we do supertitles, you're going to be 
looking at a waterfall, because of the speed (at which the dialogue unfolds). 
And a lot of things just wouldn't translate. Humor is cultural, and often very 
local."  
</P>
<P>
 He also pointed out the fundamental differences between Chinese and Western 
stand-up humor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like vaudeville in the West, there is one straight man and one comic," Lai 
said. "But the basic formula for constructing a punch line in xiangsheng is 
'three rolls and one unraveling.' The great xiangsheng routines are structured 
with a rhythm repeated three times. You slowly wrap the bundle, you throw the 
bundle open. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a very shallow understanding of Western stand-up comedy, but that 
rhythm is basically one setup and one punch line, so Chinese stand-up humor 
unfolds much more slowly and graciously. People (from other cultures) can get 
used to that rhythm, but it may take some adjusting." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Lai, today's Chinese stand-up comics base their repertory on 
century-old routines. He cited one "very beautiful, very funny" example in 
which the emperor dies, and all the Peking actors have to change jobs because 
singing is prohibited.  
</P>
<P>
 "They become street vendors," Lai related. "They're lousy at selling, but 
they're so good at the hawking itself that everybody comes to listen. The 
routine unfolds as a brilliant commentary on politics and repression." 
</P>
<P>
 "Chinese Comedy in the Late 20th Century," which also plays Jan. 14 and 15 at 
San Gabriel Auditorium, similarly balances light and dark elements.  
</P>
<P>
 "What is your attitude toward traditions that die, for instance?" Lai posed. 
"Perhaps you can say they should die, that people want fast and vulgar, not 
sophisticated and gracious. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "The special quality of this play is that we're dealing always with black, 
with the death of things. Yet it unfolds in such a way that the audience just 
laughs and laughs and laughs." 
</P>
<P>
 What: Performance Workshop's "Chinese Comedy in the Late 20th Century," in 
Mandarin. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Friday and Saturday, Jan. 7 and 8, at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Cheng Hall at Irvine Barclay Theatre, 4242 Campus Drive, Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: Take the San Diego (405) Freeway to the Jamboree Road exit and 
head south. Turn left onto Campus Drive.  
</P>
<P>
 Wherewithal: $10 to $35.

KID STUFF: LOUNGE WIZARDS; IN A PLAY ABOUT TEACHERS, HIGH-SCHOOLERS GLIMPSE 
FACULTIES AT REST 
</P>

<P>
 Like its namesake, John Twomey's new play, "Teachers' Lounge," wasn't built 
for teen-agers. But Twomey, a New York high school teacher and author, says 
he's willing to give older kids a look inside, and hopes they'll learn a thing 
or two from the experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Receiving its world premiere Tuesday through Feb. 6 at Laguna Playhouse's 
Moulton Theater, "Teachers' Lounge" focuses on the interaction between seven 
teachers in the faculty lounge of a fictional New York high school. The lounge, 
as Twomey describes it, is both a haven and a trap; a holding tank where people 
in various states of emotional disrepair share coffee and gallows humor. 
Theater officials bill the show as a "serious comedy" and discourage anyone 
younger than high school age from attending. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally written as a single scene for Twomey's masters' program, "Teachers' 
Lounge" went through several revisions before it came to the attention of 
Laguna Playhouse artistic director Andrew Barnicle, who ultimately selected it 
from some 200 scripts to open the second half of the theater's 1993-94 season. 
With input from Barnicle (who, by the way, spent seven years as a college 
professor), Twomey made further refinements to the script and will be in 
residence at the theater during the final week of rehearsal. 
</P>
<P>
 Twomey says he hopes that by opening night, audiences will find a show that, 
although targeted to adults, offers some important insights -- and hopefully a 
few good laughs -- for teen-agers as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think most students see teachers just as people who stand up in front of 
the room and talk for 40 minutes," Twomey mused during a phone interview from 
his home in Douglaston. "They don't realize that we come to school each day 
with all our own baggage, just like they do."  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure that some (students) think all their teachers are best friends and 
get together just to conspire against them," he added, laughing. " 'Teachers' 
Lounge' should show them otherwise," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the exception of one first-year teacher, the educators in Twomey's play 
are a battle-weary crew. The idealism with which they began their careers has 
been eroded by the demands of their students and their school administrators. 
The interaction between these "grizzled veterans," as Barnicle calls them, and 
the newcomer, and how it affects them personally and professionally, form the 
basis of the play. 
</P>
<P>
 A full-time English teacher at a vocational high school in Long Island City, 
Twomey says that his characters represent a cross-section of the attitudes and 
personalities he has confronted in his career, including his own frustrations 
as a new teacher. And, although his play is set in New York, he feels the 
problems and triumphs portrayed in it can be found to some degree in almost any 
high school in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teachers' Lounge" contains a small amount of profanity and a few references 
to sexual infidelity, although Twomey laughingly assures that the show is by no 
means "a David Mamet thing." 
</P>
<P>
 And, as Twomey hastens to point out, although it may contain cynical, 
occasionally dark humor, the play also has positive messages, and a few strong 
role models for students. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a woman in the play who is starting to burn out, but she really 
personifies what I think are the qualities of an exceptional teacher," said 
Twomey. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to have a good rapport with your students and be able to inspire 
confidence without ever being condescending. (Teaching) takes that, and more."

 Sick, sick I was of all the sniggering coming over my phone lines from absent 
friends. Sighing contentedly and watching the first gentle snowfalls of the 
Christmas season from places like Upstate New York and Vermont, they were 
twisting the knife as if it was a Cuisinart blade. 
</P>
<P>
 There I was, they said, sitting in the middle of wintertime paradise, dodging 
bullets when I wasn't mired in traffic and watching the 
economy/infrastructure/schools concept of civility and the good life decay. 
</P>
<P>
 They, on the other hand, were positively delighted to be cocooned in Gore-Tex 
until May. "Well, gotta throw another log on the fire and heat up the spiced 
cider. Keep your head down, yuk yuk." 
</P>
<P>
 I needed ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody who lives surrounded by permafrost was going to tell me I wasn't 
residing in the best of all possible worlds, even if bulletproof vests were 
getting harder to find. I needed to resurrect the most devastating boast of all 
in the Southern Californian's quiver: that one can frolic in the snow in the 
a.m. and can be strolling airily on the beach before the sun goes down. A 
one-day blitz through two distinct macro-climates. 
</P>
<P>
 What was more, I was going to prove that you didn't even have to alter your 
daily life significantly in order to do it. None of this getting out of bed at 
6 a.m. for a pre-dawn banzai run to the mountains. No, I was going to miss the 
traffic on the side of the angels, leaving Santa Ana at the far more civilized 
hour of 9:45. Which I did. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was lovely. Cool, slightly overcast, a bit breezy -- just enough to 
call for a ski sweater. And the traffic on the Riverside Freeway was humming 
along crisply, as if there had never been such a thing as the morning crush. 
</P>
<P>
 I got off the San Bernardino Freeway at Orange Street and headed for the misty 
foothills. It had gotten colder, but my window was still open, a sure sign of 
climatic superiority, of the unique victory of man over nature that is at the 
core of every Southern Californian's world view. 
</P>
<P>
 On the trip up the hill to Running Springs, however, I began to get nervous. 
There were no trucks slowing me down, true, but there was also no snow. I 
couldn't have a Holy Quest without snow. But then, just as the sign for the 
Running Springs turnoff appeared, so did patches of white along the highway. 
They got bigger and more frequent and brighter. Real snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Greedy by this time, I decided to find as much snow as I could, as quickly as 
possible. I turned east and headed toward the ski area at Snow Valley, about 
five miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 The parking lot at the lifts was nearly empty, even though the mountain was 
covered with snow. Much of it was man-made, but so what? It was beautifully 
groomed, and the few weekday skiers who were gliding around on it grinned a 
lot.  
</P>
<P>
 I ordered a hot chocolate at the lodge and spent a half hour sitting on the 
deck watching the mountain. The sky was almost blindingly bright.  
</P>
<P>
 Fulfilling a crucial part of the Great Boast, I made a few snowballs out of 
parking lot snow and flung them around indiscriminately. I'd forgotten how cold 
bare hands can get while making snowballs. No matter. I'd be wrapping them 
around a margarita (rocks, no salt) at the Cannery in about three hours. 
</P>
<P>
 First, however, I stopped at a Czech restaurant on the highway in Arrowbear 
("Czech Restaurant," the sign said with fine simplicity) and had an entirely 
satisfactory goulash and dumplings, real winter food. Then I pointed the car 
down the mountain and toward the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Wisps of cloud snaked across the highway from time to time, but I would be 
coming out of it soon, I knew.  
</P>
<P>
 Only, as I rolled through Redlands and Riverside, the sky got nothing but 
grayer. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Orange County line at Green River Golf Course, it began to rain. Big 
drops. By the time I made the Costa Mesa Freeway, my wipers were slashing water 
off the windshield in long, splashing sheets. This was not in the script. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, I thought vainly, it's just a squall. Maybe Newport Beach is wreathed 
in sunshine . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But no. Newport Beach was even more sodden than Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Balboa Island was all but deserted, even the frozen banana joint closed tight. 
Still, there was no wait at the ferry landing, and the short cruise to the 
peninsula was, as always, a fine little marvel. The beach, however, might as 
well have been attached to Long Island: deserted, except for a few people 
wearing what looked like Gore-Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 The made-to-order margarita at the Cannery was tasty, though. And I actually 
felt overdressed in the ski sweater. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, well, the sun will come out for the Super Bowl. I'll call Vermont during 
the game and gloat. 
</P>

SURFING: WORLD CHAMP DEREK HO USHERS IN NEW HOPE FOR HAWAIIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rick Fignetti and David Reyes, Rockin' Fig is Rick Fignetti, a Huntington 
Beach surfer/shop owner. Times staff writer David Reyes has reported on U.S. 
surf teams competing in Bali and Brazil. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With Derek Ho's victory in the Pipeline Masters clinching the 1993 world 
championship tour for him, it may signal a push by Hawaiians into the top 
circle of the Assn. of Surfing Professionals (ASP). 
</P>
<P>
 "And, I think it's the first time that a Hawaiian has ever won the world 
title, " Rockin' Fig said. 
</P>
<P>
 And he's right. Ho is, indeed, the first Hawaiian to win in the 18-year 
history of the world circuit, the ASP confirmed. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Hawaiians originated the sport that is intertwined in island folklore, 
only a few Hawaiian pros have ever cracked the Top 10. In fact, the upper rungs 
of the competitive ladder have been held mostly by Australian and U.S. surfers. 
</P>
<P>
 Fig and I called Ho at his Oahu residence to congratulate him and talk about 
his victory. 
</P>
<P>
 We're pretty stoked for you , Derek . You're the first Hawaiian!  
</P>
<P>
 "It's been pretty exciting," said a very happy-sounding Ho. "And, busy. My 
phone hasn't stopped ringing. And, my message machine has been swamped. 
Everybody wants to know about me." 
</P>
<P>
 No fewer than six pro surfers had a shot at the world championship, and it all 
came down to the Pipeline contest. The other five were Australians Gary 
Elkerton, Dave Macaulay and Damien Hardman, and Americans Rob Machado of 
Cardiff and defending champion Kelly Slater of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Ho was in fifth place on the tour coming into Hawaii with one event left.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of things had to happen," he said, recalling that Pipeline had four- to 
seven-foot waves with larger sets. "Classic Pipe." 
</P>
<P>
 Elkerton, who placed second to Ho in the world ratings, was devastated after 
the semifinal. He was only seconds away from qualifying for the Masters final 
and a shot at the title, but a strong ride by Larry Rios, another Hawaiian, 
pushed Elkerton into third place. 
</P>
<P>
 Did you know before the finals that you had clinched the tour?  
</P>
<P>
 "Well, once Elkerton got eliminated in the semifinal, I thought I had to win 
the contest to win the title," Ho explained. "But later I heard that I only had 
to take a second. The pressure was still there, though. You know, Pipe is the 
place where if you make one little mistake . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 How did you feel when Rios took out Elkerton?  
</P>
<P>
 "That was a big moment. When he took out Elkerton, it was big for the 
Hawaiians. When you go out in a heat like Elkerton did and you've got a shot at 
the big title, it's big. (Remember,) it doesn't matter if you take first or 
second in a contest. You got to make the final. That's the big thing." 
</P>
<P>
 We've seen Australians , a couple of Californians and Slater take the title. 
This has gotta bring some glory to the guys in the islands.  
</P>
<P>
 "I definitely think it's a door-opening situation," Ho said. "I think it's 
opened a door for Sunny (Garcia, who finished 10th on the 1993 tour) and Kaipo 
(Jaquias, who finished 26th) because they definitely have the potential for 
world status. For me, doing it at this age, it says something too." 
</P>
<P>
 At 29, and a father of an 18-month-old daughter, Ho also became the oldest 
world champion. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't sure if this was his seventh or eighth time he made a Pipeline 
final. It was, though, definitely his second Masters victory. 
</P>
<P>
 I asked Ho why he competed earlier in the year at Imperial Beach, Calif., of 
all places, at a U.S. Bud Tour event. It's like Lenny Dykstra of the 
Philadelphia Phillies visiting a triple AAA ball club and asking to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Ho won the contest in dinky surf, which, he said, was part of an overall 
strategy to try and win every contest he entered in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a confidence booster for me," Ho said. "To show up and win in one- 
to two-foot surf and to beat guys like Rob Machado, who are great in small 
surf." 
</P>
<P>
 Hey, people on the Bud Tour a re stoked to get great pros on their tour. It 
pumps it up.  
</P>
<P>
 Ho said we caught him just going out the door to the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, Fig," Ho said, with a slight dig. "The waves are about four to six 
feet." 
</P>
<P>
 I asked where he was headed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, Pipeline or Backdoor." 
</P>
<P>
 Rough choice, eh? 
</P>
<P>
 Derek, what are your '94 plans.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm coming back and defending the title. Hey, tell the Huntington boys, 
'Right on!' for supporting me and congratulating me. Huntington is like my home 
when I come to California." 
</P>
<P>
 More Gifts: Ann Beasley, Huntington Beach International Surfing Museum 
director, thanked graphic artists Forrest Healy and Eric Speigler, both of 
Newport Beach for creating new museum posters as fund-raisers. Beasley said an 
anonymous benefactor put up $2,000 to print them as a Christmas gift to the 
museum. One of the poster slogans read: "We were built on sand, water and zinc 
oxide." 
</P>
<P>
 The big THREE OH! San Clemente-based SURFING magazine celebrates its 30th 
anniversary in 1994. The magazine plans to publish three collector editions 
this year, "30 Epic Photos," "30 Greatest Moments in Surfing History," and "The 
30 Biggest Waves Ever Ridden." 
</P>
<P>
 Offshore: There have been some fun days with north, northwest swells rolling 
through and lots of offshore winds. Fig heard Rincon was pumping and scored an 
epic day of good, head-high plus sets.

 If the Orange County Half Marathon is back, it must be time for the 
Southland's marathon season. 
</P>
<P>
 With each year, the 13.1-mile run becomes more of a traditional kickoff to the 
season. Last year, about 2,400 runners took part; when the event returns to 
Irvine on Sunday, organizers say, there will be at least 3,600 runners. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're four weeks before Long Beach and a couple of months before Los 
Angeles," said organizer Kim Westerbeck of Winslow Promotions, referring to the 
sites of Southern California's two biggest marathons. The timing of Sunday's 
event makes it a popular warm-up for long-distance runners. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, L.A. Marathon officials have designated Sunday's run an "official" 
warm-up for their own race, held each year on the first Sunday in March. The 
expected field in Irvine includes more than 1,000 inner-city youths training 
for the L.A. event. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our numbers are already 30% higher than they were last year at this time," 
Westerbeck said. 
</P>
<P>
 The course for the half marathon has changed slightly from last year, although 
it still follows the San Diego Creek bike trail for most of its length. It now 
starts and finishes at the Woodbridge Village Shopping Center, at Barranca 
Parkway and Lake Road in Irvine. There will be some climbing on the course, 
which winds through rolling hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The event also includes a separate run, the O.C. 5000, with a very flat and 
fast course. About 400 runners are expected, in addition to those running the 
half marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 Race-day registration will be offered. Also, participants can register from 5 
to 9 p.m. Friday in the Center Court area of the shopping center. Some of the 
proceeds from the event will benefit the Woodbridge High School athletic 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 What: Orange County Half Marathon and O.C. 5000.  
</P>
<P>
 When: Saturday, Jan. 8, at 8 a.m. (race-day registration from 6:30 to 7:45 
a.m.). 
</P>
<P>
 Where: Woodbridge Village Shopping Center, Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereabouts: From the San Diego (405) Freeway, exit at Culver Drive and head 
north. Turn right on Barranca Parkway, then right on Lake Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Wherewithal: $22 for half marathon, $20 for 5K (includes T-shirt). 
</P>
<P>
 Where to call: (714) 841-5883.

CRAFTS; VOLUNTEER KNITTERS LATCH ON TO PLAN TO WARM UP AMERICA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, Zan Dubin covers the arts for The Times Orange County Edition.

 Craft store owner Teri November has a message for Bill Clinton: "I really 
think (he) is missing something by not putting everyone into action." 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteer action is what November means, and she's been advocating it since 
hooking up with Warm Up America!, a nationwide volunteer program that provides 
the homeless and others with handmade afghans. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past year or so, November's Arts 'n Crafts 'n Things supply shop in 
Orange has turned out 42 afghans produced by store patrons and other 
craftspeople. They've jumped at the chance to pitch in, November said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have been tremendously responsive," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really, really want to volunteer and do something to help the situation 
we are in, which is terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 Evie Rosen, owner of the Knitting Nook store in Wausau, Wis., created the 
program about three years ago with a seed grant from the National Needlework 
Assn., a trade association based in Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosen estimates that to date, 12,000 afghans have been produced nationwide and 
donated to shelters for abused women and children, AIDS patients, the elderly 
and flood and hurricane victims, as well as to the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to continue doing this as long as there's a need," she said in a 
recent phone interview from Wausau. 
</P>
<P>
 Afghans made by patrons at November's store are delivered to the YWCA in 
Orange, which passes them on through its Project H.o.p.e. School for homeless 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers have several options: They may knit or crochet an entire afghan, or 
make squares or long strips to be stitched together into blankets by other 
volunteers. At present, November has enough individual squares for nine 
afghans, so those who wish to stitch squares together are needed most. The 
store also accepts donations of yarn. 
</P>
<P>
 Afghan size, stitch type, color and pattern are left up to each craftsperson, 
but most follow instructions issued by Warm Up America! and available at 
November's store or through the National Needlework Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 The instructions recommend that blankets be made with worsted-weight yarn and 
measure 49 by 63 inches. Individual squares should be 7 by 9 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Using leftover yarn she had at home, needleworker Chris Hoppe of Orange has 
knitted one multicolored afghan and about 30 squares, many of which she's taken 
to November's store for completion by others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I probably get more out of it than the person receiving it," Hoppe 
said. "It's a feeling of satisfaction, knowing that your talent can be used to 
help someone." 
</P>
<P>
 A wall display in November's store tallies the current number of afghans 
completed and the number yet to be created. November's goal? 
</P>
<P>
 "One thousand," she said. "I like to think big."

CHEF DU JOUR: FROM SURF TO SWEET POTATO PIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT, Patrick Mott is a frequent contributor to The Times Orange 
County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's difficult to know whether to think of Mike Baker as a surfing chef or as 
a chef who surfs. In either case, he doesn't look the part. 
</P>
<P>
 Well beyond six feet and with the build of a defensive lineman, Baker, the 
chef at Buffalo Ranch restaurant in Mission Viejo, looks as if he couldn't be 
supported in the water by a surfboard any smaller than a barge and has none of 
the fussy, precision manner of the mythical temperamental chef. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the youthfully enthusiastic Baker still lards his conversation 
with time-honored surfer language (if he's excited, he's "stoked"), and, during 
the past 12 months, his enthusiasm has been centered on Buffalo Ranch, a 
family-style steakhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a quiet dining atmosphere," the San Juan Capistrano resident said, 
smiling. "We encourage people to get up and dance with the employees every half 
hour. And if people go away saying 'I'm stuffed!' then I feel like we did our 
job." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker, a graduate of Corona del Mar High School and Golden West College in 
Huntington Beach (he studied business), began his association with restaurants 
when he was 12, working in a Belgian waffle restaurant on Balboa Island as a 
dish washer. ("They'd feed me, and I was making money to buy surfboards.") 
</P>
<P>
 "I went through the ranks," he said. "On-the-job training was best for me, and 
there were really great people along the way who took time to teach me." 
</P>
<P>
 After a short time as a kitchen worker at Reuben's in Newport Beach, Baker 
worked from 1976 to 1984 as a broiler man, waiter and manager at Josh Slocum's 
restaurant in that city. From 1984 to 1993, he worked as the head waiter and 
manager of the Chart House in Dana Point. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, he is one of his own best customers. He has one of Buffalo Ranch's 
signature buffalo burgers each day -- "less fat," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And occasionally he whips up something off the menu, such as his sweet potato 
pie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally don't like pumpkin pie," he said, "but this is fantastic. When I 
first did this, there was a lot of word of mouth among the employees, and they 
all sampled it about five or 10 times." 
</P>

 Preparation, Baker said, is fairly simple, but he warned that the home cook 
should "make sure the sweet potatoes are cooked correctly and cooled down 
completely, because the puree is the major part of the process."

REWIND: A STORY OF SPIRITUAL BEWARENESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET KINOSIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Writer-director Mike Hodges conjures up a weird, dreary world in "Black 
Rainbow," a supernatural thriller about a fake medium (Rosanna Arquette) -- who 
might not be a fake after all -- and a crooked corporation killing off its 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha Travis calls herself "a spiritual telephone exchange," transmitting 
messages from the dead to their survivors, as her drunken father drums up 
business along the Bible Belt. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha performs in front of the audience in white robes, on a rosewood carved 
chair with organ music in the background, turning her head to the side as if 
listening to the dead. 
</P>
<P>
 She relays a typical message to one woman: Husband Tommy is doing fine "on the 
other side," after his bloody murder. But the woman says Martha has got the 
wrong man -- that her husband is alive and well and watching TV. The woman 
returns home, finding her husband as she left him. Minutes later, however, he 
dies in the violent way that the clairvoyant had described. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha continues her public hereafter telephone conversations with people who 
aren't yet dead. And soon she is hunted by the law -- and a hit man. 
</P>
<P>
 The atmosphere is modern Southern Gothic -- full of revivalist religion, 
reactionary corruption and steamy sex. The cast is above-par, especially 
Arquette, who makes the most of her angel-slut role. 
</P>
<P>
 The film ends with many unanswered, or partially answered, questions. But 
that's the central fun of this film. 
</P>
<P>
 "Black Rainbow" (1991), directed by Mike Hodges. 103 Minutes. Rated R.

SPECIAL SCREENINGS: 2 CLASSICS FROM '50S ANCHOR SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The UC Irvine "Tragedy and Comedy" film series, which runs from Jan. 14 to 
March 18, spotlights two of the more memorable movies to come out of the '50s. 
The programs begins with Akira Kurosawa's "Rashomon" and offers Jean-Luc 
Godard's "Breathless" a few weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurosawa's 1950 movie, one of the finest in the Japanese director's great 
library, is a masterpiece of cinematic style. The film uses flashback upon 
flashback to offer different interpretations of a man's murder and the rape of 
his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "Breathless" arrives Feb. 11. This 1959 milestone of the French New Wave 
features Jean-Paul Belmondo as the young criminal on the run with Jean Seberg 
as his American girlfriend along for the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the series features a mix of international fare. Following 
"Rashomon," on Jan. 21, is Wayne Wang's "Chan Is Missing." The U.S. director, 
probably best known for the recent "The Joy Luck Club," takes a couple of 
cabbies through a cockeyed adventure as they search for the guy who stole their 
savings in this 1982 picture. 
</P>
<P>
 The French are represented againwith Coline Serreau's "Mama, There's a Man in 
Your Bed," which screens Jan. 28. This socially responsible comedy from 1989 
focuses on the love affair between a wealthy white man and the black woman who 
cleans his office. 
</P>
<P>
 William Wyler's 1949 movie, "The Heiress," will be shown Feb. 4. In this 
adaptation of Henry James' novel, Montgomery Clift plays a gigolo trying to win 
the affections (and money) of a naive woman played by Olivia de Haviland. 
</P>
<P>
 The stylish wit of Ernst Lubitsch is on display Feb. 18 with one of his better 
films, "Trouble in Paradise." The series flyer describes the 1932 picture this 
way: "Sparkling bubbles of decadence and a light froth of amorality are served 
up . . . in this sophisticated comedy about two jewel thieves who infiltrate 
the household of a rich Parisian and live a life of crime without punishment." 
</P>
<P>
 An obscure offering from China will be presented Feb. 25. Clara Law's "The 
Reincarnation of Golden Lotus" from 1989 tells the story of a long-dead 
courtesan who is reincarnated in Shanghai during the height of the Cultural 
Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Yoshimitsu Morita's "The Family Game" is set for March 4. The Japanese 
director's 1984 satire centers on a bed-hopping tutor hired to prepare a young 
student for academic life. 
</P>
<P>
 A German silent from F. W. Murnau is scheduled for March 11. "The Last Laugh," 
first released in 1924, follows the emotional collapse of a hotel doorman who 
loses his job and is forced to evaluate his life. 
</P>
<P>
 The program closes March 18 with Pedro Almodovar's 1990 movie, "Tie Me Up! Tie 
Me Down!" The Spanish director enjoys thrusting unusual folks into bizarre 
situations; this time, a handsome mental patient and a lovely porn star find a 
weird kind of love after he kidnaps her. 
</P>
<P>

KIDS ON FILM: GRIM REALITY COLORS 'SCHINDLER'S LIST' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Lynn Smith is a staff writer for The Times' View section.

<P>
 In "Schindler's List," the hedonistic opportunist Oskar Schindler makes a 
fortune in World War II using Polish Jews as slave labor, but then, unable to 
deny the murderous evil of his Nazi friends, he turns his attention and profits 
to saving 1,100 of his workers from the Auschwitz death camp. (Rated R)  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, Eric and Samia Friedrichsen do not take their children, 11 and 13, 
to R-rated movies. But this one is different. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric, a descendant of German soldiers, and Samia, a descendant of 
Palestinians, wanted them to understand the reality of those dark years that 
horrified the world and affected their own personal history. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopefully, Samia said, the movie's emotional impact would outweigh 
intellectual arguments -- including in her homeland -- that the Holocaust never 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a grim, three-hour movie in black and white, but the children said it 
kept their interest throughout and they gained information about the Holocaust. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, I didn't know it was that bad," said Samia's son, Ramy Dodin, 11. "I 
didn't know so many people got killed." 
</P>
<P>
 His sister, Reema, 13, said, "You never get facts. This movie, it opens you."  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to historical dates and places, she said she learned more about 
how it happened, "that they would shoot people for being educated, or just for 
really dumb reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't really believe that could actually happen. But people usually 
believe the movies they see, and I suppose it's true." 
</P>
<P>
 Reema said she recalls fellow students in the fifth grade claiming the 
Holocaust never happened in the same way they would claim Elvis is alive. Now a 
student in Amman, Jordan, where she is living temporarily with her father, she 
said the movie "won't make it there. Not a movie like that."  
</P>
<P>
 Reema's friend Kerstin Mikalbrown, 13, who went with the family, said her 
father and stepmother are Jewish and that she already knew many facts about the 
Holocaust.  
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't know how it happened. Like, they would shoot people at random. 
I didn't understand it until I saw it. I remember when (the camp commander) was 
at the window in the morning with a gun and he was just shooting people 
randomly . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Reema finished the thought: "Just to amuse himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Other powerful images that children might take away with them include those of 
other children: a boy hiding from soldiers in the sludge of an outhouse; a girl 
being ripped from her mother's arms; the heroism of a small German boy lying to 
soldiers to save his Jewish friends; the heart-ripping courage of a Jewish boy 
in the camps who witnesses the murder of an innocent man after no one admits to 
a petty theft.  
</P>
<P>
 "I know who did it," he confesses, trembling. "He did," he says pointing to 
the just-murdered man. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie's terror builds to a mid-movie climax with the liquidation of the 
Warsaw ghetto, whose scenes of chaos, fear and murder lingered longest in the 
children's minds. After that, scenes of mass slaughter and layers of bodies 
were almost numbing.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is strong, frightening and sorrowful material -- for any age. The 
question for parents is, when are their own children ready for it? 
</P>
<P>
 Those who saw it agreed it wasn't for everybody.  
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, it wasn't that bad," Ramy said. "But it was scary at some points 
where there was a lot of violence." 
</P>
<P>
 He advised other children to see it if they can. "But if you don't think they 
can handle it, they shouldn't see it," he added. "I thought it was good, but it 
was very sad also." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kerstin: "I think parents know their kids. If they think their kids can 
emotionally handle it, I think it's a really important movie for them to see."

TASTY FARE IN A HOMEY SETTING; AT SHANE, WILD IS OUT, DELICIOUS IS IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for The Times Orange County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Superstar Wolfgang Puck (whose South Coast Plaza pizza cafe will be reviewed 
in next week's OC Live!) has spawned an entire generation of young American 
chefs. One is Michael Kurland, who trained with Puck at the '70s celebrity 
hangout Ma Maison while Kurland was still in high school. Kurland is now 
executive chef at Shane in Newport Beach. He's the one wearing a baseball cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Shane -- formerly Barbacoa -- is the latest project from West Coast Restaurant 
Ventures, the Orange County-based company responsible for such standouts as 
Diva, Bistro 201 and Topaz Cafe. Some of you may recall that the colorful David 
Wilhelm was a major player with this company before his recent well-publicized 
departure. Barbacoa, which preceded Shane at this location, was one of 
Wilhelm's notable failures. With a bizarre, tropically themed menu and a 
quasi-psychedelic decor, Barbacoa was clearly too wild for the staid Newport 
Harbor crowd. Shane, oddly enough, may be too sedate. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kurland should take care of that problem in time. Now that the long, sleek 
room has been warmed up considerably (it's been redone in soft beiges and 
polished woods), there is time for him to redefine the menu. Kurland is chef 
and part owner of another Shane, located in Los Angeles and technically named 
Shane Hidden on the Glen, and there you find things like smoked cod and 
horseradish on pizza, rosemary and lime on chicken and the occasional Asian 
influences on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 It's different here. Despite the fact that Kurland's background includes a 
stint with Kazuto Matsusaka at Chinois on Main and Italian cooking experience 
at a Melrose Avenue trattoria called La Pasteria, he is still a bit cautious in 
terms of strutting his stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 The subtitle of the restaurant is "An American Grill," and so far, Kurland and 
West Coast Restaurant Ventures are sticking to their guns. Their small, concise 
menu reads like a short list of hip '90s dishes: crab cakes, Caesar salad, 
designer pizza, light pastas, mesquite-grilled meats. Don't look for any 
surprises on this menu, because you won't find them. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the current wisdom may well turn out to be the wise course. It's 
homey in here now, thanks to soft lighting, well-spaced tables and panoramic 
windows, which afford a close-up view of yachts, Lido Island and the whole 
Newport lifestyle. The crowd is considerably older now, too. Barbacoa tried to 
be a nightclub, featuring cutting-edge electric bands on weekends. Think of 
Shane more as a supper club. What you hear now is likely to be '50s cocktail 
music played by a jazz trio. 
</P>
<P>
 One eating strategy is to start off with hearty, filling dishes like Kurland's 
warm spinach salad or Maryland crab cakes, then finish with a pasta. Another 
would be to start light, with house salad, a light soup or half a pasta, and 
then progress to one of the peerless home-smoked and grilled meats. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu tells us that the warm spinach, hot bacon and goat cheese salad 
speaks for itself. Indeed it does. This is just a wonderful salad: savory, not 
sweet, thanks to an adult vinaigrette dressing chock-full of smoky bacon; 
robust from an intelligent clump of half-melted goat cheese atop the fresh hot 
greens. Good, flaky crab cakes have a buttery tang. You can enrich them further 
by daubing them with a bit of Kurland's unctuous saffron aioli mayonnaise. 
</P>
<P>
 If I were beginning a meal here with one of those starters, I would surely 
choose the chicken risotto as my main course. This may be the best dish in the 
restaurant: arborio rice laced with porcini mushrooms, a pile of sweetly smoky 
chicken mixed in and a grated Parmesan topping. Another possibility would be 
the delicate vegetarian ravioli, stuffed with an airy souffle of spinach and 
ricotta. 
</P>
<P>
 But if I had a craving for ribs, chicken, lamb or salmon, I'd start more 
modestly. There is, for instance, a flavorful white bean soup that draws much 
of its strength from chopped tomatoes and aromatic herbs, and a house salad of 
baby mixed greens enlivened by balsamic vinegar and whole-grain mustard 
dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu has three pizzas, too, from the bready school of pizza making. One is 
a conventional cheese, tomato and basil pizza, but the other two are mildly 
eccentric -- a cheese-less version with grilled vegetables and a spicy BBQ 
chicken pizza sweetened by a residue of barbecue sauce and caramelized Bermuda 
onion. 
</P>
<P>
 Kurland smokes his meats in a wood smoker, finishing them on a grill fired by 
mesquite embers. Mesquite tends to make foods dry, but I like the quality. One 
evening I had a great chunk of Norwegian salmon, another I had the best baby 
back ribs yet served in Orange County. Kansas City BBQ brisket of beef is a 
popular item, but the beef needs to be a touch more tender. New York steak and 
wood-fired baby lamb rack are both fine, though. Further, the accompaniments -- 
such as festive-looking cole slaw, crisp shoestring french fries and sloppy 
creamed corn -- are all first rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Ditto the five desserts. The creme brulee is properly rich, the warm flourless 
chocolate torte has a fudgy center and the Mexican chocolate brownie is 
firm-textured, bittersweet and intense. Kurland's peach cobbler is definitely 
nouvelle; the peaches come fanned out on the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the kind of dessert young American chefs relish, mother's 
homemade cookies. Picture a plate of cutup chocolate chip and oatmeal cookies, 
a veritable swimming pool of runny chocolate sauce and two scoops of vanilla 
bean ice cream. Then be thankful that "mother" is a thirtysomething blond guy 
in a baseball cap with Wolfgang in his resume. 
</P>
<P>
 Shane is high-end moderate. Starters are $3.95 to $8.95. Pizzas are $9.95.

GOVERNOR CALLS FOR MORE JOBS AND PRISONS, TAX REDUCTIONS; CALIFORNIA: WILSON 
SAYS FAMILIES EARNING UNDER $40,000, SOME FIRMS SHOULD GET BREAKS. HE TERMS NEW 
JOBS AND CRIME REDUCTION 'TWIN PILLARS OF THE FUTURE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing job creation and crime reduction as the "twin pillars" on which he 
hopes to build California's future, Gov. Pete Wilson on Wednesday proposed 
rewarding businesses that hire new workers and punishing more harshly violent 
criminals who repeatedly break the law. 
</P>
<P>
 In an election-year State of the State Address to a joint session of the 
Legislature, the Republican governor returned to two themes that helped him win 
the state's highest office in 1990: taxes and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson proposed a $50 tax credit for families earning less than $40,000 a 
year. He called for putting more police on the street by hiring 500 new Highway 
Patrol officers and assigning them to local communities, and he said the state 
should construct six new prisons to hold more criminals serving longer 
sentences than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor did not say how the cash-strapped state government could afford 
to cut taxes and boost anti-crime spending at the same time, and Democratic 
legislative leaders, reacting to the speech, accused him of making 
election-year promises that he knows he cannot keep. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's speech made almost no mention of education -- always a top issue in 
the state -- and only a passing reference to illegal immigration, a topic the 
governor hammered at time and again during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Combining a pointed attack on federal policy-makers with a conciliatory call 
for bipartisan action on state problems, Wilson urged lawmakers to build on a 
year of cooperative efforts in which he and the Legislature enacted a package 
of bills intended to make California a better place in which to do business. 
</P>
<P>
 The instant critique from Orange County lawmakers, businessmen and law 
enforcement officials was largely positive, but also laced with skepticism 
about some of the governor's strategies and the Legislature's will to launch 
his programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson put further behind him his negative rhetoric of 1992, when he 
complained in his State of the State speech that California had "lost much of 
its competitive edge" and warned that the changes he wanted would "cause 
discomfort." The only discomfort he promised in this speech was for the state's 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson linked his two key issues by insisting that companies will not build 
new plants or expand existing ones in a state where their customers and workers 
do not feel secure in their homes or on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "New jobs and safe streets are the twin pillars on which we must build 
California's future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's fourth State of the State speech was received politely in the ornate 
Assembly chamber dominated by Democrats. His 30-minute address was interrupted 
15 times by applause. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two Democrats who are vying to oppose Wilson in the fall -- state 
Treasurer Kathleen Brown and Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi -- said they 
doubted his ability to provide the leadership needed to get the job done. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can get California moving forward again, but it's going to take common 
sense, hard work and, above all, realistic solutions," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi said Wilson has had three years to turn the state around but has 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, we've been on the wrong track," he said. "He's had three 
swings at the bat, and in baseball, when you miss three times, you're out." 
</P>
<P>
 Legislative leaders said Wilson's speech was unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti of Van Nuys said Wilson was in a 
"campaign mode," cynically promising to boost public safety funding while 
cutting taxes, a pledge Roberti said the governor cannot keep. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was plainly an election-year speech," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's staunchly conservative state delegation hasn't always agreed 
with the moderate governor, but it still gave Wilson's address mostly rave 
reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. John Lewis (R-Orange) said the speech had "a little more meat this year," 
and Sen. Rob Hurtt (R-Garden Grove) praised the governor for stressing business 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Bill Morrow (R-Oceanside), whose district includes a large swath 
of South County, said he was disappointed that the governor didn't address 
strategies to combat illegal immigration, but he was delighted to hear the 
words "tax cut." 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic Assemblyman John Vasconcellos of Santa Clara, the Assembly's lead 
budget writer, called Wilson's speech "an embarrassment" because it seemed 
calculated to appeal to voters at the expense of fiscal responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just does not add up," Vasconcellos said. "I am against crime and for new 
jobs too. But we also have a constitutional obligation to balance the budget." 
</P>
<P>
 But Assembly Republican Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga called it a 
"good speech" that could set the tone for another harmonious legislative 
session. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Democrats will cooperate as they did last year, we will have a very 
productive session and California will become safer as well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor proposed a $1,000 tax credit for each job, up to 100, created in 
any start-up small businesses over the next two years. And his proposed $50 tax 
credit would amount to an 18% tax cut for the average couple earning less than 
$40,000. Last year, at Wilson's insistence, the state suspended the renters tax 
credit, which granted credits of up to $120 for tenants in the same income 
group that Wilson says he now wants to help. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's aides said the governor's proposed tax cuts would cost about $140 
million -- in a general fund budget of about $40 billion. A tax cut for 
lower-income wage earners, while affecting a large number of people, is 
relatively inexpensive for the state because people in that income group do not 
pay very much in taxes to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said he might seek more tax cuts as the year progresses. "California 
must go further in making our tax structure competitive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also called for reduced regulations and paperwork and a doubling of the 
state's export finance program. He repeated his call to abolish the state 
Energy Commission, added the Integrated Waste Management Board to his hit list 
and suggested that the state trim middle management jobs by 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson complained that the state's efforts often are thwarted by the federal 
government. Every time the state takes a step forward, a "giant push back" 
comes from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just that further defense cuts are idling aerospace workers," Wilson 
said. "Federal water cuts are squeezing our farmers. A failed immigration 
policy is busting our budget. And higher federal taxes are pinching our 
wallets." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Orange County business community there was support for the ideas, but 
doubts about the governor's ability to launch his programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best part for me was the $1,000 tax credit for creating new jobs. That 
was very encouraging," said Donna Hahn, owner of a small public relations and 
marketing firm in Lake Forest. "It was about time we hear this kind of talk 
from the chief executive, but now we have to see what the Legislature is going 
to do about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the Legislature did agree, economist Esmael Adibi doubted there was 
anything in Wilson's plan that would adequately finance the programs he called 
for. 
</P>
<P>
 "He should have offered specific cuts in government spending to pay for it 
all," said Adibi, director of the Chapman University Center for Economic 
Research in Orange. Adibi also criticized Wilson for "not telling the truth" 
about his Administration's job-cutting record. While the governor seemed to 
offer 22,000 unfilled state jobs as a sign that his Administration has reduced 
state employment, Adibi said that California government payrolls have grown in 
the past two years "while almost 500,000 jobs have been lost" in the civilian 
sector of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 On crime, Wilson said the state needs to focus on three points: more police on 
the street, improved programs to keep children from turning to crime and 
stiffer sentences for violent offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 He made two references to Polly Klaas, the 12-year-old Petaluma girl who was 
kidnaped from her home and murdered, and to Richard Allen Davis, the repeat 
felon who has confessed to the crime. Wilson called Davis an "animal" who 
should never have been released from prison. Marc Klaas, Polly's father, 
watched from the gallery at Wilson's invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite calling for a greater effort to keep children from becoming criminals, 
Wilson said the state must deal strictly with those who do stray. Children as 
young as 14 who commit violent crimes, he said, should be tried as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sympathize with those neglected children who are tempted by drugs or 
gangs," Wilson said. "But when as teen-agers or adults they victimize others, 
our sympathy must yield to responsibility. And our first responsibility must be 
always to protect the innocent and punish the guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Wilson said, more than 400 children were murdered in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our streets are stained with the blood of our children, and it's got to 
stop," Wilson said, his voice rising. "Damn it, it's got to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson proposed hiring 500 new California Highway Patrol officers and 
assigning them to high-crime communities to help local police. He cited a 
special program in the city of East Palo Alto where a regional crime-fighting 
effort reduced the murder rate by 86%. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also repeated his call for adoption of the "three strikes" measure to 
lock up three-time violent felons for life. If the Legislature does not pass 
the measure, he said, the voters will enact the proposal as a ballot 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 For certain arsonists and sexual offenders, Wilson said, the punishment should 
be even swifter: life in prison for the first offense. Repeat felons caught 
with a gun should face the same fate, he said. Credits allowing prisoners to 
cut their sentences in half by working and behaving well while behind bars 
should be curtailed, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to turn career criminals into career inmates," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor said the state should build six new prisons -- adding to the 26 
already housing more than 110,000 inmates -- financed by a $2-billion bond 
measure he wants to put before voters later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson acknowledged that the anti-crime effort would be expensive. He said he 
would rather spend the money on universities than prisons. But the state, he 
said, has no choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does anyone want to tell me how much a child's life is worth? Does anyone 
want to assign a dollar value to the lives of 400 murdered children?" Wilson 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's pledge to target career criminals and violent teens was applauded by 
Orange County law enforcement officials although some had reservations about 
his idea to create a CHP strike force. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why not take the funding for those officers and give them to the local 
jurisdictions that have a better feel for the problem?" said Orange Police 
Chief John R. Robertson, who estimated the cost of training 20 CHP officers at 
about $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove Mayor Frank Kessler, a former police chief in the city, said the 
governor was addressing issues that people are talking about, and Westminster 
Police Chief James Cook also praised Wilson's proposals to prosecute violent 
teens as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need to understand that there are real consequences to what they do," 
Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson made few attempts at soaring rhetoric and outlined no expansive vision 
for the state's future, as he did in his first State of the State speech in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Californians, he said, are less concerned about the coming century than "about 
the security of their job today and the safety of their family tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 But neither did Wilson lay down a controversial agenda like the one he 
proposed in 1992, when he waged confrontational, partisan conflict with the 
Democrats in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 An adviser agreed that Wilson's address was high on practical proposals and 
short on memorable flourishes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a no-frills, nuts-and-bolts kind of speech," said Dan Schnur, Wilson's 
campaign spokesman.

CHARITY PATIENTS IRRADIATED TO GAUGE EFFECT ON SOLDIERS; RADIATION: EXPERIMENTS 
ON 82 PEOPLE WITH CANCER LASTED UNTIL 1972. SIXTY DAYS AFTER EXPOSURE, 25 HAD 
DIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Over a dozen years, ending in 1972, at least 82 charity patients at the 
University of Cincinnati Medical Center were exposed to powerful full- and 
partial-body radiation in a study designed to gauge exposure levels for 
soldiers, according to documents being reviewed by the Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The experimental subjects -- of whom 61 were low-income black men and women -- 
were cancer patients whose illnesses were deemed untreatable, although all 
still were considered to be in "relatively good health." Many even continued to 
work every day. But within 60 days after exposure to radiation 10 times higher 
than that believed safe at the time, 25 of the patients died. 
</P>
<P>
 The experiments were conducted by Eugene L. Saenger, an eminent radiological 
health specialist, and they prompted the University of Cincinnati's Junior 
Faculty Assn. to conclude in 1972 that "many patients paid severely for their 
participation and often without even knowing that they were part of an 
experiment." 
</P>
<P>
 Saenger himself, in a report to the Defense Department, acknowledged that "one 
can identify eight cases in which there is a possibility of the therapy 
contributing to mortality." 
</P>
<P>
 Saenger -- and others who conducted experiments now under review -- continues 
to testify as an expert witness in suits against the U.S. Energy Department by 
nuclear production workers and communities seeking compensation for radiation 
exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cincinnati case poses a significant dilemma for the department, which has 
vowed to "come clean" on such experiments. Much of the technical expertise it 
has used to fend off lawsuits is derived from experiments whose methods are now 
being called into question. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cincinnati experiments, which were the subject of a Senate hearing in 
1972, also show that human radiation tests were conducted well beyond the 1940s 
and 1950s, when knowledge about nuclear radiation remained crude. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the Saenger experiments provide dramatic evidence that an 
interagency task force formed Monday by the Clinton Administration to review 
the human experimentation will have to breach a wall of secrecy at the 
Pentagon, as well as at organizations like the Energy Department and its 
predecessor, the Atomic Energy Commission, which already have been implicated. 
The Defense Department spent $651,000 to support the Cincinnati experiments. 
</P>
<P>
 Energy Department officials and a burgeoning army of federal investigators are 
reviewing the Cincinnati experiments as they comb through thousands of pages of 
documents on Cold War experimentation in which humans, often without being 
told, were exposed to radiation. Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary has said she 
was "appalled, shocked and deeply saddened" to learn of an earlier experiment, 
in which 18 individuals were injected with plutonium, and has vowed to lead a 
review of such Cold War practices sponsored by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not known whether any of those who were subjects in the Cincinnati 
experiments are still living. In 1971, when details of the experiments first 
emerged, six of the patients were believed to be alive. Saenger, now professor 
emeritus of radiology at the University of Cincinnati Medical Center, did not 
return numerous telephone calls from The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's investigation of the Cincinnati experiments is expected to 
focus on key issues of medical ethics raised by long-secret radiation 
experiments involving humans: whether patients were told of their status as 
experimental subjects and whether they explicitly agreed to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 A report by the Junior Faculty Assn. noted that for the first five years of 
Saenger's study -- when almost 48 patients were exposed to full-body radiation 
-- "patients seem to have been told nothing except that the radiation was part 
of their treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 The informed consent of patients was further complicated by the fact that the 
affected patients had a median IQ of 87. An IQ of 100 is considered average. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1972 review of the experiments by the American College of Radiology, which 
cleared Saenger of any wrongdoing and urged continued government support for 
his studies, acknowledged that subjects were not asked to sign consent forms 
until 1965 -- five years into the experiment. The radiology college said that 
only "in the last few years (patients) were told that the information might 
have military as well as clinical significance." 
</P>
<P>
 Commenting on the cross-section of subjects used in the experiment, the 
college review noted that "in both race and IQ, the group was representative of 
the patients served at Cincinnati General Hospital" -- the public hospital from 
which subjects for the experiments were drawn. 
</P>
<P>
 But the government's review is certain to concentrate as well on the propriety 
of exposing subjects -- even those considered to be terminally ill -- to 
radiation in a form and at a rate that apparently never had been tried on 
humans in experimental settings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although whole-body radiation was once seen as a potential treatment for 
leukemia, a textbook on the treatment of the disease that was in wide use at 
the time of Saenger's experiments warned that doses of no more than 25 rads 
should be given "to avoid too-great bone-marrow injury or other reactions." 
</P>
<P>
 Saenger wrote in a 1970 report of his work that subjects would be exposed to 
250 rads in one session at intensive dose rates of between three and six rads 
per minute. 
</P>
<P>
 "During that period, it was pretty well understood by health physicists that 
doses at that level would give a high risk of being fatal to a patient," Dr. 
Karl Z. Morgan, president emeritus of the International Radiation Protection 
Assn. and former president of the Health Physics Society, told The Times. "At 
250 rads, a number of persons would not survive that exposure and it certainly 
would hurry the death of someone with leukemia or a similar malignancy." 
</P>
<P>
 The dose led the Junior Faculty Assn. to suggest that bone marrow failure 
caused by excessive radiation exposure -- and not the normal course of their 
diseases -- may have led prematurely to the deaths of many of Saenger's 
experimental subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 Saenger's work, however, was considered important to the U.S. military, and 
Saenger frequently cast it as crucial to the study of nuclear defenses. In 
1963, Saenger reported to the Pentagon that "combat effectiveness would be 
relatively maintained at an exposure up to 200 rads" -- a dose in some cases 
lower than he was administering to ill patients. But he warned that "a second 
exposure would result in significant troop ineffectiveness." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys active in pursuing radiation compensation cases said experts such as 
Saenger frequently serve as key government witnesses in cases brought against 
the Energy Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Saenger is listed as a prospective government witness in six lawsuits being 
brought on behalf of 216 contract employees who worked on the construction of 
nuclear test sites during the 1950s and '60s. Attorneys said the government's 
treatment of the cases will be the first test of the Energy Department's 
commitment to the new standards it has espoused. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it a little hard to believe that Dr. Saenger could be that concerned 
about radiation effects when he could conduct experiments like these on 
humans," said Larry Johns, a Las Vegas attorney handling some of the pending 
suits. "It raises a question as to his objectivity. You have to wonder . . . 
how reliable, how credible are the experts the government brings in to testify 
in cases of this type?" Johns said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johns said that two other scientists whose work is now under review by the 
Energy Department are also on a list of prospective witnesses the government 
has furnished him. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the Energy Department to be able to use any testimony generated by what 
might be considered illicit experiments is insidious in its nature," said 
Stanley Chesley, a Cincinnati attorney active in pursuing nuclear radiation 
cases. "To use any of these experts to defend any of these cases is very 
disconcerting." Chesley declined to comment on the Saenger experiments.

WILSON LACKS VISION, BROWN, GARAMENDI SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The two Democratic contenders for Gov. Pete Wilson's job in 1994 accused the 
Republican chief executive Wednesday of failing to provide California with the 
vision, leadership and broad scope of solutions needed to make the state safe 
and prosperous. 
</P>
<P>
 In delivering the official Democratic Party response to Wilson's State of the 
State address, State Treasurer Kathleen Brown and Insurance Commissioner John 
Garamendi faulted Wilson more for what he failed to say than for the proposals 
he actually made. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Garamendi said California can use the talent and expertise of its 
declining defense industry to develop a new multibillion-dollar transportation 
manufacturing program in the state, making trolleys, subway cars and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's going to take a different kind of leader than we have today," 
Garamendi said during a side-by-side television appearance with Brown, whom he 
will face in the June primary for the Democratic nomination for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown faulted Wilson for neglecting to address education in his speech and 
urged Californians to make their own assessment of how the state is doing under 
Wilson, who is expected to have no major opposition in the GOP primary. She 
asked rhetorically: 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you feel safer than you did three years ago? Are your children's schools 
better? Do you feel more secure about your families' economic futures and are 
you getting more from your hard-earned tax dollar?" 
</P>
<P>
 Answering for herself, Brown said, "I think these last three years left too 
many people out of work, too many criminals out of jail and too many 
Californians out of hope." 
</P>
<P>
 The real political battle of the next five months will be between Brown and 
Garamendi as they fight for the party's selection as the candidate to challenge 
Wilson's reelection to a second term. Brown and Garamendi already have sparred 
sharply over which one has the best ideas, the most experience and leadership 
qualities. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, however, they treated each other as friends and allies in the 
greater political fight facing Democrats in the summer and fall -- unseating a 
governor whose popularity has plummeted as California's problems mounted, yet 
is recognized as a veteran, tough political campaigner. 
</P>
<P>
 By packaging Brown and Garamendi for the response, the Democratic Party sought 
to frame the State of the State as a campaign event. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, in contrast, presented the speech as about the chores of government 
rather than the hostilities of electoral politics. He struck a tone of 
conciliation, reaching out to Democrats to work with him during the coming 
session. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Wilson projected a political message to viewers around the 
state: That he's been toiling hard on their behalf and should be entrusted with 
another four years in office. 
</P>
<P>
 A Wilson spokesman, Dan Schnur, said the State of the State address was not 
meant as a vehicle for laying out Wilson's entire campaign more than a month 
before his official announcement, but that the twin themes of economy and crime 
will be heard frequently in the months ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two issues that he talked about tonight, jobs and crime, are issues that 
are foremost in the minds of the voters and in all likelihood will be foremost 
in the campaign." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, however, the governor was attempting to persuade voters that 
California is on the way back from the depths of the recession that helped make 
Wilson the most unpopular governor in recent California history midway through 
his first term. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message is that we are making it through," Schnur said. "We are headed in 
the right direction. There is a difficult road ahead, but we will make it 
through." 
</P>
<P>
 Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) said Democrats are in a strong 
position for an assault on Wilson's governorship. He said Kathleen Brown sounds 
tougher than Wilson on the crime issue and that Garamendi has projected a more 
comprehensive, coherent view than Wilson of what California needs to build for 
the future. 
</P>
<P>
 For the statewide television audience, both Brown and Garamendi sought to 
project sober reflection to appear gubernatorial. But in interviews with 
reporters, both were more sharply critical of the governor. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of very old, tired cliches" in Wilson's speech, Garamendi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the two of us is going to be the Democratic candidate and I think, in 
all honesty, one of us is going to be the next governor. We're going to 
challenge Pete Wilson." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said it was a major omission for the governor not to address the 
problems facing public education in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issues of crime and the economy are paramount. . . . But we will never 
deal with the crime situation and the economy unless we deal with education and 
how we will have the high-skilled jobs and how we will have the high-wage jobs 
to truly move us forward into the 21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
 In speeches throughout Northern California this week, Garamendi also talked 
about how the issues of crime and the economy are interconnected with improving 
the education system, job training, restoring the state's manufacturing base, 
and putting new emphasis on research and development. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi also said far more must be done to solve crime than just locking 
criminals away for longer periods of time in more new prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 Both he and Brown called for creation of "boot camps" to house first 
offenders, drug prevention and drug rehabilitation programs in an effort to 
break the cycle of crime. Job opportunities are critical to the process, they 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown took a shot at Wilson's proposed tax cut by saying that his speech 
consisted of "election year rhetoric from an election year governor who raised 
taxes more than any governor in the history of California."

CLINTONS TO DELIVER FILES ON LAND DEAL TO INVESTIGATORS; PROBE: FIRST FAMILY'S 
ACTION IS TIED TO GRAND JURY SUBPOENA THAT WILL HELP KEEP THE PAPERS PRIVATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER and RONALD J. OSTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton's personal lawyer today will begin giving federal 
investigators records of the First Family's Whitewater Development Corp. 
investment after a grand jury subpoena was issued, the White House said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The subpoena, issued Dec. 24 and disclosed in a White House statement 
Wednesday night, directs that the documents be surrendered to the Justice 
Department by Jan. 18. The White House said it would comply. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce R. Lindsey, senior adviser to Clinton, said in the statement that the 
subpoena was issued at the request of the Clintons' lawyer, David E. Kendall, 
who sought the order "to assure the integrity of the documents and the privacy 
of the process." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the subpoena, the papers may only be viewed by Justice Department 
officials and are less likely to be made public. 
</P>
<P>
 It also has the effect of impeding access to the documents by Republicans in 
Congress who are trying to conduct an independent inquiry, Republican sources 
in Congress charged Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department is investigating the Clintons' investment in an Ozark 
Mountains vacation property development known as Whitewater to determine 
whether funds were improperly diverted to the project from Madison Guaranty 
Savings & Loan, a failed thrift run by James B. McDougal, the Clintons' partner 
in the Whitewater deal. 
</P>
<P>
 The five boxes of records to be delivered to the Justice Department include 
papers relating to Whitewater removed from the office of former deputy White 
House counsel Vincent Foster, who committed suicide last July 20. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House agreed two weeks ago to surrender the Foster papers but until 
Wednesday had not said when it would do so. 
</P>
<P>
 With attention to the real estate deal growing, the way the matter is resolved 
could have a lasting effect on Clinton's presidency, his advisers and critics 
agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 What had appeared to be benign and small-scale financial dealings while 
Clinton was governor of Arkansas are now being cast in terms of scandal with a 
grand jury subpoena, demands for a special prosecutor and calls for 
congressional hearings unless the White House can provide persuasive answers to 
dozens of questions. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials -- from the Clintons on down -- have said they believe 
that continuing interest in the matter is driven by partisan politics. They 
have insisted that allegations of financial wrongdoing, conflicts of interest 
and gross cronyism are groundless. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nothing but a Republican witch hunt," said White House political adviser 
Paul Begala. 
</P>
<P>
 But Leonard Garment -- who had extensive experience with scandal as a White 
House lawyer under former President Richard Nixon -- said the Whitewater matter 
could be a continuing migraine for the President and First Lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton. In the lingo of Washington journalism, the Whitewater story has "legs" 
-- or staying power, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Whitewater affair potentially has legs, arms -- and very sharp teeth," he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 What is driving the Whitewater story are unanswered questions about the way 
the Clintons conducted their public and private business dealings. Here is an 
abbreviated rundown: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How much did the Clintons invest in the Whitewater real estate deal and how 
much did they gain or lose? 
</P>
<P>
 According to official accounts from the Clintons, they invested $68,900 in 
Whitewater beginning in 1978 while McDougal and his wife, Susan, put up 
$92,000. Despite the unequal shares, the partnership was structured as a 50-50 
split. Why? 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons have said they were merely "passive investors" in Whitewater who 
gave McDougal "total control" over the operation. They said they have no 
records of their investment or any profit or loss from it. Why not? 
</P>
<P>
 The investment raises several additional questions: Did the Clintons really 
put up their share of the partnership funds or were the funds a loan or gift 
from McDougal and his wife? If the Clintons did invest the money in Whitewater, 
where is the documentation? 
</P>
<P>
 Whitewater failed to file income taxes for three years in the 1980s and the 
impact on the Clintons' tax returns is unclear. Were the Clintons' finances and 
tax returns properly handled in those years? 
</P>
<P>
 There are also questions about the relationship between Madison Guaranty and 
Whitewater that may be covered by the records of the two entities, some of 
which are now in the hands of the Justice Department. Others have not been 
located. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal said he delivered all the Whitewater records to the Arkansas 
governor's mansion in 1987, but the Clintons deny that they ever received them. 
There are allegations that some Whitewater land sales were sham transactions to 
hide contributions to Clinton's gubernatorial campaign and that Madison 
Guaranty funds were diverted to Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators also want to know about the alleged diversion of $110,000 in 
proceeds from a Small Business Administration-backed loan to buy land for the 
Whitewater development. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Were the Clintons, through their investment, parties to mismanagement of a 
federally insured thrift? 
</P>
<P>
 Madison Guaranty -- owned by their friend, political contributor and 
investment partner McDougal -- grew from an institution with assets of $6 
million to a $107-million thrift in a three-year period in the early 1980s. 
Despite warning signs that the S&L was making questionable loans to insiders 
and numerous Clinton political associates, authorities did not close the bank 
until four years later. 
</P>
<P>
 A state securities commissioner appointed by Clinton approved a plan to 
recapitalize Madison Guaranty, which at the time was represented by Hillary 
Clinton and her partners at a Little Rock law firm. The thrift finally was 
shuttered in 1989, at a cost to taxpayers of at least $47.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Was Clinton aware of the thrift's problems and did the institution receive 
favorable regulatory treatment while he was governor? Who profited from the 
long delay in closing it? 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the loans that went into default were made to people with close ties 
to the Clintons -- including current Gov. Jim Guy Tucker and Seth Ward, the 
father-in-law of Webster Hubbell, a former law partner of Hillary Clinton and 
now the No. 3 official at the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Madison Guaranty executives staged a fund-raiser in early 1985 to help Clinton 
retire $50,000 in debts from his 1984 gubernatorial campaign. Did the bank or 
its officers provide any other money for Clinton campaigns before or after 
1985? Did the bank do any personal favors for the Clintons? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Have the Clintons dealt forthrightly with questions about the matter? Have 
they or their associates in any way interfered with the inquiries? 
</P>
<P>
 Suspicions about suppression of evidence arose last month when it was revealed 
that Whitewater-related files were secretly removed from the office of Foster 
and deposited with the Clintons' personal attorney two days after Foster's 
suicide in July. 
</P>
<P>
 After initially resisting turning over the files to the Justice Department for 
its inquiries into McDougal's business dealings and the death of Foster, 
Clinton relented just before Christmas and agreed to give up the records. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a question about whether there are additional relevant documents 
in the files of the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, where Hillary Clinton, 
Hubbell and Foster all worked together throughout the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 All three reportedly performed legal chores for McDougal and Madison Guaranty, 
but only the Foster files have turned up and it is not known how complete they 
are. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Was the initial investigation of Whitewater/Madison Guaranty delayed for 
political reasons and is the case being fairly investigated by the Clinton 
Justice Department? 
</P>
<P>
 Former Atty. Gen. William P. Barr, who served under former President George 
Bush, said Wednesday he believes that the U.S. attorney's office in Little Rock 
concealed from him in the fall of 1992 the existence of a Resolution Trust 
Corp. referral to the Justice Department seeking a criminal investigation of 
Madison Guaranty and Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 The delay could have aided then-candidate Clinton's campaign for the White 
House by deferring a criminal investigation in the final months of the 1992 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Barr said the Little Rock office failed to put the referral into two different 
reporting systems that would have brought the sensitive matter to his 
attention. He said he learned of the referral shortly before the November, 
1992, election. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also questions about the ability of the Justice Department under 
Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, a Clinton appointee, to conduct an impartial 
investigation of the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans in Congress have been pressing her to name an independent counsel 
to study the Whitewater affair. What Do the Investigators Want? 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department attorneys are investigating the failed Madison Guaranty 
Savings and Loan, headed by a former Clinton friend, business partner and 
political ally, James McDougal. Investigators are trying to determine whether 
depositors' funds were diverted to Clinton's 1984 gubernatorial campaign and to 
Whitewater Development Corp., a real estate venture once owned by the Clintons 
and McDougal. Clinton aides have said the President and First Lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton never knew the source of the campaign money and were inactive 
co-owners of what they say was a money-losing real estate deal. 
</P>
<P>
 SOME KEY QUESTIONS INVESTIGATORS ARE SEEKING TO ANSWER 
</P>
<P>
 * How much did the Clintons invest in the Whitewater deal and how much did 
they gain or lose from the investment? 
</P>
<P>
 * Were the Clintons, through their investment, actively party to the looting 
of a federally insured thrift? 
</P>
<P>
 * Was political influence used to benefit the land investment or delay 
exposure of wrongdoing at the failed savings and loan? Did Clinton's political 
organization benefit from the dealings? 
</P>
<P>
 * Have the Clintons dealt forthrightly with the questions about the matter? 
Have they or their allies in any way interfered with the inquiries into it?

COLUMN ONE; A LOTTERY WITH VERY HIGH STAKES; TWO FRIENDS UNITED BY MS ARE AMONG 
PATIENTS SEEKING A SCARCE BUT PROMISING NEW DRUG. SHARON DREW NO. 319, ALISON 
59,814. SUCH INEQUITIES FRUSTRATE BOTH THE LUCKY ONES AND THOSE WHO CAN ONLY 
WAIT AND HOPE. 
</P>

By SHERYL STOLBERG, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They are sisters in spirit, Sharon Fuhrman and Alison Caldow. They guard one 
another's fears and secrets, finish one another's sentences. They giggle at 
quirky British television shows, grow melancholy at poignant ballads and share 
a zest for what Sharon calls "artsy, intellectual kind of stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 But common likes and dislikes are not what brought these women together. 
Sadly, their friendship is rooted in a crippling disease -- multiple sclerosis 
-- that is slowly stripping them of control over their bodies and minds. 
Already, MS has pushed Sharon into a wheelchair. It takes all of Alison's 
strength just to walk. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, fate binds them in another way: the lottery. 
</P>
<P>
 This was no ordinary lottery, nothing as simple as spinning the Fantasy Five 
or as serendipitous as a quick pick from the computer at 7-Eleven. No, this was 
a gamble with much higher stakes, a drawing for a brand-new drug -- the first 
new treatment for multiple sclerosis in a quarter-century, and the first ever 
to attack the disease itself, rather than simply easing its symptoms. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug is called Betaseron. It is not a miracle worker. It won't cure 
multiple sclerosis. It won't reverse damage already done. But it does seem to 
keep MS patients from getting worse -- something no other medicine has done. 
</P>
<P>
 But Betaseron is expensive -- $10,000 a year -- and the government-funded 
Medicare program, as well as some private health insurance plans, won't cover 
it. More critically at the moment, there is not enough of it to go around. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the lottery, run by Berlex Laboratories, a Richmond, Calif.-based 
company that created Betaseron. The rules were simple: The first 12,000 would 
get the drug right away, and another 55,000 would wait until more supplies 
become available. 
</P>
<P>
 The results came back a couple of months ago, and the close friends could not 
have been further apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon's number is 319. She started taking Betaseron the week before 
Christmas. Alison drew 59,814; she must wait at least until mid-1995. Kismet 
had dealt these women a bittersweet hand, and the lucky one found herself 
grieving. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt so bad for her," Sharon says. "I know how much it means to her to stop 
this thing while she can still walk. Every time she gets a new twinge, I hurt 
for her. I remember when I went from her stage to this stage, and I hate to see 
that happen to her. I almost at one point thought maybe it would be better if 
she got it. But I can't fix that." 
</P>
<P>
 If Alison is jealous or disappointed, she refuses to show it. "Just because I 
have a high number I am not going to give up my positive attitude," she 
insists. "Life goes on. It went on before Betaseron. It will go on after it. . 
. . I just feel for the person who has a higher number than I do, and who needs 
it more." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The story of these women, who befriended one another through a support group 
in the Southern California high desert town of Hesperia, illustrates the plight 
of thousands of multiple sclerosis patients across America who are pinning 
their dreams on a drug that, either because of high cost or limited supply, is 
tantalizingly beyond their grasp. 
</P>
<P>
 One angry father organized a massive letter-writing campaign when his 
16-year-old son drew a number above 50,000; he is threatening to sue Berlex if 
the teen-ager doesn't get the drug by April. Says one tearful, frustrated 
patient: "They have produced this wonderful drug and are hanging it out in 
front of our noses, like a carrot in front of a donkey." 
</P>
<P>
 This is also the story of high-tech medicine, and how a pharmaceutical company 
poured 10 years into developing a drug that it now must price high enough for 
shareholders to see a return. Without dramatic advances in genetic engineering 
and the willingness of investors to risk hundreds of millions of dollars, 
Betaseron would never have been possible. Now, Berlex officials say, it is time 
to pay these people back. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an unreasonable mechanism for funding research," says Dr. Jeffrey 
Latts, the company's vice president for clinical research. "That's how it 
works." 
</P>
<P>
 And finally, it's the story of the nation's quirky, patchwork health care 
system -- a system fraught with loopholes. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlex is offering financial aid to low-income people who entered the lottery 
but lack insurance, and in some cases is even giving away Betaseron. But that 
doesn't help people who are insured but whose carriers won't cover the drug. 
(Sharon's does.) Medicaid, the federal insurance program for the poor, pays for 
Betaseron. Medicare, which provides coverage for an estimated 50,000 elderly 
and disabled MS patients -- including Alison -- does not. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason? Betaseron is taken by self-administered injection, in much the way 
diabetics give themselves insulin. That makes it an outpatient drug, and 
Medicare does not cover outpatient prescriptions. But if a doctor gave the 
shots, they would be covered. 
</P>
<P>
 "In truth, our big problem is the terrible, outrageous, abominable state of 
health insurance in this country," says Martha Keys, chief spokeswoman for the 
National Multiple Sclerosis Society. "This is why we so desperately need 
comprehensive health reform." 
</P>
<P>
 As a former congresswoman from Kansas, Keys once had a hand in shaping health 
policy. Now, she is on the other side of the fence, lobbying her former 
colleagues to make an exception to the Medicare rule about Betaseron. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just think about trying to get $10,000 out of your income next year," she 
says. "We have people who have called in and said, 'Look, I've increased the 
mortgage on my house so I can get Betaseron for a year, but what am I going to 
do after that?' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Betaseron means so much to people with multiple sclerosis because it is their 
greatest hope yet in battling an illness that strikes quietly, often slowly, 
but ultimately with devastation. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 350,000 Americans are afflicted with MS. It most often hits 
between the ages of 20 and 40, and strikes twice as many women as men. Sharon, 
who just turned 50, has had MS since she was 33. Alison, 36, received the 
diagnosis seven years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease is not considered fatal, but it is insidious, wearing the body 
down over time. Its symptoms are debilitating -- blindness, paralysis, bladder 
dysfunction, fatigue, loss of memory, slurred speech, muscle spasms -- and they 
vary greatly from patient to patient. 
</P>
<P>
 MS is like a thief. It has a ruthless way of robbing people of what they 
cherish most. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon once had a beautiful singing voice; as recently as three years ago, she 
had a job delivering singing telegrams. Now she speaks in a computer-like 
monotone, the words trickling out at an achingly slow pace. She is fond of 
baking, but following recipes is difficult; her mind can't accumulate 
information. She loved to write, especially letters, but she can't string 
sentences together quite the way she used to. 
</P>
<P>
 She misses being able to plan. She is a widow whose children are grown, and 
she had designs on moving north, to Washington, where the air is finer and the 
scenery prettier. Then reality hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what I'm going to be like in a year," she says. "If I can't take 
care of myself, what am I going to do way up there among strangers? You don't 
want to think the worst, but it would be nice to know what's in store. That's 
the trouble with this stupid disease. You can't plan." 
</P>
<P>
 At a glance, Alison looks healthier than Sharon. But appearances deceive. Her 
gait is unsteady; she must hold onto walls and furniture when she does not use 
her cane. Her hand quivers when she writes a check. She wears a size six shoe, 
but her sneakers are sevens; she buys them big so she can slip them on without 
having to fiddle with the laces. Her shirt is a pullover; like most people with 
MS, her fingers lack the dexterity for buttons. 
</P>
<P>
 Alison's passion was riding horseback, but multiple sclerosis forced her to 
give it up. She couldn't get up on her horse anymore, and she didn't have the 
energy to groom her. Recently, she sold the animal, a Morgan Arabian named 
Sable, to a rancher who planned to offer rides to disabled children. Thinking 
about it makes her cry. But her real regret is that she and her fiance will 
never have children; she says having a mother with MS would be too big a burden 
on a child. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grieve an awful lot," she says, wiping her eyes, "for things I have no 
control over." 
</P>
<P>
 Why she and Sharon are ill is a mystery. Nobody knows what causes multiple 
sclerosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with rheumatoid arthritis and lupus, MS is one of a series of 
"autoimmune disorders" in which the immune system runs amok, mistakenly 
attacking the body. In MS, the central nervous system -- the brain and spinal 
cord -- is the target. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease destroys myelin, the protective sheath surrounding nerve fibers 
that transmit messages to the body. Myelin works like insulation on an 
electrical wire. Without myelin, nerves short-circuit. Their messages get 
scrambled, and the brain can't tell the body what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 MS wreaks its havoc in sudden flare-ups, or "exacerbations" -- episodes in 
which the symptoms become excruciatingly severe. These attacks have no pattern; 
they may happen every three months or every three years. Alison had her last 
one in September. She woke up choking, unable to control her ability to 
swallow. 
</P>
<P>
 With each flare-up, patients lose a little more ground. They often talk 
wistfully about "coming back" from an attack, as though they have gone on a 
voyage and left a part of themselves behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I come back," Alison says, "there is always something different wrong 
with me. Prior to this one, predominantly my left side was affected. Now it is 
both the left and the right." 
</P>
<P>
 There are drugs on the market that ease the symptoms of MS, and most patients 
can rattle off their tongue-twister names: Baclofin for muscle tightness and 
spasms. Amantadine for fatigue. Pro-Banthine for bladder control. Carbamazepine 
for the burning, shooting pain that comes with MS. Methylprednesilone and other 
steroid treatments to make walking easier and relieve double vision. 
</P>
<P>
 But there has never been a drug that attacked MS directly, one that actually 
prevents exacerbations from occurring. Until Betaseron. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first drug ever that has changed the natural history of this 
disease," declares Dr. Kenneth Johnson, a University of Maryland neurologist 
who participated in the clinical trials of Betaseron. "This is very promising." 
</P>
<P>
 But the discovery did not happen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug is a genetically-engineered form of beta interferon, a naturally 
occurring protein that the immune system uses to fend off viruses. Because of 
its immune properties, scientists had high hopes for Betaseron. But they 
fumbled around for a decade before they figured out a good use for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlex tried the drug on just about everything -- on cancer of the kidney, 
colon, lung and brain, on hepatitis and on viral infections, as well as on 
multiple sclerosis. There have been 75 clinical studies of the drug. All 
flopped except two -- the ones involving MS patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of people who were very frustrated by the process," says 
Latts, the company's director of clinical research. "These products don't come 
out of the laboratory with a sign on them saying, 'This is good for multiple 
sclerosis.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, after a small pilot study, Berlex began testing Betaseron on 372 MS 
patients in the United States and Canada. All were still walking, and all 
suffered from "relapsing remitting" as opposed to "chronic progressive MS," an 
extremely disabling, late stage of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The results were impressive but not overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients who got the drug had 35% fewer attacks than those who got a placebo 
and half as many serious exacerbations. But what Johnson and other neurologists 
found particularly compelling were the magnetic resonance images of the 
subjects' brains. 
</P>
<P>
 MRI scans of placebo patients showed a 20% increase in damaged myelin. 
Patients who got Betaseron showed no new damage at all. "That is the promise of 
this drug," Johnson says, "that it is going to make a difference in the 
accumulating neurological damage, in the need for canes and wheelchairs." 
</P>
<P>
 There were some troubling findings as well. The drug causes flu-like side 
effects and produces reactions, such as welts and swelling, where it is 
injected. Moreover, one person who got Betaseron committed suicide, and three 
more attempted to kill themselves. Experts say there is no way to assess 
whether Betaseron played a role; MS often makes patients depressed, yet there 
were no suicide attempts in the control group. 
</P>
<P>
 The positives about Betaseron clearly outweighed the negatives in the eyes of 
the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which approved Betaseron for multiple 
sclerosis in July. The approval, which Johnson and other experts believe was 
influenced heavily by the MRI test results, was unusually quick; FDA officials 
normally take up to three years to review new drug applications, but Betaseron 
was approved in just one year. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the good news. The bad news was that Berlex wasn't ready. 
</P>
<P>
 The company Berlex contracted to manufacture Betaseron, Chiron Corp. in 
Emeryville, Calif., had been making the drug in tiny quantities, just enough 
for experimental use. Now there was a huge demand, and Chiron -- which had 
planned to build new manufacturing facilities while the FDA took its time 
pondering Betaseron's approval -- couldn't meet it. 
</P>
<P>
 Berlex was in a quandary. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply putting the drug out on the market and letting people scramble for it 
would do no good; Betaseron must be taken every other day, and patients needed 
to be assured a continuous supply. Nor, Latts says, did company officials want 
to put themselves in the position of picking people who might benefit the most 
from Betaseron; that seemed a little too much like playing God, and in any 
event there is not enough research to support such a determination. 
</P>
<P>
 So they settled on the lottery -- a term the company dislikes, for it implies 
there are losers. The deadline for what Berlex has termed the "open 
registration" for Betaseron was Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Across America, nearly 67,000 people whose doctors believed they were good 
candidates for Betaseron registered with Berlex for the computerized drawing. 
And then the waiting began. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 In Hesperia, a fast-growing town on the road to Las Vegas, where Joshua trees 
and fast-food restaurants dot the landscape, the High Desert MS Support Group 
was watching closely. The group meets every other week for comfort and 
laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 There is Clint, a retired peace officer and the only Republican of the clan, 
who takes endless grief for being a Rush Limbaugh devotee. There is Deborah, a 
former athlete, and Michele, the group's founder. There is David, the "baby" of 
the group at age 25, who sometimes brings his mom to meetings. And Don, who 
arrived a year ago with a chip on his shoulder and now pointedly tells a 
visitor: "If you're looking for a bunch of people wallowing in self-pity, 
you've come to the wrong place." 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, Sharon and Alison. They are the bookends, the lowest and 
highest lottery numbers in the group. 
</P>
<P>
 They have come to grips with this disparity quite neatly, in a way that spares 
their friendship any pain. Sharon, they have decided, is "the guinea pig." All 
will be watching to see what this drug does for -- or to -- her. 
</P>
<P>
 After just three weeks of therapy, it is too soon to tell. While the friends 
are optimistic, they are realists as well. Years have passed with no new 
treatments for MS. During that time, they have watched themselves and the 
people they love deteriorate. In the back of their minds is a nagging fear that 
Betaseron might not live up to its promise. In the way that they have of 
finishing one another's sentences, they offer this summation: 
</P>
<P>
 "We all started out . . . " Sharon says, until Alison interjects: "A little 
more hopeful than we are right now." Making Progress 
</P>
<P>
 A new genetically-engineered drug, Betaseron, has been shown to slow the 
crippling effects of multiple sclerosis, a progressive disorder in which the 
immune system mistakenly attacks the body. Betaseron, expensive and in limited 
supply, is being distributed through a lottery system. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease 
</P>
<P>
 Multiple sclerosis targets the central nervous system -- the brain and spinal 
cord. The disease destroys the myelin sheath, the protective cover that 
surrounds the nerve fibers that send messages to the body. Without myelin, 
nerve fibers cannot send messages properly. Thus the brain of an MS patient 
cannot tell the body what to do, leaving MS patients with a host of 
debilitating symptoms, among them blindness, paralysis, memory loss, bladder 
dysfunction and slurred speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Betaseron 
</P>
<P>
 Betaseron apparently slows the destruction of the myelin sheath, although 
scientists are not sure why. Some think myelin is destroyed when the body makes 
an excess of gamma interferon, a naturally occurring protein that may prompt 
the immune system to attack the myelin sheath. 
</P>
<P>
 Another kind of interferon -- beta interferon -- stifles gamma interferon. 
Betaseron, a genetically engineered form of beta interferon, is thought to 
suppress the immune system attacks. The drug does not reverse damage already 
done by the disease but appears to keep MS patients from getting worse.

TIP O'NEILL DIES AT 81; FIVE-TERM SPEAKER OF HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL HOUSTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former House Speaker Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill Jr. (D-Mass.), the genial and 
shrewd Boston Irishman who came to be regarded as one of the most effective 
House leaders of the 20th Century, died Wednesday night. He was 81. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital said the cause of his 
death was cardiac arrest. Relatives told WCVB-TV in Boston that O'Neill went to 
the hospital Wednesday for a routine checkup and had the heart attack while 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Speaker had had cancer surgery in 1987 -- the same year he retired 
at the end of his 17th term in Congress and fifth term as Speaker -- and in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing of the death, the White House released a statement saying: "Mr. 
O'Neill was a great American who served his country with distinction for many 
decades. He leaves behind a proud legacy of public service. Our hearts go out 
to the family and friends of this fine man." 
</P>
<P>
 "Tip was a giant in every way, a giant of a man, a giant of a Speaker and a 
giant of a friend," said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.). "He never lost the 
common touch, and our state has lost one of the greatest public servants it 
ever had." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill, known as Tip since his boyhood, was a man of formidable physical 
presence with his unruly thatch of white hair, bulbous nose and bulky 6-foot, 
3-inch frame. Friends said he resembled a lumbering bear when he walked. With 
his deep voice, he also could sound like a bear when angered. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the most part, he was a man of easygoing charm who was devoted to 
poker, golf, cigars and good whiskey. And he was probably the single most 
popular man on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tip O'Neill has no enemies in this House," Rep. Sam Gibbons (D-Fla.) said 
after he ran against O'Neill for majority leader in 1972 but had to withdraw 
for lack of support. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for all his back-slapping geniality, O'Neill was a fiercely partisan 
Democrat. Franklin D. Roosevelt was his great hero and O'Neill remained a loyal 
New Deal disciple even when his brand of liberalism seemed to be going out of 
vogue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been one of the big spenders of all time," O'Neill said without apology 
in 1981, when President Ronald Reagan's new conservative Administration was at 
the height of its popularity and was waging a crusade against big government 
and big spenders. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill was an unabashed champion of big government and would argue 
passionately that government has a responsibility to care for the unfortunate 
and to spend billions for health, education, welfare, transportation, the 
environment and consumer protection. 
</P>
<P>
 This naturally put him on a collision course with Reagan, and they warred 
incessantly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Speaker once called Reagan "the least knowledgeable of any President I've 
ever met, on any subject. He works by three-by-five cards." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet on personal terms, the two men -- both gregarious Irishmen with a penchant 
for storytelling -- got along famously and spent many an hour swapping yarns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a tremendous liking for him," O'Neill said of Reagan in 1981 to Boston 
friends. "You people would like him, too. He's got the charm; he's got the 
grace; he's got the humor. And he's kicking the hell out of me." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Reagan praised O'Neill as "one of our nation's most 
distinguished legislators," and remembered their battles almost fondly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is no secret that Tip and I often had differing political views," Reagan 
said. "But as Tip once said during one of our fierce political battles: Don't 
worry, when 5 o'clock rolls around, we'll put business aside and just be 
friends. I must confess that on more than one occasion, Tip and I found 
ourselves turning our watches ahead to the 5 o'clock hour." 
</P>
<P>
 Reagan's first two years as President were probably the worst period of 
O'Neill's life. His House Democrats suffered a net loss of 33 seats in Reagan's 
1980 election landslide and, combined with the defection of many "boll weevil" 
Southern Democrats, the loss gave Reagan a conservative majority on key fiscal 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981, O'Neill's beleaguered troops were steamrolled as Reagan's supporters 
rammed through sweeping domestic budget and tax cuts. O'Neill protested, 
forcefully and sadly, but to no avail. Republican campaigners took to 
ridiculing him as a symbol of all that was wrong with what they called big 
government run amok. 
</P>
<P>
 One particularly acid-tongued young Republican described O'Neill as "big, fat 
and out of control -- just like the federal government." (To O'Neill's delight, 
that young congressman, John LeBoutillier of New York, was defeated for 
reelection in 1982.) 
</P>
<P>
 Even some House Democrats, smarting from repeated defeats in 1981, began 
muttering that perhaps O'Neill had outlasted his usefulness. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Les Aspin, an outspoken Wisconsin liberal, said in a newsletter to 
constituents that O'Neill was "in a fog" and had "no idea where to go." 
</P>
<P>
 A Boston Globe reporter wrote of O'Neill at the time: "Underneath his thin 
political skin there is the occasional look of a wounded caribou facing 
wolves." 
</P>
<P>
 Then things changed. In 1982, with voters blaming Reagan and the Republicans 
for the nation's staggering unemployment rate and the worst economic times 
since the Great Depression, the Democrats emerged from the elections with a net 
gain of 26 House seats. O'Neill won a good deal of credit, justified or not, 
because he had been in the forefront of those denouncing Reagan's economic 
policies as being unfair to the poor and overly generous to the prosperous. 
</P>
<P>
 The election gave O'Neill a working majority again and his Democrats, although 
unable to reverse the Reagan tide, could at least avoid further humiliations. 
Of equal satisfaction to O'Neill was that criticism of his performance turned 
once again to praise. 
</P>
<P>
 A thoroughgoing political animal, O'Neill was never much interested in the 
details of legislation. His interest was in passing his party's legislative 
program and in demonstrating his mastery of the mystique of leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 He displayed his deftness almost immediately when he was first elected Speaker 
in January, 1977. Jimmy Carter had been elected President, ending eight years 
of Republican administrations, and he promptly presented Congress with an 
extraordinarily ambitious legislative program. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, the ascetic and introverted Georgia outsider, and O'Neill, the 
ebullient Boston pol, did not operate on the same wavelength and had frequent 
differences. But Carter, after all, was a Democrat and O'Neill, a loyal party 
man, was determined to do everything in his power to enact Carter's program. 
</P>
<P>
 He did remarkably well, particularly on Carter's highly complex and 
controversial energy proposals. Displaying his genius for legislative timing 
and parliamentary resourcefulness, O'Neill created a special ad hoc energy 
committee and superimposed it over the regular legislative panels that 
constantly warred with each other over jurisdictional turf. 
</P>
<P>
 The special committee, packed with O'Neill allies, sent to the House floor a 
bill that was much closer to what Carter had requested than the regular 
committees would have produced separately. Furthermore, the package went to the 
full House almost within O'Neill's deadline of three months. The Senate, in 
contrast, took more than a year to dispose of its version of the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with other accomplishments, O'Neill's stewardship of the energy issue, 
engineered through a skillful blend of soft and hardball tactics, soon caused 
his colleagues and outside observers to rate him as the most effective Speaker 
since the late Democrat Sam Rayburn of Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill was married to the former Mildred Ann Miller. They had five children. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Philip O'Neill Jr. was born Dec. 9, 1912, in a solidly Irish-American 
neighborhood of North Cambridge, Mass., where he early on developed a love for 
Democratic politics. His father, Thomas Sr., son of an Irish immigrant, was a 
bricklayer and later became head of the city's patronage-rich water system. 
</P>
<P>
 By age 15, young O'Neill was a practiced campaign worker and helped ring 
doorbells to get out the vote in Democrat Al Smith's unsuccessful 1928 
presidential campaign against Herbert Hoover. 
</P>
<P>
 He won a seat in the Republican-dominated state Legislature in 1936. In 1949, 
at age 37, he became the youngest Speaker of the Massachusetts House and the 
first Democratic Speaker since the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 He was elected to the U.S. House in 1952.O'NEILL, THOMAS P (

GOVERNOR CALLS FOR MORE JOBS AND PRISONS, TAX REDUCTIONS; CALIFORNIA: WILSON 
SAYS FAMILIES EARNING UNDER $40,000, SOME FIRMS SHOULD GET BREAKS. HE TERMS NEW 
JOBS AND CRIME REDUCTION 'TWIN PILLARS OF THE FUTURE.' 
</P>

<P>
 Citing job creation and crime reduction as the "twin pillars" on which he 
hopes to build California's future, Gov. Pete Wilson on Wednesday proposed 
rewarding businesses that hire new workers and punishing more harshly violent 
criminals who repeatedly break the law. 
</P>
<P>
 In an election-year State of the State Address to a joint session of the 
Legislature, the Republican governor returned to two themes that helped him win 
the state's highest office in 1990: taxes and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson proposed a $50 tax credit for families earning less than $40,000 a 
year. He called for putting more police on the street by hiring 500 new Highway 
Patrol officers and assigning them to local communities, and he said the state 
should construct six new prisons to hold more criminals serving longer 
sentences than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor did not say how the cash-strapped state government could afford 
to cut taxes and boost anti-crime spending at the same time, and Democratic 
legislative leaders, reacting to the speech, accused him of making 
election-year promises that he knows he cannot keep. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's speech made almost no mention of education -- always a top issue in 
the state -- and only a passing reference to illegal immigration, a topic the 
governor hammered at time and again during the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Combining a pointed attack on federal policy-makers with a conciliatory call 
for bipartisan action on state problems, Wilson urged lawmakers to build on a 
year of cooperative efforts in which he and the Legislature enacted a package 
of bills intended to make California a better place in which to do business. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor put further behind him his negative rhetoric of 1992, when he 
complained in his State of the State speech that California had "lost much of 
its competitive edge" and warned that the changes he wanted would "cause 
discomfort." The only discomfort he promised in this speech was for the state's 
criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson linked his two key issues by insisting that companies will not build 
new plants or expand existing ones in a state where their customers and workers 
do not feel secure in their homes or on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "New jobs and safe streets are the twin pillars on which we must build 
California's future," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's fourth State of the State speech was received politely in the ornate 
Assembly chamber dominated by Democrats. His 30-minute address was interrupted 
15 times by applause. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two Democrats who are vying to oppose Wilson in the fall -- state 
Treasurer Kathleen Brown and Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi -- said they 
doubted his ability to provide the leadership needed to get the job done. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can get California moving forward again, but it's going to take common 
sense, hard work and, above all, realistic solutions," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi said Wilson has had three years to turn the state around but has 
failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, we've been on the wrong track," he said. "He's had three 
swings at the bat, and in baseball, when you miss three times, you're out." 
</P>
<P>
 Legislative leaders said Wilson's speech was unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate President Pro Tem David A. Roberti of Van Nuys said Wilson was in a 
"campaign mode," cynically promising to boost public safety funding while 
cutting taxes, a pledge Roberti said the governor cannot keep. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was plainly an election-year speech," Roberti said. 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic Assemblyman John Vasconcellos of Santa Clara, the Assembly's lead 
budget writer, called Wilson's speech "an embarrassment" because it seemed 
calculated to appeal to voters at the expense of fiscal responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just does not add up," Vasconcellos said. "I am against crime and for new 
jobs too. But we also have a constitutional obligation to balance the budget." 
</P>
<P>
 But Assembly Republican Leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga called it a 
"good speech" that could set the tone for another harmonious legislative 
session. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Democrats will cooperate as they did last year, we will have a very 
productive session and California will become safer as well," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor proposed a $1,000 tax credit for each job, up to 100, created in 
any start-up small businesses over the next two years. And his proposed $50 tax 
credit would amount to an 18% tax cut for the average couple earning less than 
$40,000. Last year, at Wilson's insistence, the state suspended the renters tax 
credit, which granted credits of up to $120 for tenants in the same income 
group that Wilson says he now wants to help. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's aides said the governor's proposed tax cuts would cost about $140 
million -- in a general fund budget of about $40 billion. A tax cut for 
lower-income wage earners, while affecting a large number of people, is 
relatively inexpensive for the state because people in that income group do not 
pay very much in taxes to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said he might seek more tax cuts as the year progresses. 
</P>
<P>
 "California must go further in making our tax structure competitive," Wilson 
said. "Taxes are a cost of doing business. States that tax less than California 
are clearly more attractive on that score." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also called for reduced regulations and paperwork and a doubling of the 
state's export finance program. He repeated his call to abolish the state 
Energy Commission, added the Integrated Waste Management Board to his hit list 
and suggested that the state trim middle management jobs by 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson complained that the state's efforts often are thwarted by the federal 
government. Every time the state takes a step forward, a "giant push back" 
comes from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just that further defense cuts are idling aerospace workers," Wilson 
said. "Federal water cuts are squeezing our farmers. A failed immigration 
policy is busting our budget. And higher federal taxes are pinching our 
wallets." 
</P>
<P>
 On crime, Wilson said the state needs to focus on three points: more police on 
the street, improved programs to keep children from turning to crime and 
stiffer sentences for violent offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 He made two references to Polly Klaas, the 12-year-old Petaluma girl who was 
kidnaped from her home and murdered, and to Richard Allen Davis, the repeat 
felon who has confessed to the crime. Wilson called Davis an "animal" who 
should never have been released from prison. Marc Klaas, Polly's father, 
watched from the gallery at Wilson's invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite calling for a greater effort to keep children from becoming criminals, 
Wilson said the state must deal strictly with those who do stray. Children as 
young as 14 who commit violent crimes, he said, should be tried as adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sympathize with those neglected children who are tempted by drugs or 
gangs," Wilson said. "But when as teen-agers or adults they victimize others, 
our sympathy must yield to responsibility. And our first responsibility must be 
always to protect the innocent and punish the guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Wilson said, more than 400 children were murdered in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our streets are stained with the blood of our children, and it's got to 
stop," Wilson said, his voice rising. "Damn it, it's got to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson proposed hiring 500 new California Highway Patrol officers and 
assigning them to high-crime communities to help local police. He cited a 
special program in the city of East Palo Alto where a regional crime-fighting 
effort reduced the murder rate by 86%. 
</P>
<P>
 "Swift response and united community worked in East Palo Alto, and it can work 
around our state to reduce the fears felt by too many Californians," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also repeated his call for adoption of the "three strikes" measure to 
lock up three-time violent felons for life. If the Legislature does not pass 
the measure, he said, the voters will enact the proposal as a ballot 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 For certain arsonists and sexual offenders, Wilson said, the punishment should 
be even swifter: life in prison for the first offense. Repeat felons caught 
with a gun should face the same fate, he said. Credits allowing prisoners to 
cut their sentences in half by working and behaving well while behind bars 
should be curtailed, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to turn career criminals into career inmates," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor said the state should build six new prisons -- adding to the 26 
already housing more than 110,000 inmates -- financed by a $2-billion bond 
measure that he wants to put before the voters later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson acknowledged that the anti-crime effort would be expensive. He said he 
would rather spend the money on universities than prisons. But the state, he 
said, has no choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does anyone want to tell me how much a child's life is worth? Does anyone 
want to assign a dollar value to the lives of 400 murdered children?" Wilson 
asked. Then he added: "We can -- and we must -- prevent these crimes by 
building the prisons we need to put violent criminals away." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson made few attempts at soaring rhetoric and outlined no expansive vision 
for the state's future, as he did in his first State of the State speech in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Californians, he said, are less concerned about the coming century than "about 
the security of their job today and the safety of their family tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 But neither did Wilson lay down a controversial agenda like the one he 
proposed in 1992, when he waged confrontational, partisan conflict with the 
Democrats in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 An adviser agreed that Wilson's address was high on practical proposals and 
short on memorable flourishes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a no-frills, nuts-and-bolts kind of speech," said Dan Schnur, Wilson's 
campaign spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Jerry Gillam and Carl Ingram contributed to this story. 
State of the State Speech 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson's State of the State Address was received with skepticism by 
a Legislature dominated by Democrats. State Treasurer Kathleen Brown and 
Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, both vying to replace him, later 
delivered their responses. 
</P>
<P>
 THE SPEECH 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson: "New jobs and safe streets are the twin pillars on which we 
must build California's future." 
</P>
<P>
 THE REACTION 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Brown: "Wilson should ave spoken about the state's education needs. 
The issues of crime and the economy are paramount. But education fits into 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 John Garamendi: "It was basically the same type of old rhetoric: We're going 
to fight crime and cut taxes." Wilson's Major New Proposals 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the major new proposals Gov. Pete Wilson made Wednesday in his State 
of the State Address: 
</P>
<P>
 * An 18% income tax cut for Californians earning less than $40,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hiring 500 new California Highway Patrol officers and assigning them to help 
local police in high-crime communities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Building six new state prisons, paid for with a $2-billion bond measure to 
be put before the voters later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * A $1,000 tax credit for each new job created by start-up small businesses 
during a two-year period.

COMMUNITY AT HEART OF NEW LAPD PROGRAM; SAFETY: NEIGHBORHOOD-BASED STRATEGY 
ANNOUNCED AT SITE WHERE RIOTERS ROUTED POLICE. AREA HAS 750,000 RESIDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Charged with fighting crime in one of the nation's most violent areas, Los 
Angeles Police Deputy Chief Mark A. Kroeker on Wednesday unveiled the LAPD's 
most ambitious effort to adopt a community-oriented style of policing. 
</P>
<P>
 Kroeker announced the change at the site of one of the LAPD's most notorious 
failures, the intersection of Florence and Normandie avenues, where rioters 
overwhelmed the Police Department in the early stages of the 1992 unrest. 
Kroeker, a popular deputy chief whose community outreach efforts won him an 
intensely loyal following in the San Fernando Valley, called the intersection a 
symbol of negativity but vowed that the new policing effort will help erase 
that legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had so much negativity," said Kroeker, who was transferred from the 
Valley to the LAPD's South Bureau in November. "Now it's time for some 
positivity." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Kroeker's approach, 30 experienced officers who previously responded to 
radio calls now are responsible for overseeing community policing in an area 
that has 750,000 residents and has broken its own homicide records in each of 
the past three years. The officers, formally known as "senior lead officers," 
have all been assigned separate neighborhoods within the area, which extends 
from the Santa Monica Freeway to the southern edge of the city. Those officers 
are responsible for coordinating the department's activities in their 
designated communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with the lead officers will be a network of civilian block captains 
and community representatives, whose responsibilities will be to inform the 
police of problems in their neighborhoods and to advise officers on how 
residents would like to see those problems solved. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD has dabbled with community-based policing for decades, and since the 
arrival of Police Chief Willie L. Williams in 1992 it has experimented with 
various programs in different parts of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kroeker's campaign is the broadest and in some ways the riskiest. It has 
the backing of Williams and many other city leaders, but they acknowledge that, 
at least in the short term, response time to emergency calls may increase -- a 
potentially perilous problem in an area overwhelmed by emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're concerned that the response time may go up a little bit," Kroeker said. 
"We'll be watching that closely." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kroeker and other supporters of community-based policing believe the 
approach ultimately will reduce crime by involving citizens in the activities 
of the LAPD. Moreover, Kroeker said he thinks community-based policing also 
will cause complaints against officers to decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who happened by the site of Wednesday's news conference cheered many 
of Kroeker's proposals, but their skepticism about the Police Department runs 
deep and their optimism is guarded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trust has to be rebuilt, and that's not going to be easy," said Fernando 
Pullum, a resident who works at a local high school. "They have their work cut 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 Georgiana Williams -- whose son, Damian Monroe Williams, is in prison for the 
beating of trucker Reginald O. Denny and other people during the riots -- lives 
just a block away from Florence and Normandie. She missed Kroeker's 
announcement but said later that she hopes his community-based policing model 
succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sick and tired of young men being harassed," she said. "You have to give 
the police the chance to do something else. You have no choice." 
</P>
<P>
 A few residents also grumbled that Kroeker had failed to invite community 
residents to his news conference Wednesday. "I didn't hear nothing about it," 
one man shouted to Kroeker during the news conference. "Why not?" 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, while endorsing many of Kroeker's 
community-based policing suggestions, echoed that concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "To succeed, community-based policing has to be a partnership between the 
community and the police," said Ridley-Thomas, who represents South-Central Los 
Angeles. "That has yet to happen. There's far too little attention being given 
to that." 
</P>
<P>
 Community-based policing is an approach to law enforcement that dates back 
decades. In fact, former LAPD Chief Ed Davis, who commanded the department 
during the 1970s, is considered one of the pioneers of the idea, under which 
officers work closely with community representatives, cultivate contacts among 
residents, walk foot patrols and solicit suggestions about how to better 
protect the community. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the model of so-called professional policing, which stresses 
crime-fighting as the ultimate objective, community-based policing emphasizes 
crime prevention and service to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the LAPD has practiced some elements of community-based policing at 
least since Davis implemented it in 1970, that approach to law enforcement fell 
increasingly out of favor under former Chief Daryl F. Gates, who struggled with 
budget cuts and who tended to favor specialized units. 
</P>
<P>
 The March 3, 1991, beating of Rodney G. King by Los Angeles police officers, 
however, forced the department into the most wrenching period of 
self-examination and change in its history. In the wake of that beating, the 
blue-ribbon Christopher Commission examined the LAPD in detail and produced a 
228-page analysis of the department. 
</P>
<P>
 One of its many recommendations was that the LAPD aggressively embrace a new 
model of policing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Community-based policing would both increase the effectiveness of the police 
and diminish the tension between the public and the LAPD by eliminating the 
view of 'the community as the enemy,' " the authors of that report concluded. 
"Although we recognize that the culture of an organization developed over many 
years cannot be changed by simple fiat, it is now time to develop programs to 
de-emphasize force and promote restraint, to foster within the LAPD a different 
attitude toward the population it serves and to assist the public to gain 
greater trust in the department." 
</P>
<P>
 At Wednesday's news conference, officers acknowledged that the relationship 
with the communities they serve frayed in recent years. But they predicted that 
the community-based policing model will gradually repair that damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here to say today that, as a community, we are all learning," said 
Reggie Paige, one of the senior lead officers under the new program. "We have 
learned from our past mistakes. . . . We have to listen to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 That sentiment was applauded by some longtime department critics, including 
the American Civil Liberties Union, which has endorsed community-based policing 
and urged the LAPD to move toward that goal. That organization's Southern 
California director, Ramona Ripston, said the ACLU was "very enthusiastic about 
the idea" of community-based policing and was pleased that Kroeker was 
advancing the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Kroeker said the community-based policing model that he is implementing in 
South Bureau went into effect on Dec. 26 and will remain the guiding policy for 
his 1,200 officers for at least a year. At the end of that time, Kroeker said 
that he and his senior officers will review the program to determine whether it 
has proven itself. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, Kroeker said he will focus on whether violent crime has 
decreased, whether response time is acceptable and whether personnel complaints 
have dropped. The deputy chief added that he expects the LAPD to conduct 
community surveys to determine how residents view the services they are 
receiving under the new program. 
</P>
<P>
 As South Bureau officers launched their new initiative, many acknowledged that 
any policing program for South-Central and Southwest Los Angeles must take 
special aim at the area's murder rate. South Bureau logged 428 homicides during 
1993, the highest number of any of the LAPD's four geographic bureaus. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, one of the major tests of the community-based policing program 
will be whether it can produce a drop in the number of murders in South Bureau 
next year, Kroeker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope the people will be patient with us," Kroeker said. "This is a 
long-term investment, long and deep in every neighborhood. . . . We have to 
reduce the violence, and we will."

MEXICAN TROOPS STEP UP DRIVE TO CRUSH REVOLT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING and TRACY WILKINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Army troops conducted house-to-house searches here Wednesday while the air 
force bombarded suspected rebel strongholds in a push to crush a 6-day-old 
Indian revolt that has left scores dead and posed an embarrassing challenge to 
the government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari. 
</P>
<P>
 As the rebels appeared to continue withdrawing toward the jungle-covered hills 
of southern Mexico, government aircraft circled above on search-and-destroy 
missions. Panicked residents fled their villages, and the government offered to 
negotiate with the rebels -- but only if they first surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ocosingo, scene of some of the heaviest fighting earlier this week, bodies 
lay in the streets as troops hunting rebels kicked in doors and rummaged 
through the town's lone Roman Catholic church. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurrection -- the deadliest rebellion in this country in decades -- 
stunned Mexican authorities, who now appear embarked on efforts to demonstrate 
they can regain control. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the Salinas government spent millions of dollars in a tireless 
campaign to hone the image of Mexico as a blossoming democracy, a country 
poised on the horizon of economic greatness, a reliable trading partner. In a 
few short days, Mexican analysts say, that image was shattered by armed Indians 
demanding the most basic of concessions: land, a decent wage, humane living 
conditions, social equality. 
</P>
<P>
 The "New Mexico" was suddenly reminded of its ancient reality, of the millions 
of Mexicans who still live in abject poverty, of the plight of the descendants 
of the once-great Maya who have been left behind in Mexico's quest for 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mexican reality fell brutally on top of the imaginary country of the Salinas 
government," wrote columnist and economist Raymundo Riva Palacio in the 
financial newspaper El Financiero. "The public appearance of an armed movement 
is a serious wake-up call for a regime that has used decrees to make change." 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas is now faced with the daunting mission of repairing the image of 
Mexico that he worked so hard to cultivate. He appears intent on reassuring 
American politicians and investors, and on downplaying the violence as an 
isolated incident by people the government-controlled media refer to as 
"transgressors." 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge to Salinas' authority comes just as the ruling political party 
seemed guaranteed of an easy victory in this year's presidential elections, and 
it effectively upstaged the official Jan. 1 starting date of the North American 
Free Trade Agreement, the centerpiece of Salinas' policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican air force fired rockets into the rugged hillsides surrounding the 
picturesque town of San Cristobal de las Casas, according to witnesses and 
reporters. Armored personnel carriers rolled in after the air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Truckloads of troops rumbled through Ocosingo and over the winding roads here 
in Chiapas state, while others were used to evacuate frightened civilian 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 At last official account, 95 people have been killed since the rebels swept 
into six towns on New Year's Day, but the final toll is expected to be much 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 12,000 troops -- one-fifth of Mexico's armed forces -- were 
participating in the attack. The rebels are thought to number between 1,000 and 
2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the rockets fired Wednesday fell within yards of a crew for the 
Spanish-language television network, Univision. Members of the crew, who were 
not injured, said their van was clearly marked as belonging to the press, and 
the government promised to investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 Salinas' government Wednesday laid out conditions for peace talks with the 
guerrillas, who call themselves the Zapatista National Liberation Army in honor 
of revolutionary hero Emiliano Zapata. 
</P>
<P>
 Eloy Cantu Segovia, an Interior Ministry official appointed to represent 
Salinas in Chiapas, said in a communique that the rebels must agree to an 
immediate cease-fire, release any hostages and identify their leaders before 
talks can begin. They must also surrender all weapons and 3,000 pounds of 
dynamite they allegedly stole from the state oil company. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiapas, a lush but impoverished state that borders Guatemala, has witnessed 
years of conflict between the Mexican army and Indian peasants, who have long 
complained of economic and political isolation. Chiapas is controlled by 
political bosses, often accused of corruption, who are loyal to Salinas' 
Institutional Revolutionary Party. Reports of human rights abuses, in which 
Indians are victims, have increased in the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Government-controlled television Wednesday sought to emphasize the failure of 
the uprising to attract broader support from the residents of Chiapas state, 
but few analysts believe the problems exposed so dramatically by this week's 
events can be easily put aside. 
</P>
<P>
 The government maintains that while inequities continue to exist, Chiapas has 
not been neglected and in fact received $750 million in aid last year, about 8% 
of the budget for social programs. Still, Chiapas remains the country's poorest 
region, where 30% of the adults cannot read and 59% earn less than the meager 
minimum wage of just under $5 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts said the recent emphasis on NAFTA only underscored to Mexico's 
most downtrodden that they have been marginalized. The uprising seemed to raise 
questions about the true efficiency of the government's social works program, a 
cornerstone of the ruling party's staying power. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Salinas) was leaving office unscathed, going down as the great modernizer of 
Mexico, and then Chiapas shows that his whole strategy may have been flawed," 
Mexican political scientist Denise Dresser said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "Salinas was creating a two-tiered country of the haves and have-nots. I think 
he made the conscious decision to propel half of Mexico into the First World, 
even if that meant propelling the other half into the Fourth World. . . . Now 
he's confronted with his Achilles' heel." 
</P>
<P>
 The violence flies in the face of the picture that Salinas has painted in 
trips the world over, a picture that clearly distinguished Mexico from the 
remainder of insurrectional, unstable Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just when the government and the modern sectors it favors were proclaiming 
the transformation of Mexico into a member of North America, from Chiapas came 
the resounding voice of armed insurgency, to remind us just how Central 
American we are," wrote columnist Miguel Angel Granados Chapa, a frequent 
critic of the government, in the newspaper El Norte of Monterrey. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican stock market fell sharply when the Chiapas uprising was first 
reported, but it rallied Wednesday in a sign that foreign investors had not 
lost confidence in the Salinas government. 
</P>
<P>
 "For those who naively thought that in the aftermath of NAFTA, Mexico was free 
of problems and challenges, this is a sobering reminder of significant social 
and economic challenges," David Beers, a senior credit analyst with Standard & 
Poor's, said in a telephone interview from New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't seen this in Mexico for a while, and whether it portends a more 
serious and persistent challenge to the government is something that remains to 
be seen."

MCA TO BUILD THEME PARK IN JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY and JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Entertainment giant MCA Inc., which operates Universal Studios theme parks in 
Los Angeles and Orlando, Fla., on Wednesday announced plans to build a 
$1.5-billion park in Osaka, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 When completed in 1999, the 140-acre Universal Studios Japan is expected to 
rival Tokyo Disneyland in size, with a target of 8 million visitors in its 
first year of operation, Osaka city officials said. While Walt Disney Co.'s 
Euro Disney theme park in France is facing severe difficulties, the Tokyo park 
has been immensely successful since opening in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the MCA park will be the most dramatic venture to result from 
the 1990 purchase of Los Angeles-based MCA by Matsushita Electric Industrial 
Co. for $6.6 billion, the largest purchase ever of an American company by a 
foreign firm. Matsushita, the world's largest consumer electronics maker, is 
based in Osaka. 
</P>
<P>
 One question emerging is why MCA would build the park now, given Japan's 
weakened economy. Frank Stanek, president of MCA Enterprises International, 
said the company believes that Japan's economy will recover before the park 
opens in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are long-term projects. Recessions don't last forever no matter where 
we are," said Stanek, who is overseeing the project. He added that recessions 
often are a good time to build a major project because construction costs are 
usually lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Universal Studios Japan will be the first Universal Studios theme park built 
outside the United States. Like its U.S. counterparts, the theme park will 
feature replications of sets from famous Universal Pictures films such as 
"Jaws," "E.T." and "Jurassic Park" -- movies that have been very popular with 
Japanese audiences. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the theme park, the development is expected to include film and 
television production facilities. MCA and its partners are also considering 
building shopping, dining and entertainment areas and hotels on nearby land. 
</P>
<P>
 Key issues, including the percentage of ownership between the city of Osaka 
and MCA, remain to be resolved. Rank Organisation, a partner in Universal 
Studios Florida, may also participate in the project, according to MCA. 
</P>
<P>
 But Osaka Mayor Masaya Nishio and other officials expressed confidence that 
the park -- essentially a replica of the Universal Studios park in Florida -- 
will be built. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, MCA President Sidney J. Sheinberg suggested that finding the 
right location had not been easy. He added that MCA believes the project will 
be aided by its waterfront location, access to transportation and nearby 
redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 The park is to be built on Osaka Bay, with construction set to begin in 1996. 
Vacationers from South Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong, in addition to Japanese 
visitors, will have relatively easy access to the park site. Osaka is located 
245 miles west of Tokyo, about a three-hour ride by bullet train. 
</P>
<P>
 Prospects for the success of the project should be boosted by the impending 
completion of the new Kansai International Airport in Osaka, due to open in 
September. Kansai International, Japan's first 24-hour airport, is expected to 
become a major new transportation hub for East Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Osaka Mayor Nishio said that within this year, the city government, local 
industrial firms and MCA will form a new joint corporation called Universal 
Studios Japan to carry out the park project. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, MCA's Stanek downplayed Matsushita's influence on the 
decision to launch the park. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that MCA has been exploring the development of a theme park in Japan 
since 1980 -- well before Matsushita acquired the company.

UC REGENTS STIFLE DISSENT, MEMBER SAYS; EDUCATION: WILSON APPOINTEE EXPRESSES 
COMPLAINTS ABOUT UNIVERSITY'S GOVERNING BOARD IN A CANDID, SCATHING LETTER. HE 
SAYS IT TOO READILY GOES ALONG WITH THE SYSTEM'S ADMINISTRATORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an unusually candid -- and sometimes scathing -- analysis, a newly 
appointed University of California regent has criticized his colleagues for 
stifling dissent, being too eager to follow the lead of university 
administrators and for possibly violating the state's open meeting law when 
they voted two months ago in closed session to give UC hospital executives 
hefty pay raises. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward Connerly, a Sacramento land-use consultant appointed to the Board of 
Regents last March by Gov. Pete Wilson, aired his complaints in a five-page 
letter addressed to his colleagues and dated Dec. 21. The Times obtained a copy 
of the letter on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Connerly stopped short of calling the prestigious board a rubber stamp for 
university administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 But he depicted a governmental body where dissent is discouraged, where some 
regents are made uncomfortable -- or are too timid -- to voice opposing views, 
and where the internal pressure is to go along with how administrators are 
running the $9-billion university system. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is this view, in my opinion, which allows the public to believe that the 
regents fell asleep at the wheel during the Gardner era," Connerly wrote, 
referring in part to the board's controversial closed-door decision to give 
former UC President David Pierpont Gardner a $737,000 severance package in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Restoring public confidence, Connerly wrote, requires "effective governance." 
But he said that means the regents have to do more than vote "to hire a 
president and voting 'aye' on every issue placed before us by the president. . 
. . If we subscribe to this view, there is no reason for us to meet." 
</P>
<P>
 Connerly wrote that he was "uncomfortable" with the "severe time restraints" 
the regents put on students, faculty members and others at their meetings while 
administrators control the agenda and enjoy unlimited access. "They dine with 
us, they confer with us during the intervals between meetings and they have 
virtually unlimited opportunities to make their case at regents' meetings," he 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Connerly suggested that the regents set "standards of accountability" for the 
administrators and treat them as one of several "constituents" in the UC 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached in his Sacramento office, Connerly said he decided to unburden himself 
because of the regent's November meeting, in which they voted 13 to 5 in closed 
session to give raises to 13 top university hospital executives, already among 
the highest paid UC administrators. The decision aroused protests because other 
hospital employees have been forced to accept furloughs and the regents are 
considering another round of student fee hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Connerly, who voted against the raises, said he was particularly irked by 
remarks made by fellow Regent Dean A. Watkins of Palo Alto, who reportedly told 
board members during a closed-door session that voting against the raises would 
amount to a "no confidence" vote against President Jack W. Peltason. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is not the first time that has been said," Connerly said. "I think it 
went right to the heart of the culture of the board." 
</P>
<P>
 Connerly said he believed it was improper for the board to discuss the raises 
in executive session rather than in public. In his letter, Connerly accused the 
board of violating the "spirit, if not the letter," of the state's Open Meeting 
Law. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Lassiter, a university spokesman, said late Wednesday that the closed 
session was appropriate because regents were being asked to consider a 
personnel matter -- specific salaries for specific hospital executives. But 
Connerly said in his letter that the discussion dealt with pay classifications 
as well, a subject that is normally discussed in public. 
</P>
<P>
 Lassiter also said that UC President Peltason disagrees with Connerly's 
suggestion that board members consider university administrators as another 
"constituency" to be heard while making tough decisions. He said Peltason 
believes the administration and regents are to act as a "team." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like a City Council, or a legislative body that holds a hearing and 
makes a decision," Lassiter said about board meetings. "We're running an 
institution that is much more complex." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Connerly warned the board that it is in a "fragile stage" of 
transition where some regents may want to be more aggressive in holding the 
administration accountable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can either recognize this fact and guide the outcome of what we are to 
become or we can ignore what is occurring and run the risk of coming unraveled, 
fighting in public, and exchanging memos and letters which vent our 
frustrations with each other," he wrote.

STATE PRISON RELEASES WOMAN DYING OF AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK ARAX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 35-year-old woman dying of AIDS has been released from state prison after a 
three-month campaign by other inmates and AIDS activists who demanded her 
freedom on grounds of compassion. 
</P>
<P>
 Betty Jo Ross, who suffers from AIDS-related dementia and blindness, was 
released Tuesday night from the Central California Women's Facility at 
Chowchilla after serving four months of a two-year sentence for assault with a 
deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross' mother picked her up at the prison 35 miles northwest of Fresno and 
drove her home to East Palo Alto. Doctors have told Ross, a mother of three, 
that she has less than six months to live. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels so good to have my child home with me," said Ona Hall, Ross' mother. 
"I can see her perking up a little bit. But she's a pretty sick girl. I took 
her to the hospital today and they want to keep her for awhile." 
</P>
<P>
 James Gomez, the state's director of corrections, had twice rejected Ross' 
plea for early release, saying she was a violent offender who posed a threat to 
residents of a boardinghouse where she wanted to live with her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Inmates at the Chowchilla facility, which houses 3,861 prisoners, protested 
Gomez's decision, gathering more than 1,000 signatures and donning signs 
stating "Free Betty" and "Don't Let Betty Die in Prison." The San Francisco 
chapter of ACT UP, an AIDS activist group, began a letter campaign demanding 
her release. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last month, Gomez reversed course and granted Ross' request. Last week a 
Superior Court judge in Santa Clara County, where Ross was convicted in the 
May, 1993, assault, approved her release. 
</P>
<P>
 "Betty would still be inside if it wasn't for the campaign by the inmates, the 
support of the prison staff and the pressure put on the Department of 
Corrections by us," said Judy Greenspan of the ACT UP chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 Tip Kindel, a state corrections official, said the decision to grant Ross 
early release had nothing to do with the protest inside or outside the prison. 
Instead, Ross' mother, who ran the boardinghouse where Ross wanted to live, 
relinquished the business and assured state corrections officials that her 
daughter and grandchildren would be the only residents. 
</P>
<P>
 According to prison officials, Ross has a criminal history dating to 1976 and 
once spent 16 months in state prison for drug and property offenses. Her latest 
conviction stemmed from a store robbery in which she struck the owner on the 
head with a hammer. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before her sentence, Ross had been found to have AIDS. Shortly after 
arriving at the prison in September, Ross became so weak that other inmates had 
to carry her to the dining hall, according to ACT UP. The HIV-positive section 
of the prison, in which 52 infected inmates live, lacked a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross spent a month in the prison infirmary, where the staff determined that 
she was in the final stages of AIDS. The staff advocated her early release, a 
recommendation rejected by Gomez in November and again in early December. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross shared a cell with Joann Walker, who made sure she ate and took her 
medication. Walker spearheaded the petition drive and contacted ACT UP.

CAPITOL JOURNAL: LIKE IT OR NOT, HERE COMES THE GOVERNOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Up close, one on one, Gov. Pete Wilson is plenty likable. He grins. He's 
civil. He converses easily. He shows emotion. He may swear. He's human. He's 
interesting. He's clearly sharp. 
</P>
<P>
 Add more people to the room and a stiffness sets in. Give him an audience and 
a speech to read, especially before a television camera, and the words often 
come out flat. The voice cracks. The image is a cross between a nerd and a 
Marine. Experts say the camera doesn't lie. But there's obviously more to this 
man who has been elected governor, a U.S. senator, a mayor and a legislator, 
going back 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's biggest problem these days, as he begins an underdog race for 
reelection, is not the lagging California economy, the pesky budget deficit, 
the Democratic Legislature or voter anger at crime, schools and illegal 
immigration. His biggest problem is that voters don't like him much. 
</P>
<P>
 That's well-documented by polls. A statewide Times poll in October showed that 
more voters had an unfavorable impression of Wilson than favorable, 53% to 44%. 
The Field Poll consistently has found him to be the most unpopular governor in 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 So an underlying theme of Wilson's campaign -- one he isn't actually stating 
in words -- is that y o u don't have to like me to vote for me . "He's not a 
guy you like, but a guy you respect," explains one Wilson strategist. 
</P>
<P>
 To win a second term, Wilson knows that voters will have to respect him for 
having made the tough but necessary decisions on tax hikes and spending cuts, 
even if they were unpopular. He has to be seen as the solid, steady pilot they 
want at the wheel of state government in a storm. And who knows when this storm 
will end? Better not take risks, especially with the sister of Jerry Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And that brings us to Wilson's State of the State Address on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The subliminal message to legislators was: You don't have to like me to work 
with me; look at what we did together last year to help the business climate 
and how we all prospered politically . 
</P>
<P>
 And to the voters, he was saying: What gridlock in Sacramento? It's ended. You 
don't need a new Democratic governor to do that.  
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, gridlock gave way to progress in one of the most productive 
legislative sessions in history," Wilson told the lawmakers while urging a 
repeat performance. "California needs our leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting a few feet from the governor were his two Democratic rivals, Treasurer 
Kathleen Brown and Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi, both campaigning on 
the theme that Wilson's leadership is virtually nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
 And, by the way, the incumbent governor also is the candidate of change : "We 
can either shape change or suffer change. . . . Let's lead that change." But, 
of course, "We've already made major change. . . . Think where we'd be now if 
we hadn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Remember all those tough, unpopular decisions : "If we continue to make the 
right choices, even though they are tough choices today, California can soar 
into the 21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
 But let's also keep our feet on the ground and not get too caught up with 
Brown or Garamendi in the vision thing : "Many Californians -- quite 
understandably -- are less concerned about the coming century than about the 
security of their job today and the safety of their families tonight. . . . New 
jobs and safe streets are the twin pillars on which we must build California's 
future. . . . But to attract more jobs, we must first reclaim our communities 
from violent crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Jobs and crime : Wilson's two main issues, as usual. They're also currently 
the electorate's. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Is it pandering or responding to voters when a governor -- any politician -- 
jumps all over a hot issue like crime? It's a fine line. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a cynical point of view, it's tailor-made for a political campaign," 
says the Wilson adviser. "But it's also the issue of the day. And these 
(Democratic legislators) up here are scared to death." Notes another GOP 
strategist: "There are worse things in the world than politicians actually 
doing what the public wants. That's not pandering; that's doing your job." 
</P>
<P>
 The governor on Wednesday proposed spending additional billions for more cops, 
more prisons and longer sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our streets are being stained with the blood of our children and, damn it, 
it's got to stop," he said, as the father of the murdered Polly Klaas looked on 
from the balcony. "There will be those who protest such costs. They'll complain 
that they would prefer to spend the money on higher education. . . . Well, so 
would I. But this is not a matter of choice. . . . Does anyone want to assign a 
dollar value to 400 murdered children (in 1993)?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson knows he and the voters are agreed on that much, even if they don't 
especially like him. His campaign will be about getting their respect.

HOPPING MAD; CUSTOMERS HATE TO SEE ANAHEIM RESTAURANT'S BUNNIES GO 
</P>

 On Wednesday afternoon, Marla Behm was on her knees in the grass outside El 
Torito Restaurant and Cantina, coaxing four rabbits to eat some lettuce from 
her hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love them," said Behm, of Fullerton, who visits the restaurant so she can 
watch the rabbits while she eats. "I give them all my leftovers, my hors 
d'oeuvres too. They eat anything. Even tortilla chips." 
</P>
<P>
 But for Behm and other customers who love El Torito's rabbits, it may soon be 
a case of hare today, gone tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 The domestic rabbits, abandoned by their owners, have lived for years in 
burrows in the hilly, shaded greenbelt that separates the El Torito and Charley 
Brown's restaurants and have become an added attraction for some restaurant 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 But in recent months, the rabbit population has exploded, and the furry 
animals have become victims of malnutrition, disease and motorists, who have 
run over several in the parking lot and nearby streets, said Lt. Marie 
Hulett-Curtner, public education officer and spokeswoman for Orange County 
Animal Control. 
</P>
<P>
 In the hope of finding homes for the estimated 75 rabbits, the management of 
the restaurants, county animal control officials and the nonprofit House Rabbit 
Society have begun an adoption program -- much to the dismay of some restaurant 
patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they should leave some of them here to keep the atmosphere," said Tom 
Hruden, an Anaheim businessman who frequently eats lunch at El Torito. "But 
they should let people take (some of) them as pets when they're young. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Buckley and Clydora White said they always choose a window table in the 
bar so they can watch the rabbits. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why we come here. We enjoy watching them," said Buckley, who works 
nearby and believes the rabbits should be left alone. "I've had rabbits at 
home. But here they have a place to be free." 
</P>
<P>
 The rabbits do not pose a public health risk, Hulett-Curtner said, but they do 
not fare well on the diet that restaurant customers offer them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rabbits don't live a very good life at the restaurant," she said. "People 
think it's OK to abandon them. But they're dying of disease and malnutrition. 
They're domesticated animals and they can't care for themselves. They need real 
homes. We need to stop the cycle." 
</P>
<P>
 With no one willing to assume responsibility for the rabbits' welfare, the 
adoption program is the only option, Hulett-Curtner said. A spokeswoman for El 
Torito Restaurants Inc. said there are too many rabbits for the restaurant to 
care for. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs will be posted later this week warning people not to abandon their pets, 
which is a misdemeanor, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rabbit population can be expected to keep growing because rabbits can 
reproduce, well, like rabbits. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie Gigous, co-chapter manager of the 250-member House Rabbit organization, 
said the group is looking for bunny lovers willing to treat the rabbits as 
house pets. People wishing to adopt the rabbits will be screened by the 
society. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to find homes to conform what we think they should have. You want 
the best for them," she said. "We don't want the bunny put in a back-yard hutch 
with food and water." 
</P>
<P>
 But restaurant guests Buckley and White say they won't come back if the 
rabbits disappear. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably won't come here to eat. They'll lose two good customers," White 
said.

GUN OWNERS PUSH ROBERTI RECALL DRIVE; POLITICS: A SPOKESMAN SAYS MORE THAN 
45,000 VOTER SIGNATURES HAVE BEEN COLLECTED TO PUT THE MATTER ON A MARCH OR 
APRIL BALLOT. THE SENATOR'S BID TO SEEK STATE TREASURER'S POST MAY BE AFFECTED. 
</P>

 Anti-gun control activists and others said Wednesday they have collected 
enough voter signatures to force an election seeking the recall of state Senate 
Leader David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) this spring, when he will have less than 
eight months left in office. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Constitutional Rights Federation, a Mission Hills-based 
gun owners group, said anti-Roberti activists gathered more than 45,000 voter 
signatures, more than twice the number needed to stage a recall in late March 
or April. 
</P>
<P>
 The powerful Senate president pro tem, who must leave that post in November 
because of term limits, plans to run for state treasurer this year. His 
prospects for statewide office could be damaged if voters in his home district 
toss him out of the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Gun owners remain angry at Roberti for co-sponsoring a 1989 ban on 
military-style semiautomatic assault weapons and his current efforts to limit 
the number of bullets that can be held in rifle and pistol magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 Gun activists mounted a nationwide grass-roots campaign to defeat Roberti in 
his bid for the Van Nuys-based 20th Senate District seat in a 1992 special 
election. They mailed more than 400,000 leaflets to local voters attacking him 
on a variety of issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite heavy campaign spending, Roberti barely defeated a novice Republican 
candidate, Carol Rowen of Tarzana. A Roberti aide later said that the gun 
owners' flyers had a significant impact on the race. 
</P>
<P>
 For the recall election to be held, anti-Roberti activists must submit 20,670 
valid voter signatures by today. A spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County voter 
registrar said Wednesday that more than 10,000 signatures already have been 
certified as valid. The county has until Feb. 5 to certify all the signatures. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the voter registrar's office said she did not know how much 
a recall election would cost. 
</P>
<P>
 A Roberti spokesman lashed out at recall proponents, labeling them "radical 
gunners" willing to waste taxpayer dollars to wreak political revenge on 
Roberti. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is much bigger than David Roberti," said spokesman Steven Glazer. "This 
is a battle about whether or not the state has the right to provide reasonable 
limits on guns." 
</P>
<P>
 Dolores White, a Reseda real estate agent and a sponsor of the recall effort, 
said anti-Roberti forces are a coalition of groups that includes more than just 
gun owners. The coalition's members include crime victims, environmentalists 
and former Roberti supporters who have turned against him, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But White acknowledged that most groups in the coalition represent gun owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel Fernandez, chairman of the Constitutional Rights Federation, which 
represents gun owners in the San Fernando Valley, said the recall is indeed 
intended as a pay-back for Roberti's gun control efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole purpose of the recall of Roberti is retribution for the passage of 
the semiautomatic rifle ban," said Fernandez, who helped spearhead the 1992 
campaign against Roberti. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez, a law firm researcher from Mission Hills, is a former leader of 
another anti-Roberti group, Californians Against Corruption, which participated 
in the 1992 campaign and is part of the recall coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a letter obtained by The Times, CAC this year asked the National 
Rifle Assn. to help bankroll the recall effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to engage the enemy, to work the enemy, to get in so close we can 
smell 'em," said the Feb. 5, 1993, letter, signed by CAC advisory board member 
Richard L. Carone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roberti is the most vulnerable high-visibility target in California, and we 
need a major victory here. With (President) Clinton in power, the nation needs 
one too." 
</P>
<P>
 But George McNeill, who heads NRA lobbying efforts in statehouses around the 
United States, said the NRA has declined to give money to the recall group. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state recall rules, Roberti must win a majority of the votes cast to 
retain his office. Other candidates can qualify for the same ballot and if 
Roberti is recalled, the top vote-getter among them would be elected to serve 
out the balance of his term. 
</P>
<P>
 Glazer said the senator will survive any recall, adding that Roberti plans to 
"fight like hell" and has at least $250,000 in campaign funds.

ACCUSED SOVIET COUP PLOTTERS MUST FACE TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Want to avoid jail? Just get yourself elected to Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what two accused plotters of the 1991 coup attempt thought. They tried 
Wednesday to convince a Russian court that they need no longer stand trial for 
trying to overthrow then-Soviet leader Mikhail S. Gorbachev because they have 
won election to the new Parliament and, as lawmakers, now enjoy statutory 
immunity from prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 But the court ruled that the immunity does not extend to crimes committed two 
years prior to election, and ordered the coup plotters to stand trial for 
treason. 
</P>
<P>
 The novel defense ploy was the latest bizarre twist in the protracted saga 
that has left many Russians wondering if the former Soviet leaders charged with 
masterminding the August, 1991, coup attempt will ever be brought to justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a new set of accused plotters, including former Vice President 
Alexander V. Rutskoi and former Parliament Chairman Ruslan I. Khasbulatov, are 
still jailed in a former KGB prison while the October rebellion is being 
investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 In a show of nostalgia for the old regime, voters elected to the new Russian 
Parliament two of the men who said they staged the 1991 coup to try to save the 
ailing Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Anatoly I. Lukyanov, 63, a chairman of the Soviet Union's old Supreme Soviet, 
was elected to the lower house, or Duma, and Vasily A. Starodubtsev, 62, a 
collective farm leader, beat four other candidates to win a seat in the upper 
house, or Federation Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors argued to the three judges for the military branch of the Supreme 
Court that Russia's newly adopted constitution provides absolute immunity only 
for the president. As for immunity for judges and lawmakers, "there are nuances 
here," prosecutor Oleg Ankudinov said. 
</P>
<P>
 The court agreed and ordered the defendants to return to trial on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The new legislature's maiden session will be on Tuesday.

OUSTED GEORGIA LEADER A SUICIDE, HIS WIFE SAYS; CAUCASUS: OTHER REPORTS SAY 
GAMSAKHURDIA WAS SLAIN BY FOES OR ALLIES. THE ONETIME HERO WAS LATER BRANDED A 
TYRANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Zviad Gamsakhurdia, the ousted Georgian president who inspired a civil war 
that devastated his homeland, is believed to have committed suicide in exile in 
western Georgia, his wife and other sources said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Manana Gamsakhurdia told authorities and reporters that her 54-year-old 
husband shot himself to death in the early morning of Dec. 31 after his 
stronghold in the village of Dzhikhaskari was ambushed by pro-government 
troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Gamsakhurdia said that Georgian authorities knew of her husband's death 
but concealed it, and that she was informed of his death only on Wednesday, 
Russian news agencies reported. 
</P>
<P>
 However, numerous conflicting versions of Gamsakhurdia's death poured into 
Moscow from the Georgian capital of Tbilisi and from Chechnya, a breakaway 
republic in southern Russia where Gamsakhurdia spent time after a junta 
overthrew him in January, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 One report from Tbilisi held that Gamsakhurdia was badly wounded in a Dec. 31 
skirmish on Chechen territory and died Wednesday in the Chechen capital of 
Grozny. Another suggested he may have been shot in a fight with his own 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgian officials in Tbilisi and Moscow said that Mrs. Gamsakhurdia, who is 
in Grozny, "was misinformed" and that all available information was based on 
rumor and had yet to be verified. 
</P>
<P>
 Gamsakhurdia's supporters released what they said were the rebel leader's last 
words. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being of sound mind, I commit this act in protest against the existing regime 
in Georgia and because I am deprived of the possibility to act as president, to 
normalize the situation and to restore law and order," Gamsakhurdia is quoted 
as having said several minutes before his death. The message was distributed by 
Gamsakhurdia's press service in Grozny. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian Television reported that the former dissident, who led the Georgian 
independence movement but was accused of turning dictatorial as soon as he took 
power, had grown despondent in defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 In an 11 p.m. broadcast, the station's Tbilisi correspondent said Gamsakhurdia 
had retreated from western Georgia after his army was thrashed by troops loyal 
to Georgian President Eduard A. Shevardnadze. The philologist-turned-general 
fled to the mountains and then came down to live with a farm family in the 
village of Dzhikhaskari. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty days ago, Gamsakhurdia began a hunger strike, and by the end of December 
the burly leader had shrunk to 132 pounds. On Dec. 29, the report said, he 
asked for a Bible to be placed under his head. He did not rise again. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4 a.m. on Dec. 31, his bodyguards reportedly heard a muffled shot in the 
next room and found that the rebel leader had killed himself with a shot to the 
temple with a Stechkin navy pistol. Gamsakhurdia was buried in the yard of the 
farmhouse, the TV report said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would add that there is no complete clarity as to what really happened," 
the TV announcer said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not at all clear that Gamsakhurdia's death will bring peace to Georgia 
at last. 
</P>
<P>
 One political analyst said that while Gamsakhurdia's death will deprive the 
opposition of its most potent symbol, other leaders will quickly rise to take 
his place. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Shevardnadze is still trying to bring an end to a separatist 
rebellion in the Black Sea republic of Abkhazia. Separatists there are holding 
their territory, but in a New Year's address, Shevardnadze said their victory 
is temporary. 
</P>
<P>
 If confirmed, Gamsakhurdia's suicide would be the last act of a historic and 
messianic figure. 
</P>
<P>
 An intellectual and the son of a famous Georgian novelist and patriot, 
Gamsakhurdia inspired a virtual cult of nationalism among supporters known as 
"Zviadists." 
</P>
<P>
 He was first arrested as an anti-Soviet dissident at the age of 17, in 1956, 
and then arrested again in 1977 for founding a human rights group. In one of 
the most controversial acts of his career, Gamsakhurdia recanted on television 
and was released after serving two years of his five-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Soviet Union waned, Gamsakhurdia emerged as the leader of the Georgian 
independence movement and quickly became the most popular man in Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 9, 1991, Gamsakhurdia declared Georgia's independence from the Soviet 
Union. The next month he was elected president with 87% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Within months, he was being vilified as a tyrant. He arrested political 
opponents, closed down newspapers and inspired fear in Georgia's ethnic 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Gamsakhurdia said the Kremlin -- and Shevardnadze -- were inspiring his 
opposition. Members of the military junta that eventually overthrew him claimed 
his men were torturing opponents with electric shocks in the basement of the 
Parliament building. 
</P>
<P>
 His isolationist, nationalist policies alienated many, but he retained 
thousands of fervent supporters. Eventually, bloody battles between supporters 
and foes drove him into exile on Jan. 6, 1992. Shevardnadze, the distinguished 
former Soviet foreign minister, was invited back to lead Georgia and was 
subsequently elected president. 
</P>
<P>
 Gamsakhurdia supporters clashed repeatedly with government troops after their 
president was deposed. Twice during his exile, Gamsakhurdia rallied his armed 
followers to attempt to topple Shevardnadze. Last fall he almost succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
 Shevardnadze blamed Gamsakhurdia for the chronic civil wars that have plunged 
Georgia into political and economic anarchy, with long bread lines, fuel 
shortages, waves of refugees, widespread lawlessness and nearly universal 
misery.

SHUN NATO, YELTSIN WARNS EX-SATELLITES; RUSSIA: PRESIDENT CONDEMNS LITHUANIA'S 
REQUEST FOR MEMBERSHIP. HE CRITICIZES 'BLOC PSYCHOLOGY' OF SEEKING PROTECTION 
FROM MOSCOW. 
</P>

<P>
 President Boris N. Yeltsin moved swiftly Wednesday to denounce a request from 
Lithuania for NATO membership and criticize the "bloc psychology" of former 
Soviet satellites that seek a military alliance to protect them from Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin spokesman Vyacheslav V. Kostikov said the extension of the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization to Russia's very borders would provoke a negative 
reaction among the Russian public. 
</P>
<P>
 He said it would also "promote the development of undesirable moods in 
civilian and military circles," a barely veiled reference to newly elected 
neo-fascist lawmaker Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky, who wants to restore Russia's 
lost empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin fears that a burgeoning NATO could eventually "trigger 
military-political destabilization in the region which is key for the future of 
the world," Kostikov said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian statement followed soothing remarks made Tuesday by U.S. 
officials, who are backing a "Partnership for Peace" program for the Eastern 
European and Baltic nations as an alternative to NATO membership, to avoid any 
hint of alienating the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 Just days before President Clinton leaves for his first European summit, the 
United States has been advertising the Partnership for Peace plan as a way to 
ease European fears without irritating Moscow and re-polarizing Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, outgoing U.S. Defense Secretary Les Aspin telephoned Russian 
Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev, using a new hot line that links their 
offices, to personally invite Russia to join the Partnership for Peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Aspin said Grachev expressed "interest" during their 55-minute conversation 
but did not indicate whether Russia might join, the Associated Press reported. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior U.S. official was optimistic. "I expect Russia will join the 
Partnership for Peace very soon," the official said, raising the possibility 
that an announcement could be made at the upcoming summit. 
</P>
<P>
 A Russian Defense Ministry spokeswoman said Grachev favors not the expansion 
of NATO but "the path leading to a truly pan-European security system." Grachev 
noted that Russia and NATO already cooperate bilaterally and through 
multinational groups. 
</P>
<P>
 While Russia's pro-Western Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev has been warm to 
the partnership plan, a senior Russian analyst said Wednesday that some Kremlin 
officials consider it NATO by another name. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some of them, this Partnership for Peace is just the first step to expand 
and absorb the Central European nations," said Andrei V. Kortunov, a researcher 
at Moscow's U.S.A. and Canada Institute and an informal adviser to the Yeltsin 
government. "They are suspicious." 
</P>
<P>
 The NATO plan tries to avoid East-West polarization by allowing any country to 
join and offering no hard and fast promise of NATO rescue in case of attack. 
</P>
<P>
 To join the partnership, countries would have to demonstrate a commitment to 
democracy and the peaceful resolution of disputes, along with civilian control 
of the military. 
</P>
<P>
 But some of Yeltsin's advisers were raised to view NATO as "a sinister plot of 
Western imperialism" and "somewhere in their souls, they still have this 
image," Kortunov said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lithuania, a nation of 3.7 million that was occupied by the Soviet Union for 
nearly five decades, formally requested NATO membership on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The other Baltic nations, Estonia and Latvia, have also said they will 
eventually ask for membership. Hungary, Poland and the Czech Republic are also 
pushing for admission, while Slovakia wants NATO security guarantees.

GEORGIAN ADMITS KILLING U.S. ENVOY

<P>
 A Georgian accused of murdering a U.S. diplomat went on trial Wednesday and 
confessed to the killing, an official at the republic's Supreme Court said. 
</P>
<P>
 The diplomat, Fred Woodruff, was killed Aug. 8 last year by a single bullet to 
the head while traveling in a car with Georgian leader Eduard A. Shevardnadze's 
security chief. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials later acknowledged that Woodruff had been working for the CIA. 
</P>
<P>
 The accused man has been identified as Anzor Sharmaidze, a 21-year-old 
resident of the capital, Tbilisi. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sharmaidze admitted his guilt but said he did not know who was in the car. He 
wanted to take gasoline from them," the court official said.

RESTRICTIONS AT PRIVATE GOLF CLUBS ARE TEEING OFF PLENTY OF WOMEN; FEMALE 
PLAYERS OFTEN FIND THEY'RE NOT WELCOME IN A WORLD OF MALE PRIVILEGE. BUT STATES 
ARE HELPING.

<P>
 Women are heading to golf courses in unprecedented numbers nationwide, but 
they don't always find the welcome mat when they attempt to tee off. 
</P>
<P>
 The reception at some private clubs can be downright chilly, thanks to 
restrictive membership policies, limited tee times and curtailed privileges. 
</P>
<P>
 Close to 40% of beginning golfers are women, and their numbers have been 
steadily increasing for several years, according to the National Golf 
Foundation of Jupiter, Fla. But many apparently quit in frustration over 
difficulties in gaining access to courses. 
</P>
<P>
 The $20-billion-a-year golf industry is wooing female executives by promoting 
the game as a savvy business tool. But at certain private clubs, working women 
may find few tee times available during their off-hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, several states are using tougher laws to wage an incremental war against 
the remnants of male privilege on the golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 * Minnesota denies property tax breaks to private golf clubs that 
discriminate. And a bill to be introduced this year would amend the state's 
human rights act to include a ban on discrimination based on marital status. 
</P>
<P>
 * Michigan amended its civil rights act in 1992 to include many private clubs 
under provisions prohibiting discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Wisconsin Legislature is considering a bill that could revoke liquor 
licenses of golf courses that discriminate against women in assigning weekend 
tee times. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, private clubs have been able to operate as they wish, picking 
and choosing their members and rules. The contention is that they are protected 
by constitutional right to freedom of association. Federal law doesn't prohibit 
sex discrimination by private clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although such discrimination is gaining attention among women's rights groups, 
the issue must compete with myriad causes. "It's one of many economic issues," 
said Kim Gandy, vice president of the National Organization for Women in 
Washington, D.C. "We believe women should have equal access to the country's 
economic mainstream, and in that sense golf clubs are part of it, but only one 
part." More pressing for many NOW members are issues including equal pay, the 
glass ceiling and sexual harassment, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman's experience helped force the Minnesota law changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary McCourtney Heilman and her husband joined Interlachen Country Club in 
Edina, Minn., in 1974. Her husband was considered the club shareholder, and she 
was subject to restricted tee times. When McCourtney Heilman's husband died in 
1988, he bequeathed her the golf membership -- but the club told her she could 
not have it. 
</P>
<P>
 She was made an associate member and her monthly dues were cut in half, but 
McCourtney Heilman said that she wasn't allowed to play golf whenever she 
wished. When she remarried, she was kicked out of the club. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most men said that's just the way the rules are," McCourtney Heilman said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Interlachen general manager Tom Wurr, "There is absolutely no 
difference in treatment between men and women under any circumstances." The 
club, which Wurr said is in full compliance with state law, decided earlier 
this year to change the provision that axed McCourtney Heilman's membership. A 
surviving spouse who remarries now may retain associate membership. 
</P>
<P>
 But a married couple must still designate one person as the stockholder. That 
person holds the membership and voting rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can tell you that Interlachen has never rejected a female applicant, at 
least to my knowledge," Wurr said. He would not reveal how many female 
stockholders the club has, except to say they are in the minority. 
</P>
<P>
 When Minnesota State Sen. Ember Reichgott Junge was told about McCourtney 
Heilman's treatment, she sponsored an amendment passed last year that 
eliminated tax breaks for clubs that discriminate in membership or selection on 
the basis of marital status. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota golf courses enjoy a considerable property tax rate break under open 
space laws. In 1986, the state banned discrimination on the basis of gender, or 
else higher rates would apply. 
</P>
<P>
 But Minnesota's Stillwater Country Club decided to pay the higher tax rather 
than change its membership bylaws. Women could not be full members. So this 
year, the Legislature upped the ante. 
</P>
<P>
 Effective in 1995, Minnesota county assessors will figure the tax rate as if 
the non-complying club's land were not only converted for development, but also 
available for sale as individual parcels. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Stillwater Country Club, the valuation would rise from $1.5 
million to about $6 million, forcing the club to pay about $238,000 more each 
year in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Stillwater has changed its policy and starting in January, women may hold full 
memberships. Family memberships now are held in the man's name. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, many clubs are believed to have changed with the times, especially 
in light of anti-discrimination policies adopted by organizations, including 
the Ladies Professional Golf Assn. The LPGA adopted a policy in 1991 that 
requires tournament sponsors to hold events at courses that do not discriminate 
in membership policies on the basis of race, religion, gender or national 
origin. A Growing Force 
</P>
<P>
 The number of female golfers in the United States, defined as players over age 
12 at all levels, as been increasing steadily for several years: 1987: 4.8 
million 1988: 5.1 million 1992: 5.4 million * 
</P>
<P>
 * About 40% of the players who have taken up the game since 1986 are women. 
</P>
<P>
 * 22% of those who say they play on a regular basis are women.

 The U.S. envoy to the United Nations said Wednesday that Croatia could face 
economic sanctions if it fails to heed warnings about staying out of the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked at a news conference about the U.S. view of Croatian support for ethnic 
kin in the Bosnian conflict, Madeleine Albright said, "I can tell you this is a 
subject that comes up frequently and that might in fact lead to sanctions if 
there is not some change on this issue." 
</P>
<P>
 She added: "We are very concerned about those activities. We have in any 
number of ways warned the Croatian government and the military specifically on 
this subject." 
</P>
<P>
 The highest-ranking U.S. official ever to visit Croatia, Albright said she 
will raise the issue of Croatia's role in the war with President Franjo 
Tudjman. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. and military observers have confirmed that Croatia has helped arm Bosnian 
Croat forces, but the government has denied direct involvement in the war.

BHUTTO FAMILY FEUD LEADS TO BLOODSHED; PAKISTAN: POLICE LOYAL TO PRIME MINISTER 
BENAZIR BHUTTO OPEN FIRE ON A MARCH LED BY HER MOTHER. 
</P>

<P>
 The feud among the Bhuttos, Pakistan's first family, degenerated into 
bloodshed Wednesday when riot police loyal to Benazir, the prime minister, 
opened fire with guns and tear gas on a march led by her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said at least one young man was killed and four other people were 
injured in the clash in the town of Larkana, the ruling clan's ancestral home 
in rural eastern Pakistan. 
</P>
<P>
 Nusrat Bhutto, 63, who with hundreds of sympathizers wanted to visit the tomb 
of her husband, passed out after inhaling some of the acrid gas but was not 
seriously hurt, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Bhutto women came to Larkana, 300 miles north of Karachi, to pay their 
respects on the 66th anniversary of the birth of Nusrat's husband, the late 
Prime Minister Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day of celebration has been turned into a day of mourning," the estranged 
mother of Pakistan's prime minister told reporters. "I am very sad. I am very 
perturbed. This is not democracy; this is a police state." 
</P>
<P>
 A Sind province official claimed that police fired only when the crowd, which 
carried clubs and sticks, captured a policeman and pummeled him. 
</P>
<P>
 For seven years, the mercurial and charismatic Bhutto ruled Pakistan. But he 
was toppled by the army in 1977 and hanged two years later. In the past several 
months, Bhutto's widow and his 40-year-old daughter have become furious rivals 
keen on capturing the legacy and political machine left by the man known as 
Quaid-e-Awam (People's Leader). Yet another Bhutto -- Benazir's kid brother, 
Murtaza -- has taken his mother's side. 
</P>
<P>
 The people fired on by police were marching in support of Nusrat Bhutto and 
the 39-year-old Murtaza, who is in jail on terrorism charges but is being 
touted by his mother as the legitimate leader of the Pakistan People's Party. 
</P>
<P>
 "Murtaza is our leader! Murtaza is our hero!" they yelled. "God help Murtaza!" 
</P>
<P>
 Police fired tear gas and then assault rifles as the throng emerged from the 
family home in Larkana, where Nusrat lives, to escort her to Ali Bhutto's grave 
about 20 miles out of town, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 The stone walls of the Bhutto home were pockmarked with bullet holes. Police 
stopped Nusrat from leaving, forcing her car back at gunpoint into the family 
compound. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said another column of several hundred marchers on their way to the 
Bhutto home were sprayed with tear gas by police. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials told reporters that more than 12,000 police officers were brought 
into Larkana to try to prevent the family dispute from kindling violence. They 
were deployed by the thousands around the Bhutto home and in the streets after 
midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Benazir Bhutto wanted to prevent her brother's supporters from attending the 
birthday ceremony for their father, so troops erected roadblocks and uncoiled 
barbed wire to block roads leading to the grave at Garhi Khuda Bakhsh. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bhuttos' quarrel took center stage in Pakistani politics last month after 
Benazir engineered the ouster of her mother as chairwoman of the ruling PPP and 
got herself elected in her mother's stead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been stabbed in the back," Nusrat Bhutto protested. She says the post 
belongs by right to her son as the late Ali Bhutto's male heir. 
</P>
<P>
 Murtaza and Benazir have not exchanged a word since he returned home after 16 
years in self-imposed exile last November. He was promptly clapped in jail on 
his sister's orders and now faces charges that he masterminded the hijacking of 
an airliner and an attack against the Pakistani navy. 
</P>
<P>
 A court in Karachi rejected his application for parole to go to his father's 
grave. 
</P>
<P>
 In a brief morning visit, Benazir Bhutto called at the grave, prayed and 
draped a scarf over the tomb.

CLINTON WILL GO SLOW ON PLEA TO EXPAND NATO; DIPLOMACY: HE SAYS IT WOULD BE "A 
CRITICAL MISTAKE" TO EXTEND MEMBERSHIP TO EAST EUROPEAN COUNTRIES NOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK NELSON, TIMES WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton said Wednesday that it would be "a critical mistake" to 
extend immediate NATO membership to East European countries because doing so 
could fuel feelings of insecurity and nationalism in the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 But he sought to reassure Poland and other former Soviet satellites that the 
United States remains committed to their freedom and economic development, and 
that full partnership with the West -- including NATO membership -- is still a 
likely prospect for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, interviewed at a White House luncheon by a small group of journalists 
three days before he is to leave for critical summit meetings with the heads of 
the NATO countries, Russia and Eastern Europe, presented a middle-ground 
approach designed to draw the former satellites closer to the Western Alliance 
without sowing alarm in Russia and Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's concern that Russia would react adversely to any early move to 
expand NATO's membership was underscored by Moscow's harsh reaction Wednesday 
to a decision by Lithuania to apply for membership in the organization, which 
was created at the outset of the Cold War to halt Soviet expansionism. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin's spokesman warned that expanding NATO 
could evoke "a negative reaction in Russian public opinion" and play into the 
hands of the country's extreme nationalists. Lithuania is the first former 
Soviet republic to seek admittance to the 16-nation alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 Granting immediate NATO membership to East European countries such as Poland 
and the Czech Republic, as some have requested, does not have the support of 
all the present NATO members, Clinton noted, and might ultimately have the 
effect of creating much the same kind of division that existed during the Cold 
War. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want right now in 1994 to draw a new line across Europe which will 
make the very people we're trying to support be, in effect, more insecure," the 
President said. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that both Russia, with its historical fears of encirclement, and the 
politically and economically fragile Ukraine retain formidable nuclear 
arsenals. And ultranationalists have become increasingly vocal all across the 
former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of feeding such tendencies by a rapid expansion of NATO, Clinton 
suggested, the U.S. proposal for a "Partnership for Peace" -- in which Russia 
as well as the East Europeans would be invited to take a series of 
tension-lowering steps leading to the prospect of eventual NATO membership -- 
offers the possibility of developing a broad-based alliance in which all 
members would be committed to peaceful coexistence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important to emphasize that we view it not as putting a limit on 
NATO membership, but as opening the door to fuller partnership," he said, 
adding, "I think it clearly will lead, ultimately, to some more countries 
coming into NATO at some point in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. goal, he said, is "a Europe that is free of the dividing lines of the 
past, instead of just moving them a little bit further east." 
</P>
<P>
 While Clinton devoted considerable attention to the need to reassure Eastern 
Europe that it will not be abandoned to any future resurgence of Russian 
expansionism, he also emphasized the importance of reaffirming America's 
commitment to democracy and economic reform in Russia. The pace of economic 
reform should not be slowed, he said, but greater effort must be made to 
provide a safety net for individuals and families hurt by the transition from 
communism to free markets. 
</P>
<P>
 One senior Administration official predicted Wednesday that Russia is likely 
to join the plan to bring the former Warsaw Pact countries of Eastern Europe 
into Clinton's proposed Partnership for Peace. NATO members are expected to 
ratify the plan at their meeting Monday, and the official said he expects 
Russia to join "very soon." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan is designed gradually to draw into NATO all former Warsaw Pact 
countries that demonstrate their commitment to democratic principles and their 
willingness to work with NATO military powers. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian officials themselves have given little public indication of which way 
they will go on the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said he had considered and rejected others' views that if NATO does 
not take in the European countries while Russia is weak, once Russia is strong 
again it might refuse to let its former satellites join. 
</P>
<P>
 It would take at least several years for Russia to become that strong, he 
said, if for no other reason than "the enormous impact that the rampant 
inflation in Russia had on the military capacity of the country." 
</P>
<P>
 In pressing campaigns for earlier admission to NATO, some East European 
countries, especially Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic, have cited fears 
of resurgent Russian nationalism fueled by the success of Vladimir V. 
Zhirinovsky and his party in the Dec. 12 Russian elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about Zhirinovsky's rise, Clinton said, "I wouldn't say it scares me, 
but it concerns me." 
</P>
<P>
 Declaring that many voted for Zhirinovsky and his party because they wanted to 
feel Russia was strong again, the President said: "A lot of the bad guys that 
have been elected in history got elected for reasons that didn't have anything 
to do with their most outrageous claims. And, yet, they did what they said 
they'd do when they got in. So it is a concern."

COLD, HIGH WINDS RAKE PARTS OF MIDWEST 
</P>

<P>
 A new winter storm plunged parts of the Midwest into a deep freeze Wednesday, 
with strong winds making it feel like it was 60 below zero, weather officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It officially was 9 below zero amid blinding snow at midmorning Wednesday in 
Bismarck, N. D., where the new storm was spinning rapidly southward.But strong 
winds raking the state produced the brutal wind chills. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters said snow from the storm would spread from the Dakotas through 
Iowa, Wisconsin, Illinois, Michigan and on into New England. They warned 
residents of south Texas and northern Florida to brace for freezing 
temperatures by the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Candor, a forecaster for Accu-Weather Inc., said the new storm was not 
packing the potential for snowfall as heavy as the one that struck the East on 
Monday and Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In parts of the East, thousands of people were without power and many roads 
remained impassable. 
</P>
<P>
 In Barboursville, W. Va., Mary Cazad said she used wood from one of eight pine 
trees that were toppled in her yard to keep her fireplace ablaze until the 
power returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Waynesburg, Pa., a coal mining town of 4,900 southwest of Pittsburgh, was 
buried under 33 inches of snow -- so much that plows had nowhere left to push 
it.

FRANCE MAY LIMIT ARTIFICIAL PREGNANCIES; MEDICINE: CONTROLS SOUGHT BY 
GOVERNMENT WOULD BE AMONG WORLD'S STRICTEST. 'WE WANT TO STAY VERY CLOSE TO 
NATURE,' ONE OFFICIAL SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 France's conservative government said Wednesday that it will seek to impose 
strict controls on artificial impregnation, including a requirement that 
infertile couples have the consent of the sperm donor and a judge's permission 
before receiving an embryo implant. 
</P>
<P>
 The government was spurred by a growing national debate this week following 
the birth of twins to a 59-year-old, post-menopausal British woman, who 
received an embryo implant at an Italian clinic. The doctors who did that 
implant say a 62-year-old Italian woman, Rosana Della Corte, now is three 
months pregnant after a similar treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 A bill that easily passed France's National Assembly a year ago, and awaits 
approval by the Senate, calls for a ban on embryo implants for women after 
menopause. But the new package of bills, if approved, will subject couples 
seeking artificial impregnation in France to some of the world's toughest 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in a situation where the state has to take its responsibilities," said 
Prime Minister Edouard Balladur. 
</P>
<P>
 The prime minister's spokesman, Nicolas Sarkozy, said Balladur knew the issue 
would be controversial and "that all efforts to legislate in such complex, 
touchy and changing areas must be made in a spirit of great intellectual 
modesty." 
</P>
<P>
 The government's plans were revealed by Social Affairs Minister Simone Veil 
after the Cabinet's regular weekly meeting. She told her fellow ministers that 
medical advances in assisted procreation and transplants have made stricter 
rules necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to stay very close to nature," Veil said. "But one must introduce 
some kind of framework, without stopping all women from benefiting from medical 
progress and having children when they wish if they are sterile." 
</P>
<P>
 Veil said the government plans to fine-tune the medical ethics bill that the 
National Assembly passed earlier before submitting it to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The new laws would impose new barriers to artificial insemination and embryo 
implantation, especially in cases where there are no biological links between 
the embryo and the couple who receive it. Under the government's proposals, a 
judge would be asked to consider a variety of factors in each case, including 
the biological connection of the embryo to the prospective parents and whether 
the sperm donor consented to the procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 The package of legislation already approved by lawmakers would allow 
"medically assisted procreation" only to remedy sterility or to avoid the 
transmission of disease to the child. It could not be used for women without 
partners, homosexuals or women past menopause. 
</P>
<P>
 Although analysts foresee a lively debate in Parliament, they say the 
government majority is likely to prevail unless it is persuaded to withdraw the 
legislation. And even a restrictive law in France, doctors say, would not 
prevent French couples from seeking treatment in other European countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading French doctors are divided on the proposed law. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacques Testart, head of one of France's leading in vitro research 
laboratories, said the ability "to totally change our way of living is a daring 
gesture that belongs, not to medicine, but to politics in its noble sense." 
</P>
<P>
 But Claude Sureau, a member of the French National Academy of Medicine and 
president of the ethics committee of the International Federation of Gynecology 
and Obstetrics, said, "I don't think a law forbidding such things is good. 
</P>
<P>
 "How does one define the normal age of menopause?" he asked. "And if one 
allows the law to interfere in such a private domain, one is in a dangerous 
ethical situation of genetic totalitarianism."

 Federal health officials said Wednesday that they are reviewing a Bush 
Administration decision to prohibit the medical use of marijuana, but they 
stressed that their action does not necessarily mean the ban will be lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Philip Lee, assistant secretary for health at the Department of Health and 
Human Services, said that the Administration agreed to take another look at the 
ban after being asked to do so by several members of Congress, including Rep. 
Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles), chairman of the House Energy and Commerce 
subcommittee on health and the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The review is in keeping with the practices of regularly reviewing policies 
and procedures but does not signal a change in the current policy, nor imply 
that current policy will be reversed," Lee said in a statement. One health 
official called the process "fairly routine." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the issue could further fuel the uproar created by Surgeon 
General Joycelyn Elders, when she suggested in recent remarks that the question 
of making drugs legal deserves more study. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1976 until 1992, the federal government allowed a small number of 
individuals on a case-by-case basis to take marijuana for medicinal purposes. 
These included relieving the nausea and appetite loss that is often a side 
effect of cancer and AIDS therapy, easing muscle spasms associated with spinal 
cord injuries or multiple sclerosis and lessening eye pressure in those 
suffering from glaucoma. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a March, 1992, ruling, the Bush Administration discontinued the 
program, saying that the drug's therapeutic value was unproven and that it 
could cause harm to some patients. Its use has been associated with lung 
ailments and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, about 15 patients were taking the illegal drug under the special 
program and were allowed to continue. But hundreds of others who had applied 
for permission were denied. 
</P>
<P>
 William Ruzzamenti, director of congressional and public affairs for the Drug 
Enforcement Administration, insisted Wednesday that -- despite the current 
review -- a reversal of the 1992 decision is not likely at this time. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kevin Zeese, vice president and counsel for the Drug Policy Foundation, a 
private nonprofit education organization, urged the Clinton Administration to 
move quickly to end the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time we stopped making criminals out of seriously ill Americans by 
denying them a medicine that obviously helps," Zeese said. "The ban on medical 
marijuana is inconsistent with the research of marijuana's effectiveness and 
inconsistent with the feelings of patients and doctors throughout the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Marijuana is classified under federal law as a Schedule 1 drug, meaning that 
it has a high potential for abuse and has no acceptable medical uses in the 
United States. Nor is it considered safe for medical purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, some studies have found a certain measure of support within the 
medical community for its medicinal use. A 1991 Harvard University-sponsored 
study, for example, found that 40% of U.S. cancer specialists surveyed 
recommended that their patients smoke marijuana to relieve chemotherapy-induced 
nausea and 48% said that they would prescribe it in certain cases if the drug 
were legal. 
</P>
<P>
 At this time, the American Cancer Society does not support marijuana use for 
cancer patients to relieve the nausea associated with chemotherapy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are other medications just as effective that will not have the side 
effects of marijuana," said a Cancer Society official. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the society, two forms of marijuana have been used to treat the 
side effects of chemotherapy: cigarettes and compounds related to the active 
chemical constituent of marijuana taken orally. One such compound currently 
available by prescription is dronabinol (Marinol), a synthetic form of the 
active marijuana constituent delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). 
</P>
<P>
 Smoking marijuana cigarettes can result in other problems, such as lung 
damage, the Cancer Society official said. Furthermore, many cancer experts 
believe that dronabinol, the oral medication, is not as effective as other 
drugs or drug combinations in controlling nausea and vomiting. It is not well 
absorbed by some patients and can cause a "high" that "may be unpleasant for 
elderly patients and those inexperienced in marijuana use," she said.

STATE OF THE STATE; 'CALIFORNIA IS WHERE CONTINENT ENDS AND FUTURE BEGINS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Excerpts of Gov. Pete Wilson's State of the State speech to the Legislature:  
</P>
<P>
 Last year, gridlock gave way to progress. In one of the most productive 
legislative sessions in history, we united in common purpose to promote job 
creation, to remake welfare and to pass a budget on time. Newcomers and old 
lions joined together to make a difference. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Without the reforms we have made to workers' comp, without reforms creating 
investment incentives and cutting red tape, businesses would continue to flee 
our state -- taking jobs with them. But we did make those important changes. We 
have reversed that flow of non-defense jobs out of California. More and more, 
the announcements these days are good news of new companies and new jobs for 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 If we hadn't made tough decisions to cut spending, our budget would still be 
on autopilot growth. It would be nearly $16 billion higher than it is today. 
That would be $1,300 more in taxes for the average California taxpayer. But we 
did hold the line on spending, to create more growth. 
</P>
<P>
 And if we hadn't begun to reform welfare, the system would still penalize 
those who choose the dignity of a job over the dependency of welfare. But we 
did reform welfare to finally make work pay. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, we must continue moving forward, continue building a better future 
for California. It's a future whose only limits are those of our own 
imagination, hopes and tenacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Let us not forget, after all, what California is. We aren't just another 
state. California is the place where the continent ends and the future begins. 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 The most urgent questions facing us are: How do we accelerate job creation? 
And how do we slam the brakes on violent crime? The questions are very much 
related. New jobs and safe streets are the twin pillars on which we must build 
California's future. But employers don't bring or even keep jobs in 
neighborhoods that are no longer safe for their customers' workers. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 We must move on three fronts to make California safe from crime. 
</P>
<P>
 First, we need to put more police on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, we need to do all we can to prevent children from ever turning to 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 And finally, to those criminals who are the most serious threat to society, we 
must send a clear and certain message: California is through with 
revolving-door justice. You have to say and mean that if you commit a crime, 
you're going to do serious time. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight I propose sending more police officers to those communities especially 
hard hit by violent crime. We'll recruit and train 500 new California Highway 
Patrol officers and place them in high-crime areas to fight crime with local 
law enforcement officials. To the criminal on the street our answer will be the 
cop on the beat. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 We must enforce a simple rule: Father a child -- support that child. 
</P>
<P>
 We sympathize with those neglected children who are tempted by gangs or drugs. 
But when as teen-agers or adults they victimize others, then our sympathy must 
yield to responsibility. And our first responsibility must always be to protect 
the innocent, and punish the guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 We must prosecute as adults perpetrators of vicious, violent crime at age 14, 
and above. 
</P>
<P>
 To make our streets safe again, we must target the most dangerous criminals. 
Research shows us that most serious crimes are committed by relatively few 
habitual criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Allen Davis is the most recent example. Davis has confessed to the 
tragic murder of little Polly Klaas. Davis is a repeat felon, a career criminal 
with a long, long record of habitual sordid crimes and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 This animal . . . should never have been at large on the streets of 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, in California more than 400 children were murdered. Our streets are 
being stained with the blood of our children -- and it's got to stop. Damn it, 
it has got to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 So I ask you, please, work with me to pass tougher laws. We know what 
California needs to make our cities, our suburbs, and our small towns safe 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who commit forcible rape, who molest a child, or devastate a 
community through arson, the first offense should be the last. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Arsonists and sexual predators are habitual offenders. What we need for them 
is a simple law: One strike, you're in -- for life. In good conscience, how can 
we risk releasing them to claim another victim, to traumatize another life? 
</P>
<P>
 . . . . Law-abiding citizens have the right to a weapon for self-defense. 
Criminals do not. But they are not deterred by a three-year sentence. A repeat 
felon with a gun is a new tragedy waiting to happen. Don't let it happen. Give 
him life . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 We need to ensure that all dangerous criminals serve more of the time to which 
they're sentenced. For the last three years I've demanded that we slash 
good-time credits that allow criminals to walk free -- routinely serving only 
half their sentence. Even murderers can now subtract one-third of their 
sentence for good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 That's an outrage. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 As governor, I've opened five new prisons. Tonight I propose that we offer $2 
billion worth of bonds to build six more. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be those who protest such costs. They'll complain that they would 
prefer to spend the money on higher education rather than more prisons. So 
would I. But this cost is not a matter of choice. The cost of California's 
failure to keep Richard Allen Davis behind bars was paid by Polly Klaas. Does 
anyone want to tell how much a child's life is worth? 
</P>
<P>
 Does anyone want to assign a dollar value to the lives of 400 murdered 
children? 
</P>
<P>
 We can -- we must -- prevent these crimes by building the prisons we need to 
put violent criminals away and changing the law to see that they go there and 
stay there long enough to protect society. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight I propose a $1,000 tax credit for each new job up to 100 jobs created 
by a start-up business during a two-year period beginning July 1. I say, let's 
reward those Californians who have the guts to start a new business and put our 
people back to work . . . . 
</P>
<P>
 We're opening one-stop shops so that getting the permits needed to create new 
jobs doesn't become a job in itself. The first two shops have opened in Los 
Angeles and Orange County. Four more will soon follow and we intend to create 
them all over California. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Too often our regulations protecting our air overlap with our regulations 
protecting our water, and both overlap with still more regulations. This 
redundant process wastes time, raises prices and kills jobs. It's not the 
standards that are the problem, it's the process. We're going to develop a plan 
with the Conservation Foundation to consolidate these regulations. We're going 
to insist they make sense. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 So tonight I propose expanding our marketing efforts in Mexico and doubling 
our export financing program. Let's help California companies take full 
advantage of NAFTA in entering the Mexican market and creating new jobs at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 My Administration will be holding "How to Export to Mexico" seminars around 
the state. We'll be working with California farmers and ranchers, high-tech 
entrepreneurs and engineers, working to find new markets for California 
products and California produce around the world. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just that further defense cuts are idling aerospace workers. Federal 
water cuts are squeezing our farmers. A failed immigration policy is busting 
our budget. And higher federal taxes are pinching our wallets. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, we've been cutting the cost of state government. In the past 
two years, we've reduced General Fund spending by $4 billion. We've abolished 
111 unnecessary boards and commissions. We've left 22,000 state jobs unfilled 
and saved a billion and a half dollars in welfare costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, I ask you to join me in making government even more efficient by 
abolishing the Energy Commission and the Integrated Waste Management Board and 
by trimming middle management in state government by 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, while we were cutting the cost of government in Sacramento, 
Washington was passing a tax hike that hit California taxpayers harder than 
taxpayers in 45 other states. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Well, for middle-class taxpayers, instead of a hike, I say we give 'em a 
break. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, I propose that, for California taxpayers earning less than 
$40,000 who will pay higher taxes under the Clinton tax plan, we reduce income 
taxes by an average of 19% for single taxpayers, 18% for joint filers. 
</P>
<P>
 In fairness, it will offset the federal tax hike for the 4.2 million taxpayers 
who can least afford to pay. . . .

JUDGE DELAYS LAND SWAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Department of Interior administrative judge has halted a land swap by the 
Bureau of Land Management that is necessary for the development of a huge 
garbage dump east of Palm Springs that would serve much of Southern California 
for 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge David L. Hughes ordered a stay on the land exchange because of a pending 
appeal to the Interior Department by opponents of the Eagle Mountain landfill, 
located near Desert Center, who contend that the dump would cause irreparable 
harm to the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes ordered that the appeal be expedited but noted in his ruling that 
critics of the landfill showed merit in challenging the land exchange between 
the land management bureau and Kaiser Resources and Mine Reclamation Corp., 
co-developers of the dump. 
</P>
<P>
 In his ruling, issued Tuesday in Arlington, Va., Hughes said that the bureau 
action contained procedural flaws, and that he found "serious, substantial, 
difficult and doubtful questions" about the land exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The land swap, approved by the land management officials in October, gave 
Kaiser 3,481 acres of bureau land at the former open-pit iron ore mine and 
permission to haul garbage by railroad across government lands in exchange for 
giving the bureau nearly $140,000 and 2,846 acres that is considered valuable 
for the preservation of the desert tortoise.

SCOTT HARRIS: A RANDOM ACT OF MOONING; KAREN, IT SEEMS, ISN'T JUST A DRIVE-BY 
MOONER. SHE MIGHT BE CONSIDERED A SERIAL MOONER.

<TEXT>
<P>
 It happened late on the night of Dec. 12. It was, my friends explained, a 
special occasion -- Megan's 40th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, I don't know Megan. But I do know Mike and Karen. They are, by all 
appearances, a perfectly respectable, responsible couple. They are raising 
three usually charming children in a handsome home in Studio City. They are 
intelligent and personable. You'd like them. Really. 
</P>
<P>
 But by now they are squirming. By now they are thinking they should have kept 
their mouths shut. By now they are turning red, wondering what the neighbors 
might think. 
</P>
<P>
 But the public has a right to know what happened late on the night of Dec. 12 
on Moorpark Avenue between Colfax and Laurel Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They offered their confession the other night at a small dinner party. Paul 
and Debbie heard them, and so did John and Kyrstin. And yours truly. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Karen explained, a few friends went out to celebrate Megan's birthday. 
They laughed and drank in her honor. And then they drank some more. 
</P>
<P>
 They traveled in two cars. No doubt there were designated drivers. On the ride 
back from the restaurant, Karen, sitting in the back seat with her husband, 
suddenly became inspired. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get out of the way!" she told Mike. 
</P>
<P>
 She climbed over him as Mike, puzzled, scooted aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as their car pulled alongside the other, Karen bared her derriere and 
positioned it at the passenger window. 
</P>
<P>
 Think of it as the moon over Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, mooning is only meaningful if its targets are indeed moonstruck. You 
can't be a mooner unless there's a moonee. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Karen got her butt out of the way, Mike looked over into Megan's car. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were just doubled over with laughter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only later did Mike learn that Megan's husband had assumed that it was Mike, 
not Karen, who had done the deed. 
</P>
<P>
 Of this much, Mike seemed embarrassed. But you know what they say about 
married people: Over the years, they start to look alike. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But confession really isn't the right word. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen, though she sought to blame demon rum, seemed pleased with herself. 
Although Mike was a bit disturbed that a man would confuse his wife's backside 
for his own, it was obvious he was proud of the mother of his children. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember the '70s? Mike asked. Those were the glory days of mooning and its 
silly cousin, streaking. That was when Mike and Paul were living in Anchorage, 
Alaska. Mike grew nostalgic, telling tales of a scientist friend who had 
mastered the art. Lockheed conceived the stealth bomber; this guy conceived the 
stealth moon. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd be at a crowded party, talking to somebody, and he'd moon you without 
anybody else knowing!" Mike said in awe. 
</P>
<P>
 Another time, Mike remembered, the scientist mooned a tour bus loaded with 
senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike and Paul acknowledged they did their share, but their feats were more 
modest. Paul remembered mooning a crowd on a street in Paris. The French, he 
explained, had been rude. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen said she had mooned people only on two previous occasions -- and that 
was way back when. 
</P>
<P>
 "Careful," Mike cautioned her. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul was smiling. It was obvious that Karen had forgotten the time she mooned 
Paul. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen, it seems, isn't just a drive-by mooner. She might be considered a 
serial mooner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That night, I couldn't offer much to the conversation. Mooning, as perpetrator 
or victim, hasn't been a big part of my life. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of our crack library staff, however, I can now report that 
historian Lincoln Diamant, author of "Early Mooning in America," contends that 
mooning -- described as "the contemptuous baring of the buttocks" -- is a 
Native American practice. European explorers, Diamant says, took it home along 
with such other discoveries as corn, potatoes and tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within half a century of Columbus' landing on San Salvador," he wrote, "the 
literate population of Europe was adding New World mooning to its broad arsenal 
of uncivilized rejoinder." 
</P>
<P>
 And as my Times colleague Jack Smith reported in January, 1989, this grand 
American tradition has been since celebrated by many people, including a Los 
Angeles attorney who owns the license plate MOONEM.  
</P>
<P>
 "The response from passersby has been nothing but positive," he told Smith, 
requesting anonymity. "I daily receive at least one honk and 'thumbs up' from a 
freeway neighbor and, occasionally, a friendly 'moon' from more gregarious 
comrades in fun." 
</P>
<P>
 So it seems that what was once an "uncivilized rejoinder" may now be regarded 
as a "gregarious" kind of greeting. 
</P>
<P>
 But just to be sure, I called the Los Angeles Police Department -- not to rat 
on anybody, but to ask whether mooning is indecent exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it would depend on whose backside you're looking at," Lt. John Dunkin 
suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunkin made it clear that, given L.A.'s troubles these days, mooning isn't a 
big priority of Chief Willie L. Williams. Another officer expressed doubts 
whether the city attorney would file charges. 
</P>
<P>
 So Karen, still on the loose, should be safe. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you happen to get mooned, just remember what the Bible says. 
</P>
<P>
 Turn the other cheek. 
</P>

LOVES ME, LOVES ME NOT!; BEEN JILTED IN LOVE? THIS HIS-AND-HERS GUIDE TO 
SURVIVING THE DEPTHS OF 'THE DUMP ZONE' MAY BE JUST THE ANTIDOTE YOU NEED.;

OBJECTS.

Angeles office of People magazine.

<P>
 Remember those movies where this guy (usually with a necklace fashioned from 
femur bones) shoves his hand into another guy's chest, rips out his heart and 
starts munching on it, ventricle by ventricle? The victim lets out this scream, 
his eyes spin around, all this stuff shoots out of his nose and then he dies 
horribly. 
</P>
<P>
 If you ask me, he got off pretty easy. 
</P>
<P>
 At least he didn't have to listen to garbage from his girlfriend like: "I 
really hope this won't affect our friendship," or "If you had let me eat your 
heart sooner, this never would have happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Greetings from the Dump Zone -- the land where we guy cast-offs in the game of 
love dwell. It's really not such a bad place. On good days we mope around in 
our boxers, gingerly probing the gaping hole in our chests with our fingers. On 
bad days we read Leo Buscaglia or Norman Vincent Peale, stare at old snapshots 
and rock back and forth. 
</P>
<P>
 She and I had been going out for just about forever when she decided to shed a 
few unsightly pounds by dropping me for a lighter guy. 
</P>
<P>
 Since I never could find a listing for a lobotomist in the Yellow Pages, I had 
no other option but to mine all the really deep and twisted thoughts swirling 
around in my head. Slowly, instead of wallowing in self pity, there arose in me 
a deep desire to help my fellow dumpees. In other words, I decided to milk my 
personal tragedy for everything it was worth. 
</P>
<P>
 What follows are 10 helpful hints practically guaranteed to allow you to 
"round the corner" (see Tip 5) and embark on one of the limited lifestyle 
possibilities open to guy dump victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Tip 1: For the first three to 48 months, stay very far away from country 
music, especially if you have access to sharp, pointed objects. (Bonus Tip: If 
you happen to notice that Valentine's Day is looming near, slip into a coma for 
two or three weeks.) 
</P>
<P>
 Tip 2: In conversation don't be tempted to use you-know-who's name or "my 
ex-girlfriend." Instead, refer to her as the Dark One; She Beast; Cruella, the 
Archfiend, or 
She-in-Whose-Womb-Surely-Dwells-a-Colony-of-Dysfunctional-Sea-Monkeys. 
</P>
<P>
 Tip 3: Have the U.S. Postal Service put a mail-block on your address. This 
will help prevent your sending a certain someone the horrifically scathing 
letter that even your mother says she deserves. A mail-block could save you 
upward of, let's say, $842 in UPS charges when the by-now psychotically enraged 
you-know-who sends all your belongings to you C.O.D. 
</P>
<P>
 Tip 4: The 122nd time your well-meaning friends use the word "process," as in 
"Gee, Johnny, you must process all those feelings," make the veins in your neck 
bulge out, make a fist and announce: "Hey, buddy, process this, why don'tcha." 
That'll be the last time they butt into your business. 
</P>
<P>
 Tip 5: Post-dump existence requires the ability to comprehend metaphors. 
"Rounding the corner" is another phrase you may hear quite often as in "The 
first step in rounding the corner is to find the metaphorical keys to the 
proverbial car." This can sometimes be tough since Ms. Sunshine probably gave 
them to her new beau. Anyhow, once you get the car running, so to speak, gun 
the engine and drive like hell. When you finally spot that allegorical corner, 
slam on the brakes, crank the steering wheel and go into a power slide. If 
you're lucky, you'll slam into a gasoline tanker truck and there'll be this 
real cool explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Tip 6: To calculate just how long you'll need to round the corner, figure on 
it taking half the time you spent in the relationship. To determine how that 
corresponds to beer consumption (a post-dump necessity), use this simple 
formula: Number of beers (number of years in relationship + ex-girlfriend's 
weight) x 365,000. (For mixed drinks, use the same formula, only divide 
ex-girlfriend's weight by alcohol proof.) 
</P>
<P>
 Tip 7: Avoid the Rebound Syndrome, especially if it involves a female wrestler 
named Chocko. Possible exceptions to that rule can be made for Kathy Ireland, 
Heidi the Tool Time Girl on "Home Improvement," and Trixie from "Speed Racer." 
</P>
<P>
 Tip 8: During those inevitable telephone tiffs following D-Day, remember to 
get the most out of your receiver. Don't be tempted to simply slam down the 
phone whenever the conversation turns pathetically ugly -- which it inevitably 
will. Do that and all she'll hear is an insipid little click, hardly the 
eardrum-splitting explosion the situation warrants. Solution: Connect an 
industrial-grade air horn to a stadium-size amplifier and wait for the 
appropriate moment. You'll probably only get one chance, so timing is 
important. 
</P>
<P>
 Tip 9: Smile at life and it smiles back at you. Scowl at life and even sneer a 
little, and women come out of the woodwork. Before you know it, they will be 
buying you Alfa Romeos and paying for your beer. I'm not really sure if this 
works, but I overheard two guys in an elevator swear it happened to one of 
their buddies. 
</P>
<P>
 Tip 10: Always ignore those post-dump survival-tip lists. The only people they 
remotely help are the hacks who write them and the bank accounts they love. 
Deep down, they are no doubt praying that you-know-who will read it, decide 
she's made a mistake and then, two or three months later, she'll extricate that 
heart all over again. Only this time, instead of her hands, she'll use a 
bazooka. Jeez, some guys never learn.

<TEXT>
<P>
 When I was first asked to write an article about how women get over a broken 
heart, I figured it would be the easiest money I ever made. Are you ready? 
</P>
<P>
 We don't. 
</P>
<P>
 Thank you, you've been a beautiful audience. Good night. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, well, since they are paying me, I guess we'll have to delve a little 
further. Actually, mine would have been the second shortest article written, 
next to "What Men Know About Women." 
</P>
<P>
 But enough about men. What about us? 
</P>
<P>
 You see, the problem when men dump women is there's usually someone younger, 
thinner and blonder involved. See: Trump, Marla. She looked great at the 
wedding, didn't she? Must be all that social climbing. You're welcome, Ivana.  
</P>
<P>
 This is what sends women into the futile but time-honored female post-dump 
tradition of dying our hair and trying to lose 20 pounds to either become the 
cellulite-free woman he dumped us for, or in the vain hope that he will come 
back on his stupid, bony little knees, whereupon we will spurn him and make him 
gnash his teeth in testosterone hell for all eternity. But at least we're not 
bitter. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't get me wrong. I don't want to get married anyway . . . I've got cable. 
And at least he programmed my VCR before he left. I just wish men came with 
remote, so you could just sit there and go: "Fix my car, have sex, kill the 
mouse, buy me a diamond." 
</P>
<P>
 But after some macho knuckle-dragger drop kicks your heart through the goal 
posts of life, you just go through that nagging feeling for a while that you've 
misplaced something, don't you? "Honey, have you seen my dignity? Oh, there it 
is, under your shoe with my self-respect. I'll get it. Oh, look. What's in your 
sock drawer? Hon, it's my pride and my sense of self-worth. I've been looking 
everywhere for those!" 
</P>
<P>
 And then they always say something totally heinous afterward. My last 
boyfriend actually said, "Yes, but didn't you learn a lot from this?" 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, that you're Satan. Thanks for asking, Pig-Man. 
</P>
<P>
 So, when it looks like you're in that final, pre-dump phase of the 
relationship, you know, when he starts using your diaphragm as an ashtray or 
for Christmas he gives you a smoke alarm . . . with a snooze button . . . it's 
time to pull out this handy little 10-tip primer for getting over him: 
</P>
<P>
 Tip 1: When in doubt, shop. Preferably, with one of his credit cards. Trust 
me, the Beverly Center on a sale day can easily substitute for years of 
therapy. A note of caution: Make sure this never works the other way. I once 
had a boyfriend clean out my entire bank account. Bonus tip: Give a man 
anything -- your heart, your soul, your body . . . but do not ever give him 
your PIN number. 
</P>
<P>
 Tip 2: I cannot actually condone any actual Bobbitt-like behavior, but you can 
avoid jail time and still get some aggression out by vigorously chopping 
cucumbers, carrots or, for a little more realism, some Italian sausage. 
</P>
<P>
 Tip 3: Just to remind yourself of all that you're missing with your 
ex-beloved, sit down in your den with a whoopee cushion and a six-pack, with a 
football game blaring on the TV, and ignore yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 Tip 4: Empower yourself. Blast "I Will Survive" or "I Am Woman" from your 
stereo at around 7,000 decibels, and realize that you have just stopped being 
Nice Little Broken-Hearted Doormat Girl and become . . . She-Rag, Princess of 
PMS. 
</P>
<P>
 Tip 5: Do not turn on any of those "lite" radio stations. You may as well just 
rip your heart out now and throw it into the car-pool lane of the San Diego 
Freeway. After a while, any song can do it to you. "The Candy Man can. Yes, the 
Candy Man Can . . . " "Oh, God," you wail, "he used to eat candy, ahahahahaha . 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
 Tip 6: When in doubt, eat Haagen-Dazs. Lots of it. In fact, I often inhale 
20-ton drums of it nasally if I'm in severe enough pain. Of course, this also 
leads to enough Oreos, Pop Tarts, potato chips, Doritos and enough peanut M&Ms 
to choke a moose, thereby shattering my dream of achieving that love-goddess 
body, which will undoubtedly lure His Shallowness back to me. But, hey. The 
hell with it. He's gone so I'm goin' for the sugar coma. 
</P>
<P>
 Tip 7: Become a nun. It's a little extreme, but I think all breakups 
essentially occur over religious differences, don't they? He thinks he's God; 
you don't. 
</P>
<P>
 Tip 8: Don't be afraid to wallow. It's like emotional fire-walking. Drink 
wine, play "your song" over and over and cry until you look like E.T. You can 
always use the practice for when you need to get out of your next speeding 
ticket. In fact, why not throw in a bikini wax or two and some unnecessary root 
canal work? 
</P>
<P>
 Tip 9: Keeping in mind that I don't advocate alcohol use or promiscuity, there 
is something to be said for downing a case of Lowenbrau and going down to the 
docks and waiting for a fleet of sailors to pull in. 
</P>
<P>
 Tip 10: Call him about a thousand times a day and hang up when he answers. 
This won't make you feel better, but you know you're going to do it anyway, so 
go ahead. Remember, you're only young once, but you can be immature forever. 
</P>
<P>
 And finally, rest assured that as soon as you meet someone new, you will do 
this all again. And we think salmon's mating habits are stupid.

CULTURE WATCH; POSTAL CHANGES SEEK SECURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to make it a bit easier for battered women to leave their troubles 
behind, the U.S. Postal Service this week announced two planned changes in its 
mail-forwarding system. 
</P>
<P>
 One change would prevent people from simply walking into a post office and 
finding out where someone has moved. 
</P>
<P>
 The other would block new address information of people protected by court 
orders from the system's address correction services. 
</P>
<P>
 "If both these changes result in one person or one family feeling safe, then 
I'm all for it," Postmaster General Marvin Runyon says. "Clearly, there are 
troubled individuals who could use our system of address changes for malicious 
purposes." 
</P>
<P>
 Two million to 4 million women are physically abused each year, the National 
Victim Center says. Domestic violence causes 100,000 days of hospitalization 
and 30,000 visits to hospital emergency rooms each year, the American Medical 
Assn. says. 
</P>
<P>
 Runyon says the new policies should take effect within six months.

 When Aliso Niguel High School in Aliso Viejo opened last fall, some students 
opted to leave Capistrano Valley High School for the new state-of-the-art (but 
still unfinished) facility. 
</P>
<P>
 So how are those students faring? It's a mixed bag, according to an article in 
the CVHS Times, the student newspaper at Capistrano Valley High. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like it. Nothing's ready. There is nowhere to sit at lunch and no 
cafeteria. I wish I never came here," one teen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like it because it seems like everyone knows everyone," said another. 
</P>
<P>
 "The facilities are nice but not completely ready. It's like Bill Clinton. All 
they do is promise and they don't perform," complained another.

Irvine.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Should America have laws restricting gun sales? The answer is yes. Guns are 
objects of violence, created by humans beings to take the life from other 
beings. 
</P>
<P>
 Guns enable any person to hold, in his or her hand, the power to end someone's 
existence forever. Humans were not meant to make that kind of decision, to have 
that kind of choice at their fingertips, to end lives at their fancy. But guns 
let people do just that. 
</P>
<P>
 Violence has become an epidemic that has swept our nation. Brutal crimes occur 
in every city, every day. The real question is, why don't we already have gun 
control? Why is it that anyone can go out and buy a gun? Is America so obsessed 
with the "rights of the people" that any person is allowed to go out and kill 
another person?  
</P>
<P>
 Of course not. Then why are guns so readily available throughout our nation? 
Guns are not essential for daily living. The most common reason for buying a 
gun is for protection. If there were fewer guns in the first place, people 
wouldn't have to arm themselves in defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The violence has even spread to our schools. Last year, there were thousands 
of incidents in the United States of students taking weapons to school. Kids. 
Not young adults or even adolescents, but children. 
</P>
<P>
 Schoolchildren should not have in their hands the means for slaying their 
classmates over simple disputes. In the past, a fistfight would have ended the 
quarrel; now a gun is the solution. Imagine what would happen if students shot 
each other every time there was a disagreement. No one would be left to attend 
class. Metal detectors, anyone? Hopefully, gun control would prevent firearms 
from ever reaching children. 
</P>
<P>
 America has become infamous throughout the world for its violence. Is it 
because Americans are more naturally violent and savage? No. It's because 
America is one of few nations where guns are free for all to own. Restricting 
the sales of both guns and bullets would be a great step toward ending 
violence. Gun control would be an effective method for diminishing violence 
because it would take away the object that gives someone the ability to kill 
with ease: the gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, gun control won't stop all the violence in our cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The real solution is to find the roots of violence and eradicate them. That 
would call for an end to racism, poverty and hate. Only in an utopian society 
can all violence truly be eliminated.  
</P>
<P>
 But while we're waiting, the least we can do is begin to reduce violence by 
implementing gun control.

OC HIGH / STUDENT NEWS AND VIEWS; VIDEO GAME REVIEW; GENERAL CHAOS; FOR SEGA 
GENESIS BY ELECTRONIC ARTS, $49.95  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM SCHIFFMANN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 War is hell, said Civil War Gen. William Tecumseh Sherman. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe not, says Electronic Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, with General Chaos, Electronic Arts has turned blood-and-guts combat 
into a cartoony brawl between small teams of really ugly handpicked soldiers 
serving either Gen. Chaos or his archrival, Gen. Havoc. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaos and Havoc were childhood buddies who played war games, collected 
military literature and pretty much prepared themselves for a career of 
bloodletting. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, Chaos found an old and valuable combat comic book and made the 
mistake of showing it to the greedy Havoc. They fought over the crumbling 
pages, finally ripping it to shreds. 
</P>
<P>
 Each blamed the other, and their friendship turned to hatred that eventually 
drove them to send armies of men into combat for revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Chaos serves the lovely land of Moronica, while Havoc plans and schemes 
for the rival town of Viceria. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not, however, your standard combat game. 
</P>
<P>
 The two generals have agreed to fight with small squads of men, and that's how 
you start the game. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as four players may take part, using EA's new 4-Way Play plug strip. 
The best way to start is in Boot Camp, where you get to practice your warrior 
skills: squad control, using weapons, close combat, medical staff and 
commandos. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it's off to war. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A map appears on the screen, and the army that won the last battle (or the 
blue army at the start of the game) selects the next battlefield. There 51 
battlefields. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, you choose a squad from four choices: assault team, demolition squad, 
brute force squad and commandos. Each five-man squad has its own skills and 
abilities; the commando squad is only two men and should be saved for special 
tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 There are five types of soldiers. The gunner uses a small machine gun; the 
chucker tosses hand grenades; the scorcher wields a flamethrower; the launcher 
has a bazooka, and the blaster tosses dynamite. 
</P>
<P>
 You watch the battle from overhead. At the start, your five men face a similar 
number of enemies. In a one-player game, the computer runs the red team, while 
you control the blue. 
</P>
<P>
 The D pad controls a cursor that you can position to move highlighted soldiers 
to make the best use of each soldier's abilities. Gunners can be placed further 
from the enemy than chuckers, who need to be close to hit the target with their 
grenades. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Keep your men on the move, and spread them out. If you hold still too long, 
you're a sitting duck. There are a limited number of medics available -- you 
can add to the total by collecting a medic icon on some battlefields -- to 
patch up the wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 But sooner or later, soldiers have to die. As your GIs are wasted, a small 
white skull appears in that soldier's slot in the information bar at the top of 
the screen. If your five die before Havoc's, you lose that round and Havoc 
picks the next battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
 Points are awarded for plunder collected, total acreage (each battlefield 
represents a certain number of acres) and casualties inflicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Graphics are good but not spectacular. One of the high points is the sound of 
weapons.  
</P>
<P>
 Planning is rewarded, and the more you play, the better you get at positioning 
the proper soldier in the proper place to waste Havoc's troops. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the game's few weak points, getting too close to an enemy soldier 
brings the battle to a halt while the two have a fistfight. Control is slow and 
blows seem to move through molasses. 
</P>
<P>
 That aside, this is an amazingly entertaining game. The gore level is very low 
-- nothing to damage even the most delicate psyche.

PASADENA'S MUSICAL CIRCUS IS A SHOWCASE FOR KIDS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Parents who envision their child as a soloist performing with a renowned 
symphony may come closer to making that dream a reality by participating in 
Pasadena Symphony Assn.'s "Musical Circus" on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The event gives children ages 4 to 10 a hands-on introduction to musical 
instruments -- from the violin to drums -- at Pasadena Civic Auditorium, 300 E. 
Green St. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers will demonstrate how to play the instruments and coach the 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most inspirational part of the program is the Showcase of Talent. 
Three child musical prodigies -- 9-year-old Christina To; Rachel Kim, 10, and 
John Novacek, now 29, will perform. 
</P>
<P>
 A question-and-answer session will follow the program, emceed by USC announcer 
Bonnie Grice. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the third year the symphony has offered the "Musical Circus." It will 
be held on the Saturday morning of each of its five concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 The next scheduled concerts are March 26 and April 30. Free. For information, 
call (818) 793-7172. LAURIE K. SCHENDEN

O.C. POP BEAT / MIKE BOEHM: MOVE OVER, SEATTLE; HERE COMES . . . UH-OH, REALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new year is a year as yet uncorrupted by reality. 
</P>
<P>
 So please indulge me while I use this brief respite to forget the facts and 
sneak in my vision of the ideal 1994 for the Orange County rock scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Reality really feasted on that scene during a dismal '93 of club closings and 
big-venue doldrums; perhaps it is momentarily sated, and therefore a little 
groggy. Let's all do a little dreaming before reality comes to its senses -- 
and forces us to come to ours. Please Bogart That Joint, My Friend . . .  
</P>
<P>
 When Bogart's closed in December, the local rock scene seemed ready for 
endless winter. With the Long Beach club went the only place in the immediate 
neighborhood where Orange County rock fans could find a steady, night-to-night 
diet of good local bands and cool, truly alternative national acts. 
</P>
<P>
 How foolish of us to think that Bogart's  
</P>
<P>
 enlightened booking policy and its patron's approach to fostering indigenous 
rock could not be duplicated at a time when the buck, having grown scarce, had 
become even more almighty than usual. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, a club management team did step forward that had a sharp 
enough head for business to turn a profit, yet was primarily interested in 
investing heart and soul in doing the right thing by the local rock scene. 
</P>
<P>
 That central club (unreality frees us momentarily from the need to provide 
such thorny details as names and places, but it seems as if this time the 
fulcrum of the Orange County scene was actually in the county) was only the 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 Grass-roots promoters, jolted into action by the Bogart's closing, began 
thinking bigger and making the most out of smaller, less-established venues. 
Even the big guys from Los Angeles, like Avalon Attractions and Goldenvoice 
Presents, got interested in bringing strong club-level talent to Orange County, 
using such halls as the Ice House in Fullerton and the re-established Rhythm 
Cafe in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With the neo-Bogart's as its new hub, and many satellite venues serving as 
spokes, the local scene quickly became a wheel on fire. Which led, by year's 
end, to: The Fall of the Orange Curtain 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody thinks that people down there are so conservative and ultra 
right-wing. It's got the Orange County stigma: 'How can these people rock?' But 
the fact is, these people are rocking, and they're good. They just never get a 
break." 
</P>
<P>
 That's how David Crowley, an O.C. expatriate turned Los Angeles music 
publicist and band manager, summed up the reality of rock life in his former 
haunts at the end of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The wider world didn't want to think about Orange County as a place of rock 
'n' roll vitality. You could point to Social Distortion and the rest of the 
maturing O.C. punk rock class of '79; you could note the consistently strong 
work done by local bands on the Orange-based Doctor Dream label; you could 
submit as evidence such accomplished and widely acclaimed roots-oriented 
performers as Walter Trout, Chris Gaffney, Jann Browne and James Harman. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it came to defining our image, the only Orange County names that 
seemed to matter to outsiders were John Birch, Robert Dornan and Mickey Mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 All that changed in the pivotal year of '94. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade and a half after the first volleys of the original O.C. punk boom 
were sounded, the local political establishment had finally gotten over its 
horror of little punkers running around causing mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
 In an era of drive-by shootings, slam-dancing and the occasional punk-related 
fistfight seemed pretty innocuous. And, heck, most of the county's young cops, 
not to mention the city council members' kids, were into Pearl Jam and Nirvana, 
like everybody else. 
</P>
<P>
 What had been seen as teen delinquency a few years before was now just teen 
spirit. Finally freed from the undue hostility of a tidiness-obsessed local 
officialdom that had undermined the scene as it tried to take shape in the 
1980s, rock clubs were able to flourish. 
</P>
<P>
 And the wider rock world, always on the hunt for the next hip new scene to 
tout, began to take notice. It helped that strong records by Joyride and the 
Cadillac Tramps won Doctor Dream a rep as a hot independent label. Debut 
releases by Eli Riddle and One Hit Wonder added to the snowball effect. Social 
Distortion arrived at midyear with an album that proved to be its long-expected 
breakthrough blockbuster. 
</P>
<P>
 But the scene's biggest rock hero was its oldest rock hero, Dick Dale. His 
first-ever video, a treatment of the searing surf-punk instrumental, "Nitro," 
took over MTV and left Beavis and Butt-head too awe-struck even to say 
"huh-huh, like, cool, heh-heh-heh." At 57, the surf-rock pioneer emerged as the 
world's unlikeliest alternative-music guitar god. 
</P>
<P>
 The young bands Water, Xtra Large and No Doubt also released major-label 
albums that enjoyed good reviews and strong sales. The rock world's pundits and 
plutocrats finally had to concede that there was a there there, after all, and 
they marveled that no two O.C. bands sounded remotely alike. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, it was there that, as far as alternative rock went, had more 
extensive historical roots than such previous '90s hot-and-trendy cities as 
Seattle and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 As Rolling Stone, Spin, Billboard and the rest did their big takeouts on the 
Orange County scene, the angle was consistent: how hardy, independent-minded 
souls had held out in some cases for more than a decade in an arid, 
overweeningly materialistic environment that was suburbia in excelsis ; how 
they had resisted the trend-crazed, so-you-wanna-be-a-rock-'n'-roll-star 
mentality of the great Hollywood machine to the north, and had continued making 
music full of integrity until the outer world finally started paying attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Visiting writers looked to sources such as Jonny Donhowe of Fluf, one of the 
leading bands on a San Diego rock scene that in 1993 had captured national 
notice and been the object of a feeding frenzy of contract-blandishing scouts 
from big labels. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always looked to Orange County (for punk influences)," Donhowe had said in 
an interview during the waning dark days of '93. "The Adolescents, Uniform 
Choice. When I was a kid, everyone I was into was from Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, label scouts were checking their freeway maps, trying to find their 
way to Fullerton. Hollywood's population dwindled slightly but noticeably as 
would-be rock careerists looked for affordable rents in Costa Mesa, Santa Ana 
and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Copies of "Adolescents," Social Distortion's "Mommy's Little Monster" and 
catalogue items from T.S.O.L., the Crowd, Agent Orange, Tender Fury, the 
Vandals, D.I. and the Pontiac Brothers were sought and coveted by 
alternative-rock cognoscenti the world over. One's hipness quotient was now 
measured in part by how hip one was to the history of O.C. rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran Orange County players and music fans thought they must be dreaming. 
The O.C. Hat Trick: Three Big Venues, Three Big Scores 
</P>
<P>
 To paraphrase Mark Twain, reports of the Pacific Amphitheatre's demise as a 
rock venue proved to be greatly exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of keeping it in mothballs for all but two weeks of the year, the new 
owners, the Orange County Fair, struck a deal with promoters eager to operate 
the Pacific as an all-purpose concert venue. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of going for the blockbuster shows, as it had in the past, the Pacific 
scaled back and concentrated on becoming the good, intimate concert theater 
Orange County had lacked -- a sort of Wiltern-under-the-stars. 
</P>
<P>
 It made its way with a strong schedule of acts that typically attracted 2,000 
to 6,000 fans. The likes of Elvis Costello, Tom Waits, Van Morrison, Lou Reed, 
Pete Townshend and David Byrne became the Pacific's steady fare. Perhaps the 
season's biggest highlight was a wonderful "unplugged" evening with Stevie 
Wonder. 
</P>
<P>
 And the place was gorgeous -- the Fair Board having used its horticultural 
connections to turn the vast but no-longer-needed lawn area into a lovely 
combination arboretum and sculpture garden with changing exhibits highlighting 
the botanical arts. 
</P>
<P>
 With its scaled-down layout, and its concentration on bands not committed to 
earsplitting volume, the Pacific's longstanding problems with noise-fearing 
neighbors were laid to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Meadows, meanwhile, became one of the most profitable concert venues in 
the country. No longer forced into auction bidding against the Pacific for the 
biggest names with the biggest draw, Irvine pulled in every giant attraction 
that came down the pike, from Pearl Jam to Tom Petty, to a multiple-night 
engagement by the record-setting Frankiepalooza tour. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the one in which Ol' Blue Eyes presided over a daylong, 
inter-generational bill of pop-standards that also included Tony Bennett, Ray 
Charles, Natalie Cole, Liza Minnelli, Linda Ronstadt, k.d. lang and Bono 
Hewson. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Arena became firmly established as an active, first-class hall for 
acts that wanted a roof over their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 What really put the building on the rock map was the "Week of the Dead" it 
staged in conjunction with Anaheim Stadium. For seven days, the two adjoining 
facilities and their parking lots became a huge but orderly Deadhead 
encampment, enlivened by side-stages featuring an array of old-line country, 
blues and roots-rock acts representing the Dead's stylistic sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dead, rock's biggest live draw, had been absent from Orange County since 
1990, when a large number of arrests at its annual Irvine Meadows concerts that 
year resulted in the group being declared "rock banda non grata" by city and 
amphitheater officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dead played three nights at the Arena, then three more at the Stadium, 
before capping the week with an unprecedented day-night Sunday doubleheader 
involving shows at each venue. The band donated the final day's take to Orange 
County's effective, nationally renowned anti-gang task force. 
</P>
<P>
 The week went so well that plans went ahead to make it an annual event, and 
wherever the Dead played for months afterward, Jerry Garcia could be seen on 
stage sporting a Mighty Ducks T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Under its new management, the Orange County Performing Arts Center bid adieu 
to past cultural snobbishness and worked in the occasional attractive 
adult-rock program. The center signaled this newfound openness and imagination 
with an acclaimed "Singers of Southern California" series that featured 
concerts by Jackson Browne, Bonnie Raitt, Don Henley and Linda Ronstadt. 
</P>
<P>
 In summary, the O.C. big-venue scene was transformed in '94 from one of 
cut-throat competition to one in which complementary concert facilities formed 
a perfect fit. Toss in the Coach House, with its usual varied lineup of shows, 
and local pop fans had so much good stuff from which to choose that the sparse 
days of '93 seemed almost unreal. Meanwhile, Back in the Real World 
</P>
<P>
 The local scene actually does have real musicians making real music that we 
can realistically expect to hear in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Social Distortion took most of 1993 off, although it did some scattered live 
shows and provided the backing music for a Nike television commercial featuring 
Dennis Hopper as a sports referee. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, reports main man Mike Ness, "I'm writing (what is) I think the best 
record I've ever written. . . . The last few records we showed everyone that we 
loved the blues, we loved country and rockabilly. This record I want to get 
back to my primary roots," which means a shot of straight, melodic punk. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole record is attitude. It's angry, it's aggressive, it's just how I 
feel right now," added Ness. He hopes that the band, which remains signed to 
Epic Records, will have finished recording by early spring, with a summer 
release to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Dale's "Tribal Thunder" album won him critical accolades in 1993 and led 
to his first extended national touring. The guitar great's first order of 
business for '94 is to make a video for the album's hot leadoff track, "Nitro." 
</P>
<P>
 In March, he expects to be back in the studio, recording his second album for 
the HighTone label with pretty much the same supporting crew that helped drive 
"Tribal Thunder." Also possible during the coming year are Dale's first-ever 
appearances overseas: He says he has an invitation to play a major summer 
festival in Holland. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Dale goes surfing off to other parts, local fans can catch him at the 
Coach House on Jan. 22. (The old-line surf-rock contingent might also want to 
circle Jan. 16, the day the Chantays play at Randell's in Santa Ana in 
celebration of the 30th anniversary of the release of their definitive 
surf-rock hit, "Pipeline.") 
</P>
<P>
 April in Switzerland, anyone? Besides the Alps, you'd be able to take in shows 
by Jann Browne and Chris Gaffney, O.C. country-music stalwarts who will share a 
backing band on a two-week European package tour. Browne has an album due out 
on a Swiss label, Red Moon. Gaffney, one of the most distinctive songwriters 
around, is the king of even numbers, having topped my O.C. 
best-albums-of-the-year list in both 1990 and 1992. He goes for the threepeat 
in '94, saying he is well along in writing material to be released on an 
independent label yet to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 The Walter Trout Band has another heavy year of travel ahead, including much 
work in Europe and its first dates in Australia, a continent where Trout 
established himself in previous blues gigs with Canned Heat and John Mayall. 
</P>
<P>
 And, at last, American audiences will have a chance to hear his potent, 
passionate blues-rock. Trout's first U.S. release, "Tellin' Stories," is 
already in the can following 1993 sessions in London. Look for a May release 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the blues beat, Robert Lucas will issue "Layaway," his fourth album 
for the San Clemente-based Audioquest label, and we can expect another Black 
Top release from the James Harman Band.  
</P>
<P>
 The promising young O.C. band Water starts the year with sessions in New 
Orleans for its debut album on MCA Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Having spent 1993 building its own home studio and writing some 40 to 50 new 
songs, the ska-flavored Anaheim rock band, No Doubt, plans to release its 
sophomore effort for Interscope Records. Albhy Galuten, whose past credits 
include working with the Bee Gees on the "Saturday Night Fever" soundtrack and 
a more recent album by Jellyfish, has already produced three tracks, reports No 
Doubt's Tony Kanal. 
</P>
<P>
 Having spent most of 1993 as the drummer in Paul Westerberg's touring band, 
wunderkind Josh Freese returns to Orange County to work on his debut solo album 
for Giant Records. He'll write, sing and play most of the instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 Freese remains a member of Xtra Large, which will be working on a follow-up to 
its 1992 debut album. Local punk-scene veteran Dave Quackenbush, best known as 
front man of the Vandals, has replaced Darren McNamee as Xtra Large's singer. 
Meanwhile, look for Xtra Large's guitarist, Warren Fitzgerald, to continue his 
moonlighting association with Oingo Boingo. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Grisham, one of the local scene's most active and flamboyant rockers 
since his wild early-'80s days with T.S.O.L., sang not a note in public during 
1993. But Grisham kept busy, working up new material with a new band. Geffen 
Records financed the sessions on a "development deal" basis, Grisham says. 
</P>
<P>
 While no formal record contract has been signed, Grisham and his new band, 
Joykiller, should surface soon with live gigs. The band includes Tracii Guns, 
of L.A. Guns, as well as alumni of the Weirdos, Gun Club, and Grisham's old 
band, Tender Fury. Look for a sound that, as Grisham puts it, is "hard but 
pretty at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 Cisco Poison, fronted by another T.S.O.L. alum, Joe Wood, expects to sign an 
independent-label deal in '94 and issue its debut album. . . . Cadillac Tramps 
are at work on their third album for Doctor Dream. . . . The hard-riffing San 
Diego/O.C. band Fluf also plans to release a new album and a flurry of vinyl 
singles. Fluf headlines Jan. 28 at Our House in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The roots-rocking Mystery Train plans a debut release on a Japanese label, 
EMI/Toshiba. The album is called "706 Union Avenue," the Memphis address of the 
old Sun Records studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Others who made favorable impressions in '93 and bear watching include Eli 
Riddle, which is readying a self-financed debut album; One Hit Wonder; Trip the 
Spring; Loaded (led by Burning Tree alumnus Mark Dutton); Big Sandy & His 
Fly-rite Boys; the punk-influenced Lidsville; Asight Unseen; and Gina Quartaro, 
a country-rock contender who is working with producer Jon St. James. The fact 
that the erstwhile synth-pop producer is now laying tracks with steel guitars 
speaks volumes about the ascendancy of country music. 
</P>
<P>
 As always, we embrace the unknown and the unpredictable, in hopes that along 
with the inevitable harsher realities will come the pleasant surprises that 
give us reason to keep on dreaming and peering around the corner for what comes 
next.

PAUL CONRAD DONATES ARCHIVE TO HUNTINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUZANNE MUCHNIC, TIMES ART WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paul Conrad, the three-time Pulitzer Prize-winning political cartoonist whose 
work has outraged and delighted readers of The Times for the past 30 years, has 
donated his archive to the Huntington Library in San Marino. 
</P>
<P>
 The gift consists of several thousand drawings and sketches for cartoons, 
created over the course of Conrad's career at the newspaper, from 1964 to the 
present. Subjects of the cartoons include U.S. Presidents, Los Angeles mayors, 
other political figures and social issues such as abortion and race relations. 
The artist also gave the Huntington his correspondence files including letters 
from public figures featured in his cartoons and from the public. "This is a 
major contemporary collection that will be available to researchers in the 
years ahead," Huntington Library Director William Moffett said in announcing 
the donation. "Conrad has done a very good job of keeping all his materials 
together, so we have a fairly comprehensive collection. It shows all the stages 
of preparing cartoons for the newspaper. He even saved his hate mail." 
</P>
<P>
 The Conrad archive will join what is probably the nation's largest historical 
collection of political cartoons, Moffett said, noting that the collection's 
strength has been 18th- and early 19th-Century British material. "We haven't 
been systematically collecting from the 20th Century, but Conrad's gift is a 
signal that we are willing to collect 20th-Century cartoons and caricatures," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The artist said he decided to give his collection to the Huntington for two 
reasons: "They asked, and I don't know of any place that is better equipped to 
take care of it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "They will de-acidify the roughs and the cartoons," Conrad said. "They gave me 
a tour of the place, and it was astounding. Once I saw what they can do to 
preserve things, I said, 'Why not?' I could break up the collection and give it 
to my kids, but they wouldn't know what to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
 In building a major collection of political cartoons, the Huntington has taken 
its cue from Herbert Hoover, who served as a trustee of the library in the 
1930s, Moffett said. "He was the butt of cartoons during his presidency and he 
continues to pop up as a symbol of the Depression. But on one occasion, when he 
spoke here, Hoover said he was delighted to find political cartoons in the 
collection because they help us understand political ideas and offer a window 
to public opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 Conrad, 69, was born, raised and educated in Iowa. He got his professional 
start at the Denver Post, where he was a cartoonist from 1950-64, and were he 
landed his first Pulitzer Prize in 1964. After then-publisher Otis Chandler 
recruited him for the Los Angeles Times, Conrad won Pulitzers in 1971 and 1984. 
He is also a three-time winner of the Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award, and 
has garnered several other prizes for his work. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he left his early work at the Denver newspaper, the Huntington will 
attempt to add that chapter of Conrad's production to the library's collection 
if the material can be located, Moffett said. The collection also is expected 
to grow as Conrad continues to produce drawings. 
</P>
<P>
 Conrad retired last year, having decided to "throttle back somewhat," as he 
put it, but his cartoons continue to be distributed by the the Los Angeles 
Times Syndicate and they appear twice a week in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huntington plans to put part of the Conrad collection on exhibition in 
1995, Moffett said.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: 'HOMICIDE' DESERVES ITS LATEST REPRIEVE; TELEVISION: THE 
COMPLEX AND DISTINCTIVE NBC SERIES GETS A FOUR-EPISODE LEASE ON LIFE AFTER 
FLOPPING LAST SEASON IN THE RATING, BUT THE ODDS ARE STACKED AGAINST IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Homicide: Life on the Street" returns at 10 tonight with a new lease on 
law-breakers, mingling gun power and Robin Williams' power at the end of NBC's 
biggest, most affluent evening in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
 Following last season's flop in the ratings, this four-episode reprieve (on 
Channels 4, 36 and 39) is surely the final chance for "Homicide." Its appeals 
are used up, the last meal is warming. If the ratings aren't good this time, 
there won't be another phone call from the governor a few seconds before the 
executioner throws the switch. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC's monthlong gift to "Homicide" executive producers Barry Levinson and Tom 
Fontana is the time slot behind a self-mocking comic and two effete shrinks and 
their cranky dad. What has been NBC's keystone combo of "Seinfeld" to "Fraser" 
to "L.A. Law" will now be "Seinfeld" to "Fraser" to "Homicide: Life on the 
Street," with the weakest of the previous trio getting temporarily benched. 
</P>
<P>
 If ever a series deserved another shot, it's "Homicide," whose view of urban 
America's carousel of miseries is complex and distinctive, one apart from ABC's 
own superior cop series "NYPD Blue." You want "Homicide" to streak and succeed 
on NBC's terms at 10 p.m., but logic tells you that it won't. 
</P>
<P>
 The odds are mightily against a crime drama that rejects the quickie cures 
that we ache for in these times when we're as apt to watch TV holding a can of 
mace as a can of Bud Light, when neighborhoods are increasingly war zones that 
transform houses and businesses into armed sentry posts. 
</P>
<P>
 Day after day, the news is filled with crime stories that have you muttering, 
"That shouldn't have happened." Yet irrational as they are, they do happen. 
Mimicking real life on the streets, little in tonight's script by David Simon 
and David Mills turns out as you'd want it to. An innocent tourist who 
shouldn't get slain does get slain, a youth who shouldn't be a perpetrator is a 
perpetrator, and the Baltimore cops who shouldn't be indifferent are 
indifferent.  
</P>
<P>
 You never see the violence. But so intimate and effective is the direction of 
Stephen Gyllenhaal ("A Dangerous Woman") that you feel it touching you as it 
touches the characters on the screen. 
</P>
<P>
 Performer Williams shares a checkered history with producer Levinson ("Good 
Morning, Vietnam" and "Toys"); whether Mrs. Doubtfire will torch "PrimeTime 
Live" on ABC and "Second Chances" on CBS as he did his foam breasts in the 
movie remains to be seen. But he affirms in this raw, scintillating episode 
what a fine dramatic actor he is.  
</P>
<P>
 Williams plays a man named Ellison who is visiting Baltimore with his wife and 
two kids when they're spotted by some street thugs. The next thing you know, 
the wife is dead and Ellison, looking as dazed as someone who gets clobbered 
with a Louisville Slugger and doesn't know why, is wearing her blood on his 
shirt and jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison wants to grieve; the police want to investigate. He objects when his 
son is questioned too aggressively. He objects when he finds his wife stretched 
out on a slab in the morgue minus her wedding band, dehumanized by her nudity. 
He objects when one of the cops working his case (Daniel Baldwin) seems callous 
and cynical. The captain (Yaphet Kotto) politely tells Ellison, "He's not going 
to feel what you feel; none of us are." 
</P>
<P>
 And no wonder, for unlike Ellison, they spend their hours nose to nose with 
the bodies "piling up around here," their routine dictated by a board listing 
homicides the way the hucksters in "Glengarry Glen Ross" are ruled by the sales 
board in their real estate office. 
</P>
<P>
 More than anything, Ellison is overcome by terrible, gnawing guilt, the 
feeling that he could have, should have, done something to save his wife. He 
pleads with one of the cops to let him hold his gun, and when he does handle 
it, he feels "the power" enter his fingers the way it did his wife's murderer, 
a kid with options in his life, but who nevertheless assured his own oblivion 
as soon as he pulled the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
 The naked city and its 8 million cycles of dysfunction rage in "Homicide." As 
does the race thing, with the captain (who is black) tonight wondering aloud 
whether the murdered young mother would have drawn as much attention had she 
been black instead of white ("How do you feel, Mr. Ellison?" shouts an idiot TV 
reporter fronting the media pack). 
</P>
<P>
 "Homicide" and ABC's hit "NYPD Blue" are cousins, if not close siblings. Their 
first-rate casts, hand-held cameras, quality writing and general intelligence 
are common denominators. And on both shows, the boss in the squad room is 
black. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There's infinitely more to "NYPD Blue" than the female nudity and blue 
utterances that initially rammed a white-hot poker up the blue noses of the 
show's most conservative critics. Its language remains coarse by network 
standards, but not gratuitously so. More significantly, its rule-bending Kelly 
(David Caruso) and Sipowicz (Dennis Franz) are an intriguing pair of detectives 
whose volatile personal lives compete for our attention each episode with a 
revolving door of crimes and other conflicts ranging from Mob hits to 
territorial battles within the department. It definitely holds your interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Homicide," on the other hand, has an alternate agenda, essentially following 
a one-crime-per-episode formula in which the police revolve around the case 
instead of vice versa. The result is more attention to the crime and the 
investigation than to the cop. 
</P>
<P>
 Or in tonight's episode, more wattage on the victim of the crime, and by 
extension, all of us who are watching. Says Ellison, speaking for the 
multitudes, "It's not 'Why me?' anymore. It's ' When me?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, "Homicide" doesn't attach easy answers to its questions about life 
and death in the 1990s. Nor will we know for a while whether its eloquent 
approach to storytelling will attract enough viewers to ensure its own survival 
beyond January.

A 'BRIEF' FLAP OVER SURPRISE ENDINGS; MOVIES: AFTER TWO PUBLICATIONS REPORTED 
ON A LATE-HOUR CHANGE TO THE CONCLUSION OF 'THE PELICAN BRIEF,' THE PERENNIAL 
QUESTION OF WHETHER TO REVEAL THE ENDINGS RESURFACES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY PRISTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the kind of story destined to make a studio publicist squawk. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Warner Bros.' "The Pelican Brief" was about to open in mid-December, 
both Newsday and Entertainment Weekly reported on an 11th-hour decision to 
change the film's ending. Both publications provided details about the 
thriller's closing scene, thereby infuriating Warners. 
</P>
<P>
 Attacking the stories as "bad journalism," Warners spokesman Robert G. 
Friedman said they could spoil moviegoers' experience of the film based on the 
best-selling John Grisham novel. 
</P>
<P>
 "To people who are unfamiliar with the book or don't remember it, the stories 
they wrote potentially diminish the suspense of the plot," he said last week. 
But some critics say the studio is making too much out of what is really just a 
coda to the film. 
</P>
<P>
 Although giving away an ending or major plot twist is almost certain to 
irritate readers, such disclosures are not at all rare -- and, according to 
some people, may be turning up with increasing frequency because of the 
heightened competition for entertainment news. 
</P>
<P>
 Reviewers, reporters and editors say they think twice before discussing 
endings and surprise developments, and would almost always refrain from doing 
so if writing about a plot-driven thriller. But some maintain it is sometimes 
impossible to intelligently analyze a film without fully telling what it's 
about. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as the experience with "The Crying Game" demonstrates, critics and 
journalists occasionally go to great lengths to remain mum for the sake of 
audiences' enjoyment. Egged on by Miramax Films, the movie's distributor, many 
news outlets kept Jaye Davidson's sex a secret until after he was nominated for 
a supporting actor Oscar. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics find the studios' bellyaching disingenuous, given how much is 
revealed these days in trailers. "I wonder now why anybody complains, when the 
coming attractions give you all the dramatic scenes from beginning to end," 
said Andrew Sarris, film critic for the New York Observer. 
</P>
<P>
 The trailer for the current movie "Shadowlands," however, gives no hint to the 
fate of poet Joy Gresham (Debra Winger). Reviewers say this is just the type of 
secret they are not obliged to keep. The late-in-life romance of Gresham and 
writer C. S. Lewis was first dramatized as a BBC television production and then 
became a Broadway play. 
</P>
<P>
 Time magazine critic Richard Corliss draws a distinction between "Shadowlands" 
and "Terms of Endearment" (1983), in which "a big dramatic shift comes 90 
minutes into the movie," he said. "You don't want to deprive people of 
surprises." 
</P>
<P>
 Sarris, then the critic for the Village Voice, got into hot water with readers 
when he became one of the few reviewers to divulge that particular plot twist. 
But the veteran critic, who was not among that Oscar-winning film's many fans, 
said talking about plot developments is frequently unavoidable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I, for one, think plots are very important," Sarris said. "When a film 
doesn't work, often it is because the plot goes wrong, and you have to describe 
how it goes wrong." But sometimes, he added, it is also necessary to provide 
plot details to show just why a movie succeeds, as he did in his rave review of 
the recent "Flesh and Bone," whose story hinges on several coincidences. 
</P>
<P>
 "To describe what it's about I cannot get around talking about the 
coincidences," Sarris said. Readers were warned not to read further if they had 
not seen the film. Such a warning is a device publications often use when 
giving away endings or surprises is unavoidable. 
</P>
<P>
 Time critic Richard Schickel never thought he was giving anything away when he 
disclosed in his review of "Presumed Innocent" (1990) that the protagonist, 
prosecutor Rusty Sabitch (Harrison Ford), was not the murderer. Like "The 
Pelican Brief," that film was based on a best-selling novel and was directed by 
Alan Pakula. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabitch "is set up from the start as a put-upon hero who we emotionally feel 
is falsely accused," Schickel said. The movie was intended as a dramatic work 
with complex characters, and not just a routine whodunit, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Warner Bros., which had urged critics in a memo to keep the 
film's ending hush-hush, "made a fuss," as Schickel recalls. Unmollified four 
years later, studio spokesman Friedman said recently: "I see no purpose in 
giving away that information." 
</P>
<P>
 That type of information often crops up in reviews for more literary 
publications. Stanley Kauffmann, movie critic for the New Republic, frequently 
describes movie endings and plot points, as he did recently when writing about 
"The Remains of the Day." 
</P>
<P>
 Kauffmann could not be reached. But commenting on the review of "The Remains 
of the Day," Columbia Pictures spokesman Mark Gill said: "The only good thing 
about that is that it came out four weeks after the movie opened. It's still 
bad; it's just not as bad." 
</P>
<P>
 In his review of "Fearless," Terrence Rafferty of the New Yorker recounted the 
final scene of the movie in minute detail. "My general rule is if I think it's 
a really good movie, I don't give it away," Rafferty said. "With a lousy movie, 
I don't feel quite the same level of responsibility."  
</P>
<P>
 Although Rafferty occasionally receives letters from outraged readers, his 
"Fearless" review did not draw a single response, the critic said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps because of their fondness for "The Crying Game," journalists were 
scrupulous about not revealing its gender-bending plot twist. Time's Corliss 
chose to have a little fun with the secret -- but, judging from the absence of 
reader response, apparently did no harm. Strung together, the first letter of 
each paragraph of his review spells out a message that "she is a he." 
</P>
<P>
 The first publication to blow the "Crying Game" secret was Entertainment 
Weekly, which ran a cover story on the movie last spring. By that time, said 
assistant managing editor Richard Sanders, the movie had been playing for 
several months. 
</P>
<P>
 EW has a policy against revealing endings "unless it's really germane to the 
story," Sanders said, as in the article about whether "My Girl" (1991) would 
upset children because the character played by Macaulay Culkin dies from bee 
stings. Even though the piece carried a warning about its content, "We still 
had readers complaining," the editor said. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine was justified in running the "Pelican Brief" story, he said, 
because millions of Grisham fans were familiar with the original ending and "it 
was of interest that the ending had changed and that they had to reshoot it 
real close to the opening date." 
</P>
<P>
 Newsday movie editor Lois Draegin, however, said that writer Jane Galbraith's 
description of the ending just slipped by. "We make a real point and effort not 
to give away endings," she said. "In this case it was an oversight." 
</P>
<P>
 A different version of Galbraith's story -- minus a description of the ending 
-- was subsequently published in the Los Angeles Times, which has a policy 
against revealing endings or plot twists. "Our aim is not to ruin the movie for 
people who are going to go see it," according to Executive Calendar Editor John 
P. Lindsay. 
</P>
<P>
 But last July editors at both The Times and Newsday printed a description of 
the climactic scene from "A Perfect World" in a production story by free-lance 
writer Joe Leydon.  
</P>
<P>
 Lindsay took issue, however, with a reader who complained about an article 
about "Thelma & Louise" that was published after the 1991 movie was released on 
video. By then, Lindsay said, the movie had been so widely seen and discussed 
that it was not necessary to delete references to the ending. 
</P>
<P>
 Studio marketing executives say increasing competition among entertainment 
news outlets has made editors less loath to break their own rules. "Everybody's 
looking for an extra-competitive edge," said Columbia's Gill. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole reason that this 'Pelican Brief' story was written was that 
everybody thought they were doing some discovery piece," Friedman said.  
</P>
<P>
 Schickel, however, believes that it is competition among the studios that has 
caused them to overreact to the EW and Newsday "Pelican Brief" stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "This all has to do with marketing," Schickel said. "I don't think (director) 
Pakula cares a damn about that particular revelation. But in this insanely 
competitive market, the marketing people get upset if they feel they're losing 
even the tiniest edge -- if 300 people say, 'Oh, I know how it turns out, I'm 
not going to see it.' "

KLAX RETAINS TOP SPOT IN QUARTERLY ARBITRON RATINGS; RADIO: SPANISH-LANGUAGE 
STATION'S MORNING SHOW ALSO RANKED NO. 1 FOR THIRD CONSECUTIVE TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Spanish-language KLAX-FM's morning show continued as the most popular radio 
program in the latest Arbitron ratings survey released Wednesday, while the 
English-language competition changed positions in the runner-up categories. 
</P>
<P>
 For the third consecutive quarter, KLAX's team of Juan Carlos Hidalgo and El 
Peladillo (Jesus Garcia) was top-rated in radio's most competitive time slot, 
and the station itself also ranked first overall. It was the fifth quarter in a 
row that the station drew the largest average listenership in the Los Angeles 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the KLAX (97.9) morning duo, who drew 6.6% of the audience, was ribald 
KLSX-FM (97.1) personality Howard Stern, with 6% of the listening audience--up 
from 5.4% and third place in the previous three-month survey.  
</P>
<P>
 In third place was veteran Rick Dees, on KIIS-FM (102.7) and AM (1150), with 
4.7%, up from 4.2%. KLOS-FM (95.5) duo Mark and Brian were in fourth place, 
having dropped from 5.6% to 4.6%.  
</P>
<P>
 Veterans Ken Minyard and Roger Barkley on KABC-AM (790) tied for fifth place 
with Bill Handel on arch-rival talk station KFI-AM (640), each morning show 
drawing 4.4% of the audience. But KFI beat out KABC during the rest of the day, 
ranking fourth overall between the hours of 6 a.m. and midnight, while KABC was 
11th. The KFI ranking is heavily influenced by the huge success of syndicated 
radio personality Rush Limbaugh.  
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's ratings covered the period from Sept. 23 to Dec. 15, 1993. In 
second place overall was rap/urban station KPWR-FM (105.9); easy-listening 
KOST-FM (103.5) was third. Alternative rocker KROQ-FM (106.7) and Top 40 
station KIIS-FM/AM tied for fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most dramatic changes was KCBS-FM (93.1), which in September 
switched from a straight-ahead oldies station to a new, hybrid format of rock 
songs from the '60s and '70s and jumped from 21st to 13th place. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt right from the beginning that we had found a hole in the marketplace, 
and this sort of makes us feel that all that original planning was right," said 
KCBS general manager Dave Van Dyke.

CLUB REVIEW; RIGHT MUSIC, PRICE AT LINGERIE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEIDI SIEGMUND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Club owners caught in the throes of diminishing returns may want to take a tip 
from Club Lingerie, whose busiest night of the week is Monday -- of all nights. 
The veteran Hollywood venue attracts a tres hep crowd by offering a smattering 
of mostly good local bands at the right price -- for free. 
</P>
<P>
 And some of the bands, all of whom have to play without fee for the system to 
work, are actually getting a return on their investment. Such Monday night 
regulars as Weezer, Muzzachunka, Mother Tongue, Rob Rules and Candlebox have 
landed coveted label deals, while simultaneously building local followings.  
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing particularly nice about the cavernous club -- its only attempt 
at art direction consists of two unlit beer signs and a Horace Goldin poster. 
Yet the lack of distractions helps to make the music the club's one and only 
focus. 
</P>
<P>
 The raised stage and the solid sound system, which thankfully isn't engineered 
by someone hellbent on blowing out what's left of the audience's eardrums, 
gives clubgoers the opportunity to scrutinize at least four groups a night -- 
enabling them to decide which bands to spend money on in the future.  
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the band to check out at Lingerie is 1,000 Mona Lisas. Contrary to 
its name, the band consists of three large, bald guys who play a high-test 
blend of punk-rap that lingers long after the trio exits the stage. A Mona 
Lisas' highlight includes a spunky punk cover of "Bennie and the Jets," which 
manages to resuscitate the Elton John tune from the classic rock morgue. 
</P>
<P>
 And hey, even if you don't like them, what's to lose? 
</P>
<P>
 * Club Lingerie, 6507 Sunset Blvd., Hollywood, (213) 466-8557. No cover charge 
on Monday nights. HEIDI SIEGMUND

TV RATINGS; SUNDAY NIGHT LINEUP HELPS CBS WIN THE WEEK 
</P>

 CBS bounced back into the No. 1 spot in the prime-time ratings last week, the 
A.C. Nielsen Co. reported Wednesday, thanks to the network's usual strong 
Sunday night lineup. "60 Minutes" was the second highest-rated show of the 
week, "Murder, She Wrote" was fourth and sandwiched between them was CBS' 
Sunday movie, "Jane's House," starring Anne Archer and James Woods. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC finished second for the week, fueled by the Orange Bowl on Saturday and 
the debut of its action series "Viper" on Sunday.The Orange Bowl, featuring the 
nail-biting showdown between Florida State and Nebraska, was seen in about 16.8 
million households, while ABC's simultaneous coverage of the Sugar Bowl--in 
which Florida rolled over West Virginia--drew only about 4.9 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite finishing third for the week, ABC had five of the Top 10 programs, 
including No. 1 "Home Improvement," and it remains a close second behind CBS in 
the season-to-date standings. Southland Ratings

MCGAW OF IRVINE AGREES TO $440-MILLION TAKEOVER; MERGER: CONSOLIDATION WITH A 
FLORIDA DRUG FIRM REFLECTS ANTICIPATION OF REFORMS IN THE HEALTH-CARE INDUSTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES M. GOMEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Continuing a trend of rapid consolidation in the health-care industry, McGaw 
Inc. said Wednesday it has agreed to be taken over by a Florida maker of 
generic drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The tentative acquisition by IVAX Corp. of Miami is valued at $440 million and 
would involve a stock swap in which original McGaw shareholders would double 
their investment. 
</P>
<P>
 McGaw officials said the majority of stock in each company is owned by 
insiders, including board members who approved the deal. "We don't see any 
problem with this going through," said James M. Sweeney, chairman and chief 
executive officer of McGaw. 
</P>
<P>
 IVAX officials were not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 McGaw began searching for a merger partner last spring after it became 
apparent that pending changes under national health-care reform would make 
specialty firms like McGaw less competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 The company makes intravenous solutions that are mixed with drugs and sent to 
hospitals, clinics and home health-care companies. McGaw also developed and 
makes a non-polluting, plastic IV bag that was lauded by Vice President Al Gore 
and on which it holds a patent; and it has an exclusive contract with the U.S. 
Department of Veterans Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials said some customers are concerned that they cannot buy both 
intravenous solutions and drugs from a single supplier. "Basically, we need to 
have a complete line of products to offer if we are going to prosper in the 
future," said McGaw spokesman Lawrence A. Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 After discussing a possible takeover with several drug manufacturers, McGaw 
settled on IVAX as best suited to become its parent company. IVAX, which had 
1992 revenue of $451 million and is expected to show 1993 revenue of $600 
million, is one of the nation's leading manufacturers of generic drugs, Sweeney 
said, and is poised to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good match," said Sweeney, who bought the company in 1990. "We think 
the generic side of the drug business is where the action is." 
</P>
<P>
 McGaw had 1992 revenue of $309 million and sales of $84 million for its latest 
quarter. The company has an estimated $150 million in debt, which IVAX would 
assume, putting the acquisition's actual value close to $600 million. The deal, 
expected to be finalized by March, requires approval of the U.S. Securities and 
Exchange Commission and shareholders from both companies. 
</P>
<P>
 McGaw shareholders will profit handsomely. McGaw began selling stock publicly 
in February, offering shares at $8 apiece. Under the proposed takeover, McGaw 
shareholders would receive $16 worth of IVAX stock for each of their McGaw 
shares, Sweeney said. 
</P>
<P>
 McGaw's stock, traded on the Nasdaq market, closed Wednesday at $10.75 a 
share, down 12.5 cents. IVAX, traded on the American Stock Exchange, closed at 
$28.125 a share, up 50 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be no layoffs at McGaw's Irvine headquarters after the merger, 
Sweeney said, though the board of directors and the chief executive job will be 
dissolved. The operation will continue to use the McGaw name, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeney said he will stay on as an executive strategy adviser for both the 
parent company and the new subsidiary.

TRUMP NEARING DEAL TO ACQUIRE ALADDIN HOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After several years of trying to enter the Las Vegas gambling business, 
developer Donald Trump is on the verge of buying the troubled Aladdin Hotel, a 
top Trump executive said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But industry analysts and officials said that making such a move successfully 
would require a major investment and would be a gamble for the New York 
developer. 
</P>
<P>
 Trump's purchase of the 1,000-room resort on the Las Vegas Strip is imminent, 
said Dennis Gomes, a veteran casino executive who currently heads Trump's Taj 
Mahal casino-hotel in Atlantic City. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can expect some type of announcement next week relative to this," Gomes 
said. "That's how close we are to something." 
</P>
<P>
 Gomes declined to comment on the specifics of Trump's plans, but a source told 
Associated Press that the developer has a verbal agreement with the hotel's 
mortgage holder to buy it for $65 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Trump plans to demolish the resort in phases and use a new, separate public 
offering to raise enough money to finance a new resort aimed at high-rolling 
gamblers, according to a source who asked to remain anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaming industry observers say Trump would have little choice but to rebuild 
the Aladdin to remain competitive with the neighboring themed resorts -- such 
as MGM Grand, Luxor and Treasure Island -- that have opened in recent months. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are going to put your shingle out there, I imagine you'd want to put 
your best foot forward and not have people think it's a rehabilitation of an 
old property," said Henry Gluck, chairman of Los Angeles-based Caesars World, 
which operates Caesars Palace. 
</P>
<P>
 Trump would reportedly finance the purchase from money obtained in a planned 
public offering of investments in his Atlantic City casino properties. Trump's 
New Jersey casinos emerged from bankruptcy proceedings in late 1992, and he 
recently reached agreement to regain 50% of the Taj Mahal casino, surrendered 
in a 1991 bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Aladdin has been operated by a management company for Bell Atlantic-Tricon 
Leasing Corp. of Paramus, N.J., which owns the mortgage on the resort and has 
been trying to sell it for more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1991 attempt to auction the bankrupt resort failed when no bidders emerged 
with the minimum $53.5-million price. However, negotiations with several groups 
have been heating up in recent months as potential bidders were drawn by the 
Aladdin's prime location on the Strip. It sits between resorts such as The 
Mirage, Caesars Palace, MGM Grand and Luxor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a way he could capitalize on the attention Las Vegas is getting," said 
William N. Thompson, a gaming industry expert and professor at the University 
of Nevada, Las Vegas. "But the idea of another half-billion-dollar resort is a 
little far-fetched right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the prospect of another major gambling resort, current casino 
operators said a major Trump property would only serve to attract more people 
to Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 It would also be several years before Trump could finish building a major 
casino resort and compete head-on with well-established properties, said Tom 
Hantges, a gaming industry analyst at USA Capital Management Group. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the question becomes whether Trump can do it and be successful," 
Hantges said. "It's more of a risk for Trump than for the people around him." 
</P>
<P>
 Trump also needs to obtain a license from Nevada gaming regulators to operate 
or receive revenues from a casino in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Trump launched an exploratory company in 1989 to try to find a Nevada 
property, but he abandoned the move when his financial empire ran into trouble. 
Trump was believed to be interested in buying the luxurious Mirage.

WARNS AGENCY TO ACT QUICKLY TO INCLUDE MINORITIES, URGES EASING OF MORTGAGE 
TERMS.

 Rep. Maxine Waters, inundated with complaints about the Resolution Trust 
Corp.'s West Coast office, told officials of the federal agency Wednesday that 
they had better act quickly to include African Americans in the thrift cleanup 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Democrat also urged the RTC's West Coast managers to broaden 
their efforts at modifying burdensome mortgage terms so that homeowners facing 
foreclosure can save their houses and resume paying off loans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to remove the obstacles between the RTC and the outside world," Waters 
said in an interview during a daylong session at the agency's Newport Beach 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 As a member of the House Banking Committee, she plans to take what she learned 
Wednesday to Washington to monitor the RTC's efforts and recommend changes, 
especially ones to help homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 business people from the congresswoman's district, which encompasses 
most of South-Central Los Angeles, joined her in questioning RTC managers about 
how they go about their job of managing and selling properties from failed 
savings and loans. 
</P>
<P>
 RTC officials said they have been seeking out minority-owned companies in 
South-Central Los Angeles, but commercial real estate broker Will Hardy of Los 
Angeles said, "We just haven't seen much of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy, who has been in the business for 23 years, said in an interview that he 
got the run-around when he tried to help a client who was late on mortgage 
payments to an S&L that had failed. The RTC was operating the thrift, Hardy 
said, so he went to officials there. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said they didn't have the power to restructure the loan, and they told 
me to go to the RTC office in Newport Beach," he said. "The RTC there said they 
fired everybody at that thrift and put new people in, so I should go back there 
to straighten it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy said he was unable to get the RTC to respond, something he said has 
occurred frequently in the nearly four years the West Coast office has been 
open. 
</P>
<P>
 Others expressed similar frustrations about their efforts to acquire RTC 
properties, obtain work from the agency or help clients with problem loans 
under the agency's control. 
</P>
<P>
 Under federal law, the RTC is supposed to use the private sector for most of 
its work, and woman- and minority-owned businesses are supposed to receive 
special consideration for handling the agency's work. 
</P>
<P>
 But African Americans at the meeting say they have largely been shut out from 
obtaining RTC work. And they worry that little will come their way before the 
agency itself is scheduled to go out of business at the end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the last go-round," Waters said. "If we don't get in in a substantial 
way, then a significant portion of the business community will have lost out." 
</P>
<P>
 Waters described her "biggest pet peeve" as the reluctance of lenders and the 
RTC to alter loan terms for borrowers who can't make payments because of lost 
jobs, medical expenses or other temporary cash constraints. 
</P>
<P>
 Other business people at the meeting complained that the RTC, which began 
talking to black community leaders only in the past six months or so, hasn't 
explained well enough how privately owned businesses can buy properties or 
obtain work from the agency. 
</P>
<P>
 They also questioned the Newport Beach office's effort to reach into the black 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only last year that the agency started advertising occasionally in the 
Los Angeles Sentinel, one of the nation's largest black-owned newspapers. And 
it was only last fall when the RTC first met with the two major African 
American realtor groups in Los Angeles: the Southwest Board of Realtors and the 
Consolidated Realty Board of Southern California.

POOR RESULTS SPUR KMART TO STEP UP OVERHAUL; RETAIL: THE GIANT DISCOUNTER WILL 
FINANCE THE PLAN BY SELLING STAKES IN FOUR SPECIALTY CHAINS. IT HOPES TO REGAIN 
GROUND LOST TO WAL-MART.

<P>
 Embarking on a New Year's self-improvement program of grand proportions, Kmart 
Corp., the nation's second-largest retailer, said Wednesday that it will 
accelerate its chain-wide overhaul by relocating and refurbishing hundreds of 
stores, closing dozens of others and selling pieces of its book, home 
improvement, sports and office supply retail chains. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the moves -- particularly the focus on sprucing up the Kmart discount 
store made famous by the "blue-light special" -- is more than a quest to 
improve sagging profits, which Kmart said Wednesday will be lower than 
expected. Kmart's announcements also reflect the cutthroat retail environment 
that has forced retailers to rethink not just prices, but the nuts and bolts of 
presenting merchandise to value-conscious consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kmart has in recent years found itself squeezed between Wal-Mart, which has 
lower prices, and the likes of Sears and J.C. Penney, which have aggressively 
and successfully remodeled stores and improved their merchandise mix. Kmart's 
new store "modernization" plan comes three years after the company announced an 
initial refurbishing program that has resulted in improved apparel sales at 
remodeled stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same reason that people like to get rid of old shoes, old cars, old 
clothes and old houses," said Doug Hope, publisher of Display & Design Ideas, 
an Atlanta-based monthly design publication for retailers. "An old, 
tired-looking store doesn't do as well as a new or remodeled store. . . . 
Kmart's stores look bad and aren't performing well." 
</P>
<P>
 Remodeling a store generally yields a 30% increase in sales, Hope said. Kmart 
said its "new look" stores have outperformed its older stores, with 17% higher 
sales and 12% higher customer counts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kmart is obviously admitting they had a terrible year," said Alan Millstein, 
editor of Fashion Network Report, a monthly newsletter for retailers. "They're 
taking aggressive steps. Whether the consumer responds remains to be seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Kmart said it will concentrate on its central business of discount retailing 
and raise cash for its expanded $3.2-billion remodeling program by selling 
stock, ranging between 20% and 30%, in four of its specialty retail units: the 
Builders Square home improvement chain, the Officemax office supply chain, the 
Sports Authority sporting goods chain and a new combined book business composed 
of Kmart's separate Waldenbooks and Borders chains. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it will have relocated 800 stores by the end of 1996 -- 500 
more than originally planned in 1990 -- because many stores are too old or too 
small to remodel. Altogether, the company said, it will have remodeled 670 
stores and expanded 700 outlets by 1996, totaling more than half its nearly 
2,500 locations in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Kmart said it will open 177 stores in new markets and will close 
75 other stores by 1996, on top of about 75 closed since 1990. It said it does 
not anticipate laying off workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has not yet determined which stores will be moved. But during a 
news conference at Kmart headquarters in Troy, Mich., Chairman and Chief 
Executive Joseph Antonini said the company plans to look for new store sites in 
the same vicinity as the affected stores. 
</P>
<P>
 To cover costs of the modernization program and other non-recurring charges, 
Kmart will take a pretax charge of $1.3 billion, or $850 million after taxes, 
against 1993 earnings. That does not include $450 million in after-tax charges 
that Kmart already planned to take. They are related to the 1993 sales of its 
PACE Membership Warehouse and Payless Drug Stores Northwest subsidiaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "By focusing on five strong businesses and enhancing our financial 
flexibility, Kmart Corp. will be positioned for improved strategic and 
financial performance in the highly competitive retail markets of the 1990s," 
Antonini said. 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes are high, and Kmart's hand, based on the all-important Christmas 
selling season, apparently is weak. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonini said same-store sales -- revenue at stores open at least 12 months -- 
rose 3% in December but that earnings for the month declined by an unspecified 
amount because of price cutting. What's more, he said, Kmart expects earnings 
for the fourth quarter and full year ending Jan. 26 to be well below last 
year's levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street analysts had expected Kmart to earn about $1.80 a share this 
fiscal year, according to estimates compiled by Zacks Investment Research. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street was unimpressed by the announcements. Kmart's stock fell 50 cents 
to $21 on the New York Stock Exchange. In addition, the Standard & Poor's Corp. 
and Moody's Investors Service rating agencies said they may downgrade Kmart's 
debt ratings.

BENTSEN PREDICTS INTEREST RATES WILL RISE IN '94; ECONOMY: THE TREASURY 
SECRETARY'S COMMENTS SUGGEST THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WOULDN'T FIGHT A FED MOVE 
TO TIGHTEN MONEY SUPPLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a signal that the Clinton Administration is prepared to accept at least 
some brakes on the nation's economic recovery, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen 
predicted Wednesday that the economy will have to weather a period of higher 
interest rates and declining stock prices in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 His remarks suggest that the Administration, which had hoped that low interest 
rates would continue to feed the recovery through 1994, now believes there will 
be some economic speed bumps along the way. Even so, Bentsen said the 
Administration expects the recovery to remain on track and unemployment to 
subside this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Discussing the economic outlook with a small group of reporters, Bentsen said 
it appears likely that there will be a modest increase in short-term interest 
rates and that stock markets will experience a downward correction. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not predict that the Federal Reserve Board will orchestrate the 
interest rate increase as part of its mission to keep inflation in check, but 
the Fed has broad power to influence short-term rates. 
</P>
<P>
 While Bentsen's comments echoed the forecasts of many private analysts, it is 
unusual for a Treasury secretary to predict such developments. Among other 
things, his comments served as a signal that the Administration would not argue 
against a Fed decision to push interest rates higher. 
</P>
<P>
 He did not take credit on behalf of the Administration for the decline in 
interest rates that has sent them to their lowest levels since Lyndon B. 
Johnson was President, or for a drop in inflation, which he said is now at an 
"acceptable" level. At a rate of 2.8%, he said, inflation is at its lowest 
level in 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But he did say these developments are attributable, at least to some degree, 
to the Administration's efforts to tackle the budget deficit. The 
Administration has put forward a plan intended to trim $500 billion from the 
deficit over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen also chided Japan for not doing more to stimulate its ailing economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japan, with its huge trade surplus, cannot look to the United States and 
other countries to make up for slack demand at home," he said in a speech 
intended to give the Administration a pat on the back for its first-year 
economic performance and to send a signal of confidence in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged that the U.S. interest in a growing domestic market in Japan 
is based on the need to build overseas consumption of U.S. products. 
</P>
<P>
 And, in a comment that set off a small flurry in currency markets, Bentsen 
said that meddling with the exchange rate of the yen -- allowing it to fall in 
value in relation to the dollar to make Japanese products more competitive in 
the United States, for example -- is not a course favored in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "Allowing the yen to slide is not an acceptable way out of recession for 
Japan," he said. The dollar rose to 112.90 yen, up from 112.60 on Tuesday, 
after falling earlier in trading in Tokyo. The dollar was mixed against other 
currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts attributed a rise in interest rates Wednesday to apprehension in 
the market over Bentsen's comments. The Treasury's key 30-year bond yield rose 
to 6.40% from Tuesday's 6.34%. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen addressed the Administration's 1993 economic efforts in two separate 
forums, first with reporters invited to his conference room and then in a 
speech at the Brookings Institution, a public policy research organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to see that the Administration gets some credit for it," Bentsen told 
reporters, reflecting the political sensitivity attached to the role that a 
successful economic recovery is likely to play in President Clinton's political 
fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to low interest and inflation rates, he cited positive signs that 
include a "booming" stock market, falling unemployment, increases in 
productivity, lowered business debt and greater business equity. 
</P>
<P>
 Predicting more of the same for 1994, he said: "I'd like to see us achieve a 
solid 3% real growth and hold inflation to approximately 3%. This should allow 
interest rates to remain relatively low and reduce further the unemployment 
rate. . . . It's been a good first year -- solid, steady, non-inflationary 
growth -- and we're planning to sustain this one." 
</P>
<P>
 But asked whether he agrees with the assessment of private analysts that 1994 
would see a correction in the stock market, he said, "That would not surprise 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he added that he did not expect any such drop to become "so major as to 
slow down the growth of business." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether he anticipates any move to boost interest rates in the first 
quarter of the year, he said the Administration assumes "there will be a modest 
increase in short-term rates." But he took care not to say when it would occur 
or how long it would last.

THE SPIN DOCTORS; FLYWHEELS SEEN AS KEY TO A PRACTICAL ELECTRIC VEHICLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 In the basin where the word smog was invented, alternative-fuel vehicles -- 
particularly cars that store energy in flywheels -- will be a center of 
attention at this year's Los Angeles Auto Show, which opens Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler Corp. will show off its concept of a flywheel-assisted race car, 
which the company unveiled Wednesday in Detroit. And American Flywheel System, 
a small company based in Bellevue, Wash., will display a sedan that would run 
entirely on the energy-storage devices, called flywheel batteries. 
</P>
<P>
 The international push by auto makers to develop a practical electric car has 
been slowed by researchers' difficulties in coming up with batteries able to 
replicate the driving features of gasoline-powered autos. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents say high-tech flywheels, which store energy through the same 
ancient principle used in a potter's wheel, could be used as a new battery to 
make electric cars a reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot going on lately in flywheels," said Jim Birk, director of 
storage and renewables at the Electric Power Research Institute, which conducts 
research and development work for the major U.S. electric utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 One plus for flywheels in transportation uses: fast acceleration. "Flywheels 
have the characteristic of very fast response time," Birk said. Another, 
according to Edward W. Furia, American Flywheel Systems chairman and chief 
executive, is their potential to greatly increase driving range.  
</P>
<P>
 Furia estimates that between charges, his flywheel car will be able to go more 
than three times the current 100-mile range of many of the best existing 
electric cars. 
</P>
<P>
 American Flywheel Systems "has some very interesting concepts," said Philip C. 
Symons, manager of public transportation projects at EPRI, "but it remains to 
be proved that the performance required for electric vehicles can be achieved." 
</P>
<P>
 American Flywheel developed its storage device with the manufacturer, 
Minneapolis-based Honeywell, which for three decades has built flywheels for 
the aerospace and defense industries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chrysler car, called the Patriot, has a 500-horsepower 
liquid-natural-gas-burning turbine, but it uses the flywheel to store excess 
energy. Both the turbine and flywheel feed an electric motor that runs the race 
car at speeds of up to 200 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chrysler carbon-fiber flywheel is similar to that used in satellites. In 
the race car, it stores excess energy produced by the turbine and captures 
kinetic energy produced when the brakes are applied. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where is it written that a car that is 'green' cannot be red-hot with 
excitement," Francois Castaing, Chrysler's vice president of vehicle 
engineering, said in unveiling the car at the North American International Auto 
Show in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Flywheel car and other attempts to harness flywheels as the main 
energy-storage device for a vehicle are aimed at meeting California's 
zero-emission vehicle rules, which essentially require major auto makers to 
offer electric cars for sale in California showrooms beginning in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 The race car project serves a dual purpose for Chrysler. It allows the company 
to re-enter big-time racing while placing a priority on research and 
development for the clean car of the future -- including cars known as hybrids, 
which run on two fuels. 
</P>
<P>
 Hybrid vehicles are seen as promising, particularly by auto makers faced with 
the 1998 deadline, because the two sources of propulsion help extend vehicle 
range and performance. Auto makers have called for amending the California 
rules to achieve air pollution reductions without requiring electric cars. 
Though hybrids have low emissions, they would not meet California's looming 
zero-emission standard.  
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler hopes to have a working model of its race car within several months 
and to decide within the year whether to proceed further. It hopes to be 
sanctioned by international and U.S. motor sports groups to compete in 
endurance races in a special class for cutting-edge vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Castaing said cars using such technology would probably not be ready for the 
market until well into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 Other alternative-fuel vehicles at the Los Angeles show will include a 
Mitsubishi electric hybrid that claims a range of 310 miles in its battery-only 
mode, a Ford natural-gas version of its big Crown Victoria, and a Chrysler 
natural gas minivan that will be the first vehicle to be certified by the state 
Air Resources Board as an ultra-low-emissions vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 There will also be a stubby, high-efficiency Mercedes-Benz "city car," the 
first of a new class of Mercedes designed for extremely high efficiency in 
versions that use gasoline, diesel or electric batteries. How Flywheel 
Batteries Work 
</P>
<P>
 Using the same ancient energy-storage principle that keeps a potter's wheel or 
yo-yo turning, high-tech flywheels can be used to store electricity, much like 
a standard battery. Charging the battery with electricity increases the speed 
of the flywheel, up to 200,000 revolutions per minute. As electricity is 
drained from the battery to run an engine, the flywheel gradually slows down. 
Proponents say that modern, highly efficient flywheels -- which spin in a 
vacuum on non-touching magnetic bearings -- could power electric cars better 
than more traditional chemical batteries, giving up to three times the driving 
range. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wheel: 
</P>
<P>
 Small, speedy wheels made of tough composite materials store the energy. 
</P>
<P>
 Vacuum casing: 
</P>
<P>
 The wheel spins in a vacuum, to greatly lower resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnetic bearings: 
</P>
<P>
 Because the same magnetic poles repel each other, magnets are used to suspend 
the wheel as it spins, without the friction of traditional bearings which 
physically touch.

INNOVATION: INFORMATION AGE HAVE-NOTS? LET THEM READ BOOKS; MICHAEL SCHRAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To hear the technocrats talk, America is busy creating the underclass of the 
future. The rise of the "information superhighway" means a new kind of poverty. 
The modem-less masses and the data-deprived will huddle beneath the highway's 
overpasses, shut off from the multimedia mainstream. Without government 
intervention, they say, the information-rich will get richer and the 
information-poor will get poorer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to figure out a way to maintain service to everyone," one 
senior White House official recently told Business Week magazine. "The danger 
you run is creating a society of information haves and have-nots." 
</P>
<P>
 No. The real risk we run is re-creating a welfare state ethic in cyberspace. 
Of all the misconceptions surrounding multimedia innovation and digital 
superhighway metaphors, none is more misguided or misleading than the belief 
that access to new telecommunications technologies is somehow central to 
determining wealth and poverty in the Information Age. This is a pseudo issue 
that better reflects the paternalistic pretensions of a public policy elite 
than compassion for the less fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
 It's bizarre that certain pundits and prognosticators want to focus on 
high-tech network access subsidies for the masses barely three months after the 
Department of Education published a survey claiming to show that fully half of 
American adults are close to functionally illiterate. What does network access 
mean to them? Or is network access really a condescending euphemism for "Gee, 
poor people have a lot of time on their hands. Let's let 'em watch ESPN, MTV 
and CNN for free"? 
</P>
<P>
 Telecommunication does have a populist role to play. No one argues, for 
instance, that telephone "lifeline" services are not essential to guarantee 
everyone -- no matter how poor -- immediate access to police, fire and other 
local calls. Lifeline subsidies are as essential as the services they provide. 
Indeed, there's no denying that America's success providing universal telephone 
service throughout the country was a direct result of policies and regulations 
that promoted cross-subsidies.  
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, expanding this system of telecommunications subsidies to 
include new telecommunications services seems a noble goal. In practice, 
however, the more you examine the idea, the sillier and more convoluted it 
becomes. 
</P>
<P>
 Just what do we want to subsidize here, and why? Is it really, as the White 
House official said, information access? If that were true, it would be far 
more logical and cost-effective to give people subsidies for newspaper and 
magazine purchases and keep the public libraries open longer. We would also run 
our society as if we cared about literacy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What fundamental changes are occurring that, all of a sudden, make multimedia 
technology subsidies such good public policy? The coming convergence of cable 
TV and local phone companies? That's simply ridiculous: Is access to CNN or 
C-SPAN an essential public service, like dialing 911? 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Turner may disagree, but it's not. We may decide, in the interests of 
fairness and equity, that we want to subsidize the cable television viewing of 
our compatriots. But let's not try to justify that subsidy on the grounds of 
creating economic opportunity for the information have-nots. 
</P>
<P>
 So maybe the real policy concern here isn't mere information access, but 
technology access. Well, while we certainly subsidized the growth of telephone 
systems, we chose not to subsidize sales of radios and television sets or VCRs 
or telephone answering machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Has that promoted a two-tiered society of communications rich and poor? Should 
we now subsidize purchases of personal computers and modems to ensure access to 
interactive media on the networks? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this is a fully competitive marketplace where prices have been 
plummeting for years. You can go out today and buy for less than $200 a 14.4 
high-speed modem -- a technology that cost more than $1,000 barely three years 
ago. You can get a slower, 2,400-band modem for under $80. And they will get 
cheaper yet. 
</P>
<P>
 So do we buy the high-performance Porsches for driving on the information 
highway, or do we buy the clunky jalopies? Where do you draw the line? In an 
environment of constantly declining prices, what subsidies make sense? Or 
should we expect people to buy $500 computer-TV sets out of their own pockets? 
</P>
<P>
 It is completely understandable that digital do-gooders and the 
computationally compassionate care about the segments of society that literally 
cannot afford to be early adopters of new technologies. Then again, look at the 
tremendous penetration rates of discretionary, unsubsidized media technologies 
such as radio, television, Walkmen, video games and VCRs. 
</P>
<P>
 If we're honest, we'll acknowledge that access to the latest media technology 
isn't nearly as important as access to the latest health care technology. The 
real problem isn't access; it's some pundits' insistence that issues of social 
equity and economic opportunity are better shaped by investing in technology 
than in people. That's a bad idea, and it leads to bad policy.

VENDORS REIN IN ELECTRONICS SHOW HYPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY HARMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Consumer Electronics Show has long been the place to offer futuristic 
demonstrations, portend gadget-inspired revolutions and peddle what is not so 
affectionately known as "vaporware." 
</P>
<P>
 But the high-tech buzz at the winter show, which opens here today, is 
conspicuously lower -- the result, some analysts say, of the nascent multimedia 
industry's realization that too much hype can make reality pale by comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the show's brightest offerings materialized in the marketplace over 
the last six months with less than spectacular results. 3DO's multi-player, the 
sophisticated video game machine first announced at last year's CES and shown 
off in prototype form at the June show, has sold fewer than 40,000 units since 
it reached stores in October, according to analysts' estimates. Company goals 
had been as high as 100,000 for 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Apple Computer's hand-held Newton, which former Chairman John Sculley 
prophesied at a previous CES would "help solve world problems" was also poorly 
received when it was introduced this fall, as consumers discovered its most 
innovative features -- handwriting recognition and portable telecommunications 
capabilities -- were not in working order.  
</P>
<P>
 The planned launch of the Sega Channel, much whispered about at last summer's 
CES and formally announced the following week, has been put off until summer. 
The channel will allow subscribers to download and play video games on their 
televisions without buying the cartridges. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we could (launch) it by the first quarter of this year," said Doug 
Glen, Sega's group vice president of business de velopment, as he wandered 
around the half-erected convention booths Wednesday. "But this is hard work."  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, even as sales of multimedia CD-ROM software boomed over the Christmas 
retail season and strategic alliances for an interactive age continue to be 
pounded out, analysts say the last few months have sobered an industry that, by 
most accounts, has coasted on hype. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a lot of this stuff, the expectation outstripped the reality," said Bruce 
Ryon, analyst for research firm Dataquest Inc. "I think there was an assumption 
that the technology could do what they wanted it to -- and the fact is, it's 
really very complicated." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, this year's show is likely to focus more on refining existing 
technology than on introducing new product lines. 3DO is expected to 
demonstrate higher-quality full-motion video for its multiplayer and to preview 
the version of the machine that will serve as a set-top cable decoder box in 
U.S. West's interactive television trial this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Apple will show off new software for the Newton. Sega, Nintendo and Sony will 
give glimpses of their respective next-generation video game machines. And 
dozens of new multimedia titles, for the personal computer and for TV-based 
game systems, will be unveiled. 
</P>
<P>
 Emiel Petrone, marketing vice president for Philips Consumer Electronics, 
views the change in tone as the beginnings of maturation for an industry still 
very much in its infancy. Petrone has had an uphill battle marketing CD-I, 
which plays movies, audio CDs and interactive software. Its premiere in 1991 
may have been ahead of its time. 
</P>
<P>
 "To convey to people what the notion of interactivity is is very difficult," 
Petrone said. "It's not the kind of product category where you wake up and say, 
'Hey, it's 9 o'clock and I haven't interacted yet.' To establish a new product 
category in consumer electronics is more than one or two shows -- we haven't 
even scratched the surface."

BORDEN TO SELL OFF UNITS IN BID TO REVITALIZE; RESTRUCTURING: DIVISIONS BEING 
SHED PROVIDED COMPANY WITH 20% OF ITS PROJECTED SALES, OR $1.25 BILLION, LAST 
YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Borden Inc. said Wednesday that it is getting out of snack foods, jams and 
seafood in a much-anticipated restructuring that will lead to a dividend cut 
and $650 million in charges for the diversified foods giant. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street analysts generally praised the moves but also expressed 
disappointment, saying the company did not go far enough to turn itself around. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors evidently were even less impressed. Borden's stock lost $2.375 to 
end at $15.875 on the New York Stock Exchange, as investors focused on the 
halved dividend and prospects for more losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal of this program is to build shareholder value by focusing on and 
revitalizing our best businesses," Borden Chairman Frank Tasco said in 
announcing the board's approval of the restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
 Borden said it expects to report a 1993 loss of up to $600 million, which 
would be equal to $4.26 a share, including the $650 million in charges. Its 
annual dividend will be cut in half to 30 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also said it expects 1994 earnings to be at the upper end of the 
range of the 75 cents to $1 a share estimated by analysts, and it forecast a 
marginally profitable first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Divisions being put up for sale include Wise potato chips, Jays, Seyferts', 
Guy's, Clover Club and, in Canada, Humpty Dumpty. It is also selling its 
seafood unit, which makes Snow's and Doxsee clam products and Bama jams and 
jellies. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said the divisions being sold provided total revenue of $1.25 
billion, or 20% of last year's projected sales of $6.75 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to restructure the food and specialty chemical maker comes on the 
heels of the forced resignation in December of Chief Executive Anthony D'Amato. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, Borden's directors were also considering the sale of the entire 
company following a series of disappointing earnings. Borden's stock climbed 
sharply in anticipation of a takeover, with Hanson speculated to be the likely 
buyer. 
</P>
<P>
 But the stock drifted lower as the company said it would not attempt a merger 
and instead would undergo its third restructuring since 1989 in another attempt 
to forge a more cohesive unit from its array of consumer and chemical products. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing that was more dramatic or creative than had been 
anticipated by the market," said Joanna Scharf at S.G. Warburg. "They're doing 
the right things, but slowly." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a big disappointment for people who were buying the stock even 
yesterday for a takeover," said Nomi Ghez, an analyst with Goldman Sachs. 
"Clearly, there is no takeover." 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, the company said the latest cost reductions, which will be 
phased in over two years, will produce savings of $100 million to $125 million 
by 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Borden said the restructuring plan will be carried out by Ervin Shames, who 
was named president and chief executive in December. He was formerly on the 
marketing and corporate planning team of Kraft General Foods. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it will focus on developing its pasta and sauce units, niche 
grocery and international foods. 
</P>
<P>
 "Borden historically has not put sufficient investment behind the many good 
brands we do have," Shames told analysts in a conference call.  
</P>
<P>
 "Borden's key niche brands, such as Cracker Jack candied popcorn and peanuts, 
ReaLemon lemon juice, Wyler's bouillon and Eagle Brand sweetened condensed 
milk, have strong shares but historically have been under-marketed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's other products include Elmer's and Krazy Glue adhesives.

ECONOMIC GAINS LIFT DOW BY 15 TO RECORD CLOSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Blue-chip stocks jumped to a record close in a late rally, leading the broad 
market higher. Industrial issues were in demand as investors bet on a strong 
economy, and oil stocks surged as oil's price leaped. 
</P>
<P>
 * The seesaw in interest rates continued as Treasury bond yields moved up. 
Meanwhile, the dollar rallied against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrials powered higher in the final minutes to close up 14.92 
points at 3,798.82, a new high that topped the old peak of 3,794.33 set Dec. 
29. 
</P>
<P>
 The broad market followed the Dow, but most other stock indexes failed to set 
new highs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sign of the heavy institutional interest in stocks, trading volume on the 
New York Stock Exchange rocketed to 400 million shares. Winning stocks topped 
losers by 12 to 10 on the NYSE and by 14 to 11 on Nasdaq. 
</P>
<P>
 Early January is typically the strongest period of the year for inflows of new 
cash to money managers, who then must turn around and invest, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 And with economic reports increasingly pointing to robust growth, many 
institutional investors now appear hungry for stocks of companies whose profits 
should rise with the economy's fortunes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department on Wednesday bolstered sentiment with news that 
factory orders in November rose 1.4%, a stronger than expected showing. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Industrial issues leading the market up included Alcoa, up 1 3/4 to 72 1/4; 
International Paper, up 2 3/4 to 72 3/8; Phelps Dodge, up 1 7/8 to 50 3/4; 
Monsanto, up 1 3/8 to 75 1/4; Georgia-Pacific, up 2 1/8 to 72 1/4, and Briggs & 
Stratton, up 1 1/4 to 83 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Transportation issues, also sensitive to the economy, were strong. Railroad 
CSX surged 3 1/8 to 84, Conrail gained 1 1/8 to 66 3/8, Roadway added 1 1/2 to 
62 1/4 and American Airlines parent AMR rose 1 3/8 to 68 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Energy stocks moving up with oil's rebound included Chevron, up 1 1/4 to 90 
3/4; Arco, up 1 7/8 to 108 3/8; Phillips, up 1 to 30 3/4, and Enron Oil & Gas, 
up 2 1/2 to 41 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many technology issues rebounded sharply. Apple leaped 2 1/4 to 33 3/4, 
Digital Equipment gained 2 1/4 to 37, 3DO jumped 3 to 23 1/4, Texas Instruments 
rocketed 4 to 66, Lotus Development was up 3 to 57 and Newbridge Networks 
surged 3 1/4 to 60 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Beaten-down gaming stocks were also hot. MGM Grand soared 2 3/8 to 37 1/8, 
Mirage added 1 1/4 to 24, International Game Technology jumped 2 7/8 to 31 3/4 
and President Riverboat was up 2 to 24. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the downside, utilities weakened as interest rates moved up. American 
Electric Power lost 1/2 to 36 1/2, Con Ed fell 5/8 to 31 3/8, Houston 
Industries dropped 5/8 to 46 1/4 and SCEcorp eased 1/4 to 20 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign markets, Mexico City's Bolsa index skyrocketed 98.42 points, or 
3.9%, to a record 2,657.31 as investors shook off worries about the peasant 
uprising near the country's southern border. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks also hit a record in Toronto, where the TSE-300 index shot up 32.54 
points to 4,401.08. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo stocks also rallied strongly, with the Nikkei-225 index rising 413.74 
points to 17,783.48. 
</P>
<P>
 But profit takers took markets lower in London, Frankfurt, Paris and Hong 
Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 Optimism about the economy and a surge in oil prices knocked the bond market 
for a loss -- the sixth in eight sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond jumped to 6.40% from Tuesday's 6.34%. 
But shorter-term yields were up much less. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say many bond investors are nervous ahead of Friday's scheduled 
government report on December employment -- the first major statistic on the 
economy's health last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Some bond investors are concerned that December job growth will come in above 
expectations, which could fan fears of brisker economic growth and thus hasten 
the day the Federal Reserve Board tightens credit. 
</P>
<P>
 In oil markets, light, sweet crude futures soared 67 cents to $15.34 a barrel 
on the New York Merc on speculation that OPEC will move up its planned March 25 
meeting to deal with the world oil glut. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere: 
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar finished at 112.90 Japanese yen in New York, up from 112.60 on 
Tuesday, as traders shrugged off comments by Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen 
that appeared aimed at restraining the dollar's recent rise against the yen. A 
weaker yen would help Japanese export growth. 
</P>
<P>
 * Profit takers dominated metals markets. Gold futures slumped $3 to $391.10 
an ounce on the New York Comex, and silver futures slid 14.5 cents to $5.06 an 
ounce.

 Cars, Aircraft Boost November Factory Orders 1.4%: Orders for manufactured 
goods boomed at the end of 1993, the Commerce Department reported, with strong 
demand for new cars and commercial aircraft propelling orders for a fourth 
straight month to a seasonally adjusted $262 billion. The gain was the biggest 
monthly increase since June, when orders surged 2.9%, and follows a 1.2% 
October gain. The increase was widespread, ranging from cars and computers to 
food and paper products.

PEOPLE: NEGOTIATIONS BETWEEN TURNER PICTURES AND DAWN STEEL ARE REPORTEDLY OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Independent film producer Dawn Steel won't be heading Ted Turner's film unit, 
as had been expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said Wednesday that talks between Steel and Turner Pictures have ended 
after weeks of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Details were sketchy, but there had been speculation that Steel wanted more 
autonomy than Turner was willing to give her. 
</P>
<P>
 Steel is expected to concentrate on producing. She scored a big hit last year 
with "Cool Runnings," a comedy about a Jamaican bobsledding team competing in 
the Olympic Games. She also was a producer of Disney's "Sister Act 2."  
</P>
<P>
 Steel is also expected to devote time to keeping film production in the Los 
Angeles area. Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan has asked her to organize a 
task force to examine the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood executives have speculated that Steel might rejoin Paramount 
Pictures if QVC Network Inc. Chairman Barry Diller wins the battle for control 
of Paramount Communications Inc., but Steel told The Times last month that 
Diller had not approached her about running Paramount. JAMES BATES TLC Beatrice 
International Holdings Inc., the nation's biggest minority-owned company, said 
Loida Nicolas Lewis, widow of founder Reginald F. Lewis, will become chairman 
Feb. 1. Lewis will replace Jean Fugett Jr., the current chairman and chief 
executive and a half-brother of Reginald Lewis. The company said it has started 
a search for a new CEO. New York-based Beatrice is a multinational food company 
with operations principally in Western Europe. Leo C. Wolinsky has been named 
metropolitan editor of the Los Angeles Times. He will be responsible for 
directing full-run coverage of news in Los Angeles County and throughout 
California and Nevada. Wolinsky, 44, has been city editor since August, 1991. 
During his tenure, The Times' staff won a Pulitzer Prize for the paper's 
coverage of the riots that followed the Rodney King beating trial verdict. 
Wolinsky joined The Times in 1977 as a reporter and has served as assistant 
bureau chief in Sacramento. He reports to Carol Stogsdill, senior editor.

ACURA TO BUILD NEW CAR IN U.S.; JAPAN'S AUTO SALES PLUNGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a pioneering move for a Japanese car company, Honda Motor Co.'s Acura 
division said Wednesday that it will build its next luxury car in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Honda said the new model -- to premiere in 1996 -- will compete in the 
$23,000-to-$30,000 price segment of the luxury market, between its Acura 
Integra and Vigor models.The car will be built at Honda's East Liberty, Ohio, 
assembly plant for sale only in the United States and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Thomas, Acura executive vice president, said making the car in the 
United States "makes excellent business sense." He cited the strong yen, which 
has made Japanese cars more expensive in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The yen's surge has cut U.S. sales of Japanese imports, but Japanese domestic 
sales have also been off because of the country's lingering recession. 
</P>
<P>
 The plight of Japanese manufacturers was underscored in a separate report 
Wednesday from the Japan Automobile Dealers Assn., which showed domestic sales 
for 1993 down for the third year in a row and at the lowest level in six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Domestic sales of cars, trucks and buses fell 8.4% to 4.9 million vehicles, 
hitting the lowest level since the 1987 total of 4.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The figures, which do not include "mini-cars" with engines smaller than 660 
cubic centimeters, reflect the severity of Japan's recession and the 
"uncertainty consumers feel about the future," association spokesman Yoshio 
Kondo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Domestic sales have plunged 18.2% from the 1990 peak of 6 million vehicles, 
making this the industry's most extended downturn since the years immediately 
after World War II.

 Federal Regulators Delay New Nasdaq Rules: The Securities and Exchange 
Commission decided to delay until Jan. 25 the start of the National Assn. of 
Securities Dealers' trial program to limit access to a Nasdaq electronic stock 
trading system designed for small investors.The NASD, which operates Nasdaq, 
was to have begun the yearlong experiment this week. Maverick stock traders 
opposed to the new system say it will discriminate unfairly against them and 
their clients. They went to court seeking a delay, but that action is pending 
before a federal appeals court in Washington.

 Waters Seeks RTC Changes: Congresswoman Maxine Waters, inundated with 
complaints about the Resolution Trust Corp.'s West Coast office, told officials 
of the federal agency that they had better act quickly to include African 
Americans in the thrift cleanup business. The Los Angeles Democrat also urged 
the RTC's West Coast managers to broaden their efforts to modify burdensome 
mortgage loans so that homeowners facing foreclosure can save their houses and 
resume paying off loans. "I want to remove the obstacles between the RTC and 
outside world," Waters said in an interview at the agency's Newport Beach 
office.

slashed prices for its SkyTel system, sending its stock tumbling and sparking 
declines in its competitors' shares on fears of a price war.Mobile 
Telecommunication Technologies Inc.'s stock dropped $9.625, or about 37%, to 
$16.50 and was the most heavily traded stock on Nasdaq. Jackson, Miss.-based 
Mobile said it was cutting the monthly base price for its SkyTel numerical 
nationwide paging service to $39 over the next several months from the current 
$69. The company said it will see operating losses this year and next due to 
the price cutting at its SkyTel unit.

 Saturn Earns First Profit: General Motors Corp. said that after running in the 
red for 2 1/2 years, its Saturn division posted a "substantial" operating 
profit in 1993 and expects to earn even more in 1994."Saturn will exceed its 
break-even goal for 1993 and will make a sizable operating profit," said Thomas 
Mannoff, Saturn's vice president for finance. Mannoff said Saturn made its 
first profit in May, 1993, and was profitable every month since, except for 
July. Separately, GM Executive Vice President William Hoglund said the auto 
maker expects to make a decision in about two months about expanding Saturn's 
production to a second assembly plant.

 Invesco Fund Manager Fired: Denver-based Invesco Funds Group said it 
terminated John Kaweske, the well-known co-manager of the firm's Health 
Sciences and Industrial Income mutual funds, for failure to comply with 
Invesco's rules regarding approval and reporting of personal stock trades. Fund 
managers are required by law to document personal investment moves, to avoid 
conflict with the funds they manage.Invesco said it had warned Kaweske in the 
past about failing to obey its internal rules and fired him Tuesday when he 
disclosed more infractions. But the firm said there was no indication that 
Kaweske, 53, had attempted to trade in any securities ahead of the funds he 
managed and that his trades "had absolutely no impact" on his funds. Kaweske's 
lawyer, Andrew Levander, called Kaweske's infractions technical and said 
Kaweske was stunned by the firing.

VIACOM'S BID UNSWEETENED AS TAKEOVER DEADLINE NEARS; MERGERS: IF THE COMPETING 
TENDER OFFERS EXPIRE UNCHANGED ON FRIDAY, QVC WILL WIN PARAMOUNT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two days before the expiration of rival tender offers for Paramount 
Communications Inc., bankers representing the sought-after entertainment 
conglomerate said there had been no new offer from Viacom Inc., leaving QVC 
Network Inc. the leading bidder. 
</P>
<P>
 Competing tender offers for Paramount from Viacom and QVC, with which 
Paramount has signed a merger agreement, are due to expire Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A banker at Lazard Freres, which represents Paramount, said Paramount received 
no new bid from Viacom. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the moment, we're not aware of any bid," the banker said. "But the window 
is open . . . until Friday." 
</P>
<P>
 Arbitragers also said there were unconfirmed rumors that Viacom bankers were 
asking Paramount shareholders to refrain from tendering their shares Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 They said it was unclear whether any of the reports were legitimate or were a 
smoke screen aimed at depressing the value of QVC's current high cash-and-stock 
bid. 
</P>
<P>
 QVC shares rose 75 cents to close at $40.50. They sagged earlier Wednesday 
amid doubts about Viacom's ability or desire to raise its bid and concern that 
a Paramount takeover would prove costly for the home shopping network. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom closed at $47.875, off 62.5 cents. Paramount closed up 75 cents at 
$78.25. 
</P>
<P>
 The QVC bid of $92 cash for 51% of Paramount and securities for the rest is 
now worth about $9.66 billion, compared to $9.51 billion for Viacom's bid of 
$85 cash for 51% and shares for the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Times reported Wednesday that a source close to Viacom said 
Chairman Sumner Redstone was leaning against a higher bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom was said to be talking with Blockbuster Entertainment Corp. on Tuesday 
and Wednesday about additional financial backing for its bid. Spokesmen for 
both companies declined to comment on the swirl of rumors surrounding the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Blockbuster has already supplied Viacom with a $600-million cash infusion to 
help bolster its bid for Paramount. 
</P>
<P>
 A Blockbuster spokesman, asked about rumors that it had reached an agreement 
to help Viacom finance a new bid, said: "That's the first time I've heard that 
one. We don't comment on market rumors as a matter of policy." 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility of any additional Blockbuster role in Viacom's bid rests with 
Blockbuster's hard-driving chief executive, Wayne Huizenga. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts have been playing a guessing game, trying to figure out what Huizenga 
might demand from Redstone in return for an additional cash infusion of $600 
million or so. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's deadline set by Paramount for new bids will determine whether the 
contest ends after nearly four months of bitter fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 It should determine whether QVC, the home shopping network run by former 
Paramount executive Barry Diller, walks off with the prize, or whether a new 
round of bidding begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Both QVC and Viacom have made bids for the entertainment giant. QVC topped 
Viacom in a December auction held by Paramount, but Paramount retained the 
right to negotiate further with bidders. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom had been Paramount's favored suitor in the four-month takeover battle. 
But rival QVC took the matter to court, where Paramount's anti-takeover 
mechanisms were annulled, and forced the auction to be held last month. 
</P>
<P>
 By delaying any bid increase until the last minute, Viacom may be seeking to 
drive QVC's stock down on expectations that QVC would be financially burdened 
by winning Paramount and thus demonstrate tendering to QVC may be risky, some 
arbitragers said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, one said, "It would be a brilliant tactical maneuver, but I wouldn't 
give him (Redstone) that much credit." 
</P>
<P>
 He said Viacom appeared to simply be having trouble putting a deal together 
for additional financial backing. 
</P>
<P>
 Several arbitragers holding Paramount shares said they had not been contacted 
regarding any request to refrain from tendering to QVC and said they would 
refuse any such request. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will tender to QVC," said one. "I'll tender to QVC. Because we're not 
going to wait."

CALFED SAYS IT WILL DIVEST ITSELF OF FLORIDA BRANCHES; BANKING: THE THRIFT 
STILL HAS A DISTURBINGLY HIGH LEVEL OF PROBLEM LOANS, AND ITS CHANCE OF 
SURVIVAL REMAINS IN DOUBT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 California Federal Bank announced plans Wednesday to sell its 43 branches in 
Florida and raise up to $300 million in new capital, a clear signal that the 
financially troubled thrift will try to remain independent for the time being. 
</P>
<P>
 The restructuring plan, announced after a three-month study by its outside 
financial adviser, confounded some observers who thought the thrift might put 
itself up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles-based CalFed is the nation's fifth-largest savings and loan, with 
$15.7 billion in assets. It has 168 branches in four states, including 118 in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 CalFed has sustained significant losses in recent years -- including $91.8 
million in the first nine months of 1993 -- and just last March completed a 
$242-million restructuring in a bid to stay afloat. Its problem loans still 
stand at a dangerously high level, totaling about $850 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, CalFed Chief Executive Edward Harshfield said the 
restructuring provides the best potential return for shareholders. While the 
option of selling the entire thrift was studied by its investment banker, Smith 
Barney Shearson, no potential buyers were approached, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 CalFed stock has risen recently, an indication that some investors were 
expecting a "sell strategy," said Bruce Harting, a thrift analyst with Salomon 
Bros. in New York. "I think the strategy will work over the long term, and 
that's what I was expecting. But that's clearly not what the market was 
expecting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 CalFed's shares fell $.375 to $14.875 in New York Stock Exchange trading 
Wednesday. The restructuring announcement came after the market had closed.  
</P>
<P>
 The thrift intends to raise the capital through the sale of preferred stock 
and a rights offering to common stockholders. Harshfield said Florida branches 
may fetch a 3% to 5% premium on their $4 billion in deposits, or between $120 
million and $200 million. 
</P>
<P>
 CalFed's board hired Harshfield, an experienced caretaker of troubled 
institutions, after forcing out the thrift's previous chairman and president in 
July.

COMPUTER FILE: HERE'S HOW TO GOPHER A GLOBAL RIDE ON THE INTERNET; LAWRENCE J. 
MAGID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE J. MAGID is a Silicon Valley-based computer writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A lot of people talk and write about the Internet, but far fewer actually use 
it on a regular basis. That's because it's no picnic. Even experienced users of 
on-line information services such as America On-Line, Compuserve and Prodigy 
often find the Internet daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 To begin with, the Internet isn't a single computer service. It's a worldwide 
network of thousands of computers located on every continent. Once you're 
connected to the Internet, you can "cruise the digital highways" to other 
connected machines. You don't have to pay any extra fee or phone charges, 
because many libraries, universities, companies and government agencies allow 
guests to browse through their data banks, even if they don't have accounts on 
their systems. 
</P>
<P>
 You can probably get a free or low-cost account if you're affiliated with a 
college or university. Some government agencies and companies also offer 
employees access to the service. 
</P>
<P>
 Commercial Internet carriers include Delphi, The Well, Portal and Netcom. 
Netcom ((800) 501-8649), whose prices start at $17.50 a month for unlimited 
access, is the least expensive option for people who want to spend a lot of 
time on line. Delphi ((800) 695-4005) offers a plan for $10 a month that 
includes four free hours. Additional access is $4 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some Mac and Windows programs that make the Internet easier to use, 
but these require a special type of account called a SLIP (Serial Line 
Interface Protocol) or PP (Point to Point). Programs include Mosaic (Mac, 
Windows and Unix), which you can download for free, and Air Navigator 
(Windows), a commercial program for local area networks from Spry 
Communications of Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Internet will get easier to use later this year. America On-Line, a 
service for Mac, Windows and DOS users, has announced that it will offer 
limited Internet access starting this month. Several current Internet carriers, 
including Delphi and Netcom, reportedly are working on software for Windows and 
Mac users. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, there are some tools to make life easier for people who want 
to start exploring the Internet right away. 
</P>
<P>
 These work with just about all Internet services and require no special 
software to use them. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you get an account, you can access the service and these programs with 
any terminal program, including the one that comes free with Microsoft Windows. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most useful tools is Gopher, a menu system that links you to other 
Internet sites around the world. You don't have to buy or even download Gopher. 
It's available from most Internet systems just by typing the word gopher . 
</P>
<P>
 The best known of all Gophers, developed at the University of Minnesota, is 
available from most Internet providers. It can be accessed by typing "gopher 
gopher.tc.umn.edu" from any prompt. 
</P>
<P>
 There are lots of other Gopher systems, such as the one at University of 
California, Santa Cruz (type "gopher scilibx.ucsc.edu"), which give quick 
access to weather information, electronic books and other interesting material. 
</P>
<P>
 Gopher, by the way, is a triple metaphor for (1) a rodent that does its work 
by tunneling underground and out of sight, (2) go for as in "go for some 
information" and (3) the mascot of the University of Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 When you access Gopher, you get a series of menus, one of which lets you 
connect with other Gophers in Africa, Asia, Europe, North America and elsewhere 
around the world. After logging on to Netcom, I was able to use Gopher's 
various menus to log on to computer systems at Harvard and Oxford universities 
and other campuses around the world. I was also able to tap the University of 
California library system, which provides information on just about all UC 
library holdings, even those that have been around since long before the 
catalogue was kept on a computer. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Gopher option through the Library of Congress Information System makes 
it possible to peruse the library's catalogues of books, periodicals (serials), 
maps and other items. Federal legislation from past sessions of Congress (back 
to 1973) and the current one can also be obtained.

U.S. SAYS AT&T SHOULD MODIFY MCCAW FILING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bloomberg Business News 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Justice Department said American Telephone & Telegraph Co.'s proposed 
acquisition of McCaw Cellular Communications Inc. would violate the agreement 
that broke up AT&T's telephone monopoly 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T must obtain a modification of the agreement before being allowed to 
proceed with the merger, Justice Department lawyers argued in court documents 
filed Wednesday with U.S. District Judge Harold Greene. 
</P>
<P>
 The filing, which is only a recommendation, supports a motion by BellSouth 
Corp. asking Greene to declare that AT&T's $12.6-billion acquisition of McCaw 
violates the consent agreement. The Justice Department filing does not take a 
position on the merger itself, only on the question of modifying the consent 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 BellSouth's motion, filed a month ago, shifted to the courts the objections of 
the Baby Bells, which had been seeking to use the AT&T-McCaw merger as a lever 
to ease current restrictions on their own services. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven regional Bell operating companies, of which BellSouth is the 
largest, fear that the proposed merger will allow AT&T to compete with the 
Bells in providing local telephone service. AT&T was stripped of the right to 
compete in local phone arenas by a 1984 consent decree that separated AT&T's 
local phone businesses into seven independent regional companies. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Atlanta-based BellSouth said Wednesday that the company was 
disappointed that the Justice Department did not support its broader contention 
that the regional Bells should be freed from restrictions on carrying 
interstate long-distance calls.

 Surfing's up, at least in age. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfing, the San Clemente-based magazine that chronicles the sport of surfing, 
is celebrating its 30th anniversary with three "killer special collectors' 
editions." 
</P>
<P>
 If the first -- chock-full of epic surfing photos -- is any indication, the 
magazines indeed may be worth collecting. Surfing asked greats of yesterday and 
today to determine which photos would grace the issue's pages. 
</P>
<P>
 "This idea had its roots in the fact that every surfer in the world has lived 
a fantasy around the pictures he or she sees in surf mags," Editor-in-Chief 
Nick Carroll said. "Many heroic figures in surfing have felt their first 
twinges of destiny when being awe-struck by an image of a favorite surfer, surf 
spot or wave worth conquering."

 Don Reis has been appointed general manager of Pacifica Publishing, the Miller 
Freeman Inc. division in Laguna Beach that publishes Action Sports Retailer and 
Outdoor Retailer. Reis, who has worked for Road and Track, Field and Stream and 
Sunset magazines, will also direct the Action Sports and Outdoor Retailer trade 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Action Sports Retailer had been published as a glossy, four-color magazine 
that came out nine times each year. Now it is switching to a combination of 
eight editorial-only tabloid issues and four "resource" buying guide issues 
that correspond to the trade show and different retail selling seasons. 
Advertising will be accepted only in the four buying-guide issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Action Sports Retailer will focus on trends and new products that are of 
interest to store owners and operators. Circulation is being increased to 
23,000 from 15,000.

MUTUAL FUND INDUSTRY STILL DIVIDED OVER COMMISSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHET CURRIER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Through more than a half century of dramatic growth, the mutual fund 
industry's longest-running rivalry hasn't changed much. 
</P>
<P>
 It divides the business, just about evenly, between "load" funds that impose 
sales commissions in one form or another, and no-loads that are sold without 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
 To some observers, the idea that loads persist in such large numbers as the 
21st Century approaches seems incongruous, if not outrageous. In an era of 
increasing financial sophistication, they say, more and more fund investors 
ought to be avoiding all commission charges by going with no-load funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "One dictionary definition of a load is 'a heavy burden or weight,' " observes 
Sheldon Jacobs in his annual Handbook for No-Load Fund Investors. "No investor 
needs such a burden." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet no-load funds, by the latest tally of the Investment Company Institute in 
Washington, account for only about one-third of the assets under management in 
long-term stock and income funds. 
</P>
<P>
 No-loads' share has increased only gradually since 1985, when it stood at 
27.5%, and 1990, when it was a little less than 29%. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you take into account money market funds and short-term municipal bond 
funds, which are virtually all no-load, the ranks of funds without sales 
charges still make up only a little more than half of the total. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidently, there is still a lot of truth to the industry maxim that "mutual 
funds are sold, not bought" -- that many investors need or want a broker or 
salesperson to match them up with a product that suits them. 
</P>
<P>
 But whenever the relative merits of the two categories are discussed these 
days, notes Don Phillips, publisher of the Morningstar Mutual Funds reports in 
Chicago, the load forces seem to find themselves on the defensive. 
</P>
<P>
 That's at least partly their own doing, Phillips argues. He says they haven't 
stated their case effectively, and at the same time have played into their 
rivals' hands with the recent widespread strategy of creating multiple classes 
of shares. 
</P>
<P>
 In a typical instance of such a setup, class A shares continue to carry a 
front-end sales charge of, say, 5.75%, while class B shares are sold without 
commission but carry a "back-end load" or charge collected when shares are 
redeemed. 
</P>
<P>
 In a few instances, class C and D shares have also been established through 
which sales charges are imposed via a combination of front- and back-end loads, 
or through some sort of annual levy on the shareholder's account. 
</P>
<P>
 The load-fund forces maintain that these different classes give investors 
greater choice in how they wish to pay the salesperson or adviser who provides 
them with a service like that of a full-service stockbroker. 
</P>
<P>
 But Phillips doesn't see them so favorably. "Rather than advance a positive 
case for financial planning," he says, "many load-fund leaders responded to 
their critics by shuffling their commissions -- a seeming admission that their 
opponents had identified a legitimate flaw in their operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "By embracing this path of least resistance -- shifting sales charges rather 
than defending the merits of the added services they allow -- load-fund leaders 
tarnish the simplicity and elegance of the mutual-fund concept, one of their 
product's most appealing features." 
</P>
<P>
 In complicating their merchandise, Phillips argues, load-fund sponsors are 
actually encouraging more investors to opt for a do-it-yourself approach in 
no-loads. 
</P>
<P>
 That's fine for people who have the time, the desire and the knowledge they 
need to make good choices on their own, he says, but "it is certainly not the 
appropriate route for all investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Indeed, the stories from large no-load houses of investors who refuse to move 
their individual retirement accounts out of municipal bond funds (whose 
tax-exempt benefits are redundant in an IRA) suggest that some investors should 
not be handling their own accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps if full-service groups had made a positive case for financial 
planning, more investors would be getting the help they need."

PERSONAL BEST: A CLOSE-UP LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO MATTER; LIFE, LAUGHTER ADD TO 
WISDOM OF HIS WORDS 
</P>

 In a bare Glendale hospital room, Fred Bernard faced his three clients and 
friends -- all divorced or nearly divorced, all struggling to rebuild, some 
having trouble dealing with the incessantly cheery holiday season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tough time of year," Bernard told the members of the counseling group. 
"You're supposed to feel good. It's kind of an order. But you don't know who 
ordered it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard has lived through more tough times than most. At 76, he's buried two 
wives and become obsolete in his lifelong profession of textiles. Fred Bernard 
is no stranger to therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, he's the facilitator, not the client. Each week, at Glendale Memorial 
Hospital and Health Center, he meets with some of the six women and two men in 
his counseling group. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard went through the 75 hours of training and volunteered with the 
hospital's Senior Peer Counseling Program five years ago after moving to 
Glendale from New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 "I myself had personal therapy over the years, so when I began this kind of 
work I had some idea of what misery I would put the clients through," he said, 
smiling slyly. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Peer Counseling helps older adults cope with issues of aging. Bernard's 
current group, his second, first met two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Group members -- most approaching retirement age -- are more concerned about 
relationships than retirement. Last week, with only three members, loneliness, 
divorce and strained familial relationships were the common themes. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy, 60, is getting divorced and looks forward to a new chapter in her life. 
Joe, 61, is dealing with a recent divorce and an uneven relationship with his 
grown daughter. Betty, 55, divorced for nearly two decades, is just beginning 
to date again but faces conflict with her mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard met the problems with humor, blunt honesty and with a mirror, letting 
clients see and solve their own dilemmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fred has taught me how to trust, which I just couldn't get to with my other 
therapists," said Betty, who has been in counseling for more than 20 years and 
in this group for two. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting more here than I ever did." 
</P>
<P>
 "He made me feel very welcome," said Kathy, who joined the group two months 
ago. "Knowing you have this support gets you through some kinks in the week." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe agreed. "It's nice to know on Thursdays there's someone I can talk with 
openly," he said. "Fred's very insightful. He has a good way of getting you to 
see your own blind spots." 
</P>
<P>
 The groups are a chance for Bernard to reflect as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I share a lot too. I let them know we're in this together," said Bernard, who 
learns a little more about himself each two-hour session. "That's our 
(facilitators) reward. We learn so much about ourselves. When we work through 
their issues, it kicks up our own issues." 
</P>
<P>
 "(Facilitating) is not the kind of thing everybody can do," said Dr. Myrna 
Samuels, director of the peer counseling program. "Fred has a sensitivity to 
individual issues and helps people get below the surface and explore what's 
going on." 
</P>
<P>
 At an age when many senior citizens are coming to the group and individual 
counseling sessions to learn to cope with aging, fear of death and loneliness, 
Bernard doesn't have time for those worries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so busy just being busy, I don't think about that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, he received his Human Services Certificate from L.A. City College. 
This semester he will take classes in African American studies and drug 
intervention. And he continues to be a student of human nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm fascinated by the process of how we deal with ourselves, what motivates 
us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The peer counseling program is looking for more volunteers like Bernard. 
Training sessions begin Feb. 1. For more information, call Dr. Myrna Samuels at 
(818) 502-4560.

SEA VIEW LEAGUE BOYS' BASKETBALL; CORONA DEL MAR FAILS TO CONTAIN UNIVERSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This season, University's magic number has been 68, but it went nine points 
better Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 University held off Corona del Mar, 77-74, in a Sea View League opener at 
Corona del Mar behind Demetrius Zeigler's 26-point performance and Ali Amiri's 
clutch free-throw shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're 8-0 when we score 68 points or more," University Coach Mike Dinneen 
said. "We're 0-4 when we don't." 
</P>
<P>
 So there was cause for concern for the Trojans (8-4, 1-0 in league), when 
Corona del Mar led, 12-10, after one quarter before University began forcing 
the tempo. 
</P>
<P>
 Using its full-court press and half-court trapping defense, University forced 
the Sea Kings (8-5, 0-1) into a running game in the second quarter -- the teams 
combined for 61 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "That quarter was definitely more our style," Dinneen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Point guard Dan McMillan scored 12 of his 19 points in the second quarter to 
keep Corona del Mar barely ahead at halftime, 42-41. 
</P>
<P>
 Then University's pressure began to take a toll. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sea Kings handled the press well in the first half, committing only six 
turnovers. But University forced four turnovers in the first four minutes of 
the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Reserve forward Nick Sibersky, who had eight points and six rebounds, scored 
on a layup to give University the lead on its first possession of the third 
quarter, 43-42. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Hill's three-pointer for the Trojans capped a 14-4 run that gave 
University a 55-46 lead midway through the quarter. University never 
relinquished the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar tried to rally behind Ramin Bastani, who had 26 points and 
five-three pointers. Marius Sandvik, who had 10 points and 13 rebounds, scored 
after a rebound to draw Corona del Mar even, 74-74, with 33 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 But seven seconds later, Amiri drew a foul on a drive, then made both ends of 
a one-and-one to give University a 76-74 lead. Amiri finished with 16 points 
and seven assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar had a chance to tie, but after working the ball around the 
perimeter, an errant pass sailed high through McMillan's hands and went out of 
bounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsay Johnson intentionally fouled Zeigler with four seconds remaining, and 
Zeigler made one of two free throws to clinch the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made some clutch free throws at the end and Ali played well tonight," 
Dinneen said. "That's what we want him to do, penetrate and kick the ball out 
and we'll jack up the shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Dustin White benefited from Amiri's play making, hitting all three of his 
three-pointers in the second quarter while scoring 13 of his 15 points in the 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams struggled with foul trouble and the teams combined for 61 free 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor 61, Irvine 44 -- Juan Orellana had 18 points and five 
three-pointers and Paul Tayyar added 15 for host Newport Harbor (9-4, 1-0). 
Greg Foster scored 17 points for Irvine (4-8, 0-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Margarita 60, Woodbridge 44 -- Brendan Mulligan scored a game-high 23 
points, Brad Finneran added 16 points and Brian Finneran had 14 points and 12 
rebounds to lead Santa Margarita (9-4, 1-0), the 10th-ranked team in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin 66, Saddleback 49 -- Greg Logan had 20 points as Tustin (9-5, 1-0) 
outscored Saddleback 19-3 in the second quarter. Chris Bradshaw had a game-high 
22 for the Roadrunners (5-7, 0-1).

GIRLS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; VICTORY MOVES KENNEDY A STEP CLOSER TO GOAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They were two of the three teams that tied for second place in the Garden 
Grove League a year ago, so the importance of Wednesday's league opener wasn't 
lost on Santiago or Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 It especially wasn't lost on host Kennedy, which scored a 48-36 victory, the 
first step toward dethroning Rancho Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fighting Irish (8-5, 1-0) are digging in for the battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The league is a lot more equal this year, and Rancho Alamitos is the team to 
beat, but someone will step up and beat them," Kennedy Coach Karen Wolfe said. 
"Tonight was important because we accomplished 1/14th of our season goal." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe and the Irish have their cross hairs set on the Vaqueros, who opened 
league play with a 75-36 victory over Los Amigos. 
</P>
<P>
 Santiago Coach Ron Heusser agreed that Rancho Alamitos is No. 1 -- for now. 
"Kennedy is going to be there," he said. "Garden Grove and Kennedy are pretty 
equal. And Pacifica could be tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Making every victory invaluable amid all that parity. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy's victory came with a zone defense that pushed Santiago (4-8, 0-1) 
toward the outer reaches of its shooting range; the Cavaliers shot 18% in the 
first three quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Heather Cunningham led Kennedy with 12 points and nine rebounds, and 
sophomore Leslie Prochaska had nine points and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Santiago led, 6-4, against Kennedy's pressure defense, but when the Irish went 
to the zone, Santiago's shooting went in the tank: The Cavaliers went 6 minutes 
25 seconds without a field goal and fell behind, 20-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Santiago closed to within six, 24-18, at halftime, but a 10-0 run opening the 
third quarter put the game away. Santiago made only one of 14 field goals in 
the quarter, a basket by Alejandra Torres, who had 10 points and nine rebounds. 
Cari Remmel had 10 points and eight rebounds for Santiago. MARTIN HENDERSON

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / SCOTT MILLER: BASEBALL ARRIVES TO SAVE THE DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the middle of Cal State Fullerton's basketball game last week with Oklahoma 
Baptist, the No. 1-ranked NAIA team in the nation, an Oklahoma Baptist stat 
girl turned to Tim Murphy with a question. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are you guys ranked?" the girl innocently asked Murphy, who helps out 
the Titan sports information department. 
</P>
<P>
 Uh, how low do the rankings go? The Titans, 2-8, have yet to defeat a Division 
I team this season. 
</P>
<P>
 But if they teach you one thing in the sports information business, it is to 
accentuate the positive. Where are the Titans ranked? Murphy didn't blink. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're third in College Sports, fifth in Collegiate Baseball and sixth in 
Baseball America," he shot back. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, baseball: Just when things appear hopeless at Fullerton, there is always 
baseball. And the Titans, expecting big things this year since they have nearly 
the entire pitching staff back, start practice today in preparation for their 
Jan. 28 opener at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're excited," associate head coach George Horton said, with good reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting pitchers Dan Ricabal (11-3, 3.48 earned-run average last year), Mike 
Parisi (10-3, 4.71) and Derek Fahs (3-3) are all back. 
</P>
<P>
 So are Jon Ward, who was promising as a freshman last season in starting and 
relief roles, Ted Silva, who was 4-2 with seven saves, and Chad Rolish, who was 
consistent in relief and then, in his only start, worked a splendid game in the 
NCAA Regionals as Fullerton shut out McNeese State, 2-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Add All-American outfielder Dante Powell, who batted .335 last year with 12 
homers, 57 RBIs and a team-leading 42 stolen bases, and several other returning 
players, and the high rankings are easily explained. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other than the obvious things -- getting as far along as we can -- we need 
some questions answered," Horton said. "There are still some jobs to be won. 
There are some very competitive battles as for who our top nine players will 
be. We think we have a pretty good idea, but you can't count anyone out." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most significant questions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Who will step up and replace second baseman Jeremy Carr and shortstop Nate 
Rodriquez? Both finished their eligibility last year. The leading candidate at 
second is Jeff Ferguson, who played third last year. At shortstop, freshman 
Jack Jones leads the pack. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Assuming Ferguson makes the transition to second, who does that leave to 
play third? The early leader is Craig Skyberg, who batted .200 in 10 games last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Who will replace Carr as the team's leadoff hitter? That slot is open right 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Aside from Powell, who is a fixture in center field, who will be the other 
two outfielders? Jim Betzsold, who played right last year, has the inside track 
again, but that hinges on the continued recovery of his arm. He hurt it over 
the summer while pitching. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be plenty of practice time for Horton and Coach Augie Garrido to 
assess things. The Titans will practice 6 1/2 hours a day until the Jan. 28 
opener nears. Then, once school resumes on Jan. 31, the NCAA maximum of 20 
practice hours a week begins.  
</P>
<P>
 And if all of these questions aren't sorted out by the time the season opens, 
Fullerton's pitching should be solid enough to buy some time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope (pitching is a strength)," Horton said. "If it isn't, we're in 
trouble. We've got some of our better athletes there, and they've got 
experience now. Youth is not an excuse. They've experienced national 
competition, the NCAA Regionals, they've played at Florida State and Texas." 
</P>
<P>
 And, they've experienced the expectations. The Titans have reached the point 
where high rankings are nothing new. They were ranked as high as third 
nationally at one point last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect to go to Omaha (for the College World Series)," Horton said. "So we 
should be ranked in the top eight. If we don't go to Omaha, we'll look back on 
the year and say we didn't succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sundance Kids: Garrido and Horton have been keeping close tabs on the weather 
reports and, so far, it looks dry for later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We spent the first eight days of practice last year indoors," said Horton, 
who has reserved gym time again this year just in case. "We had all these plans 
. . . " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Let's See: Ways for the Fullerton basketball team to make better use of its 
time during the first half of games: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Install a television in the locker room, turn on reruns of "The Andy 
Griffith Show" and don't bother coming out for the first 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Catch up on homework. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Reread fine print of scholarship papers. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Compare and contrast the writing crafts of Howard Stern and Rush Limbaugh, 
focusing on their literary allusions and high-quality metaphors. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not? Anything would be better than stepping on the court for the opening 
tipoff. Among Fullerton's first-half transgressions this season: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Getting behind UC Irvine, 27-7, on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Falling behind Oklahoma Baptist, 26-12, last week. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Shooting 39% and committing 13 turnovers against Northern Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Shooting 27% against Colorado State. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Falling behind St. Mary's, 29-13. 
</P>
<P>
 The list goes on; you get the drift. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've shown that we're a slow starting team this year and I don't understand 
why," Holland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Outfielder Dante Powell was named to Baseball America's preseason All-American 
team this week. . . . The baseball team has added an exhibition game to its 
schedule, against Waseda University of Tokyo on March 3 at Titan Field. . . . 
Junior Marissa Frial had a career-high 25 points during the Fullerton women's 
basketball team's 88-76 loss at UC Santa Barbara on Monday. Shayla Bradshaw led 
the Titans with 27. . . . The annual Titan alumni baseball game is scheduled 
for 1 p.m. Jan. 16 on Titan Field.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE BASKETBALL; FINAL REBOUND SAVES SADDLEBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it came time for a game-saving rebound, it was no surprise that 
Saddleback's Antoine Jefferson had the ball in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson had 20 points and 21 rebounds as Saddleback opened Orange Empire 
Conference play with a 72-71 victory over host Fullerton Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback's Eric Amborzich was at the free-throw line with two seconds left 
and the Gauchos up, 72-71. He missed both attempts, but Jefferson rebounded the 
second miss and time ran out. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was key," Saddleback Coach Bill Brummel said. "That way, we didn't have 
to survive a half-court shot." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton had a much better chance to win the game a few seconds earlier. 
Fullerton got the ball with 23 seconds left because Amborzich was called for 
traveling. 
</P>
<P>
 After a timeout, the Hornets worked the ball around and guard Bobby Natoya 
drove toward the basket with about seven seconds left. The Saddleback defense 
moved around him, so he passed to the left corner where Kevin Carlson was 
unattended. 
</P>
<P>
 But Carlson, who had a game-high 22 points, missed short and the ball bounced 
out of bounds with three seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a really important game to win," Brummel said. "In this conference 
any road victory is key." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton (15-5, 0-1) was impressive early, opening a 21-13 lead. But 
Saddleback got under control and rallied to lead, 40-31, at the half. Jefferson 
had 10 points and Sean Warren came off the bench for six in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback (11-5, 1-0) stretched the lead to 47-33 two minutes into the second 
half before Fullerton turned the tide. The Hornets went on a 17-3 run to tie 
it, 50-50, with 12:12 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton continued its strong play and Carlson had a three-point play off a 
steal and an assist by Tamar Ross and Fullerton was ahead, 64-59, with about 
five minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback rallied on free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gauchos made five field goals in the second half, but made 21 of 23 free 
throws in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson was eight of 10 and Amborzich made six of eight. Saddleback's final 
15 points of the game came on free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was horrible on free throws last season," Jefferson said. "That was 
something I worked on all summer." 
</P>
<P>
 In other Orange Empire Conference men's games: 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Valley 111, Orange Coast 105 -- Tom Airey scored a game-high 32 points, 
including 10 three-pointers, Rashad Wilson had 20 points, and Damon Sims added 
18 to lead Irvine Valley (13-6, 1-0) at Capistrano Valley High School. Derek 
Roche had 30 points, including nine three-pointers, and five assists and 
Chauncey Woolridge added 26 points and nine rebounds for Orange Coast (10-6, 
0-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago 82, Cypress 55 -- Sean Amos made nine of 12 and finished with 
20 points for visiting Rancho Santiago (13-5, 1-0), which ended a two-game 
losing streak. Amos also had 11 rebounds. Matt Kenney had five three-pointers 
and finished with 18 points for Cypress (9-11, 0-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside 91, Golden West 75 -- Darryle Flicking, averaging 32.9 points, 
scored 46 points, including eight three-pointers, a single-game Riverside 
record. Riverside is 15-4, 1-0. Gerald Rhoden scored 20 for Golden West (7-10, 
0-1). 
</P>
<P>
 In nonconference women's games: 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West 56, Riverside 49 -- Michelle Kravik had 20 points and Deana Itow 
added 17 for visiting Golden West (19-3, 1-0). Riverside beat Golden West, 
65-45, in the title game of the Fullerton tournament Dec. 30, which was the 
last game for both teams. Julie Jones and Kristin Brun had 11 rebounds each for 
Golden West. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress 81, Rancho Santiago 39 -- Jennifer Johnson had 18 points and 16 
rebounds and Yolanda Hearvey added 12 points and 14 rebounds for visiting 
Cypress (16-4, 1-0). Griselda Cervantes scored 10 points for Rancho Santiago 
(3-9, 0-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton 59, Saddleback 41 -- Visiting Fullerton (13-9, 0-1) had seven 
players score six or more points. Lisa Ruppe had nine points and Valory 
Widdison had 11 rebounds for Fullerton. Amy Feniello had 16 for Saddleback 
(5-8, 0-1).

COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK: CONCORDIA'S HOME COURT INCLUDES 
HAZELWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeing Concordia forward Brian Hazelwood down on the hardwood is usually not 
cause for alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 Concordia Coach Greg Marshall has seen Hazelwood go scrambling after the ball 
plenty of times in Hazelwood's four years as a starter. Hazelwood, who played 
strong safety on his high school football team, has a similar image on the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Hazelwood fell hard in the second half of Tuesday's game against 
Pomona-Pitzer, Marshall wasn't worried at first. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like he's always on the floor for some reason or another," Marshall 
said. "We were waiting for him to hop up. When he didn't, we were really 
concerned for a while there." 
</P>
<P>
 Hazelwood, who was entangled with a Pomona-Pitzer player while going for a 
rebound and landed directly on his hip, knew it wasn't a routine fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember just lying there and the pain that I felt," Hazelwood said. "I 
have taken harder hits in football, but I've never experienced that amount of 
pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really couldn't feel my legs. I thought that it was going to be the last 
game I would play." 
</P>
<P>
 As a precaution, Hazelwood was taken off the court on a back board and 
paramedics were summoned to take him to Irvine Medical Center. He was released 
from the hospital that night after being told he had suffered a bad bruise and 
strained muscles in his back. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that night, Marshall got a telephone call from Hazelwood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing he said was, 'What time is practice tomorrow?' " Marshall 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that was a joke. We think. 
</P>
<P>
 Hazelwood says he is sore but can walk -- slowly -- and has been told to sit 
out of practice for several days. He hopes to play in the Eagles' game Saturday 
against Occidental. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to do my best (to play)," Hazelwood said. "This is my last year, so 
I want to get in as much as I can. I'll see how it feels (today). As of now, 
I'm going to play Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hazelwood, a 6-foot-4 forward who is averaging 10.1 points and 6.9 rebounds, 
has been the Eagles' most consistent player and is one of the main reasons they 
are 9-5 entering the final game before Golden State Athletic Conference play 
opens Tuesday at Fresno Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hazelwood says he is still trying to shake a bad reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still feel I have to prove something to some of the other coaches," he 
said. "My first couple of years here I took it to extremes to play 
aggressively, and I've been kind of labeled as being a dirty player. It kind of 
aggravates me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to break the mold and just play hard." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the hoedown: Hazelwood's injury might prove damaging to an accidental 
country dance career. 
</P>
<P>
 It all started when he and his girlfriend, Deanne Robuck, were swing dancing 
at a Lake Forest country bar and they were approached by a man who asked if 
they would like to dance in Stanford Stadium before an exhibition soccer match 
between the U.S. national team and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 They were skeptical. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a bar and you think, 'This guy has had too much to drink,' " 
Hazelwood said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the talent scout turned out to be sober, and Hazelwood and Robuck 
performed before the game, in front of a crowd that would eventually grow to 
52,397. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, they have been invited to perform during a dinner for the U.S. team in 
Mission Viejo Jan. 12, and there is the possibility of dancing during the World 
Cup this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what I understand -- and again this is one of those skeptical things -- 
they want us to perform in some of the halftime shows in the games around 
here," Hazelwood said. 
</P>

 The Chapman men's basketball team will be tested tonight by Redlands, the NCAA 
Division III version of Loyola Marymount circa 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs, who regularly lead Division III in scoring, are averaging 101.9 
points. But they are giving up 97.1 and have lost five in a row after a 4-0 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those losses was to Chapman -- 106-101 -- on Dec. 10 at the Hutton 
Center. Tonight the Panthers (7-4) play at Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Division III schools are scheduled to rule on Chapman's application to switch 
from Division II (Division I in baseball) to Division III next week at the NCAA 
Convention in San Antonio. Chapman President James Doti and Athletic Director 
Dave Currey will be on hand for the vote. . . . The Golden State Athletic 
Conference is starting men's and women's basketball play Tuesday. Southern 
California College is playing host to Azusa Pacific and Concordia is playing at 
Fresno Pacific. The women's games start at 5:30 p.m.; the men at 7:30.

RECRUITING / JEFF FELLENZER: ROSE BOWL DEFEAT DOESN'T DIMINISH BRUINS' SALES 
PITCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FELLENZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bolstered by its first Rose Bowl appearance in eight years, UCLA is off to a 
good start in football recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Although players cannot sign letters of intent until Feb. 2, Coach Terry 
Donahue and his staff have unwritten commitments from 10 players. 
</P>
<P>
 USC, rebuilding under Coach John Robinson after several sub-par recruiting 
efforts by former coach Larry Smith and his staff, has concentrated on filling 
specific needs and adding depth to both lines by recruiting community college 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA, which lost to Wisconsin, 21-16, in the Rose Bowl, has been actively 
recruiting out of state, especially the Midwest and Texas. And for good reason. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a great year in California," says Dick Lascola, who runs the 
Fallbrook, Calif.-based Scouting Evaluation Assn. "The strength of this class 
is the skill kids -- running backs, wide receivers and defensive backs. There 
are virtually no quarterbacks, after Steve Campbell (Norco High) and Steve Buck 
(Alta Loma High), a handful of linemen and no linebackers. Overall, it's pretty 
lean." 
</P>
<P>
 USC has also been recruiting extensively in Texas, and both USC and UCLA could 
be helped by the five-year NCAA probation against the Texas A&M football 
program that was handed down Wednesday. (However, the Aggies are prohibited 
from appearing on television and going to a bowl game only next season.) Texas 
A&M has been the one Southwest Conference school in recent years that has 
consistently recruited well in-state. 
</P>
<P>
 Just this week, USC received a commitment from one of the top players in 
Texas, defensive lineman Cedric Jefferson (6-3, 270) of Ft. Worth, who also 
visited Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins are hoping to sign 20 players, an increase from their previously 
stated goal of 17 or 18. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's 10 commitments: quarterback Steve Buck (6-feet-4, 180) of Alta Loma; 
defensive back-wide receiver Glenn Thompkins (5-9, 165) and offensive lineman 
Rick Austin (6-3, 300) of Rialto Eisenhower; running back-safety Shaun Williams 
(6-2, 185) of Encino Crespi; defensive lineman Danjuan Magee (6-3, 260) of Long 
Beach Poly; tight end-linebacker Mike Grieb (6-4, 220) of San Jose Oak Grove; 
tight end-defensive end Robert Arthur (6-5, 230) of Brownsboro, Tex.; defensive 
back Akil Davis (6-feet, 180) of Mesa, Ariz.; safety DuVal Hicks (6-2, 195) of 
Benicia, Calif., and punter Justin Sogoian (6-4, 195) of Orange Coast College. 
Sogoian, who attended La Quinta High in Westminster, was an all-state selection 
who averaged 42.7 yards a kick last season. He also visited USC. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Newhall Hart linebacker-tight end John McLaughlin (6-4, 220) says 
that UCLA and Notre Dame are his top choices. Florida State, Arizona and 
Nebraska are also among his list of schools. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA and Notre Dame are also the top choices of talented running back Ty Goode 
(6-1, 185) of Southeast High in Lincoln, Neb. Goode rushed for 1,494 yards and 
30 touchdowns last season, but is considered an even better prospect at safety. 
So far, he has resisted pressure to stay home and commit to Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 Latest to sign with the Trojans are defensive end Marcus Bonds (6-6, 235) of 
West Los Angeles, offensive lineman Richard Beatie (6-6, 290) of Glendale and 
defensive back Mario Bradley (6-2, 180) of Cerritos. That group joins two 
earlier community college signees, wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson (6-4, 205) of 
West Los Angeles and linebacker Errick Herrin (6-3, 230) of Mt. San Jacinto. In 
addition, two other community college standouts have made commitments to sign 
with USC next month: offensive lineman Heath Baughman (6-7, 290) of Bakersfield 
and fullback Reggie Brown (6-1, 235) of College of the Desert. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Jefferson, other high school players who have reportedly made 
commitments to the Trojans include standout running back-defensive back Rodney 
Sermons (6-feet, 180) of La Puente Bishop Amat, defensive end George Perry 
(6-6, 235) of San Bernardino and offensive lineman David Caldwell (6-6, 310) of 
Oakland. Next to commit may be defensive back-wide receiver Leon Blunt (5-10, 
180) of San Fernando. Blunt made an unwritten commitment to Notre Dame during a 
recruiting visit last month, but has since reconsidered. He recently visited 
UCLA, but has told friends that he will eventually sign with USC. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Around the Southland: Van Nuys Montclair Prep running back-defensive back 
Wilbert Smith (5-8, 185), the third-leading rusher in the state last season 
with 2,504 yards, has made an unwritten commitment to attend Illinois. The 
Illini also may be the leader for Rialto Eisenhower running back Marlon Farlow 
(5-11, 175). Notre Dame is among the schools recruiting Farlow . . . Newhall 
Hart wide receiver-defensive back Soren Halladay (6-2, 185) has committed to 
Brigham Young . . . Palos Verdes Peninsula tackle Matt Redman (6-7, 285) raised 
some eyebrows when he committed to Iowa recently after recruiting trips to 
California and Colorado. Redman's parents, grandparents, aunt and uncle 
attended Cal, which was considered the front-runner to sign him. Peninsula's 
other "twin tower," guard John Welbourn (6-6, 275), has visited Cal and 
Nebraska and has trips scheduled this month to UCLA and USC and Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw High fullback-linebacker Dennis Fomond (5-11, 210) is scheduled to 
visit Cal this weekend. He also has trips planned to UCLA, Nevada Las Vegas and 
Hawaii. He may also visit USC or Arizona . . . Jefferson High tight 
end-linebacker John Johnson (6-4, 210) has visited Arizona and Kansas and has 
trips planned to Oregon, Washington and Hawaii. UCLA has been recruiting him, 
but he reportedly wants to leave the Los Angeles area . . . One of the better 
offensive line prospects in Southern California, Terry Williams (6-6, 260) of 
Placentia El Dorado, is considering UCLA, USC, Cal, Arizona State and Colorado. 
Williams' brother Steve lettered at UCLA as an offensive lineman in 1981-83 . 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Poly two-way lineman Brandon Whiting (6-3, 260), the son of Poly 
co-coach Thomas Whiting, will also visit Cal this weekend. He has taken a trip 
to Stanford and has one scheduled to Colorado. Two other Poly standouts, 
cornerbacks Kelly Malveaux (5-8, 175) and Lamont Morgan (6-1, 170), are being 
heavily recruited. The speedy Malveaux has visited Cal and Arizona and has 
trips planned to Washington, Colorado and Fresno State. Morgan is considering 
Oregon, Fresno State and Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the Pac-10: Cal has received a commitment from quarterback Trevor 
Thompson (6-4, 190) of Thousand Oaks. Thompson chose the Bears over Fresno 
State, New Mexico and Colorado State. Cal now has at least six commitments: 
tight end-linebacker Tony Gonzalez (6-6, 230) of Huntington Beach (who also 
plans to play basketball); safeties David Burnside (6-2, 175) of Milpitas, 
Calif., Mark Borr (6-1, 190) of Sacramento and Marquis Smith (6-1, 195) of San 
Diego Patrick Henry; fullback Rudy Mattox (6-1, 210) of Pinole Valley and 
community college offensive lineman Derrick Barton (6-8, 295) of San Bernardino 
Valley. In addition, the Bears have re-entered the picture for All-American 
defensive lineman Darrell Russell (6-5, 290) of San Diego St. Augustine, 
perhaps the premier prospect in California. Russell has canceled his trip to 
Miami and will visit Cal instead. He has been to USC and UCLA and also plans to 
visit Notre Dame and Michigan . . . Stanford has received commitments from 
offensive linemen Brian Donahue (6-5, 250) of Albuquerque, N.M., and Geoff 
Wilson (6-6, 255) of Robertsdale, Ala. Donahue chose the Cardinal over USC. 
Wilson was also recruited by Alabama, Auburn, Notre Dame, Georgia Tech and 
Louisiana State. However, Stanford lost standout running back-defensive back 
Tim Dwight (5-8, 155) of Iowa City, Iowa, to the hometown Hawkeyes. Dwight 
visited Stanford last month. 
</P>
<P>
 More Pac-10: Arizona has signed community college tight end Damon Terrell 
(6-4, 235) of El Camino. Terrell, who attended Serra High in Gardena, caught 47 
passes for 588 yards last season. The Wildcats received an unwritten commitment 
from wide receiver Jim Romero (5-9, 170) of Sepulveda L.A. Baptist. Romero, who 
chose Arizona over Washington, caught 86 passes for 1,570 yards and 15 
touchdowns last season . . . Despite the presence of a top-notch freshman 
quarterback, Jake Plummer, Arizona State has received a commitment from highly 
regarded quarterback Steve Campbell (6-7, 220) of Norco. Two of Campbell's 
teammates, offensive linemen Mike Barnes (6-4, 250) and Troy Davis (6-4, 235), 
also committed to the Sun Devils. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, which has been severely hampered by NCAA probation limiting its 
scholarship allotment and official campus recruiting visits, has concentrated 
on in-state players. The Huskies now have eight commitments: offensive linemen 
Ben Kadletz (6-4, 270) of La Canada St. Francis, running back-defensive back Ty 
Fotheringill (5-10, 170) of Kelso, Wash., wide receiver Marvin Kasim (5-9, 170) 
of Seattle, linebacker Chad Wright (6-3, 225) of Fife, Wash., offensive lineman 
Aaron Dalan (6-7, 285) of Sequim, Wash., defensive lineman Josh Smith (6-6, 
225) of Bellingham, Wash., and community college offensive linemen Matt Hicks 
(6-6, 295) and Eugene Seminavaga (6-5, 290) of Cerritos. The Huskies' 
recruiting class would be helped considerably if they can sign standout 
offensive line prospects Tony Coats (6-6, 275) and Benji Olson (6-4, 280), 
teammates from South Kitsap High in Port Orchard, Wash. Olson has already 
visited Washington, and Coats will be in Seattle this weekend. Coats is also 
considering Stanford and Notre Dame.

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: A DOWN-TO-EARTH LOOK AT ALIEN EXPERIENCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER, Wendy Miller is editor of Ventura County Life. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People have always talked about funny things -- odd things, often scary things 
-- in the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 The things -- oblong, phosphorescent, rimmed in multicolored lights -- have 
inspired tales of terror from witnesses, pitting respectable citizens against 
each other and, at times, their own government. Indeed, the UFO phenomenon 
continues to provoke sometimes acrimonious debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who claim sightings and abductions are considered by many to be crazy, 
plain and simple. Others who simply believe in life from outer space are, shall 
we say, discreet -- for fear of being called insane. 
</P>
<P>
 Others not only believe in UFOs but argue with conviction that the U. S. 
government has for decades conspired to pull the wool over our night eyes 
(apparently in fear that a citizenry told the startling truth about alien life 
would be reduced to mass hysteria, even anarchy). 
</P>
<P>
 This is powerful stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 And perhaps all the more today, as emboldened people share their stories and 
experiences in public meetings devoted to the subject. Psychologists have 
become involved, employing hypnosis to recover memories of brief, sometimes 
not-so-brief, encounters of an unknown kind. But even their contributions raise 
eyebrows, eliciting jeers as well as cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura writer Jane Hulse, a regular contributor to Ventura Life, went 
straight to the center of this roiling subject, in Thousand Oaks, where a local 
group dedicated to the subject meets regularly. She returned with testimonies 
not only of bizarre lights in the night skies over the Oxnard Plain but of 
abduction and abuse by aliens described in vivid detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Hulse not only brought back a fascinating look at the subject but also a 
changed sensibility about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went in kind of pooh-poohing it, being cynical," she said. "But I came out 
of it more respectful. There are some very credible people studying the 
phenomenon, and it does deserve to be studied more fully." 
</P>
<P>
 You'll have to make up your mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in this issue, Hulse parses out, for parents, the real requirements 
of the new bicycle helmet law. Many of our kids will surely be disappointed to 
have to don helmets, but there are things we can do to make buying and using 
the helmet a successful team effort. 
</P>
<P>
 And contributor Bill Locey profiles the Buds, a rock group featuring Buddy 
Sklar on bass and Chet McCracken on drums. Sklar once performed with the Ike & 
Tina Turner Revue, McCracken with the Doobie Brothers. Older, wiser and yet 
still energized, these rock veterans are launching a new sound and performing 
locally -- good news for those of us who believe in renewal.

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: TRYING TO RUSTLE UP DANCE ENTHUSIASTS; CLUBS PULLING THE PLUG 
ON COUNTRY NIGHTS THAT DON'T BRING IN BIG ENOUGH CROWDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN LOEWENTHAL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When I visit the clubs, folks are always asking me about new places to dance. 
And I keep saying: Try Nicholby's Upstairs Pool Hall and Night Club for boot 
scootin' in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday nights, this Ventura club goes country all the way. Rick 
Henderson teaches and spins tunes for dancing on a spacious, newly refinished 
floor. The club occupies the entire second floor of a huge warehouse-like 
structure, so there's no danger of feeling claustrophobic. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't dance, there are 10 pool tables to amuse you. And now, in 
addition to a great Italian coffee bar, Nicholby's serves spirits. Everyone who 
has visited the place agrees it has great potential. And they liked the airy 
atmosphere. So mosey on over Wednesday for a two-step and cappuccino. 
</P>
<P>
 But heads up, dance fans. Don't wait too long. Club owners have been pulling 
the plug on country nights if patrons don't quickly show their support. 
Regrettably, Nicholby's is no exception. Wednesday nights are going strong. But 
they've suspended the newly created country nights on Sundays. So don't expect 
to see Shiloh or any other band play Sunday as scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 Another recent casualty occurred New Year's Eve, when David Graves taught line 
dance lessons for the last time at the Black Angus Restaurant in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are teen-agers supposed to go?" asked 17-year-old Amber Mahoney of 
Camarillo. "I'm already out of high school, but I can't drink. You can go to 
Golf 'N Stuff just so many times. And how many movies can you see? So where do 
they expect us to go if we're underage? It was fun dancing there with my 
friends on Wednesdays or the weekends." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I'm no prophet -- just an ordinary gal. But I see a trend developing. If 
dancers fail to support what Garth Brooks calls your local chapter of the 
American Honky Tonk Bar Assn., dance fans will encounter fewer clubs and longer 
drives. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, despite family nights created by some clubs, country dance activity 
is moving away from the honky tonk image and branching off to 
multi-generational, family-oriented venues. And many places provide smoke and 
alcohol-free environments. So watch for dances and classes offered at places 
like the Moose Lodge in Ventura or Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Country Lovers Western Dance Club holds monthly public dances at the American 
Legion Hall in Ventura.

 An industry fanned by hundreds of books and documentaries and millions of 
worshiping fans continues to grow around long-dead entertainment personalities 
Marilyn Monroe and Elvis Presley. One reason is they both died young under 
perceived suspicious circumstances. People are deadly serious about the 
ephemera they collect related to these two tragic figures, and channelers 
insist that they chat with Marilyn and Elvis! 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Brenda Davidson of Ventura, humorist, columnist, investigative reporter 
and author of the hilarious "New Wives Tales," collects Elvis memorabilia 
"because I've always been attracted to bright, shiny objects, and I'm a big fan 
of really bad taste." 
</P>
<P>
 Davidson has visited Presley's Graceland, where she acquired some of the items 
for a traveling exhibit that has been displayed in Ventura libraries and now is 
installed in the window of the Earthling Bookshop in Santa Barbara. Davidson, 
who has taken up impersonating Elvis to get her through her midlife crisis, 
says, "I'm the only one in Ventura doing 'Elvis, the cleavage years.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Meet Davidson in her couturier Elvis outfit and Laura Kath, author of 
"Graceland, The Official Guide," at 7 p.m. Saturday at the Earthling to 
celebrate Elvis' birthday. While you're there, join in the Elvis look-a-like 
contest.

NIGHT LIFE: DON'T WORRY, THESE 3 ARE PROFESSIONALS; VETERANS OF STAGE AND 
STUDIO, THE BUDS PLAY THE BLUES IN REGULAR WEEKEND SETS AT THE HUNGRY HUNTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL LOCEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There's a bar in the basement of the Hungry Hunter restaurant in Thousand 
Oaks. Not one of the more famous rock venues in the Western Hemisphere, it's 
still the place to find the Buds playing rockin' blues Friday and Saturday 
night. So give it a break: Lana Turner was supposedly discovered in a 
drugstore. This prime rib restaurant has better food than Schwab's -- and far 
better music. 
</P>
<P>
 Bassist Buddy Sklar, drummer Chet McCracken and guitarist Chris Pinnick have, 
cumulatively, been in about a million bands. Sklar's famous past groups include 
the Leaves and the Spencer Davis Group. McCracken made a zillion bucks with the 
Doobie Brothers, and Pinnick was in the band Chicago for seven or eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris, Chet and I have known each other for about 20, 25 years," said Sklar 
during a recent phone interview. "Chet and Chris are in the studio every day, 
plus they sell teaching videos. Together, we've done a lot of soundtracks and 
commercials, plus we've played tracks for a lot of bands that you wouldn't 
expect, like Poison, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last couple of years, we were the core band at the Chicago Blues 
Festival. There'd be something like 30 artists, but none of them brought their 
bands, so we backed them up. We backed up people like Buddy Guy, B.B. King, 
Albert Collins and Albert King. Just name a song, and we can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 As a teen-ager in the Valley, Sklar flunked one of those early D.A.R.E. 
scenarios. He wouldn't stay out of bars, and he wouldn't quit rocking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was originally playing around the Valley, and I started to get pretty good 
on the bass," he said. "I ended up playing with the Ike & Tina Turner Revue in 
1965 or so, when I was 15. I had a fake ID. Ike was a trip, man. Every time 
you'd hit a bad note, he'd fine you. It was something like 25 bucks, and we 
only made 15. But he wasn't that sharp -- it was only when he caught you. But 
it was through Ike Turner that I met Jimmy Reed, and I ended up playing with 
him, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Sklar was right there when all those L.A. bands took off in the silly 
psychedelic '60s. He was a member of the Leaves, the first L.A. band to have a 
hit with "Hey Joe," a song that was later recorded by such artists as Love, 
Jimi Hendrix, the Music Machine, the Enemies and the Surfaris. 
</P>
<P>
 "I joined the Leaves after their first album came out, then moved on to a band 
called the Hook," said the bass player. "That's where I met Chet McCracken -- 
he was the drummer for the Hook. That band was sort of a power trio like Cream. 
We must've played the Whiskey about 25 times and released an album on Uni 
Records. 
</P>
<P>
 "After that band, Chet went on to play jazz gigs before joining the Doobie 
Brothers, and I played with Joe Walsh and the James Gang plus a lot of those 
L.A. folk-rock bands. Then I played with Spencer Davis and Stevie Winwood. That 
band had hits like 'I'm A Man' and 'Gimme Some Lovin.' Those were the days of 
the liquid light shows, strobe lights and all that stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Around 1970 or so Sklar discovered Pinnick -- and not a moment too soon for 
Pinnick's mom and the neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day, I was leaving the park in Reseda when I heard some incredible guitar 
playing," said Sklar. "It was the greatest guitar playing I had ever heard in 
my life; I mean, this guy was incredible. So I knocked on the door and his mom 
said 'I know, I've been telling that kid to shut up.' I asked Chris if he 
wanted to be in a band. That guy's beyond the beyond." 
</P>
<P>
 So Pinnick joined the Spencer Davis Group, then played with the Tijuana Brass 
and eventually ended up in Chicago. The three musicians, although following 
diverse paths, always stayed in contact over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 They formed the Buds last year and began making the rounds of all the blues 
clubs in L.A. From the Bombay Bicycle Club in Burbank, the Buds traded venues 
with John Ford Coley and ended up playing the Hyatt in Westlake Village for 
three months. Now it's on to the Hungry Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can play any kind of music, but we prefer the blues. At the Hyatt, we'd do 
a jazz set, a blues set, then a set of originals. We'll do requests; we don't 
care if someone wants to hear 'Mustang Sally.' It all grows out of the same 
thing. We can play all the classic rock songs. Hell, we played on half of them, 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know a lot of current tunes, but our mainstay is the blues. We do a lot of 
Buddy Guy, Muddy Waters, Howling Wolf and Stevie Ray Vaughan-style blues. All 
of us have always dug the groove of the blues. Blues is not an unhappy thing, 
but a release of all the pressures. It's a festival of life and the bloodline 
of rock 'n' roll." 
</P>
<P>
 Also it doesn't help having connections when it comes time to shop that demo 
tape. Most bands, of course, can't get past the secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do have a demo tape, and right now we're dealing with a couple of labels. 
Hopefully, we'll have an album out this year, but there's no guarantees in the 
music business. We're not living on our past reputations, but everything you 
are now, you were then. I only sent out three demo tapes, and three labels 
responded. Hey, man, we're really having a ball, and it's really great music. 
It's just a pleasure to stay creative and stay excited about music." 
</P>
<P>
 The Buds certainly have their fans. The band used to play at Trancas, where 
all sorts of Malibu types and roving rock stars such as Gary Busey and Bonnie 
Raitt would stop by to jam. 
</P>
<P>
 "One night Willie Dixon showed up and played 'Crossroads' with us," said 
Sklar. "He told me I was the best white blues singer he'd ever heard in his 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 And finally, how come McCracken isn't in the picture? 
</P>
<P>
 "Chet went to play a gig with the Doobie Brothers. He's already a millionaire, 
but he couldn't turn this gig down. It was for King Somebody, the King of 
Somewhere -- the Doobie Brothers are (the king's) favorite band -- so he hired 
them for a New Year's Eve gig. He'll be back when we do the Hungry Hunter."

THEATER REVIEW; FUNNY 'SOCIAL SECURITY' TARGETS TODAY'S ART, STEREOTYPES OF 
AGED; BRIGHT PERFORMANCES ENLIVEN PLAZA PLAYERS' PRODUCTION OF A PLAY BY 
ACCOMPLISHED SCREENWRITER ANDREW BERGMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For their first production of 1994, Ventura's Plaza Players are presenting a 
play that's as funny as it is unambitious. While "Social Security" isn't 
exactly intellectually challenging, give the company credit for finding a 
property that hasn't been overdone by local theater groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Set in contemporary New York City, "Social Security" takes on as its main 
targets contemporary art and stereotyping of the aged. Author Andrew Bergman 
paints with a broad brush (so to speak), and in doing so manages to cover his 
targets quite thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
 While his is hardly a familiar name among playwrights, filmgoers know 
Bergman's work well -- he was a co-writer on "Blazing Saddles," and subsequent 
scripts for "The In-Laws," "The Freshman," "Soapdish" and "Honeymoon in Vegas." 
</P>
<P>
 Christy Bell and Hugh McManigal star as Barbara and David Kahn, owners of an 
upscale Manhattan art gallery. The action begins when Barbara's sister, Trudy 
Heyman (Linda Lacey), and her husband, Martin (Jereme Leslie), stop by to 
deliver the sisters' mother. Sophie (Terri Sheridan) has been living with the 
Heymans; now it's the Kahns' turn. And, of course, the Kahns want no part of 
it, aware that Sophie has been terrorizing the Heymans for years. 
</P>
<P>
 Hijinks ensue, most of them the result of a visit by Maurice Koenig (James 
Leslie), a 100-year-old, world-renowned artist. 
</P>
<P>
 McManigal and Bell are well cast as the upwardly striving youngish couple, and 
Lacey and Jereme Leslie turn in very funny performances as their more 
strait-laced counterparts from the provinces. Sheridan plays Sophie without too 
much caricature (that's good), and James Leslie deserves extra credit for 
playing a character several decades older than he is without hamming it up or 
using any of the tricks often used by amateurs (a stoop; halting speech) in the 
same circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 One cavil: The script quite clearly describes two paintings on the wall as 
solid blue and white, respectively. The choice by director Michael Maynez and 
set designers Steve Aguilar and Bill Bostick to choose multicolored abstract 
works instead turns exchanges of dialogue referring to the paintings into 
gibberish. 
</P>
<P>
 The play takes a while to get going, and the actors' timing was still off a 
bit on opening night. But overall, "Social Security" is good fun and bodes well 
for the Plaza Players' upcoming season. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "Social Security" 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Plaza Players Theater, 34 N. Palm St. (in the Livery Arts Center), 
Ventura 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Wednesday, Friday and Saturday nights at 8 p.m., through Feb. 12 
</P>
<P>
 * ETC: $7 Wednesdays, $9 Fridays and $10 Saturdays. For reservations or 
information, call 643-9460.

KIDS ON FILM: IN THE GRIM REALITY OF 'SCHINDLER'S LIST' LIES LESSON OF TRUTH; 
IN "SCHINDLER'S LIST," THE HEDONISTIC OPPORTUNIST OSKAR SCHINDLER MAKES A 
FORTUNE IN WORLD WAR II USING POLISH JEWS AS SLAVE LABOR, BUT THEN, UNABLE TO 
DENY THE MURDEROUS EVIL OF HIS NAZI FRIENDS, HE TURNS HIS ATTENTION AND PROFITS 
TO SAVING 1,100 OF HIS WORKERS FROM THE AUSCHWITZ DEATH CAMP. (RATED R)

<P>
 Normally, Eric and Samia Friedrichsen do not take their children to R-rated 
movies. But this one is different. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric, a descendant of German soldiers, and Samia, a descendant of 
Palestinians, wanted them to understand the reality of those dark years that 
horrified the world and affected their own personal history. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopefully, Samia said, the movie's emotional impact would outweigh 
intellectual arguments -- including in her homeland -- that the Holocaust never 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a grim, three-hour movie in black and white, but the children said it 
kept their interest throughout and they gained information about the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, I didn't know it was that bad," said Samia's son, Ramy Dodin, 11. "I 
didn't know so many people got killed." 
</P>
<P>
 His sister, Reema, 13, said: "You never get facts. This movie, it opens you." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to historical dates and places, she said she learned more about 
how it happened, "that they would shoot people for being educated, or just for 
really dumb reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't really believe that could actually happen. But people usually 
believe the movies they see, and I suppose it's true." 
</P>
<P>
 Reema said she recalls fellow students in the fifth grade claiming that the 
Holocaust never happened in the same way they would claim that Elvis is alive. 
Now a student in Amman, Jordan, where she is living temporarily with her 
father, she said the movie "won't make it there. Not a movie like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Reema's friend Kerstin Mikalbrown, 13, who went with the family, said that her 
father and stepmother are Jewish and that she already knew many facts about the 
Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't know how it happened. Like, they would shoot people at random. 
I didn't understand it until I saw it. I remember when (the camp commander) was 
at the window in the morning with a gun and he was just shooting people 
randomly. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Reema finished the thought: "Just to amuse himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Other powerful images that children might take away with them include those of 
other children: a boy hiding from soldiers in the sludge of an outhouse, a girl 
being ripped from her mother's arms, the heroism of a small German boy lying to 
soldiers to save his Jewish friends, the heart-ripping courage of a Jewish boy 
in the camps who witnesses the murder of an innocent man after no one admits to 
a petty theft. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know who did it," he confesses, trembling. "He did," he says pointing to 
the just-murdered man. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie's terror builds to a mid-movie climax with the liquidation of the 
Warsaw ghetto, whose scenes of chaos, fear and murder lingered longest in the 
children's minds. After that, scenes of mass slaughter and layers of bodies 
were almost numbing. 
</P>
<P>
 This is strong, frightening and sorrowful material -- for anyone at any age. 
The question for parents is, when are their own children ready for it? 
</P>
<P>
 Those who saw it agreed that it wasn't for everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, it wasn't that bad," Ramy said. "But it was scary at some points 
where there was a lot of violence." 
</P>
<P>
 He advised other children to see it if they can. "But if you don't think they 
can handle it, they shouldn't see it," he added. "I thought it was good, but it 
was very sad also." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Kerstin: "I think parents know their kids. If they think their kids can 
emotionally handle it, I think it's a really important movie for them to see."

REEL LIFE / FILMS & VIDEOS; PORNOGRAPHY CAN BE A TARGET OF VIDEO VANDALS; A 
STORE OWNER SAYS RENTERS SOMETIMES TAPE OVER EROTIC MATERIAL WITH MUNDANE 
TELEVISION FARE. HE CALLS IT A GUERRILLA TACTIC.

 Many of you may not have been paying attention Saturday when Assembly Bill 538 
entered into force. The law makes it a misdemeanor to rent a video and record 
pornographic footage over it to shock unsuspecting viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 While videos may be booby-trapped in other parts of the state, the practice 
appears to be relatively rare in Ventura County. Ernie Martel has owned Video 
Depot in Westlake and Video 4 You in Thousand Oaks for more than a decade, and 
he knows of no such incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does happen," Martel said, "is people rent adult titles and return them 
with television or something else taped over it." 
</P>
<P>
 Martel suspects the vandalism is a guerrilla tactic perpetrated by people 
opposed to pornography. None of the other genres his store carries are ever 
tampered with, and other video store owners Martel has talked with report 
similar incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a regular thing," he said. "It comes in cycles, and we can never 
find out who's doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 The tapes, which cost as much as $50, are usually destroyed after they are 
vandalized. In addition to losing the tape, Martel loses the income he would 
have generated with the copy and perhaps even the customers who are miffed when 
they expect "Debbie Does Dallas" but get Debbie Reynolds instead. 
</P>

 "Orlando," the 1993 art house hit adapted from Virginia Woolf's 1928 novel, 
proves that gender benders Michael Jackson and Madonna were way late. 
</P>
<P>
 The film begins during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I and develops over the 
next 400 years, during which time the title character, played by actress Tilda 
Swinton, wakes up to find he is a she. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not the only androgyny that goes on in "Orlando." Quentin Crisp, the 
octogenarian icon of the gay community who described himself as "England's 
stateliest homo," is cast as the Virgin Queen. 
</P>
<P>
 You may also recognize Crisp in Jonathan Demme's "Philadelphia," which debuted 
in Ventura County late last year and is now in general release. He was the 
Oscar Wilde look-alike in a party scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Reviewers called "Orlando" visually impressive and gave the film nearly 
universal praise. Those who dissented said director Sally Potter's reiterations 
about the arbitrariness of sexual roles made the film repetitive.

 It is screening at 4:30 p.m. Sunday at the Ojai Playhouse, 145 E. Ojai Ave. 
Admission is $6.

FOR THE KIDS; PICKING A BIKE HELMET IS NOT ALWAYS A SNAP; SHOP OWNERS URGE 
PARENTS TO BRING THE CHILD IN FOR A PROPER FIT. THE SAFETY HEADGEAR IS NOW THE 
LAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Some kids may think that it's nerdy, but it's the law. As of Jan. 1, kids 
under 18 are required to wear helmets when riding bikes on public streets or 
trails. 
</P>
<P>
 No more hopping on the bike and whizzing through the neighborhood bare-headed. 
In case your kid is helmet-resistant, here are a few facts to pass on about the 
new law. 
</P>
<P>
 During 1994, riders found without helmets risk only a warning from police 
officers. But beginning Jan. 1, 1995, the law gets tougher. Then, violators or 
their parents face a fine of up to $25. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the new law, bike shop owners report that helmet sales are hot. If 
you are in the market for a helmet, here are a few tips. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't buy a helmet without your child being present, recommends Jon Avery, 
owner of Avery's Open Air Bicycles in Ventura. Odds are, it probably won't fit 
-- and the fit is crucial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Also, presenting a kid with a helmet and telling him he has to wear it 
doesn't go over well," Avery said. Kids, he suggests, are more likely to wear 
them if they help choose them. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing how the helmet should fit is important. Avery noted: "A number of 
times, I've seen people riding down the road with their helmet on backward." 
Others don't realize that the helmet should be worn level, on the top of the 
head close to the eyebrows, and not tilted toward the back of the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Choose the smallest helmet that fits. And don't buy it large for your child to 
grow into. Many come with adjustable padding on the inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should be a snug fit," said Mark Eaton, owner of Bill's Bike Shop in 
Camarillo. "It's most important to have the strap adjusted properly." 
</P>
<P>
 The more ventilation the helmet has, the cooler it will be. Avoid dark-colored 
helmets; instead choose ones that are more visible. Some helmets come with 
reflectors and even lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, keep this in mind: The helmet law also applies to children riding in a 
child carrier on the bicycle, as well as those riding in little trailers behind 
the bike. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, young bicyclists must wear a helmet that meets the standards of 
the American National Standards Institute or the independent Snell Foundation. 
In fact, all bicycle helmets sold in California must meet these standards and 
be so marked. Look for the stickers when you buy a helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 Helmets generally run from $20 to $120, with the higher-priced ones providing 
a better fit, better aerodynamics, more ventilation and a lighter feel, 
according to shop owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The law has built-in help for families that can't afford a helmet. It provides 
that 72.5% of the revenue from the fines to go to county health departments for 
bicycle safety education and to help low-income families obtain helmets. 
</P>
<P>
 However, even after Jan. 1, 1995, violators and their parents may not get 
stuck with fines. According to the law, charges will be dismissed if an 
admission is made under oath that the charge is the first violation by the 
child. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole idea behind the helmet law is to prevent serious head injuries, 
according to Assemblyman Louis Caldera (D-Los Angeles), author of the bill. 
Fewer than 6% of California's children wear helmets when bicycling, and almost 
18,000 California kids end up in emergency rooms with head injuries each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Bike shop owners say helmets are becoming more acceptable to kids, and they 
tend to think of them as less nerdy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's becoming cool now," Eaton said. "Attitudes are changing." Flashy helmets 
with snazzy markings on them help. 
</P>
<P>
 Local police who see helmet-less riders will probably issue a verbal warning 
during 1994. And some said there won't be the manpower or the time to track 
down a parent when an infraction occurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not practical to take every kid home who is not wearing a helmet," Simi 
Valley Police Sgt. Jeff Malgren said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first year of the new law will be "a free ride," he said. During that 
time, officers will probably spend some time explaining the law at school 
assemblies. 
</P>

COVER STORY: CLOSE ENCOUNTERS; UFO BELIEVERS -- AND ABDUCTEES -- SAY IT CAN 
HAPPEN HERE 
</P>

<P>
 The 75 folding chairs were lined up in the meeting room, cookies and punch 
ready in the back. The club newsletter was neatly laid out by the door. 
</P>
<P>
 But this was no garden club meeting. Soon, three men and a woman -- they 
looked like anyone you'd see at the shopping mall -- would tell the hushed room 
about their abduction by aliens and being taken aboard a spacecraft. 
</P>
<P>
 It's another local chapter meeting of the Mutual UFO Network Inc., better 
known as MUFON. Gathering each month at the Cameron Center in Thousand Oaks, 
the group is part of an international organization that takes the business of 
investigating the UFO phenomenon very seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 These are folks who want no part of the wackier fringe elements of UFOlogy, as 
they call it. Yet here they are, listening to a guy from Burbank talking about 
aliens implanting some little gizmo in his leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesse, as he was introduced, had undergone regressive hypnosis that had, with 
horrifying clarity, unearthed memories of multiple abductions. The little gray 
beings with big heads, he said, first snatched him when he was 5. Last year, 
there were nine abductions and several mornings when he awoke to find strange 
marks and wounds on his body. But most troubling was the forced cross-breeding 
with female aliens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can we please not talk about my children?" he choked in response to a 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it possible that little gray creatures are beaming their hapless victims up 
to their spaceship for bizarre medical procedures? 
</P>
<P>
 If common sense says no, a flurry of books published over the past few years 
suggests otherwise. More people are coming forward with stories of abductions, 
which, UFO believers claim, bear amazing similarities. 
</P>
<P>
 The UFO phenomenon is hotter than ever. The local chapter of MUFON, started 
just three years ago, has swelled to about 40 members, and its meetings 
sometimes draw double that. And it is not unusual to see earnest postings such 
as the recent newspaper ad from an Ojai man looking for others with whom he 
might share UFO experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 But all the hubbub over aliens and UFOs is taking a new twist. Some mental 
health professionals are now insisting that regressive hypnosis reveals 
fantasy, not fact. They say the abductions never happened, although the 
memories seem frighteningly real. 
</P>
<P>
 Believers, clearly, think otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who has researched it, anyone who has really done their homework -- I 
don't know how they could say it doesn't happen," said Alice Leavy of Newbury 
Park, assistant director of the local chapter. Beamed Up 
</P>
<P>
 Leavy, who owns a real estate appraisal business with her husband, believes 
that it happened a year ago in Camarillo. Since March, she and Mike Evans, 
director of the MUFON chapter, have been investigating the group's first big 
Ventura County case, and it's a doozy. 
</P>
<P>
 Two women turned to the group for help after months of anguish over a 
mysterious incident they say occurred on the Ventura Freeway on Nov. 20, 1992. 
(MUFON is keeping their identities confidential.) 
</P>
<P>
 According to MUFON's account, the women -- one in her 20s, the other in her 
30s -- were driving north on the freeway about 9:30 p.m. when a huge, bright 
light appeared above and ahead of them. It was racing downward toward the car. 
The women were terrified that it was an airplane about to crash into them. 
</P>
<P>
 The next thing they knew, they were exiting the freeway in Ventura. It was 
close to midnight, and they had no idea what had happened to the previous 2 1/2 
hours. Both women agonized for months over the missing time. 
</P>
<P>
 Then MUFON steered them to Yvonne Smith, a Los Angeles hypnotherapist who 
specializes in abduction cases. During hypnosis, they recounted a terrifying 
scene in which the light that blinded them was an oblong UFO the size of a 
football field. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Smith and MUFON representatives, the women told this tale: 
</P>
<P>
 They found themselves aboard a spacecraft. One was stripped and examined by 
little gray aliens with big heads and big eyes who communicated telepathically. 
She was peered at by another creature that resembled a praying mantis. 
</P>
<P>
 The other woman was guarded by one of the aliens. Before the episode ended, 
the aliens told the women that they would be back. 
</P>
<P>
 Did it really happen? Credible Sources? 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics say such abduction memories are the workings of an imagination 
heightened during hypnosis. Or they are subtly suggested by the hypnotherapist. 
Or they are hallucination-like nightmares and pieces of other memories. One 
critic claims that the so-called abductees are reliving the birth experience. 
Even MUFON members aren't unanimously supportive of the process of regressive 
hypnosis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hypnosis turns on people's imagination -- that's all it is," retired Kentucky 
psychologist Robert A. Baker scoffed. "It's very easy to do. I can teach anyone 
in five minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker serves on the Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of 
the Paranormal, a self-proclaimed skeptics organization, and contends that 
there are natural explanations for abduction memories, UFO sightings and 
missing time. 
</P>
<P>
 He claims that hypnotherapists are "scaring the hell out of people" by giving 
credence to the abduction scenario. 
</P>
<P>
 But Leavy and Evans, who were present when the two women involved in the 
Camarillo incident were hypnotized, contend that the experience was real -- and 
wrenching. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's terrible to go through the pain of regression," said Leavy, who found 
herself weeping while witnessing the women's agony. 
</P>
<P>
 "During hypnosis, they relive the experience -- their coloring goes white," 
said Smith, whose hypnotherapy practice includes 70 people who believe that 
they have had some sort of abduction experience. She even provides a support 
group for them. The most convincing fact, said Smith, who spoke recently to the 
Ventura County MUFON group, is that people all over the country who don't know 
one another are recalling remarkably similar incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Most are troubled by missing time, she said. Many are lifted to the spacecraft 
in a beam of light, usually from their bedrooms at night. The most commonly 
reported aliens -- referred to as the Grays -- are three to five feet tall with 
four digits, no hair, dark eyes and a small mouth that doesn't seem to work. 
However, some abductees have reported human-sized "Nordic" aliens with light 
features; yet others report insect-like creatures. Some wake up with 
unexplained body marks, and for some, the entire abduction horror goes on 
repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
 MUFON "broke new ground" during its investigation of the case involving the 
two women, according to Evans, a Simi Valley nurse. The group paid for the 
hypnosis sessions and X-rays of one woman's ear, which has been troubling her 
since the incident. The X-ray ruled out the possibility, he said, that aliens 
had implanted a device. 
</P>
<P>
 The story has more bizarre twists. The results of the hypnosis session suggest 
that the two women may have been abducted previously. And on the night of the 
incident, they were returning home from their first MUFON meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Could the meeting, in heightening their awareness of UFOs, have influenced the 
pair? Maybe. But MUFON member Lance Lorien, a computer programmer, was also 
traveling home from the meeting that night. 
</P>
<P>
 When he got home to Goleta, he told his wife that he had seen a strange white 
light in the sky between Camarillo and Ventura. "It was an odd light that 
frightened me," he said. "It went from right to left really fast." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until months later that he heard about the two women. He still has 
no idea what it was he saw or whether it was the same light they saw. Nor is he 
convinced that aliens are abducting people off the highway or from their 
bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans is more of a believer. As a nurse, he once worked in a Los Angeles 
psychiatric ward. Some patients, who claimed contact with aliens, were passed 
off as nut cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking back on it now, they may have had actual abductions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans, like Leavy, is a field investigator trainee for MUFON, which has 
extensive standards for certification. But calls about strange sightings in the 
Ventura County sky are not frequent. 
</P>
<P>
 What happens more often is that someone who has seen or experienced something 
bizarre will nervously approach Leavy or Evans during a meeting and take them 
aside. "They'll start by saying, 'I know I'm not crazy,' " Leavy said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's how the group received another abduction case to investigate recently. 
About a year ago, Leavy said, a Thousand Oaks man awoke to see an alien by his 
bed. He too was referred to Smith for hypnotherapy. It Can Happen to You 
</P>
<P>
 UFOlogy is gaining new respect, Evans and others say, as more people come 
forward to talk about sightings. Many of these events occurred years ago, when 
fear of ridicule made it risky to go public. 
</P>
<P>
 MUFON member David Gordon, a physician practicing in Woodland Hills, took it 
upon himself to find out how many people believe that they have seen UFOs and 
even aliens. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Gordon, a general practitioner, began a survey of his patients, 
many of them from Ventura County. What he found out surprised him. Out of 1,050 
patients surveyed, 115 (11%) said they had seen a UFO. Of those, 60 were able 
to sketch the thing on one of Gordon's prescription pads. Eight patients 
related abduction experiences. Four others reported seeing aliens. 
</P>
<P>
 They detailed incidents from around the world -- from Tehran to Death Valley 
-- with some occurring decades ago. But a number popped up in Ventura County, 
especially Simi Valley. For instance, there was the 61-year-old woman, driving 
home from work in 1976, who thought that she saw a huge UFO with yellow and red 
lights sitting on a vacant lot at a Simi Valley intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 "She told her husband, but she never told another living soul until I asked 
her about it," Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the maintenance worker who said he chased a cigar-shaped UFO for 10 
minutes after it flew over a Simi road. The restaurant owner who pulled off the 
Simi Valley Freeway to watch a disk-like object in the sky at dusk. The woman, 
driving the same freeway, who saw a silver UFO hovering over the road. The 
woman soaking in a hot tub who recalled three triangular-shaped craft that flew 
over the house without a sound. And the nurse, on her way to The Oaks mall, who 
swore that she saw a UFO hovering near the freeway exit. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon, a card-carrying field investigator for MUFON, feels one need only 
patiently "sky watch" and eventually a sighting will occur. With other UFO 
believers, he has gone on "stakeouts" to UFO hot spots north of Los Angeles and 
has seen puzzling objects in the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 His physician wife, Eva, an allergist, says she saw a UFO a year ago -- a 
silver disk, larger than a 747, over Topanga State Park. Now she too is 
surveying her patients about sightings. 
</P>
<P>
 UFO debunkers say sightings generally can be explained as airplanes, 
satellites, shooting stars, blimps, weather balloons and clouds. Even the 
planet Venus has fooled people. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Barr of Newbury Park admits that he was fooled once. Barr, an engineer 
who attends MUFON meetings, said he saw a strange object in the sky one night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made no sound. It was fast. It looked like a wobbling UFO," he said. He 
rushed to get his binoculars and, when he focused, he saw an owl perched 50 
feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 But Barr, like many MUFON members, has witnessed other, more puzzling sights 
over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Campbell's close encounter came 13 years ago, when he was startled to see 
a red light hanging over the night skies of Thousand Oaks. Then he saw what 
looked like military aircraft approaching the light before it made a 90-degree 
turn and disappeared in a red streak. It was as close as 500 feet above his 
house, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it was, I have no idea," said Campbell, a co-founder of the local MUFON 
chapter. Campbell works in vocational education and believes that 99% of the 
UFO sightings can be explained. "It's the 1% I'm interested in." 
</P>
<P>
 Mention the word government and Evans and others will rail that the United 
States knows a great deal more than it is telling. (The group's monthly 
newsletter, Swamp Gas, is a play on the government's early explanation of UFO 
sightings.) 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been one great big cover-up since 1947," Evans said, referring to the 
year a mysterious object -- thought to be a UFO by some -- crashed near 
Roswell, N. M. It's a Conspiracy 
</P>
<P>
 At meetings, MUFON members share theories and information about UFO 
developments, listen to speakers and sometimes watch films, such as a videotape 
recently taken from an airplane flying over isolated spots north of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission was to surveil buildings owned by major aerospace firms -- 
Northrop and Lockheed among them -- that some MUFON members believe may 
camouflage underground bases for UFO activities. It was a hunch that not 
everyone in the audience bought. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see any evidence of it being anything other than a research 
facility," one woman said after the film. "My response is, 'So what?' " 
</P>
<P>
 And it's certainly a hunch the firms quickly dismiss. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no UFO activity at Lockheed, I can tell you that," said Jim 
Ragsdale, spokesman for Lockheed Advanced Development Co., which operates a 
facility near Helendale north of San Bernardino that measures radar signals. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, a dozen MUFON members armed with cameras took an eight-hour field 
trip to the area one weekend, skirting the sites by car to look for suspicious 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Although members view the UFO enigma seriously and want to be taken seriously, 
the meetings are not without humor. After one meeting, Barr mused on the notion 
that aliens are abducting people. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jury is still out on regressive hypnosis," he said. "When it happens to 
me, you can take it to the bank."

UFO ABDUCTION -- A SURVIVOR'S GRIM RECOLLECTION; ONE MAN TESTIFIES TO AN EERIE, 
FRIGHTENING ENCOUNTER IN HIS YOUTH. 'I KNOW WHAT IT FEELS LIKE TO BE RAPED,' HE 
SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 He's 42, married with two kids, devoutly Christian and holds a responsible job 
in the medical profession. 
</P>
<P>
 And, he believes that he was once beamed up to a spaceship in a flash of blue 
light by little gray aliens with big heads. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows that sounds nutty. That's why he doesn't use his real name when he 
talks about it. He doesn't want any grief at work. Call him Bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to protect my kids," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Why him? He doesn't know, but his experience lends credence to the theory held 
by some UFO believers that aliens are abducting people to perform medical 
procedures on them. That is, if the abductions are real, and plenty of skeptics 
contend that they aren't. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill's story goes back to 1967, when he was camping with three teen-age 
friends in Los Padres National Forest north of Santa Barbara during Easter 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 They were bedded down in sleeping bags when Bill awoke near dawn only to find 
himself out of his sleeping bag and away from the campsite. His attention was 
instantly commanded by a bright light in the sky with orange and blue lights 
flickering at its edges. 
</P>
<P>
 He woke one of his friends. "I pinched him to make sure he was awake," he 
said. Together, they watched the strange object zoom back and forth across the 
sky before it was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys cut their camping trip short that morning and went home. "We decided 
not to talk about this again," he said. Over the years, he was troubled by 
weird dreams that left him sweaty, disoriented and scared. He began reading 
books about UFOs. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, he underwent regressive hypnosis with Los Angeles hypnotherapist 
Yvonne Smith, who specializes in abduction cases. The results were startling. 
</P>
<P>
 He remembered four aliens who beamed him aboard in a moment so terrifying that 
he couldn't move, and blacked out. He was taken into a chamber with a glass 
canopy that appeared to be an examining room. Some sort of instrument painfully 
probed his rectum and another collected semen from him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what it feels like for a woman to be raped," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as he knows, the abduction was a onetime thing. For that, he is glad. 
He would wish the experience on no one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not making money out of this," he said. Nor is it easy on his marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't talk to my wife about this. It drives her nuts." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill's story is similar to those of about 60 people interviewed for the 1992 
book "Secret Life -- Firsthand Documented Accounts of UFO Abductions," by UFO 
researcher David M. Jacobs. They underwent regressive hypnosis to recall the 
abductions. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs theorizes that aliens are abducting people and subjecting them to 
invasive medical procedures to learn about the human body, especially the 
reproductive system. They want sperm and eggs from humans for their own 
breeding program, he surmises, which could result in human-alien hybrid beings.

<P>
 Bill thinks that there might be something to the bizarre theory. His 
experience left him feeling like a rabbit in a research lab.

JAUNTS; PARKLAND SPRINGS BACK TO LIFE IN WAKE OF FALL'S BRUSH FIRES; VISITORS 
CAN HELP RANGERS RECORD RECOVERY GROWTH AT RANCHO SIERRA VISTA PARK, WHERE THE 
LANDSCAPE IS ALREADY TURNING GREEN. 
</P>

 After the Green Meadow fire tore through Rancho Sierra Vista Park in Newbury 
Park in the fall, the once-majestic grassy hills looked like a charred 
moonscape. 
</P>
<P>
 But new vegetation is springing up, and National Park Service rangers are 
curious about how long it will take the 838-acre park to fully recover from the 
fire. 
</P>
<P>
 To find out, they are cataloguing the new growth each month with photographs 
and plant measurements. Anyone who wants to participate in the cataloguing and 
find out more about fire ecology can join ranger Jaquie Stiver on a hike in the 
park Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stiver will meet hikers at 10 a.m. in the park's parking lot. From there, she 
will lead them to 18 spots at which she took measurements and photographs in 
November and December. 
</P>
<P>
 She said most people don't realize that burned parkland recovers as quickly as 
it does. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first week after the fire, it was completely devastated, and there was no 
hope," she said. But Rancho Sierra Vista is already showing much new growth, 
she said, citing wild cucumber and wild rye as making fast comebacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Stiver said the park service hopes to track the park's regrowth over the next 
five years, cataloguing the 18 spots each month during the first year, then two 
or three times a year after that. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the photographs and measurements, she plans to put together an exhibit 
to show park visitors, in month-by-month increments, just how fast the 
re-vegetation takes place. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday's hike, she will invite participants to help study several aspects 
of the wildlife in the park: the plants and their growth, birds and their 
behavior, and the size of animal tracks such as the coyote or bobcat. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will be helping us with a lot of our record-keeping," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The free hike will cover about 1.5 miles and run about two hours, with Stiver 
passing on information about the fire and recovery process. The park service 
will hold other, similar hikes throughout the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Sierra Vista abuts Point Mugu State Park, which runs all the way 
through Sycamore Canyon down to the Pacific Ocean. Historians believe that the 
area was once part of a Chumash trade route. 
</P>
<P>
 Satwiwa, which means bluffs, was the name of a Chumash village in the area. 
Because of this heritage, a portion of Rancho Sierra Vista has been designated 
as the Satwiwa Native American Indian Natural Area. Also located in the park is 
the Satwiwa Native American Indian Culture Center. Although the park was 
devastated by the fire, the center survived and is open Sundays to visitors.

SHOP TALK; BEST TO TAKE MATTRESS PURCHASES LYING DOWN; MANUFACTURERS SOMETIMES 
GIVE CONFUSING INFORMATION. SMART CONSUMERS WILL PUT PROSPECTIVE BUYS TO THE 
TEST.

 We may love to shop, and we may love to hunt for bargains. But shopping for a 
new mattress is never any fun. One key reason for this is that you never know 
whether you've found a real bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a look at why buying a mattress set is such a miserable experience -- 
and a list of tips on finding a bed you like without losing sleep over it. 
</P>
<P>
 Retailers call a mattress and box spring a "blind item." In other words, we 
can't see what we're buying. Here's why: 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers and retailers have made price comparison impossible by giving 
different names to nearly identical mattresses sold at different stores. A 
Simmons Beautyrest Horizon at the Broadway may be called a Simmons Beautyrest 
Ambassador at Bullocks -- and still another name at another outlet. The 
mattress will be identical in structure, but the ticking or upholstery will be 
a different color or pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 Making matters worse, the manufacturer's label, whether the model is low-end 
or high-priced, never answers questions about quality. 
</P>
<P>
 The temptation, then, is to turn to the warranty. And most mattresses have 
impressive warranties. But here again, quality is difficult to assess. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term warranties -- some are for 15 and 20 years -- often specifically 
limit liability to structural failure, like a popped spring or loosed stitching 
in the main case. All of which means that the valley you and your mate have put 
into the mattress through years of use may not be covered. The practical life 
of a mattress, industry experts agree, is really eight to 10 years' use. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the jargon. Ask for a "firm" mattress, and learn that all 
mattresses are called firm. Or super-firm, ultra-firm or ortho-firm. We didn't 
see a single mattress called "Soft" or "Super-Squishy." 
</P>
<P>
 The trend in mattresses now is for a "plush" bed surface, more padding for 
more comfort. Many of the most expensive mattresses were the "pillow-top" 
style. These thicker, plusher mattresses feel great but will probably require 
new bedding. Only sheets described as "deep-cut" or "high-contour" will fit 
these fat mattresses. 
</P>
<P>
 How, then, to find the right bed? 
</P>
<P>
 In the absence of comparable ratings and standards and meaningful warranties, 
the real guide is comfort and price. To shop well for a mattress, you must try 
it out!  
</P>
<P>
 Dress comfortably and be prepared to look like an idiot. The only way you're 
going to know if the bed is right for you is by laying down on it for a few 
minutes. Roll around. Bring your partner, because a bed that is comfortable for 
a 110-pound woman may not be comfortable for a 200-pound man or, for that 
matter, both of you at once. 
</P>
<P>
 A word about the box springs. They are comparable to the shock absorbers in 
your car. It is not recommended to put a new mattress on an old box spring. 
This will cause the mattress to wear out fast. Still, a new mismatched 
mattress/box spring set may be a way to get a good deal. Just be sure the 
mattress and box spring are mismatched only in cosmetics, that they appear to 
be of similar quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Now go for price. You've found the right mattress, with comfort as your guide. 
Old-fashioned bargaining is in order. Hesitate, and see if the sales person can 
lower the price. If the mattress isn't on sale now it most likely will be next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask if there are any close-outs or discontinued mattress sets. The bigger the 
store the better the chances are they will have some of these. Savings can be 
substantial. 
</P>
<P>
 And remember that a bed frame can usually be included, free of charge, with 
the purchase of a new mattress set. Make sure delivery, set-up of the new bed 
and the removal of your old mattress are included, too. Since so many things 
with mattresses are vague, most things involving mattresses are negotiable. 
</P>

MUSIC; BAD RELIGION, THE BAND WITH OWN LABEL, RIDES INTO TOWN; GROUP WILL PLAY 
AT RED DOG SALOON IN SANTA BARBARA. THEY HAVE BEEN RELEASING THEIR OWN RECORDS 
SINCE 1980. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The West will take a turn for the wild when Bad Religion takes the stage at 
the Red Dog Saloon in Santa Barbara Sunday night. The heels of any misinformed 
members of the pointy shoe crowd will be pointing toward the door quicker than 
Gary Cooper could mumble "nope" once the set begins, for it contains no slow 
ones and, least of all, no twang. The "wahoos" will turn to groans as finheads, 
skaters and punks, powered by the exuberance and chemistry of youth, dance like 
Lurch all over the place. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad Religion, unlike most bands that stress seriously trying to get signed, 
instead has been releasing its own records on its own label, Epitaph, since 
1980. The new one, "Recipe For Hate," is, in fact, the recipe for cash, as it 
was picked up by Atlantic Records. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to having big label support, the band also has friends. Johnette 
Napolitano of Concrete Blond and Eddie Vedder of Pearl Jam guest on the new 
album. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides a deal and fans, the band even has brains. Frontman Greg Gaffin is 
working toward his Ph.D. at Cornell. The other members not working for a 
doctorate include: Brett Gurewitz and Greg Hetson on guitars, Jay Bentley on 
bass and Bobby Schayer on drums. Bentley discussed the good, the bad and the 
loud during a recent phone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad Religion has played Santa Barbara before? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, we played the Anaconda Theater before. About 10 years ago we played at 
the Goleta Valley Community Center. That was the happening venue up there, 
which really put Santa Barbara on the map as far as hardcore shows go. That's 
how Golden Voice got started. I don't know if you know how big they are in 
L.A., but Golden Voice is up there with Avalon Attractions now, with about 50 
full-time employees and the rights to the Palladium. 
</P>
<P>
 Most bands spend an inordinate amount of time sniveling about how they can't 
get signed. But you guys started your own company, Epitaph. What's up with 
that? 
</P>
<P>
 In the '80s, no one wanted to deal with you if you were in a punk band. There 
were only a couple of labels: SST, Alternative Tentacles and Taang! We didn't 
want to be on a label outside of where we lived, so we pretty much just put out 
our own stuff, and Epitaph is just the name we chose. 
</P>
<P>
 Your singer is studying evolutionary biology at Cornell. Will we see a lot of 
evolutionary biology on the dance floor at the gig? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, there will be a lot of protoplasm in action there, and those cowboys are 
going to see some primordial ooze on the dance floor. Greg's studying for his 
Ph.D. and he fell behind in his research, so he dropped his student teaching 
for this year so he can spend more time in the boonies catching little fish. 
That's what he does. We'll probably still do 90 to 110 shows this year. We can 
pretty much play anywhere we want these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Will anyone be killed on the dance floor during your show? 
</P>
<P>
 When I play, I try to watch what's going on out there in the pit. If one guy 
is going off, or if three guys are beating up one guy, I'll stop the show and 
go out there and put a stop to it. 
</P>
<P>
 What became of all the bald people who dance like Lurch and who once went to 
your gigs? 
</P>
<P>
 Things have changed to the point where you don't have to be a punk rocker 
anymore to go to a punk rock show. We get punkers, but also skaters, surfers, 
bikers and college geeks. Now, it's a lot better for everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 One of your more notorious gigs was a riot at a Hollywood theater. What 
happened? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh geez. We were booked to play in a real movie theater with seats and an 
official capacity of 900. Well there were about 1,200 people in there when the 
fire marshal came and told everyone to take a seat before the show could go on. 
You can imagine what happened with 300 extra people with no seats. They started 
ripping the seats off the ground and winging them onto the stage. We knew it 
was going to be like that. 
</P>
<P>
 Any other strange ones? 
</P>
<P>
 On our last tour, we played a death metal festival in Finland. All of the 
people wore black and hadn't been in the sun for a long time. There was a 
British band sort of like the Dickies, us, and 10 death metal bands. When we 
played, everyone just sort of sat there and stared. We didn't look like the 
other bands, but we were loud. I think they booked us solely on our decibel 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 Has your music changed much over the years? 
</P>
<P>
 It hasn't changed much. We're expanding upon a three chord thing, which is up 
to, maybe, five or seven chords now. Some people complain that our stuff all 
sounds the same, and that one of our records was only 28 minutes long. What's 
wrong with that? I can't believe those bands that put out 70-minute CDs. I 
don't think anyone could stand to hear any band for 70 minutes. When we play 
live, we do a little over an hour, and I can see everyone is just worn out by 
the time we're done. I don't think they could take much more of us. 
</P>
<P>
 What appeal did Bad Religion have to Atlantic Records that you didn't have, 
say, five years ago? 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of it had to do with Danny Goldberg at Atlantic. He had an idea of what 
the underground bands were doing, plus a lot of people at Atlantic now weren't 
there five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you think Jim Bakker would wear a Bad Religion T-shirt in prison? 
</P>
<P>
 I think Jim Bakker should wear a Bad Religion shirt in prison. Maybe I'll send 
him a hat. When we first started, all these televangelists were making all 
kinds of money. People would cash their welfare checks or Social Security 
checks and send 80% of their money to Jerry Falwell, then live on cat food. It 
was people taking advantage of other people that were insecure. But we were 
only 15 at the time, and no one would listen to us. Maybe we just wanted to be 
sure that didn't happen to us. 
</P>
<P>
 Anything you haven't done yet? 
</P>
<P>
 I'd like to play with the Clash. I hear they're talking about a reunion tour. 
Then we're going to start work on our eighth album in April.

EARTHWATCH: SEPARATE, RECYCLE TRASH A GOOD RESOLUTION; SMART SHOPPING HELPS TO 
REDUCE THROW-AWAY PACKAGING AND WILL BEGIN 1994 ON AN ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY 
NOTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Let me share with you a recent cartoon printed in Garbage Reincarnation 
magazine. It shows Satan standing at the gates of hell, looking puzzled as a 
particularly anxious group of new recruits shuffles in. His demon assistant is 
whispering in his ear, "A new category . . . NOT separating their trash." 
</P>
<P>
 My message to those condemned, albeit too late, is "You shoulda been smarter 
shoppers so your trash would be real easy to separate." 
</P>
<P>
 We're still in the shadow of New Year's resolution-making. It's not too late. 
It takes a resolution of the New Year's kind to separate properly. 
</P>
<P>
 The other day I got a letter from an Oxnard resident, Louise Gerber, asking 
how I manage to recycle everything, as the blurb on this column asserts. Well, 
I don't really. What I do is avoid things, not bringing them home in the first 
place, lest they might end up in the trash. 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. Gerber, a serious recycler, asked about cereal boxes, which are 
specifically not supposed to be put in our recycling bins in this county. All I 
can say is to buy in bulk at a health food store, scooping the stuff into the 
plastic bag they provide and then take those bags to Von's or Ralph's recycling 
bin when you're through with them. Not very exciting, but little things 
eventually add up -- if you're really going to get into separating your trash 
and recycling matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. Gerber, whom I called to thank for her letter and ask for some suggestions 
of her own, said of her shopping routine: "I'm much more ready to buy if 
there's a 1 or a 2 imprinted on the container . . . so I can recycle." Why? 
Because in Ventura County, only those two types of plastic are supposed to go 
into the curbside recycling bin. The other-numbered empty containers are 
landfilled. Thus, Ms. Gerber has turned herself into a not-very-frequent 
customer of products packed in plastics with big numbers on them. 
</P>
<P>
 I checked further with David Goldstein, a recycling expert with Ventura 
County. He said the garbage pick-up policy in parts of the east county allows 
plastic with the number 6 on it to be put in recycling bins. He advises calling 
your local city hall for specifics. So, if you're in Simi Valley, for instance, 
you can put Styrofoam cups -- rinsed out, please -- in the recycling bin. 
</P>
<P>
 To put Ms. Gerber's and Mr. Goldstein's thoughts into the form of a 
resolution, I suggest that we conjure up in our minds one of those Ventura 
County freeway signs announcing "Route 126." Get it? 
</P>
<P>
 Ms. Gerber had another resolution to suggest. Write in and get yourself purged 
from the mailing lists of the junk mail companies who have been making money 
buying and selling your name and address. I looked into that, too, and came up 
with a place to write and make that demand. 
</P>
<P>
 And Mr. Goldstein had a resolution to suggest, too. It seems that people in 
Southern California, including those in Ventura County, have decided not to put 
tin cans in the recycling bin when separating garbage. Well, we should be 
recycling these cans, which are actually steel with a thin tin coating. 
</P>
<P>
 They are much in demand by industry as raw material for melting down and 
re-fabrication. Sort of like World War II, but this time around it's because 
recycling employs far less expensive energy than grinding and smelting raw iron 
ore. 
</P>
<P>
 This week the county began a publicity campaign, paid for by the Steel 
Recycling Institute, to get us to separate out all our cans, steel and aluminum 
from the garbage. I am, however, at a loss for a way to make this into a 
resolution that's easy to remember -- like the Route 126 concept. Maybe 
something about steel protecting us from eternal fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Nah. A belated happy new year, anyway. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: For the latest details on what's OK to put into your recycling bin for 
1994, call your local city hall or 648-9242, the Ventura County's Sold Waste 
Management District. To prevent junk mail from coming to your house and ending 
up in our local landfill, write and ask to have your name dropped from the 
major mass mailing lists. Attention: the Mail Preference Service, Direct 
Marketing Assn., P.O. Box 9008, Farmingdale, N.Y. 11735-9008. It works, though 
you may have to write more than once. And for a copy of the Shopper's 
Possessive Guide to Leaving Less Behind for the Future, call the California 
Integrated Waste Management Board at 1-800-CA-WASTE.

RESTAURANT REVIEW; PLAIN FARE MEANS MORE AT MARIANN'S; PORTIONS ARE LARGE, 
PRICES MODEST AND DINING DEPENDABLE -- IF YOU KNOW WHAT TO ORDER AT THE NEW 
ITALIAN VILLA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mariann's Italian Villa opened recently on Main Street, Ventura, to much 
anticipation. Mariann's enjoys a loyal following in two other outlets, in Santa 
Maria and Santa Barbara, and it was reasonable to expect a cloning of the 
chain's trusty formula: large portions of good Italian food at modest prices. 
</P>
<P>
 But the results are mixed in this newest venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Surely, the crowds have come. On midweek nights, diners sometimes fill three 
of the restaurant's four dining rooms, one so cozy as to have a fireplace but 
yet another whose bare-bulb overhead lights provide all the ambience of dining 
in a cavernous garage. 
</P>
<P>
 You will feel welcomed. The staff is warm and solicitous, owing, no doubt, to 
the influence of Mariann Anderson herself, whose presence is felt and whose 
husband, Ralph, is chefly architect of the menu. (Indeed, it is impossible to 
dine here without learning, either through Frank Sinatra's picture on the wall 
or in promotional literature at the door, that Ralph Anderson has cooked for 
some very famous people, claims that are my favorite among dubious culinary 
accolades.) 
</P>
<P>
 The food reveals all, of course, and at Mariann's it follows a clear divide 
between the genuinely satisfying and the simply disastrous. The more rustic and 
often-ordered selections are most successful; the fancier, more continental 
preparations fail. 
</P>
<P>
 Salads illustrate the point. Every dinner comes with a generous, perfectly 
fresh, mixed greens-with-grated-carrot house salad with a refreshingly tart 
Italian dressing. 
</P>
<P>
 But spend the extra $4.25 for a Caesar salad, and witness a bizarre display: A 
waiter arrives to prepare it table side. Instead of rubbing garlic into the 
sides of the bowl before tossing and instead of mixing an authentic dressing -- 
why else all the show? -- he simply reaches for a gravy boat loaded with 
viscous already prepared dressing. He dumps it, rolls the romaine around in it, 
fills a plate, and places it before you. He's gone before you can ask for 
fresh-ground pepper. He's gone the moment you realize that such a display of 
empty ostentation in Frank Sinatra's hometown of Hoboken, N.J., would incite a 
dining room riot. 
</P>
<P>
 The divide is repeated in appetizers. If it's a cold night, pass on the fine 
house salad and opt instead for the soup that accompanies every entree: 
minestrone. It is thick, fresh, filled with al dente vegetables and even a few 
rotelle . It is delicious. But get fancy and order the Sicilian antipasto 
($10.95) and face an uninspired plate heaped with cubed and sliced provolone 
(domestic), bland sliced pepperoni (domestic) and salami (domestic), pickled 
hot peppers topped with crushed garlic from a jar, green onions, and spiced 
ham. Antipasto was never intended to be plain old American deli. It's a drag. 
</P>
<P>
 Some entrees are, in fact, standouts. Chicken breast picatta ($9.95), while an 
inauthentic picatta , is a pleasingly rustic version in which perfectly grilled 
meat is heaped with sauteed fresh mushrooms, capers, lemon, and butter. 
</P>
<P>
 And Jerry Torri's homemade sausage ($11.95) is a home-run hit, even by Hoboken 
standards: homemade sausages, dense in the freshly seasoned meats and 
miraculously grease-free, are pan-seared and served with bell peppers and 
onions and a side of mostaccioli . 
</P>
<P>
 Things get riskier with seafood. Spicy shrimp marinara ($14.95), in which the 
butterflied crustaceans surround firm fettucini noodles for one of the more 
dazzling presentations around, simply lacked flavor and certainly heat. And 
orange roughy ($10.95) arrived encased in a sweater of batter, a failed attempt 
at giving the delicate white fish a bistro-stylish Francese treatment. The fish 
within, however masked, was fresh and succulent; the steamed carrots and 
broccoli surrounding it perfectly done. 
</P>
<P>
 As if to re-establish the kitchen's capacity to fail completely, a New York 
steak ($14.95) was beautiful in appearance, dead-on medium rare (as ordered) 
but dreadfully mealy in texture and wanting for any flavor whatsoever. The 
hungry steak lover who ordered it proclaimed disaster, took it home to the 
pets. Similarly, veal Marsala ($14.95), a Continental classic if there ever was 
one, bore gray-brown meat that was tough and metallic in flavor -- drawbacks 
that found no cover or redemption from an oily, too-sweet wine sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Desserts are humdrum. Cheesecake, instead of being ricotta-light or New 
York-dense, tasted like a bar of Philadelphia cream cheese. Cannolis were 
advertised in all four visits but never available. Ice creams and coffee were, 
however, just fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Mariann's wine list is extremely low-priced and selected well for the food. An 
even better buy, however, is the house Chianti, a light but trustworthy 
bottling, at $1.95 a glass and perfect, say, with the homemade sausages. 
</P>
<P>
 Go hungry, stick to the basics, and you'll do fine. Stray in a flicker of 
ambition, and you're on your own. Details

AT THE MARKET: EXOTIC SUBTROPICAL FRUIT IS WORTH ITS PRICE IN FLAVOR; AT ABOUT 
$7 A POUND, THE CHERIMOYA DRAWS FEW FANS. BUT THE BLEND OF FRESH FLAVORS IT 
OFFERS IS POPULAR WITH THOSE WHO KNOW WHAT IT IS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With a price tag that hovers around $7 a pound, the dear cherimoya may never 
earn "major mover" status for produce merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its cost, however, this South American highlands native continues to 
slowly attract retail buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, it's all in the flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are considered an exotic, but the real fact is that they are one of the 
most exquisitely delicious fruits in the world," Camarillo grower John Wooten 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not given to a wide range of culinary versatility, this juicy fruit is meant 
to be eaten fresh. The tender, cream-colored flesh of the near heart-shaped 
cherimoya imparts an exotic blend of vanilla custard, papaya, pineapple and 
banana flavors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a complete dessert," said Wooten, who sells the fruit from his 12 trees 
at Ventura's Saturday farmers market. "It doesn't need to be served with 
anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 It is best when served chilled; simply halve the fruit lengthwise and scoop 
the low-acid flesh with a spoon. The many plump, watermelon-like seeds you will 
encounter are not edible but easily removed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are really popular for the people who know what they are," said Karen 
Wetzel, manager of the Ventura County Farmers' Markets. "But it's still an 
unknown." 
</P>
<P>
 You can't miss this weighty, subtropical fruit on the produce shelf, however. 
Its yellowish, pale-green skin is distinguished by a uniquely faceted, 
scale-like appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering that a single cherimoya generally weighs anywhere from one-half to 
three pounds or more -- and cost $3 to $7 per pound -- the fruit may be 
destined to remain a specialty no matter how unique its taste. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for inflated prices: Cherimoya production is extremely 
labor-intensive from start to finish. 
</P>
<P>
 An arduous and time-consuming process of hand-pollinating the blossoms is 
required to ensure an abundant crop. And although the fruit is handpicked while 
still very firm, it must be handled cautiously all the way from the field to 
the marketplace to prevent bruising. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, growers' efforts are reaping rewards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are seeing a lot of (sales) growth outside California and very strong 
demand in Canada and Japan," said Peter Nichols, proprietor of California 
Tropics in Carpinteria, one of the industry's largest growers and packers. 
(California sales, Nichols said, have remained stagnant, though constant.) 
</P>
<P>
 A large percentage of thS. cherimoya production is grown in the moderate 
Southern California coastal region. This includes about 20 Ventura County 
growers tending to a small amount of acreage along the coastal belt and larger 
producers in the Carpinteria and Santa Barbara areas. Foreign competition comes 
mainly from Spain and South America. 
</P>
<P>
 Enthusiasts can expect relief soon from current premium prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles-based Fresh Produce Council, an industry trade group, reports 
that California growers are gearing up for what may be one of their largest 
crops ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "Depending on the retailer, you'll see prices come down into the $4.99- to 
$3.99-per-pound range," Nichols said. 
</P>
<P>
 When purchasing cherimoyas: Select firm fruit of any size, and avoid those 
that are overly soft and have dark brown surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
 The fruit should be left to ripen at room temperature much like an avocado. 
Cherimoyas will not ripen in the refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
 Ripeness is determined when the skin pales, turns brownish and yields to 
gentle palm pressure. Be careful while testing; the fruit bruises easily. 
</P>
<P>
 If upon slicing you discover that the fruit is rubbery and not yielding to 
gentle pressure, Nichols said it can be left to ripen for another day or two. 
</P>
<P>
 Once ripe, your fruit can be refrigerated about four days, but don't allow it 
to become squishy.

 RECIPE 
</P>
<P>
 The following recipe was provided by California Tropics: 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest Cherimoya-Chicken Salad 
</P>
<P>
 4 to 5 cups shredded lettuce leaves 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups julienne strips of cooked chicken breast 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups cherimoya chunks, peeled and seeded (about 1 1/2 pounds) 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup julienne strips red, yellow or green pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup red onion strips 
</P>
<P>
 Dressing: 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup orange juice 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup light olive oil or vegetable oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 fresh or dried chili, seeded and minced (jalapeno, Serrano or small Anaheim) 
</P>
<P>
 1 tablespoon, chopped cilantro 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon honey 
</P>
<P>
 dash of salt 
</P>
<P>
 In a large bowl, combine lettuce, chicken, cherimoya, pepper and onion. In a 
food processor or blender, place juice, oil, chili, cilantro, honey and salt. 
Cover and process until mixture is smooth and well blended. Toss salad with 
dressing; garnish with fresh cilantro sprigs. Makes three to four main dish 
salads. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: The local cherimoya harvest generally begins in November and continues 
into May. The fruit is available at upscale grocery stores, gourmet markets and 
area farmers markets. 
</P>
<P>
 * TIPS: Best when eaten fresh when chilled, simply halve lengthwise and scoop 
flesh with a spoon. The fruit can also be peeled and quartered for salads and 
compotes. Try in sorbets, or blend into tropical drinks.

BURBANK REJECTS CHURCH PLEA FOR SANCTUARY ENTOMBMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOCELYN Y. STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The archbishop of the Syrian Orthodox Church knows exactly where he wants his 
body to be laid to rest when he dies: in a vault nestled discreetly behind the 
altar of a church in Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 For 2,000 years, esteemed leaders have been honored with this type of 
entombment, say church leaders and members of the Burbank church who want to 
continue the practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's in the heart of our tradition and religious belief that an archbishop 
should be entombed in the sanctuary," said Pastor Joseph Tarzi of St. Ephraim 
Syrian Orthodox Church. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Burbank, that tradition may have died this week, when the City Council 
rejected a zone text amendment that would have allowed burials inside or 
underneath church property through a conditional-use permit. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 4-1 vote Tuesday night, the council let stand the current code that 
restricts burials to one cemetery zone in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the council and some residents expressed concern that allowing the 
entombment, even through the conditional-use process, would set a precedent 
that would make it difficult for the council to reject similar requests from 
individuals who might misuse the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you're opening a real Pandora's box by getting involved in this 
issue," said resident Ted McConkey, echoing a sentiment expressed by many. 
</P>
<P>
 But while church burials are rare in America, members of the Orthodox church 
say they are common in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "It falls more under the aegis of custom within a particular tradition," said 
Father Catalin D. Mitescu, a faculty member at Pomona College and president of 
the Orthodox Clergy Council of Southern California. "Some churches have that as 
a practice in the old countries, generally for people relatively important from 
the church's point of view." 
</P>
<P>
 At St. Sophia Greek Orthodox Cathedral at Normandie and Pico in Los Angeles, 
two church members are entombed in a mausoleum next to the church, said Father 
Andrew Barkos. 
</P>
<P>
 The church is located in an area that was zoned for burials, Barkos said. 
"We're next to a cemetery." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Los Angeles zoning officials could not recall an instance where a 
church entombment had taken place, such burials are possible in the city under 
existing legislation, said Robert Janovici, chief zoning administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 A church could be granted permission through a conditional-use permit or "by 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 "If it was normally an accessory function of the church to do that kind of 
thing, we would recognize the right for them to continue to do it," Janovici 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some members of St. Ephraim were disappointed with the Burbank 
council and the community's reaction to their request, Tarzi said the council 
"has a right to make that decision." 
</P>
<P>
 "If that's their decision, we respect it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And the council's decision was not wholly unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 Started in 1963 by immigrants from the Middle East, St. Ephraim is now the 
largest Syrian Orthodox congregation in the United States and Canada, Tarzi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first church building was located in Los Angeles, then in Hollywood. It 
moved to Burbank 4 1/2 years ago. The 800 families registered at the church are 
scattered throughout Los Angeles County, with concentrations in Burbank and 
North Hollywood, Tarzi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the church has had its fair share of bumpy rides with planning 
boards and communities. Tarzi speculated that part of the problem might rest 
with the public's unfamiliarity with the church. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't do any activities that are different, but because people are not 
familiar with the name, they may think we are different," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The church has a Sunday school, a worship choir and youth activities like many 
other churches. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost identical to a Protestant, Baptist or Methodist church or any 
other American church. We're Christians," Tarzi said. "A Christian church is a 
Christian church."

PARKS AGENCY GETS 60-ACRE GIFT FROM A 'SECRET DONOR'; SANTA MONICAS: THE 
MYSTERY BENEFACTOR IS BELIEVED TO BE FILM STAR JACK NICHOLSON. THE UNDEVELOPED 
LAND IS IN THE HILLS ABOVE STUDIO CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy has received a gift of 60 acres of 
parkland in the hills above Studio City from a donor who agency officials 
refused to name, but who sources familiar with the transaction said was film 
star Jack Nicholson. 
</P>
<P>
 In an announcement late Wednesday, conservancy officials said an "anonymous 
donor" had made a gift of the land -- which they described as "the most 
significant stretch of undeveloped ridgeline" between Mulholland Drive and 
Ventura Boulevard east of the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholson's business manager declined comment when asked the source of the 
gift. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I can say is it was an anonymous donation by a generous benefactor," 
conservancy Executive Director Joseph T. Edmiston said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Turnley Walker, chairman of the Longridge/Alomar Neighborhood Committee, 
which is active in preservation efforts in the area, said the mystery donor was 
Nicholson, as did a second source familiar with the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the parcel, which includes frontage on the north side of 
Mulholland Drive and the west side of Coldwater Canyon Boulevard, features an 
extensive native oak woodland and is habitat for deer. 
</P>
<P>
 It borders other tracts the conservancy has purchased or is trying to acquire 
in a continuing effort to preserve a continuous swath of wild-land habitat 
linking Griffith Park on the east to Topanga State Park on the west. 
</P>
<P>
 John A. Diaz, land acquisition chief for the conservancy, said a four-lot 
subdivision had been approved for the property, but that it "will now be 
available for all of the public to enjoy for all time." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an extremely important piece of open space on Mulholland that the 
conservancy and all persons interested in preserving the still-remaining 
magnificent vistas from Mulholland have long sought," said Jerome C. Daniel, 
chairman of the conservancy's policy-making board. 
</P>
<P>
 In refusing to name the benefactor, conservancy officials released an attorney 
general's opinion stating that they could treat the identity as "official 
information . . . acquired in confidence by a public employee." 
</P>
<P>
 "However, we note that the privilege is not absolute and a court may well 
conclude that disclosure of such information is in the best interests of the 
public," the opinion said. 
</P>
<P>
 Word of Nicholson's involvement will only enhance the conservancy's budding 
reputation as park agency to the stars. A state parks agency that acquires land 
in the Santa Monicas and neighboring ranges, including the Simi Hills and Santa 
Susana Mountains, the conservancy announced in November that entertainer Barbra 
Streisand was giving the agency her Malibu estate for use as an environmental 
research center. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, actors Warren Beatty and Peter Strauss and singer-songwriter Don 
Henley, formerly of the Eagles, had aided conservancy acquisition projects. The 
agency last month even got a film star on its board, when Los Angeles Mayor 
Richard Riordan named Ed Begley Jr. to represent the city on the eight-member 
panel.

</P>
<P>
 Kristin and 15 other Ventura County teen-agers got more than they bargained 
for last week at an all-day "ropes course" organized by a group called 
Adventures in Building for Life's Experiences (ABLE), a nonprofit Thousand Oaks 
organization aimed at helping troubled youths turn their lives around. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Kristin was back on course -- secured by a harness connected to a rope 
and pulley operated by instructors -- she paused on the wire and summed up one 
point of the exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, even if I fall now, it's OK because I got up here, right?" the helmeted 
teen-ager said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kristin did not fall. Instead, after walking a few dozen feet on the wire, 
turning and coming halfway back, she leaped off and allowed the instructor 
holding the rope to guide her gently to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I could take the world on now," Kristin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The exercise, conducted by instructors from the Wilderness Institute at a camp 
in the Santa Monica Mountains, is meant to teach the teen-agers teamwork and 
instill a sense of self-confidence, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, these kids have obstacles in their lives that they have no control 
over," said Bradley V. Childs, president of the Agoura Hills-based Wilderness 
Institute. "Out here, they have control and they have success, and it's very 
tangible." 
</P>
<P>
 Before climbing up to walk the wires all afternoon, participants in the ropes 
course spent the morning doing exercises meant to familiarize them with each 
other and build trust. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the ice was broken, the teen-agers were ready to help each other by 
holding the ladder steady and catching each other after a jump. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon Solis of Thousand Oaks said that in the woodsy setting of Camp Gilmore 
outside Agoura Hills, the experience of relying on the help of others to 
succeed was like nothing she had ever done before. 
</P>
<P>
 "I needed to get out of my neighborhood and do something different, where I 
had to trust people and trust myself doing things," the 17-year-old said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the teen-agers, who were referred to the program by teachers, youth 
outreach workers and probation officers, have been arrested for minor offenses 
or have had problems with grades or school attendance, said Shoshana Brower, 
ABLE's chairwoman. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization sponsors periodic outings to introduce the young people to 
new settings and skills, Brower said. For example, a recent trip to Anacapa 
Island featured kayaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all learn a better understanding of ourselves in the process," Brower 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brower and other volunteers who keep the organization going through 
fund-raising and trip planning are trying to expand the program to include 
monthly expeditions involving a greater number of youngsters, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marco Cordon, 17, said he was in a gang until he got involved with ABLE this 
year. Through the organization's activities, Marco said, he has become friends 
with former rival gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 The experiences in ABLE force participants to cooperate because "it takes 
teamwork," he said. "You have to trust other people. You have to rely on them." 
</P>
<P>
 Now he tries to recruit other gang members for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next, they're doing rock climbing," he said. "That's what I want to do."

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: INSPIRED BY DR. KING, HE PENS A WINNER

<TEXT>
<P>
 English and history were never Vinh Phan's favorite subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 So when his English teacher asked the class to write an essay on Dr. Martin 
Luther King Jr. for a contest, Vinh didn't think much about it at first. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was just an assignment," said the 16-year-old, a junior at 
Kennedy High School in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 But after reading about the famous civil rights leader in the library, Vinh 
said he began to get very inspired. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had never really thought about him," Vinh said. "But I learned that he 
worked for something and died for something, and we have to carry on his 
legacy." 
</P>
<P>
 Vinh's essay, which took about a week to research and write, won first place 
for 11th-graders in an annual essay and art contest sponsored by the Southern 
Christian Leadership Conference of Greater Los Angeles as part of its annual 
King Week Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 King "wanted us to 'rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to 
the sunlit path of racial justice,' " Vinh wrote, quoting King.  
</P>
<P>
 "In reaching this path," the student wrote, "King did not want us to push and 
shove to see who would get there first, but he wanted us to walk side by side 
to get there together." 
</P>
<P>
 For 17 years, the Southern Christian Leadership Conference has invited 
students from schools across the Southland to submit art and essays celebrating 
King's life and philosophy. One student winner and one honorable mention are 
selected from every grade level in third through 12th grade. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, more than 750 students entered the contest. The only two San 
Fernando Valley winners were Vinh and 11-year-old Hannah Whang, a student at 
Welby Way Elementary School in West Hills, who received honorable mention for 
her essay in the sixth-grade category. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme for the contest was: "The Legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.: Who 
Are Its Caretakers?" 
</P>
<P>
 Vinh, who was born in South Vietnam and escaped with his parents to the United 
States when he was about 1 1/2, said he believes everybody has a role to play 
in realizing King's dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all in too much of a hurry," he said. "If we all slowed down, we would 
get something done." SUSAN BYRNES

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: TOPANGA; DOCENTS SEEK FUNDS FOR NATURE CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When wildfires raged through the nature center on the old Stunt Ranch site, 
members of the Mountains Restoration Trust were focused on what they could 
save. 
</P>
<P>
 Now though, with the fires behind them, they are turning their attention to 
what was lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Helsley, president of the Cold Creek docents -- volunteers who ran the 
Katharine Spensly Nature Education Center -- said the program has always run on 
a shoestring budget that barely covers operational expenses. Now it's faced 
with the burden of replacing the nature center building and much of its 
contents. 
</P>
<P>
 Helsley said the trust has not yet calculated the dollar loss from the fire, 
but she said they are hoping to build a new structure with indoor toilets on 
the property. 
</P>
<P>
 In early November, when the flames decimated the site, the docents evacuated 
schoolchildren and loaded their cars with microscopes, insect collections, 
stuffed animals and murals. 
</P>
<P>
 But they couldn't prevent the charring of the renovated barn that served as 
the center, nor of the furniture, life-size statues, books and display cases it 
contained. Even the portable toilet on the site was destroyed.  
</P>
<P>
 The center was not insured, said Mountains Restoration Trust program director 
Jo Kitz. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitz said the trust, a nonprofit organization funded entirely through 
donations and grants, is exploring several options for replacing the losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitz said the donation requests were sent out this week. It's too early to 
know how much the trust can raise through donations, she said. JILL LEOVY

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; CITY PUSHES SPECIAL FREEWAY ADS BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite squabbles with some business owners over the issue, Agoura Hills 
officials have decided to push ahead with proposed state legislation that would 
allow fast-food, gas and other travel-related merchants within the city to 
advertise on special freeway signs. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, which the Assembly approved over the summer, would permit freeway 
signs bearing commercial logos in Agoura Hills on a trial basis, as an 
alternative to advertisements atop towering poles near the Ventura Freeway. Use 
of the signs would be reviewed by the Legislature after five years. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, Agoura Hills voters overwhelmingly upheld a city ordinance 
banning pole-top advertisements, despite a well-funded campaign against the law 
by business owners, some of whom lobbied against the state freeway sign bill. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilwoman Fran Pavley said the council will pursue the state bill 
despite the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to help our businesses attract people driving on the freeway," Pavley 
said. "But the voters have said loud and clear that they want the pole signs to 
come down. And many people feel the logo signs are a superior advertising form 
to the pole signs." 
</P>
<P>
 Rand Martin, a senior consultant for the bill's author, Assemblyman Terry B. 
Friedman (D-Brentwood), said he expects smooth sailing for the measure once the 
Senate Transportation Committee begins discussing it. That could happen as 
early as February, after which the bill would be considered by the 
Appropriations Committee and the full Senate, Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the votes for the bill," Martin said, "and we aren't worried about it 
moving along." 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the Legislature and signed by the governor, the bill would 
permit the only such freeway signs in a non-rural area of California, Martin 
said. Similar signs are used in rural parts of the state, as well as in 40 
other states, he said. KURT PITZER

FIRE OFFICIALS DEFEND HAVING FIRM HANDLE NON-EMERGENCY CALLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO and TERESA ANN WILLIS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fire officials involved in a pilot program in the San Fernando Valley in which 
private firms were used to handle non-emergency paramedic calls defended the 
program Wednesday, saying it freed firefighters to concentrate on more serious, 
life-threatening calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it was a good deal," said Capt. Alfred Stearns of the Canoga Park 
fire station, where the pilot program ran for nine months in 1991. "If we were 
tied up with another call, we could call the next closest private ambulance. 
But now we have to call the closest (city) paramedics." 
</P>
<P>
 Stearns joined a growing number of city officials supporting a plan to turn 
over non-emergency calls to private companies. Los Angeles City Fire Chief 
Donald O. Manning proposed such a plan Tuesday, acting on a directive from 
Mayor Richard Riordan to cut costs and privatize some services. 
</P>
<P>
 Battalion Chief Roger Gillis said the city could save close to $6 million by 
contracting out some services, but he cautioned that many issues have not been 
addressed, including response times and the quality of service to low-income 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 A final report on the plan said the program would reduce the Fire Department's 
workload and save money, but Gillis said "there needs to be further research 
done. It is a workable program, but not citywide." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1991 pilot program was conducted at 37 fire stations in the Valley, chosen 
because of its diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Valley has a little bit of everything," Gillis said. "It would give us a 
fairly general overview of the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the program, fire paramedics were the first to respond to a call. If 
they determined it was not an emergency, they asked a dispatcher to send for a 
private ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
 In Canoga Park, Stearns said, it gets so busy sometimes that fire paramedics 
have to be brought in from as far as Van Nuys to handle local calls. The pilot 
program allowed them to call the closest private ambulance.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: REDUCTION IN HOURS PROPOSED FOR 2 PARKS

<P>
 In response to late-night drinking, loitering and other problems at O'Melveny 
and Little Bee Canyon parks, Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson suggested 
Wednesday that the parks only open between sunrise and sunset. 
</P>
<P>
 The adjacent parks, which combined provide more than 700 acres of open space 
and represent the second largest city park, are now open between 5 a.m. and 
10:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bernson said the Granada Hills parks have recently suffered problems with 
car racing, drinking, loitering, graffiti and people firing guns in parking 
lots and other areas around the park, particularly on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Greig Smith, a Bernson aide, said the councilman had a public meeting near the 
parks in December and discussed the problems with nearby residents, park staff 
and police. He said support for the new hours was unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said the new hours must be approved by the city's Board of Recreation 
and Parks Commissioners before the proposal returns to the City Council for 
final consideration. But he said he expects the new hours to be approved and in 
effect by April or May. HUGO MARTIN

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: ASSESSMENT DISTRICT STUDIED FOR BOULEVARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT GLOVER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal to change the way property owners are asked to pay for a planned 
overhaul of Ventura Boulevard is a "very viable" way to go, a consultant who 
has worked on similar projects told a Los Angeles city-appointed panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Strong, a consultant to the development of Old Town Pasadena, said 
establishing a so-called assessment district -- in which property owners pay a 
predetermined amount over a period of years -- could work as a substitute to 
controversial fees based on the amount of traffic that a business generates. 
</P>
<P>
 Strong on Tuesday addressed the 13-member oversight panel that is studying 
funding alternatives to so-called "trip fees," which have been imposed on new 
developments on Ventura Boulevard since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Under trip fees, property owners are charged based on the amount of rush-hour 
traffic their businesses are expected to generate. But the fees have come under 
attack in recent months for placing an unfair burden on newcomers and 
discouraging development on the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 However, city Planning Associate Tom Rath said city planners would likely 
recommend that trip fees be retained, but that they also be reduced -- but to 
no less than $1,150. The fees are assessed according to a complicated formula 
that has left one large property with a bill of $800,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Panel chairman Jeff Brain favors halving the plan's $222-million budget and 
forming an assessment district to pay for roughly $50 million in improvements. 
The rest would be paid by vastly reduced trip fees. He said if trip fees remain 
too high, property owners -- who must approve establishment of an assessment 
district -- might be hesitant to support one. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, such districts are set up so that the cost of a project is spread 
fairly evenly among property owners over several years. Trip fees, on the other 
hand, are assessed just once. SCOTT GLOVER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: FIRE WARNINGS URGED FOR CHRISTMAS TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to several house fires sparked by Christmas trees, Los Angeles City 
Councilman Richard Alarcon has recommended that all Christmas tree vendors in 
the city be required to warn buyers about the fire dangers of the trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon made his recommendation Tuesday to the city's Board of Fire 
Commissioners and introduced the idea in the form of a motion to the City 
Council, which is likely to act on the recommendation by next week. 
</P>
<P>
 He also recommended that the fire warning be provided in English and Spanish 
and that the city consider launching a campaign to educate residents about the 
dangers of Christmas tree fires. 
</P>
<P>
 An Alarcon spokeswoman said the councilman's suggestion was made partly in 
response to a house fire in Sylmar that was ignited when a small boy put a lit 
candle too close to a Christmas tree. 
</P>
<P>
 A 3-year-old boy who was found in the burning house, unconscious and not 
breathing, died Monday at Northridge Hospital Medical Center. The boy's mother 
and brother also suffered burns and other injuries in the fire. HUGO MARTIN

COURTHOUSE CONSTRUCTION PLAN CALLED UNAFFORDABLE; FINANCES: SIX PROJECTS, 
INCLUDING ONE IN TORRANCE, SHOULD BE SCUTTLED, COUNTY OFFICIALS SAY. A 
POTENTIAL DEFICIT OF $312 MILLION OVER NINE YEARS IS FORECAST OTHERWISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Faced with a shortage of money for new courthouse construction, Los Angeles 
County officials are recommending that six projects, including one in Torrance, 
that have already cost millions of dollars be indefinitely postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 16-page report, Los Angeles County Chief Administrative Officer Sally R. 
Reed recommends that the Board of Supervisors shelve the construction of 
courthouses in Lancaster, Pasadena, West Los Angeles, South Bay, Santa Monica 
and North Hollywood. They have already cost the county $16 million in land 
acquisition, design and other costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other proposed projects in Southeast Los Angeles and Long Beach that have 
not cost the county anything yet should also be delayed indefinitely, the 
report states. 
</P>
<P>
 The only projects Reed recommends go forward are those in Chatsworth and near 
Los Angeles Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 As a stopgap measure, Reed recommends that the county lease space for traffic 
cases and other non-criminal matters to free up courtrooms in the Antelope 
Valley, South Bay and Santa Monica until there are sufficient funds to build 
courthouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Courthouse construction funds come from a portion of general court fines, 
court-imposed traffic school fees and parking citations. After rising through 
the late 1980s, the annual revenue for courthouse construction has been 
dropping steadily since 1989. Annual revenue fell from $25 million that year to 
$16.5 million in the last fiscal year, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The county would face deficits of up to $312 million over a nine-year period 
if it continues with plans to build all 10 courthouses, partly because 
projected costs have gone up dramatically, the report states. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is scheduled to come before the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Court administrators and judges warned that many existing courthouses are 
already severely overcrowded and lack proper security. 
</P>
<P>
 The Torrance project had an estimated cost of $47.9 million and was expected 
to include 12 courtrooms and 18 judges' chambers, a large lock-up area for 
prisoners and spacious jury service waiting areas for both the municipal and 
superior courts. 
</P>
<P>
 The overcrowding got so bad last year that the Superior Court began 
transferring cases expected to last longer than two weeks out of Torrance to 
other courthouses. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a need for all those new courthouses," said Rob Quist, deputy court 
administrator for the Administratively Unified Courts, adding that leasing 
space in the interim will not solve the problem. "Our projections show that by 
the year 2010, we're going to need 30 courts up in the Antelope Valley alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Reed recommends proceeding with the projects in Chatsworth and near Los 
Angeles International Airport largely because the county has sunk about $40.2 
million into those courthouses. Both projects are ready to begin construction 
in the next fiscal year, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county should proceed to construction to avoid loss of the substantial 
investment to date," the report states.

SOUTH BAY HOSPITAL STUDIES ITS OPTIONS; MEDICINE: REDONDO BEACH FACILITY HOPES 
MANAGEMENT CHANGES AND NEW HEALTH-CARE CONTRACTS WILL OFFSET IMPACT OF CIGNA'S 
DEPARTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Battered by the impending loss of its largest health-care contract, South Bay 
Hospital in Redondo Beach is pondering how to keep its doors open amid 
financial losses and stiff competition for patients. 
</P>
<P>
 One option could be turning over management of part or all of the facility to 
another medical center. Discussions have been held with nearby Little Company 
of Mary Hospital in Torrance, but officials at both hospitals said no decisions 
have been made. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital is also pursuing more health-care contracts to replace the 
business it will lose in March when Cigna Health Care of California moves its 
patients to another hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The uncertainty is stirring concern in the beach cities. Not only does the 
203-bed hospital provide residents with easily accessible care, but its 1960 
building on Prospect Avenue is owned by a public agency, the Beach Cities 
Health District. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the next two or three months, the story will unfold," said Robert Riley, 
executive director of the district, which leases the hospital to American 
Medical International, a for-profit national hospital chain. The 30-year lease 
is due to expire in 2014. 
</P>
<P>
 Riley said his question is not whether the hospital will close but whether it 
will have to reduce or close some departments. He said he is expecting a report 
from the hospital within the next few weeks on the impact of the Cigna 
withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 The most daunting problem facing South Bay Hospital is the loss of its 
managed-care contract with Cigna, which accounts for as much as 22% of its net 
revenue, said executive director Dennis Bruns. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility, Bruns said, has also been hurt by the recession and competition 
with its two larger Torrance rivals: Little Company, which has 374 beds, and 
Torrance Memorial Medical Center, with 340. 
</P>
<P>
 With the growing emphasis nationwide on outpatient care as a cheaper 
alternative to hospitalization, some local health officials have questioned if 
the area can support all its existing hospitals. Three hospitals are located in 
Torrance and Redondo Beach alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it really takes a genius to say we're really over-bedded in the 
South Bay," Bruns said. 
</P>
<P>
 South Bay Hospital is operated by American Medical International. The hospital 
has struggled financially in recent years, losing $4.5 million to $4.8 million 
in operating income in the fiscal year ending in August, 1992, and slightly 
more than $2 million in the last fiscal year, Bruns said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it is losing not only the Cigna contract, but its association to the South 
Bay Family Medical Group, a 10-physician primary care group that beginning in 
March will be managed by Little Company of Mary Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruns said his hospital is working hard to build up its ties to other medical 
groups and health maintenance organizations. It recently signed a Medi-Cal 
contract with the state and is strengthening its own network of independent 
physicians to replace some of its lost business. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think we're going to be able to replace all of it" by March 1, Bruns 
said, "but if we can replace a substantial amount of it, it certainly helps the 
hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 On another front, South Bay Hospital contacted its two Torrance rivals -- 
Little Company and Torrance Memorial -- about six months ago to explore 
partnerships and joint efforts, Bruns said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the talks did not progress at that time, according to Bruns, Little 
Company officials are currently evaluating if the hospital has any interest in 
South Bay operations.

SHRINE ERECTED FOR SLAIN OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The day after Manhattan Beach Police Officer Martin Ganz was killed while 
making a traffic stop, grieving relatives, friends and strangers began placing 
wreaths and bouquets outside a Bank of America branch in Manhattan Beach 
Village near where the officer was shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the site, above, has become a shrine to the officer, who died Dec. 
27 and was buried Monday at Inglewood Memorial Park after a ceremony attended 
by Gov. Pete Wilson and more than 2,500 law enforcement officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Flowers and candles are only part of the makeshift memorial. Everything from 
Reese's Peanut Butter Cups, which Ganz loved, to poems, letters of support to 
officers, and toy police motorcycles (Ganz was assigned to the department's 
motorcycle detail) have been spotted. 
</P>
<P>
 One poem reads in part: "Frustrating. That's what it's like to be a cop 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's some really personal things out there," said Lee King, a reserve 
officer who worked as Ganz's partner two days a week. "I've seen (drug 
awareness program) T-shirts, teddy bears and a lot of pictures and things from 
people who knew him personally." KIM KOWSKY

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; FUNDING CUT FOR DOWNTOWN DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has cut by nearly half a funding request from a group of 
businessmen and property owners needed to plan a business improvement district 
for downtown Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 The council agreed to spend $20,000 to fund the Downtown Burbank Stakeholders 
Assn. for three months, instead of the $38,000 that had been requested.The 
group said the original request would have kept it going for five months, but 
that plans for the improvement district could be completed within the shorter 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do hope to have the district finished by then," said Gwen Pentecost, the 
executive director. Pentecost said that in the next few months the group will 
develop a way for businesses and property owners to pay for improvements such 
as promotions, parking management and better maintenance to attract new 
customers to the area. 
</P>
<P>
 In other business Tuesday, the City Council named nine people to a Burbank 
Center Planning Area Citizen's Advisory Committee. The committee was supposed 
to have had 36 members, but the city did not get enough applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, before its holiday break, the City Council promised $23 million to help 
rebuild public schools, on the condition that voters approve a $100-million 
bond referendum to be placed on the ballot in April. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SYLMAR; PARENTS GATHER AT SCHOOL TO ESCORT STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Determined to do all they can to promote safety in their community, 
particularly while a San Fernando Valley serial child molester remains at 
large, a group of parents at El Dorado Avenue Elementary School are gathering 
after school every day to escort children home. 
</P>
<P>
 About half a dozen mothers, calling themselves the El Dorado Parent Safety 
Express, wait outside the school as children are dismissed, holding up signs to 
indicate the direction they will walk. Dozens of children who used to walk home 
alone or in small groups now join the larger, chaperoned groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Margarita Garcia, who has two daughters attending El Dorado, said parents 
formed the group after hearing news of the molester before winter break. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very worried," Garcia said. "Not only for our own children, but for 
other children too."  
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado Principal Dolores Palacio said the walking escort is just one of 
several safety measures that were implemented after news of the molester 
surfaced in November. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the school held emergency meetings to inform parents and staff 
members of the incidents. Teachers spoke to students using a police composite 
sketch to describe the suspected molester. But since more than half of the 
students walk home from school every day, she said, the escorts are especially 
helpful. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't only make the children feel secure, they have a calming effect on 
the whole community," Palacio said. 
</P>
<P>
 The serial child molester, who police say has stalked Valley schoolchildren 
since February -- accosting at least 32 youngsters -- has not been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. John Dunkin, a spokesman for the Los Angeles Police Department, said that 
while there have been no reported incidents by the molester since school was 
dismissed for the two-week winter break on Dec. 17, police have beefed up their 
presence anyway. "We had reduced the numbers while the kids were out of school, 
but we have renewed the intensity now that they are back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that police are continuing their investigation and following a number 
of leads. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, outside El Dorado, members of the Safety Express said they hope 
other parents will volunteer to join them even after the suspect is 
apprehended. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just that person," Garcia said. "There are others out there that can 
hurt children." SUSAN BYRNES

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; CITY TO PAY $27,000 FOR FLOOD DAMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Burbank City Council has released funds to pay a $27,000 settlement to 
three local business owners who had contended that a faulty sewer design caused 
property damage during a major flood two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the settlement, which the city and the business owners reached last 
month, Burbank does not admit to liability for the damage, said Carolyn Barnes, 
assistant city attorney for Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 "We alleged it was an act of God, or an act of nature," Barnes said Tuesday, 
when the council voted to release the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Four local business people filed the suits separately after the flooding that 
struck Burbank and other parts of Southern California on Feb. 10, 1992. The 
businesses were all in the Lake Street area of Burbank, which has a lower 
elevation than the rest of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "They felt the city should have designed a better storm drain system for the 
area," Barnes said. The parties to the lawsuit were Samuel and Suzanne 
Trussell, who own an aircraft parts manufacturing business, as well as business 
owners Mark Hines; Gustavo and Deborah Cabrera and Scott Dordick. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council agreed to settle in December when two businesses who the 
group also sued, Pacific Recycling and Lockheed Corp., agreed to settle. The 
terms of those settlements were not disclosed. ED BOND

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; GRANT TO ENABLE OIL RECYCLING TO CONTINUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Glendale fire officials have received a one-year, $60,000 state grant to 
continue a program to pick up used motor oil at homes for recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Integrated Waste Management Board issued the grant last month 
for the Glendale Fire Department's curbside collection program, said Vasken 
Demirjian, supervisor of the hazardous materials division. 
</P>
<P>
 Curbside collection started in April after the waste management board provided 
$75,000 in seed money to pay for a full-time environmental services worker and 
a truck to collect used motor oil, Demirjian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Every Thursday, the worker is available to pick up used motor oil from 
Glendale residents who schedule appointments in advance. As of this month, 
7,000 gallons of oil -- considered a hazardous waste by the state -- has been 
collected and recycled at a plant in Carson, Demirjian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Through a state incentive program, the Fire Department has also obtained $820 
for recycling used motor oil. Demirjian said that money has mainly been spent 
on gas and other supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant will cover salary costs and help pay for a forklift, estimated to 
cost $15,000, and other supplies, he said. TOMMY LI

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; SLAIN GUARD'S BOSS TESTIFIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A participant in an armed robbery appears to have intentionally killed a 
armored guard during the 1992 robbery of a San Fernando Home Depot, the 
victim's supervisor testified Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank O'Farrell, head of security for Sectran Security Transportation, 
testified in the trial of Sean Darnell Slade, who is accused of first-degree 
murder in the death of Edwin Maldonado, a former Pasadena police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Farrell said that whoever shot Maldonado must have wanted to kill him, 
because the 26-year-old -- who wore a bulletproof vest -- was shot twice in the 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 On the second day of testimony in Slade's trial in San Fernando Superior 
Court, O'Farrell, whose company provides armored vehicles to transport cash and 
receipts, said the robbery appeared to be well-planned. It was too much of a 
coincidence that both the camera and the alarm system at the store were 
disabled on the day of the holdup, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four people are believed to have participated in the robbery -- one driving 
the getaway car and three waiting near the vault for Maldonado. 
</P>
<P>
 "They approached him (guard) from the side and shot him immediately in the 
head. He did not have a chance," said O'Farrell, who was not at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Slade faces the death penalty if convicted of murder in the course of a 
robbery and while lying in wait. The other three participants have not been 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Bruce Hill said in opening arguments Tuesday that Slade had 
an alibi for the time of the murder. He said in an interview Wednesday that 
Slade picked up his wife in downtown Los Angeles around 4 p.m. on July 20, 
1992, about 45 minutes after the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial is expected to continue for about five weeks. CHAU LAM

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: 6 PICK UP FORMS FOR COUNCIL ELECTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six candidates have picked up nomination forms for the April 12 City Council 
elections, in which three seats on the five-member panel will be contested. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential candidates have until Jan. 14 to obtain 20 signatures of 
registered voters to qualify for the election, according to San Fernando 
Assistant City Clerk Wilma Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando does not have geographical council districts, so the top three 
vote-getters will win seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents Doude Wysbeek and Jose Hernandez are among the six who obtained the 
forms, but Mayor Dan Acuna is expected to request his nomination papers in the 
coming week, said Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Others who obtained nomination papers include John Becker and Ed Guzman, both 
members of the city's Transportation and Safety Commission. Political newcomers 
Joanne Baltierrez and Arthur Kay, a workers' compensation attorney, also have 
picked up nomination papers. GEOFFREY MOHAN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; COLD WEATHER SHELTER AVAILABLE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials who run a cold weather shelter at the National Guard armory in Van 
Nuys are hoping to get the word out to homeless adults that the program is 
still available despite a warm weather trend. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cold/Wet Weather Program provides transportation to the armory at 17330 
Victory Blvd., two hot meals, a shower and a cot. It is operated by the 
nonprofit L.A. Family Housing Corp. and funded by the city of Los Angeles 
Community Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, turnout is lower than usual for the program, which begins at 6 p.m. 
nightly through Feb. 20.  
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, we can get the word out to people who may be in need," said 
Michael Childress, a Family Housing Corp. administrator who helps coordinates 
the shelter. "There is a decrease in the numbers compared to the last three or 
four years. It used to be 100 to 105 people this time of year, but now it's 
only 80 to 89 a night." 
</P>
<P>
 Childress speculated that the drop in numbers might be attributed to warmer 
temperatures. " . . . Last year, it was raining and hitting the 30s every 
night," Childress said. "The weather has not been as severe" so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter is open from 6 p.m. nightly through Feb. 20, then only during cold 
weather from Feb. 21 through March 31. Although people must leave the shelter 
in the morning, there is no limit on how many nights they can return, Childress 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 To help those who cannot reach the shelter on their own, the program provides 
two 15-passenger vans that pick up shelter occupants about every 45 minutes 
between 5:30 and 8:35 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Pickup points include the public parking lot at Hansen Dam at the corner of 
Foothill Boulevard and Osborne Street in Lake View Terrace; Valley Community 
Clinic at 5648 Vineland Ave. in North Hollywood; Van Nuys City Hall at 14410 
Sylvan St. in Van Nuys, and 7024 Deering Ave. in Canoga Park. JEFF SCHNAUFER

CAUSE OF GASOLINE LEAK AT SHELL PLANT SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shell Oil officials are trying to determine what caused more than 71,000 
gallons of gasoline to leak from a Carson refinery tank last weekend, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Containment berms prevented the gasoline from escaping the immediate area 
around the 4.2-million-gallon storage tank on Sunday, and a gas cloud that 
formed over the spill dissipated quickly, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the leak wasn't immediately determined, but it is believed the 
storage tank might have been overfilled, Shell spokesman Bill Gibson said. The 
spill posed no danger to nearby residents, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Refinery workers plugged the leak.

COUNTY VOWS TO PROCEED WITH COURT IN CHATSWORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Faced with a shortage of money for courthouse construction, Los Angeles County 
officials are recommending indefinite postponement of six projects that have 
already cost millions of dollars, and completion of only two buildings -- one 
in Chatsworth and the other near Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations, released late Wednesday by Chief Administrative Officer 
Sally R. Reed, immediately touched off a storm of protest from officials who 
have been lobbying for an $80-million courthouse in the Antelope Valley city of 
Lancaster, and from residents of Chatsworth, who have sued the county to block 
construction of a $51.5-million facility there. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is scheduled to come before the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 16-page report, Reed recommends that the supervisors indefinitely 
postpone construction of six proposed courthouses that have already cost the 
county $16 million in land acquisition, design and other costs. The sites are 
in Lancaster, Pasadena, West Los Angeles, South Bay, Santa Monica and North 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other proposed projects -- in Southeast Los Angeles and Long Beach -- that 
have cost the county nothing to date should also be delayed indefinitely, the 
report states. 
</P>
<P>
 As a stopgap measure, Reed recommends that the county lease space for traffic 
cases and other non-criminal matters to free up courtrooms in the Antelope 
Valley, South Bay and Santa Monica until there are sufficient funds to build 
courthouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Courthouse construction funds come from a portion of general court fines, 
court-imposed traffic school fees and parking citations. After rising through 
the late 1980s, the annual revenue for courthouse construction has been 
dropping steadily since 1989, falling from $25 million that year to $16.5 
million in the latest fiscal year, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The county would face deficits of up to $312 million over a nine-year period 
if it continues with plans to build all 10 courthouses, partly because 
projected costs have gone up dramatically, the report states. 
</P>
<P>
 Court administrators and judges warned that many existing courthouses are 
already severely crowded and lack proper security. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a need for all those new courthouses," said Rob Quist, deputy 
administrator for the Los Angeles Municipal and Superior courts, adding that 
leasing space in the interim will not solve the problem. "Our projections show 
that by the year 2010, we're going to need 30 courts up in the Antelope Valley 
alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Mike Antonovich, who represents most of the San Fernando and 
Antelope valleys, "completely opposes" the recommendations and will propose 
Tuesday that the county build the Lancaster courthouse instead of the one in 
Chatsworth, said Lori Howard, an Antonovich aide. 
</P>
<P>
 The report acknowledges the need to replace the 30-year-old Antelope Valley 
courthouse, which is so small that cases are frequently transferred at least 45 
miles away to facilities where courtrooms are available. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of judges also recommended earlier in the fall that the board build 
the new Lancaster courthouse before the one in Chatsworth because rapid growth 
in the Antelope Valley has outstripped the capacity of the existing building. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reed recommends proceeding with the projects in Chatsworth and near LAX 
instead, largely because the county has already spent about $40.2 million on 
them, compared with only about $5.8 million on the Lancaster project. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction can begin on the projects in Chatsworth and near LAX in the next 
fiscal year, which begins in July, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county should proceed to construction to avoid loss of the substantial 
investment to date," the report states. 
</P>
<P>
 "Antelope Valley pays taxes too," Howard said. "At an absolute bare minimum, 
residents there deserve at least an adequate level of services." 
</P>
<P>
 "They got their head in the sand," Lancaster Mayor Arnie Rodio said. "I just 
wish they'd let us secede from the county. We don't get zip from those people." 
</P>
<P>
 In Chatsworth, residents who are suing the county to block construction of a 
courthouse said they were disappointed in the recommendations, and vowed to 
press on with their opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they chose the wrong place," resident John Lindsay said.

PAYMENTS TO MARGARITO PROBED BY D.A.; SAN FERNANDO: FIRED PARKS DIRECTOR FAILED 
TO REPORT $14,000 IN CONTRIBUTIONS, LOANS OR INCOME IN LATE 1980S, A COURT 
AFFIDAVIT SHOWS.

<P>
 Fired parks director Jess Margarito failed to report more than $14,000 in 
campaign contributions, loans or income while he was a councilman and mayor of 
San Fernando in the late 1980s, a court affidavit filed by the Los Angeles 
County district attorney's office showed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are questioning a series of payments to Margarito -- who was 
dismissed from his San Fernando post by the City Council Monday night -- from a 
nonprofit immigration group, Immigration Services of Santa Rosa, and its 
executive director, Eduardo Palacios, according to an affidavit filed as part 
of a request for a warrant to search Margarito's bank records. The payments 
were made when Margarito served on the group's board of directors, according to 
the an affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office has seized 12 canceled checks totaling $14,850, 
written from February, 1987, through June 30, 1992, according to the affidavit 
signed by Tom Melbourn, a district attorney's special investigator. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of the checks -- $10,600 -- came from accounts held by Palacios, 
although three checks totaling $4,250 came from the group itself, according to 
the affidavit. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the checks were written to Margarito or his election and political 
action committees, and eight of the 12 were not reported on campaign disclosure 
forms as required by state law, the affidavit says. In addition, Margarito 
failed to report some loans and payments on state-required income-disclosure 
forms while he was a San Fernando councilman from 1984 to 1990, and later when 
he became parks director, the affidavit alleges. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations in the affidavit indicate for the first time that the 
nine-month investigation of Margarito has expanded beyond his actions as head 
of the city Recreation and Community Services Department from 1990 until his 
firing Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Palacios told The Times that he frequently gave money to help Margarito's 
campaigns, but eventually felt Margarito was trying to "milk" the immigration 
group, and complained to law enforcement authorities. The district attorney's 
investigation of Margarito started soon after Palacios complained last 
February, Palacios said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the actions that peeved Palacios was Margarito's request for a $3,500 
donation to his parks department in February, 1993. Margarito said Wednesday 
that the money was to go for a program for immigrant children, the type of 
donation the immigration group had made on other occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 But Palacios offered a starkly different version Wednesday: "That's when the 
whole deal started -- the whole investigation," Palacios said. "I was sick and 
tired of this." 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's investigation began in April, centering on allegations 
that Margarito falsified time cards for criminal convicts assigned to work off 
sentences in parks, and submitted false invoices resulting in the city paying 
more than $2,000 for work that allegedly was not done. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, which had ordered its Police Department to look into the charges 
in October, dismissed Margarito based on the latter allegations Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Margarito on Wednesday acknowledged he had made errors in reporting eight 
checks totaling $13,300 identified in the affidavit. One of them -- for $7,000 
-- was a loan from Palacios that he paid back, Margarito said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another check, for $4,000, was for fees for consulting work he performed for 
Immigration Services of Santa Rosa, Margarito said. He said his failure to 
report the others was an oversight and that some have since been clarified with 
the investigator. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always tried to maintain my own records, and these were sloppy errors," 
Margarito said. "There was no intent to do anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Margarito described Palacios as one of his biggest contributors, and said he 
never accepted contributions from Immigration Services of Santa Rosa. The 
$4,000 consulting-fee check from the service was for writing its bylaws and 
helping set up the group, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the affidavit, quoting Palacios, alleges that Margarito solicited the 
$4,000 as payment for his service on the board -- a violation of the group's 
bylaws -- and that Margarito persuaded Palacios to list it as consulting fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Palacios confirmed that version of events to The Times on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were not services," said Palacios. "He asked me to give it to him. I 
don't want to get involved in that one until I go to court."

TREATING THE BODY, LIFTING THE SPIRIT; HEALTH CARE: T.H.E. CLINIC, THE COUNTY'S

 When Ada Sellers went to her doctor in September for a pregnancy test, she 
figured that the most shocking news she could get was that she was expecting a 
child, at the age of 46. 
</P>
<P>
 She was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers' doctor sat her down and broke the news that not only was she 
pregnant, she was HIV-positive. Sellers said that because she was in a 
longtime, monogamous relationship, she was at a loss to explain how she 
contracted the virus, and she said her doctors have yet to determine the 
source. But after the initial disbelief came something worse: fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cried and walked the floor a long time that night," recalled Sellers, a 
mother of five. "I couldn't sleep. I didn't know who to talk to. I didn't know 
what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Sellers finally picked up the phone and called an HIV hot line, and through it 
discovered the T.H.E. Clinic for Women, a community-based facility at 3860 W. 
Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. that specializes in treating women with AIDS and 
HIV infections. Today, Sellers says she is feeling much more hopeful, thanks to 
the clinic's support. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are there for you in so many ways," she said. "I can call whenever I 
have a problem. They take care of all my medical needs. If it wasn't for them, 
I don't know where I'd be." 
</P>
<P>
 The T.H.E. Clinic -- the acronym stands for To Help Everyone -- has been 
hailed as a pioneer in health care tailored for women. Since opening in 1974, 
it has offered comprehensive medical and psychological services for minority 
and low-income women, and today offers the largest program for HIV and 
AIDS-infected women in the county, said director Sylvia Drew Ivie.  
</P>
<P>
 Serving women is not the only reason the clinic is special. Similar medical 
facilities may offer services in Spanish, but T.H.E. Clinic has 62 physicians 
and other staffers who speak 10 languages, including Spanish, Japanese, Thai, 
Tongan and Vietnamese. It serves nearly 20,000 patients annually, including 115 
in the HIV program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women, particularly women of color, need different kinds of intervention than 
men," said Ivie, a former civil rights lawyer who has headed the clinic for 
five years. "Also, information needs to be discussed with a Japanese woman very 
differently than it's discussed with an African American or Latino. We operate 
from that standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic offers a wide array of services that have increased in scope as 
health problems have grown more complex. It not only provides gynecological and 
general primary health care, but prenatal care, pediatric services, 
psychosocial counseling, parenting classes and a teen health program that added 
a peer counseling component in November. "We're treating teens like a community 
with another language," said Ivie, who employs 18 students from local high 
schools as part-time workers. "We train them to give each other information, to 
cut through problems like peer pressure and self-esteem. An adult telling them, 
'This is birth control' is much less effective than one of their peers saying, 
'Can you deal with this?' " 
</P>
<P>
 For all of its innovations and the rave reviews it regularly gets from the 
health care community and elected officials, Ivie says she wonders where her 
clinic, which is 80% government-funded, will fit in with the plans for national 
health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Though T.H.E. charges fees based on each patient's ability to pay, half of its 
patients are on Medi-Cal, and many more are immigrants who don't have 
insurance. "The need for our services will exist, but I don't know if we will 
be cost-efficient enough," Ivie said. "It's a little worrisome." 
</P>
<P>
 For HIV patient Beverly Mosley, 46, no price can be put on the support the 
clinic gives her, particularly during personally trying times. "They make you 
feel like you're family," she said. "At other places, you're a dollar. Here, I 
do volunteer work when I'm not a patient. That's how much I owe them."

AROUND THE VALLEY: NOTHING SHAKES HIS SHAPE-UP RESOLVE, UNLESS IT HAS PEPPERONI

 It's the first week of the new year. The holiday parties are now just fuzzy 
memories. No more excuses for overindulging. Can't justify taking that second 
piece of fudge or that second (or third) drink. It's time to face reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Like millions of other people, undoubtedly, I have resolved to lose weight 
this year. Not only the five pounds gained over the holidays (it's hard to 
resist mom's tamales), but the extra weight gained throughout the year from 
eating too many cheeseburgers and fries. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, I am not alone. According to health club officials, January is the 
busiest month of the year for signing up new members, thanks in no small part 
to clubs taking advantage of people's guilt and vulnerability after the 
holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Family Fitness Centers advertises itself as "Your New Year's resolution 
solution." LA Fitness Health Club says to "Start '94 right" with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Bally's Health & Tennis Corp., which owns or manages Holiday Spa, Nautilus 
Plus and The Sports Connection health clubs, doesn't blare it in large 
headlines. But in the small print says: "It's that time of year again. Time to 
make good on your promise. Y'know, the one you made on the scale about getting 
in shape. Remember?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I remember (thanks for reminding me). But I already belong to a health 
club, so at least I don't have to fork over the big bucks to join now. 
</P>
<P>
 So I started Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondays are generally the busiest day of the week (people feeling guilty about 
overindulging over the weekend), but this, the first Monday in the new year, 
was especially busy at The Sports Connection in Encino. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Park, the club's general manager, said a lot of new people had not 
signed up that day (he blames it on the recession, not on any new trend that 
it's hip to be fat). He said the crowd was made up of old members (like me) who 
had stopped coming regularly, but now decided to start working on keeping their 
New Year's resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Park said that most people looking to lose weight do so using cardiovascular 
equipment, such as exercise bikes, treadmills and stair climbers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sports Connection in Encino is big on cardiovascular equipment, with 23 
stair climbers, 21 exercise bikes and 16 treadmills (all facing two large 
television screens, one broadcasting CNN Headline News and the other Monday 
Night Football). On Monday night, three treadmills were out of commission, but 
even if all were operational, there is usually a waiting list to get on. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those waiting Monday night was Brian Greenberg of Encino, who, like me, 
is using the new year as a motivation to lose weight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came to the club regularly for about six months after buying a 2 1/2-year 
membership a year ago, but then I found a lot of reasons to stop coming," said 
Greenberg, 41, who works in advertising. "With the new year, I want to get back 
on track." 
</P>
<P>
 On his first day back, Greenberg spent 20 minutes on a stair climber, 15 
minutes working out with weights, and then 20 minutes on the treadmill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going easy," he said after getting off the treadmill, sweat visible on 
his white T-shirt and gray shorts. "If there's too much pain, I might not want 
to come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg said he is more likely to stick to his routine this year because 
"I'm just going to sacrifice some of those overtime hours to do something for 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 If he does stick with it, Greenberg will be the exception rather than the 
rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Pattenson, a personal trainer, said most people give up after three or 
four months. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just get discouraged when they don't see immediate results," said 
Pattenson, 33, who has been a personal trainer for nearly four years. "They 
tend to be unrealistic about results." 
</P>
<P>
 A 41-year-old Encino woman, who declined to give her name, said she has joined 
about 10 health clubs in her life, only to quit after a few months because she 
finds working out boring. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's harder to pack up and go to a gym as opposed to just putting on a pair 
of running shoes and go outside and run," she said, explaining that she was in 
the gym Monday night only to bond with her 19-year-old daughter, who works out 
regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 And guys, despite the ads that commonly feature fabulously fit women, men 
still make up the bulk of the people who work out in clubs, industry sources 
say. (The Sports Connection in Encino, with a 60% female membership, is an 
exception apparently.) 
</P>
<P>
 Park said that people forget that toned muscles weigh more than flab, which 
could mean a healthier you without losing much weight. 
</P>
<P>
 "It use to be that we used a formula for ideal weight based on height," said 
Park, the club manager. "Now, we look at the percentage of body fat." 
</P>
<P>
 Park said that, ideally, women should have no more than 18% to 20% body fat, 
while men should have 12% to 15%, max. But both men and women can have about 
25% body fat and still be fit, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's encouraging, but I still don't want to know my body fat percentage 
right now. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday night, I spent 45 minutes on an exercise bike and 20 minutes with the 
weights. I was going to do 15 minutes on the treadmill, but there was a waiting 
list. I'll catch it next time. 
</P>
<P>
 I headed straight for the sauna (my favorite part of the workout), and sat 
there for about 10 minutes as the steam soothed my muscles, which were already 
starting to ache. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time I got home, my body started reminding me that it had been awhile 
since I had been to the gym. My neck, shoulders, back and legs were getting 
sore and stiff. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, still a bit a sore, I was determined to stay on track. I planned 
to go to the gym after work. But then I realized I forgot to bring my gym 
clothes, so I went home and had pizza for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh well. Who keeps New Year's resolutions anyway?

RHYME AND REASON; PSYCHIATRIST USES POETRY TO HELP UNRAVEL PATIENTS' PROBLEMS 
</P>

<P>
 It was a helicopter crash in Vietnam that led psychiatrist Owen Heninger to 
discover the healing power of poetry therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A young soldier killed in the crash was the son of one of Heninger's patients, 
a dentist who had helped his son overcome some physical obstacles so he could 
enlist in the Army. After the young man's death, the father was overwhelmed 
with remorse, blaming himself, feeling suicidal. Heninger had been treating the 
man for about a month, but wasn't making much progress. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Heninger remembered a poem he had learned in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Heninger, 64, had never been much of a poetry enthusiast. There never seemed 
to be time for it. He'd been a soldier in the Korean War, then a pre-med 
student at Brigham Young University, then a medical school student, a doctor, a 
psychiatrist. He was a scientist, not a dreamy poetry lover. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there was something about the poem that he remembered. The poem was 
Matthew Arnold's "Sohrab and Rustum," an adaptation of an ancient Persian work 
about a warrior who mistakenly kills his own son. It reads, in part: 
</P>
<P>
 For some are born to do great deeds, and live,  
</P>
<P>
 As some are born to be obscured, and die.  
</P>
<P>
 Do thou the deeds I die too young to do,  
</P>
<P>
 And reap a second glory in thine age:  
</P>
<P>
 Thou art my father, and thy gain is mine.  
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't get to talk to his son before he died," Heninger says, "and I 
thought that the words the son says in the poem might give him solace." 
</P>
<P>
 After Heninger gave him the poem, the father came out of his depression and 
was able to go back to work, the psychiatrist says.  
</P>
<P>
 Heninger didn't make too much of it at the time, but about seven years later 
he was treating a woman also suffering from depression over a child's death. 
Recalling the earlier case, Heninger suggested that the woman read and write 
poetry.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I read the poems she wrote, I saw that she was saying things she 
couldn't or wouldn't say in therapy," Heninger says.  
</P>
<P>
 In particular, Heninger says, a poem the woman wrote revealed her hatred for 
her brother-in-law, whom she blamed for her daughter's death.  
</P>
<P>
 Heninger used the feelings revealed in the poem to treat the woman. 
"Eventually she recovered," Heninger says. 
</P>
<P>
 Success with two patients made him realize that poetry could be helpful in his 
work. "I put two and two together. Here were two people who had recovered 
through this unusual treatment involving poetry. . . . I just stumbled onto it, 
like the guy who used mold to treat a wound and later found out it was 
penicillin." 
</P>
<P>
 What Heninger had stumbled onto was in fact a longstanding but relatively 
obscure form of therapy that a few psychologists and psychiatrists were already 
using. 
</P>
<P>
 After attending a UCLA course on poetry therapy taught by psychologist Arthur 
Lerner, a pioneer in the field who had been using it since the 1940s, Heninger 
jumped into poetry therapy with both feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he already had enough degrees to fill a good-sized wall, he went back 
to school, taking literature and poetry classes at Rio Hondo College and Cal 
State Fullerton while maintaining his practice. Last summer, he received a 
Registered Poetry Therapist Credential from the National Assn. for Poetry 
Therapy, one of only about a dozen mental health professionals who hold the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 And what exactly is poetry therapy? 
</P>
<P>
 There are two forms, Heninger said. One involves exposing patients to poetry 
written by others that will "strike a healthful resonance" within the patient, 
such as the effect the Arnold poem had on the father of the dead soldier. One 
poet Heninger uses often with his patients is Emily Dickinson, who he admits is 
his favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has written poems that describe post-traumatic stress disorder better 
than the textbooks," Heninger says, citing a Dickinson poem that includes the 
lines, "After great pain, a formal feeling comes." 
</P>
<P>
 The other, more active form of poetry therapy involves poetry written by the 
patient, which Heninger says can serve as "a window to the soul." 
</P>
<P>
 "The ordinary defenses may be bypassed by poetry. . . . Writing poetry has 
allowed unconscious material to become conscious, overcoming or bypassing 
repression, and has brought about genuine self-recognition," he wrote in a 
journal for mental health professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 Heninger goes over patients' poetry with them, line by line, to uncover the 
meanings that they did not consciously know were there. Often, Heninger says, 
"poetry reveals, but it reveals by concealing. . . . Instead of saying 'you 
dirty S.O.B.,' you put it in poetic terms." 
</P>
<P>
 Again Heninger cites Dickinson:  
</P>
<P>
 "Tell all the Truth but tell it slant --  
</P>
<P>
 Success in Circuit lies  
</P>
<P>
 Too bright for our infirm Delight  
</P>
<P>
 The Truth's superb surprise  
</P>
<P>
 As Lightning to the Children eased  
</P>
<P>
 With explanation kind  
</P>
<P>
 The Truth must dazzle gradually  
</P>
<P>
 Or every man be blind  
</P>
<P>
 Although only a relative handful of Heninger's patients are undergoing poetry 
therapy -- he also uses more traditional forms of psychotherapy and medication 
-- he believes there could be a value in it for almost everyone except the 
drug-addicted or extremely psychotic. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's poetry in everybody," he says, "although they may not think of it as 
poetry." 
</P>
<P>
 Heninger and other advocates of poetry therapy admit that not everyone in the 
mental health field is sold on the concept. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not everyone is accepting of it," says Lerner, editor of "Poetry in the 
Therapeutic Experience." "But I think as there is gradually a better 
understanding of what it's about, it is going to be used more and more." 
</P>
<P>
 Heninger hopes that his scheduled appearance with Lerner and other poetry 
therapy experts at the American Psychiatric Assn. Convention in Philadelphia 
this year will generate interest among psychiatrists. 
</P>
<P>
 "If other psychiatrists find poetry therapy as useful as I have," Heninger 
says, "I think it's going to keep growing and growing and growing."

 A special Los Angeles police unit failed in its duty to serve and protect, by 
watching bandits break into a restaurant where a woman was closing up shop and 
then stopping patrol officers from responding to her 911 call, a lawyer said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorney for the police, meanwhile, countered that the officers followed 
department procedure and tried to protect the restaurant manager from harm 
while still apprehending the robbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Such were the opposing interpretations of the fatal shooting outside a 
McDonald's restaurant in Sunland four years ago, now the subject of a lawsuit 
filed against the city of Los Angeles and the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Hiddleson, attorney for the restaurant manager, said the Police 
Department's Special Investigation Section should have stopped the gun-wielding 
bandits before they made their way into the McDonald's the night of Feb. 11, 
1990. That way, he said, the robbers never would have tied up his client, 
Robbin L. Cox, terrorized her and forced her at gunpoint to open the restaurant 
safe or risk death. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a large amount of force there," Hiddleson told a six-man, six-woman 
jury in Glendale Superior Court. "There was a request for assistance, and there 
was a failure to respond." 
</P>
<P>
 His opening statement was short on detail, Hiddleson said afterward, because 
he wanted to simply lay out how the robbery occurred and describe the police 
response, and then let the SIS members' testimony address the issues of whether 
they were negligent in allowing the robbery to occur. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are specific guidelines" officers should adhere to, Hiddleson said. 
"They did not follow them in this instance." 
</P>
<P>
 Cox, 26, of Pasadena contends police were negligent when a dispatcher promised 
to send patrol units to the scene, and that SIS officers then stopped them from 
coming. She said she has suffered emotional trauma, and contended that the SIS 
officers allowed the robbery to take place so they could build a case against 
the four men, who were suspects in a string of similar holdups. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy City Atty. Don Vincent, representing the city and Police 
Department, countered that the police were doing their job as best they could 
when they followed the four men from Venice to the Foothill Boulevard 
restaurant and watched the robbery unfold. 
</P>
<P>
 The four men -- three were fatally shot that night by SIS officers -- were 
believed to be carrying loaded weapons. A fourth man was shot and wounded, and 
later sentenced to 17 years in prison. Police learned after the shooting that 
the men were actually using pellet guns. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they had gone in that night, we might have had a hostage situation and 
jeopardized everyone involved," Vincent told the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 He said more than 18 of the specially trained SIS officers had surrounded the 
McDonald's, and did not stop the men because they had orders to arrest them 
only after they gathered as a group. 
</P>
<P>
 But the suspects fanned out around the building, he said, and some entered 
from the one blind side where the officers could not see them. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing the officers could do at that time, knowing the suspects 
were armed, or probably armed," Vincent said. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI continues to investigate the shooting. And it was disclosed Wednesday 
that the Los Angeles County district attorney's office also is continuing its 
investigation of the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're probably a couple of months away" from finishing the probe, Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Christopher Darden said. "There have been shooting investigations 
that last four years before. That's not uncommon." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, who has defended the SIS squad's actions 
in court depositions, may take the stand as early as today.

FAMILY OF MAN KILLED AT ATM IS SUING BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON MOESER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The wife and children of a man gunned down at a Bank of America ATM machine in 
Lancaster are suing the financial institution for $60 million, alleging the 
machine was installed in a location that invited crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney R. Rex Parris filed the suit in Lancaster Superior Court on Tuesday 
on behalf of Verena Herzog, her son, Brenden, 17, and daughter, Heidi, 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Hans Christian Herzog, 46, was killed March 5 near the ATM, located at the 
rear of the bank in the 700 block of West Lancaster Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men, Christopher A. Mann and Wesley Harper, were later arrested in the 
slaying. Their trials are scheduled to begin in the coming weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Parris said Verena Herzog was reluctant to file the civil suit against Bank of 
America, but wanted to ensure her children's future would be secure following 
the loss of their father. At the time of the shooting, Hans Herzog was the 
family's sole income provider. Verena Herzog is a homemaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "She did not want to sue," Parris said of Verena Herzog. "She's not the type 
of person. They're very religious people. She just wanted to take care of her 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 The Herzogs were not the first to sue a bank after a family member was killed 
at an ATM machine. Parris said the suits are quite common. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, the parents of a pregnant women slain at an automated teller 
machine in Sherman Oaks filed suit for unspecified damages. In April, the 
family of an Encino man killed while using an ATM settled a wrongful death suit 
against Wells Fargo Bank for an undisclosed sum. 
</P>
<P>
 Parris said Bank of America knew the ATM at its Lancaster Boulevard branch was 
in a poor location, at the back of the bank where it cannot be seen from any 
side streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "They know what ATM machines are dangerous," he said. "They know what 
precautions should be taken." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Herzog was killed, Parris said, Bank of America has hired a security 
guard to keep watch over the ATM machines at its Lancaster Boulevard branch. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank of America officials declined comment.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; HOME DEPOT OPENS DOORS OF CANYON COUNTRY 
STORE; BUSINESS: THE RETAILER IS EXPECTED TO GENERATE ABOUT $270,000 ANNUALLY 
IN LOCAL SALES TAX REVENUES. ABOUT 100 JOBS ARE FILLED BY LOCAL RESIDENTS.

<P>
 The largest home improvement retail outlet in the Santa Clarita Valley will 
open today, promising long-awaited increases in sales tax revenues and 
employment opportunities for this bedroom community but dashing the hopes of 
thousands of job-seekers who applied for 140 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The 102,000-square-foot Home Depot store at 20642 Golden Triangle Road is the 
first major discount home improvement retailer in the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canyon Country store is expected to contribute an average of $270,000 
annually in sales tax revenues to the city -- nearly doubling the current 
annual sales tax revenues of $300,000 generated by construction suppliers -- 
according to Steve Stark, city finance director. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to producing new sales and property tax revenues, the new store 
will provide more than 140 new jobs. About 40 of the employee positions were 
filled by transfers from other stores while about 100 positions were filled by 
local job seekers, said Eric Henry, assistant store manager. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 6,000 job-seekers -- "an unusually high number," according to Henry 
-- have filed for positions since the store began accepting applications in 
mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
 The store will feature a separate 28,000-square-foot garden center with a 
7,000-square-foot, climate-controlled enclosure for house plants. More than 
30,000 different items are in stock, including building materials, home 
improvement and lawn and garden products. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the chain's 260 retail outlets in 22 states across the nation generate 
an average of $40 million in annual sales, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction workers this week are completing about $1.06 million in street 
improvements to Golden Triangle Road at Reuther Avenue, providing a realignment 
of roads and new railroad crossing leading to the store. 
</P>
<P>
 Under agreements between the city and the Atlanta-based retailer, the city 
will reimburse Home Depot about $690,000 in street improvement costs, to be 
paid over the next seven years from sales tax revenues generated by the 
retailer, Stark said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita Mayor George Pederson and officials of the Canyon Country and 
Santa Clarita Valley chambers of commerce will participate in a ribbon-cutting 
ceremony at 9 a.m. to mark the opening. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Haviland, city marketing and economic development manager, said 
feasibility studies and marketing surveys concluded "from a marketing 
prospective that we clearly had an unmet need." He said the opening of the new 
store is evidence of Santa Clarita "continuing to strengthen its identity as a 
retail center."

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI; HE HAS A TEAM LIKE THIS, YET HE'S THE 
SAME OLD DEAN 
</P>

<P>
 The Atlantic Coast Conference schedule has begun, which means it's time for 
North Carolina Coach Dean Smith to do what he does best: poor-mouth and win 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith is the only guy who could look at the Venus De Milo and criticize it for 
missing an arm. The overwhelming favorite to win the ACC and perhaps a second 
consecutive national championship, Smith will say only that the Tar Heels will 
contend for the league title. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there are a lot of contenders out there," he warned. 
</P>
<P>
 Is that so? How many of them have four returning starters, including Final 
Four outstanding player Donald Williams and three seniors--elite center Eric 
Montross, the invaluable and indispensable point guard Derrick Phelps and 
forward Brian Reese, who has his moments? 
</P>
<P>
 Also at Smith's disposable is freshman forward Jerry Stackhouse, freshman 
center Rasheed Wallace and freshman guard Jeff McInnis, all of whom could start 
for about 99% of the other Division I programs. In fact, Stackhouse might be a 
full-time starter by midseason. 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out Smith's rotation is guard Dante Calabria, who recently scored 20 
points as a replacement for the injured Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Smith insists on repeating the company line, going so far to say that 
nearly every ACC game will "go down to the wire." 
</P>
<P>
 "Any game is up for grabs and has been in this league for a long time," Smith 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a nice thought, but at the moment the ACC is a three-team conference. 
There's North Carolina, Duke, Georgia Tech and then lots of question marks. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland has Joe Smith, a skinny 6-foot-9 1/2 freshman center whose 
early-season performances have been a lot more exciting than his name. But the 
Terrapins, who managed to upset Georgia Tech on Tuesday night, have only 11 
scholarship players, thanks to the aftereffects of NCAA probation. Give Coach 
Gary Williams another year, then talk to us. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida State reached the Final Eight last season but won't this time around. 
An early marshmallow schedule can't compensate for the recent loss of key 
sophomore swingman Derrick Carroll, who will undergo shoulder surgery Jan. 14 
and then be redshirted. The Seminoles have lots of guards, but not much 
front-court experience or depth. 
</P>
<P>
 Clemson has center Sharone Wright and forward Devin Gray, but the backcourt is 
something of a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 Wake Forest lost Rodney Rogers to the NBA and prized recruit Makhtar Ndiaye to 
NCAA rules violations. Virginia lost Corey Alexander to injury. Meanwhile, 
North Carolina State merely loses. The Wolfpack suffered embarrassing defeats 
to tiny Campbell and later, to Davidson. Many more like that and likable North 
Carolina State Coach Les Robinson will start feeling the heat from impatient 
fans. HAS NCAA SENT NDIAYE THEIR WAY? 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA isn't the only team courting Ndiaye. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan desperately needs a power forward to help fill part of the void left 
by Chris Webber's early departure to the NBA. 
</P>
<P>
 Ndiaye was ruled ineligible to play at Wake Forest because the school, 
according to the NCAA, gained an unfair advantage during the recruitment of the 
6-9, 245-pound prospect from Senegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Ndiaye, who is eligible as soon as a transfer is finalized, could help any 
program. For UCLA, Ndiaye could help solidify the Bruins' chances at a Final 
Four run. Or the coaching staff and player could agree to a redshirt season, 
saving him for a 1993-94 debut. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan has no such luxury. The Wolverines aren't exactly in dire 
straits--they are ranked No. 13--but it's obvious that Coach Steve Fisher has 
little depth on the front court. Truth be told, the Fab Four needs help. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan recently suffered a 119-95 loss to Arizona, the Wolverines' worst 
defeat since a 20-point loss to Duke in the 1991-92 NCAA championship game. It 
won't get any easier for the Wolverines now that the Big Ten Conference 
schedule has begun. In fact, four of Michigan's next five games are on the 
road. 
</P>
<P>
 Ndiaye, a sweetheart of a person, still doesn't understand why he was 
penalized for Wake Forest's recruiting mistake. But those are the rules--silly 
as they sometimes are--and the reason why UCLA's Jim Harrick and Michigan's 
Steve Fisher will be holding their breath for an answer. THERE'S A STORM 
BREWING INSIDE 
</P>
<P>
 Seventh-ranked Temple continues to win, but you wouldn't know it by listening 
to Coach John Chaney. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaney said he was thankful for the Owls' record, but that was about it. He 
then proceeded to rip his front-court players, most notably, center William 
Cunningham and forwards Jason Ivey and Derrick Battie. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of knowing how long this is going to continue," he said. "These 
kids have been in a drought for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Chaney is steamed because the Owls' inside game is nonexistent. Cunningham, 
Ivey and Battie haven't been able to make a thing--layups, short jumpers, even 
free throws. "And it's going to rip us up like lightning," Chaney said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not entirely true. Chaney is blessed with a backcourt that includes 
Rick Brunson, Aaron McKie and swingman Eddie Jones. Against St. Joseph's a 
couple of nights ago, the three players accounted for 58 of Temple's 67 points. 
</P>
<P>
 And therein, Chaney said, is the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden I start calling special plays (for Brunson, McKie and Jones) 
from the beginning of the game," he said. "It just shouldn't happen. It just 
shouldn't happen. I don't have that many plays in my book. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's over-coaching. It's driving me crazy." HE HAS HIS GATORS OFF AND 
RUNNING 
</P>
<P>
 Florida hired Lon Kruger four years ago to stabilize a Gator program in 
disarray. Now the no-nonsense Kruger, after 11-, 19- and 16-victory seasons, 
appears to be positioning the Gators for a possible NCAA tournament invitation, 
which would be their first since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Already Florida has beaten then-No. 20 Oklahoma State, Villanova and Texas in 
nonconference play, and the Gators (10-2) defeated Louisiana State on Wednesday 
night. It was the first time since the 1986-87 season that a Florida team began 
its January schedule with as many victories. For what it's worth, that was the 
same season Florida advanced to the Sweet 16 of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year the Gators didn't record their 10th victory until Jan. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would think the surprise team in our league to this point has been the 
University of Florida," Georgia Coach Hugh Durham said. 
</P>
<P>
 If so, Kruger can thank sophomore forward Dametri Hill, who has lost more than 
60 pounds since arriving at Florida. He now weighs 290. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dametri's confidence is high," Kruger said. "He feels he can score." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill leads the Gators in scoring (14.2 point average). And at the Rainbow 
Classic in Hawaii, Hill showed he could play some defense, holding All-American 
candidates Bryant Reeves of Oklahoma State and Clifford Rozier of Louisville to 
a combined 11 points and 10 rebounds. THE REST 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina, which almost always plays in some exotic holiday tournament, 
declined all invitations this season. The senior-laden team went to Dean Smith 
during the summer and asked that he not schedule any late-December games. For a 
change, the players wanted to go home for Christmas. The gracious Smith agreed, 
which meant the Tar Heels played Pittsburgh Dec. 20 and didn't play again until 
Jan. 2. . . . Kansas freshman guard Jacque Vaughn, who played at Muir High in 
Pasadena and is drawing boffo reviews from Jayhawk Coach Roy Williams, might be 
averaging 4.0--as in grades. Depending on his final test results in an English 
class, Vaughn could have ended his first semester at Kansas with straight A's. 
. . . Williams is one of many NCAA basketball coaches eagerly awaiting the 
start of next week's NCAA Convention in San Antonio. Among other things, the 
National Assn. of Basketball Coaches is going to push for a return to the 
14-scholarship level. Budget-cutting has reduced the total to 13. "I think we 
got more support," said Williams. "Whether we got enough support. . . . " Our 
guess: The 13-scholarship limit will stay. 
</P>
<P>
 At least Florida State Coach Pat Kennedy is honest about an early-season 
nonconference schedule that included the likes of Florida Atlantic, 
Bethune-Cookman, Morgan State, Mt. Saint Mary's and Lafayette. "This year I 
just wanted to give our kids a chance to make the (NCAA) tournament," Kennedy 
said. The reasons: Senior point guard Charlie Ward wasn't going to be available 
from football until Jan. 11 at the earliest, maybe as late as the 16th; senior 
guard Chuck Graham wasn't going to be back from reconstructive knee surgery 
until December and freshman guard Andre Cooper, who also played wide receiver 
for the Seminoles, wasn't going to be ready until after Jan. 2. "We thought it 
was the right thing to do," said Kennedy, who reminded everyone that Florida 
State's nonconference schedule next season includes Connecticut, Arizona and 
Florida--all in December. . . . Kennedy on Ward: "He's just taking a week away 
from everything. He's not answering the phone. He's just trying to rest 
mentally and physically." Ward isn't joining the team for tonight's game at 
Virginia. "I might bring his Heisman Trophy along with us," Kennedy said, "but 
he won't be there." 
</P>
<P>
 During a ceremony to retire Sidney Green's Nevada Las Vegas jersey number, 
Green made the mistake of thanking the UNLV administration, specifically school 
President Robert Maxson and Athletic Director Jim Weaver. Bad move. Maxson and 
Weaver were immediately booed by the crowd of 6,944. Speaking of crowds, UNLV 
is averaging about 8,900 after five home games. The Thomas & Mack Center seats 
18,500. The disappointing attendance figures are the product of a so-so 
team--the Rebels were 4-3 going into Wednesday night's game against 
Fullerton--and some last-minute scheduling that resulted in games played at 
home on Dec. 23 and 30. . . . So much for the predictions of Kentucky Coach 
Rick Pitino. "I thought it would be a recruiting year," he said. Instead, the 
Wildcats enter tonight's game against a mediocre Notre Dame team with a 10-1 
record and No. 4 ranking. A key factor has been the switch of Tony Delk from 
point guard, where he struggled, to shooting guard. "Once we moved him over . . 
. he's totally at ease," Pitino said. Pitino's mood could change, though, now 
that center Rodney Dent is out for the season because of a knee injury suffered 
Tuesday night. Top 10

AILING TITANS FALL TO SLUGGISH UNLV; BASKETBALL: WITH TOP SCORER PETERSON OUT 
WITH THE FLU, FULLERTON UNABLE TO MUSTER MUCH OFFENSE IN 77-66 LOSS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton left its offense on the bench while Nevada Las Vegas 
stumbled by the Titans, 77-66, Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, the Titan offense was wearing a black leather jacket, a green 
shirt and blue sweat pants. 
</P>
<P>
 Winston Peterson, with the flu. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't exactly the news Fullerton Coach Brad Holland needed an hour before 
tipoff -- Peterson is the Titans' leading scorer and rebounder. But, then 
again, this wasn't exactly the UNLV team of years past. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, this could be the year that Big West teams get revenge on the Rebels 
(5-3, 1-0). After scoring a mere 39 points on Monday against Virginia, the 
lowest total in school history, UNLV couldn't put Fullerton away on Wednesday 
-- and the Titans started one walk-on and suited up only eight players. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebel Coach Rollie Massimino's personal entourage is larger than that. Still, 
Fullerton was within 65-62 when Darren Little (16 points) dunked with 5:24 left 
and within 69-64 when James French (11) drove the lane for a bucket with 3:01 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kebu Stewart, who finished with a game-high 23 points, scored after a key 
offensive rebound on UNLV's next trip down. French turned the ball over after 
that, and a few minutes later, the Titans (2-8, 0-2) were still 
zero-for-Division I opponents for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end, Peterson was long gone. He sat on the bench during the first half 
but went home at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hasn't been feeling well the last couple of days," Holland said. "He told 
me before the game he couldn't go. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Winston is a strong inside player. He would have given us an inside presence 
we probably didn't have." 
</P>
<P>
 Without Peterson's nine rebounds per game (he is also averaging 17 points), 
the Titans were outrebounded, 46-38. Walk-on Fred Amos, who got his first start 
of the season, finished with four points and 10 rebounds in 32 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never played against (Peterson), so it's tough for me to make an 
analysis," Massimino said. "I'm sure he's a very good player. Their subs did a 
very good job, I thought." 
</P>
<P>
 After the Virginia debacle, Massimino was just happy to get a victory. Things 
have been anything but nirvana for the former Villanova coach. He got into a 
shouting match with a booster after Monday's game -- the booster just happened 
to be the cousin of Jerome Mack, one of the people for whom UNLV's Thomas & 
Mack Center is named. 
</P>
<P>
 So maybe it was a bad idea for Massimino to challenge the guy to come down to 
the floor and fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a very good win for us after the Virginia game," Massimino said. 
"It's a nice feeling because this shows we have some character." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, but despite shooting 31% from the field -- and 14% from three-point 
territory, Fullerton actually led for an eight-minute span in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 This also despite the fact that Peterson is the only Titan that can 
consistently bang under the boards. 
</P>
<P>
 But UNLV, it turns out, doesn't have much firepower, either. The Rebels spent 
at least half the game in a two-three zone and that enabled them to regain the 
lead they had lost during an exceptionally sluggish first half. 
</P>
<P>
 After French made two free throws with 6:09 left before the half to make it 
22-18, the Rebels scored 10 consecutive points before Greg Vernon (16 points) 
swished in a three-pointer at the 2:54 mark. 
</P>
<P>
 That made it 28-25, but, by halftime, the Titans trailed by six, 34-28. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, 11 points from substitute guard Ken Gibson -- who made 
three three-pointers -- was the main ingredient in the Rebels' avoiding a 
second consecutive loss in Titan Gym. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our guys were ready to play," said Holland, who has suffered as the Titans 
have come out ice-cold in the first half of nearly every game this season. "You 
could see it from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just told our guys that the greatest thing is to improve while you're 
winning. But I think we're improving while we're losing."

WOMEN'S BASKETBALL; UCLA, USC OPEN PLAY IN PACIFIC 10 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The USC and UCLA women's basketball teams begin Pacific 10 Conference 
competition tonight in the Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 USC (7-1) opens at Oregon State (8-2), and UCLA (5-4) plays at Oregon (6-3). 
The Trojans and Bruins switch opponents Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 USC had won six consecutive games before losing to No. 2-ranked Iowa last 
Thursday, 50-49, on a disputed, last-second three-point shot after leading most 
of the game.  
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's best outing was an 88-78 overtime victory over Rutgers on Monday. Bruin 
All-American Natalie Williams had a career-high 35 points, making 15 of 20 
shots, and also had 15 rebounds. USC didn't believe the running three-pointer 
by Iowa's Necole Tunsil beat the final horn, as both officials ruled. 
Apparently, however, Coach Cheryl Miller has bounced back from the 
disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Iowa game is over and done with," she said. "There's nothing we can do 
about it. It was good to know we can compete with the No. 2 team in the 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to 6-foot-5 senior All-American Lisa Leslie playing the best 
basketball of her career, the Trojans' hallmark has been depth. Eleven players 
are averaging at least 10 minutes per game.  
</P>
<P>
 Even Leslie has had help in reserve from 6-5 freshman Michelle Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's Williams has had help from 6-5 sophomore Zrinka Kristich, whose 
rebounding and scoring are both markedly up from last season. Kristich is 
averaging seven rebounds per game, but had 11 against Rutgers and 10 in a 
victory at North Carolina Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
 Amy Jalewalia, a 6-1 senior forward/guard, is averaging 15.6 points. Against 
Rutgers, after going scoreless in the first half, she scored 11 in the second 
half and eight in overtime.  
</P>
<P>
 UCLA is missing one element, however -- Williams' free-throw touch. Last 
season, she made 74.8% of her free throws. This season, she has made 50.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford, Pac-10 champion the last three seasons, opens conference play at 
Washington tonight and at Washington State on Saturday night.  
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinal is 7-2, losing only to national champion Texas Tech at Lubbock 
and to No. 1 Tennessee at Palo Alto. Anita Kaplan and Rachel Hemmer are leading 
Stanford with 16.6- and 15.3-point averages.

SKIING / CHRIS DUFRESNE; OLYMPIC QUALIFYING HAS SOME SCRAMBLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is there a fair way to pick an Olympic squad? The simple answer is yes. 
</P>
<P>
 Hold an Olympic trial and let the team select itself. 
</P>
<P>
 However, this allows for one-time fluke performances and sometimes keeps your 
best medal hopes at home. Ask Dan O'Brien, the world's best decathlete, who 
failed to make the 1992 Olympic team because he had a brain-cramp in pole vault 
at the trials. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, the U.S. ski team is correct in choosing its 22-person squad 
(maximum of 14 of either gender) based on overall performance on the World Cup 
circuit this season. 
</P>
<P>
 On the ski tour -- where course conditions can change in minutes to the 
benefit of one skier over another -- holding a one-day trial would be unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the selection process for the U.S. ski team, to be announced Feb. 7, is 
raising eyebrows because of the strict criteria it has set for qualification. 
</P>
<P>
 If the team were selected today, some of the United States' top medal hopefuls 
would not be going to Lillehammer. 
</P>
<P>
 The list would include 1992 silver medalists Diann Roffe-Steinrotter and 
Hilary Lindh, and Julie Parisien, once the top-ranked slalom skier in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 For the men, the qualifying criteria have been outlined as a top-eight or two 
top-15 finishes on the World Cup circuit. As of today, only Tommy Moe has 
locked up a spot, with two top-three finishes -- one in downhill, the other in 
super-giant slalom. 
</P>
<P>
 The criteria for the women are one of the following: a top-four finish, two 
top-eights or three top-15s. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the formula, two surprises on the women's team -- Heidi Voelker and 
Eva Twardokens, will secure Olympic spots. Voelker and Twardokens continued 
their success Wednesday in a giant slalom at Morzine, France, during which 
Voelker finished third and Twardokens fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, proven Olympians such as Roffe-Steinrotter, Lindh and Parisien are left 
to fight for their Olympic chances in World Cup races leading up to Feb. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 This, of course, is the kind of competitive tension the U.S. ski team had in 
mind with the formula. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an interesting situation," Paul Major, the U.S. Alpine director, said 
last week on a conference call to reporters. "The top athletes support the 
idea, they support this concept, they're 100% behind it." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if it means leaving the likes of Parisien at home? 
</P>
<P>
 "Very accurate," Major said. "And Julie knows it. Julie knows she needs to be 
a World Cup performer. She's had two top-15 results, she needs another top-15 
result." 
</P>
<P>
 While the ground rules appear hard and fast, there no doubt will be room for 
maneuvering. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrible course conditions in Europe last month wreaked havoc on the women's 
downhill circuit, making it hard to evaluate so-so performances by Picabo 
Street and Lindh, who is coming back from knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 And while it was once rumored that Major was considering taking fewer skiers 
than the 22 allotted, he's leaning toward taking a complete team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm unwilling to commit to that right now, looking at where we're at," Major 
said. "We have some weaknesses on the women's downhill team side and on the 
men's slalom side." 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a full squad would allow for the discretionary selection of skiers on 
the bubble. 
</P>
<P>
 Major also said the team selection process would be twofold. He will take one 
group based on its chances of medaling in '94. Another group will be composed 
of young skiers with projected medal hopes in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Those skiers would be selected if only to gain Olympic experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every athlete talks about it, they need Olympic experience," Major said. 
"They need to be able to go there. Tommy (Moe) talked about it in '92, how he 
was there, saw the hype and the pressure and how he dealt with that. So now 
he's going to be ready for Lillehammer." 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of decision-making could spell bad news for such veterans as 
Roffe-Steinrotter, the 1992 silver medalist in giant slalom, who has been in a 
slump since the Albertville Games. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a tough call. Bill Johnson, the 1984 downhill gold medalist, was left off 
the 1988 team based on poor World Cup performances that year, but he still 
argues he should have been named to the team based on his potential to win on a 
given day. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be similar debate concerning Roffe-Steinrotter. Not ready to give 
up the fight, she finished 13th at Wednesday's GS at Morzine. 
</P>
<P>
 Major will be left to make the distinction between medal potential and 
sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to pick a hard line and stick with it," he said, "because we 
believe we have winners on this team. We don't just want to take people to 
participate. We want to take people who either have potential to medal in '94 
or to medal in '98." 
</P>
<P>
 Ski Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Heidi Voelker has been promoted back to the Alpine A team after a month of 
outstanding World Cup results in Europe, including a career-best fifth in a GS 
at Tignes, France. Voelker has three top-10 finishes and two top-20s. . . . For 
the time being, Tommy Moe has surpassed AJ Kitt as America's best in speed 
events. . . . After a few weeks of soul-searching in the United States, Jeremy 
Nobis will rejoin the World Cup men's team in Europe. Nobis, considered 
America's best hope in GS, has been a flop so far this season. 
</P>
<P>
 For the sixth season, the Jeep/Eagle dealers and Chrysler are sponsoring a 
series of 14 free public ski race clinics and race program at various 
California resorts. The series will include prizes and medals for participants. 
Skiers must hold a valid lift ticket for that day of competition. The event 
will be held at Snow Summit in Big Bear this weekend, at Snow Valley on Feb. 
5-6, at Mammoth on March 5-6, and at Bear Mountain Feb. 12-13 and March 12-13. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it should come as no surprise in Norway that the first event to sell out 
for the upcoming Olympic Games at Lillehammer, was cross-country skiing. . . . 
Officials are hopeful snowboarding will be granted Olympic status for the 1998 
Games at Nogano, Japan. The sport has already been recognized as an "official 
discipline" by the International Ski Federation (FIS), and there are plans to 
sanction a World Cup snowboarding circuit for the 1994-95 season. Snowboarding 
will be a "cultural exhibition" at next months Olympic Games at Lillehammer. 
Skiing Magazine notes Snowboarding has a couple of other things going for it: 
One, the Japanese, hosts for the 1988 Games, are nuts about the sport and, two, 
both the head of the International Olympic Committee and the FIS have children 
who are snowboarders. 
</P>
<P>
 Next time you're in Aspen, see if you can bum a room off Prince Bandar bin 
Sultan bin Abdulaziz, Saudi Arabia's ambassador to the United States. In 1990, 
the prince built a 55,000 square-foot vacation home, valued at $25 million, 
that includes 15 bedrooms, 27 baths and 100 cable TV jacks. Feeling a bit 
cramped last year, the prince had constructed a cozy, 10,000 square-foot guest 
house.

LOCAL NOTES: DAVIS PROMISES A NEW STYLE FOR THE SALSA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Salsa General Manager Rick Davis, who was named coach of the American 
Professional Soccer League team Wednesday, promised an attacking, more 
entertaining style of soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa ended a three-month search by selecting Davis, a former U.S. 
national team captain and standout with the Cosmos of the North American Soccer 
League. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis replaces Rildo Menezes, who resigned under pressure after last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're going to see a different style of play this season," said Davis, who 
will remain as general manager. "I believe in a more entertaining, attacking 
style of play. Coach Menezes was more of a position-oriented coach. My 
philosophy is that when you have the ball, you have 11 attackers. And when you 
lose the ball, you have 11 defenders." 
</P>
<P>
 Menezes coached the Salsa to the APSL finals last spring. But that game, a 3-1 
overtime loss to Colorado at Titan Stadium, was a factor in the coaching 
change. With the Salsa leading, 1-0, with four minutes left in regulation, 
Menezes pulled league MVP Paulinho and replaced him with a defender. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, Salsa owner William De La Pena was furious with the coaching 
decision, and Menezes resigned soon afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said the Salsa's roster "will require some changes" to fit his 
aggressive style of play. The team began practicing Monday, and 11 players have 
tried out so far. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to beef ourselves up offensively," he said, "but I think the nucleus 
of the team will remain the same." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said Mike Fox has been named general manager of the Cobras, the Salsa's 
farm team. Davis said Octavio Zambrano, the Cobras' coach, will remain with the 
Salsa as an assistant coach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa also waived forward Phillip Gyau. 
</P>
<P>
 The APSL season is expected to start in late July. MIKE REILLEY

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; MONTGOMERY TO GET FIRST START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Staying with the hot back of the week, Coach Art Shell said Wednesday that Ty 
Montgomery will get his first start at tailback for Sunday's wild-card playoff 
game at the Coliseum against the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 The starting fullback won't be decided until the availability of Steve Smith 
(ankle injury) is determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Raiders started a backfield of Randy Jordan and Napoleon 
McCallum. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he didn't start last week against the Broncos in the regular-season 
finale, Montgomery was the Raiders' leading rusher with 44 yards in 13 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rocket Ismail, who suffered a sprained neck Sunday, worked out Wednesday, but 
did not put on pads and participate fully in practice. He is listed as 
questionable for Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders will play host to the Houston Oilers, Pittsburgh Steelers, Atlanta 
Falcons and New Orleans Saints next season in addition to their AFC West 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 On the road, they will face the Rams, the San Francisco 49ers, the Miami 
Dolphins and the New England Patriots plus their regular division rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's game is not yet a sellout. Unless the Raiders sell all 67,800 seats 
by 1 p.m. today, or receive an extension from the league, the game will be 
blacked out in Los Angeles. The Raiders did not reveal how they close they were 
to a sellout. . . . Robert Rosenfeld, team physician since 1966, died Tuesday 
night of lung cancer at age 80. STEVE SPRINGER

KEEPING TABS / DANA HADDAD: CAL'S UWAEZUOKE STILL FEELS A HUNGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One might wonder what California's football team might be doing today had its 
players stayed healthy. Celebrating a Rose Bowl championship? 
</P>
<P>
 Cal was the only Pacific 10 Conference team to beat both UCLA and Arizona, but 
the Bears also lost to USC, Washington, Washington State and Arizona State in 
succession. 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Iheanyi Uwaezuoke finds a direct correlation between the four 
defeats and three injuries to key players, including quarterback Dave Barr's 
shoulder sprain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always knew the Rose Bowl was definitely something we could achieve this 
year," said Uwaezuoke, who played football at Harvard High (now 
Harvard-Westlake). "But the injuries came at a bad time." 
</P>
<P>
 Uwaezuoke and his Cal teammates can look back at this fractured season with 
satisfaction after they trounced Iowa, 37-3, in the Alamo Bowl on New Year's 
Eve. 
</P>
<P>
 Uwaezuoke, a 6-foot-1, 185-pound sophomore, prefers to say he's happy -- not 
necessarily satisfied. He caught 25 passes this season. He'll tell you he 
should have caught 50. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the kind of person who's always hungry," he said. "I'm never satisfied. 
But pleased to some extent? Yeah." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially after his final reception of 1993, a 34-yard touchdown catch 
against Iowa in the third quarter that put the game out of reach, 31-3. The 
play wasn't designed to go to Uwaezuoke, but when Barr saw him line up 
one-on-one with a cornerback, he called an audible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ran a perfect post route and Dave laid it in perfectly," Uwaezuoke said. 
</P>
<P>
 It hardly mattered that the big catch came in the Alamo Bowl, not the Rose 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just awesome," said Uwaezuoke, 20, who moved to the United States from 
his native Nigeria when he was 7. "I was just overly pumped." 
</P>
<P>
 Uwaezuoke caught two passes for 55 yards in the Alamo Bowl. In the regular 
season, his 25 catches accounted for 422 yards (16.9 per catch) and two 
touchdowns, and ranked him third on the team. The Bears often looked to him in 
big-play situations, but next year they also will use him as a possession 
receiver, Uwaezuoke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal finished 9-4 and was one of three Pac-10 teams to win a bowl game. The 
only team to lose was UCLA. Arizona routed Miami and USC beat Utah. Uwaezuoke 
said the Pac-10's success was not surprising. 
</P>
<P>
 "Comparing the Pac-10 to non-Pac-10 opponents," said Uwaezuoke, "we were 
basically running people over. It's an honor to play in the Pac-10 and be able 
to compete on this level." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Good bowling: Cal fullback Marty Holly (Harvard) closed out his career with 
three pass receptions for 21 yards in the Alamo Bowl, and freshman running back 
Tarik Smith (Oak Park) rushed three times for 13 yards. Uwaezuoke said Smith 
has a bright future with the Bears. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has enormous talent -- all the physical tools," Uwaezuoke said of Smith, 
who figures to play behind sophomore Reynard Rutherford next season. "He's 
still the back of the future. It's just a matter of when he matures." 
</P>
<P>
 Utah fullback Jamal Anderson (El Camino Real) had 128 combined yards in 
rushing (16 carries for 67 yards) and pass receiving (seven catches for 61 
yards in the Utes' 28-21 loss to USC in the Freedom Bowl. Anderson's 34-yard 
touchdown run, on which he broke four tackles, made the score 28-13 in the 
third quarter. Anderson and Cal tackle Todd Steussie (Agoura) will play in the 
East-West Shrine game Jan. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona junior running back Ontiwaun Carter (Kennedy) gained 63 yards in 17 
carries in the Wildcats' 29-0 victory over Miami in the Fiesta Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Checking the fax: In basketball, Oklahoma City guard Kevin Franklin (Taft) has 
been slowed by an ankle injury while averaging 12 points a game. His high for 
the season is 21 against Henderson State. NBA scouts from at least seven teams 
have watched him play this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma junior forward Calvin Curry (Ventura College) is averaging 11.6 
points and 4.2 rebounds through nine games. 
</P>
<P>
 New Orleans senior forward Tony Madison (Antelope Valley College) scored a 
career-high 20 points in a 79-72 victory over Southern last week. DANA HADDAD

ROSS PUSHING HER RECOVERY 'WAY AHEAD OF SCHEDULE'; BASKETBALL: POSITIVE 
ATTITUDE IS KEY TO SPEEDY REHABILITATION BY NEWPORT HARBOR GRADUATE.

 There's a nasty, four-inch scar covering the steel plate in her right ankle 
and a smaller scar on her right wrist, but Michaela Ross hardly looks like a 
woman who suffered serious multiple injuries in an automobile accident only 
three months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors told the former Newport Harbor High School basketball/track standout 
she'd be in a wheelchair at least two months after the Oct. 11 accident, which 
occurred near Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross was out of the wheelchair the first week of November. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross was told she wouldn't be able to walk for three months. 
</P>
<P>
 She was walking Nov. 10 and expects to be running next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross feels good, she's moving around quite well, and she seems every bit as 
effervescent as she was before that October night, when the car in which she 
was a passenger jumped a curb and smashed into a tree. 
</P>
<P>
 "She looks fantastic, considering three months ago she was lying in a bed with 
casts on her feet and tubes all over her," said Shannon Jakosky, Newport Harbor 
girls' basketball coach. "She's obviously way ahead of schedule medically. 
</P>
<P>
 "But she has tremendous internal fortitude and a positive spiritual outlook on 
life. I wouldn't have expected anything less than what's happening, to be 
honest." 
</P>
<P>
 One moment Ross was on her way home from dinner, laughing and talking and 
having a good time with Pomona basketball teammates Tiffany and Taffany Maxwell 
and Lori Talley. The next moment, at least as far as Ross can recall, the Jaws 
of Life were churning through the wreckage in an effort to free her. 
</P>
<P>
 The car Talley was driving had hit a curb sometime after 9 p.m., spun out of 
control and crashed into a tree off Valley Boulevard, south of Temple Avenue in 
Pomona. University officials said no alcohol was involved in the one-car crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Talley suffered a sprained arm and wrist, Tiffany Maxwell's arm was broken in 
six places, and Taffany Maxwell suffered a fractured facial bone below her eye. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ross, who was in the passenger seat, got the worst of it. The right side 
of her body bore the brunt of the collision and her head smashed through the 
windshield. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross, who was knocked unconscious on impact, suffered a partially collapsed 
lung, fractured pelvis, fractured lower vertebrae, broken right wrist and right 
thumb, dislocated and broken right ankle, dislocated and broken toes on her 
right foot, and cuts around her right eye. 
</P>
<P>
 She spent the next few hours drifting in and out of consciousness. Ross 
remembers paramedics at the scene saying her vital signs were low. She 
remembers being put on a stretcher and carried into an ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
 Her next memory is of waking up in the intensive care unit of Pomona Valley 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember feeling pretty good," said Ross, a Times All-Orange County 
selection in basketball and track in 1992-93. "My coaches were there, I was 
laughing. I was obviously pretty drugged up." 
</P>
<P>
 The sight of Ross was pretty sobering for Ross' mother, though. 
</P>
<P>
 When Valarie Ross received "the phone call a parent never wants to get," she 
knew her daughter had suffered serious injuries in the crash, and she had the 
entire drive from her home in Costa Mesa to the Pomona hospital to brace 
herself for what she was about to see. 
</P>
<P>
 But she was still shocked. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I walked in she was just covered in blood," Valarie said. "It was not a 
pretty sight. I took a quick look at her and started crying. Michaela made some 
wisecrack -- I knew she'd do that -- and then the doctors started putting her 
back together." 
</P>
<P>
 Those doctors considered Ross lucky. They told her the seat belt she was 
wearing saved her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first reaction was of grief and sadness -- I thought, 'Why her?' " Jakosky 
said. "As the hours ticked by and I realized the extent of her injuries, I was 
thankful she was alive. That was a severe wreck. She was very lucky."  
</P>
<P>
 Ross was transferred from Pomona Valley Hospital to Hoag Memorial Hospital in 
Newport Beach the day after the crash, and her room soon resembled a Hallmark 
store, as the cards, balloons and flowers began flooding in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each balloon was signed by a different student at Newport Harbor," said Ross. 
"All my friends' mothers came in and brought me candy. My boyfriend came every 
day. The nurses were really friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was real supportive. It made me feel like I can do it, that I'm not 
alone, that it's not going to be as much a struggle as I thought it would be." 
</P>
<P>
 Deep down, though, Ross had her doubts. The first few days of her two-week 
hospital stay, Ross liked the attention. She was under heavy medication and 
didn't feel a lot of pain. But as time wore on and the pain-killers wore off, 
Ross found herself thinking more and more about her plight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I broke down a few times," said Ross. "People, at first, thought I should be 
more emotional, but I didn't feel I needed to be. But after I thought about the 
situation for a while, I got scared. I had faced adversity before, but nothing 
like this." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until Ross returned home that she began to snap out of that negative 
mind set. 
</P>
<P>
 "I began to put things in perspective," Ross said. "I said, 'OK, this is what 
my goals are. I want to play basketball and I want to be an All-American.' I 
wasn't going to do that if I just sat here. I had to think about what I can do, 
not what I can't do." 
</P>
<P>
 That attitude helped expedite the rehabilitation process. Ross attended 
therapy sessions in Irvine three times a week for two months, and each week, it 
seemed her doctor would knock another item off the lists of things Ross 
shouldn't do. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross was able to walk briskly on a treadmill machine two weeks ago and expects 
to be running next week. A 4.0 student in high school, Ross resumed classes 
Monday at Pomona, where she will have a double major in psychology and liberal 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, I feel I'm back to normal," said Ross, who averaged 22 points to 
lead Newport Harbor to the Southern Section III-AA basketball semifinals last 
winter and placed fourth in the high jump at the 1993 State track and field 
championships. "I'll be playing next year. The doctors are all pretty amazed at 
the progress I've shown. I'm pretty amazed, too."

RAMS TO USE THEIR ESCAPE CLAUSE; PRO FOOTBALL: TEAM WILL NOTIFY ANAHEIM TODAY 
OF ITS INTENTION TO EXPLORE OPTION OF MOVING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams will notify the city of Anaheim today via fax that they intend to 
invoke the escape clause in their long-term lease for Anaheim Stadium to 
explore the option of moving. 
</P>
<P>
 The team will not give formal 15-month's notice today, as required by the 
escape clause, but will provide the city with a specific date indicating when 
it will do so. 
</P>
<P>
 While declining to provide the date, sources said the team is not expected to 
give formal notice before April, which would allow enough time to begin play 
elsewhere in the fall of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's notification puts outside bidders and the city of Anaheim on alert, 
while also buying additional time for the Rams above and beyond the required 
15-month's notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Formal notice will not indicate the team has definitely decided to move, but 
will, in effect, make the Rams a free agent without restrictions to accept all 
offers, including a new financial pitch from Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Most speculation has focused on Baltimore as a likely place for the Rams to 
land, but the team has made no commitment to that city at this time. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Baltimore, Memphis and St. Louis lobbied hard for NFL expansion 
franchises recently before losing to Jacksonville and Charlotte. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have prepared a press release that will be made available as soon as 
the team has officially informed the city of its intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 The press release will indicate that the Rams reserve the right, under their 
present lease agreement, to revoke the 15-month notice at any time once it's 
given, and remain in Anaheim.  
</P>
<P>
 The release will indicate the Rams' wish to explore the economic viability of 
remaining in Anaheim, and will suggest that newer designed stadiums provide 
better revenue prospects than Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, who finished 5-11 for a fourth consecutive losing season, averaged 
45,401 fans a home game this season, their lowest total since their arrival at 
Anaheim Stadium in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 John Shaw, Ram executive vice president, said in a recent interview: "Our 
gross receipts are among those at the bottom of the league, and with recent 
expenses and the advent of free agency, I'm just not sure how viable it is 
going to be (to remain in Anaheim)." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Shaw nor other Ram officials were available for comment on today's 
expected action. 
</P>
<P>
 According to The Times' sources, the team will make it clear in today's 
announcement that it will play the 1994 season in Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the problems inherent in becoming a lame duck -- falling attendance, 
interest and revenues -- insiders said the Rams do not intend to act quickly in 
resolving their future. In fact, Ram officials are not expected to make 
themselves immediately available for discussion with competing cities, thereby 
allowing bidders the time to evaluate each other and increase the ante. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Rams give formal 15-month's notice, they will have to immediately pay 
more than $1 million to the city of Anaheim, and will, if they decide to move, 
be obligated to pay off the remaining debt on stadium improvements, which is 
currently estimated at $30 million. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, the Rams pay the city of Anaheim a rental fee of 60 cents per 
admission, not to exceed $400,000. The Rams also pay 7.5% of ticket revenue to 
the city of Anaheim and 20% of their luxury box revenue. The Rams receive 50% 
of all revenue from parking and concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maryland Stadium Authority has said that the city of Baltimore will begin 
construction of a $165-million stadium in the Camden Yard area of downtown as 
soon as it receives a team. A $1 rent per game will be charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore has said it will give a team all ticket revenues, including those 
from luxury boxes, and all revenues from parking and concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore would also provide the new tenant with the old Colts' practice 
facility, but with $4.5 million in renovations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams continue to negotiate with the Magnolia School District regarding 
their present practice facility. The Anaheim City Council, which acts as 
Magnolia's negotiator, meets next Wednesday night to decide if it will extend 
the Rams' practice facility lease 15 years, while also providing a two-year 
escape clause. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams pay $120,000 a year for the use of the Magnolia site, and claim the 
city has reneged on its $7-million promise to purchase or provide an upgraded 
facility. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rams sign a letter of intent with another city to move, they will 
probably have to sue the NFL at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 NFL guidelines require teams to win approval from three-fourths of the 
league's owners before granting a team's request to transfer. If the Rams 
wished to move, they would be required to submit a "statement of reasons" and 
then the league would conduct an investigation and offer a recommendation to 
its ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rams subject themselves to such formal procedures, they risk receiving 
a negative response. As protection, they would file suit before beginning the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal problems of a move such as this was typified by the Raiders' long 
battle, in conjunction with the Los Angeles Coliseum Commission, to get the NFL 
to allow their move to Southern California. The Raiders' victory came at the 
expense of years of complicated courtroom drama. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia Frontiere, owner of the Rams, said in a recent interview that she 
would like to do anything she could to avoid becoming party to litigation. 
Insiders said this might be the single biggest reason why the Rams would 
ultimately decide to stay where they are. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial incentives for moving, though, are expected to increase in the 
coming months, as cities woo the Rams. Ram insiders do not expect the city of 
Anaheim to keep pace with outside bidders. 
</P>
<P>
 Frontiere has said she will not sell the team, but she said she has been urged 
strongly by Shaw, her financial adviser, to consider moving. 
</P>
<P>
 Frontiere was married to Carroll Rosenbloom during his tenure as owner of the 
Baltimore Colts. Rosenbloom, owner of the team when it won Super Bowl V on Jan. 
17, 1971, traded the Colts to Robert Irsay in 1972 for ownership of the Rams. 
Irsay had purchased the Rams from the estate of Dan Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, a year before he died and willed the team to his widow, Georgia, 
Rosenbloom grew weary of the parking problems, deteriorating conditions and 
lack of luxury boxes in the Coliseum. On Nov. 21, 1978, five months before his 
death, he signed a 35-year lease with the city of Anaheim, after being promised 
luxury suites, an expanded stadium and a land deal that would allow the 
Rosenbloom heirs to develop an office complex in the parking lot of the 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The office tower remains unbuilt and a source of aggravation to the Rams. The 
Angels sued the city in 1983 to prevent the construction of the building, and 
issue is pending in court. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim City Council, reacting to rumors that the Rams might move, has met 
twice to discuss the situation. Council members have been eager to pledge their 
support of the Rams, but have suggested that the city is in no position to 
compete with outside bidders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want the Rams here, but I'll be damned if I'll vote to give them half the 
city," Councilman Irv Pickler said earlier. "I won't beg them to stay." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they have made changes in the lease five times since 1978 
to accommodate the Rams. The last change came in 1990, and today returns to 
haunt the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams objected to the construction of the new Anaheim Arena and threatened 
to hold up construction with the request for an environmental impact survey. 
The Rams, however, agreed to drop such a request in 1990, in exchange for an 
escape clause in their Anaheim Stadium lease, which was to expire in 2015. 
</P>
<P>
 The city agreed, although an attempt was made later, the Rams said, to renege 
on the deal. The Rams threatened to go to court and the city honored its 
promise, provided the escape clause and began construction of the Arena.

KICKING HIS WAY TO STARDOM; RAIDERS' JAEGER IS EARNING A PLACE AMONG NFL'S 
ELITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The crowd was screaming. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders were driving. 
</P>
<P>
 And on the sideline, Jeff Jaeger was thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 Thinking about which hash mark he'd like to kick from, which yard line he'd 
ideally like to set up on, which way the wind was blowing. 
</P>
<P>
 Thinking about the advantages of kicking into the closed end of the Coliseum 
where the Raiders were headed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was overtime last Sunday and the Raiders, needing a victory to advance to 
the playoffs, were tied with the Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaeger got his wish in terms of the end he was facing, the hash mark, the yard 
line and the angle into the wind. 
</P>
<P>
 And he responded with a 47-yard field goal that gave the Raiders a 33-30 
victory and lifted them into postseason play. 
</P>
<P>
 But did all that thinking really matter? There was hardly a breeze late Sunday 
at the Coliseum. And Jaeger has kicked into the other end, from longer 
distances and from the other hash mark. 
</P>
<P>
 So aren't all those elements more of a factor in the mind than on the field? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," Jaeger conceded, "if you put a good swing on the ball, unless there's 
a hurricane, you're going to make it. But by thinking about (all the other 
factors), it takes the nerves away." 
</P>
<P>
 Nerves? Jaeger? 
</P>
<P>
 If ever a kicker had a right to exude self-confidence, it is Jaeger. In his 
seventh NFL season and his fifth with the Raiders, Jaeger, 29, has had 
unprecedented success. He has kicked 35 field goals to tie the all-time NFL 
record. He has scored 132 points to lead the NFL and set a Raider record. He 
kicked four field goals in a game three times. And he made 11 field-goal 
attempts in a row at one point. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is a position where confidence must be renewed on every snap. If a 
lineman misses a block, it may not be noticed by the average fan. If a receiver 
drops a ball, he's usually going to get a chance to redeem himself on the next 
play or soon after. 
</P>
<P>
 The kicker, however, is out there alone in the spotlight for better or worse. 
If he misses, he may not get a chance at redemption for another week. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not as good as your last kick," said Steve Ortmayer, the special teams 
coach. "You're as good as your next kick." 
</P>
<P>
 Even in this year of years for Jaeger, there was a low moment. In a 16-10 loss 
to the Cincinnati Bengals, he missed four field-goal attempts. All the kicks 
veered to the left, but not by much. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaeger took it hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was down," he said. "Who wouldn't be? I just told myself, 'Heck, I've been 
around long enough and I am a good kicker.' I did not change anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "That thought is there, and I've done that before when I haven't been kicking 
well. But I think you just dig yourself a deeper hole. That has been the case 
for me. I've learned not to mess around." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does Jaeger ever want the Raiders to mess around with his two partners in 
the kicking game, long snapper Dan Turk and holder Jeff Gossett. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't overemphasize how much Jeff (Jaeger) depends on those two," Ortmayer 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jaeger: "Danny puts it there every time with a little extra zip on it 
that allows me a fraction of a second longer. And Jeff always gets it down with 
the laces right." 
</P>
<P>
 With all his success this season, however, Jaeger did not make the Pro Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ludicrous," Ortmayer said. "But with the fans now involved, who knows 
where the votes came from." 
</P>
<P>
 Jaeger admits he was disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was frustrating," he said. "That's what everybody points toward. The 
recognition. Everybody wants that. But you've got to get over it. What good 
does it do to sit and pout about it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ortmayer is outraged because he feels Jaeger's talent goes beyond field-goal 
kicking. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is one of the best in the league at kickoffs as well," Ortmayer said. "A 
lot of guys can kick field goals, but there aren't very many who can also kick 
off like that. That's really important to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Another area that sometimes gets overlooked is the extra point. 
</P>
<P>
 Take last Sunday for example. Jeff Hostetler connected with Alexander Wright 
on a four-yard touchdown pass on the final play of regulation, pulling the 
Raiders even with the Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 But not really. 
</P>
<P>
 The score was 30-29 with the conversion kick still to come. While the Coliseum 
crowd was busy celebrating, Jaeger knew the season would be lost unless he 
converted the kick. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a gimmee," Jaeger said. "I'm telling them, 'OK, everybody pay 
attention. Nobody jump offside. Nobody hold.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody did and Jaeger made the kick, making it look easy. But it never is, 
even for the best of kickers.

METS UNLOAD COLEMAN IN TRADE WITH ROYALS; BASEBALL: NEW YORK GETS MCREYNOLDS 
FOR THE CONTROVERSIAL OUTFIELDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The New York Mets made good Wednesday on their commitment to unload Vince 
Coleman. The surprising part was that they weren't forced to release him and 
swallow the final year of his contract. They actually got a player in return, 
the Kansas City Royals agreeing to ship Kevin McReynolds back to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got value where there was no value," Met General Manager Joe McIlvaine 
said. "The owner had made it clear Coleman wasn't going to play for us again. 
Most teams were waiting in the weeds to see if we would be forced to release 
him so they could sign him for the minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think we would be able to trade him, but I think it's a trade that 
will benefit both players. McReynolds had his best years with the Mets. I feel 
fortunate to have been able to add a quality player." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mets will pick up $500,000 of Coleman's $3-million salary next season and 
pay McReynolds $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman's troubled tenure with the Mets basically ended on July 24. He was in 
the process of leaving the players' parking lot at Dodger Stadium in a car 
driven by Eric Davis when Coleman threw an M-100 explosive device that injured 
three people, including a 2-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 The 32-year-old outfielder eventually pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge 
of possession of an explosive device. He was given a one-year suspended jail 
term and three years probation. He was fined $1,000 and ordered to perform 200 
hours of community service. He faces two civil suits and has said he would make 
restitution to the injured parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't condone what Coleman did, but we don't really feel he's a bad 
person," Kansas City General Manager Herk Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did a lot of homework, talking to ex-players, managers and general 
managers. George Brett (a Royal vice president) and I talked to Vince for three 
hours today before the trade was finalized. He recognizes that what he did was 
stupid and is genuinely sorry about it and highly motivated to resume his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been working with (fitness expert) Mack Newton for six months or more 
and is in outstanding shape. We felt we had to improve our offense and acquire 
an established leadoff hitter with Coleman's type (of) speed. We had a lot of 
innings in which we had three hits and didn't score a run." 
</P>
<P>
 After two injury-marred seasons with the Mets, Coleman was hitting .279 with 
38 stolen bases in 51 attempts when the incident in Los Angeles ended his 
season. During his time with the Mets, he also had physical confrontations with 
coach Mike Cubbage and then-manager Jeff Torborg and cost Dwight Gooden a start 
when he hit the pitcher in the shoulder while swinging a golf club in the 
clubhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "It turned out to be an ill-fated investment," McIlvaine said of the Mets' 
$11.95-million signing of Coleman, "but he still has the potential to be a 
quality player." 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman apologized again Wednesday for the incident in Los Angeles, saying he 
was happy to have resolved his career uncertainty and predicting he is capable 
of stealing 100 or more bases. 
</P>
<P>
 McReynolds, 34, was traded from the Mets to the Royals in December of 1991 as 
part of a five-player deal that sent Bret Saberhagen to New York. McReynolds 
hit .245 with 11 homers last season and was benched at one point for what 
Manager Hal McRae said was a lack of hustle. 
</P>
<P>
 In the rebuilding of the Mets from their 103 losses of 1993, McReynolds or Joe 
Orsulak is expected to share the outfield with two young players -- Jeromy 
Burnitz and Ryan Thompson. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you were posting a sign on the Mets," McIlvaine said, "it would still 
read, 'under construction.' "

JIM MURRAY: WINNING IS HIS MIDDLE NAME AGAIN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On a sunny Sunday in April of 1987, on a golf course in Augusta, Ga., a 
terrible thing happened to golfer Larry Mize. 
</P>
<P>
 Got struck by lightning? Well, in a way, yes. 
</P>
<P>
 He won the Masters. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not an accident. But maybe a mistake. On the second playoff hole, Larry 
Mize had missed the green to the right with his second shot. His opponent, Greg 
Norman, was sitting on the fringe with a birdie shot at the hole. Mize was 140 
feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 He was really trying to chip it close when it trickled across the green and 
into the hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Greatly to his surprise, to say nothing of the rest of the golf world, he had 
won the 51st Masters, gone to join such legends of the game as Hogan, Snead, 
Nelson, Nicklaus, Palmer, Player, Watson and Sarazen. And he had just defeated 
in the playoff Seve Ballesteros and Greg Norman, no less. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, some players strive all their lives to win a Masters. And, as an 
Augusta-born boy, Larry Mize's elation was epic. 
</P>
<P>
 But he had just let a 500-pound gorilla into his life. 
</P>
<P>
 Lots of things are too little too late, but for Larry Mize, this was too much 
too soon. 
</P>
<P>
 He had won only one other tournament in his life up to that point. And, he was 
not to win another for six years. 
</P>
<P>
 As Larry Mize, he was free to play his game on tour, which was to play the 
percentage shot, keep the ball in play, learn his craft painstakingly. As 
Masters winner Larry Mize, he was expected to play like a star. He had to go 
for it. No layup for a Masters winner. No lag putts. No protecting yourself on 
the money list. I mean, would Babe Ruth bunt? Red Grange run out of bounds? 
</P>
<P>
 Would Arnold Palmer lay up? 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Mize was only 28 when he won the Masters. He had been steadily 
successful on tour, improving annually. Until the Masters. He had won the 1983 
Danny Thomas tournament at Memphis. That was nice but not historic. That didn't 
interrupt the learning process so important to golf. 
</P>
<P>
 His game basically was not overpowering, it was straight. Mize kept the ball 
in play. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, he had new responsibilities. He had won a major. When he got up on a 
tee, the announcer trumpeted "And, now . . . Masters winner! Larry Mize!" 
</P>
<P>
 Big things were expected. Mize could not play his own careful, sensible game. 
He could not take what the course gave him. He had to shoot for its jugular. 
</P>
<P>
 There were other distractions. It has become commonplace in golf for champions 
to be whisked off for public appearances, corporate outings and other sideshows 
until their games disintegrate. Note how many people win a U.S. Open -- then 
disappear from leader boards forever. 
</P>
<P>
 This was not precisely Larry Mize's trouble. He did not let his game atrophy 
playing company treasurers on non-challenging tracks. Larry Mize put the 
pressure on Larry Mize. 
</P>
<P>
 "I shouldn't have tried to hit the ball farther -- but I did," he was 
recalling as he underwent treatment for a stiff neck at the Mercedes 
Championships at the La Costa Resort and Spa this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden, I didn't have the patience I used to have. I'm not a 
long-ball hitter. I hit it far enough, but basically I try to keep it out of 
trouble, set up the next shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started expecting things of myself that were maybe a little bit beyond my 
capabilities." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, he tried to become a combination of John Daly and Jack 
Nicklaus. 
</P>
<P>
 Golf is a game that doesn't lend itself to daring. It is a game of control. It 
requires an understanding of yourself. Larry Mize began playing somebody else's 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Mize's game had been that he didn't miss cuts. He made the top 60 in 
tournaments he entered. He made sure of it. Suddenly, he began to miss cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Masters champions don't miss cuts. So, gradually, Mize began to fade back in 
the crowd. The pressure decreased as the publicity decreased. The gallery 
expected less of him. So Mize expected less of him. 
</P>
<P>
 He put the experience to good use. "I began to understand the player that I 
am. I know my strengths. So I know my weaknesses, too. After the Masters, I 
didn't play my game. I play my game now." 
</P>
<P>
 The moral of the story is, a man should not really win a major until he's 
ready for it. Ben Hogan didn't win an Open till he was 36 years old. Then, he 
won four in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Mize's Masters victory was not a fluke. He had played solid under-par 
golf all week. He had won $314,051 the year before, 17th on the money list. 
</P>
<P>
 As Masters champion, he dwindled to 62nd and 47th on the money list 
consecutively. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't remake his play; he remade the player. Larry Mize turned back into 
Larry Mize. He still went for the pin -- but not if he had to hit it over the 
Empire State Building (or its equivalent) to get there. He didn't turn back 
into a pumpkin. But he didn't try to be Superman or John Daly, either. 
</P>
<P>
 He put the green coat back in the closet. He began to play the cards he was 
dealt. He made cuts. And in 1993, for the first time in six years, he won 
tournaments. He won at Tucson in January, the Buick Open in August. He was 13th 
on the money list, 13th in scoring average. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he drew into the world's richest (for the winner) tournament, the Johnny 
Walker at Montego Bay, Jamaica. He won like Secretariat -- by 10 shots. Fred 
Couples had to shoot a last-day 64 to get that close. 
</P>
<P>
 The old Larry Mize won $550,000 for that one. The money was unofficial but 
cashable. With the $724,659 he won officially, it gave him a million-dollar 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The object in golf is, be yourself. The courses, the clubs, the balls don't 
respond to impostors. When you try to cut a dogleg you should shoot around, the 
course lets you know it is not impressed. It resents your putting on airs. It 
has an attitude: "That may be the Masters champion to you, buster, but it looks 
like Larry Mize to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it's well to remember that Larry Mize won the Masters as Larry 
Mize. Now that he has reverted to type, he might do it again. The course at 
Augusta might react: "Uh-oh, I remember this guy. Where has he been?" 
</P>
<P>
 Where he has been is trying to live up to his middle name, which is "Hogan."

STOKES TO STAY AT UCLA AFTER CONSIDERING MOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A day after losing its top defensive player, linebacker Jamir Miller, who is 
leaving school to make himself available for the NFL draft, UCLA learned that 
its No. 1 offensive threat, J.J. Stokes, would be back for his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes, who set Bruin receiving records with 82 catches for 1,181 yards and 17 
touchdowns, told Coach Terry Donahue on Wednesday that he had decided to stay 
in school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has never been a question in my mind that I would be staying at UCLA," 
said Stokes, though he had said earlier in the day that he had not made a 
decision regarding the issue. "I am looking forward to playing another year of 
college football and helping us get back to the Rose Bowl. A lot of people said 
I should leave, but I have to do what I want to do and I want to stay at UCLA." 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes had said at midseason that his parents wanted him to complete his 
education before going on to pro football. But in the weeks between the regular 
season and the Rose Bowl, time in which he was chosen as an All-American and 
was under pressure from agents to turn pro, he said that he was pondering the 
move, but had not made up his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really didn't think he was going to go," said quarterback Wayne Cook, who 
threw 15 of his 18 touchdown passes to Stokes. "After the Rose Bowl, he told 
me, 'We'll be back here next year and win this thing,' so I kind of figured he 
was staying. But it's good news to hear he has decided." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA lost to Wisconsin, 21-16, in the Rose Bowl game. Stokes set Rose Bowl 
records with 14 catches for 176 yards, giving him the top three games in Bruin 
history for receiving yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes' continued presence at UCLA was welcomed by Donahue. "I have said all 
year that he is an impact player, and he certainly has to be considered one of 
the top offensive players in the nation next year," he said.

TEXAS A&M BANNED FROM BOWL AND TV FOR ONE YEAR; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: NCAA PENALTY 
IS LIGHTER THAN ONE PAC-10 IMPOSED ON WASHINGTON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The NCAA sent a stern message Wednesday to one of its oft-troubled members, 
Texas A&M, taking the unusual step of placing the school on probation for five 
years as a result of rules violations involving the Aggies' football program.  
</P>
<P>
 Only two other schools -- Southeastern Louisiana and Upsala College -- have 
received probationary periods of a similar duration from the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the lengthy probation, Texas A&M was given relatively light sanctions 
by the NCAA Committee on Infractions, which issued its ruling after a yearlong 
investigation by the NCAA enforcement staff and university officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aggie football team was barred from playing in a bowl game or appearing on 
television during the 1994 season. However, Texas A&M was spared other 
sanctions, such as cuts in scholarships and recruiting visits. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas A&M players were found to have benefited from a scheme in which a 
booster arranged jobs requiring little or no work. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar scheme was a central element of the Pacific 10 Conference's case 
against Washington last year. That case resulted in a ruling by the conference 
in which the Huskies were barred from bowl appearances for two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aggies, Southwest Conference champions the last three years, finished the 
1993 season 10-2 after a 24-21 loss to Notre Dame in the Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at a news conference in College Station, Tex., E. Dean Gage, the 
university's interim president, said: "This issue is a single, isolated case, 
and we regret that this incident will impact negatively thousands . . . who 
were in no way involved and who are totally committed and supportive of the 
university's compliance and institutional control." 
</P>
<P>
 Texas A&M Coach R.C. Slocum told reporters he was pleased to have the matter 
resolved because of the recruiting implications. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have to hear all the wild speculation and innuendo," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine Aggie players, including star tailback Greg Hill, were found to have 
received nearly $18,000 in unearned wages from 1990-92 as a result of their 
employment at apartment complexes operated by Warren A. Gilbert Jr., a Dallas 
developer. Gilbert was president of the university's athletic support group -- 
the 12th Man Foundation -- at the time the infractions occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA also found that the university showed a lack of institutional control 
over its football program by failing to monitor appropriately its jobs program 
for athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling marks the seventh time that Texas A&M has received public sanctions 
because of athletic rules violations -- a factor in the Committee on 
Infractions' decision to impose such a lengthy probationary period. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA placed the Aggie football program on two years probation in 1988 for 
infractions that occurred during the coaching tenure of Jackie Sherrill, who 
was later forced to resign.  
</P>
<P>
 Texas A&M could have received the NCAA's so-called "death penalty" for repeat 
violators, and, according to the Committee on Infractions' report, the panel 
gave serious consideration to applying such a sanction. However, the committee 
backed off because of several factors, including the relatively limited scope 
of the infractions and the university's attempt to investigate fully.

FREY AGREES TO CONTRACT WITH GIANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Frey, the left-handed relief pitcher who led the Angels with 13 saves 
last season, reached an agreement Wednesday with the San Francisco Giants on a 
two-year contract worth $1.85 million. The Angels had offered $1.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried, we tried our best to work out something with the Angels," Frey 
said, "but nothing ever happened. I wanted to go to the Angels all along, but 
they just never budged. It's a shame, but they really left me no choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angel General Manager Whitey Herzog: "We made a good offer to him, and we 
hate to lose him, but we'll be all right." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels will attempt to replace Frey in the bullpen by picking up a veteran 
free agent, possibly Bob Patterson (formerly of Texas) or Bob MacDonald 
(formerly of Detroit). The Angels also are expected to enter the season with 
one of their own young lefties in the bullpen, choosing between Mark Holzemer 
and Hilly Hathaway. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, interest in free-agent reliever Gregg Olson has intensified since 
Dr. James Andrews said no surgery will be needed on Olson's right elbow. The 
Atlanta Braves, Philadelphia Phillies and Toronto Blue Jays have joined the 
Angels and Baltimore Orioles in their quest of Olson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are scheduled to make offers to starting pitcher Mike Harkey today 
and to Olson on Friday. BOB NIGHTENGALE

FRACTURED HAND PUTS STATUS OF CSUN'S CHEVALIER IN DOUBT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Andre Chevalier, the Cal State Northridge basketball team's senior floor 
leader, has a broken bone in his right hand, X-rays revealed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevalier, a 6-foot point guard, is averaging 12.9 points and leads the 
Matadors with 61 assists and 25 steals.His status for Saturday's game against 
UC Irvine, the first of seven consecutive road games for Northridge, is 
questionable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not bad, but it is fractured," Chevalier said after being examined by 
Dr. Eric Slatten, Northridge team physician. "The doctor said to ice it. I'll 
just have to play with the pain if I can. Hopefully, by Saturday, (the swelling 
will) be back down." 
</P>
<P>
 The pain was intense enough Tuesday night that Chevalier asked to be removed 
from Northridge's home game against Buffalo at a key juncture. The Matadors 
were clinging to a four-point lead with five minutes to play when Chevalier 
banged his hand against the elbow of Buffalo guard Modie Cox. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevalier attempted to shake off the pain, believing he simply had aggravated 
an injury incurred last Thursday during practice. 
</P>
<P>
 But when he found it difficult to dribble the ball, he asked to be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Overcoming adversity is nothing new for Chevalier. He was born with only two 
fingers on his left hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Hill, a sophomore from North Hollywood High, is Chevalier's understudy 
at point guard. Hill occasionally has been maligned for his ballhandling and 
floor leadership, but he played well against Buffalo, making a key three-point 
basket and igniting the transition game as Northridge pulled away to win, 
90-72. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevalier will determine his own playing status. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this situation it's up to you as an individual and the kind of pain you 
can endure," Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy said. "That has to be his call."

BOITANO NOT SUCH A SURE BET AFTER ALL; FIGURE SKATING: FORMER OLYMPIC CHAMPION 
IS LEADER AFTER TECHNICAL PROGRAM, BUT JUDGES DO NOT OVERWHELMINGLY ENDORSE 
HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A headline in one of the local newspapers Wednesday asked, "Who's No. 2?" 
</P>
<P>
 The assumption was that 1988 Olympic gold medalist Brian Boitano would glide 
to his fifth U.S. figure skating championship and that the other contenders 
would compete for the second U.S. men's berth in next month's Winter Olympics 
in Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 But after Wednesday night's technical program at Joe Louis Arena, the answer 
to the newspaper's question could be Boitano. 
</P>
<P>
 He has the lead entering tonight's freestyle program, which accounts for 
two-thirds of the final score, but the judges did not overwhelmingly endorse 
him. Five gave the advantage to Boitano, three to defending national champion 
Scott Davis and one to two-time national champion Todd Eldredge. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, Mark Mitchell, considered a contender after his fourth-place finish 
in last year's World Championships, fell early on a required element and was 
placed sixth, all but ending his Olympic chances. 
</P>
<P>
 Boitano, 30, has said from the time he announced his comeback last year that 
he would have to earn the national title, but almost no one thought that would 
be a challenge for him considering his edge in experience. 
</P>
<P>
 But, before a crowd of 4,367 Wednesday night, he was nervous, which showed 
with his shaky landing on his first jump, a triple lutz. Skating to music from 
"Carousel," he settled down after that and performed without a significant 
error for the remainder of his 2-minute 40-second program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really proud of myself," said Boitano, of Sunnyvale, Calif., who has 
been skating professionally since winning gold medals at the Olympics and World 
Championships in 1988. "The pressure is so much more than when I was an amateur 
before, the pressure of people expecting a lot from you. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the self-confidence I can do it again. But confidence is a fleeting 
thing. You have to keep proving things to yourself. If you won a competition 
five weeks ago, it's not enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always a doubt in your mind. You're very confident and very good 
under pressure, but a voice inside you says, 'There's always a first time. This 
might not be your night.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, 21, might also have heard voices if they had only had more time to 
speak to him. With the order of the 18 competitors determined by a blind draw, 
he skated second. 
</P>
<P>
 "Skating early really helped me," said the son of a high school football coach 
from Great Falls, Mont. "I was more nervous when Brian and Todd skated than 
when I skated." 
</P>
<P>
 But skating early might also have hurt Davis with judges who tend to reserve 
better scores for later performers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps element for element, Scott's spins were better (than Boitano's) in 
some instances," said Davis' coach, Kathy Casey. "But I think the judges judged 
it as they saw it. They obviously saw some things better in Brian's program." 
</P>
<P>
 For the 22-year-old Eldredge, a two-time national champion from Chatham, 
Mass., who slumped to sixth place last year, his technical program was a 
declaration that he is back among the nation's elite. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, we've got what we were shooting for when we came into the 
competition, to be in the running," he said. "I've struggled with the thought 
for a while, after placing sixth last year, that I might not be back in 
contention for a national title." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Renee Roca and partner Gorsha Sur, a Russian defector, are considered 
the United States' No. 1 ice dance team, they discovered last month that they 
will not be eligible for the Olympics because he has not received his 
citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on Wednesday, she suffered a broken left wrist in a collision with 
another dance team during a practice session. 
</P>
<P>
 But a little more than two hours later, after the wrist was set and she was 
fitted for a cast at a local hospital, Roca returned to Joe Louis Arena to 
compete in the second phase of the competition, the original dance. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was like a china doll," Sur said. "I was afraid to touch her." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she and Sur finished second, which is also where the Colorado Springs, 
Colo., team will stand overall entering Friday's free dance if they remain in 
the competition. Elizabeth Punsalan and Jerod Swallow of Bloomfield Hills, 
Mich., are leading in the competition for the only Olympic berth available to 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to get through today and see how I feel tomorrow before I make a 
decision," said Roca, who had been given a shot of Novocain at the hospital to 
kill the pain. "I think I'm in a nightmare right now."

STILL SWINGING; NICKLAUS' SHOULDER FEELS BETTER, SO HE MAKES RARE START AT LA 
COSTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 It was only about six months ago that Jack Nicklaus was seriously considering 
retiring. His right shoulder hurt so much he couldn't lift his arm. He thought 
he had a rotator cuff problem. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he went to the U.S. Senior Open last July, he didn't have much 
hope of continuing golf. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought if I didn't play well, I probably wouldn't play anymore -- maybe 
ever," Nicklaus said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklaus not only played well at Cherry Hills, he won, his first tournament 
victory in more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, two weeks from his 54th birthday, he's expanding his schedule. For the 
first time in nine years, he's playing in the PGA Tour's season opener, the 
Mercedes Championships, formerly known as the Tournament of Champions. 
</P>
<P>
 The 72-hole, $1.5-million competition, in which both senior and regular tour 
golfers play simultaneously for separate titles, starts today at La Costa 
Resort and Spa. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I continue to feel as well as I do right now, I will play a couple of more 
senior events," Nicklaus said. "I also may stay out here after Pebble Beach and 
play in the L.A. Open." 
</P>
<P>
 At La Costa, only tournament champions qualify -- 25 from the regular tour and 
19 from the seniors are entered. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Geiberger has won the last two senior titles at La Costa. Other seniors 
entered include Raymond Floyd, Lee Trevino, Dave Stockton, Bob Charles and 
George Archer. 
</P>
<P>
 The regular tour players entered include defending champion Davis Love III, 
Greg Norman and Fred Couples. Last year's top PGA money winner, Nick Price, 
ailing Paul Azinger and Masters champion Bernhard Langer did not enter. 
</P>
<P>
 First prize for the regular tour players is $180,000. For the seniors, it's 
$100,000. The only concession to the seniors is a course 207 yards shorter. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklaus said he was pleasantly surprised by La Costa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen it in such great condition," he said. "The whole place looks 
different. But in my practice round (Tuesday), I birdied the last two holes." 
</P>
<P>
 More than the birdies gave Nicklaus reason for optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 "For 10 years, I was having trouble with my driver," he said. "Two weeks ago, 
Jim Flick and Rick Smith worked with me on my swing. I played with Greg Norman 
yesterday and I was hitting my drives as far as he did. Until my two teachers 
got me to flatten my swing, he was outdriving me 40 yards." 
</P>
<P>
 A series of stretching exercises has improved the shoulder. "It only hurts 
when I make a bad shot," Nicklaus said.

MAGALLANES MADE WAVES ON FRIGID EASTERN FIELDS; FOOTBALL: HE LEFT HIS SURFBOARD 
IN THOUSAND OAKS FOR GRINDING PHILADELPHIA WINTERS. HE'LL RETURN WITH A COLLEGE 
DEGREE AND ALL-IVY LEAGUE RECOGNITION AS A HARD-HITTING DEFENSIVE BACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's mid-December and downtown Philadelphia doesn't look very inviting to Jim 
Magallanes. Dull gray sky, temperature about 28 degrees -- perfect weather to 
stay inside and study. 
</P>
<P>
 At times like this, Magallanes -- Pennsylvania's All-Ivy League defensive back 
-- daydreams about the Southern California surf. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no waves in Philly. The people are different. And, of course, so is 
the weather. 
</P>
<P>
 Many times over the past four years, Magallanes has wondered whether he picked 
the right college. But his contemplation always led to the same answer:  
</P>
<P>
 Yes. 
</P>
<P>
 "People from all around the country come here," he said. "It's not just all 
California people. But I'm from the East Coast. I was born in Virginia. I moved 
to California when I was 3. I wanted to come back and experience it. 
</P>
<P>
 "On days like this, though, you just want to stay inside." 
</P>
<P>
 When he arrived at Penn his freshman year, many of Magallanes' blazer-and-tie 
classmates told him his appearance was unbecoming an Ivy Leaguer. His long 
black hair cascaded down to the middle of his back. 
</P>
<P>
 They called him "Surfer Boy" and "Native American" -- nicknames Magallanes 
could hardly dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a trace of Native American in his ancestry. And he was quite the surfer 
boy at Thousand Oaks High, departing at lunch five days a week when a good 
swell was hitting Zuma Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Magallanes: "I had two sets of friends (at Thousand Oaks) -- my athlete 
friends and my surfer friends." 
</P>
<P>
 If decorum were a problem at Penn, the coaches weren't concerned. In fact, 
they changed tradition to accommodate the 5-foot-10, 190-pound long-haired kid 
from California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year, the older players make the incoming sophomores shave their 
heads," Magallanes said. "I went to the coaches and said, 'Listen. They're not 
going to cut my hair.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Said Penn Coach Al Bagnoli, who arrived a year after the incident: "Everything 
I hear is secondary, but I heard there was discussion about Jim's hair. But 
since I've been here, he's fit in -- and he's had some terrific games." 
</P>
<P>
 The Quakers let Magallanes keep his hair (he wears a ponytail during games) 
and he won the job as nickel back in 1991. He had 23 tackles that season, four 
of them sacks. His biggest game came in a victory over Brown in which he had 
five tackles, two sacks and a fumble recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving to strong safety in 1992, Magallanes became one of the busiest 
secondary men in the league with 83 tackles -- second-highest on the team. He 
had 15-tackle games against Yale and Dartmouth. He added two pass deflections 
and an interception in the Dartmouth game. 
</P>
<P>
 But his calling card is the shot he gave receiver Michael Lerch in the 
Princeton game that season. It caught the attention of ESPN, which highlighted 
Magallanes in its "Hit of the Week" feature. Lerch had just made a reception 
over the middle when Magallanes nearly knocked him out of his shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was playing a deep zone and I timed it pretty good," Magallanes said. "I 
hit him right under the chin." 
</P>
<P>
 But 1993 was a watershed year for Magallanes and Penn. The Quakers finished 
10-0, defeated Ivy League opponents by an average score of 29-11 and placed 
eight players on the all-league first team. Magallanes, who had 67 tackles, two 
interceptions and forced two fumbles, was one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the consummate secondary guy you're looking for," Bagnoli said. "He 
started out for us as a cornerback, a coverage guy -- a good athlete. When we 
moved him to strong safety, he became a hitter but he still had the coverage 
mentality. He was very versatile that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in what figures to be the most interesting football game of his career, 
Magallanes will accompany the rest of the first-team seniors to Tokyo. There he 
will face the Japanese national team in the Epson-Ivy Bowl on Saturday. 
Magallanes hasn't received any scouting reports about his opponents but he 
anticipates a big game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know nothing about them," he said. "Nobody's told me about their size or 
anything. But I think we'll dominate. I just want to go out with a bang. I want 
some good hits. I love good hits." 
</P>
<P>
 Good hits were Magallanes' trademark in high school, especially during a 
senior season when he was named All-Valley and All-Southern Section. He helped 
Thousand Oaks advance to the Division II semifinals before losing to Muir in 
overtime, 10-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford and UCLA expressed interest in him but eventually backed off. In the 
end, Magallanes had two options: Cal Poly San Luis Obispo or Penn. He decided 
on Penn for several reasons: its academic reputation, the fact that former 
Thousand Oaks free safety Matt Young played there and to be a part of a program 
that started in 1876. 
</P>
<P>
 He participated in an historic moment at Franklin Field in the 
100th-anniversary game against Cornell, a season-ending 17-14 Quaker victory 
that capped a perfect season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice that I've got to experience all this," he said. "But I'm really 
exhausted." 
</P>
<P>
 Magallanes has had to budget his time. Penn does not give scholarships, so he 
was forced to squeeze a part-time job into a schedule that included football 
and a heavy academic load. During the fall, he left practice at 6 p.m., worked 
until 8 then studied from 10 p.m. to 3 a.m. At 9:30 the next morning, he was up 
and headed to class. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to discipline yourself, but it's worth it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Magallanes, a mechanical engineering major, will complete his undergraduate 
work in four years. He recently took final exams in the following courses: 
Advanced Strength of Materials, Thermal Design, Senior Design Project, Senior 
Engineering Lab and Chemistry Lab. 
</P>
<P>
 Slated for his final semester are Electrical Engineering -- Systems and 
Circuits, Finite Elements, Energy Engineering, Senior Lab and Senior Design 
Project. 
</P>
<P>
 His final month at Penn also should be memorable. He and the eight other 
members of his Senior Design Project class will have designed, assembled and 
raced a solar-powered automobile by then. And he will receive his Ivy League 
championship ring and get his diploma. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it's back to Southern California to find a job. But first he might do 
some surfing.

THREE AREA FOOTBALL PLAYERS NAMED TO ALL-SOUTHERN SECTION TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three South Bay players -- Peninsula High offensive lineman John Welbourn, 
Mira Costa defensive lineman Phil Fonua and Hawthorne defensive back Omarr 
Morgan -- have been selected to the elite All-Southern Section football team. 
</P>
<P>
 The 25-player team, chosen by members of the media, represents the best talent 
in the section's 11 divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Others named to the squad included record-setting quarterback Keith Smith of 
Division III champion Newbury Park, highly regarded tight end Tony Gonzalez of 
Division II runner-up Huntington Beach and quarterback Glenn Thompkins of 
Division I champion Eisenhower, winner of The Times' Glenn Davis award as the 
top player in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Welbourn and Morgan were winners of The Times' South Bay lineman and back of 
the year awards. Welbourn, a 6-foot-6, 275-pound senior, was a two-way lineman 
whose blocking helped Peninsula rush for more than 300 yards a game. Morgan 
excelled at free safety for Division III runner-up Hawthorne, finishing with 
150 tackles and seven interceptions. The senior also scored 15 touchdowns as a 
running back, receiver and return specialist. 
</P>
<P>
 Fonua, a 6-2, 265-pound junior, helped Mira Costa win its first Southern 
Section football title with his play at nose tackle and fullback. He led the 
Mustangs with 18 sacks and 19 touchdowns and was named Division VII co-player 
of the year after dominating opponents in the playoffs. Fonua shared the award 
with Montclair Prep running back Wilbert Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Fonua was one of four Mira Costa players chosen to the Division VII team. The 
others were senior offensive lineman Tate McCallister, senior defensive lineman 
Miguel Prieto and junior defensive back Dino Rossi. Redondo senior running back 
Bob Cracknell, the South Bay's leading rusher with 1,709 yards, also was 
selected. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawthorne and Peninsula, which finished 1-2 in the Bay League, each placed 
four players on the Division III team. Hawthorne was represented by Morgan, 
junior defensive back Kelvin Hunter, senior offensive lineman David Camacho and 
senior defensive lineman Daniel Dorsey. Tailback James Durroh, a repeat 
selection, joined Peninsula teammates Welbourn, senior tight end-kicker Keith 
Harter and senior linebacker Tony Persichina on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Leuzinger was represented on the Division III squad by junior linebacker Aaron 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, whose 98-yard, fourth-quarter touchdown run was the highlight of 
Newbury Park's 22-14 victory over Hawthorne in the championship game, was named 
Division III player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Five South Bay players were selected to the Division IX team. Pioneer League 
co-champion West Torrance was represented by senior offensive lineman Ryan 
Winkler and junior free safety Jim Yates, North Torrance placed senior 
quarterback Rocky Jackson and senior running back-defensive back Lacy Watkins 
on the team, and junior defensive lineman Matt Jasik of El Segundo was also 
chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior running back Jasch Janowicz of division champion Atascadero was named 
Division IX player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Serra senior linebacker Milford Kinnard was selected to the Division VIII team 
and two-way lineman Bryan Luxembourger of division runner-up Costa Mesa was 
named player of the year.

 The Washington Redskins are interested in Dallas offensive coordinator Norv 
Turner as their new coach, but NFL rules prohibit them from talking to Turner 
until the Cowboys have been eliminated from the playoffs. . . . Houston 
defensive coordinator Buddy Ryan said he is interested in either of the 
coaching vacancies at Washington or Atlanta. . . . Detroit running back Barry 
Sanders, who sprained his left knee in a Thanksgiving Day loss to the Chicago 
Bears, practiced for the first time Wednesday and might start Saturday when the 
Lions play host to Green Bay in a first-round NFC playoff game.

CITY GOES AFTER GANG MEMBERS ON TOP 25 LIST; CRIME: DEPUTIES ARE TARGETING 
THOSE CONSIDERED THE MOST VIOLENT. IN EIGHT MONTHS, 30 HAVE BEEN ARRESTED OR 
LEFT TOWN. NEW NAMES HAVE REPLACED THEM ON THE LIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lil Zig Zag was arrested on murder charges. Joker's sitting in jail, accused 
of armed robbery. And Gizmo moved out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 So Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies knocked three names off Paramount's 
list. And three more were waiting to take their places. 
</P>
<P>
 "The list" is not where a young man living in Paramount wants to be these 
days. It names the 25 youths considered to be the most violent gang members in 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 Those on the list can expect to see a deputy two to four times a day. Six 
deputies have been added to Paramount streets to watch the targeted gang 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 The list is the core of Paramount's new Target Program -- the city's most 
recent attempt to salvage its image as a quiet suburb. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the program began eight months ago, at least 30 youths have been jailed 
-- sometimes as a direct result of surveillance -- or have abruptly moved out 
of town and out of the spotlight, according to Sheriff's Department and city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The department's top brass is excited about the program, enough so to send the 
idea to a national law enforcement organization, which will distribute it to 
interested agencies nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not saying Paramount is crime-free, but the gang problem is way down," 
Deputy City Manager Patrick West said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of 10 homicides in the city in 1992, seven were considered gang-related. 
Although killings increased to 14 during 1993, just three were gang-related, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Businessman Chuck Lyons gauges gang activity by the amount of graffiti he has 
to clean off the 94 warehouses his company, Fu-Lyons Associates, owns or 
manages in town. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can tell you graffiti is way down, and we take that as a real good sign," 
Lyons said. "We tell people who are thinking of moving here about the Target 
Program, and it is a big selling point." 
</P>
<P>
 For deputies, the case of Bouncer is one example of the program's success. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouncer, 20, whose real name is Adrian Guerrero, was on the list. Sheriff's 
deputies had contacted him repeatedly. He knew, no doubt, that he was being 
watched. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Sept. 22, he and another young man went to Downey with a .380 Beretta 
automatic handgun. At 4:30 p.m., they walked into Omega Burger at Lakewood 
Boulevard and Imperial Highway, pulled the gun and demanded cash, Downey police 
Detective Ed Compton said. Bouncer and the accomplice got $371 and took off, 
just as Compton pulled up in an unmarked car. The officer followed but got 
mired in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a deputy from the Paramount sheriff's substation heard the robbery 
report on the police radio and drove to the Downey border. In a mini-mall 
parking lot, he saw Bouncer and the other youth and decided to talk with them. 
While they were talking, the radio squawked out complete descriptions of the 
two robbery suspects. The deputy realized he was looking right at them. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerrero was convicted of armed robbery and sentenced in November to seven 
years in prison. The 17-year-old was not charged because witnesses were unable 
to identify him. 
</P>
<P>
 A list of Target Program successes also includes such entries as: 
</P>
<P>
 * M-Loc, 17, nine previous arrests. "Released from custody, moved to Arizona. 
Moved back and now in CYA Camp." 
</P>
<P>
 * Gangster, 22, 10 previous arrests. "Felony arrest for assault with a gun." 
</P>
<P>
 * D-Dog, 20, two previous arrests. "Felony arrest for robbery." 
</P>
<P>
 * Sniper, 17, three previous arrests. "Felony arrest for assault -- sentenced 
to eight years prison." 
</P>
<P>
 Two youths on the list died. One was shot in a South-Central Los Angeles 
gunfight. Another walked through a plate-glass window in Orange County while 
under the influence of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 In at least one case, a targeted gang member went to Paramount's new 
substation and asked about the program. Then he announced his intention to 
leave the city. He has not been seen in town since, West said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And there are some that just grow out of (gangbanging), but they are few and 
far between," Sgt. Peggy O'Neal said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Sheriff's Capt. John Anderson, all 25 youths on the initial list 
are in jail or have moved out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies closest to the program say it is nearly impossible to give an exact 
count of how many gang members have left town. Sometimes, the list changes 
quickly as deputies receive new information on who has been sent to jail or has 
moved. 
</P>
<P>
 To get on the list, a youth must be a gang member as defined by state law, 
meaning he or she must claim membership to a gang whose members engage in 
criminal activity, O'Neal said. After that one criterion is met, selection to 
the target list becomes more subjective. A violent history is certainly a 
common denominator, but not all have been arrested for violent acts. 
</P>
<P>
 One youth, who goes by the street name Toro, was added to the list after he 
was shot at twice by "rival gang members," said Public Safety Director Robert 
D. Robinson. Toro's mother was caught in the cross-fire once, suffering bullet 
wounds in her face. Another time, cheerleader Sheila Lorta, 16, was killed by a 
bullet probably meant for Toro, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Toro is also suspected of other gang activities, said Robinson, who would not 
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Civil Liberties Union has expressed concern about the Target 
Program, saying the deputies' tactics could cross the line into harassment. The 
ACLU requested information on the program from the Sheriff's Department months 
ago, but the request has gone unanswered, said Mark Silverstein, an ACLU 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 City and sheriff's officials refused to reveal the names or criminal histories 
of those on the list. Even in cases where an adult was arrested and convicted, 
making the name part of the public record, officials would not reveal the 
identities of the people on the list. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they are secretive about the list, officials say they are convinced 
that the program is working -- and necessary. They knew a new tactic was 
needed, West said, after three 1992 slayings. 
</P>
<P>
 In three high-profile cases that year, suspected gang members killed three 
people who were, or had been, students at Paramount High School: Alfred Clark, 
17, a star athlete who was shot the day before graduation after refusing to 
surrender his compact disc player at a McDonald's restaurant near campus; 
Lorta, the cheerleader who was on a break from practice and was caught in a 
drive-by shooting; and Maritza Bonilla, 21, an aspiring hairstylist, who was 
fatally wounded at her sister's birthday party in a drive-by shooting that 
injured nine others. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More than any other incidents, these three cases made city leaders take stock 
and realize they were losing the war against gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all started with the Alfred Clark murder, really. It was a pointless, 
needless, horrible murder," West said. 
</P>
<P>
 A task force of about 60 city officials, residents, teachers and deputies 
brainstormed and came up with the Target Program. In April, the City Council 
agreed to raise the utility users' tax by 2%, which costs the average family $3 
a month, to generate $1 million a year and pay for six new deputies, a crime 
analyst and new equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the Target Program, Robinson, the civilian head of Paramount's 
Public Safety Department, has become a sworn officer, giving him more control 
of day-to-day Sheriff's Department operations, although he is not attached to 
any department. 
</P>
<P>
 The money also paid for one fairly inexpensive item: a magnetic bulletin board 
in the substation's back room where deputies check their targets. Then deputies 
take to the streets, keeping in mind that 25 youths out there need a visit.

YOUTH PROJECT TAKES AIM AT GANG GRAFFITI WITH BROAD STROKES; VANDALISM: 
POLICE-SPONSORED PLAN TO PAINT OVER SCRAWLS GIVES TAGGERS WHO HAVE BEEN 
ARRESTED A CHANCE TO CLEAN THE SLATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The seven youths gathered near the wall fit the stereotype of neighborhood 
gang members. Sporting close-cropped hair and baggy pants, they were armed with 
paint and poised to use it on the inviting expanse of bricks. 
</P>
<P>
 But these gang members are removing graffiti, covering it with careful strokes 
in a hue that matches the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 The young men, participants in the Southeast Area Gang Project to redirect 
gang members, were referred to the program after being arrested for crimes such 
as vandalism, spraying graffiti, shoplifting or breaking and entering. Rather 
than convict juveniles of such crimes and establish a criminal record, courts 
often refer youths to community service programs such as the police-sponsored 
graffiti cleanup project. 
</P>
<P>
 Each youth will spend from eight to more than 100 hours removing graffiti and 
collecting trash. In addition, they will undergo group and individual 
counseling, and their parents will be referred to adult classes for parents of 
problem youths. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southeast area has about 10,000 gang members and 50 gangs, said South Gate 
Police Department Capt. Brad Hooper, program manager for the gang project. 
</P>
<P>
 The project was formed in 1992 with a three-year, $500,000 grant from the 
Office of Criminal Justice Planning. The project tries to tackle the gang 
problem through law enforcement, prosecution, probation, education and 
community service programs, Hooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cleanup program was added in March and is run through Project JADE 
(Juvenile Assistance Diversion Effort), a nonprofit agency that provides 
anti-gang education programs and counseling to 7,000 students throughout the 
Southeast area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first year we tried to refer these kids to other graffiti cleanup 
programs, no one wanted them because they didn't look right or whatever 
reason," said JADE director Marcos Vega. "So we said if no one will do it, we 
will." 
</P>
<P>
 The group borrows a truck and paint supplies from the city Public Works 
Department and heads out at 8:30 a.m. each Saturday for a four-hour shift. If 
no painting equipment is available, they pick up trash instead. Part of the 
reason for the early hour is "to protect the kids" from rival gang members, 
Vega said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cleanup and removal program provides both a community service and a 
humbling lesson, Vega said. "They see how difficult it is to clean up," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Alvarez, a gang member who at 17 has spent four years in and out of youth 
camps, was sentenced to 100 hours of community service and sounded cynical 
about the purpose of the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's to teach a kind of lesson, to think twice before you write on a wall," 
he said. "I get a kick out of it but it don't do nothing for me. I get all 
dirty, that's all . . . It's fun. You're talking and laughing and painting over 
(the tags of) people you don't like." 
</P>
<P>
 But Alvarez's actions belied his tough talk. He was the first to leap off the 
truck to paint out a wall, and says he is less active in his gang now. 
</P>
<P>
 About 85% of the youths complete the program and there is a 10% recidivism 
rate, Vega said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is perhaps most effective when a youth is forced to wipe out tags 
written by his own gang or crew. 
</P>
<P>
 First-time offender Chris Portillo, 14, who was arrested for tagging, admits 
he has learned a lesson from the paint-out program. Portillo had to confront 
the markings of his own tagging crew on one of his first cleanup outings. 
</P>
<P>
 Portillo, who has been kicked out of two local junior highs, has been 
sentenced to 40 hours of cleanup for tagging. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's teaching me," he said. "I'm paying for what I did. I stopped tagging so 
far. I'm still in (the crew) but no writing. I don't wanna get caught no more."

LIVING AND LEARNING; DORM LIFE GIVES HIGH SCHOOL KIDS A CHANCE TO SUCCEED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 With her divorced mother working full time, 17-year-old Shalana McGhee had to 
do the washing, ironing, cleaning, cooking and baby-sitting at home when 
child-care arrangements fell through. 
</P>
<P>
 She was so anxious to keep up with her studies, however, that one day she 
dressed her 6- and 8-year-old sisters and took them with her on the school bus 
to her classes at the California Academy of Mathematics and Science. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a project due . . . I had to come to school," says the lanky teen-ager, 
a senior at the academy, a high school on the Carson campus of Cal State 
University, Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the academy is not insured to transport younger children, Shalana's 
trip with her sisters caused a ruckus. But 
</P>
<P>
 it also brought home to academy officials why her grades were dropping 
dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 Shalana was moved into a university dorm with 11 other academy students, who, 
like her, had home lives that threatened to sink them academically. The dorm 
program, begun in 1992, is working for Shalana. Today, the would-be pharmacist 
is pulling A's and Bs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shalana's problem was so bad she used to fall asleep in school," says Sandra 
Elliott, who helped set up the program. She and two other teachers live in the 
dorms. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded four years ago by eight area school districts, including Long Beach 
Unified and Compton Unified, the academy seeks to increase the number of women 
and minorities headed for math and science careers. Eighty-three percent of the 
481 students this school year are minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The dorm program, underwritten by two foundations, is a graphic illustration 
of what it takes to accommodate largely low-income students who are bright but 
find it hard to balance school with the burdens of home life. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he moved into the dorm, 17-year-old Alex Caro shared a three-bedroom 
house in Huntington Park with his parents and four younger siblings. He had no 
quiet place to study. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of distractions," he says. "Mostly there's a lot of kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Exhaustion drove some of the students into the dorms -- in some cases because 
they lived so far away. They had to rise before dawn and ride two hours by bus 
to get to the academy each morning. They got home so late at night, they often 
labored past midnight trying to keep up with the rigorous curriculum, which 
includes college science and math courses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got to the point," recalls Jess Farias, who lives with his mother and 
younger sister in Los Angeles at Vermont Avenue and 23rd Street, "where my 
mother would drive me a lot so I could sleep more. But, then, she was late for 
her job. . . . I'm doing this to make it easier on her."  
</P>
<P>
 For other of the students, home life became too painful for them to cope, with 
or without heavy academic demands. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents have, like, an unstable marriage," says Irma Hernandez, 17. "I'd 
be going back and forth to my brother's a lot. Now, my brother takes care of 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Irma's older brother, a truck driver, pays the $30 a week she needs to cover 
food costs in the dorm because their father, she says, refused to pay it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I miss about home," Irma says, "is my little sister (age 10). 
She calls all the time. She called tonight because she needed help with her 
homework." 
</P>
<P>
 What Irma likes best about dorm living, she says, is that when she has trouble 
with her studies she can ask other students or a teacher for help or go to the 
nearby college library. "And I don't have to listen to my parents fight or 
anything like that," she adds. 
</P>
<P>
 For Jessica Morales, also 17, the dorms provided an escape from a situation 
that had become so painful her grades were near failing. She had to baby-sit 
for two younger half-siblings and did not get along with her stepfather. Her 
parents refused to pay the $30 a week for food, she says, so a grandfather 
stepped in to pay it. 
</P>
<P>
 "(My parents) made me feel I was being selfish because I wanted to live here 
and go to school," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Farmer, 17, doesn't talk much about his family except to say that he 
doesn't communicate with his father and that his mother and sisters don't value 
education as he does. "I've been told the only thing you have in life is your 
education," Andre says. 
</P>
<P>
 When his mother and sisters moved to Northern California, Andre found a family 
who took him in, so he has a place to go on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the students want to live in a dorm because their neighborhoods are 
simply too hazardous. One is Jermaine Augustus, who is 17 and the youngest of 
10 children, and hopes to study chemistry or biomedicine in college. He lives 
with his mother in an apartment near the Los Angeles Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did Jermaine have a long bus ride each day to school, but his 
neighbors were noisy and destroyed his science project. Andre was cultivating 
bean sprouts, measuring the progress of each container crop as it related to 
the different amounts of light it received. 
</P>
<P>
 He used to put the sprouts on the apartment house balcony for part of the day, 
with Jermaine's mother watching over them. Then, one day, "when I got home, 
they were all crushed," Jermaine recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Zalika Davis refers to her home as a place where there was always a "lot of 
fussing going on." Her parents at one point had a family of 13. "My mom had all 
these foster children and most of them were drug babies and everything," Zalika 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 The students live four to each dorm apartment, with the academy and the 
university paying for everything but food. All the students go home on weekends 
but several said they can't wait to return on Sunday night, even though the 
routine is strict. They have to be in by 9:30 p.m. and they must share cleaning 
and cooking chores. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a family away from home," says 17-year-old Justin Reid. "Andre and 
Jermaine are like my brothers."

CITY COUNCIL KILLS BALLOT MEASURE TO GIVE MAYOR A VOTE; POLITICS: ERNIE KELL, 
ANGRY AT REJECTION OF PROPOSAL, VOWS TO LAUNCH GRASS-ROOTS PETITION DRIVE TO 
GAIN VOTER APPROVAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has scuttled a proposed ballot measure that would have given 
the mayor a vote on council matters, but an angry Mayor Ernie Kell vowed to 
fire up a grass-roots petition drive to place the issue before voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members voted 7-1 against the measure Tuesday, saying its impact was 
not fully known and it should not be rushed onto the April or June ballots. In 
addition to giving a vote to the mayor, who now has only weak veto power, the 
measure would have reorganized the City Council into eight districts, instead 
of nine, to avoid tie votes. 
</P>
<P>
 But an irate Kell accused council members of killing the measure because they 
did not want to see their power diminished. Kell, a wealthy property owner, 
said he would organize and spend plenty of his own money on a petition drive to 
place a measure on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's ludicrous to have a position of mayor in Long Beach and not to have a 
vote," said Kell, who is seeking reelection in the April 12 municipal election. 
"The mayor will have a vote. That you can count on for the fall." 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify a measure for the ballot, supporters must gather 27,223 signatures, 
15% of the city's registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach residents voted in 1988 to create the position of a full-time 
mayor, who is elected at-large and earns $84,221 a year. Previously, the 
position rotated among the nine part-time council members, who are elected by 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 But the full-time mayor has little power. Kell chairs council meetings and 
voices his opinion, but he has no vote and only limited veto power. In most 
cases, a simple majority of the council can override a mayoral veto. 
</P>
<P>
 Kell and other community leaders have long called for the mayor to have either 
a vote or a strong veto -- requiring a two-thirds council vote -- to improve 
the mayor's ability to lead. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of citizens, led by developer and harbor commissioner Alex 
Bellehumeur, proposed the ballot measure two months ago. Proponents had said 
they hoped the council would approve the measure for the April ballot, but the 
council balked. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice Mayor Jeffrey A. Kellogg and Councilman Ray Grabinski, who have entered 
the mayoral race against Kell, said there was not enough time to study the 
proposal. Tuesday is the deadline for council action to place a measure on the 
April ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Grabinski, who is giving up his seat to run for mayor, railed against Kell's 
allegation that council members were simply trying to protect their power. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an issue of power between the mayor and the City Council. . . . 
This is a matter of representation," Grabinski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Alan S. Lowenthal said reducing the number of council seats would 
reduce the voice of neighborhoods in local government. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Doris Topsy-Elvord, an African American and the only ethnic 
minority on the council, expressed concern that redistricting would hurt the 
chances for more minorities to win election. 
</P>
<P>
 The lone vote for the measure came from Councilman Les Robbins, who proposed 
giving the mayor a vote and leaving intact the city's nine council districts. 
Robbins said he was not overly concerned about tie votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Give the mayor a vote," he said. "In the event of a tie, (a proposal) loses." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Tom Clark was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Kell said he would work with community groups to draw up a new measure and 
launch a petition drive to qualify it for the ballot. The measure would give 
the mayor either a vote or a strong veto to "redistribute power" at City Hall, 
Kell said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We'll work out the language and we will not be asking the council for their 
approval," said Kell, who vowed to press forward whether or not he wins 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 But history indicates Kell faces an uphill battle. Long Beach voters turned 
down ballot measures in 1990 and 1992 that would have given the mayor a 
stronger veto. The council had placed both measures on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related action Tuesday, the council also killed a proposal to ask voters 
to double council members' salaries of $21,055 a year if the number of 
districts was reduced to eight.

COMMUNITY DIGEST: VERNON; MEAT PLANT TO GET $7 MILLION FOR EXPANSION AND JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clougherty Packing Co., maker of Dodger Dogs and other meat products under the 
Farmer John label, will receive $7 million to finance an expansion project that 
will bring 100 new jobs to the Southeast area. 
</P>
<P>
 The funding, made available through tax-exempt bonds being issued through the 
city, will enable the company to replace outdated buildings and equipment at 
its meat-processing plant at 3049 E. Vernon Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 The finance plan was approved recently by the California Development Financing 
Advisory Commission. The commission issues tax-exempt bonds to provide small 
manufacturing firms with capital to create jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vernon City Council voted last year to form an Industrial Development 
Authority, a nonprofit entity to act as a conduit for the state bonds, said 
Gerald Forde, an assistant to the city administrator who specializes in 
economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were concerned about the loss of jobs and the loss of tradition in the 
city," Forde said. "We serve as an employment base for adjacent communities, so 
we're concerned when companies like (Clougherty) need help." 
</P>
<P>
 About 53,000 people work in Vernon, but the city lost 991 jobs in 1992, Forde 
said, and has lost at least 18 major companies since 1980. Farmer John is one 
of the city's largest remaining employers with 1,181 workers.

COMMUNITY DIGEST: WHITTIER; COURT TO DECIDE DAMAGES FOR CITY'S IMPROPER FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge is expected to decide Friday how much Whittier must pay 
for charging improper fees to the former owner of one of the city's larger 
shopping centers. The penalty is expected to be at least $350,000, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Superior Court jury earlier found that Whittier improperly 
charged Golden West Properties $350,000 for a letter advising the Beverly 
Hills-based developer on sales tax liability. The letter should have been 
provided free, the jury ruled. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Golden West was in the process of selling the Whittier Quad, a 
32-acre Whittier-area shopping complex, to Schurgin Development, a Los 
Angeles-based company, for an estimated $17 million, Whittier City Manager Tom 
Mauk said. The letter stated that Golden West was not responsible for paying 
taxes on the sale of the shopping center, commonly called The Quad. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials contend they did not charge Golden West for the letter. They 
said the $350,000 was paid to the city as part of a complex contractual 
arrangement with the developer. The city will appeal the verdict, Mauk said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing at 8:30 a.m. Friday before Judge Ernest Williams in Los Angeles is 
to determine how much money the city may owe Golden West in interest and 
attorney's fees, in addition to repayment of the $350,000.

CHRISTMAS TREE RECYCLING; MANY CITIES PICK UP TREES; COUNTY HAS DROP-OFF SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most Southeast area cities offer Christmas tree recycling. The trees are 
usually ground up and used instead of soil as cover at the Puente Hills 
Landfill.This saves space since the trees would otherwise be thrown into the 
landfill and extra soil added to cover them. Some of the shredded trees are 
also used as plant mulch. 
</P>
<P>
 A drop-off site is available to all Los Angeles County residents from 8 a.m. 
to 4 p.m. Saturday and Sunday. It is in Whittier at Gunn Avenue Park, 10130 
Gunn Ave. Trees are not accepted with ornaments, stands or nails. 
</P>
<P>
 Many cities also pick up trees. Residents must remove all decorations and, for 
pick up, leave their trees at the curb. 
</P>
<P>
 For Christmas tree recycling, call the county hot line: (800) 552-5218. 
Residents seeking information about curbside pickup should call city hall or 
the waste management company that serves their city.

COMMUNITY DIGEST: WHITTIER; POLICE GET 3 1/2% PAY RAISE; OTHER EMPLOYEES GIVEN 
2% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council ended six months of negotiations recently by approving the 
first pay raise for Whittier employees in two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 0 to give a 3 1/2% pay raise to the city's 93 police 
officers and a 2% pay raise to the other 290 employees.Councilman Michael 
Sullens was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 The wage increases will be retroactive to Nov. 1 and will cost the city about 
$320,000 a year. Police and employee union negotiators had asked for a 5% to 6% 
raise. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Tom Mauk called the negotiations tense and difficult. "It was a 
tough process, but everyone came to the conclusion in December that we had done 
the best we could," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Money for the police officers was available from Proposition 172 funds, the 
half-cent sales tax initiative for public safety that was approved in November, 
Mauk said.

COMMUNITY DIGEST: WHITTIER; AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECT CONSTRUCTION TO BEGIN 
SOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Construction of a nine-unit condominium project for moderate- and low-income 
families near Whittier Park is scheduled to begin in this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council recently approved $365,000 in redevelopment funds to help 
finance the project, which will be developed and partially funded by a Whittier 
bank and an area housing association. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the project is estimated at $1.4 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The condominiums, which will be in three buildings, will replace dilapidated 
structures near the intersection of Union Avenue and Penn Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Development of the condominiums is the final phase of a project to help a 
neighborhood hit by crime. Earlier efforts, which included cleanup campaigns 
and renovations of Whittier Park, have reduced graffiti, litter and gang 
activity, City Manager Tom Mauk said. 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra Neighborhood Housing Services and the Whittier-based Quaker City 
Federal Savings will build the condominiums and provide financing to residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 0 on Dec. 21 to approve the development, which has a 
completion date of next January. Councilman Michael Sullens was absent.

COMMUNITY DIGEST: LONG BEACH; NEW HOT LINE GETS 6 CALLS ABOUT GUNS AT SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Long Beach Police Department received six calls about guns during the 
first two days of a new hot line to report weapons on school campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Cmdr.Anthony Batts said only one of the callers had information that was 
useful to police. The student called to report seeing a fellow student carrying 
a gun during classes. 
</P>
<P>
 To report the presence of a gun, students can call police at (310) 570-5800, 
24 hours a day, without identifying themselves, Batts said. Police will 
investigate the calls or refer them to district security officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The hot line was announced by Long Beach school officials last month during a 
visit to Wilson High School by state Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren. Just before 
Lungren's visit, a 16-year-old student was shot in the leg in front of the 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Guns and safety have been a concern to school officials because of the rising 
number of weapons confiscated on campus, said Dick Van Der Laan, school 
district spokesman. Last year, school district officials seized 37 weapons, 
compared with 24 during the 1990-91 school year. This year, only two weapons 
have been seized, and officials believe publicity about the hot line has 
helped. School officials also plan to post flyers about the hot line at all 
high schools and middle schools, Van Der Laan said.

COMMUNITY DIGEST: THE REGION; HOMEOWNERS WARNED OF FAKE PLUMBING INSPECTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reports of people posing as water company workers have prompted the San 
Gabriel Valley Water Co. to alert its 45,000 customers in Whittier, Montebello, 
Hacienda Heights and the San Gabriel Valley to beware of anyone asking to enter 
a home to inspect the plumbing. 
</P>
<P>
 The alert followed complaints last year about thefts by people who represented 
themselves as water company employees to enter houses. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Monte-based utility is notifying its customers that normally a water 
company employee would not ask to enter a house. This would happen only if a 
customer had previously contacted the company. Company officials also said any 
questions about whether someone is an employee can be directed to the customer 
service office at (818) 448-6183.

PORT OF LOS ANGELES TO CLOSE JAPAN OFFICE, HIRE MARKETING FIRM INSTEAD; TRADE: 
HIGH COSTS AND PROTOCOL PITFALLS OF DOING BUSINESS IN TOKYO PROMPT BOARD TO 
CHANGE STRATEGY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA RICHARDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a cup of coffee costing $7 (no refills included), and a no-frills dinner 
running about $100, it is little wonder that the Port of Los Angeles was 
spending more than half a million dollars a year to staff a one-person office 
in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The high costs have prompted the Board of Harbor Commissioners to close the 
office at the end of this month and hire a marketing firm, Japan Marine 
Services of Tokyo, to represent port interests there. The change will save the 
port about $200,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were looking at ways to enhance our marketing while cutting costs, and we 
decided it was in our best interest to go with an agency rather than a 
proprietary operation," port marketing director Al Fierstine said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It affords us the opportunity to use their resources rather than just one 
man," he said. "And it also affords us (the opportunity) to use their 25- to 
30-member administrative staff rather than paying for a full-time office, which 
is where the real savings comes in." 
</P>
<P>
 The port's Japan office, one of 12 such offices worldwide, has operated for at 
least 20 years. It has been staffed by Shuji Nomura, whose contract expires 
Jan. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Nomura has been responsible for gathering information about marketing and 
maritime trends and developments likely to affect Los Angeles port operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tell us what top customers are doing from a corporate level -- being 
that corporations do not always pass on to local (Los Angeles) offices 
information about when they're considering rerouting their cargo or other moves 
they may make," Fierstine said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to guarding the port's maritime marketing interests, Japan Marine 
Services will continue working to expand the sea-to-air cargo market of 
shipments bound for New York, Europe or South America through Los Angeles 
International Airport. Cargo holds at the Los Angeles airport are almost full, 
but port officials believe the market could be expanded to airports in Ontario 
and Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, since Congress approved of the North American Free Trade Agreement, the 
port has begun to encourage customers to use it for sending products to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies from Japan, Hong Kong and Taiwan make up a large bloc of the port's 
customers. Successful dealings with Japanese businesses are linked to a mastery 
of Japanese etiquette and protocol. 
</P>
<P>
 Although port officials say they have been careful to observe Japanese customs 
when dealing with Japanese business people (for example, presenting a business 
card pulled from a shirt pocket rather than from a card case can derail 
negotiations), employing a Japanese company for port marketing can only help. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Japan itself, when you're marketing, it's better to have the locals 
marketing to the locals," Fierstine said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fierstine has heard numerous tales of how cultural ignorance by American 
business people has led to marketing fiascoes. 
</P>
<P>
 "American companies don't always do the proper marketing, and it has caused 
real problems," he said. He tells a story about how a U.S. beer manufacturer 
began selling its product in Taiwan without doing research that would have 
shown that Taiwanese get their medicine in bottles the same size and color as 
beer bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a major faux pas ," Fierstine said.

COACH MARINE CANO LEAVING CAL STATE DOMINGUEZ HILLS; SOCCER: UC IRVINE HIRES 
AWAY VETERAN ADMINISTRATOR TO DIRECT ITS PROGRAM AND COACH WOMEN'S TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Mr. Soccer" is leaving Cal State Dominguez Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Marine Cano, a recognizable figure in the Southland soccer community, has been 
named director of soccer and head women's coach at UC Irvine. He had been 
director of soccer and coach of the men's and women's teams at Cal State 
Dominguez Hills since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 He also served as coach of the California girls' under-19 Olympic Development 
team and directed camps that attracted more than 1,000 youths this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very excited about bringing in an individual of Marine's abilities," 
said Dan Guerrero, who was athletic director at Dominguez Hills until taking 
the same position at Irvine in 1992. "He's a proven recruiter, a proven 
fund-raiser, and he's done a great job of administrating two programs. And he's 
had success at every level he's coached in." 
</P>
<P>
 At Dominguez Hills, Cano's women's teams have been ranked in the top 20 in 
each of the past six seasons. The Toros won the NCAA Division II title in 1991. 
From 1984-88, the women's team competed on the Division I level and compiled a 
48-30-10 record. They were ranked eighth in the nation in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely a loss for us," Dominguez Hills Athletic Director Kay Don 
said. "He brought us a national championship. We really are disappointed that 
we're not going to have him anymore, but we also know it's a good step for him 
and he's really excited." 
</P>
<P>
 Cano, 39, says his goal will be NCAA championships for the men's and women's 
teams, and he will work with men's Coach Derek Lawther toward that end. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be an extra set of hands and extra set of eyes for Derek," said Cano, 
who played for the California Sunshine in 1979 when Lawther was coach. "I'll 
offer specialized help with coaching and help recruit. I want to find out what 
he needs and then start working together to get it done." 
</P>
<P>
 Cano realizes that coaching may be the easy part. Fund raising, always a tough 
job at Irvine, will be a key to the soccer program's failure or success. If the 
Anteaters hope to compete with the nation's top teams, much of the money for 
scholarships will have to come from fund raising. 
</P>
<P>
 "I already have a lot of great contacts in the soccer community, but you don't 
just go out asking for money," Cano said. "My players and I will be out in the 
community, giving clinics for players and coaches, letting them know we want to 
help them. You have to give something if you want to get support in return. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't a 9-to-5 job. You have to find the time every single day to hit on 
all the reasons you were hired. It's not going to be easy. But soccer has been 
my passion for a long time, and beyond my family, it's my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Cano, a former goalkeeper, was a member of the 1976 U.S. national team and 
played nine years of professional soccer. He served as an assistant coach at 
Cal and UCLA and was head coach at El Camino College.

LABOR TALKS REACH IMPASSE

 Contract negotiations between the city and its two employee unions have 
reached an impasse, and some workers say they are considering a work slowdown 
later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 About 140 employees in City Hall and the Water Department have worked without 
a contract since October and without a raise since 1989.The employees include 
librarians, secretaries, engineers, planners, and maintenance workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has offered employees a 3% bonus, but the offer was rejected. The 
employees are seeking raises similar to those negotiated last summer by the 
city's police officers and firefighters, said Robin Nahin, a representative of 
the Downey City Employees Assn. and Downey Maintenance Employees Assn.  
</P>
<P>
 Police and firefighters signed two-year contracts last summer that contained 
annual 3% raises for 1993 and 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Manager Lee Powell said the city is tightening its belt because 
last year's $58-million budget left little in reserve.  
</P>
<P>
 Powell said the police and fire unions -- which had also gone three years 
without raises -- were given the increase because they provide priority 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 A state mediator is scheduled to meet with both sides Jan. 25, but the 
maintenance employees are considering a work slowdown, Nahin said. JILL

A WELCOME ADDITION; O.C. PROGRAM IS GIVING FIRST-TIME PARENTS TRAINING IN 
INFANT CARE. IT'S PART OF AN EFFORT TO STOP CHILD NEGLECT BEFORE IT STARTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Buy an ant farm, and you get a set of detailed instructions. Same with lawn 
mowers, fountain pens, and even things as seemingly self-explanatory as 
mattresses and electric fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, new owners are automatically instructed in everything except the most 
precious thing: babies. 
</P>
<P>
 When Anya Wilson gave birth to Joshua eight months ago, her lack of 
child-rearing knowledge was compounded by her age -- 15 -- and what she says is 
a non-supportive family. Being pregnant, she couldn't stay enrolled at 
Fullerton High School, and she says tension at home led her to move in with her 
boyfriend, Scott Paley, 19, and his parents in their Placentia apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't close with Joshua at first," Anya said. "I was very resentful. . . . 
I lost my friends. They don't visit now. When he was crying it made me nervous 
because I didn't know how to make him stop. Scott's mother helped a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 But in October, she heard about Welcome Baby, a support system for first-time 
parents that is believed to be the only one of its kind in the state. The 
program, administered by the Exchange Club Child Abuse Prevention Center of 
Orange County, provides information on child rearing in an effort to stop 
infant neglect before it starts. 
</P>
<P>
 The private, nonprofit Exchange Club center, supported by county funds and 
donations from 17 private service clubs in Orange County, trains volunteers to 
work with government-referred families who have abused or are at risk of 
abusing their children. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Welcome Baby program, trained volunteers meet with parents in their 
homes six hours a week for three months. They teach basic care techniques such 
as feeding, diapering and bathing, and discuss infant behavior and how to build 
trust. 
</P>
<P>
 To Exchange Club officials, the rising incidence of child abuse is more than 
enough reason to lend a hand to young couples who are feeling the pressures of 
parenthood. Between 1991 and 1992, reports of abuse to Orange County children 
under 1 year old increased 16%. The 2,390 reports were 6% of the 36,014 for all 
age groups recorded last year by the Child Abuse Registry of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Among children 3 and younger, "we get a lot with prenatally drug-exposed 
infants, a lot of physical reports with spiral fractures (in which the bone is 
twisted apart), which is a classic child abuse injury," says Ray Gallagher, 
registry director. 
</P>
<P>
 But neglect is the most common form of infant abuse and, through education, 
the most preventable, says Lois Wood, executive director of the Costa 
Mesa-based Exchange Club Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's simply a lack of knowledge sometimes. Say, not knowing how to feed," 
Wood says. "A child can literally be starving to death, and the parents don't 
know what's happening. The reality of parenting comes when you're home with the 
tiny baby in your arms and you can't get him to stop crying. Without love, 
attention or handling, a child can waste away, start to deteriorate." 
</P>
<P>
 Wood came up with the idea for Welcome Baby after learning of a similar 
program in Winston-Salem, N.C. A $12,000 grant from PacifiCare and the 
Orangewood Children's Foundation has funded the program since it began in June, 
and Wood is counting on another $30,000 grant for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Early intervention not only improves the infant's quality of life, but also 
helps prevent taxpayer-funded trips through the foster care and welfare systems 
later on, Exchange Club officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the 27 Welcome Baby volunteers also work with the Exchange Club's 
other child abuse programs, and all have child-rearing experience, Wood said, 
adding that more Spanish-speaking volunteers are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Five single mothers have completed the program so far, and 19 clients are 
currently getting instruction, a number that program coordinator Denine Ellis 
hopes to double. Clients enter the program voluntarily, and most are told about 
it by hospital staff members, whom Ellis visits regularly to talk up the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year in Orange County, more than 4,800 babies are born to mothers 10 to 
19 years old. These young mothers can be bewildered by the birthing experience, 
Ellis says. "When you're at the hospital, if you don't ask the nurses questions 
about the baby, they assume you know," she said. "Then you get home and say: 
'Now what?' " 
</P>
<P>
 That's when a friendly volunteer, armed with gifts of disposable diapers, a 
plastic bathtub and answers to perplexing questions, can be a welcome sight 
indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteer Beth Hansen recently made her second visit to see Anya, Scott and 
their baby. Anya's bonding with Joshua had improved, Hansen said, although too 
much rich food over the holidays contributed to a diaper rash that concerned 
Anya. Hansen, 33, a mother of two, discussed skin care, diets for babies and 
the importance of a feeding schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Joshua, alert and curious, knew he was somehow the center of attention, and to 
stay in that center was willing to maintain eye contact and ignore the colorful 
plastic toys that littered the living room floor. For the third session, Hansen 
said she plans to tour the three-bedroom apartment and point out dangerous 
household items and areas that need baby-proofing. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen also volunteers as a parent aide for the Exchange Club, teaching 
parenting to families that are already in the child abuse cycle. The Welcome 
Baby program, she says, "has more joy involved, more happiness, because the 
baby has not been taken away from the parents." 
</P>
<P>
 Anya and Scott say they plan to marry, but not before Anya gets her high 
school equivalency degree and Scott, who has graduated, finds steady work. Anya 
attends Horizon Education Center in Anaheim several hours each week. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, she is grateful for the baby training. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very good. I wish girls who need help would do it," Anya said. "You 
learn a lot of stuff. Also, it's just somebody to be with, to talk to and be 
there for you when you need them."

BOOKS & AUTHORS: NINA VIDA GETS A HOLLYWOOD INTRODUCTION; 'GOODBYE SAIGON,' THE 
HUNTINGTON BEACH WRITER'S FOURTH NOVEL, WON'T BE PUBLISHED TILL FALL, BUT THE 
SCREEN RIGHTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN BOUGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An unpublished novel by Huntington Beach author Nina Vida has created a buzz 
in both New York and Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Weekly Variety, the Hollywood Reporter and Publishers Weekly all took notice 
of producer Richard Zanuck's recent option of Vida's "Goodbye Saigon," a 
mainstream novel set in Orange County's Little Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of two women -- one Vietnamese, the other Jewish -- who set up a law 
practice won't be published by Crown until the fall. But both Universal 
Pictures and Zanuck obtained copies of the manuscript shortly before 
Thanksgiving, and Zanuck ("Driving Miss Daisy") won the ensuing bidding war, 
securing an option for a reported low six figures against a mid-six-figure 
purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very exciting, and I'm very pleased, particularly that it was Zanuck, 
because he's such a thoughtful, serious movie-maker," says Vida, whose first 
novel, "Scam" -- a tale of love and greed in a Century City law office -- was 
published in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 In writing "Goodbye Saigon," Vida says she was "trying to talk about how a 
whole community, in effect, has been transplanted from Vietnam and how they 
have shown such resilience and survival instincts -- and that there's both good 
and bad in the community. I explore both sides: the violence as well as the 
good, the gangs as well as the successful professional business people. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have this tremendous dichotomy in the community, as do most communities. 
They're really not that unique, but they have their own specific problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The novel -- Vida's fourth -- is her first to be optioned by Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zanuck was in Sun Valley skiing and his scouts gave him the book," says Vida. 
"At the same time, Universal scouts gave them the book, and Universal wanted 
it. The auction started in the evening and by the next afternoon, Zanuck had 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 The independent producer, who has a development deal with MGM, is looking for 
a screenwriter and director. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very exciting," says Vida, who recently met with Zanuck for breakfast. 
"I'll probably be a consultant on the film because of my familiarity with the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Given the pre-publication buzz over the movie option, Vida is looking forward 
to the book's publication in the fall.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's going to be pretty hot," she says. "Crown is just jumping up and 
down, of course. One feeds off the other: If there's a movie deal, it excites 
book sales, and the book sales, of course, make interest in the movie."

 Editor's note: When the Fountain Valley High School Student Alliance, a gay 
support group, began meeting as a student organization in October, it triggered 
a public furor and demands that the group be banned from meeting at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of the controversy is an equal access policy, which makes it 
illegal to ban one group from meeting on campus during non-instructional time 
if another has been allowed to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Student opposition to the alliance is being led by the Future Good Boys of 
America, which has been given the same status as the alliance under the equal 
access policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huntington Beach Unified School District is scheduled to vote Tuesday on 
whether to continue the equal access policy. If eliminated, no student groups 
would be allowed to meet on campus for non-school related reasons.

 Several friends and I got together a few months ago to form the Fountain 
Valley Student Alliance, a support group for homosexual students. 
</P>
<P>
 We were officially allowed to meet on campus and have done so ever since. 
About 40 students, consisting of both homosexual and heterosexual students, 
meet weekly to support each other and discuss issues that are important to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 The group was formed to provide support for homosexual students, to educate 
others and to encourage tolerance and acceptance. The group is not about 
promoting homosexuality, it isn't even about sex; the group is about providing 
support in an atmosphere where support is hard to find. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is important in showing homosexual students that they are not alone. 
The alliance hopes to give students a place to go where they won't be judged.  
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, growing up gay is very difficult. Our group helps those students 
deal with the conflicts of being gay in a predominantly heterosexual world.  
</P>
<P>
 It is true that we, as students, are not 100% capable of solving every 
problem; we are not psychologists, nor do we claim to be. We know, however, 
that one of the most important things for high school students is to feel 
support and acceptance from their peers. This group also provides a place for 
other students to learn about differences in their fellow students. We want to 
promote tolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 It is disappointing to see people opposed to a group that seeks to help 
others. This opposition reveals the ignorance, misunderstanding and hatred in 
our community. Hopefully, the alliance will help eliminate this.  
</P>
<P>
 I hope that those opposed to us will realize that we are not a threat, and 
maybe one day we will help them too. 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance will continue to meet and do what we set out to do -- help 
students and build tolerance. This is a chance for all of us to reach out to 
one another and grow in our understanding and acceptance of individual 
differences, whether they be about sexuality, beliefs, race, color or anything 
else. And that, after all, is what this group is trying to accomplish.

FUELS ANTI-GAY SCHOOL PROTEST

students at Fountain Valley High School and members of the Future Good Boys of

 Homosexuality is a behavior that should not be condoned by our schools. 
Fountain Valley High School is one of the newest recipients of a support group 
that encourages the homosexual lifestyle. We must now ask, what are the true 
intentions of this support group? If this is just a support group, then why are 
they giving out phone numbers of militant gay organizations, such as ACT-UP, 
without parental knowledge or consent? 
</P>
<P>
 It is a preposterous concept that a school is condoning a chosen lifestyle 
that is extremely dangerous. Based on a study of obituaries in 17 homosexual 
publications by the Family Research Institute Inc., of Washington, D.C., the 
median age of death for a homosexual is the early 40s. 
</P>
<P>
 According to information gathered by the Oregon Citizens Alliance, a group 
opposed to minority status based on homosexuality, male homosexuals experience 
a higher rate of disease than the general population. It reports that 
homosexual males are 14 times more apt to experience syphilis, at a three times 
greater risk for genital warts, eight times more vulnerable to hepatitis and at 
a 5,000 times greater risk of contracting AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Coroner's office reported that in 1992 more than twice as 
many people died from AIDS than from gunshots. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 3,030 adult cases of AIDS reported in Orange County since 1986, 2,422 
of those cases were from male homosexual or bisexual contact, according to the 
Orange County Health Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Nicolosi, an Encino psychotherapist and author who believes 
psychotherapy can redirect sexual orientation, writes that "research constantly 
reveals great promiscuity and a strong emphasis on sexuality in gay 
relationships." 
</P>
<P>
 In California sodomy and oral copulation are still illegal for minors to 
engage in. There is a tendency for homosexual couples to engage in sodomy. 
Would our schools allow support groups that advocate other illegal practices, 
such as a drug abuse, underage drinking, graffiti, rape or child molestation? 
For one confused student to seek counsel from another confused student who is 
struggling with the same problem makes as much sense as an alcoholic asking a 
bartender why he shouldn't drink. 
</P>
<P>
 Our schools should not be permitted to advocate any type of lifestyle that 
does not teach students to practice abstinence, because there is absolutely no 
risk involved in that lifestyle. We should give parents back their right to 
teach their children about sex. A public institution such as a high school is 
not the place for such social engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a transgression against the moral principles of our country to tell the 
children of our high schools, who are at an impressionable age, that 
homosexuality is a healthy alternative lifestyle.
