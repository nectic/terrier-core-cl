 Stocks closed on a mixed note Friday, with the Dow Jones industrial average 
ending with a modest gain as Wall Street momentarily shrugged off its worries 
about the fiscal crisis in California's Orange County and fears of another 
interest rate hike. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds ended little changed while the dollar eased against the Japanese yen and 
German mark. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow rose 5.38 to 3,691.11, but posted a loss of 54.51 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street was still trying to gauge the fallout of Orange County's 
bankruptcy filing, Fidelity Investment's scrapping of the payout for its 
Magellan Fund and Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's comments hinting at 
future rate hikes, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those factors "have all combined to make for a pretty choppy environment," 
said Jack Shaughnessy, director of research at Advest. 
</P>
<P>
 The blue-chip average dropped as much as 28 points in the first hour, briefly 
recovering its losses before midday. The Dow retreated a second time and spent 
the afternoon posting modest losses, until computer-guided buy programs pushed 
it barely into positive territory in the last 30 minutes of trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the gain in the Dow, declining issues led advancers by about 13 to 9 
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume was relatively heavy at 336.54 
million shares, down from 362.78 million on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad-market indexes ended mixed. The NYSE's composite index rose 0.37 point 
to 244.17. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index added 1.51 points to 446.96. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Nasdaq composite index declined 0.07 point to 719.05. And the American 
Stock Exchange's market value index lost 2.15 points to 420.66. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the Treasury's 30-year bond yield fell to 7.85% from 7.87% 
on Thursday. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, was up 1/8 
point, or $1.25 per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal bonds also recovered some of their losses. The Bond Buyer index of 
40 actively traded municipal bonds, which finished at 83 28/32 the day after 
the bankruptcy filing, finished the week at 84 2/32, up 15/32 point from the 
day before. The average yield to maturity was 7.04%, down from 7.08% Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar closed in New York at 100.11 Japanese yen, down from 100.49 yen 
Thursday. It also closed at 1.5771 German marks, up from 1.5767. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Friday's highlights:  
</P>
<P>
 * Leading the Dow gainers was International Business Machines Corp., which 
added 1 1/4 to 71 1/2. Compaq Computer Corp. gained 1 to 40. Morgan Stanley 
Group Inc., which said Thursday it was in merger talks with S. G. Warburg 
Group, gained 2 7/8 to 58 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Semiconductor stocks rallied after the industry's book-to-bill ratio rose in 
November. Motorola Inc. advanced 1 3/4 to 55 3/8, Texas Instruments rose 1 5/8 
to 72 and National Semiconductor gained 1 to 18 3/8, although Intel Corp. ended 
flat at 62 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some health maintenance organization stocks also firmed after a two-session 
bashing on worries thatpremiums may decline next year. Oxford Health Plans 
jumped 4 3/4 to 74 1/4 and Humana Inc. gained 5/8 to 19 1/8. But U.S. 
Healthcare Inc. slipped 1/8 to 39 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Railroad stocks fell after Morgan Stanley downgraded six railroad companies to 
"hold" from "buy," noting they have doubled in price since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 * Burlington Northern fell 1 1/2 to 49, Conrail fell 3/4 to 49 3/4 and CSX 
Corp. fell 1/2 to 64 3/4. Norfolk Southern dropped 5/8 to 61 1/4 while Santa Fe 
Pacific eased 1/8 to 16 5/8 and Union Pacific fell 3/8 to 44 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Footwear maker Timberland Co. sank 4 3/8 to 22 7/8 after saying sales have 
not kept pace with its aggressive outlook and it expects 1994 earnings per 
share to be below last year's results. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas stock markets followed Wall Street lower. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index 
crashed through two support levels to end down 279.24 points at 7,789.07, a new 
closing low for the year. In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225-share average, reacting to 
Hong Kong's plunge, fell 201.74 points to 18,978.30. Mexico City's Bolsa's 
37-share IPC index was down 32.11 points at 2,467.79 points. 
</P>
<P>
 London's Financial Times 100-share average also reacted to Wall Street's 
weakness and closed 36.5 points lower at 2,977.3.

MUSIC REVIEW; L.A. CHAMBER CONCERTMASTER SHINES IN CONDUCTING DEBUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four seasons and a few days ago, violinist Iona Brown led the Los Angeles 
Chamber Orchestra in a memorable, hugely expressive performance of Vivaldi's 
"Le Quattro Stagioni." 
</P>
<P>
 For his debut as guest director with the orchestra, Thursday night at 
Ambassador Auditorium, concertmaster Ralph Morrison dared the same work, 
leading a memorable, tautly expressive performance.What a difference an adverb 
makes. 
</P>
<P>
 Where Brown had offered fierce virtuosity, steely brilliance and swooning, 
over-the-top poetry, Morrison showed himself the sweet-toned, never forcing 
classicist who painted scenes with exact, focused brush strokes and tightly 
sculpted phrasings, an M.C. Escher, say, to Brown's Delacroix. 
</P>
<P>
 In his beautifully polished and dashing account, Morrison could find dainty 
and delicate lines while avoiding any hint of preciousness thanks to the firm 
rhythmic backbone driving the work, the music lean and springy of step. The big 
tutti sections had plenty of verve and tension. Morrison appeared able to 
concentrate almost solely on his soloing, LACO's accompaniment needing little 
fuss, yet sensitively, precisely rendered. 
</P>
<P>
 The first half of Morrison's debut, in music of Bach, wasn't quite as stellar. 
In both the "Brandenburg" Concerto No. 5 -- with solid contributions from 
harpsichordist Patricia Mabee and flutist David Shostac -- and the Concerto for 
Violin and Oboe, BWV 1060, with a pungent, elegant offering from Allan Vogel, 
soloist Morrison seemed too unselfish, often lost in the action. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Brandenburg" Concerto No. 3 hopped merrily along though, and with only 11 
players, the inner parts -- especially some fine work from the trio of violists 
-- were wonderfully heard. TIMOTHY MANGAN

DANCE REVIEWS; A 'JAZZ ON TAP' SHOWCASE AT WADSWORTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEWIS SEGAL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With his wild, windmill arms and firecracker bursts of energy, Van Porter 
brings an unpredictable contemporary edge to tap dancing -- and to the 
curiously sedate "Jazz on Tap" revue that opened Thursday at the Wadsworth 
Theater in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 A student of Maceo Anderson (one of the original Four Step Brothers), Porter 
can keep the sound of his tapping scratchy and loose: sand-dancing without the 
sand. 
</P>
<P>
 But he can also drum the stage powerfully with his feet, making the whole 
theater reverberate with assaultive kick-rhythms. One moment, he's all 
toe-taps, the next all heels. He may venture dazzling traveling passages, yet 
will look just as comfortable at tight, in-place tapping. 
</P>
<P>
 But never for long. Restless and impulsive, Porter's an artist specializing in 
short-term sensation, and nobody else on the program comes close to his range, 
flash and dynamism -- except maybe Germaine Ingram, who displays a startling 
feral attack in her dancing, along with speed and dexterity enough to match 
perfectly the footwork of her partner, the distinguished old smoothie LaVaughn 
Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides helping to host "Jazz on Tap," Dianne Walker performs solos 
spotlighting the exemplary steadiness of her technique and, most remarkably, 
perhaps, the soft, buoyant quality she can explore without missing a beat. All 
the women on the program wear pants and flat shoes, but this is dancing of 
flowing, luxuriant femininity. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Wayne Doba emphasizes the comic effect of furious, hard-sell 
tapping accompanied by the wrong music -- or no music at all. It's an 
overextended, one-joke act, but executed with plenty of skill. 
</P>
<P>
 Artists from locally based ensembles present familiar solos, with Fred 
Strickler (Rhapsody in Taps) looking highly accomplished in his "Don't Get 
Around Much Any More" mood piece and Dormeshia Sumbry (Jazz Tap Ensemble) 
offering her bouncy Bill Robinson tribute. Jazz Tap Ensemble virtuoso Derick 
Grant demonstrates his potent throwaway style in both "Another You" and a duet 
with Sumbry. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, with their granddad Fayard Nicholas in attendance, the two Nicholas 
Sisters (ages 6 and 9) claim tap traditions for a new generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Master tapper/choreographer Cholly Atkins serves as artistic director and 
co-host for the event, which also features the sophisticated musicianship of 
Gildo Mahones, John Simon and Fritz Wise. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Jazz on Tap" receives its final performance at 8 p.m. tonight in the 
Wadsworth Theater, Veterans Administration grounds, Westwood. (310) 825-2101. 
Tickets: $9 (students) to $28. LEWIS SEGAL

DANCE REVIEWS; CHRISTENSEN TROUPE ENTERS 'MACHINE' AGE AT LATC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER FISHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was no music in four of the five short works called "Machine" by 
Christensen Dance Company on Thursday night at the Los Angeles Theatre Center. 
Replacing it was a steady sound scape of dancers' breathing -- panting, grunts 
of exhaustion and pronounced exhalations. 
</P>
<P>
 Fatigue-as-accompaniment made sense in Joel Christensen's earlier pieces on 
the program -- the task-oriented "Blocks," and his solos "Boing" or "Tired," in 
which he frolics among tires he constantly rearranges. But in two new 
low-impact pieces, the often evenly paced and light physical efforts of the 
dancers (Christensen, Caroline Aizawa, Maryann Thomson and William Schurmann) 
didn't seem to warrant that amount of audible exhaustion. 
</P>
<P>
 The mood of "Kinetics," for instance, was more that of a warm-up, with dancers 
in pale spandex unitards tracing their own phrases, swiveling arms and hips as 
if to limber up. Keeping a casual rhythmic connection to four or five 
metronomes around the stage, they fell into partial unison and stopped in erect 
poses with angled arms and tilted flat palms. 
</P>
<P>
 Poses recurred with more regularity in "100" when a similar kind of noodling 
was alternated with a series (or fragments) of 100 classroom-like poses, called 
out by each dancer as performed.  
</P>
<P>
 It was hard to decipher a mood in these two works, which are definitely not in 
the hyperdance realm. The loose, detached, almost mechanical style and evenly 
spaced groupings were reminiscent of Merce Cunningham, without his attention to 
formal detail or the technical precision of his dancers. Christensen's 
combinations of everyday movement and jazzy or balletic modern dance aligns him 
with any number of postmodern dance-makers,  
</P>
<P>
 Technical glitches and an under-rehearsed look to group pieces didn't help, 
but Christensen's larger assignment is to give his company something more to 
breathe hard about. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Machine," performed by the Christensen Dance Co., Lo Angeles Theatre 
Center, 514 S. Spring St., downtown, tonight, 8 p.m., $8. (213) 485-1631.

THEATER REVIEW; 'INSPECTING CAROL' RIGHT ON TARGET WITH TWISTS AND WIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are very few plays that can put you in stitches and make you laugh till 
you cry. "Inspecting Carol," a backstage Christmas farce at the Moulton 
Theater, does both. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh, topical and outrageously funny, this Laguna Playhouse production will 
have you laughing out loud in the first act and wiping away the tears in the 
second.  
</P>
<P>
 The chief target of this savvy lampoon is not just those boilerplate stagings 
of "A Christmas Carol" that take over almost all our theaters at this time of 
year, but the whole fabric of pious customs entrenched in American theatrical 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Written by Daniel Sullivan and members of the nationally recognized Seattle 
Repertory Theatre (where Sullivan is artistic director), "Inspecting Carol" 
gives us a glimpse of a down-at-the-heels drama troupe that has lost half its 
subscribers and is trying to hang on to the rest with its 13th annual offering 
of the Dickens classic. 
</P>
<P>
 The plot depends on a nicely turned case of mistaken identity lifted in spirit 
from Gogol's "The Government Inspector": An amateur actor shows up out of the 
blue looking to audition for a role, any role, and wrongly is assumed to be a 
bureaucrat from the National Endowment for the Arts who has arrived incognito 
to evaluate the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Desperate to save the NEA grant, which is the only thing that stands between 
the company and financial collapse, the director tries to ingratiate herself by 
casting him in the play. Soon the rest of the troupe is fawning over him as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 For all its comic exaggeration, Sullivan's script has the ring of truth about 
the state of regional theater around the country. And this production, billed 
as a Southern California premiere, delivers the goods with a marvelous brand of 
burlesque that is hip but not sneering and absurd without being unreal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Multiculturalism, political correctness and the NEA all come in for a gentle 
bashing. So do racial stereotyping, minority tokenism and the scads of abject 
grantees that depend on the NEA's goodwill. Anyone who wants to celebrate the 
season with a satirical Yuletide show instead of a dutiful one ought to rush 
right over to the Moulton. 
</P>
<P>
 The bravura staging by Andrew Barnicle takes big risks going over the top and 
never misses. The well-cast ensemble responds with thoroughbred performances 
depicting a motley collection of recognizable types that are hugely 
entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Shelton lays much of the groundwork with a sharp portrait of the company's 
unctuous business manager. John Serembe, as the crackpot star of the troupe, 
adds a high comic sheen to the sendup with his take-charge Scrooge, who has a 
predilection for last-minute, socially relevant rewrites that drive the rest of 
the cast crazy.  
</P>
<P>
 Then there are Shannon McCleerey as the deadpan stage manager, Linda Bisesti 
as the self-dramatizing director and Andy Hedden as the mistaken NEA official 
who manages to transform every role he plays (including Tiny Tim) into the evil 
hunchback from Shakespeare's "Richard III." 
</P>
<P>
 Teri Ciranna offers a strong supporting performance as the troupe's resident 
Brit who, in a bit of reverse English, affects a Brooklyn accent. Jim McElenney 
is a walking gag of rattling chains, and Kyle Jones, who looks truly dumbstruck 
playing a young actor on stage for the first time, gets some of the evening's 
biggest laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 Technically, the show is a gem; play and production seem brilliantly matched. 
All the design elements are first-rate, from the detailed auditorium setting 
and purposely flimsy scenery to the cartoonish props, rich costumes and 
exemplary lighting. The set itself gets into the act in hilarious ways that 
will surprise you. 
</P>
<P>
 "Inspecting Carol" is hands down the funniest show I've seen all year. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Inspecting Carol," Moulton Theater, 606 Laguna Canyon Road, Laguna Beach. 
Tuesdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m.; Saturday and Sunday matinees at 2. 
Ends Dec. 18. $17-$22. (714) 494-8021. Running time: 2 hours.

POP ALBUM CHART; KENNY G FACING A 'VITALOGY' JAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kenny G's two-week run on top of the chart with "Miracles: The Holiday Album" 
will come to a halt when Pearl Jam's "Vitalogy" CD debuts next week--a lock to 
hit No. 1. The vinyl version came out two weeks ago and dropped to No. 173 
after a startling--for a vinyl release--No. 55 entry last week. Things are 
looking blue for Prince's "Black Album," which came on the chart at a modest 
No. 47 and then plummeted to No. 68. TLC's "CrazySexyCool" (No. 15) is shaping 
up as the most solid hit among the recent rap/soul releases. The trio's hit 
single, "Creep"--No. 5 on the pop chart--is driving album sales. Ini Kamoze's 
single "Here Comes the Hotstepper" moved up a notch to the top of the chart, 
dropping Boyz II Men's "On Bended Knee" to No. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't bury "Bedtime Stories" just yet. Some had already written it off as a 
flop because it's been sliding down the chart since its lofty debut at No. 3 
six weeks ago. But Madonna's hot new single, "Take a Bow," is pumping life back 
into the album, which bounced back up the chart from No. 33 to No. 24.

POP MUSIC REVIEWS; DREAM THEATER REALLY SHOULD DREAM ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dream Theater was the serendipitous name of the opening night headliner 
Thursday at the Galaxy Concert Theatre; you could hardly dream up a better 
venue than this spacious, comfortable, 550-seat club, a new acquisition by Gary 
Folgner, who also owns the well-established Coach House and the Ventura 
Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there wasn't much besides the name to make Dream Theater a fitting 
opening-night attraction.The band, originally formed at Boston's Berklee 
College of Music, combined bombastic progressive rock influenced by Yes and 
Emerson, Lake & Palmer with gargantuan heavy metal a la Queensryche.  
</P>
<P>
 That's a fairly dubious premise to start with, and Dream Theater accentuated 
the worst excesses of both styles. Yes and ELP may have had their foolish and 
pretentious moments (well, a lot of them, actually), but they offered pop 
melody along with progressive flash, and both could perform with delightful 
panache and a showmanly flair that Dream Theater utterly lacked. 
</P>
<P>
 The four instrumentalists in a lineup of guitar, bass, keyboards and drums 
devoted their considerable technical ability to music that had little purpose 
except to show off, while singer James LaBrie inflicted the worst sort of 
bleating operatic heavy metal vocal excess. Memorable melodies were few; 
emotional content was thin. Handy labels aside, there was nothing progressive 
about it. MIKE BOEHM

TV REVIEWS; ALASKA ADVENTURE IN 'RUGGED GOLD' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNNE HEFFLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A refined widow remarries, moves to Alaska and braves grizzlies, earthquakes, 
injuries, unattended childbirth and outdoor plumbing. For all its eventfulness, 
however, the adventure never catches fire in "Rugged Gold," a treacly, '50s-era 
Jill Eikenberry vehicle tonight on the Family Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 When socialite Martha (Eikenberry) marries gold prospector Don (Art Hindle), 
she and her young son Lloyd move with him to his no-frills cabin in the Alaskan 
wilderness. Challenges include Don's rude-but-with-a-heart-of-gold partner Sam 
(Graham Greene), overcoming the shock of seeing animals killed for food, 
learning to shoot and Lloyd's slow adjustment to his stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
 As Don, Hindle spends too much time looking amused at Martha's expense, and 
Greene is a caricature grouch. Eikenberry, who brings a genuine sweetness to 
the role and admirably eschews vanity, is working against the show's "Perils of 
Pauline" feel and the self-conscious heroism in Martha's cloying, 
after-the-fact narrative. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah James' Harlequin romance-style script, directed by Michael Anderson, is 
based on Martha Martin's autobiographical novel, "O Rugged Gold." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Rugged Gold" premieres at 8 tonight on cable's Family Channel.

TV REVIEWS; 'WORLD OF DISNEY' PROMOTES NOSTALGIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE MARGULIES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You wouldn't be off the mark in complaining about the self-serving nature of a 
TV program produced by the Walt Disney studio that pays tribute to the Walt 
Disney studio. 
</P>
<P>
 You would, however, be a tad late -- by exactly the same four decades covered 
in tonight's "The Wonderful World of Disney: 40 Years of Television Magic." 
</P>
<P>
 The first Disney TV series in 1954, after all, was called "Disneyland" and, as 
we are reminded in clips tonight, featured regular updates on progress at the 
Anaheim theme park that was then under construction. Indeed, it was in exchange 
for ABC investing in the park that Disney agreed to go into the television 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 So, among the many things about which Walt Disney was a visionary -- and they 
were many, as the program reminds us, from family entertainment to technology 
to space exploration -- was corporate synergy. Even in the first season of 
"Disneyland," the studio produced one of those now-common promotional 
documentaries about the making of its theatrical film "20,000 Leagues Under the 
Sea" -- and won an Emmy for it, beating "Twelve Angry Men" as best program of 
the year! 
</P>
<P>
 As infomercials go, however, tonight's program does have its nostalgic value, 
with memorable clips from "Davy Crockett," "Zorro," "The Mickey Mouse Club" and 
the early "Disneyland" space programs and nature documentaries, plus other 
assorted TV ventures (and some non-TV ones too, in what feels like padding to 
cover two hours). 
</P>
<P>
 And, for those of us who are a lot more cynical about TV now than we were back 
then, there's fun to be had counting the subtle plugs for other Disney 
products: "The Lion King" (and its soundtrack), the coming Indiana Jones ride 
at Disneyland, Margaret Cho, who stars in the Disney-produced ABC series 
"All-American Girl." . . . You've got to admire what 40 years of honing these 
cross-promotional skills have produced. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Wonderful World of Disney: 40 Years of Television Magic" airs at 8 
tonight on ABC (Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42). LEE MARGULIES

TV REVIEWS; 'WITCH HUNT' A BURNING HOLLYWOOD SATIRE; HBO'S 'WITCH HUNT' IS A 
BURNING SATIRE ON HOLLYWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a withering satire of the Red scare in Hollywood, "Witch Hunt" is a 
stinging comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 But this HBO movie, stylishly directed by Paul Schrader, is much more: a 
timeless parody, a film noir mystery, a wicked commentary on the star factory 
and a visual valentine to 1950's architecture and pill box hats. 
</P>
<P>
 Featuring Dennis Hopper as a droll gumshoe, Penelope Ann Miller as a sexy 
starlet and Eric Bogosian as a Sen. Joe McCarthy-like zealot who rolls into 
Hollywood to sweep out the vermin and nail a scapegoat for the country's ills, 
this TV movie is a consummate hoot. 
</P>
<P>
 Writer Joseph Dougherty's spin on Hollywood is fresh because it dramatizes 
Hollywood magic as real, not merely a metaphor. Hollywood literally is the 
Magic Castle. Every sleight-of-hand character in town is a genuine witch or 
sorcerer. People can brew coffee with a wave of a hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopper's private eye is billeted down the hall from a friendly coven. He's 
hired by a stenographer-turned-actress (Miller) to find out whether her 
husband, a studio executive, is cheating on her. The husband turns up dead, and 
soon Hopper finds himself immersed in the senator's full-blown witch hunt to 
stamp out sorcery and save American values. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie's special visual effects are jaw-dropping by TV standards. 
Cigarettes turn into snakes, black crows fly out of human mouths, scissors whir 
around rooms, women's bodies are artificially enhanced -- all of it grist for 
Bogosian's charismatic, larcenous Sen. Larson Crockett and his Congressional 
Committee on Unnatural Activities. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lighter departure for director Schrader (who wrote "Taxi Driver" and 
helmed "Cat People"), the shadow of the Hollywood blacklist is implicit, not 
intrusive. Heretofore too painful for comedic treatment, Hollywood's nightmare 
years might be totally missed by viewers oblivious to history but otherwise 
caught up in a pop-art mystery. * "Witch Hunt" premieres at 8 tonight on HBO.  
</P>
<P>
 'Reunion's' Potency Is Thomas' Acting 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Grant may have cooled down her number of screen appearances the last few 
years, but she's certainly kept active as a director. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Reunion," airing on CBS Sunday, her direction of Marlo Thomas' grieving 
mother is as crucial to that movie as her shaping of Ann-Margret's liberated 
widow was in "Following Her Heart" on NBC two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In each instance, Grant salvaged a sudsy woman's story by eliciting an 
affecting female performance that rises above the material. Thomas' character, 
who communes with a ghost, is an especially tough role. 
</P>
<P>
 For that matter, so is Peter Strauss' quietly dependable husband, a 
deceptively solid performance (much like his farmer in "The Yearling" last 
year). But, curiously, as a financially out-of-pocket farmer, his lovely 
farmhouse and lakeside spread is so Norman Rockwell-sublime it might adorn a 
Christmas calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas is credible under psychological circumstances that the production, with 
much murky, moody lighting, is hard put to sustain. She plays a New England 
farm wife and amateur painter whose cozy world is shattered when one of her 
5-year-old twins accidentally chokes to death. 
</P>
<P>
 While others in the family (including Frances Sternhagen's live-in 
mother-in-law) come to grips with the death, the mother's grief turns obsessive 
and she begins to see the dead child in apparitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the novel "Points of Light" by Linda Gray Sexton, the adaptation (by 
Ronald Bass and John Pielmeier) fully exploits the terrifying choice the mother 
must finally make between an invitation to death and the will to live. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Reunion" airs at 9 p.m. Sunday on CBS (Channels 2 and 8).

SHOULD ROSEANNE'S BENEFIT ACT HAVE BEEN REVIEWED? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am writing to express my disappointment over The Times' critique of 
Roseanne, who performed at our Feminist Majority Foundation benefit ("A Rose Is 
a Rose, but Not Roseanne," Nov. 19). 
</P>
<P>
 The show was an important fund-raiser for our National Clinic Defense Project, 
which works to protect doctors and health-care workers nationwide from 
anti-abortion violence.Roseanne graciously came out to support us, as did all 
the comics who so generously donated their time and talent. 
</P>
<P>
 The show was a benefit, a one-time performance, not the beginning of a tour 
for Roseanne and certainly not appropriate for a review. Roseanne came to our 
event after a 14-hour shoot. That she was concerned enough about anti-abortion 
violence to appear at our show is a big statement about the clinic-violence 
crisis we face and the kind of person Roseanne is. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of people found Roseanne shocking, but, then, women around the world 
live a shocking reality. Humor -- when used to raise consciousness about 
injustice and discrimination -- is not always funny. 
</P>
<P>
 Our contributors and supporters may express their own opinions about 
Roseanne's performance, but because of the nature of our event -- a benefit 
show -- The Times should not.

CAB CALLOWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a New York publicist in the '40s and '50s, I was fortunate to represent a 
number of the great talents of the musical world, including Cab Calloway. 
</P>
<P>
 I handled Calloway's publicity at a time when he was in a popularity decline, 
and my most vivid memory of that association was the time "I gave him away" as 
a prize on the TV quiz show "Stop the Music." He had just returned from a 
disastrous engagement in a Philadelphia nightclub, where business had been 
terrible, when I proposed that he needed more exposure on the new electronic 
medium -- television. Unlike some clients, Calloway listened and cooperated. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, "Stop the Music" was one of the most popular programs on TV, 
giving away prizes on the telephone to people who could correctly identify the 
name of a song the orchestra was playing. I proposed to the producers that 
instead of merchandise, they "give away" Calloway and the band for one night. 
(Calloway and the band, of course, were to perform on the TV program each week 
until there was a winner.) Calloway readily agreed. So did the producers. 
</P>
<P>
 After about three or four weeks of national exposure on "Stop the Music," the 
winners were an elderly couple in Providence, R.I. They had the band and 
Calloway play at a benefit dance for their church, but first we had him and the 
band perform at the couple's tiny home, seated on cases of canned foods, 
appliances and other items. 
</P>
<P>
 A month later the Calloway band returned to that club in Philadelphia -- and 
the club filled so quickly that it was full and the ropes were up nightly by 9. 
</P>
<P>
 I can say, without hesitation, that he was a wonderful man and a delight as a 
client. I already miss him.

'HOW TO SUCCEED' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Having just seen "How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying" in La 
Jolla (" 'How to Succeed' in High-Tech," Nov. 26), I thought I'd respond to 
lighting designer Howell Binkley's assessment of the show's technology, that 
"audiences love it." 
</P>
<P>
 The photo by Ken Howard accompanying The Times' article is a fair one: That is 
what the whole show looks like.Once I realized that we were never going to get 
out from under that set, the increasing claustrophobia I felt began to drain 
any sense of fun the show had to give. 
</P>
<P>
 The video-screen display at the back of the stage -- separated as it is by the 
oppressive set design -- creates the weird sense of being archaic even when it 
has never been done before. At the very least, Des McAnuff's "Tommy" was never 
stuck in a single visual image. 
</P>
<P>
 It was amusing to read Linda Batwin's defense of the video images at the 
beginning of Megan Mullally's big number. By the time the 31 seconds of 
graphics are over and you can once again focus on the singer and the song, 
you've lost the thread of it (which is particularly distressful as Mullally is 
one of the show's few high points). 
</P>
<P>
 With all this emphasis on technology in an enterprise that is basically human, 
you inevitably begin to smell failure.

ONLY IN L.A.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quiz show: During a preliminary hearing in a robbery case, one of the victims 
testified that she had helped the L.A. County Sheriff's Department prepare a 
composite drawing of her assailant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me ask you the $64,000 question," defense attorney Anthony Brooklier 
asked her. "Does it look like the defendant?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," she responded, then added: "I want the prize." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe this matter should be turned over to Judge Wapner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Which reminds us: One wonders how many prisoners leaving L.A. County Jail over 
the last couple of months have done a double take upon seeing a newspaper stand 
that contains the Sept. 27 issue of USA Today's Baseball Weekly. That issue 
shows a photo of slugger Ken Griffey Jr. and tells how the strike deprived him 
of a chance to break a home run record. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's the headline that really stands out, considering the setting: "YOU 
WERE ROBBED!" 
</P>
<P>
 Auditioning for Judge Ito: The producers of "Gotta Sing!" -- a TV show that 
invites viewers to perform -- thoughtfully donated a tape to L.A. County 
Superior Court for the listening pleasure of the O.J. Simpson jury. It's too 
soon to tell whether the tape will be played. We might add, though, that in the 
context of a murder trial, the phrase "Gotta Sing" might have an unintended 
double meaning.

 The man of someone else's dreams: As they shared a bottle of wine in a 
Downtown restaurant, a woman said to a friend: "I hope I get married some day 
and can be as happy as you and Jim. I can't believe I just turned 30." 
</P>
<P>
 Friend: "I'm sure you'll find someone." 
</P>
<P>
 Single woman: "I dunno. Ever since Greg and I broke up. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Friend: "Greg! That lowlife." 
</P>
<P>
 (They laugh.) 
</P>
<P>
 Single woman: "Here's a weird story. My aunt told me she dreamed that my 
future husband knocked on her front door. But she couldn't see who it was, 
except that he was handsome and wore a suit." 
</P>
<P>
 Friend: "That doesn't narrow it down much." 
</P>
<P>
 Single woman: "He does look good in a suit." 
</P>
<P>
 Friend: "Who?"

<P>
 Single woman: "Greg."

 Ark, the herald angels sing!Joey Awaida, a 5-year-old kindergarten pupil,

<P>
 Young Joey informed his teacher, Irl Noble: "There's the boat that God put the 
animals in by twos." miscelLAny Earlier this century, there were no ticket 
scalpers in Pasadena on New Year's Day. That's because, as "California 
Dreaming" by Jim Rawls notes, the Jan. 1 football game was discontinued from 
1903 until 1916 "in favor of Roman-style chariot races, ostrich races and even 
an elephant vs. camel race. (The elephant won, by the way.)"

 * The summary of the problems affecting the Edutrain Charter School in Los 
Angeles (Nov. 28) points up a historical failure in public school reform.You 
can't simply take energetic, committed professionals and throw them into an 
entrepreneurial context without a massive investment in training them for this 
new culture.  
</P>
<P>
 The singular distinction in the LEARN plan among all reforms in the country is 
the belief and practice that investing in the school community's training 
yields high dividends.

 It is such a tragedy to see the promise of Edutrain for so many lost youth 
become a casualty that could have been avoided.

AGAIN, THE SCOOPER COMES ON STRONG; DESPITE HIGH WINDS, THE WATER-DUMPING 
PLANES PERFORM WELL IN MALIBU BRUSH FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A strong performance by two "Super Scoopers" in combatting a fast-moving 
Malibu brush fire Thursday, amid dangerous wind, again shows that Los Angeles 
County's leasing of the two Canadian-built planes is money well spent.  
</P>
<P>
 Use of the CL-215s for the fire season is setting the county back about 
$719,000 (which includes two crews and mechanics), plus $550 for every hour in 
the air. However, relieved Malibu residents would surely agree the price is 
right. So, too, would some residents of the City of Industry, where last month 
the amphibious planes helped knock down flames that threatened homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles has been fortunate this year. Because of favorable weather, 
including early rainfall, firefighters have had fewer big blazes to combat. In 
1993, fire charred 17,000 acres and destroyed 323 homes in Malibu. 
Conflagrations also devastated Altadena and Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 For a time Thursday, 50-m.p.h. gusts threatened to create another inferno. 
However, a swift response by firefighters, aided by seven water-dropping 
helicopters and the Super Scoopers, spared as many as 50 homes in the area of 
Pacific Coast Highway and Latigo Canyon Road.  
</P>
<P>
 Critics point out that strong winds forced the water-dumping planes to higher 
altitudes, preventing them from scoring direct hits on the advancing flames. 
While this is true, fire experts point out the aircraft still played a key role 
in the early stages of the brush fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, firefighting equipment has its limitations, especially in rugged 
terrain. As any pilot will attest, gusting winds hamper fixed-wing aircraft, 
the CL-215 included. Even so, these water-gulping planes have demonstrated 
their capability in fighting fires for more than two decades in Canada and 
California. When public officials had the courage to spend money on the 
technology, they have not been disappointed. The L.A. County Board of 
Supervisors made the right choice this fire season. Sounds like a plan.

SHE PULLED NO PUNCHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dr. Joycelyn Elders, until Friday the surgeon general of the United States, 
was always a political lightning rod, unafraid to speak her mind. When 
President Clinton appointed her, that was her virtue. Two years and a GOP 
landslide midterm election later, it was her undoing. The President sacked her 
after hearing of her suggestion that kids be taught about masturbation in 
school. That remark, combined with her previous strong words about drug 
legalization and her outspoken endorsement of homosexuals' adoption of 
children, was just too much political freight for this Administration, or 
perhaps any, to carry. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that her outspoken stands lacked all logic. On the contrary, many 
thoughtful people advocate drug legalization; the controversial practice of 
homosexual adoption does have its supporters; and Elder's comments on 
masturbation, made at a New York conference on AIDS, came in response to a 
question about whether masturbation might be a way of discouraging school-age 
children from much riskier forms of sexual activity. 
</P>
<P>
 But Elders had become too tempting a target for America's political right, and 
in some ways perhaps too willing a one. The eldest of eight children, a child 
of poverty who never saw a physician before she entered college and a 
determined medical student who went on to become a respected pediatrician and 
then director of the Arkansas Department of Health, Dr. Elders was unwilling to 
abandon her uncompromising views, unwilling when she went to Washington to talk 
in the vague generalities of the diplomat. 
</P>
<P>
 She was also a woman of vision and caring, and if she violated Washington's 
informal three-controversies-and-you're-out rule, she was, like her 
distinguished predecessor, C. Everett Koop, willing to talk straight to the 
people about the real issues of health and medicine. And for this virtue, she 
deserves, as did the Reagan-appointed Koop, the gratitude of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 We hope her successor, too, will speak out. Health issues are too important 
for top officials to be always pulling their punches.

TOO COZY A RELATIONSHIP?; WALL STREET AND ORANGE COUNTY: THE LOVE AFFAIR THAT 
SOURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Was Wall Street peddling risky securities to a vulnerable Orange County, much 
like a drug dealer feeding the habit of an addled junkie? Or was the county a 
wide-awake participant in its own undoing, fumbling with strategies that 
require savvy and flexible investing? 
</P>
<P>
 It may be that it was a little of each. Either way, the issue of whether 
investment houses have a fiduciary responsibility for Orange County's 
bankruptcy is likely to end up in the courts. There is precedent for finding 
such accountability; however, the enormity of the Orange County debacle ought 
to prompt more than a settling of accounts. It should result in new thinking 
about oversight of public investments made by public officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch reportedly earned about $80 million in fees and commissions in 
dealing with the go-for-broke investment pool of now-resigned Orange County 
Treasurer Robert L. Citron. Over the years, Merrill Lynch lobbied for 
liberalizing state legislation to make such investments possible, and it 
contributed generously to political campaigns. Now the Securities and Exchange 
Commission wants to know whether there were any misrepresentations connected 
with the fund. The state Department of Corporations is looking for possible 
violation of state law in the county's relationship with Merrill Lynch.  
</P>
<P>
 Did investment houses exploit cozy relationships with municipalities to lure 
them into unwise investments? A 1993 Orange County ordinance was broadly aimed 
at curbing gifts to county officials not just from bankers but from developers 
and the like, precisely to discourage the luring of officials down the primrose 
path. But a few Lakers tickets or other small gifts do not make for the kind of 
colossal failure in oversight now evident in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 In its defense, Merrill Lynch says in effect that the people at the Hall of 
Administration in Santa Ana were grown-ups and ought to have known what they 
were getting into. Maybe, but did the New York-based brokerage firm fully 
disclose all the exposure, and make prudent investment suggestions? 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, most taxpayers would agree that their money managers, and those 
looking over their shoulders, ought to know what they are embarking on. Yet 
without any oversight from other county officials, Citron had a free rein and 
became a favored customer of Merrill's Fannie Mae securities. The county was 
the sole purchaser of a $800-million issue being investigated by the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, having greased the legislative wheels and courted Orange County 
officials with Christmas gifts in earlier years, some firms retreated by 
dumping nearly $9 billion in bonds being held as collateral on loans. That 
ought to be sufficient evidence that the carefully cultivated relationships 
underlying these huge deals were of the flimsy, fair-weather sort, bonded only 
by bottom-line returns on investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, Orange County looked more vulnerable than anyone had imagined 
possible. Whatever Wall Street's role was in this disaster, the experience 
suggests a need for better disclosure requirements on investment funds 
involving public money, and better monitoring of money managers by the public's 
trustees in city halls. Without that, the taxpayer is alone with the wolves.

SIRHAN SIRHAN PAROLE HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The brief Associated Press story about the denial of parole to Sirhan Sirhan 
on Dec. 1 (Dec. 2), leaves out the most interesting events at the parole 
hearing, which was broadcast live by Court TV. As Sirhan's attorney, I pointed 
out some important facts about the evidence. According to the Robert Kennedy 
autopsy report, the assassination weapon's muzzle was one inch away from 
Kennedy's fatal head wound. 
</P>
<P>
 At trial, the coroner testified that the gun was somewhere between being in 
actual physical contact with Kennedy and being one inch away from him as to the 
other two wounds he suffered. However, eyewitnesses have placed Sirhan's gun at 
between 1.5 feet and five feet away from Kennedy, nowhere near close enough for 
Sirhan to have shot him. Also, Kennedy was shot from behind, but trial 
witnesses placed Sirhan in front of Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, as I mentioned in a post-hearing interview with Court TV, FBI 
photographs showing bullet holes in the pantry door confirm that the number of 
bullets fired in the pantry exceeded the capacity of Sirhan's revolver. This 
shows that someone else actually shot Kennedy and that Sirhan is serving a 
sentence for a homicide which, in light of his position, was impossible for him 
to commit himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, the jury that convicted Sirhan was never asked to consider these 
critical facts. The jury was told by Sirhan's lawyers at the time that his 
guilt as the assassin was conceded and that the only issue they need consider 
was his state of mind. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, a member of the Board of Prison Terms explained the decision to deny 
Sirhan parole at that time by noting that "the underlying causes of the crime 
and the prisoner's role in the assassination remain unresolved and a longer 
period of time is needed to resolve these issues." While I disagree that this 
is a valid reason for denying parole, Sirhan's role as Kennedy's assassin, 
though widely accepted as gospel, was never proven and is in fact highly 
doubtful in light of contrary evidence briefly mentioned above.

ASSISTANCE FOR STREET YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many homeless youth, runaways, throwaways and street gangs are involved in 
more than just survival behaviors on the streets of Los Angeles. Sadly enough, 
unspeakable crimes and violations of people do occur, like the murder reported 
in "2 Arrested in Torture Slaying of Transient" (Nov. 30). What must be 
remembered is that in a time when racism, violence and fear haunt us all, not 
everyone within the street population is evil. The crimes reported in your 
article are despicably evil and in no way can be tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
 All of us need to remember that there are serious issues that have been left 
unaddressed regarding the street population. It is vital that we who are in 
positions to make a difference move beyond debating mere issues of 
incarceration lengths of stay for violent crimes. Short-term emergency shelter 
and outpatient programs without permanent client stabilization can only begin 
to help. Recovery, rehabilitation and mental health care beyond these programs 
need to be the primary focus of our energies and discussions.  
</P>
<P>
 It is important that as we refer to street people we know who we are talking 
about as a community. There are differences in street behaviors, ages and moral 
codes among all the populations we lump together. Runaways are young people who 
have left home in many cases because it was intolerable. Throwaway youth have 
been abandoned for such reasons as poverty and gender-identity issues. Homeless 
youth are mostly those ages 18-23 who have tried to make it in school, work 
and/or the military and failed. Youth street gangs are made up of young people 
from each of the populations named above but who feel a need to be part of a 
group. They must be dealt with through gang-related community services. 
</P>
<P>
 It is impossible for drop-in centers and shelters to effectively manage all of 
the above populations. Most of Hollywood's services are directed toward 
runaways, throwaways and homeless youth who are not gang-related. These 
organizations are sharing in making our community a better and safe place by 
caring for, supporting, educating, training and hiring youth in their programs. 
We see youth go home, get off the streets and become responsible citizens every 
week. We are appalled at the violence of other street people and know it is 
necessary with community groups and leaders to immediately address such 
violence. Good decisions must be made, not Band-Aid efforts or programs that 
just remove the blight from sight, but do little to resolve the core problems.

GOP APPROACH TO WELFARE REFORM

<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "Homeless? Hungry? It's All Your Fault," Column Left, Dec. 1: Left-wing 
scholars like Roger Boesche, not living in the real world, miss the point. Newt 
Gingrich and other conservatives are as compassionate as the good professor 
with regard to hunger and homelessness. Their approach to improve the situation 
is different! It may not be the fault of the people who find themselves in 
these difficult situations; however, it is definitely not other citizens' 
fault. Everyone makes choices every day that generally determine your position 
down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, help the unfortunate to better their lot but don't lay a guilt trip on 
the successful, the motivated and the more fortunate. They are not morally, 
legally or ethically at fault.

 * To read Boesche's column, one would conclude that the concept of laziness is 
nothing more than a myth created by the rich and powerful. If Boesche would 
bother to descend from his ivory tower, he would see that some people are 
simply more motivated than others. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, Boesche's parallel of the Democrats' disaster last month to the 
popularity of the book "The Bell Curve" is way out of bounds. The Republican 
resurgence has much less to do with racism than with the average American 
getting fed up with the liberal elite and their obsession with the failed 
concept of socialism. Until the Democrats stop making excuses and accept 
reality, they'll remain out of power.

 * Re "Welfare Reform Without Tears," editorial, Nov. 30: I just participated 
in a group analysis of the two approaches to welfare reform as part of my 
graduate program. It is interesting to note that The Times has come up with 
recommendations that are far different from ours. 
</P>
<P>
 The reality is that time limits and work requirements represent our 
misunderstanding of the welfare system, and the frustrations that arise from 
these misunderstandings. With a jobless recovery in place, and Fed Chairman 
Alan Greenspan hiking the interest rate every time unemployment falls below 6%, 
work is not available to all. And the service-sector jobs that are available 
are hardly going to lift people out of poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 Welfare is not the reason we have a trillion-dollar debt. AFDC expenditures 
represent about 2% of the national budget. If we are looking for cost 
containment, we would be better served by looking at the much more expensive 
entitlements like farm subsidies, Social Security, etc. The problem with this 
approach is that the middle and upper classes receive those benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's stop scapegoating the poor. They are not responsible for the declining 
standard of living in this country. Increasing global competition and the 
people who propose "reforming" the welfare system are.

subsidies to agribusinesses, tax breaks for businesses (including tobacco 
companies getting tax breaks to sell cigarettes abroad) and other corporate tax 
reductions labeled "incentives" (Nov. 23). Yes, cut welfare costs, but do it 
across the board, rich and poor alike!

A DREAM OF VERY LITTLE SUBSTANCE; POP MUSIC REVIEW: AT THE OPENING OF GALAXY IN 
SANTA ANA, THE BAND DEVOTES ITS TECHNICAL ABILITY TO MATERIAL THAT'S FLASHY -- 
AND MOSTLY MEANINGLESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dream Theater was the serendipitous name of the opening-night headliner for 
the Galaxy Concert Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 You could hardly dream up a better venue than the spacious, comfortable club, 
which proved itself artistically and logistically but flopped financially 
during a brief incarnation two years ago as the Rhythm Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rhythm Cafe's demise was due partly to an addiction to off-putting swanky 
touches such as valet parking and a ritzy, high-priced dinner menu, but 
primarily to withering competition from the better-established Coach House in 
San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Those obstacles are gone. The Galaxy's proprietor is Gary Folgner, the Coach 
House owner who will run the two venues in symbiotic monopoly, virtually 
cementing his position as the only promoter in Orange County for major touring 
rock and pop attractions on the club level. 
</P>
<P>
 And Folgner, doubtless one of the most unassuming and least egotistical people 
in the entertainment business, doesn't figure to make the Galaxy a palace of 
swank, although the atmosphere remains luxurious. The valets are not coming 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the headlining band, there wasn't much besides the name to make it a 
fitting opening-night attraction. Dream Theater, originally formed by 
classmates at Boston's Berklee College of Music, combined bombastic progressive 
rock influenced by Yes and Emerson, Lake & Palmer with Gargantuan heavy metal a 
la Queensryche. That's a fairly dubious premise to start with, and Dream 
Theater proceeded to accentuate the worst excesses of both styles. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes and ELP may have had their foolish and pretentious moments (well, a lot of 
them, actually). But before they lost their inspiration following early-'70s 
peaks, both bands wrote extremely seductive music that was not merely a 
springboard for Titanic displays of instrumental prowess. They were pop-rock 
bands as well as prog bands, and they could perform with delightful panache and 
a showmanly flair. 
</P>
<P>
 Dream Theater's four instrumentalists -- guitarist John Petrucci, bassist John 
Myung, drummer Mike Portnoy and keyboards player Derek Sherinian -- devoted 
their considerable technical ability to music that had little purpose except to 
show off. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all sensation, built on swelling dynamics and thundering beats (the 
head-bangers in the house had no complaint about Portnoy's brain-rattling dual 
bass drums). Most songs favored a choppy, jigsaw style of composition that 
allowed the players to show how shifty they could be but made for a diffuse 
listening experience. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Memorable melodies were few; emotional content was thin. The opening song, 
"Pull Me Under," and the closing (before encore) acoustic ballad, "The Silent 
Man," were among the few numbers in a nearly two-hour concert that proved Dream 
Theater can write a coherent, melodic song when it has a mind to. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer James LaBrie inflicted the worst sort of operatic heavy-metal vocal 
excess. Obviously there are people -- as the full-house of 550 fans attested -- 
who love this approach, in which Titanic grandeur and sheer lung power count 
for everything and the earthy, almost conversational flow of traditional rock 
singing is cast aside. 
</P>
<P>
 But if I were king, I would issue an edict that singers like LaBrie, 
Queensryche's Geoff Tate and Ray Alder of Thursday night's opening band, Fates 
Warning, be forced to wear choke collars designed for dogs that are 
nuisance-barkers. As soon as their throats swelled with one of those sustained 
high-note cries that LaBrie loves to inflict, complete with quaking vibrato, 
the choke collar would tighten, giving the singer a stark choice: perform on a 
human scale, or asphyxiate yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, the unrestricted LaBrie was free to make like Prometheus unbound or (as 
my ears hear it) a billy goat on steroids. 
</P>
<P>
 The progressive-rock tradition was built around bands that delighted in 
putting on a vivid show with a flashy look, emphasizing playfulness along with 
grandeur. Dream Theater was a drab lot whose members wore a standard-issue, 
all-black uniform of jeans and T-shirts. 
</P>
<P>
 They provided little action (the exception was drummer Portnoy, who kept 
twirling his sticks and waving his arms in grand flourishes as he held forth 
behind a kit as big as a Sherman tank). 
</P>
<P>
 LaBrie was a stiff front man with an impassive face and an immobile stage 
style; between songs, his main purpose was not to highlight themes and stories 
or to engage the crowd in a friendly way, but to communicate the fact that, 
although the current Dream Theater tour is ending, the band will most certainly 
be back next year. In that case, thank goodness for choice. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fates Warning was closer to straightforward heavy metal, with two guitars and 
booming drums -- and no keyboards. Singer Alder was somewhat less extreme with 
the operatics than LaBrie but didn't have that much more of a stage presence, 
even though his round face and long black hair gave him a passing resemblance 
to Brad Pitt's Louis the vampire. 
</P>
<P>
 It was hard for Alder to give a convincing rendition of his band's dark and 
stormy repertoire, seeing as he had all he could do to keep from giggling while 
members of Dream Theater spent the set pelting Fates Warning with edible debris 
from their dressing room high above the stage. (The ammo appeared to consist 
mainly of popcorn, potato chips, crackers and assorted fresh vegetable slices.) 
The two bands are old buddies, so Fates Warning didn't get mad about this 
end-of-tour hazing, although Alder returned fire from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenge came when a couple of the Fates brought out a miniature, pi-shaped 
model of a Stonehenge ruin while Dream Theater played one of its extended 
epics. They proceeded to dance a jig around it, in mimicry of a scene from 
"This Is Spinal Tap." 
</P>
<P>
 Both bands expressed annoyance with the Galaxy's table-seating layout, saying 
they preferred to play to standing admirers. Folgner said in an interview that 
he plans eventually to use the club's stage-side pit as standing room during 
some rock shows. With a new security crew still being broken in, he said he 
wanted his staff to get more experience before handing it the challenge of a 
standing crowd where slam dancing might break out. There won't be any moshing 
allowed in this Galaxy, Folgner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The club marked its opening night without hoopla; outside, the Galaxy's sign 
hadn't even been set up yet, and inside there were no announcements or 
ceremonies trumpeting the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Folgner said, as late as four hours before show time, it was in doubt 
whether the Galaxy would even open. He said that a paperwork problem in 
Sacramento had left the club without final approval of its liquor permit from 
state Alcoholic Beverage Control authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 It also lacked a certificate of occupancy from the city of Santa Ana. But the 
liquor license came through after feverish phone calls, and Folgner praised 
city inspectors for granting him a temporary, 30-day occupancy permit before 
the show, even though some work remains to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Folgner said he will shortly fulfill the remaining requirements, including 
putting additional lighting in the parking lot, installing a hand-activated 
fire alarm system and doing some "minor" electrical work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, Folgner was in a similar situation on the opening night of his 
ill-fated Raymond Theatre venture in Pasadena. City officials found fault with 
the fireproofing in the theater's seat cushions, and Folgner was forced to 
cancel its debut and refund 1,800 tickets. The theater subsequently opened but 
folded after a short run. In Folgner's view, it never recovered from that 
opening-night debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Pasadena, the city came out and shut me down for a few minor things," he 
said. "Santa Ana said, 'Hey, (take) two weeks and get it fixed.' They want 
business in this town, and they do everything they can to help you." 
</P>
<P>
 As a venue, the Galaxy is virtually unchanged from the Rhythm Cafe. Set up in 
five ascending tiers laid out in a semicircle around the stage, it is more like 
a theater than a nightclub. The capacity is 550, but with its high ceilings and 
expansive, carpeted interior, the room has the feel of a small concert hall 
that would seat more than 1,000 if it were laid out in rows of theater seats. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coach House, which seats 480, is by far the more intimate venue; it's the 
more appropriate hall for acoustic singer-songwriters (although under the 
Rhythm Cafe regime, there were some good shows of that type). 
</P>
<P>
 The average seat at the Galaxy is farther from the stage, but the person 
sitting in it will have more room and comfort than at the Coach House. The new 
club's big, padded chairs are positively luxurious contrasted with the hard, 
Spartan seats at the Coach House. 
</P>
<P>
 The Galaxy's sight lines are almost perfect, save for a couple of support 
beams at the back in an area set aside for standing room. The acoustics are 
good, and the elaborate stage lighting is worthy of a concert hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Dream Theater trucked in its own mammoth sound system; Folgner said the Galaxy 
will have a house system installed in time for tonight's concert by the 
acoustic guitar duo Strunz & Farah. 
</P>
<P>
 What's best about the Galaxy is the choice it affords for a county that 
traditionally has been able to support just one club with a wide range of 
touring pop attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 Those not enamored of Dream Theater's prog-metal approach could have gone to 
the Coach House and caught the Dave Matthews Band, an adventurous, jam-oriented 
acoustic ensemble. Tonight, music fans not taken with the refined, 
flamenco-style work of Strunz & Farah can try a shot of Dick Dale's raw, 
surf-rock thunder at the Coach House. At last, monopoly may be working in the 
consumer's favor.

 Spacey Summer: Universal Pictures has moved up the release of Imagine Films' 
space adventure "Apollo 13" to June 30 from its originally planned mid-November 
slot. The film is directed by Ron Howard and stars Tom Hanks, Kevin Bacon, Gary 
Sinese and Ed Harris. "We felt it could have its strongest shot in the summer," 
said a Universal spokesman, adding that the move was prompted by the progress 
of the production. Produced by Brian Grazer, the movie is based on the near 
fatal 1970 moon mission. Shooting is expected to wrap next month. POP/ROCK

of President Clinton's summit with leaders from Latin America, the Caribbean 
and Canada, include the Ballet Gran Folklorico de Mexico, poet Maya Angelou and 
actors Michael Douglas, Morgan Freeman, Jimmy Smits and Paul Rodriguez. The 
show, produced by Quincy Jones and David Salzman, will be broadcast Dec. 18 at 
9 p.m. on KCET Channel 28. But it can be seen first on the Spanish-language 
network Univision, which will air "El Concierto de Las Americas" on Sunday at 6

 MOCA Board Takes a Loss: Art collector and philanthropist Peter Norton has 
resigned from the board of trustees of the Museum of Contemporary Art. Sources 
close to the museum say that Norton left because MOCA declined to book "Black 
Male: Representations of Masculinity in Contemporary American Art." The 
controversial show, currently at New York's Whitney Museum of American Art, 
where Norton serves as a trustee, will appear at the UCLA/Armand Hammer Museum 
of Art and Cultural Center April 25 to June 18. Norton declined to comment on 
his resignation but denied that a dispute over "Black Male" was the reason. 
Norton, who joined MOCA's board in 1990, has helped to fund such exhibitions as 
Rene Green's "World Tour" and a retrospective of Martin Puryear's sculpture.

Petula Clark and David Cassidy (opening March 14 at the Wilshire Theatre).

 Woodstock Suit: The town of Saugerties, N.Y., is suing concert promoters 
Woodstock Ventures Inc. and Polygram Diversified Entertainment, claiming local 
coffers were cheated out of thousands of dollars because flimsy security 
allowed thousands of gate-crashers to attend this year's Woodstock show. An 
estimated 350,000 people -- including many who didn't pay the $135 ticket price 
-- turned out for the Aug. 13-15 Saugerties concert. Promoters have yet to say 
how many tickets were sold, but estimate that number will probably be slightly 
more than 163,000. The promoters agreed to give Saugerties $5.05 per ticket and 
have so far paid $740,000 -- proceeds from about 140,000 tickets. Woodstock 
partner Michael Lang said Thursday that there wouldn't have been as many 
gate-crashers if the town had allowed ticket sales at the site.

 Deja Vu: Singer James Brown was charged Thursday with shoving his wife, 
Adrienne, to the floor during an argument at their South Carolina home. He 
faces a maximum 30 days in jail and a $200 fine if convicted of misdemeanor 
domestic violence. The 61-year-old Godfather of Soul could face a separate 
sentence if he is charged with violation of probation, which he is serving for 
aggravated assault and failing to stop for a police officer. He served two 
years in prison after leading police on a two-state car chase in September, 
1988. That same year, Brown was charged with assault with intent to kill for 
allegedly beating Adrienne, his third wife, with a pipe and shooting into her 
car. The charges were dropped.

 Bootleg Scripts: Paramount Pictures has accused two memorabilia dealers of 
boldly going too far -- by selling bootleg copies of the script from the hit 
movie "Star Trek: Generations" before the film's release. The lawsuit, filed in 
Atlanta, names as defendants Connecticut resident Joe Kindle and the New York 
memorabilia shop Omega Zone. Both are also accused of selling a bootleg script 
from the upcoming TV series "Star Trek: Voyagers." Paramount is seeking an 
injunction to stop the sales, plus $100,000 in damages for each script sold.

 Crichton's Plot Twist: Author Michael Crichton, whose stories-turned-movies 
include the blockbuster "Jurassic Park" and the just-opened "Disclosure," has 
been sued in Los Angeles by a former assistant. When Marla Katz became 
pregnant, she claims Crichton suggested she get an abortion, then wouldn't 
employ her again when she returned from a paid maternity leave. Katz seeks 
unspecified damages from Crichton, who says he's a feminist, for sex 
discrimination, wrongful termination and breach of contract. Crichton's 
attorney called the lawsuit "outrageous" and a well-timed publicity stunt.

 Rae Yoshida, who rose through the ranks of Antelope Valley College to become 
the school's vice president of academic affairs and who volunteered much of her 
spare time and energy assisting the ill and elderly in the high desert, has 
died at her Lancaster home. She was 60. 
</P>
<P>
 An Antelope Valley resident since 1966, she died Wednesday of cancer, said 
John Yoshida, her husband of 28 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Rae Hideko Okamoto on April 23, 1934, in Watsonville, she was sent with 
her parents in 1942 to an internment camp in Poston, Ariz., in compliance with 
President Franklin D. Roosevelt's order excluding more than 100,000 people of 
Japanese ancestry from the West Coast during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The family left the camp after about six months when they were sponsored by a 
General Motors economist who moved them to Michigan. After growing up in 
Detroit, she earned her nursing degree from the University of Michigan and 
received her public health certificate from Wayne State University in Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1958, she began her career in education as an instructor at the University 
of Michigan's School of Nursing. She received her master's degree in nursing 
education from Columbia University in 1960 and became an assistant professor at 
the University of Michigan that year. 
</P>
<P>
 She moved to the Antelope Valley in 1966 after marrying her husband, who 
worked for NASA. Four years later, she was offered a job at Antelope Valley 
College developing the school's nursing program. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1974, she became the program's director and in 1975 was named dean of 
allied health. She was made vice president of academic affairs in 1981 and 
retired in August. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in the mid-1970s, Yoshida also worked for many years to establish 
services for the Antelope Valley's ill and elderly.  
</P>
<P>
 Yoshida is survived by no other immediate relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 A viewing is scheduled today from 2 to 8 p.m. at Mumaw Funeral Home, 44663 N. 
Date Ave., Lancaster. A memorial service will be held at 2 p.m. Monday at St. 
Paul's Episcopal Church, 502 W. Ave. K, Lancaster. In lieu of flowers, memorial 
donations may be made to a scholarship in Yoshida's name at Antelope Valley 
College or to the Visiting Nurse Assn. of Los Angeles.

ROLE REVERSAL: CLIPPERS CRUSH HAPLESS LAKERS; PRO BASKETBALL: THEY MAKE IT TWO 
IN A ROW BY TAKING 28-POINT HALFTIME LEAD IN 109-84 VICTORY. 
</P>

 They had been stepped on more than the concrete in front of Mann's Chinese 
Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 They had been batting practice. 
</P>
<P>
 They had been has-beens. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was no Magical Misery Tour that pulled into the Forum on Friday 
night. That was Clipper frustrations, partially eroded by beating Milwaukee two 
nights earlier, flooding out all at once and sweeping away the flat-footed 
Lakers, 109-84, before 10,768. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had been frustrated," said Loy Vaught, who always seems to play well 
against the cross-town rivals and this time contributed 19 points and a 
team-high 15 rebounds. "I don't know -- that first win triggered it for us. We 
got that first taste of victory, and it tasted sweet." 
</P>
<P>
 This was pretty good too, a shocker not only because it was a Clipper victory 
but because it was a dominating Clipper victory. Because the Clippers now have 
a two-game winning streak.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think we surprised ourselves a little bit," said Malik Sealy, who replaced 
the injured Terry Dehere at shooting guard and responded with 25 points and 
eight rebounds. "We just wanted to continue to work hard. Every game that we 
were losing, I think we gained a little confidence in ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 So they came in with several tons of confidence. Then they dropped it all on 
the Lakers, making the hosts, of all people, play the doormat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Surprising," Vlade Divac said after getting 21 points and a game-high 17 
rebounds in the loss. "But see what happens. Only two things: We deserved to 
lose and they deserved to win." 
</P>
<P>
 There was little doubt about that. The Clippers led by as many as 32 points -- 
67-35 early in the third quarter -- and were challenged only once after the 
opening quarter. That's when the Lakers, their four-game home winning streak a 
memory, threatened by getting within 11 early in the fourth quarter, before the 
rally stalled without ever really gaining speed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought our guys gave a pretty decent effort in the second half," Laker 
Coach Del Harris said. "But we have to pay the price for what happened at the 
start." 
</P>
<P>
 About that worst-team-in-the-league stuff? Try selling it to the Lakers, who 
were rested and still needed only 6:35 to fall behind by 10 points and finished 
the first quarter down, 30-16, while committing 11 turnovers, already only 
about three fewer than their league-best average coming in. 
</P>
<P>
 Turned out that was nothing more than a warm-up. The Clippers poured it on in 
the second quarter, meeting little resistance from the Lakers along the way 
while turning the game into a blowout, stretching the lead to 26 on Lamond 
Murray's dunk with 7:23 left in the half, to 27 on a free throw by Sealy with 
49 seconds to go and, finally, to 28 on Pooh Richardson's three-pointer with 26 
seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where it was at halftime, 63-35. Any resemblance to the Clippers was 
purely coincidental. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers got booed loudly four times before intermission, then the halftime 
show got booed even worse. At least their crowd showed signs of life. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 So who else besides the Clippers was happy with Wednesday's streak-breaking 
win over the Milwaukee Bucks? Apparently the members of the Miami Heat, who, 
believe it or not, did not want to share the spot in the record book with 17 
consecutive losses to open a season. "Our team would be able to play with that 
Clippers team head to head and pound for pound," former Heat center Scott 
Hastings told the Sun Sentinel of Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. "We could even get all 
the guys together today and beat them, even with me and (Jon Sundvold) coming 
out of retirement." Miami broke its streak by winning at the Sports Arena and 
finished with 15 victories. . . . Rebounding remains a problem for the Lakers 
-- they went into the game 22nd in the league by percentage -- but don't expect 
them to get heavily involved in trade talks for disgruntled Spur Dennis Rodman. 
Even if they were convinced he would not become more of a problem than an 
asset, Rodman's salary means that it would probably require two key players or 
one major player to get him, and the Lakers have no interest in going that 
high. Clippers On-Line

BRUINS FALL SHORT IN SEMIFINAL, 4-1; SOCCER: INDIANA ROLLS TO VICTORY OVER 
UCLA, WILL FACE VIRGINIA FOR CHAMPIONSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 This time there was no comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA Bruins will be back in Los Angeles as Virginia and Indiana play 
Sunday for the NCAA men's soccer title. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to mount the kind of last-minute heroics for which they have become 
known this season, the Bruins were beaten, 4-1, by the Hoosiers in the 
semifinals Saturday in front of a record 11,848 at Richardson Field on the 
Davidson College campus. 
</P>
<P>
 In the earlier -- and far more entertaining -- semifinal, three-time defending 
champion Virginia came from behind to beat Rutgers, 2-1, to reach the final for 
the fourth successive year. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA was never in it, falling behind in the fifth minute, fighting back to tie 
in the 19th minute, and then yielding three goals without reply. It was not the 
Bruins' finest hour and a half. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Sigi Schmid acknowledged as much afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, I think the game tonight is not a reflection of how we can truly 
play," he said. "I think we played under par a little bit. Indiana came out and 
played very well. They established a tempo early in the game. They were very 
aggressive. I thought they wanted the ball a little more in the early parts of 
the game and, as a result, they had a deserved halftime lead." 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana, the nation's top-ranked team, dominated throughout, overpowering the 
Bruins physically and tactically. The Hoosier midfield, in particular, was 
clearly superior. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA was 15-0 in games in which it scored the first goal. So things went awry 
early when Todd Yeagley, son of Indiana Coach Jerry Yeagley, curved a free kick 
toward the net in the fifth minute and teammate Tim Hardy sprinted in to 
deflect it past UCLA's freshman goalkeeper, Matt Reis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins fought back, capitalizing on a free kick of their own 15 minutes 
later when Greg Vanney's shot across the Indiana goal mouth was redirected into 
the lower right corner of the net by teammate Eddie Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, it was all downhill for UCLA. A couple of minutes before halftime, 
the Hoosiers regained the lead when a shot from Caleb Porter screamed into the 
net from about 20 yards, giving Reis no chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first 15 or 20 minutes of the second half, I thought we did a pretty 
good job of trying to grab the game back," Schmid said. "We had some chances." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Indiana had more and took advantage of them. When Hoosier 
midfielder Brian Maisonneauve broke free in the 50th minute, UCLA sweeper Kenny 
Wright moved in to tackle him, but his attempted clearance kick rebounded off 
Maisonneauve, who fired a shot past Reis. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana's final goal came with 1:26 to play when Maisonneauve again eluded the 
defense and went in one on one against Reis, beating him with relative ease. 
</P>
<P>
 Reis was filling in for Chris Snitko, the Bruins' usual starting goalkeeper 
who had been given a red card in the quarterfinal victory over Charleston. 
Schmid said he did not blame his backup keeper for the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 On a bitterly cold evening, UCLA's play matched the weather. Having won eight 
games this season in the last 10 minutes, including three playoff games, the 
Bruins had come to be known as the "Cardiac Kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia came from behind to win its match against a Rutgers team that played 
very well in defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Scarlet Knights surprised the Cavaliers with a headed goal by defender 
Kevin O'Connell off a corner kick by Andreas Maier in the 10th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cavaliers tied it in the 23rd minute when Damian Silvera scored from about 
15 yards off a pass from Tain Nix. Virginia's winning goal was scored in the 
54th minute, when Billy Walsh scored from close range.

A FEW SMALL CHANGES WOULD HELP RAIDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a season-ticket holder since the Raiders came to Los Angeles, I have 
several suggestions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bronze Al Davis and put him physically in the Hall of Fame in Canton.He has 
been out (of touch) of football for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Move Art Shell to line coach. The line needs to be coached about rules that 
few seem to know or remember.

COACHING CHOICES COME UNDER SCRUTINY

 It should have been music to every UCLA football fan's ears: "After a superb 
season as offensive coordinator, Rick Neuheisel was named head coach, replacing 
a retiring coach, who after several years at the helm finally decided to step 
down." Unfortunately it happened at Colorado, not UCLA.Oh well, you can't blame 
a fan for dreaming.

 What is going on at USC? 
</P>
<P>
 One must ask how a school that prides itself on family, honor, loyalty and 
dignity can fire someone the stature of Don Lindsey, not let him say goodby or 
explain it to his players and erroneously report to the newspaper that he quit 
before the season was completed and gave up on the situation at hand? 
</P>
<P>
 Good luck in the Cotton Bowl, Trojans. You'll need it without Don Lindsey.

 I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw that Jesse Jackson had condemned the 
University of Colorado for hiring Rick Neuheisel and urged a boycott of 
Colorado. Jackson's urging seems out of touch with reality, considering that 
Rashaan Salaam, Colorado's Heisman Trophy hopeful, said that the hiring of 
Neuheisel would help him decide to stay at Colorado for his senior year and 
Kordell Stewart said that Neuheisel had been the difference in his becoming a 
top quarterback. If they do not feel that the hiring of Neuheisel was a racist 
decision, why does he protest?

 On Dec. 2, the headline read: "Ex-Boxing Figure Flores Dies at 78."Two weeks 
before his death, Johnnie Flores was working the corner of fighters at the 
Forum, where his skill and expertise were indispensable. Flores was as active 
then as he was more than 40 years ago.

 Johnnie Flores was as much an "ex-boxing figure" as John Paul II is "ex-Pope."

OK, IT TOOK 17 GAMES, BUT CLIPPERS DISCOVER YOU CAN'T LOSE 'EM ALL

<P>
 After seeing a fantastic game in which the Clippers were trying to avoid their 
17th loss in a row and the Milwaukee Bucks their ninth, I don't think the man 
thought it all the way through when he said: "Don't just play not to lose."

 I feel compelled to respond to Mike Downey's column of Dec. 5. My father and I 
have been season-ticket holders since the Clippers came to Los Angeles. I 
understand that it is easy to make fun of the Clippers, but how do you expect 
the team to play better or be more motivated when their own city is not behind 
them? 
</P>
<P>
 Since they arrived here, they seem to have only fair-weather fans. Two years 
ago, when they went to the playoffs, the arena was packed. Now, when they need 
the support of Los Angeles more than ever, no one attends the games and they 
get constantly trashed by the media. Maybe if people had a more positive 
attitude toward the team, it might give the players the incentive to win that 
has been lacking. Let's try to root them to a victory instead of an 0-82 
season.

 I was amused to read Mark (Matador Defense) Jackson's contention that the 
reason the Clippers stink this year is because last year no one on the team 
hustled (except for Jackson, of course, and two unnamed "others"). Actually, 
this year's Clippers stink because they have very little talent and what little 
they have lacks experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the current Clippers are better coached than last year's, and 
they play the game with more spirit and even, yes, intelligence. Last year's 
team had far more talent, but they cheated their fans and I grew to hate them. 
This year's team seems hopeless, yet they refuse to quit or make cheap excuses. 
They deserve some loyalty.

FANS NOT CLAMORING FOR RAMS TO STAY

 I suspect that Jim Everett would like to wish the Rams' ownership and 
management a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year for: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Trading him to the Saints. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Rejuvenating his career and wallet. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Allowing him to embarrass the Rams twice. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Proving to the world that the Ram offense really is obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Showing that no matter how many times you change the quarterback, other 
players, coaches or home city, you still can't win if you have the same 
bungling ownership and management.

 So Darryl Henley thinks the Rams' loss to the Saints was "humiliating?" Maybe 
now Henley knows what many Ram fans feel with him merely being on the roster. 
Too bad ownership and management don't share the feelings of the fans, but when 
did they ever?

 Bon voyage, Rams.

 Hey, L.A. football fans, let them go, cheer them on. The Rams and possibly the 
Raiders moving would be a blessing in disguise. No more blackouts, all those 
wonderful games on TV. Only 50,000-60,000 actually go to the games, while 
millions are denied the big games on TV. We would go from the worst TV viewing 
area to the best. Goodby Rams, goodby Raiders.

 If the Rams move to Baltimore, they couldn't change their name to the Colts, 
as another team already uses that name. But they could probably change their 
name to the Clots. This would be a good play on the name and also would be the 
true-to-life name in pro football.

NORTHRIDGE GETS UNEXPECTED LIFT COULD PRACTICE BE OVERRATED? 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ryan Martin, a senior guard on the Cal State Northridge basketball team, spent 
most of fall workouts rehabilitating an injured back and practiced only five 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 So guess who has scored in double figures -- as a reserve, no less -- in four 
of Northridge's five games? 
</P>
<P>
 Martin scored 11 points in 20 minutes, including two key free throws with six 
seconds left, to help Northridge beat San Diego State, 73-68, Friday night in a 
nonconference game before 676 in the Northridge Gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Balancing Martin's outside shooting was the inside work of Peter Micelli. The 
Matadors' 6-foot-8 center scored a team-high 17 points as Northridge (2-3) won 
its second in a row after opening with three consecutive losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Hill added 13 points for Northridge. 
</P>

 Marc Carter scored a game-high 19 points for San Diego State (3-2). MIKE

NBA ROUNDUP; BLAYLOCK BREAKS LOCK, AND HAWKS BEAT KNICKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mookie Blaylock capped a strong performance with a tiebreaking three-point 
shot with 39 seconds to play, lifting the Atlanta Hawks to an 89-85 victory 
over the New York Knicks on Friday night at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Blaylock's basket gave the Hawks an 86-83 lead, and Grant Long stretched it to 
88-83 by making two free throws with just under 25 seconds to play. 
</P>
<P>
 After Patrick Ewing scored to make it 88-85 with 11.9 seconds to play, 
Blaylock ended the scoring by making one of two free throws one second later. 
</P>
<P>
 Blaylock led the Hawks with 17 points, 11 rebounds, nine assists and four 
steals. He had only one turnover in 39 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Smith had 16, all in the first half, and Long added 15 for Atlanta. 
Ewing and Charles Smith each scored 20 for the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the 934th victory for Hawk Coach Lenny Wilkens, four shy of the NBA 
record held by Red Auerbach. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 110, Miami 96 -- Orlando routed the Heat for the second time this 
season, building a 20-point lead in nine minutes and coasting at Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaquille O'Neal led the Magic with 25 points. Anfernee Hardaway added 24 
points, including five three-point shots, as Orlando won its fourth in a row at 
Miami Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Owens had a season-high 21 points for Miami. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 117, Detroit 96 -- B.J. Armstrong scored a season-high 22 points to 
lead the Bulls at Auburn Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pistons were without their two leading scorers. Joe Dumars missed the game 
because of bronchitis and Grant Hill because of flu and a sore left foot. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse for Detroit, point guard Lindsey Hunter left the game in 
the fourth quarter because of an injured right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls are 6-0 against the Pistons since Michael Jordan's retirement. 
Detroit never led and didn't get within 10 points in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 96, Boston 89 -- John Williams scored a season-high 20 points to 
lead the Cavaliers at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland ended a three-game losing streak and won its third consecutive game 
in the Boston Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston trailed, 70-59, at the end of three quarters but cut the Cavaliers' 
lead to 76-70 with 8:09 left in the game. Tyrone Hill and Chris Mills each 
score four points in a 10-0 Cavalier run that put Cleveland ahead, 86-70 with 
4:49 to play and the Celtics never caught up. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominique Wilkins led Boston with 27 points, 14 in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Indiana 94, Philadelphia 88 -- Derrick McKey scored 15 points and Dale Davis 
had 14 points and a season-high 18 rebounds as the Pacers won at Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 LaSalle Thompson had 13 points and Reggie Miller scored 12 for the Pacers, who 
won their fourth in a row despite playing without Rik Smits and Antonio Davis, 
both sidelined because of injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Malone had 17 points for Philadelphia, giving him a career total of 
17,015 points. Malone became the 47th NBA player to go over 17,000 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland 116, Golden State 107 -- Clifford Robinson scored 28 points and Clyde 
Drexler added 26 as the Trail Blazers won at Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland guard Rod Strickland, sidelined because of a wrist fracture since 
Nov. 15, started and had 15 points, 13 assists and four rebounds in 36 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Hardaway led the Warriors with 21 points and David Wood added 14.

BLAKE REACHES NEW HEIGHTS AS BENGAL QUARTERBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON AMORE, HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Blake's flirtation with fame has lasted nearly two months -- far more 
than the customary 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Why spoil it all by asking about his height? 
</P>
<P>
 "I still don't understand what height has to do with playing quarterback," 
said Blake, the former third stringer now starting at quarterback for the 
Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 foot, Blake is the shortest quarterback on an NFL roster. Most are in the 
6-3 to 6-5 range, though some, such as the Kansas City Chiefs' Joe Montana 
(listed at 6-2) are taller in the media guide. 
</P>
<P>
 Many statuesque quarterbacks, though, would like to know how the air is down 
there, considering Blake's performance in six starts. The Bengals were 0-7 when 
injuries to starter David Klingler and backup Don Hollas forced coach David 
Shula to play Blake, who was cut by the Jets in training camp, against the 
Cowboys Oct. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake passed for 243 yards and two touchdowns as the 15-point underdog 
Bengals, who had a 14-0 lead, lost, 23-20. A week later, he passed for 377 as 
the Bengals beat the Seattle Seahawks in overtime, 20-17. Then he passed for 
348 in a 34-31 victory over the Houston Oilers Nov. 13. Things have cooled the 
past three weeks, but in losses to the Indianapolis Colts (17-13), Denver 
Broncos (15-13) and Pittsburgh Steelers (38-15, a close game late in the third 
quarter), the Bengals (2-11), who play the New York Giants (6-7) at Giants 
Stadium Sunday, have been decidedly more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Klingler, a 6-2, first-round draft choice making $1.1 million, has recovered 
from his sprained knee -- but not regained his job. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the injuries, we had no choice but to play Jeff," Shula said. "He was so 
productive, he deserves the chance to continue to play. It was a natural 
decision. Our offensive production has risen significantly, and the level of 
play of people like (wide receiver) Carl Pickens has also risen." 
</P>
<P>
 Blake, who turns 24 Dec. 24, has completed 112 of 199 for 1,566 yards and nine 
touchdowns with five interceptions. His 86.4 rating is third in the American 
Football Conference behind the Miami Dolphins' Dan Marino (88) and Denver's 
John Elway (87). 
</P>
<P>
 "The important thing is everybody is having fun," Blake said. "I couldn't 
believe the way the city reacted. After one game, they made me feel like a 
first-round draft pick. I guess they haven't had much excitement here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bengals averaged 259 total yards in the first seven games, 347 since Blake 
became the starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blake has made a big difference," Giants Coach Dan Reeves said. "He has made 
some big-time throws and given them confidence they can compete. They have a 
couple of dangerous receivers in Darnay Scott (39 receptions, 776 yards) and 
Pickens (50, 874), but that all came about since Blake has been in there."

INJURY GIVES AGNEW CHANCE WITH PATRIOTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY PRICE, HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The forgotten man of the New England Patriots wants everybody to remember one 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider myself a football player," he said. "It's not like I haven't 
played before." 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive lineman Ray Agnew used to play a lot. This season, they stopped 
calling his number. Or, rather, Patriots Coach Bill Parcells did. 
</P>
<P>
 Agnew's number got called Week Two, Week Three, Week Four, Week Five and Week 
Six. Each time, the PA announcer would say, "No. 92, Ray Agnew, inactive." 
</P>
<P>
 Inactive. Agnew had always been active. He was a first-round draft pick in 
1990 out of North Carolina State (10th overall) and he started 34 games his 
first four seasons. He wasn't spectacular, but he was dependable. 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots are depending on Agnew again. He will start at nose tackle Sunday 
when the Patriots (7-6) hope to further their playoff aspirations against the 
Indianapolis Colts (6-7). 
</P>
<P>
 Agnew, converted to nose tackle this season, will replace Tim Goad, who broke 
his right leg last Sunday in the 23-14 victory over the New York Jets. It will 
be the first start at nose tackle for Agnew, who turned 27 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad that I'm getting a chance to play, but I didn't want it to happen 
this way, especially since Tim's a good friend," Agnew said. 
</P>
<P>
 Goad was hurt while trying to pressure quarterback Boomer Esiason. In came 
Agnew, who recorded four tackles and knocked down a pass. It was a solid 
contribution, one that Agnew had never given up hope of making. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got in, it was important to me that there not be a letdown from what 
Tim was doing," Agnew said. "I was excited to get a chance to play. My 
adrenaline was flowing." 
</P>
<P>
 Parcells had to caution him against standing over an opponent and risking a 
penalty by taunting. 
</P>
<P>
 Agnew lost his starting job to Mike Pitts last season, one game into the 
Parcells era. He was a bit player all of 1993 and that continued this season. 
When active, he played sparingly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of respect for Ray Agnew," Parcells said. "He's a real team 
player. Things aren't perfect for him. He never says anything. He just comes 
out and practices and plays. Any time you ask him to do something, he does it. 
He'll do a good job." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of Goad is a big one. He typified the Patriots' defense -- somewhat 
undersized, maybe, but he tried hard. Agnew, 6-foot-3, 272 pounds, is out of 
the same mold. He is very soft-spoken, but resilient; he played one season 
after having the tip of a finger severed. 
</P>
<P>
 His mental toughness was tested by the time spent standing on the sideline in 
street clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe in causing trouble," he said. "I don't go running to the 
press to complain. The way I look at it, people who do that are looking for a 
way out. They're looking for excuses. I just think that if you're in a bad 
situation, you do everything you can to work your way out. Some way. Somehow. I 
pride myself on being a man."

NICKLAUS AND PALMER ARE A WINNING TEAM; GOLF: LEGENDS SCORE FIRST-ROUND VICTORY 
AND HAVE A GOOD TIME DOING IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dressed in charcoal slacks and short-sleeved shirts, the former heavyweight 
champions of golf stood tall in the bright sunshine and cast a long shadow over 
the green, as imposing as a couple of downhill putts. 
</P>
<P>
 There they were, 65-year-old Arnold Palmer and 54-year-old Jack Nicklaus, 
teaming up in the Diners Club Matches, together again Friday for the first time 
in 21 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Generously and sentimentally seeded first in the Senior PGA Tour bracket, they 
won their opening match, 1 up, over Simon Hobday and Tom Weiskopf on the first 
playoff hole on the Jack Nicklaus Resort Course at PGA West. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed like old times, didn't it? 
</P>
<P>
 "I got very nostalgic about a couple of putts Jack hit," said Palmer, who was, 
of course, joking. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer has been seeing Nicklaus' putts roll in the hole since Nicklaus beat 
him in a playoff in the 1962 U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
 As partnerships go, it has been sporadic. Nicklaus and Palmer hadn't teamed in 
match play since the 1973 Ryder Cup, but they must have had the 21-year itch. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer and Nicklaus decided over dinner in Florida months ago to play the 
Diners Club, which seems like the perfect place for such a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 They won Friday when their opponents conceded Nicklaus a two-putt from 18 
feet. It turned out to be a popular decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very happy," Palmer said. "But we were both a little surprised, to be 
perfectly honest about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer and Nicklaus, who have won 28 major championships between them, 
admitted they had a nice time playing together. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a ball," Nicklaus said. "We were walking down the fairway, I guess on 
13, and I asked Arnie, 'Are you having fun?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Palmer admitted he was. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would have had more fun if we were 2 or 3 up," Palmer said. "But you know, 
we had fun. That's not an idle sentence. We had fun." 
</P>
<P>
 They also had the largest gallery, but one befitting their status as golf's 
Dream Team. But even at their elevation, Nicklaus and Palmer never forget what 
year it is. 
</P>
<P>
 Their irons play shorter and their hair gets grayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Nicklaus: "We had our hands full; we didn't have time to get nostalgic." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hall of so what? 
</P>
<P>
 On the opening day of the LPGA tour matches, Beth Daniel and Meg Mallon 
managed to defeat two Hall of Fame members, beating Patty Sheehan and Nancy 
Lopez, 6 and 5. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ball was rolling very well," Mallon said. 
</P>
<P>
 The longest match of the day lasted 20 holes, with Fuzzy Zoeller and Curtis 
Strange outlasting John Huston and Brian Claar, 1 up, on the second day of the 
PGA Tour matches. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoeller and Strange will play Lee Janzen and Rocco Mediate in one semifinal 
today. Jeff Maggert and Jim McGovern will play Bill Glasson and David Edwards 
in the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry and Gibby Gilbert will face Raymond Floyd and Dave Eichelberger in a 
senior semifinal, and Nicklaus and Palmer play Jim Dent and Chi Chi Rodriguez 
in the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklaus said he and Palmer are delighted to be playing today. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would be even more delighted to be playing on Sunday," he said.

MASSACHUSETTS GRADES CONTROVERSY IS BECOMING A STUDY IN MOTIVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON MARKUS, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 College basketball teams often pick up a cause in the course of a season. 
Something to bring the players closer, something coaches can use as a 
motivational tool as the NCAA tournament approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 When Arkansas won last season's national championship, Nolan Richardson and 
his Razorbacks spoke about what they perceived to be a lack of respect. In 
their minds, it didn't come until they had beaten Duke in the NCAA final. 
</P>
<P>
 Massachusetts is trying to become this season's Arkansas on the court, and the 
fifth-ranked Minutemen have taken on a similar us-against-the-world persona. It 
has nothing to do with the perception of them as players, though, but as 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think in any way you can look at something like this and say it was 
good that it happened," Massachusetts Coach John Calipari said in his office 
Tuesday afternoon. "But dealing with adversity proves whether or not you're a 
champion." 
</P>
<P>
 Calipari was referring to the controversy that has followed the Minutemen 
since mid- October. Four days after the start of practice, the Boston Globe 
reported that four of the team's players, including three starters, were on 
academic probation for having an overall grade-point average of 2.0 or less. 
Two others, the Globe reported, were on academic warning because their GPAs 
were below 2.0 last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The report -- which has been quietly yet aggressively disputed by university 
officials and questioned by the high school coach of at least one of the 
players -- has become the unwanted focus of the 1994-95 season for Calipari and 
his players. 
</P>
<P>
 It has followed them 15 miles down the interstate to Springfield, where 
Massachusetts beat then-top-ranked Arkansas in the season-opening Tip-Off 
Classic. It followed them Saturday to Anaheim, where the then-No. 1 Minutemen 
lost to seventh-ranked Kansas in the John Wooden Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 And it will follow them to the Baltimore Arena, where today Massachusetts 
takes on No. 11 Maryland in a nationally televised game between two familiar 
rivals. Undoubtedly, it will follow the Minutemen the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's over," said Calipari, who, because of privacy laws and an 
internal university investigation into how the information was obtained, 
declined to comment on the specifics of the report. "But if a person has any 
knowledge of college athletics, this could have been done anywhere. It's part 
of being successful and coming from where we did to where we are now. I've had 
friends call me and say, 'Welcome to college basketball.' 
</P>
<P>
 "My problem was how they embarrassed the kids. I told the kids, 'It's not 
about you, it's about me.' I stand by my record. The six kids who were 
highlighted in the piece, I believe all six kids will graduate. It's been 
painted in a way that I don't think is true. Once a perception is there, it's 
hard to break. But I think this program and my record will stand the test of 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Calipari, 35, isn't talking about his 131-65 record in six-plus seasons at 
Massachusetts. He isn't talking about the three straight Atlantic 10 
regular-season and postseason championships, the five postseason appearances 
that include three straight NCAA tournament bids or the trip to Sweet 16 in 
1992. He isn't talking about the first No. 1 ranking, however short-lived, in 
school history. 
</P>
<P>
 What he is talking about is this: 
</P>
<P>
 -- That a survey by the NCAA reported earlier this year showed a 75 percent 
graduation rate at UMass. 
</P>
<P>
 -- That the first of three Prop 48 players he recruited, Kennard Robinson, 
graduated in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- That starting point guard Derek Kellogg is a two-time academic 
all-conference performer as a real estate and finance major, something that 
wasn't reported by the Globe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame that the whole picture wasn't shown, just one snapshot of a 
24-exposure," Kellogg said this week. "I see how hard these guys work in study 
halls." 
</P>
<P>
 That snapshot has led to other national media outlets criticizing 
Massachusetts for the job it has done educating the basketball team. Sports 
Illustrated chastised Calipari for being a highly paid self-promoter in a 
column titled "UMess." 
</P>
<P>
 It has led Massachusetts to take what sophomore center Marcus Camby called "an 
us-against-the world attitude, like Arkansas had last season." Senior forward 
Lou Roe, the team's floor leader, said: "It's definitely brought the team 
closer together. It's time to circle the wagons and depend on each other, 
because that's all we have right now. We want to prove everyone wrong whether 
it's on the basketball court or in the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 To that end, the Minutemen reportedly held a players-only meeting last month 
and set a goal for a team GPA of 2.5 or better for this semester. Though 
Calipari denies that the Globe story had anything do with his closing practice 
for a couple of weeks at the start of the season, there was definitely a bunker 
mentality for a while. Calipari since has reopened practice to the media, but 
has not let down his guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "They made a commitment to having a good term academically before any of this 
came out," said Calipari, who handed down a three-game suspension to one of his 
starters, guard Mike Williams, for poor classroom attendance past spring. "But 
you don't help these kids by publicly humiliating them. Kids who come in here 
from a tough academic background and graduate with a 2.0, that's quite an 
accomplishment. They might be the first person in their family to graduate from 
college. Their getting a 2.0 is like a suburban kid coming here and getting a 
4.0." 
</P>
<P>
 University officials are among Calipari's staunch defenders, pointing out that 
the program was not only in disarray on the court when he was hired in 1988, 
but off the court as well. The NCAA survey backed that up, reporting that 
Calipari's predecessor, Ron Gerlufsen, failed to graduate a single player 
during his coaching tenure. The Minutemen had a stretch of 10 11 straight 
losing years that included Calipari's first season. 
</P>
<P>
 Said university president Michael Hooker: "I think he (Calipari) will come out 
of this OK. He has something to prove. He's not going to be embarrassed. John 
is very good at his job." 
</P>
<P>
 Hooker, who has been president of the University of Massachusetts system since 
1992, said that the Globe likely would not have written the story "had we not 
been a successful program." But Hooker, who served as president of the 
University of Maryland Baltimore County for seven years, added: "You live by 
the sword, you die by the sword. If you use the positive publicity to attract 
students, you have to suffer public scrutiny and learn to accept it." 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean Hooker believes what the Globe wrote was either fair or 
accurate. While he and other university officials decline to talk about 
possible discrepancies between the players' transcripts and what was reported, 
the high school coach of junior forward Dana Dingle called a New York radio 
station to say that he saw the player's transcript and his grades last semester 
were well above university standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it happened in January, something like that could wreck a season," said 
Calipari. "The fact that it happened so early, it happened at a good time -- if 
there is ever a good time." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it will bring the Minutemen closer together. Maybe Calipari, if he 
hasn't already, will use it to motivate his players when they have a bad game. 
And maybe, just maybe, it will become the cause on which this season's national 
championship is built.

 USC senior Meika Wagner sighed and thought about the last match of her college 
career Friday night. It was her last match because the second-ranked Stanford 
Cardinal had swept USC out of the NCAA volleyball West Regional. 
</P>
<P>
 "Games 1 and 2 could have gone either way," Wagner said after USC's season 
ended by the scores of 15-13, 15-13, 15-6 before 3,534 at Maples Pavilion. "Our 
team just shot itself in the foot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Give credit to Stanford, but we can hit and swing with anybody out there. We 
just didn't execute." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first appearance in a regional final for USC since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed by the loss, but I'm awfully proud of USC this year," Coach 
Lisa Love said. "Stanford had a lot of firepower, and it won out in the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford (30-1) advanced to the final four in Austin, Tex., and plays Ohio 
State or Long Beach State on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 After USC (22-8) tied the first game, 13-13, the teams played through eight 
sideouts before Stanford scored on a kill by Cary Wendell. On the next play, 
Wagner was whistled for a lift violation, which secured the first game for 
Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 The second game was also tied, 13-13, but three consecutive kills from Marnie 
Triefenbach ended the game in a blur. 
</P>
<P>
 Kristin Folkl, the national freshman of the year, made the big plays in the 
third game. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford, which has won 18 in a row over USC at Maples, got a match-high 24 
kills from Folkl. VICTOR CHI

WOMEN'S VOLLEYBALL; UCLA SWEEPS INTO SEMIFINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT STOLZE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After a one-year absence, the UCLA women's volleyball team is returning to the 
NCAA final four. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins, who missed the semifinals last season after consecutive trips from 
1988-1992, are headed to Austin, Tex., thanks to a 15-5, 15-7, 15-12 victory 
over Houston on Friday night in the South Regional final in front of 351 at the 
Stephen C. O'Connell Center. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA (31-3) will face the winner of today's Nebraska-Penn State match in 
Thursday's semifinal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great to be going to the final four this year," Coach Andy Banachowski 
said. "I think this team really had a good year. They worked hard all year 
long." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA took control early in the match as it jumped to an 8-2 lead before 
cruising to the 15-5 victory in the first game. 
</P>
<P>
 Four Bruins got three or more kills, while Houston's players looked tentative. 
Lilly Denoon-Chester, the Southwest Conference player of the year, managed only 
one kill. She picked up her play early in the second game, however, and sparked 
the Cougars (26-7) to a 6-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Bruins picked up their defense at the net and shut Houston down. Led 
by seven kills from junior outside hitter Jenny Johnson, UCLA went on a 14-1 
run to close out the game, and for all intents and purposes, the match. 
</P>
<P>
 "The second game was real crucial to the outcome of the match," Banachowski 
said. "Houston jumped out to a big lead, and we were able to stop them from 
scoring any more points. I thought Jenny helped us in being steady in that 
drive." 
</P>
<P>
 As they did on Thursday, the Bruins finished with a balanced offensive attack. 
Sophomore middle blocker Kim Krull led the team with 14 kills, followed by 
Johnson (13), senior outside hitters Annett Buckner (12) and Alyson Randick 
(10). Sophomore setter Kelly Flannigan had 45 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes it really easy when you don't have necessarily just one hitter 
that's so much better than everyone else," Flannigan said. "When you can count 
on every hitter, it makes it really easy to run a diverse offense."

JETS PLAN TO FOCUS ON KRIEG, SANDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF WILLIAMS, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ideal New York Jets game plan against the Detroit Lions today would force 
Dave Krieg to run and Barry Sanders to pass. It's a surefire strategy based on 
these numbers: Krieg, 125; Sanders, 0-for-1. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the 125. That's the number of fumbles Krieg, the Lions' quarterback, 
has been guilty of in his 15-year career. That's a National Football League 
record. Second, the 0-for-1. That's the career passing record for Sanders, the 
NFL's leading rusher this season. Get Krieg running, Sanders passing and chalk 
up a crucial victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Fumble No. 125 came on Krieg's first snap from center this season, in the 
second quarter against the Packers in Green Bay Nov. 6. Krieg came into the 
game to replace starter Scott Mitchell, who suffered a broken right hand. He 
bobbled the snap, the Packers recovered and scored a touchdown for a 17-0 lead 
in a game they eventually won, 38-30. 
</P>
<P>
 Krieg hasn't fumbled since, and the Lions have won three of their last four to 
pull into playoff contention. He hasn't thrown an interception either, and even 
in that Nov. 6 loss to the Packers he produced a brilliant second half, 
throwing for 275 yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "Barry doesn't fumble and Krieg doesn't throw interceptions," Jets Coach Pete 
Carroll said. "I wish we could get close enough to David to force him to fumble 
because he has a little history of that." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Krieg has a lot of history. Though his career doesn't include fingers 
full of Super Bowl rings, it is nonetheless substantial. He is 15th in career 
passing with 31,554 yards and 11th in career touchdown passes with 227, with 10 
of those coming this season in five games. Most of those TD passes came when he 
was the Seattle Seahawks' quarterback for more than a decade, from 1980-91. 
Many of them went into the hands of Steve Largent, whose consecutive-game 
reception mark might be broken by Art Monk Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Krieg might have been a Jet this season if he hadn't gone to a New York Knicks 
game with Boomer Esiason. The Jets brought Krieg into town last April with the 
idea he would back up Esiason this season. Esiason and Krieg have known each 
other for some time and Esiason offered to drive him to a Knicks game. Should 
have taken the train. They became frustratingly lodged on the LIE at 4:30 in 
the afternoon. Then fans at the Garden kept chanting "Booma, Booma, Booma." 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess you have to be from here to understand," Esiason said. "He had had 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
 The traffic and the Madison Square Garden crowd would have been entirely 
bearable, but the prospect of being a backup was not. Krieg still thought he 
could be a starter, though he was dislodged from that role in 1993, his second 
year with the Kansas City Chiefs, when Joe Montana came to town. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you start in this league you don't ever want to be (a backup)," Esiason 
said. "After what he has accomplished in his career, I'm sure he felt that he 
could still do those sort of things." 
</P>
<P>
 Krieg's search to be a starter didn't materialize, so he signed to be a backup 
with the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions already had signed Mitchell as a free agent from the Dolphins and 
they intended to play him. After all, they gave him an $11.1-million contract 
and weren't about to have him ride the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell was outstanding in the preseason, but when the real games rolled 
around he was disappointingly inconsistent, great for a quarter or a half, 
lousy the rest of the time. The Lions were 4-5 when Mitchell's injury forced 
him to the sideline for the rest of the season. Under Krieg's leadership, the 
Lions have improved to 7-6 and are coming off two consecutive victories, 
including a 35-21 dusting of the Buffalo Bills in which Krieg threw for 351 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Krieg's career has been longer than most, and he's still playing football long 
after tiny Milton College, his alma mater in Wisconsin, folded. 
</P>
<P>
 "That speaks volumes for the man," Esiason said with a grin.

DEFENDANT IN LONG ISLAND TRAIN MASSACRE TO REPRESENT SELF AT TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The man accused of killing six people in a commuter-train massacre was 
declared competent to stand trial Friday, clearing the way for him to represent 
himself and interrogate the survivors in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a spectacle," said lawyer Ron Kuby, who had been 
representing Colin Ferguson. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of Ferguson questioning victims "is so horrible to imagine . . . it 
staggers the imagination," Kuby said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying their client had snapped after years of racial discrimination, 
Ferguson's lawyers had argued that he was incompetent to stand trial in the 
slaughter on the Long Island Rail Road one year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But Nassau County Judge Donald Belfi ruled that Ferguson is competent and can 
represent himself as he has requested. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the judge told Ferguson: "I think you are doing a foolish thing." 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe I could be a formidable opponent to Mr. Peck," replied Ferguson, 
referring to prosecutor George Peck. "I believe I can prove my innocence. I 
believe I can be acquitted." 
</P>
<P>
 Six passengers were killed and 19 others injured on Dec. 7, 1993, by a man who 
calmly stood up and opened fire as the train approached suburban Garden City. 
Amid victims' panic, witnesses said, he reloaded and fired again. Two 
passengers tackled the gunman when he tried to reload a second time. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection is scheduled to begin Jan. 17.

WHAT'S LEFT OF THE FUND? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wall Street brokerages last week sold off $11.4 billion of U.S. government 
securities owned by Orange County's investment fund, all of which were held as 
collateral for loans the brokerages had made to the fund. So how much money 
does that leave in the fund? 
</P>
<P>
 The county won't say, but Wall Street analysts have been trying to guess. 
Here's how the math might work: 
</P>
<P>
 * On Dec. 1, the county said the fund held bonds that would be worth about $20 
billion if held to maturity. But because all bonds have fallen in value this 
year as interest rates have risen, the county said its fund had dropped about 
$1.5 billion in market value. In other words, if sold Dec. 1, the county 
figured the portfolio would have been worth about $18.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 * Given that the brokerages liquidated securities worth $11.4 billion at the 
market last week, the fund in theory should now have a market value of about 
$7.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 * But that $7.1 billion would include about $2.1 billion in bonds purchased on 
credit from Merrill Lynch and DLJ Securities -- the only brokerages that have 
not called in their loans. 
</P>
<P>
 * If those loans were paid off in full, the county fund could hold as little 
as $5 billion now. That would be $2.8 billion less than the $7.8 billion in 
principal the county said has been invested by it and its municipalities. 
</P>
<P>
 * The $2.8-billion decline would represent a 36% loss on the fund's $7.8 
billion in principal -- far worse than the county's 20% loss estimate Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 * But because it is not clear precisely how much in securities was sold last 
week -- or, more important, what the exact value of the bonds remaining in the 
portfolio is -- some Wall Street executives continue to believe that the 
county's original estimate of a $1.5-billion loss may be accurate -- or that 
the loss could be even smaller. TOM PETRUNO

 A dolphin attacked two swimmers who tried to ride it and tie objects to its 
tail, killing one and injuring the other, a newspaper said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Joao Paulo Moreira and Wilson Reis Pedroso were repeatedly head-butted by the 
dolphin while swimming Thursday at a beach in Caraguatatuba, 200 miles 
southwest of Rio, the O Globo newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
 The dolphin, a popular tourist attraction at the beach, was nicknamed "Tiao," 
short for Sebastiao. "We warned people . . . not to approach the dolphin, but 
to let him make the first move," biologist Andre Rossi was quoted as saying.

WRITERS' SPIN MOVES ARE NOT APPRECIATED

 Friday night (Dec. 2), I thought I saw one of the finest football games ever 
seen in Orange County as Mater Dei defeated Los Alamitos. However, after

 Re: Your recent article expressing concern about the Brea-Olinda girls' 
basketball team running up the score. 
</P>
<P>
 The facts demonstrate that The Times prep sports reporters spin a story the 
way they want. In Brea Ball, when the team starts to get ahead, out come the 
starters and in comes a whole different team. If Brea wanted to, as the 
opposing coach stated, it could easily run up the score to 100-plus points 
virtually every game. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Jeff Sink (the coach) should allow the Ladycats to truly run up the 
score one time to silence critics who obviously read the score but don't bother 
to read the stats. What is the Orange County record for most points in a game, 
anyway?

POLICE RETIREES SET HUNTINGTON BEACH RECORD; PERSONNEL: SEVEN OFFICERS JOIN 
ABOUT 50 OTHER WORKERS WHO BECOME PENSIONERS THIS MONTH. CITY HIRINGS HAVE BEEN 
FROZEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THAO HUA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Almost 200 years of law enforcement expertise will be lost this month when 
seven police officers retire, and authorities say they are unsure whether 
replacements will be hired in the midst of Orange County's bankruptcy debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those leaving are one of four captains, an investigation bureau 
commander and a jail manager. The average tenure is 23 years for the soon-to-be 
retirees, according to department records. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have more people retiring this month than any other month in the history 
of the department," Chief Ronald E. Lowenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The department will promote three officers today to fill some of the vacant 
positions, Lt. Gary Brooks said. And the process of sifting through the 
hundreds of applications of potential candidates will continue. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Orange County became the largest governmental body to declare 
bankruptcy earlier this week, all hiring was temporarily suspended, Lowenberg 
said. On top of that, the city's budget already is $912,000 in the red. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure when we will have opportunity to replace these positions," 
Lowenberg said. "Frankly, right now, some folks will have to take on the job of 
two people." 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, city officials said, the officers will join about 50 
other Huntington Beach employees retiring this month. The exodus follows 
controversy that erupted earlier this year over pension spiking, in which 
vacation time, sick pay and other allowances are added to the base salary used 
to determine the retirement pension. The practice was part of a benefit package 
stated in the city's employee contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Councilman Earle Robitaille and city administrators believe that, while 
the controversy was not responsible for the mass retirements, it was an 
influence, because some employees were afraid that the rules would change, 
leading to lower retirement payments. 
</P>
<P>
 In interviews earlier this week, four of seven retiring officers said the 
pension-spiking brouhaha was not the deciding factor but made their decisions 
easier. Three officers couldn't be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just my time to go," said Lt. John Foster, who was in charge of the 
department's investigations of murder, rape and other violent crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster has spent 24 years with Huntington Beach police and five years in 
Compton as a patrolman. He said he's glad to get away from the violent crimes, 
some too horrible to tell. But he'll miss the "feeling that at times, you are 
the difference between the criminal and the people," Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
 A native Californian, Foster said he settled in Huntington Beach after joining 
the city's police force in the early 1960s, when the beach community was 
nestled between "bean fields and corn fields." 
</P>
<P>
 "There would be two to three days when we wouldn't get a call," Foster said. 
"I told myself, 'Oh my, maybe I've done the wrong thing by coming here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But the peace and quiet didn't last long. Even the beach parties became 
occasionally violent, Foster said, along with the other crimes that accompanied 
a growing population. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he has been scared plenty of times, said Foster, now 51. He has 
been shot at in the dark; he has wrestled with drunken criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 But what hurts more, what makes Foster's eyes well up, is the 11-year-old girl 
who confessed that her dad had raped her and that her mother had done nothing 
about it. Or the 80-year-old mother who called him to arrest her son, who had 
beaten her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it's hard to be strong," he said. "But you know that the people 
depend on you to be the strength in their time of weakness. So you take it all 
in and let it stay there." 
</P>
<P>
 Foster and the other retiring officers take records of bravery and 
accomplishment with them, Lowenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Darrell Klopp, for instance, earned a medal of valor in the 1970s after 
confronting an armed suspect in a shootout, police Lt. Chuck Poe said. 
Investigator Augie Frost helped catch a thief who took about $200,000 worth of 
electronics from 50 boats in Huntington Harbour. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way to completely make up for that much experience," Robitaille 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Bob Moran, another retiring officer, led the effort in contracting with 
other cities to book inmates in Huntington Beach's jail. The move put about 
$250,000 in the city coffers annually, Lowenberg said. He also started a 
program to deter students from bringing drugs and guns to school by having dogs 
search the lockers and classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would tell (police officer) candidates that, if you're getting into law 
enforcement as a job, then don't," Moran said. "But if you get into it as a 
career, it's the greatest career. This has never been a job to me, it's always 
been a way of life." 
</P>
<P>
 Klopp, 54, arrived in Huntington Beach 28 years ago, when the city and the 
Police Department was about one third the size they are today, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In those days, they required us to live in town," Klopp said. "So I bought a 
house here, and I've been here ever since." 
</P>
<P>
 After retirement, Klopp said, he plans to spend a lot more time on his 32-foot 
boat named Gee-Whiz in Long Beach. Moran said he will do everything his wife 
tells him to do. And Frost will get another job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want a part-time job at a golf course," he said. "But I'll probably end up 
in security or law enforcement again." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever they do after this year, the officers know one thing for sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "You carry everything with you -- the elderly left alone to die in filth, the 
burn marks, the tears when children look to the parents who abused them (and) 
then cry when you try to take them away -- you take it all with you," Foster 
said. "Then you drive away in your car."

HEARTFELT GRATITUDE; PARENTS RECOGNIZE SACRIFICE BY OTHERS LET THEIR SON THRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

 Lori Sullivan watches with pleasure as her 17-month-old son, Trent, smiles at 
himself in a mirror, then reaches for the bright orange nose on a puppet. Each 
squeal of delight from the brown-haired boy widens the smile on Sullivan's 
face. 
</P>
<P>
 Trent's actions are hardly unique, but Sullivan will never tire of watching 
the youngest of her three children perform the most ordinary tasks. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, Sullivan and her husband, Craig, wondered if Trent's body would ever be 
free of the machinery that kept blood circulating through his veins and oxygen 
pumping through his lungs. But today, exactly one year after Trent underwent a 
heart transplant, the Sullivans and their two other children, Garrett, 7, and 
Jaclyn, 5, are finally ready to celebrate a dream come true. They will do so, 
however, knowing that their dream was realized only because another family's 
nightmare came true. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your throat drops to your stomach when you realize someone else's child died 
to save yours," Lori Sullivan said. "I will never think of Trent without being 
reminded of their gift." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Craig Sullivan: "My overwhelming feeling was gratitude that the other 
parents cared enough about children they could do this, let something good come 
out of (their) child's death."  
</P>
<P>
 Just 27 inches tall and weighing less than 17 pounds, Trent is about the size 
of an average 8-month-old child. His gross motor skills are far below the norm 
for someone his age, and he lags behind in other developmental areas as well. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the help of physical therapy sessions three times a week, Trent has 
developed to the point that he can sit up unassisted and can say several 
phrases. He has gained almost a pound a month since he received his new heart 
and has become much more alert and responsive. "When he come home after the 
transplant, he was basically a newborn," the mother said. "When you consider 
that, he has really come a long way." 
</P>
<P>
 The first signs that something was wrong with Trent came moments after he was 
born at Placentia Linda Community Hospital on July 9, 1993. The obstetrician 
noticed the boy was having difficulty breathing and had poor skin color. 
</P>
<P>
 Trent was transferred by ambulance to Children's Hospital of Orange County, 
where doctors discovered he had a condition called pneumothorax, which is 
caused by a hole in one of his lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the diagnosis came as a relief, because such holes often heal 
without treatment. But after it became apparent that Trent's hole wasn't 
healing, a tube was inserted into his chest. It was then that doctors 
discovered Trent's heart was not working properly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a real shock," said Craig Sullivan. "With two other healthy kids, you 
just never think something could go wrong. It's something that happens to other 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 After Trent spent three weeks in the neonatal intensive care unit, the 
Sullivans finally took home their 6-pound baby, along with a list of 
heart-failure symptoms to look for. 
</P>
<P>
 Four months later, Trent was readmitted to CHOC after Lori Sullivan detected 
six of the symptoms she'd been watching for each day. For the next 10 days, 
Trent was hooked up to a heart and lung bypass machine. On Dec. 9, the 
Sullivans decided to place Trent on a national organ recipient list. Less than 
six hours later, they got the call that a heart had been found. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first thing that races through your mind is that somewhere a baby has 
died," Lori Sullivan said. "But then I just had to focus on Trent. Maybe this 
would mean our baby will live." 
</P>
<P>
 Trent was transferred to Loma Linda Medical Center in Riverside, where a team 
of surgeons removed his tiny, malformed heart and replaced it with one that had 
been removed just hours earlier from an infant in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 All that the Sullivans know about the donor family's situation is that the 
child was within two months of Trent's age. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sent them a thank-you letter with a picture of Trent so they could see how 
well he is doing," Lori Sullivan said. "We haven't heard back from them but I 
like to think my letter has helped them, even if just a little." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sullivans will celebrate today with a party to mark what they call Trent's 
"rebirthday" and the fact that by going a full year without rejecting the new 
heart, their son has a good chance of leading a normal life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big hurdle to clear," said Dr. Jon Kramer, Trent's pediatrician. "The 
longer he goes without rejection, the better his chances are. At this point 
he's doing great." 
</P>
<P>
 As pleased as he is with the milestone, Craig Sullivan has his own in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking forward to the day when I can take him snow skiing," Sullivan 
said. "When I can put him on skis with Garrett and Jaclyn, that would be a big 
deal."

6 GROUPS OPPOSE BOYCOTT AGAINST DISNEY, NABISCO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six prominent Latino and labor organizations voiced opposition Friday to a 
planned boycott of Walt Disney Co. and RJR Nabisco over their financial support 
for Gov. Pete Wilson and other pro-Proposition 187 candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Boycott opponents convened at the main entrance to Disneyland, where they 
announced they would devote their energies to promoting U.S. citizenship among 
Latinos rather than bad-mouthing corporate giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the groups were vehemently opposed to Proposition 187, which won by 
nearly a 3-2 ratio at the polls, they said a boycott could lead to more harm. 
</P>
<P>
 "This boycott is not about justice," said Michael Potts, a representative of 
the Orange County Building Trades Council. "It's just a case of blind rage that 
will pit working people against working people." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angela Keefe, president of the union that represents some Disneyland and 
Disneyland Hotel employees: "All (the boycott) will do is force our members -- 
50% of whom are immigrant workers -- to stay home with no wages and benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 A day earlier, activists from grass-roots immigrants rights organizations had 
met at the same site to unveil their boycott plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are asking people not to heed the call made by small, insignificant groups 
and individuals that don't have the broad-based support of the Latino 
community," said Nativo V. Lopez, co-national director of Hermandad Mexicana 
Nacional, one of the groups opposed to the boycott. 
</P>
<P>
 "In seeking to respond to Prop. 187, organizations have to focus their 
attention on launching citizenship projects . . . to encourage Latinos to come 
forward and adopt the United States as their permanent home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The statewide ballot measure, approved overwhelmingly last month, would deny 
education, social services and non-emergency health care to illegal immigrants. 
A federal court judge has temporarily blocked its implementation. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of the boycott, meanwhile, said the latest developments would not 
alter their plans to stop buying Nabisco products or spending money at Disney 
films and businesses. The immigration rights groups today plan to demonstrate 
outside the main gate of the theme park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't support companies that support Pete Wilson, who is the No. 1 enemy 
of the Latino community," said Fabian Nunez of La Alianza, a community advocacy 
group in Pomona. "The purpose of our boycott is to send messages to businesses 
that Latino immigrants, through their spending power, won't support politicians 
who support racist policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "These groups saying they stand with Disney need to rethink their strategies." 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland spokesman John McClintock said the company, which did not take a 
stand on Proposition 187, is "gratified" that other groups have come to its 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt the boycott was unjust because we supported both candidates running 
for governor," McClintock said. "We're very proud of our longstanding 
relationship with the Hispanic American community, and we've done a lot of work 
to help our employees." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Disneyland has no formal citizenship promotion programs in place, 
McClintock said corporate officials are discussing that possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Hermandad Mexicana Nacional and the building trades council, 
other groups opposed to the boycott are the League of United Latin American 
Citizens of California, the Hotel Employees and Restaurant Employees Union 
Local 681, the Orange County Central Labor Council and Los Amigos of Orange 
County.

5 HURT AT CLINIC AS PRESSURIZED CHAMBER BLOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN ELLINGWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five people were injured Friday when a pressurized chamber used to treat 
stroke victims exploded at a medical clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Two people who were sitting in the hyperbaric chamber sustained injuries 
similar to the bends suffered by divers who ascend too quickly, said Emmy Day, 
a spokeswoman for the Orange County Fire Department.The chamber, which is a 
pressurized tank used to increase the supply of oxygen to the brain, suddenly 
lost pressure in the explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other people in a nearby waiting area of the Health Restoration Center 
were struck by flying debris, including chunks of the heavy plastic chamber 
door, Day said. One of them suffered a skull fracture, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The doors and windows rattled," said Bruce Johnson, a commercial real estate 
broker who works nearby in the complex. "I heard bang and thought it was a car 
accident. It sounded like that."  
</P>
<P>
 The five injured people, all in their 50s and 60s, were in stable condition at 
Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo. Their names were not 
immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators had not determined the cause of the 5:53 p.m. explosion in a 
business park in the 22000 block of Aspan Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic provides outpatient care for stroke patients, many of whom live in 
the Leisure World retirement community nearby in Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber that exploded was one of three at the clinic. Two patients in the 
other chambers were not injured, Day said. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients spend two hours in the chambers, where the pressure is twice that of 
the normal atmosphere, Day said. Hyperbaric chambers also are used to supply 
pure oxygen to burn victims, skin divers and people who have suffered carbon 
monoxide poisoning, she said.

ARREST IN SLAYING FOLLOWS GRISLY DISCOVERY; CRIME: MAN IS JAILED ON SUSPICION 
OF KILLING HUNTINGTON WOMAN, 47, AFTER CAR CRASH. BODY WAS FOUND IN CAR PARKED 
OUTSIDE IRVINE HOSPITAL. 
</P>

 A Minnesota electrician is being held in connection with the slaying of a 
Huntington Beach woman who had stopped to talk to him following a traffic 
accident and was beaten to death with a wrench at the side of Pacific Coast 
Highway in broad daylight, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard James Patton, 29, of St. Anthony, Minn., was arrested on suspicion of 
murder and kidnaping hours after the body of Jessica Ellen Uniack was 
discovered Thursday under a pile of blankets and clothes in the passenger seat 
of her Toyota Land Cruiser, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was being held at County Jail in lieu of $250,000 bail, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't think right now, I still can't believe what happened," Bill Uniack, 
the victim's husband of 20 years, said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 47-year-old mother of two children was on the way to deliver homemade 
coconut cookies to a friend across town when she apparently collided with a 
van, said Sandra Clouse, her best friend. Police said the attack occurred on 
Pacific Coast Highway near Seal Beach Boulevard sometime after 9:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Uniack and the driver of the van apparently exchanged names and addresses for 
insurance purposes, said Irvine Police Lt. Sam Allevato. Police found Patton's 
name and address and the license plate number of the rented van written on a 
piece of paper in Uniack's car. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators believe the man had struck Uniack's vehicle, then attacked her 
with a lug wrench after she pulled over to the side of the road, said Irvine 
police Sgt. Dwight Henninger. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators have yet to establish a motive for the killing, Henninger said. 
</P>
<P>
 The assailant left his van at the side of the road and drove Uniack in her 
vehicle to the back entrance of Irvine Medical Center in the 16200 block of 
Sand Canyon Avenue, where he abandoned the vehicle with the engine running and 
fled on foot, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 A nurse saw that the vehicle was blocking the emergency entrance and called a 
security guard about 11:30 a.m., police said. The security guard moved the 
vehicle to the parking lot, where he found Uniack's body while searching for an 
identification, hospital officials said. He called the police, and a search for 
a suspect was launched. 
</P>
<P>
 About 7:30 p.m. Thursday, a motorist saw a "suspicious-looking" man walking 
north on Newport Coast Drive and notified police, Allevato said. When officers 
arrived, they arrested Patton, Allevato said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, Patton also was arrested in September on suspicion of car 
theft in Ft. Worth, Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Family members and friends Friday mourned the death of Uniack, who was 
remembered as a woman with whom everyone shared their problems and secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 She arrived in Huntington Beach in 1974 from Milwaukee, Wis., for a job 
interview and fell in love with the man who interviewed her. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Uniack, who interviewed her for a sales position at his company, said, "I 
gave her the job, but she only worked for about a week. We both knew her 
working there wasn't going to work out." 
</P>
<P>
 The two were married three months later. They have two sons. Billy, 18, is a 
general education major at the University of Boston, and Alex, 15, is a 
freshman at Servite Catholic School in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides always being there for her family, Clouse said, Jessica Uniack took in 
stray dogs, cats and birds. Two of her pets died earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a Humane Society around here," Clouse said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1984 Summer Olympics, Uniack helped coordinate the yacht race in 
Long Beach. She also directed the Huntington Beach youth sailing program and 
was a board member of the national Family Strengthen America, a nonprofit group 
that provides family and drug counseling. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was the glue that held everything together," Clouse said. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral arrangements were pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are asking that anyone with information about the crime should call 
(714) 724-7174.

PLAY REFLECTS PAINFUL ERA; W W II VETERAN FINDS POIGNANCY IN STORY ABOUT 
CHRISTMAS IN DETENTION CAMPS 
</P>

<P>
 Harold Harada won the Bronze Star in World War II when the Japanese American 
served as a medic in bloody fighting across Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 But back in this country, his mother, his father, and his wife-to-be were all 
living behind bars -- simply because they were Japanese Americans. Even Harada 
was forced to live in that same desert internment camp for almost two years 
before he was allowed to join the Army. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tears came to my eyes to see barbed wire, guard towers and soldiers with 
machine guns guarding us," Harada said. "We said the Pledge of Allegiance 
almost every day and learned American history. But the camps really brought out 
the feeling that we were different . . . that we were the enemy." 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty years later, the retired Culver City dentist and his wife, Chiye, are 
seeing their painful wartime lives mirrored on stage in a play at the Japanese 
American National Museum in Downtown Los Angeles. "A Jivebomber's Christmas," 
which ends Sunday, is set in an internment camp similar to the one Harada and 
his family were taken to in Topaz, Utah. In the play, a brother goes off to war 
to fight for this country while his relatives in the camp struggle to keep up 
their spirits during the Christmas holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street from the museum is an original barracks from the internment 
camp in Heart Mountain, Wyo., that was dismantled and transported to the museum 
by a group of Japanese Americans who once lived there. 
</P>
<P>
 Saachiko Magwili, a co-writer and co-director of the play, was 3 when she, her 
mother and her sister were taken to the Heart Mountain camp. Both her uncles 
served in the same segregated battalions as Harada, helping to form the most 
decorated unit in U.S. military history. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you celebrate Christmas and (be in a relocation) camp?" Magwili asked. 
"You're talking about a heart with barbed wire around it."  
</P>
<P>
 During the war about 30,000 Japanese Americans served in the U.S. military and 
about 120,000 lived in the internment camps. "I lost both my parents in camp," 
Harada, 71, said. "But the good thing is I met my wife and I've been married to 
her for 46 years." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As Harada watched a rehearsal of the play Wednesday night he recalled with 
some sadness what it was like for him and his family during the war. "The camp 
story needs to be told and retold," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to prove their loyalty, the Niseis, or second-generation Japanese 
Americans, enlisted after answering "yes, yes" to two questions asking if they 
would renounce any allegiance to Japan and if they would fight for the United 
States. Harada answered in the affirmative but felt disheartened by the 
questions because two-thirds of the internees were born in America and most had 
no allegiance to Japan.  
</P>
<P>
 The few hundred who refused to join were nicknamed "no, no boys" by the 
Japanese American community because they answered no to the loyalty questions.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was upsetting that they were out fighting for freedom when we didn't have 
any back home," said Chiye Harada, 73. Even though she was upset about living 
in the prison-like conditions, Chiye Harada said she never felt that "it was a 
permanent situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Letters from the separated loved ones sustained them, Harada said. The play 
often uses letters to tell its story. "This is no adventure, this is hell," one 
soldier writes his family in a camp. "It's thinking of you guys that's getting 
me through." 
</P>
<P>
 During the war, Harada said, he and his wife shared emotions like that about 
once a week.  
</P>
<P>
 "One of the reasons the 100th Infantry Battalion and 442nd Regimental Combat 
Team was so valiant in combat was because they thought of their families who 
were incarcerated," Harada said. "They needed to prove by their daring feats 
that the government was wrong in incarcerating American citizens. They wanted 
to show their citizenship by making the supreme sacrifice so that the U.S. and 
all nations would be rid of bigotry, prejudice and discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
 Actor Darrell Kunitomi still reads the letters his uncle wrote from the front 
lines and said he uses them for inspiration as he plays two roles, that of a 
442nd soldier who agreed to join the U.S. Army and a "no, no boy" who refused.  
</P>
<P>
 "What they did is hard for somebody in the 1990s to grasp, especially for 
those born in the age of Vietnam and Watergate," Kunitomi said. 
</P>
<P>
 His 18-year-old uncle was killed in the fighting while his parents were 
interned at Heart Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 "They stepped out behind barbed wire and literally marched off to war and then 
engaged in some of the most ferocious fighting with unbelievable casualties," 
Kunitomi said. "That was an era when you believed in causes and you were 
willing to go out there and lose your lives over it."  
</P>
<P>
 That spirit has made the veterans icons in the Asian community. Many credit 
their bravery with influencing the eventual overturning of anti-Asian laws that 
until 1954 did not allow Japanese immigrants to become U.S. citizens. Their 
testimony before Congress in 1988 helped persuade the government to award those 
interned redress payments. 
</P>
<P>
 "War has no glory as far as I'm concerned," Harada said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the acceptance of not only Japanese Americans but all Asians after 
the war was better," he said. "It came about mainly because of those men who 
made the supreme sacrifice. But I believe the stoicism of those interned, the 
young as well as the old, (contributed) to the acceptance of Japanese 
Americans, and all the Americans."

 Steve Burnham reaches into the rear of the aging school bus, and grabs a 
toddler's potty-training toilet. "Oops . . . let me get rid of this," he says 
apologetically. "I don't want this to be the first thing people get a whiff 
of." 
</P>
<P>
 The scent of alpine firs, however, is what hits the curious who approach 
Burnham's dingy 1967 Dodge school bus in the parking lot of the Duck Pond 
liquor store in West Los Angeles. The bus is one of the more eclectic stories 
of Christmas commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 On the corner of Palms Boulevard and Overland Avenue, Burnham is selling the 
Christmas trees he drives here every year from Idaho. The bus is not merely his 
tree hauler. Decorated with scraggly colored lights, it's also a temporary home 
for Burnham, 34, his wife, Kat, 21, their daughters Alicia, 2, and Kara, 1, and 
a cockapoo named Venus.  
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago the couple loaded up the school bus with cans of baked beans and 
vegetables, blankets, a crib and 600 trees and drove here from Bonners Ferry, a 
small Idaho town near the Canadian border. 
</P>
<P>
 Burnham had recently been fired from his job at a wood factory. He and his 
wife went into their savings and paid the government $2,400 (at $4 per tree) 
for the right to cut down 600 trees in a national forest 75 miles north of 
Coeur d'Alene, Ida.  
</P>
<P>
 "I used the chain saw, and my wife tied up the trees," said Burnham. It took 
the pair a week, working from 7 a.m. to 9 p.m. in near-freezing temperatures, 
to get the trees.  
</P>
<P>
 The alpine firs from the national forest grow at an elevation of 8,000 feet, 
which Burnham says makes them superior to the ones grown on Christmas tree 
farms.  
</P>
<P>
 "When the frost hits the trees, the needles sink into the branches and (it) 
makes the trees more resilient," Burnham says. 
</P>
<P>
 The road to L.A. this time was hard. Driving a 35-foot bus full of 600 trees 
for a thousand miles took three days. The couple had to replace the 
transmission during the trip, and the fuel pump broke a few miles outside of 
Portland. Obviously, school buses are made for lighter loads. 
</P>
<P>
 "Driving this is harder than driving a semi," Burnham said. "It was quite an 
odyssey." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This is the eighth year Burnham has driven down to Los Angeles to sell trees. 
Over the years he has forged a relationship with Joon Kyung Suh, owner of the 
Duck Pond liquor store.  
</P>
<P>
 "My brother-in-law always told me he's (Burnham) a good guy," said Sandy 
Chang, who is running the liquor store while Suh is studying acupuncture in 
China. Suh allowed the family to sell trees on their lot, said Chang, "because 
we knew they needed the money." 
</P>
<P>
 Chang said she lets the family use her bathroom facilities and electricity. 
She also gave the Burnhams a heavy wool blanket. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I see them outside, my heart goes out to them," said Chang.  
</P>
<P>
 Some cynical customers ask Chang whether she's getting a cut of the money the 
Burnhams make. No, she says, she's just letting them use the lot. The Burnhams 
are a welcome addition to her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I help them, I feel better," she said. "And their trees smell very 
good." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On a windy day earlier this week the gusts were knocking down Burnham's 
smaller trees, so he spent most of his time anchoring the wooden tree stands 
with bricks. His young wife entertained the children, and Venus the dog barked 
at strangers who tried to steal trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Business has been pretty good. Burnham says he usually sells 10 trees on 
weekdays, and up to 15 on the weekends. Prices range from $8 for the two-foot 
trees to $35 for the taller ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Burnham sometimes cuts his profit margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Chicas picked a lush six-foot tree, priced at $35. But Carlos, 13, was 
$9 short. "I told him I didn't have enough money, so he gave it to me for $26," 
Carlos said. "He's a kind man."  
</P>
<P>
 Natalia Mallahi fell in love with a two-foot tree, which she plans to place in 
her baby's room. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better to buy from people like this than the rip-off artists," said 
Mallahi, who lives around the corner from Burnham's lot. Although she hadn't 
shopped around much, the school bus and the homemade feel of the lot drew her 
there, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a guy who's trying to support his family. He's not on welfare," 
Mallahi said. "I'm all for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Burnham figures his family will earn $2,500 this season and head back to Idaho 
the day after Christmas. When he gets back he'll buy toys for his two girls. 
Living in the bus, said his wife, is no big deal for a couple that bought a 
house in the northern Idaho woods last year that has no running water.  
</P>
<P>
 Taking a shower in the morning in the Duck Pond parking lot, said Kat, means 
"putting on a bathing suit and getting hosed down. It's kind of cold at first, 
but you get used to it."  
</P>
<P>
 So although the traffic of Palms Boulevard is a little annoying for a family 
that lives in the woods, Burnham insists that Los Angeles isn't the frenzied 
metropolis that ex-Angelenos he's met in Idaho make it out to be.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of really nice people here," he said.

ARCHDIOCESE CRITICIZED OVER SEXUAL ABUSE CASE; CLERGY: POLICE SAY CHURCH HAS 
WITHHELD NAMES OF FORMER LONG BEACH PRIEST'S POSSIBLE VICTIMS. CHURCH SAYS IT 
IS TRYING TO PROTECT CONFIDENTIALITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Long Beach police detective complained Friday that the Roman Catholic 
Archdiocese of Los Angeles has been withholding key information that could 
strengthen a criminal investigation of alleged sexual abuse by a priest. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Mike Holguin said at least 10 young men have accused Father Theodore 
Llanos of sexual abuse over a period of several years. However, Holguin said, 
church officials have declined to give police a list of potential victims at 
Llanos' former parish, St. Lucy's Church in west Long Beach. He said that 
although police have interviewed some alleged victims, there may be others who 
have not come forward because of embarrassment or fear of reprisal. 
</P>
<P>
 The archdiocese removed Llanos from his post in September after a young man 
alleged that he had been sexually abused by the priest while a parishioner at 
St. Barnabas Church in the Long Beach community of Bixby Knolls, where Llanos 
served from 1985 to 1989.  
</P>
<P>
 Llanos, who was ordained in 1974, is now in a residential psychological 
treatment facility in Maryland that cares for the clergy. No charges have been 
filed against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Church officials said that when Llanos was removed, he turned over a list of 
at least 10 victims. The Rev. Gregory Coiro, director of public affairs for the 
Los Angeles Archdiocese, said the church has declined to give the list to 
police because it feels obligated to protect the identity of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been our position all along that we would cooperate with the police," 
Coiro said. "But we cannot do that by trampling on the rights and 
confidentiality of our parishioners." 
</P>
<P>
 Holguin said his department would not release any of the names of the victims 
unless they ask the agency to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy is the latest in a growing number of cases that have forced 
the Catholic Church to dramatically step up its efforts to deal with sexual 
abuse by priests. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishops in the United States in 1993, for example, asked the Vatican to allow 
them greater leeway in removing guilty priests from ministries where they could 
pose a threat to children or women they may have victimized. The Vatican 
approved most of the bishops' requests. 
</P>
<P>
 Most dioceses have adopted written policies to quickly adjudicate charges of 
sexual abuse against priests and to extend counseling and other assistance to 
victims and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 A committee of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops last month urged 
all local dioceses to adopt such policies and offered recommendations to 
strengthen existing policies. Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles is a 
member of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Pope John Paul II called the continuing reports of priestly sexual 
abuse a scandal within the church after U.S. bishops raised the issue with him 
privately. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of the increasing number of cases, archdiocese spokesman Coiro said, 
psychological tests performed in the local seminary training for priests have 
begun to place more emphasis on candidates' sexual attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 Coiro said St. Lucy's has brought in counselors and therapists to help 
parishioners deal with the incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Father Tom Economus, the head of a national group representing victims abused 
by Catholic priests, Friday called on Mahony to support the police 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Cardinal Mahony has a moral obligation to the victims, their families 
and the church," Economus said. "He also has an obligation to Father Llanos, 
who seems to be a very troubled man."

CHURCH HOPES PLAN FOR CEMETERY ENDS HOMEOWNER FEUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NICHOLAS RICCARDI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 West Valley Christian Church hopes a new plan for land the congregation owns 
in West Hills will make its long quarrel with a homeowners group there a dead 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the West Hills Neighborhood Assn. has battled to keep the 
congregation from building a church on a five-acre tract it bought for $2.2 
million in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 So now the church has a new proposed use for the site -- a cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, that does "address a lot of our issues, like traffic, grading, activity 
at night (and) bell-ringing," said homeowners association board member Barbara 
Kay. 
</P>
<P>
 Church and homeowners association leaders alike are tentatively optimistic 
that replacing live worshipers with the remains of the departed will end their 
lengthy quarrel, but it remains to be seen whether the association's membership 
will agree. 
</P>
<P>
 The feud dates back to 1992, when the congregation proposed building a church 
and school on the triangular parcel of hillside land bounded by Roscoe 
Boulevard and Woodlake Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents, who complained the school would create traffic nightmares and 
require grading the hill, flocked to city zoning board meetings to block the 
project. One meeting ran a record seven hours. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the City Council approved construction of a combination 
church-nursery school, smaller than the original proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents worried the nursery school could be expanded into a larger 
facility, and the association sued the city, demanding that an environmental 
impact report be required for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not the way to go," Mel Malkoff, a consultant to the church, said in 
reference to the legal brouhaha. "We would like to work with (the residents) 
arm in arm." 
</P>
<P>
 And so, meeting with the Neighborhood Assn. board in August, the church 
presented plans for a cemetery. The church and school will be built on another 
site, Malkoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of what may be several meetings to gauge neighborhood response was 
held Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents seemed startled by the grave proposal, Kay said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is up to the membership," Kay said. The association is not formally 
endorsing the plan until after it canvasses its members, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The church, she said, has promised to pull the project if the residents oppose 
it.

HOPE AND THE HOPEFUL; COMEDIAN WOWS HIS PUBLIC AT AUTOGRAPH SESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like a writhing snake, the line of the hopeful coiled around the $100 perfume 
displays, past the cosmetics counter and out into the mall. Some had waited at 
the Bullock's in Sherman Oaks for three hours Friday, sure that what they 
sought could not be bought at any price: 
</P>
<P>
 A brush with Hope. Bob Hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the celebrity autograph signing, where elevator rides become 
adventures, memories are carried away in shopping bags and film legends shine 
in a glow of affection brighter than any silver screen. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 91-year-old Hope and his wife, Dolores, the mission was as calculated 
as the invasion of Normandy. Coordinated by hand-held radio, the couple would 
storm the Sherman Oaks Fashion Square at 1300 hours, where they would wow 
autograph hounds during a promotion of their new Christmas album, "Hopes for 
the Holidays," and the comedian's own memoirs, "Bob Hope Remembers . . . World 
War II -- The European Theatre & D-Day." 
</P>
<P>
 But the comedy began even before Hope grabbed the microphone. 
</P>
<P>
 As the couple made their way to the stage, a stubborn elevator stopped at 
every floor. Each time the doors opened, the Hopes and their entourage were 
greeted with the same sight: a wide-eyed mother with her baby in a stroller -- 
a different one on each floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a comedy bit," Hope quipped after the third mother disappeared behind 
the elevator doors. "I've never seen anything like it." 
</P>
<P>
 When the entourage finally spilled out of the elevator, three elderly women 
recognized the star in his tennis shoes and green sport coat, but still found 
their memories challenged. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was he singing?" one woman whispered as the comedian strolled by. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't remember," replied her friend. 
</P>
<P>
 The third woman thought momentarily, then snapped her fingers. "He was 
singing, 'I Remember,' " she said triumphantly. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Hope reached the stage -- a makeshift platform in the cosmetics 
section -- the line awaiting him had nearly turned into a mob of gray-haired 
groupies. Some were decidedly younger -- at least in their 30s -- and they 
tried to reach through the line of security guards and mall staff to shake 
hands with the show-biz great. 
</P>
<P>
 But there would be no stampede here. A smirking Hope took command of the 
microphone with the skill that quelled rambunctious troops during his overseas 
performances with the USO. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want you to know I don't own this store," Hope told the crowd. "I own 
the chain -- I don't own this store." 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody stopped at the sound of his voice. Then the comedian looked at the 
photo of himself and Dolores that they would soon be autographing. "That's what 
we're going to sign?" he asked. "Hey, I'm glad they retouched it." 
</P>
<P>
 The audience laughed again, prompting Dolores to get into the act. She poked 
fun at her husband's globe-trotting years with the USO. Although the couple has 
been married for 60 years, she said, "he has only been home three weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it was memories of Hope's USO tours that drew many fans to the event. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first was Kathy Wayland of Orange, whose husband was engaged in 
combat in Vietnam when Hope performed there for the troops in 1968. Her 
husband, Mark, had to work Friday and was unable to make the trip to Sherman 
Oaks, where Kathy and neighbor Ginny Burger waited three hours to shake hands 
with the celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband never got to see you, but he wanted me to say 'Thank you,' " 
Wayland told Hope as she clutched her 21-month-old daughter, Katie. 
</P>
<P>
 Stacey Knight of Long Beach waited in line with her two sisters to ask Hope to 
sign a picture of himself and Knight's father taken in France when the World 
War II peace was signed. Her father, 80-year-old Alfred Nathan, now lives in a 
Florida retirement home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it would be a nice Christmas gift for my dad from his grandson," 
Knight said while holding her son, 3-month-old Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Hope didn't hear Knight and the others explain why they had come. Or 
perhaps he was too busy, signing like crazy, to follow. But just being in his 
presence was all they wanted, and they left beaming. 
</P>
<P>
 As at most celebrity autograph sessions, however, there were plenty of fans 
who were more interested in taking home a piece of the legend. 
</P>
<P>
 Billie Nelson Tyrell, who owns more than 500 autographed celebrity dolls, 
smuggled in a doll of the comedian, hoping to get it signed.  
</P>
<P>
 "They told me he wouldn't sign it," the Studio City woman said. "That he was 
only signing the photographs. I stuck it in my purse and pulled it out when I 
got up there. He signed it on the back. He really seemed to like it." 
</P>
<P>
 And one man lined up to see how Hope would react just to looking at his face. 
Pat Ryan, 68, of West Hills won a celebrity look-alike contest a few years ago 
for looking like Hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get people stopping me all the time asking me if I'm Hope," said Ryan, a 
retired sportswriter. On Thanksgiving a man at a Malibu restaurant bet a 
companion $50 that Ryan was Hope. He lost. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Hope didn't seem to care either way. As Ryan shook his hand and 
cameras flashed, Hope merely smiled, signed and looked toward the next 
autograph seeker. 
</P>
<P>
 It had been a long day for the Hopes, who earlier had helped celebrate the 
80th birthday of Hope's perennial co-star, Dorothy Lamour. During a brief 
ceremony on the Universal Studios back lot, a Parisian-style street was renamed 
rue de Lamour. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hope was clearly enjoying his day. He said he is already looking forward 
to signing autographs on his 100th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked what album he might release for that momentous occasion, he just 
smiled and said: "Anything that keeps me standing up." 
</P>

BARKING UP WRONG TREE; U.S. RANGERS TRY TO CATCH THOSE WHO CUT CHRISTMAS 
CONIFER IN FOREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BORIS YARO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forest Service Ranger William Shaw grinned as he slung a five-foot section of 
a Coulter pine tree onto his shoulder and heaved it into the back of his truck. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't happy that the tree, really the top third of a 15-foot pine, had 
been hacked off by someone who wanted a free Christmas tree. Shaw was grinning 
because this time he had a suspect. And he knew where to find him. 
</P>
<P>
 People chop down trees in federal forests every Christmas. Often they get 
away. But on this recent afternoon, Shaw was certain he would find the vandal 
and make him pay for his crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of a Caltrans truck traveling down the Angeles Crest Highway above 
La Canada had seen the tree being cut and noted the license number of the 
cutter's vehicle. He also called Shaw, but by the time the ranger arrived, the 
suspects were gone and the cut portion of the tree was lying abandoned along 
the roadway under the shadows of 80-million-year-old Mt. Josephine. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is gonna be an expensive tree," Shaw said of his first tree stealing 
case of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The fine for cutting a tree in the forest is $100. "Then an additional fine of 
triple the tree's value is assessed and it is assessed for the whole tree, not 
just the part that was cut off," he said. "This tree has a value of $100, so 
the fine will be $300, and then add the $100 for the initial cut and you've got 
an expensive tree." 
</P>
<P>
 Not to mention that you will not be able to keep the tree. He said cut trees 
that are confiscated are usually donated to convalescent hospitals and senior 
citizen homes. 
</P>
<P>
 When caught, most people tell rangers they thought the trees would be free. 
Shaw said later that he was able to contact the people who were in the car 
spotted by the Caltrans worker and that one person admitted cutting the Coulter 
pine. 
</P>
<P>
 The scraggly treetop Shaw found is what another ranger laughingly called a 
"Charlie Brown tree." 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have many fir trees since we are at a lower elevation, but of the 
ones we do have, some of them reach 40 foot tall," said Ranger Glenn Skaggs of 
the Forest Service's Bear Divide Station in Canyon Country. 
</P>
<P>
 "And occasionally one will get topped by thieves because from the ground the 
tip of the tree looks good. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they get the scraggly tip of the tree down to ground level and realize 
it's not as full as a groomed Christmas tree, they dump it. It's like cutting 
the tail off of a dog. It just doesn't look right," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Still, we get folks taking trees every year," said Steve Bear, resource 
officer at the Tujunga Ranger District office in Little Tujunga Canyon above 
Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't get hundreds of people, we get dozens, at least those that we catch 
or find the stumps," said Bear. 
</P>
<P>
 There are five ranger districts in Angeles National Forest, which covers 
694,187 acres of land, from Mt. Baldy westward through Saugus to Los Padres 
National Forest boundary near Pyramid Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 people a year are caught cutting trees in the Angeles National 
Forest, according to Forest Service spokeswoman Dianne Cahir. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said the problem is bigger than the numbers "because the numbers just 
represent those that we manage to catch. More get away." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our trees are for wildlife habitats, recreation and erosion control, which 
makes them much more valuable than for the temporary use as Christmas trees. 
Not to mention it takes a long time to grow a tree," said Bear. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bear's district, there are sections of the forest called "tree 
plantations," where the Forest Service has planted a variety of indigenous 
trees, including Douglas fir, lodge, white and sugar pine. More than 100 of 
such plantations cover several thousand acres of forest -- and they too are 
violated by ax-wielding Christmas tree hunters. 
</P>
<P>
 After Christmas, the Forest Service sometimes encounters an entirely different 
tree problem. Cahir said a lot of well-meaning people call every year saying 
they bought living trees and want to donate them to the Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people even plant their living Christmas trees in the woods, and rangers 
usually find about 10 to 20 non-native trees each year after the holidays. Many 
such trees are ornamental, such as Colorado spruce, and do not adapt to 
Southern California's soil and weather conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We notice them because they are dead," Shaw said. "I find trees planted in 
developed areas. Some people come back and actually water their trees. The vast 
majority, however, die. The survival rate is low. Most of the trees are 
non-native." 
</P>
<P>
 And, as foreign flora, they are not welcome in the region's mountains. "By 
law," said Cahir, "we cannot introduce species into the forest that are not 
native to the area."

 Council members on Tuesday will consider dissolving the Planning Commission, 
along with the city's Environmental Quality Protection Commission, and 
replacing them with a single hearing officer, preferably a planning expert. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the developers have complained that the pipeline gets clogged, and 
their projects are slowed down. . .," City Atty. Gary Gillig said. "The fact of 
the matter is that planning commissioners are not lawyers or experts." 
</P>
<P>
 Planning Commissioner Arthur Joe Lopez said Thursday night that he was shocked 
by the sudden move to get rid of the five-member board. "I'm very surprised," 
said Lopez, after learning of the plan from a reporter. "I have not heard from 
anybody and I had just met with Mayor (Manuel) Lopez and Councilman (Andres) 
Herrera the other day." 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said dissolving the Planning Commission would take away a vital system 
of checks and balances, leaving a handful of people -- namely the City Council 
-- holding the reins of power in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Planning Commission has always served as the public's voice on 
development issues," Lopez said. "We need more public input, not less. No 
administrator can replace a planning commission." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the commission has been more aggressive than the City Council 
in pushing to preserve open space and build affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez said he was also unaware of the proposal until 
Friday. He said that he supports cutting city government, but that dramatic 
changes such as dissolving the Planning Commission should be reviewed with 
caution. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that we need a planning commission," said Lopez, adding that 
the commission has been doing a fine job. "I'm going to look at this real 
closely to see what is being proposed." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, a hearing officer would certify environmental reports and 
process permits like planning commissioners do, and hold public hearings as 
frequently as the Planning Commission has, if not more often, Gillig said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the hearing officer would perform more efficiently, leaving less of an 
opportunity for naysayers to disrupt the development process without good 
cause, said City Planner Matthew Winnegar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having a person who has some training in proper procedures would be more 
expeditious than a committee of five people," Winnegar said. "What we want to 
avoid is people using the planning process merely as an element to delay a 
project." 
</P>
<P>
 Winnegar said he and other city officials suggested doing away with the 
Planning Commission now because there is only one member, Albert Duff, whose 
term is not expiring or who does not have a conflict of interest because he has 
been elected to another office. Arthur Joe Lopez was recently elected to the 
Oxnard School District board. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Oxnard is in the process of changing its zoning ordinance -- the 
first comprehensive revision in almost 50 years. The concept of a hearing 
officer has been discussed for years by city officials as a way to simplify the 
permit process, Winnegar said. 
</P>
<P>
 The zoning revisions will also result in more public hearings. They are 
expected to go before the City Council next spring, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a city report, doing away with the Planning Commission would 
reduce the average processing time for development permits by two to four 
weeks. It would also result in an 80% to 90% decrease in appeals to the City 
Council and reduce the time it takes to process an environmental report by six 
months, the report states. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis J. Malone, president of the regional division of the Baldwin Co., an 
Irvine-based developer that wants to build 5,000 homes at Ormond Beach, said 
dissolving the Planning Commission would help developers move projects through 
the city more smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
 Malone recently complained that the environmental report for the developer's 
435-unit Village West project took much too long to be certified: 15 months.  
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that would speed up the process would be good," Malone said, adding 
that the proposal would probably help the developer's Ormond Beach plans. 
"There are other cities that do that, and it seems to work better." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the municipalities using hearing officers to perform duties 
traditionally done by planning commissions are Burbank, Kern County, and Santee 
in San Diego County, according to a city report. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Tuesday will also consider establishing a community 
development commission, which would take on the duties of the Oxnard 
Redevelopment Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission would pursue redevelopment in accordance with city goals such 
as attracting tourism and boosting the Oxnard economy, said Dena Garcia, the 
city's redevelopment project manager.

NEPTUNE CLAUS; 'HOMETOWN HOLIDAYS' IS THEME FOR GLITTERING FLOTILLA OF YACHTS 
</P>

 Neptune will double as Santa Claus accompanied by his sea-horse reindeer as 40 
brilliant boats float through the Channel Islands Harbor tonight during the 
29th annual Parade of Lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Parade sponsors say the event is expected to draw 30,000 people tonight to see 
the glittering flotilla of yachts, decorated under this year's "Hometown 
Holidays" theme, and thousands earlier for pre-parade festivities that include 
mountains of snow for children to play in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody from the kids to the grandparents enjoys watching it," said parade 
coordinator Susan O'Brien. "It's definitely a unique Southern California 
event." 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures are expected to be in the 60s during the day, dropping to the 50s 
by parade time, with only light winds. 
</P>
<P>
 Another major holiday gathering will take place in downtown Camarillo today, 
where about 5,000 people are expected for the city's 33rd Christmas parade.  
</P>
<P>
 This year's parade, "A Magical Christmas," will feature 20 marching bands from 
Ventura, Los Angeles and San Diego counties, floats, equestrian groups and 
antique cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The procession is scheduled to begin at noon at the corner of Las Posas Road 
and Temple Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Channel Islands Harbor, the competition for most colorful boat is a 
time-consuming but always light-hearted affair. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Pacific Corinthian Yacht Club, members were busy decorating their 
entries Friday with brightly decorated whales, octopuses and mermaids, part of 
their maritime interpretation of the hometown theme. 
</P>
<P>
 On their float, which features Neptune as Santa, Rudolph the sea horse has a 
lobster clinging to his swollen nose. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Bahia Cabrillo Yacht Club, preparations were handled in a decidedly 
laid-back fashion, with decorations for a "Hometown Holidays from New England 
to New Mexico" entry still being assembled Friday. A similar low-budget effort 
won the club first prize last year, and it may work again this year, said 
Roelof Manten, whose boat was used both years. 
</P>
<P>
 "They spent like $5,000 and had people come in to do theirs," said Manten of 
other entries. "We just got drunk one day and put ours together." 
</P>
<P>
 And at the Channel Islands Yacht Club, 73-year-old Bob Ross helped decorate a 
boat with a large wooden sleigh and miniature home Friday, part of a more 
traditional Christmas motif. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of fun doing this," said Ross, who is taking part in his 15th 
parade. "It's a friendly effort."  
</P>
<P>
 The festivities will begin at 9 a.m. today with a dinghy race, in which 
blindfolded row-boaters race toward the finish by following the directions of a 
seeing shipmate. Each participant has to contribute a new toy to take part in 
the event, and the gifts are passed along to poor families. 
</P>
<P>
 Children 8 and under will have a chance to play in 20,000 pounds of snow from 
10 a.m. to 1 p.m. as the Ventura County American Lung Assn. hosts its annual 
Christmas Seal Kickoff next to the Whale's Tail restaurant, which will be 
giving away hot chocolate and cider. 
</P>
<P>
 A weekend art festival featuring painters, sculptors, craftspeople and 
decorators will take place, and horse-drawn sleigh rides with a carol-singing 
Santa and reindeer (played by a human) will be available for $4 per adult and 
$3 per child under 12. And airplanes from Oxnard Airport will fly visitors over 
the festivities and the Channel Islands for $35 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 The actual parade will begin at 7 p.m., when a helicopter will tow a giant 
Santa Claus and reindeer above the harbor.  
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Dunphy, television news anchor for KCAL in Los Angeles, will be the 
parade's grand marshal and will ride in the 52-foot lead boat. 
</P>
<P>
 The entries will circle the harbor twice, and the parade will be visible from 
any part of the harbor. The person who submits the best photo from the event to 
organizers afterward will win a whale-watching trip for four around the Channel 
Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges will award prizes for boats in three categories -- commercial, 
individual and yacht club -- along with an overall sweepstakes winner. The 
"people's choice" award and the winner of a local home decoration contest will 
also be announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsoring the event are Ventura County, the Oxnard Downtowners, the Greater 
Oxnard Harbors and Tourism Bureau, the Channel Islands Harbor, Jones Intercable 
and the Ventura County Edition of The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers are encouraging spectators to park on the harbor's west side, where 
space is more plentiful.

RULING ON EAVESDROP FREES THEFT SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MURPHY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Oxnard burglary suspect walked out of jail free Friday because a prosecutor 
had an investigator eavesdrop on a conversation between the defendant and his 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 In the culmination of a legal battle waged all year, the state Court of Appeal 
ruled Friday that the prosecutor's behavior was so shocking, dismissal of the 
criminal case was the only way to rectify the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sanction is severe but . . . it pales when compared to the conduct which 
compels this court to (act)," 2nd District Justice Kenneth Yegan wrote in a 
17-page opinion. "What has happened here must not happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant, Robert Lee Morrow, 30, had been in custody for more than a 
year, charged with burglarizing a Port Hueneme motel. 
</P>
<P>
 He has sought dismissal of his case since January, when Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Stacy Ratner ordered her investigator to listen to a conversation between 
Morrow and his attorney, so Ratner could find out if the trial was going to 
interfere with a ski trip she had planned. 
</P>
<P>
 The conversation between Morrow and Deputy Public Defender Mary Fielder took 
place in a holding cell adjacent to the courtroom. According to court 
documents, the cell door was ajar and investigator Katherine Smith positioned 
herself in the courtroom so she could hear the conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 The state attorney general charged Ratner and Smith in May with felony 
eavesdropping. The charge later was dropped by a Superior Court judge because 
the pair did not use an electronic device to listen to Morrow's conversation 
with Fielder. 
</P>
<P>
 Yegan, writing for the unanimous three-member court, took particular offense 
to the fact that the eavesdropping took place "within the hallowed confines of 
the courtroom, where the rule of law and fairness should be revered." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our justice system will crumble should those, in whose hands are entrusted 
its preservation and sanctity, betray its fundamental values and principles," 
Yegan wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office issued a written statement in response to the 
court's ruling, and officials refused to comment further. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is regrettable that the underlying incident occurred and that as a result 
this serious residential burglary case cannot now be prosecuted," the statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case is a reminder that prosecutors must adhere to a higher standard of 
conduct than is required of other participants in the criminal justice system," 
the statement continued. "We recognize and accept that reality . . . and do not 
condone conduct which falls below this standard." 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury has consistently fought against the dismissal 
of Morrow's burglary charge, arguing instead that the matter was properly dealt 
with by removing Ratner and Smith from the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratner has since been assigned to the district attorney's child support unit, 
and Smith handles trial preparation investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors also argued in court hearings that the case should not be 
dismissed because there was no evidence that Morrow had been harmed by the 
eavesdropping. 
</P>
<P>
 But the appeals court noted that the reason there was no evidence of harm was 
because Ratner and Smith refused to testify about what happened, choosing 
instead to invoke their right against self-incrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony of that was not lost on Yegan, who wrote that Ratner and Smith 
"obtained refuge under the same constitutional umbrella that should have 
protected (Morrow) from their conduct." 
</P>
<P>
 Public Defender Kenneth I. Clayman said the court's opinion was "a victory for 
all lawyers and clients." 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't think of a more important thing than that an attorney and a client 
can converse in private and not be overheard by the other side," Clayman said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Fielder, whose conversation with Morrow was at the center of the 
controversy, said she was delighted with the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "The opinion is wonderful," she said. "It's very eloquent, and I couldn't 
state it any better myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys said Friday that because Ratner's conduct resulted in the dismissal 
of a criminal case, the incident must be reported to the California State Bar, 
which licenses attorneys and has the power to discipline them. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayman said his office has made no attempt to notify the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Although prosecutors and defense attorneys said Friday they knew of no other 
Ventura County case exactly like this, Yegan chastised prosecutors for ignoring 
earlier warnings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We, ourselves, have warned prosecutors in the past," Yegan wrote. "Yet some 
prosecutors do not seem to be listening."

NUNS PLAN 2 HOUSING PROJECTS FOR POOR, ELDERLY; OXNARD: MERCY CHARITIES HOPES 
TO ALLEVIATE SHORTAGE OF LOW-COST UNITS. IT IS ASKING THE CITY TO DONATE UP TO 
$2 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A consortium of nuns wants to build two housing projects in downtown Oxnard 
across from the current site of Oxnard High School, and they are asking the 
city to share part of the expected $12.4-million cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercy Charities -- a nonprofit developer comprising the Sisters of Mercy, the 
Sisters of St. Josephs of Peace and other religious congregations -- said the 
proposed developments would help alleviate a shortage of low-cost housing in 
Oxnard that is hurting the elderly and poor families. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a big need for the family housing project," said Sister Carmen 
Rodriguez of the Sisters of Mercy convent in Oxnard. "I talk to families all 
the time that are being evicted because they are living in a garage, because 
there are five families living in a house. People are sleeping where the living 
room should be." 
</P>
<P>
 The sisters, who have built or are currently proposing developments in 10 
California counties, are expected to present plans for a 64-unit family housing 
project and a 40-unit development for seniors to the Oxnard City Council on 
Dec. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They will ask the city for a contribution of less than $1 million for each 
project, said Sister Diane Clyne of the San Francisco-based consortium. 
</P>
<P>
 The townhouse developments would be located on a five-acre site at Hobson Way 
and 5th Street across from the First Baptist Church of Oxnard and could be 
completed by 1996, Clyne said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our concept is building a community, not two separate projects," Clyne said. 
"The integration of seniors and family has been very successful in San 
Francisco and other areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez supports the nuns' plan to build low-cost homes and 
said he even wrote a letter to assist their fund-raising efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 But it would be impossible for the city to contribute anywhere near $2 million 
to the project, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that we do need housing for seniors and low-income housing," Lopez 
said. "As far as money is concerned, however, our capability to fund projects 
themselves is very limited. . . . We're up to our ears in requests." 
</P>
<P>
 Mercy Charities submitted an application to the U.S. Department of Housing and 
Urban Development for money to build and operate a federally subsidized housing 
project for the elderly at the site, which was approved in October. 
</P>
<P>
 The nuns were given about $3 million to develop the homes, which must be sold 
to senior citizens whose income is 80% of the county median or less. 
</P>
<P>
 And more HUD money will probably come in later to run and maintain the 
project, Clyne said. The median income for Ventura County in 1990 was $40,400. 
</P>
<P>
 The elderly housing project is expected to cost about $3.8 million, and Mercy 
Charities is in the process of acquiring the land from its current owner, the 
Swift Foundation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks real positive," said Oxnard Housing Director Sal Gonzales. "We are 
pleased that they were able to get funds from HUD." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile the nuns are hoping to finance the family housing project, which is 
expected to cost $8.6 million, with money obtained from state and federal 
low-income housing programs. To garner the financing, the homes would have to 
be sold to families whose income is 60% of the county median or less. 
</P>
<P>
 The land for the development has been donated by Oxnard's St. John's Regional 
Medical Center to Mercy Charities, Clyne said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sisters of Mercy sponsor a statewide health-care ministry that includes 
St. John's and have been a part of the Oxnard community since the turn of the 
century. If the project is approved by the City Council, Sister Carmen 
Rodriguez and other local nuns plan to encourage the city's poor and elderly 
residents to apply.

PILOT HIKES 9 DAYS OVER SIERRA AFTER CRASH; SURVIVAL: LONG BEACH MAN, RAGGED 
AND BRUISED BUT OTHERWISE OK, WALKS INTO A CAFE IN INYO COUNTY. SEARCHERS ARE 
LED BACK TO THE PLANE, WHERE TWO PASSENGERS ARE FOUND DEAD.

<P>
 A Long Beach pilot missing with two companions since the Thanksgiving weekend 
survived a plane crash in the frigid High Sierra and trudged for nine days 
across miles of mountainous terrain before showing up Friday at a cafe in Inyo 
County. His two passengers were later found dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter DeLeo, 33, scratched, weary and wrapped in ragged ski clothes -- showed 
up at the Ranch House Cafe in Olancha, about 200 miles north of Los Angeles, 
almost two weeks after his single-engine plane vanished over the steep, 
high-altitude backcountry of eastern Tulare County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you believe in miracles? Well, you should now," said Lt. Col. Sidney Wolfe 
of the Civil Air Patrol. "They make movies about this stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few hours later, DeLeo boarded a plane and led searchers back to the 
downed plane, which they found in a ravine at the 8,000-foot level near Kern 
Peak in Inyo County, about 20 miles west of the cafe on U.S. 395. His 
companions, Waverly Hatch, 49, and Lloyd Matsumoto, 55, were found in and near 
the wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
 DeLeo was back in Long Beach on Friday night in seclusion with his family. A 
family friend who answered the phone, said, "He's banged up, but he's all 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked him how he survived," said Bill Woodward, manager of the Lone Pine 
Airport. "He said 'sheer determination.' 
</P>
<P>
 "He stayed on the sunny side of the mountains" during the day, Woodward said, 
adding that DeLeo traveled above the tree line in hopes that searchers would 
see him. "He kept bundled up in the brush at night . . . (and) he ate snow," 
Woodward said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We figure he walked 35 to 40 miles, given the terrain," said Cpl. Scott Stell 
of the Inyo County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Thursday, after cresting the snow-covered spine of the Sierra at an 
altitude of 9,000 feet or higher, DeLeo spotted lights on U.S. 395 from a ridge 
and stumbled his way down in the dark. DeLeo made his way to the highway, where 
he flagged down a motorist. "He was . . . waving and screaming, and said he was 
in a plane crash and hadn't eaten anything for days," said Jennifer Homan, 
manager of the Ranch House Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot arrived at the cafe in a tattered ski jacket and snow boots. Despite 
cuts on his hands and face and an arm too sore to move, DeLeo refused medical 
treatment, witnesses said. He thought his friends had already been rescued, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was under the impression that we had already found these people because he 
had seen aircraft flying in the area," said an Inyo County sheriff's spokesman. 
"But they never noticed (the wreckage) because of the area." 
</P>
<P>
 DeLeo told authorities that he had stayed with his companions for a few days, 
and they were alive when he began his journey. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the passengers had walked away from the airplane a short distance and 
expired. The other passenger had expired in the aircraft," Wolfe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before heading back to locate the wreckage, DeLeo called home and left a 
message on a recording machine, said his brother, Rocco DeLeo of New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not surprised that he made it out," Rocco DeLeo said, adding that he had 
been teaching his brother to rock- and ice-climb. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brother is a survivalist. He thrives on it," Rocco DeLeo said. 
</P>
<P>
 A sheriff's spokesman said DeLeo believed that his plane had fallen victim to 
wind shear, a sudden, dramatic change in the direction and speed in which air 
is moving. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Transportation and Safety Board is investigating the crash of the 
single-engine, four-seat Maule M-5. 
</P>
<P>
 DeLeo is an entrepreneur. Hatch was a pilot and a certified aviation mechanic, 
and Matsumoto was a counselor. The three reportedly took the plane trip to 
photograph the Sierra. They had taken the same trip a week earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The last contact with DeLeo had been a radio transmission received at Kern 
Valley Airport about four hours after DeLeo left Long Beach Municipal Airport 
on Nov. 27.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CANOGA PARK; VIDEO 
DISTRIBUTOR ORDERED TO GIVE $10,000 TO SHELTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A video distribution company was ordered Friday to contribute $10,000 to a 
shelter for runaways and former prostitutes and banned from disseminating 
obscene materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Municipal Court Commissioner Barry Kohn imposed the sentence on 
Fantastic Pictures Inc. after its attorneys entered a no-contest plea to a 
criminal charge growing out of the firm's direct-mail videocassette business. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohn also placed the company on two years summary probation and banned it from 
disseminating materials depicting a wide range of sex acts, including rape, 
bestiality, sex with minors, sexual torture and murder for sexual 
gratification. All are illegal under state obscenity laws.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; ONE-STOP CENTER TO OPEN FOR HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE RYFLE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A coalition of Glendale charities and city officials has expanded its efforts 
to aid the city's homeless by opening a new "one-stop center" for the needy and 
reopening the city's only homeless shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 The new center, at the Salvation Army's Glendale headquarters, offers health 
screening, job information and help with welfare and Social Security issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it opened last month, the center has assisted about 30 needy singles and 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Glendale Cold Weather Shelter, which provided meals and beds 
for several hundred homeless people last winter for the first time, will reopen 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cold weather program was very successful last year," said the Rev. Greg 
Roth of Glendale Presbyterian Church, a member of the Glendale Task Force on 
Homelessness. "The volunteers who helped feed the homeless and staffed the 
shelter overnight were so surprised by the diversity of homeless people that 
came. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most common comment was, 'These folks could be my own children.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The task force was formed by local leaders in 1992 to begin tackling the 
problems of a homeless population estimated to number 260 to 360 people on any 
given night. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force studied the services available to the homeless from local 
charities and sought to fill the gaps, with a view to helping the homeless 
become self-sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 Its formation followed the release of "The State of the Streets," a 1992 
report by local charities that broke down Glendale's homeless into categories: 
50% were "temporary homeless" who sleep in motel rooms or friends' homes, 30% 
were "chronic homeless" (including drug and alcohol addicts, the mentally ill 
and veterans), 10% were frail elderly and another 10% were found to be 
non-Glendale or transitory homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force's first proposal was to open the winter shelter; this past May, 
it proposed establishment of the one-stop center. 
</P>
<P>
 Future projects may include new temporary and transitional housing and a 
homeless outreach program. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth, who has worked with the city's homeless for more than a decade -- even 
presiding over the funerals of 15 homeless people -- said he is glad that the 
problem he has been working on for so long is finally receiving serious 
attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've come a long, long way," Roth said. STEVE RYFLE

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SANTA ANA; HEARING BEGINS FOR UNCLE CHARGED IN ABUSE OF 
BOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman charged with torturing and sexually abusing her 10-year-old nephew 
once slapped her own son so hard she knocked out one of his teeth, and would 
use makeup on the boys to cover their bruises, according to testimony during a 
court hearing Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Medina, 31, of Orange is charged with three counts of felony child 
abuse and one count of torture. The torture charge is unprecedented in Orange 
County criminal history. 
</P>
<P>
 Medina's husband, Edward, 45, also is charged with three counts of felony 
child abuse for allegedly doing nothing to aid the children during the abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's testimony from two Orange police investigators came during the start 
of a preliminary hearing for Edward Medina in Orange County Central Municipal 
Court. The hearing is expected to conclude Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The testimony included graphic details about the attack on the nephew. Cynthia 
Medina allegedly punished the boy for touching an ashtray by beating him and 
anally penetrating him with a small baseball bat. The boy's injuries were so 
severe he had to be fitted temporarily with a colostomy bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Medina allegedly walked into the room when Cynthia Medina was abusing 
the boy and demanded, "What the hell are you doing?" but later left the room, 
according to testimony from Orange Detective Patrick Thayer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Medinas were caring for the boy because his own mother could no longer do 
so. The nephew has since been placed in foster care. The couple's son is living 
with his grandparents. 
</P>
<P>
 Thayer also testified that information he gathered from interviews with the 
abused nephew and Edward Medina indicated the latter did nothing to help the 
boys and once even held the child's arms as he struggled to evade his aunt's 
blows. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Medina told authorities that his wife handled the discipline in the 
house, Thayer said. Once, when he tried to stop her from hitting the nephew, 
she warned him: "Back off," Thayer testified.RENE LYNCH

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; TRAFFIC RESTRICTED IN HOLIDAY DISPLAY 
AREA 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This holiday season should be merrier for residents in the neighborhood of the 
annual Christmas display. 
</P>
<P>
 A preferential parking system will be put into place for residents this year 
for the annual event that attracts thousands to view the area's 
holiday-decorated homes.The display will run through Dec. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 The display is presented by residents of Shadbush Street and Camrose, Dahlia 
and Dandelion circles, off Brookhurst Street and Heil Avenue. The neighborhood 
is across from the Fountain Valley Recreation and Cultural Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council this week approved a permit process, which will restrict 
traffic to all but neighborhood residents and their guests from 6:30 to 9 p.m. 
Visitors may park for free at the recreation center, 16400 Brookhurst St., and 
walk through the display area. 
</P>
<P>
 In past years, increased traffic was a concern to local residents, police 
said. City officials said they received some complaints last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional traffic was also a concern for the police and fire departments 
because of a greater risk of accidents and access for emergency vehicles. The 
permit process is a way of controlling the area's parking and traffic flow, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will post signs and place barricades. Police Explorers will help 
patrol the area and place traffic control equipment. DEBRA CANO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SANTA ANA; MAN SENTENCED FOR LEADING FATAL CHASE

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 22-year-old Orange man who was fleeing from police when he caused a traffic 
accident that left two dead was sentenced Friday to 15 years to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Alden Whitson apologized for his actions on that day, before Orange 
County Superior Court Judge Richard L. Weatherspoon handed down one prison term 
of 15 years to life for each victim.The terms will be served concurrently. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitson and a friend, who had just stolen a car stereo, were trying to flee 
police late June 11, 1993, when Whitson crashed into another car in Fountain 
Valley. Killed were Derick Romo, 26, of Moreno Valley, a passenger in Whitson's 
car, and Janice Diehm, 46, of Fountain Valley, who was driving the car they 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Diehm, a marriage and family counselor, had been out to dinner with her 
husband that night and was driving home their son's caretaker when the crash 
occurred.  
</P>
<P>
 When she did not immediately return home, Diehm's husband went looking for her 
and came across the crash scene, according to trial testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors decided to seek the harshest penalty against Whitson because he 
was speeding up to 80 m.p.h. with his headlights off and ran several red lights 
before the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury convicted Whitson in October of two counts of second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Gary Pohlson could not be reached for comment late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Pohlson had argued at trial that Whitson should only be convicted of the 
lesser charge of manslaughter, and on Friday asked a judge to reduce the murder 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 He argued that Whitson is "functionally retarded" and was urged by his 
passengers to speed from police.RENE LYNCH

 A nature walk and a meteor shower will be the highlights during the next two 
weeks at the Rancho Mission Viejo Land Conservancy.

<P>
 Ventura shoppers may soon be able to buy cappuccino, flowers and hot dogs on 
street corners, thanks to a proposed ordinance approved by a City Council 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's Economic Committee has recommended that the proposal allowing 
outdoor vendors be forwarded to the city Planning Commission.The commission 
will pass its recommendation on to the City Council for a final vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance would allow a vendor who purchases a $50 permit at City Hall to 
sell nonalcoholic beverages, food or produce outdoors in a commercial, 
industrial or park area. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue arose when a coffee vendor wanted to open a stall outside the 
Buenaventura Mall, but found that the city code had no provisions for outdoor 
carts, Councilwoman Rosa Lee Measures said. CONSTANCE SOMMER

 Community groups and the city today invites a neighborhood once riddled with 
crime to decorate a donated Christmas tree in Flower Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The county-funded Project SABADO and Carver Concerned Parents -- formed 
earlier this year to walk children to school safely -- is hosting the event, 
said Judy Buffin-Edge, a SABADO board member. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fire Department will deliver the tree, donated by Home Depot, to the park 
on an engine at 10 a.m. Children will decorate it with donated garland and 
ornaments made Carver Elementary School students, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tree will be planted to symbolize new hope in the neighborhood, which has 
been relatively calm since an undercover police operation made many 
gang-related arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be just a symbol of peace in that park," Buffin-Edge said. 
</P>

 Project SABADO is seeking donations of ornaments, she said. LEE ROMNEY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: MISSION VIEJO; CITY BUDGET IS SAFE FOR NOW, OFFICIAL 
TELLS COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City finance officials assured a worried City Council this week that the 
fiscal crisis sparked by the county declaring bankruptcy won't mean disaster 
for the city budget. 
</P>
<P>
 At a special meeting Thursday, Finance Director Irwin Bornstein told council 
members that the city budget would remain balanced through the end of the 
fiscal year in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news is that the bankruptcy debacle means the city's principal in the 
pool and interest earned on its investment have been frozen. The city's stake 
is $18.7 million and about $300,000 in interest earnings, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the courts are able to look at the bankruptcy filing: "No one can say 
how much (of the city investment) we'll get back, no one knows when," Bornstein 
said. "We are not going to get 100% back." 
</P>
<P>
 The county's damaged credit rating will also affect Mission Viejo's ability to 
sell bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had to access (the bond market) today, we'd experience higher interest 
rates," Bornstein said. "But that's today. Presumably, the market will 
improve." 
</P>
<P>
 Although a majority of council members praised Bornstein for the thoroughness 
of his report, Councilman William Craycraft pointed out that city policy 
specifically prohibits high-risk investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding up a city policy manual, Craycraft wondered why the city allowed the 
county pool to make high-risk investments on its behalf when the practice is 
prohibited by municipal policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Bornstein said the policy applied to investments made directly by the city, 
not pool activity, because "as contract city, we lacked the (investment) skill. 
. . . We assumed the county had experienced personnel to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bornstein briefly criticized the county for not fully informing the city of 
how much was invested in risk-laden securities. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, we were not given the type of information to reflect 
the risk they were taking," Bornstein said. FRANK MESSINA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; TRUSTEES VOTE TO CHIP IN DARE FUNDS

 The school board unanimously approved paying for a middle school Drug Abuse 
Resistance Education (DARE) program this week, after two city councilmen, a 
student, a parent and three police officers testified in favor of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-hour program will begin this school year in eighth-grade physical 
education classes.It also will include a new segment on gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Unified School District board balked last month at the $90,000 cost 
of the program that would be split by the city and the school district. 
Questions also were raised about recent reports challenging the DARE program's 
effectiveness in preventing drug abuse among students. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Police Lt. Sam Allevato, supervisor of the department's DARE unit, told 
school board members that the research cited by critics of the DARE program was 
incomplete and was not accepted by the National Institute of Justice, which 
funded the 1993 study. He said 90% of the students surveyed in a recent Gallup 
poll said the DARE program helped them avoid drug abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved funding for half the cost of the program on June 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Mayor Michael Ward and Councilman Greg Smith spoke in favor of the 
program Tuesday night. The city currently funds two DARE officers who conduct a 
17-week course for sixth-graders and give presentations to lower grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said it is critical to reinforce DARE training for middle school 
students.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is a community problem," Smith said. "This is not just a school district 
problem." RUSS LOAR

<P>
 The First United Methodist Church of Canoga Park is accepting applications for 
a $1,500 scholarship awarded yearly to at least one college junior or senior. 
</P>
<P>
 The scholarship fund was created by the church in memory of Laura Longman, who 
died in 1984 of a heart attack while a student at San Francisco State 
University. 
</P>
<P>
 Longman was ill with heart disease throughout her academic career and had to 
have an experimental heart transplant.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; $1 MILLION 
AWARDED HEIRS OF TWO OF THE THREE STOOGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jurors in a financial dispute between the heirs of the Three Stooges awarded 
$1 million in punitive damages Friday to the relatives of Joe (Curly Joe) 
DeRita and Larry Fine. 
</P>
<P>
 The damages were awarded by the Los Angeles Superior Court jury a week after 
relatives of DeRita and Fine won more than $2 million in general damages from 
the heirs of Moe Howard. The plaintiffs sued Howard's grandson, Jeffrey Scott, 
and daughter, Joan Maurer, in 1993, alleging that the defendants were 
shortchanging them on royalties checks from Three Stooges merchandise. The 
verdicts followed three months of testimony and more than two weeks of jury 
deliberations.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; VINTAGE PLANE RECALLS GERMAN BOMBER DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BORIS YARO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dean Collinson, whose family hailed from Portsmouth, England, gazed at the 
sleek twin-engined plane with the Nazi markings parked on Mercury Aviation's 
ramp at Burbank Airport and said: "I've never seen something that's bombed 
England." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, he still hasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Collinson was talking about the Heinkel 111 decked out in dark green, brown 
and black camouflage paint, sporting large black crosses on its fuselage and a 
swastika on its tail. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of bombers of this type flew day and night against England in the 
Battle of Britain in 1940 until Royal Air Force pilots of Hurricanes and 
Spitfire fighters discovered they could easily shoot them down. 
</P>
<P>
 This particular plane, however, was not built in Germany, but by a Spanish 
aircraft firm called CASA, which had acquired the rights from Heinkel to build 
it in 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 It never flew in a World War II battle but was used as the personal plane of 
Spain's Generalissimo Francisco Franco. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1960s it was used in filming the movie "Battle of Britain," and in 
the 1970s was acquired by the Confederate Air Force, a loose-knit group of 
Texas-based aviation buffs who restore and fly historical military aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilot Larry Perkins, who has been taking the plane "on kind of a tour of 
Southern California for the CAF," calls it "the only flyable model of this 
bomber in the world right now." 
</P>
<P>
 To circumvent the ban on military aircraft manufacturing imposed on Germany 
after World War I, the Heinkel was designed originally so that it could be used 
as a passenger plane, but included features that allowed it to be easily 
converted to a bomber. Lufthansa, the German airlines, had nine such HE-111s in 
service when World War II began in 1939 and many more were built openly as 
military planes. 
</P>
<P>
 Gazing at the plane, Dick Reinke, 74, of Glendora recalled his own war 
experiences as a U. S. Air Force reconnaissance pilot doing low-level photo 
runs of the beaches around Normandy prior to D-Day.  
</P>
<P>
 He visited the plane at Burbank Airport one day recently to take pictures of 
the plane "from a historical point of view and to add to my collection". 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Collinson's friends, British-born Tim Scannell and German-born Rainer 
Giermansinski, were also on the scene and tried to put the plane's history in 
perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 Giermansinski said he was born two years after the war ended and his family 
came from an area of Germany that saw little fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 To him, he said, the plane is "an interesting piece of history, but, it is 
difficult to relate to." 
</P>
<P>
 Scannell, whose family lived near London during World War II, also had never 
seen a German bomber. "My dad was bombed out of his house three times during 
the war," he said. Nonetheless, he added that he is "really pleased these guys 
keep it flying." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Perkins: "We are promoting history so we don't have to relive it." BORIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA CRUZ ISLAND; 120 FIREFIGHTERS TRY TO CONTROL 
GRASSLAND BLAZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 120 firefighters converged on Santa Cruz Island on Friday where a 
fire burned for its fourth day, consuming 650 acres of overgrown grassland and 
charring the island's hilly terrain, National Park Service officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said they expected to contain the blaze early today. 
</P>
<P>
 A controlled burn set on 400 acres Tuesday rekindled early Thursday after high 
winds swept across the northeastern portion of the island. Embers carried by 
the wind then sparked new fires, which burned more than 250 acres outside of 
the initial control lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to contain the blaze were hampered Friday by logistics problems and by 
15- to 20-foot-tall brush and debris in hard-to-reach canyons, said Valdo 
Calvert, U.S. Forest Service operations chief. 
</P>
<P>
 "The heavy fuel has presented a very dangerous situation for us," Calvert 
said. "This growth has been collecting in pockets of these canyons for 
decades." 
</P>
<P>
 With 12 hand crews hiking through steep, overgrown terrain as they cut a path 
around the fire, Calvert said, safety has been the major concern. 
</P>
<P>
 The only mishap occurred Thursday night when one firefighter developed 
hypothermia after water from a ruptured hose drenched him. Exposed to chilling 
winds, the California Forest Service firefighter was treated on the island and 
returned to fight the blaze Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 No structures or endangered wildlife have been threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 Calvert said chief among his priorities has been to avoid damaging sensitive 
plant and animal species, as well as any important archeological resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Channel Islands National Park archeologist Don Morris flew to the island 
Friday to help guide fire crews around areas that might contain significant 
Chumash artifacts, such as baskets, bowls and hand tools. MATTHEW MOSK

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: AGENCY FAULTED FOR FEW MINORITY BOSSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The county's Affirmative Action Commission criticized the Corrections Services 
Agency for having no minority managers and few minority supervising probation 
officers in a report released this week. 
</P>
<P>
 There is good minority representation among the lower ranks of probation 
officers in the agency, the commission said in a report that will be presented 
to the Board of Supervisors on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But that representation falls sharply among supervisors and managers. Maria 
Carmen Flores is the only minority employee who supervises probation officers, 
and there are no minorities in the managing ranks, according to the report. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's findings are not surprising, said Calvin Remington, deputy 
director of the corrections agency. Several minorities have been hired as 
probation officers in recent years, but they don't have the experience or 
seniority yet to advance to upper management, Remington said. 
</P>
<P>
 Turnover in the agency is very low, so the opportunities for promotions have 
been minimal, he said. In the next two years, several upper-level managers are 
expected to retire, opening spaces for minority recruits, Remington said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Diaz, the county's affirmative action officer, also noted that several 
recent hires in the agency have been minorities. "It's going to take a little 
bit of time for them to reach upper management, but I think the corrections 
agency is headed in the right direction," she said. KAY SAILLANT

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FOOTHILL RANCH; HUGE INFLATABLE SANTA VANISHES FROM ROOF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A real-life Grinch stole a 30-foot inflatable Santa Claus from a shopping 
center using it to promote a sale, a spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to believe anyone would steal a Santa Claus," said Ralph Rodheim, 
marketing director for the Foothill Ranch Marketplace."Maybe it's a high-school 
prank." 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants put up the blow-up St. Nick, valued at $12,500, about a week ago and 
sent out thousands of mailers inviting local residents this weekend to see the 
giant Santa and a companion Frosty the Snowman balloon, Rodheim said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thought was to do something for the holidays bigger than life," Rodheim 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Wednesday morning, Santa was gone. Shopkeepers first assumed it had 
been taken down to protect it against high winds. But a check revealed that 
someone had made off with the rooftop Santa, which had been anchored by 
200-pound sandbags, ropes and attached to powerful lights and a blower to keep 
it inflated. 
</P>
<P>
 "They took the sandbags out. They took the lights out. The lines were still 
there," Rodheim said. 
</P>
<P>
 A sheriff's supervisor said Friday evening he had no details on the alleged 
theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodheim appealed for the public's help in finding Santa. And he said merchants 
would take down Frosty today to prevent a similar heist. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks a little lonely," he said.KEN ELLINGWOOD

<P>
 Gurgen Odjakhian, 32, arrived home from work at 5:30 p.m. Thursday and was 
shot in front of the home he shared with his wife and three children in the 400 
block of Hawthorne Street, said Lt. Don Meredith of the Glendale Police 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife heard the gunfire, ran outside and found him, then called 911, said 
police spokesman Chahe Keuroghelian. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was slumped down in front" of the house, Meredith said. "It appeared to be 
a single gunshot wound." 
</P>

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; SHELL WESTERN SETTLES OIL SPILLS LAWSUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL ELIAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shell Western E&P Inc. "reluctantly agreed" to settle a civil lawsuit filed by 
the Ventura County district attorney over a series of oil spills, company 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Without admitting wrongdoing, Shell officials agreed to pay $95,000 in fines 
and penalties for four spills at its Ventura Avenue oil field since May 5, 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reluctance has to do with the terms of the settlement," Shell spokeswoman 
Susan Hersberger said. "We were very disappointed the authorities apparently 
did not take into account the minor extent and nature of the spills nor the 
company's immediate action and thorough response." 
</P>
<P>
 Hersberger said the spills left "no lasting impact on the environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher S. Harman agreed that little permanent 
environmental damage occurred, but said the spills still violated state law. 
</P>
<P>
 "We consider these spills serious because a number of them occurred over a 
short period of time," he said. "When oil actually gets in the water, that's a 
serious matter." 
</P>
<P>
 The largest of the four spills occurred when a tank overflowed Jan. 25 and 473 
barrels of oil and water escaped, some of it reaching a dry creek that led to 
the Ventura River. The most recent occurred Aug. 10 when a pipeline burst and 
21 barrels of oil and water poured into Diablo Canyon Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shell responded promptly and fully cleaned up each spill," Harman said. But 
he said the district attorney insisted on filing the lawsuit "to let (Shell) 
know this is unacceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Fish and Wildlife Propagation Fund and the California 
Department of Fish and Game's Preservation Fund will split $80,000 of the 
fines. Shell officials also agreed to pay the district attorney $7,000 for 
investigation costs and $8,000 to the California District Attorneys Assn. for 
use in its environmental enforcement program. 
</P>
<P>
 Hersberger said Shell agreed to settle to "avoid costly and uncertain 
litigation." PAUL ELIAS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: FILLMORE; STATE REVOKES LICENSE OF USED-CAR DEALER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State investigators have revoked the license of a used-car dealer in Fillmore 
who is accused of stealing $6,600 from a financing company and failing to repay 
a $42,700 bank loan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Motor Vehicles in September charged Michael Wayne Harter of 
Oxnard with grand theft and fraud in connection with his used-car business, 
Michael "J" Auto Sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervising investigator Steve Wimpress said Harter went out of business in 
late September and has since left the state. While operating his business, 
Harter lived in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Wimpress said Harter does not face criminal prosecution because the charges 
were filed administratively against Harter's license to sell cars in 
California. Under state law, dealers may challenge charges against their 
license and request a hearing before an administrative law judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Harter, however, has never responded to the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Wimpress, the charges against Harter stem from two actions: 
failure to repay a loan from First National Bank of Ventura and his collection 
of payment for the same car twice. In the latter incident, Harter collected 
payment directly from the customer and from Auto Dealer's Acceptance Corp., a 
separate financing company, Wimpress said. JULIE FIELDS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Con artists have been posing as utility workers to burglarize homes, the Los 
Angeles Department of Water and Power warned Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The impostors, who have been working in pairs and targeting mostly elderly 
residents, identify themselves as employees of the DWP or another utility, said 
James Derry, the DWP's customer service director.  
</P>
<P>
 They find a reason to draw the person outside to the meter while one of them 
remains inside to steal money or property, Derry said. DWP field employees 
carry photo identification cards and are generally in uniform.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: GALLEGLY CRITICIZES CLINTON BOSNIA OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Elton Gallegly spoke out Friday against President Clinton's offer to send 
thousands of U.S. ground troops to Bosnia-Herzegovina to help evacuate the U.N. 
peacekeeping force there. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Republican, who sits on the House Foreign Affairs Committee, 
said Clinton has shown a troubling willingness to dispatch U.S. troops to hot 
spots around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crisis in Bosnia is something that none of us can accept," Gallegly said 
in a statement. "But this conflict simply does not meet the threshold that must 
be met before we put American lives in harm's way." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly also called for an end to the arms embargo against the Bosnian 
Muslims and said any American intervention there should occur by air. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're looking to provide that kind of support, we should do so by air -- 
not by putting young Americans in a very hostile and volatile situation and 
entrusting their safety to foreign commanders," he said. MARC LACEY

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; AGGRESSIVE BOBBY SHERMAN FAN FREED

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 39-year-old woman was released from jail in Van Nuys on Friday afternoon 
after authorities warned her not to go near former teen idol Bobby Sherman. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethel Richards, 39, had called Sherman, his office and his mother.She was 
arrested outside his Encino home. 
</P>
<P>
 If Richards doesn't leave Sherman alone, LAPD Detective Jeff Dunn said, "we're 
going to re-evaluate our decision not to press charges." 
</P>
<P>
 "I certainly have no ill feelings towards her," said Sherman in an interview 
Friday. "I had no recourse, I really didn't. . . . I don't do that to fans. 
Most of my fans, if they find my address, they'll ask for an autograph." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman said Richards had called every Sherman listed in the telephone book 
until she found his mother, and also called his offices and manager posing as a 
record-company executive.  
</P>
<P>
 Sherman said police had advised him to notify them if she showed up at his 
home. Police arrested Richards about 5:15 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn said the decision not to charge Richards was made in a conference Friday 
attended by Sherman, detectives and the city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Richards spent Wednesday and Thursday nights in the Van Nuys jail. Sherman 
said she had written him a number of letters last month stating that when she 
was a teen-age runaway. Sherman lent her money to call home. NICHOLAS RICCARDI

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; LOSING COUNCIL CANDIDATE FACES 
COMPLAINT PARTY WAS TOO LOUD

 City Planning Commissioner Susie Newman, a recent council candidate, has been 
slapped with a misdemeanor complaint that she violated conditions of a 
temporary entertainment permit to play live music at her downtown restaurant on 
election night. 
</P>
<P>
 Police charge that music played on the night of Nov. 8 was so loud that it 
could be heard outside Newman's restaurant. Police also charge that the 
establishment's owners allowed dancing inside the Italian restaurant, called 
Mazzotti's, at 412 Walnut Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is she violated the temporary live entertainment permit," 
said Police Chief Ronald E. Lowenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowenberg said one of the conditions of the permit is that noise would not 
disturb surrounding businesses and residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We determined based on complaints that in fact you could hear the noise and 
that it was loud and audible beyond the property of Mazzotti's," Lowenberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the Orange County district attorney's office is handling the case 
because of Newman's role as a public official. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman, who held her election night party at her restaurant, said she received 
notice of the complaint -- a misdemeanor violation -- in her home mail on 
Friday. The complaint summons her to appear Jan. 4 in West Court in Westminster 
to enter a plea. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman, co-owner of the restaurant with Leonard Mazzotti, said that the 
charges are petty and that they also jeopardize the restaurant's license to 
sell liquor. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman, who came in fifth out of 22 candidates vying for four open seats on 
the council, said that the charge "no question is harassment." 
</P>
<P>
 Lowenberg said Newman's charge of harassment is "ludicrous." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have better things to do than harass," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman said police arrived at the restaurant Nov. 7 because of noise 
complaints, and as a result the band stopped playing about 10:30 p.m. The next 
night, she said, the music ended by 10:15 p.m. Of the dancing, Newman said her 
supporters were merely reacting to incoming election results on her status in 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're picking on me, and I just ran for public office. I have knowledge how 
the system works -- imagine how the other people who have less knowledge of the 
system feel about getting a fair shake."DEBRA CANO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; GOLDEN WEST STUDENTS PROTEST EXPULSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 About 20 college students and community activists on Friday protested the 
expulsion of three Golden West College students who were arrested two months 
ago for staging a sit-in at the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstrators gathered outside Coast Community College District 
headquarters 
</P>
<P>
 "We were kicked out of class and now we are being denied an education," said 
Lupe Lopez, 21, who spent two days in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, Ana Carbajal, 28, and Claudia Rochin, 20, were expelled two months ago, 
prohibited from completing classes and banned from attending district campus 
for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said the women violated student conduct codes and the 
punishment was just. 
</P>
<P>
 Demonstrators disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sept. 1 sit-in was staged to demand that Golden West College reinstate 
MEChA (Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan), a Chicano student 
organization. Administrators dropped recognition when the group sponsored a 
scholarship fund-raiser in the spring at which alcohol was reportedly consumed. 
Another factor was the student group's refusal to select a new adviser, 
administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Evidence was overwhelming that alcohol was present," said Dave Bender, the 
district's attorney. Students said the club did not serve alcohol but that one 
attendant, not a MEChA member, did have alcohol present and was ordered to dump 
his drink. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice Chancellor Gene Farrell told Lopez: "America is going to provide you the 
opportunity for your day in court." 
</P>
<P>
 Carbajal said she and the other women have a lawyer working on an appeal of 
their expulsions. 
</P>
<P>
 The students plan to attend Wednesday's district Board of Trustees meeting to 
continue their protest. Trustees have the power to reverse the expulsions and 
can reinstate MEChA if they want to, Farrell said. MIMI KO

 In December, 1932, the Huntington Beach City Council received a petition 
signed by a number of angry residents who lived in the area of Yorktown and 
Hampshire avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 The residents objected to the odor coming from a garlic grinding plant and 
unsanitary conditions existing in and around the pepper drying plants. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Huntington Beach was a small farm town. 
</P>
<P>
 The account is part of a historical journal of past City Council meetings 
compiled by current City Clerk Connie Brockway. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same 1932 meeting, the council appropriated $100 for the Christmas Fund 
sponsored by the city's volunteer Fire Department. Today 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a gift for that special canine in your life. 
</P>
<P>
 The folks at Seal Beach Animal Control are inviting all dogs and their owners 
to take part in a rabies vaccination clinic from 1:30 to 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The vaccinations will be offered at the Seal Beach Animal Care Center, at 1700 
Adolfo Lopez Drive, which is just off Seal Beach Boulevard and near the Seal 
Beach police station.

<P>
 Vaccinations will cost $4 and are for dogs only.

 For information, call (310) 431-2527.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; U.S., 2 PORTS WEIGH WETLANDS 
RESTORATION

<P>
 Department of Interior representatives have been meeting with officials from 
the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles to seek an agreement allowing port 
money to help restore the Bolsa Chica wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement being discussed, the ports would provide an unspecified 
sum so the state could buy and restore up to 900 acres of the 1,100-acre 
wetland area off Pacific Coast Highway.In exchange, the ports would be allowed 
to expand by filling in portions of the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have worked with these two ports for a long time in helping them define 
mitigation opportunities," said Jack Fancher, an assistant field supervisor for 
the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service who has attended some of the meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the potential agreement, the Koll Real Estate Group -- which owns the 
Bolsa Chica land and has proposed building 3,300 homes on it -- would go ahead 
with the construction of about 2,500 homes on the Bolsa Chica mesa but would 
drop an additional 900 homes proposed for the adjacent lowland area. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's existing plan is expected to be considered by the county Board 
of Supervisors next week.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've been meeting," said Ralph Appy, assistant director of environmental 
management for the Port of Los Angeles, "but we have nothing concrete in front 
of us at all. We've just met and talked generalities." 
</P>
<P>
 Notably absent from the talks has been a representative of Koll. "I don't know 
what to think," Lucy Dunn, the company's senior vice president, said Friday. 
"There have been no offers. Nothing is on the table. We will evaluate any 
offer, but there is no guarantee that an offer could result in a purchase."

<P>
 About 200 Southern California middle and high school students are gathering in 
Anaheim this weekend for the "Partners for the Planet" regional youth summit. 
</P>
<P>
 The event is held by young people to inspire and educate their peers about how 
they can help the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to encourage (the participants to see) that youth can be 
leaders and can be on the forefront of the environmental movement," said 
16-year-old Tammy Smith, one of the summit organizers. "We do have hope, and we 
have to take control of our future." 
</P>
<P>
 The summit began Friday and continues through Sunday at the Anaheim Grand 
Hotel. Activities planned for today include interactive workshops, ecological 
exhibits, entertainment, speeches, award presentations and a vegetarian dinner 
banquet. 
</P>
<P>
 Workshops and a closing session are scheduled for Sunday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the groups presenting the event is the Tree Musketeers, a nonprofit 
Southern California environmental organization founded in 1987. The group held 
a "Partners for the Planet" national youth summit last year in Ohio. Another 
national event is planned for next year in Utah, and an international summit is 
scheduled for 1996 in China. 
</P>
<P>
 "These summits are just as much about youth empowerment and moving kids to 
action as they are specific to the environment," said Kathy Darling, manager of 
development for Tree Musketeers. "We want them to feel like they can make a 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 The regional summit in Anaheim is designed for students age 10 to 18. The 
registration fee is $25, which includes meals. Scholarships are available on a 
financial need basis. 
</P>

COUNCIL CALLS STUDY OF CONTRACTS INADEQUATE; HIRING: LAWMAKERS REJECT REPORT 
THAT WAS 3 1/2 YEARS IN THE MAKING. THE MOVE FURTHER CLOUDS FUTURE OF 
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION EFFORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 3 1/2-year study intended to help the city of Los Angeles increase its 
hiring of firms owned by women and minorities was rejected by the City Council 
on Friday as "incomplete and inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
 The rejection of the report casts a further shadow over the city's affirmative 
action efforts, already clouded last year when a state appellate court threw 
out a city program that required contractors to enlist women and minorities in 
their endeavors. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials must now wait about three months for a state Supreme Court 
decision that they hope will revive the outreach program and pump life back 
into affirmative action efforts initiated by former Mayor Tom Bradley. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's unanimous council vote ended a long and troubled contract with 
Cordoba Corp., which was paid $340,000 for a report on the city's history of 
contracting with firms not headed by white men. 
</P>
<P>
 Cordoba's contract was extended and antagonism toward the firm grew when press 
reports said that it would recommend increased contracting with Latino firms 
while suggesting that African American firms already had a fair share of the 
city's business. 
</P>
<P>
 Cordoba representatives said the press reports misconstrued their findings. 
They blamed the city's poor record-keeping for their difficulty in completing 
the study. 
</P>
<P>
 In the information compiled, the firm found "widespread discrimination in the 
city's procurement processes," according to Cordoba lawyer Tony Zamora. But he 
said the background data was insufficient to stand up in a court challenge to 
any affirmative action contracting program. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the council conceded that "available city data are insufficient to 
serve as a basis for reliable statistical analysis," adding that the report was 
inadequate "in a number of respects." 
</P>
<P>
 Cordoba will get to keep its $340,000 and both sides have agreed not to sue 
the other over the failed study. The city also resolved to improve 
record-keeping, in hopes that a statistical analysis of contracting can one day 
be completed. 
</P>
<P>
 Cordoba has previously had lucrative contracts with the Los Angeles Unified 
School District and the Southern California Rapid Transit District and has been 
part of a partnership that demolished buildings after the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 The end of the study came just three days after the city asked the state 
Supreme Court to preserve its Minority and Women's Business Enterprise Program, 
which required all contractors to show a good-faith effort to include 
minorities and women. 
</P>
<P>
 An appellate court in 1993 threw out the 10-year-old program, saying that the 
City Charter requires contracts to go to the lowest responsible bidder and that 
other requirements can only be added through voter-approved charter amendments. 
The city's program had been initiated by Mayor Bradley's executive order. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the lower-court ruling, the city's contracting procedures have been in 
limbo and the involvement of companies headed by women and minorities has 
decreased, said Charles Dickerson, a senior assistant to City Atty. James K. 
Hahn.

MOUNTAINS AGENCY WINS RIGHT TO SEIZE SOKA UNIVERSITY LAND; ENVIRONMENT: COLLEGE 
VOWS TO APPEAL JUDGE'S RULING. PRICE THE CONSERVANCY MUST PAY FOR THE CALABASAS 
PROPERTY WILL BE DETERMINED BY A JURY.

<P>
 In a victory for the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy, a judge this week 
ruled that the agency may condemn Soka University's scenic Calabasas campus for 
public parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Barnet Cooperman's ruling Thursday changes the focus in the fight for 
the campus, from whether the conservancy may condemn to how much it must pay -- 
the price ultimately to be determined by a jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks officials have long coveted the land as a showpiece acquisition that 
would feature a visitors center for the Santa Monica Mountains National 
Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as conservancy lawyers savored the victory outside the courtroom, Soka 
spokesman Jeff Ourvan vowed that the university would appeal the ruling and 
characterized the conservancy as a victim of its own success. 
</P>
<P>
 "This ruling ironically kills the conservancy's effectiveness," he said, 
explaining that it "forces them to begin selling off existing parkland to start 
saving for the Soka acquisition." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the toughest part of the conservancy's fight may lie ahead. Although 
conservancy officials have set aside more than $19 million to buy out Soka, the 
jury may award the school many millions more, perhaps pricing the land beyond 
the agency's reach. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the conservancy board will meet to discuss which of its park 
holdings could be sold to raise cash. Already, Executive Director Joseph T. 
Edmiston has told the board that all new acquisitions -- such as the Canyon 
Oaks project in Topanga Canyon -- must be put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 The conservancy -- a state agency that acquires parkland -- is trying to take 
over 245 of Soka's 662 acres at Las Virgenes Road and Mulholland Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka, on the other hand, wants to expand its 200-student language school into 
a liberal arts college with an enrollment of 3,500 at the site, which includes 
the former ranch of razor magnate King Gillette. The school rejected an offer 
to buy the property in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the conservancy can afford the ultimate price of the land, Soka 
lawyers have threatened to sue to force the agency to purchase the remaining 
417 acres, arguing that they would then become unusable. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the conservancy and Soka had hoped to avoid the expensive legal 
fight that lies ahead -- which will cost the public millions of dollars 
regardless of which side wins. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a tentative settlement agreement between the two, Soka would have sold 
to the conservancy much of the land it is seeking to condemn through eminent 
domain -- including the historic Gillette mansion and grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Soka, in turn, would have built a scaled-down campus for 2,500 students on the 
eastern part of the property. The deal would have taken effect only after the 
school's plans were approved by the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 But faced with intense criticism from a coalition of homeowners, 
environmentalists and elected officials, the conservancy board rejected the 
settlement offer and vowed to press ahead with the case.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; NOT A SHELTER BUT A HOME FOR THE HOMELESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hillview Village is not a shelter, its developers say. And it's not a mental 
institution. It is a complex for homeless, mentally disabled adults. 
</P>
<P>
 But the developers simply refer to it as an apartment building, with 50 future 
tenants who say they prize it almost as much as they value their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 For Carlos Contreras, 37, who next week will move into Hillview -- the 
Valley's first low-rent complex of its kind -- the building represents an 
investment of trust and responsibility that he has never before experienced. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this means is, trust in yourself," Contreras said, looking around the 
spacious community room on the first level of the sprawling two-story building 
on Van Nuys Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 In a courtyard outside, local politicians and leaders were speaking before a 
small crowd at a ceremony marking the opening of the $5.6-million home, built 
with a combination of public and private loans.  
</P>
<P>
 "The community trusts, too," Contreras said, finishing his thought. "This is 
progress." 
</P>
<P>
 It's the kind of progress the San Fernando Valley and the rest of Los Angeles 
can build on, say doctors, patients and advocates for the homeless and mentally 
ill. While shelters are common, there are few places the homeless and mentally 
disabled can live permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 There are still fewer places that allow them to tackle problems at their own 
pace, with the goal that they need not be so heavily dependent on welfare, 
doctors and others.  
</P>
<P>
 Hillview Village was created by Hillview Mental Health Center Inc. and the 
Valley Housing Foundation to provide a comfortable living environment combined 
with easy access to support services.  
</P>
<P>
 The rooms range in size from 280 square feet for a single with a large 
bathroom, to 550 square feet for a one-bedroom unit with its own kitchen. They 
are carpeted and fully furnished. Rents range between $266 and $351, depending 
on the income of the tenant. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw Scott, 36, a peer counselor at Hillview and a future tenant, said 
he's looking forward to moving to the building from his apartment in Sun 
Valley. "Most people who will be coming here live in some kind of boarding care 
facility or an independent living arrangement, like me. 
</P>
<P>
 "This place is a lot nicer. I'm enthused. It gives us a choice," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify for residency, tenants must be homeless or formerly homeless, and 
be diagnosed with a mental disability, said Alicia Donerson, assistant 
administrator at Hillview Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is such a positive thing," said Dino Tripodis, a psychiatrist who works 
with the homeless mentally ill. "When the homeless get off the streets, they 
often are shipped around from place to place, and they become dependent. This 
is one of the first attempts, that I'm aware of, that seeks to globalize the 
kind of care these people need." 
</P>
<P>
 The apartment building's new tenants will move in Thursday, not a minute too 
soon for some. "My clients have been experiencing a bit of anticipatory 
anxiety," Tripodis said. TIM MAY

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: JACKSON FAMILY SUED BY APPAREL MAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN O'NEILL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Accusing the Jackson family of "duplicitous" business dealings, attorneys for 
a French clothing manufacturer filed a lawsuit seeking more than $17 million, 
contending that the entertainers reneged on an exclusive deal to market the 
Jackson family name and logo on a line of jeans and sportswear. 
</P>
<P>
 In the suit, the Nelson clothing company of Toulouse, France, alleges that the 
Jackson family violated a June, 1991, contract granting Nelson "exclusive use 
of the name and logo of 'the Jackson Family' on any and all products 
manufactured and distributed" by Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
 Named in the suit alleging fraud and breach of contract were Jackson 
Communications Inc. family patriarch Joseph Jackson, superstars Michael and 
Janet Jackson, as well as other family members including Tito, Marlon, LaToya 
and Germaine Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys Michael Brush and Michael Sacks contend that after the Jacksons 
signed the contract giving exclusive rights to Nelson and its president, Tony 
Elichia, the family formed a Swiss company called United Talents Group and 
began soliciting other, similar business arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 The attorneys said the Jacksons were paid $100,000 for licensing rights and 
additional royalty payments that amounted to hundreds of thousands of dollars. 
Many of those payments were in cash, Brush said. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the Jackson family could not be reached. However, Jay 
Lavely, an attorney for Michael Jackson, said his client "denies he did 
anything wrongful, fraudulent or improper" and that Michael Jackson never 
granted the Nelson company the right to use his name or likeness for commercial 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a court exhibit attached to the lawsuit, Joseph Jackson wrote a 
letter in March, 1994, terminating the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jacksons have been hit during the past year with several lawsuits alleging 
breach of contract in connection with the financially troubled Jackson Family 
Honors television special. In addition, Michael Jackson paid millions earlier 
this year to settle a lawsuit filed by a 14-year-old boy who accused Jackson of 
sexually molesting him. ANN O'NEILL

3.6 QUAKE FELT IN OJAI VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A magnitude-3.6 earthquake jolted the Ojai Valley on Friday evening, but left 
no reports of damage or injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake hit at 6:34 p.m. and was centered about six miles west of Ojai.It 
was not an aftershock of the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, said Riley Geary, a 
seismologist at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Dispatchers with the Ventura County Sheriff's Department received about 25 
calls from Ojai residents curious about the quake. None reported any problems, 
said Sgt. Chris Lathrop. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Ventura County Fire Department's station in Meiners Oaks, the quake was 
felt in two parts -- a slight shaking followed by a sharper jolt, said Capt. 
Norm Plott. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt like a rumble and then like a mini-jolt real close together," he 
said. "We actually heard a little bit of noise, a little rumble or something 
but not anything pronounced." 
</P>
<P>
 Following department policy, the station's four firefighters moved an engine 
and truck outside for about an hour to guard against any damage from possible 
aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Plott said the quake knocked a pipe in the station's bathroom loose causing 
water to briefly spew across the floor until it was repaired. JULIE FIELDS

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; $1.8 MILLION AWARDED VICTIM OF ASSAULT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A jury Friday awarded almost $2 million damages to a woman who sued funk 
singer Rick James for beating and imprisoning her in his hotel room two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel was also held liable for damages because the jury found that its 
management was negligent in its obligation to safeguard its guests, said Paul 
Sigelman, attorney for plaintiff Mary Sauer. 
</P>
<P>
 Sigelman said the jury will return to Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs' 
courtroom Monday to decide punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 James' attorney, Richard Morse, was not available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The singer, best known for his 1981 hit "Super Freak," was convicted in 1993 
of assaulting another woman at his Studio City home and Sauer at the St. 
James's Club & Hotel in West Hollywood. He was ordered to serve five years and 
four months in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 While out on bail in 1992 for the first assault, James invited Sauer to the 
hotel room he was sharing with his girlfriend, Tanya Anne Hijazi, for a 
business meeting. After the meeting was over, Sigelman said, James -- coming 
down from a cocaine binge -- restrained and assaulted Sauer over a period of 12 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point during the attack, the two ordered room service, Sigelman said, 
and Sauer begged the waiter for help. Although the waiter alerted the hotel's 
security guards, who alerted the management, nothing was done, Sigelman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury, which deliberated for two days after four weeks of testimony, found 
the hotel liable for more than $700,000 of the total damages. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hotel had the ability to prevent further injury and failed to act," 
Sigelman said, adding metaphorically that "Rick James started the fire, but the 
hotel failed to put it out when they knew about it and had an obligation to do 
so." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to more than $200,000 in lost future earnings, Sigelman asked the 
jury to give Sauer the same feeling of security afforded to both the hotel and 
to James.  
</P>
<P>
 A hotel security guard earns about $12 and hour, Sigelman told the jurors. He 
then asked that they consider how many hours it would take Sauer to feel secure 
and then multiply that number by 12 to get an appropriate dollar amount. The 
jury awarded her $1.6 million for her emotional distress. ABIGAIL GOLDMAN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SYLMAR; DEAL TO PROTECT OAK WOODLAND REACHED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM MAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ending a seven-year feud between developers and environmentalists, the Santa 
Monica Mountains Conservancy has agreed to purchase a 246-acre tract of 
woodland in Wilson Canyon, protecting the area from residential development. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), conservancy Director Joseph T. Edmiston, 
and Tim Cantwell, owner of Cantwell-Anderson Inc., the Altadena developer that 
owns the land, will make the truce official today when they meet to announce 
the $3.9-million purchase agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson Canyon, which lies above Sylmar, includes an oak forest and trails 
popular with nature lovers, hikers and equestrians. Katz became involved in 
preserving the canyon seven years ago when Cantwell-Anderson proposed a housing 
development there. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the developer tried compromising with critics of its development by 
cutting the proposed number of homes to be built from 535 to 250, Katz and 
other elected officials, including then Los Angeles City Councilman Ernani 
Bernardi and county Supervisor Ed Edelman, continued their opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The area inside the canyon provides an important link to the Rim of the Valley 
Trail, which is made up of more than 100 miles of hiking and equestrian trails 
that snake across the Santa Monica, San Gabriel, Santa Susana, Simi and Verdugo 
ranges.  
</P>
<P>
 Katz said Thursday that the purchase agreement is one of the few benefits of 
the recent economic recession. "Had there been a building boom going on, this 
deal might not have happened," Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of a sluggish economy and a depressed housing market, a recent 
appraisal of the land came in lower than expected, about $3.9 million, putting 
the price of the canyon within reach of the conservancy.  
</P>
<P>
 A 1990 appraisal of the land put its worth at between $6 million and $6.5 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal marks a rare conservancy incursion into an area outside the Santa 
Monica Mountains, where the organization traditionally has focused its efforts 
to preserve open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said he hopes the conservancy's involvement signals a new willingness to 
preserve areas in the northeast Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Middle-class families deserve open space just as much as the folks in Bel-Air 
do," Katz said. "This is a good sign." 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement of the agreement will be made at 10 a.m. in a field off Olive 
View Drive near the Olive View-UCLA Medical Center. After the announcement, 
Katz and his wife, Gini Barrett, will lead horseback riders into the canyon.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; VOTE IS DELAYED ON ENVIRONMENT REPORT 
</P>

<P>
 After hearing 10 hours of debate over two days, Thousand Oaks planning 
commissioners have again delayed a vote on an environmental report about a 
$100-million shopping center planned for Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Adjourning shortly after midnight Thursday, commissioners said they still had 
questions about the project's potential to harm the environment, and set 
another hearing for this Thursday.Commissioner Linda Parks dominated debate 
over the Seventh-day Adventist project, expressing concerns about noise and the 
project's conflicts with the city's General Plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Several commissioners said Friday that Parks took her probe too far, refusing 
to listen to the advice of city experts. 
</P>
<P>
 "She just kept questioning them like a district attorney," commission Chairman 
Irving Wasserman said. "She picked on every single word, comma and period." 
</P>
<P>
 Parks apologized Friday for monopolizing the session, but said she had a 
responsibility to ask questions if portions of the environmental report were 
unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need to make sure that mitigation is sufficient," Parks said. "I want to be 
confident about all the information before I cast my vote." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the issues discussed Thursday rehashed questions raised on Monday, 
when commissioners first tackled the document that details environmental 
effects of the 179-acre project. 
</P>
<P>
 One new concern -- the failure of the report to examine the possibility that 
water on the site may be contaminated -- caught the attention of several 
commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something that we need to look into a little further," Wasserman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he said the commission is expected to vote on the document this 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 If the environmental report is approved, the planners will then consider the 
entire project, which proposes construction of a shopping center, a school 
campus and a restaurant on part of 458 acres of rugged terrain north of the 
Ventura Freeway near Wendy Drive. MATTHEW MOSK

<P>
 A 37-year-old Oxnard woman has been arrested on suspicion of using teen-agers 
to sell heroin and cocaine, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with arresting Cecilia Zaragoza Morales, undercover detectives also took 
three juveniles, ages 14 to 16, into custody on suspicion of selling narcotics. 
All of the arrests were made earlier this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-month investigation that led to the arrests was part of the Oxnard 
Police Department's Operation Revitalization program. The grant-funded program 
targets youths ages 14 to 18 who are involved in drug- or alcohol-related 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, detectives assigned to Operation Revitalization arrested a 
man who was using his 12-year-old brother to sell drugs out of a south Oxnard 
home. JULIE FIELDS

EASTERN ORTHODOX BRANCHES PLEDGE TO WORK TOWARD UNITY; DENOMINATIONS: TOGETHER, 
THEY REPRESENT 6 MILLION ORTHODOX CHRISTIANS. UNITED CHURCH INTENDS TO SPEAK 
WITH ONE VOICE ON MATTERS OF SOCIAL AND THEOLOGICAL IMPORTANCE.

<P>
 Eastern Orthodox denominations in North America, long divided by ethnicity and 
language, took a major step toward unity Thursday, pledging to work toward 
formation of a united church. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the American public to know that the Orthodox have come of age, and 
we are going to act as one united church," said Archbishop Iakovos, primate of 
the Greek Orthodox Church and the senior Orthodox leader in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the Greek Orthodox, the churches joining in the unity agreement 
include the Orthodox Church in America, the nation's second-largest Orthodox 
group with roots in Russia; the Antiochian Orthodox, with a large Syrian and 
Lebanese membership, and the Serbian, Romanian, Bulgarian and Carpatho-Russian 
Orthodox churches. Together, they represent 6 million Orthodox Christians. 
</P>
<P>
 Not included in the unity agreement are the so-called Oriental Orthodox 
churches -- Armenian, Coptic and Syrian Orthodox -- which continue to have 
theological differences with Eastern Orthodoxy over issues relating to the 
incarnation of God in Jesus Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the agreement, the churches intend to speak with one voice on 
matters of social and theological importance. But other ramifications of 
unification -- such as the appointment of priests and bishops and shared 
finances -- remain uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 The unity agreement, announced at a news conference arranged by the Standing 
Conference of Canonical Orthodox Bishops in the Americas, made public two major 
statements adopted at a meeting of Orthodox bishops in Ligonier, Pa., Nov. 30 
to Dec. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 At that meeting, bishops representing the nation's major Eastern Orthodox 
faith groups acknowledged a "North American reality" in which, they said, 
ethnic boundaries dissolve as immigrants are absorbed into the mainstream, 
making ethnically centered churches less responsive to the needs of American 
society. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe our task in North America is not limited to serving the immigrant 
and ethnic communities, but has at its very heart the missionary task, the task 
of making disciples," the bishops said in a statement on church mission and 
evangelism adopted in Ligonier. 
</P>
<P>
 The bishops also issued a joint plea to their mother churches overseas and the 
Ecumenical Patriarch Bartholomew in Istanbul, considered the "first among 
equals" among Orthodox the world over, asking that the issue of a unified 
Orthodox presence in North America be made a top priority. 
</P>
<P>
 The advent of Orthodoxy in the United States is usually tied to the 
establishment of a Russian Orthodox mission in Alaska in 1783. 
</P>
<P>
 As waves of immigrants crossed the Atlantic from Eastern Europe in the past 
century, they brought native customs, languages and worship traditions. 
Orthodox parishes have served not only as houses of worship, but as beacons of 
cultural identity. Some parishes with older memberships still conduct services 
in Russian, Greek and other Eastern European languages. 
</P>
<P>
 But fragmentation has hampered the collective influence of the Orthodox, 
church leaders believe, and the latest drive toward unity could serve as a 
corrective measure. 
</P>
<P>
 Metropolitan Philip, leader of the Antiochian Orthodox Church, described the 
unification effort as "unity with pastoral diversity." 
</P>
<P>
 Many Orthodox parishes, he observed, are composed mainly of recent immigrants, 
and in those situations it is expected that native tongues will continue to be 
used in church services instead of English. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not against that at all," said Philip. "These are pastoral situations 
which can very easily be solved."

SONGWRITER SOUGHT AFTER SLAYING IN WOODLAND HILLS 
</P>

<P>
 A Chicago songwriter sought by police in connection with the slaying of a 
Woodland Hills man is also wanted for questioning in a 6-month-old missing 
persons case in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles and Chicago police are looking for Jack Goga, 50, who drove from 
Chicago to Los Angeles in May with Digna Adames, 25, who has not been heard 
from since.Neighbors of Charles (Chick) Evans, 60, whose corpse was discovered 
by police in his Del Valle Avenue home Wednesday, say Goga had lived in Evans' 
house for several months and was an odd counterpoint to the neighborly Evans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chick was a very outgoing, friendly person, and the other guy (Goga) would 
just stand there," said Jerry Cowart, who has lived a few doors away from Evans 
for 12 years. Goga "would never talk to anyone. He just seemed like a cold 
man." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Evans' friends, concerned after not hearing from him for several days, 
found Evans' bullet-riddled corpse on the floor of his one-story house 
Wednesday afternoon. Gone were Goga and Evans' 1972 yellow Volvo station wagon. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans' neighbors said he was a quiet man with an affinity for cars. Evans was 
also an avid gun collector and used to take weekend trips with his wife into 
the desert to shoot weapons, neighbors said. After Evans' wife died several 
years ago, "he pretty much became a recluse," said Fred Jennings, who lives 
across the street,  
</P>
<P>
 It is unknown whether any of Evans' vast gun collection was taken, police 
said.

EMBATTLED LANDFILL MANAGER OUSTED; SANITATION: AIR-QUALITY VIOLATIONS AT LOPEZ 
CANYON DUMP IN LAKE VIEW TERRACE LEAD TO STAFF SHAKE-UP. ASSEMBLYMAN AND 
COUNCILMAN CALL FOR ITS CLOSURE. 
</P>

<P>
 As state and local officials called for the closure of the Lopez Canyon 
Landfill in the wake of recent air-quality emission violations, Los Angeles 
sanitation officials Friday announced a management shake-up at the Lake View 
Terrace dump. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said that in the next two weeks they will assign Steve Fortune, 
head of the city's solid waste management division, to take over day-to-day 
operations from longtime landfill manager John De la Rosa. 
</P>
<P>
 J. P. Ellman, president of the city's Board of Public Works, which oversees 
the dump, said she hopes the management reorganization will increase scrutiny 
of the landfill's operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some things that happened recently in Lopez Canyon that could have 
been avoided and should have been avoided if procedures were followed," she 
said. "I'm very unhappy that procedures have not been followed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the Air Quality Management District board issued landfill managers 
three citations: two for failing to capture leaking gas fumes in a collection 
system and one for failing to cover exposed waste. 
</P>
<P>
 The emissions, according to one witness, have a "sickly-sweet smell" that 
drifts into adjacent neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the air quality board has yet to decide on penalties for the 
violations, it can impose fines of up to $50,000 per day. The board does not 
have the authority to close the dump, but the state Integrated Waste Management 
board and the city can shut it down. 
</P>
<P>
 The management shake-up came at the same time that Assemblyman Richard Katz 
(D-Sylmar) and Los Angeles Councilman Richard Alarcon called for closing the 
400-acre dump. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Dec. 7 letter to the Integrated Waste Management board, Katz said the 
violations are only the latest examples of the threat the landfill presents to 
nearby residents. He urged the board to shut it and launch an investigation 
into safety there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people of Los Angeles will not suffer from closure of Lopez, as there is 
more than enough landfill capacity in the area available at a reasonable 
price," he said in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz's request came only a week after Alarcon cited the emission problems as a 
reason why the city should close the landfill when its permit expires in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just one more example in a long series of incidents that call for the 
closure of this monstrosity in my district," he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 De la Rosa, who has managed the landfill for nine years, is Alarcon's second 
cousin. Ellman said De la Rosa will be reassigned to study efficiency in the 
sanitation bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 The criticism from Katz and Alarcon is not new. Both are long-time opponents 
of the dump and have called for its closing in response to growing community 
protests. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent violations, however, do not seem serious enough to merit closing 
the dump, said Pat Macht, a spokeswoman for the Integrated Waste Management 
board. 
</P>
<P>
 Macht said staff members will review Katz's request, probably determining next 
week what actions to take. In the meantime, however, she said, it does not 
appear that an urgent shutdown of the landfill was necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "Closing a landfill is generally considered a last-resort measure," Macht 
said. "We have to be careful we don't go to immediate closure and create a 
garbage pileup." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An air quality board spokeswoman said the violations are not life-threatening 
and are typical of area landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lopez Canyon Landfill "usually does a better job of self-monitoring than 
other landfills," said spokeswoman Lisha Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanitation officials said they are addressing the problems cited by the air 
quality board, and Ellman said she expects the management reorganization will 
eliminate future problems. The new executive, Fortune, "will step up quality 
control," she said.

SEX TAPE DISTRIBUTOR FINED $10,000 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Canoga Park distributor of sex videotapes was ordered to donate $10,000 to 
Children of the Night, the nonprofit group that helps young runaways, after 
being convicted of a misdemeanor for selling obscene videos, the city 
attorney's office said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fantastic Pictures Inc. was also placed on two years' probation and barred 
from disseminating any materials depicting rape, bestiality, sex with minors or 
other illegal acts. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Municipal Court Commissioner Barry Kohn imposed the sentence after 
company attorneys entered a no-contest plea to a charge of committing a public 
nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
 The case began in January, when undercover LAPD vice detectives attended a 
consumer electronics show in Las Vegas and spotted brochures for videos at a 
booth operated by Zane Entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives learned that Zane Entertainment and Fantastic Pictures were under 
common management from 21528 Osborne St., Canoga Park. They conducted 
surveillance, made two undercover buys of videotapes and conducted a search of 
the offices, finding the evidence for Friday's conviction. LESLIE BERGER

HIGH COST OF STILTS; QUAKE VICTIMS SEEK WAIVER OF FEMA RULE ON EXTRA HEIGHT FOR 
HOUSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In the anguish-filled days following the Jan. 17 earthquake, when many victims 
were fretting over damage and mourning their losses, Simi Valley resident 
Louise Kisting whirled into action. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than a week after the tragedy, the recently widowed grandmother beat a 
path to the city's Building and Safety Department, the first homeowner to 
secure permission to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 "The neighbors said, 'Your house is going to be the first one restored, so 
when all our houses are back together, we'll have the party at your place,' " 
Kisting, 59, recalled. "I thought, 'Yes, it will be done by the summer and we 
can have a party by the pool.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a year and $90,000 in contractor's fees later, there has been no party 
and a puddle of slime festers at the bottom of the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Kisting's wood-frame, two-story house on the east end of the city is a 
stripped-down shell she can hardly bear to look at without bursting into tears. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the delay? 
</P>
<P>
 In April, well after Kisting's contractor had ripped out carpets, torn down 
walls and repaired cracked beams, the city learned from the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency that because Kisting lives in a flood plain, she must rebuild 
her house on stilts. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the city is pressing reluctant FEMA officials to grant exceptions for 
residents who have spent substantial time and money on repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 While the city and FEMA tussle, at least a dozen homeowners, Kisting among 
them, have been told they must comply. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've put all this money into my house, and now they're telling me I have to 
tear it down and start over," Kisting said. "How can this happen?" 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is a city ordinance enforced by the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency requiring that damaged homes in a flood zone be built as high as five 
feet off the ground if repairs will cost at least half the value of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Such platforms, which in many cases are not covered by insurance, cost about 
$25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is planning to conduct an in-depth survey of quake-damaged homes at 
the east end of town to figure out how many are subject to the requirement, 
Assistant City Manager Mike Sedell said. So far the city knows of about a dozen 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't expect to find too many more," Sedell said. "But we want to make 
sure absolutely sure that we don't miss anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting with FEMA and city officials, residents in the flood zone this 
week denounced the regulation, arguing that forcing homeowners to rebuild their 
houses above ground is an undue financial burden on quake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 They also voiced concerns that houses built on stilts rather than solid ground 
will be more prone to damage in future quakes and that the looming homes will 
mar neighborhood aesthetics and lower property values. 
</P>
<P>
 During the nearly six-hour meeting at City Hall, the angry homeowners also 
berated the city for not telling them about the elevation requirement 
immediately after the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventy-two homeowners signed a petition asking for an exemption from the 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a perfect example of the government coming in and really messing 
things up for people," said Lorrell Cooper, who lives near Kisting. "People are 
out here trying to get their lives back together, and what do they get? Just a 
bunch of messed-up information from the city and from FEMA." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Greg Stratton defended the city, saying workers were eager to help 
residents any way they could. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to fault my staff for trying to help people rebuild their 
houses," Stratton said. "The real frustration is trying to find a way to 
understand and work through FEMA's rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Until June, city workers were including only structural repairs such as 
foundations, walls and fireplaces when assessing whether the total cost of 
repairs equaled at least half the value of the house, in which case the house 
would have to be elevated. 
</P>
<P>
 Then FEMA stepped in and said all improvements, even cosmetic work like 
drapes, carpeting, light fixtures and paint, must be included in the cost of 
repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA keeps "moving the target, so we don't look like we have a solid system," 
Sedell said. "We're continuing to be whipsawed back and forth." 
</P>
<P>
 If the city allows homeowners to rebuild in defiance of the elevation 
requirement without FEMA approval, the agency could suspend Simi Valley from 
the flood insurance program. Residents would then be unable to get federally 
backed loans for mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
 The homes are included in a flood zone in large part because of their 
proximity to the Arroyo Simi, a flood control channel that runs the length of 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 When the city joined the flood control district in 1991, most homes along the 
arroyo were considered at risk in a catastrophic flood. According to FEMA 
engineers there is a 1% or greater chance that these homes will flood in any 
given year. 
</P>
<P>
 City historian Patricia Havens said she is unaware of any flood of that 
magnitude in Simi Valley's past. 
</P>
<P>
 "Records show that we've had six or seven very bad floods over the years, as 
far back as 1914," Havens said. "There isn't a record of any major flooding 
before that, and none of these floods has caused what you would call major or 
catastrophic damage." 
</P>
<P>
 The arroyo suffered severe damage in the Jan. 17 earthquake, and the county 
Public Works Agency has applied for a $2.9-million FEMA grant to completely 
overhaul the channel. It would cost an additional $800,000 to replace a 
railroad crossing over the channel, a critical part of the project, said 
Dolores B. Taylor, county flood control engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 If the funding is approved, the project could be completed by next fall, 
Taylor said, dramatically decreasing the flood risk to nearby homes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jack Eldridge, chief of FEMA's community mitigation program for 
California, is less optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with this is that flood control projects historically take longer 
than anybody would have guessed," Eldridge said. "Often when you have multiple 
parties, they get into a headlock and nothing gets done." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the city has commissioned a study to show which homes would be 
removed from the flood zone if the Arroyo Simi is rebuilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners argue that they should not be forced to rebuild their homes on 
stilts if they will no longer be in the flood zone in less than a year.  
</P>
<P>
 But Eldridge said FEMA is extremely reluctant to grant exemptions, known as 
variances, to the rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing you want to avoid is that occasionally cities have given variances 
that were inappropriate," he said. "The residents get bills for flood insurance 
that was $5,000 or $6,000 a year, and they gag. With no project in sight, those 
buildings become a white elephant for the owners and the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, while the city and FEMA slug it out over what to include in the cost 
analysis for repairs and whether exemptions to the elevation rule will be 
granted, the homeowners wait. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, the flood zone building requirements are the most recent in a string 
of setbacks and government rigmarole that has kept them from rebuilding their 
homes and getting on with their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kisting's neighborhood, empty houses, cracked and boarded up, are common. 
Dumpsters seem permanently rooted in front of many homes, and piles of bricks 
and debris litter the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aurelia Street, Mike Riley's three-bedroom bungalow is stripped to the 
crack-infested concrete floor. He and his wife live in a rented apartment in 
Newbury Park.  
</P>
<P>
 A chain link fence separates Riley's property from the arroyo, just a few feet 
from his rubble-strewn back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 For several months after the quake, Riley, 46, proceeded with plans to rebuild 
his home. In June he discovered that his house must be elevated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just going along, minding my own business and then they tell me, 'You 
gotta raise your house five feet,' " Riley said. "I said, 'You're crazy. You're 
on drugs.' "

 After giving the matter more consideration, Riley, a deputy sheriff for Los 
Angeles County, decided to comply. Fed up with waiting for a decision on 
whether he may be exempt, Riley plans to tear down his home and reconstruct it 
five feet in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 His insurance company, he said, will not cover the cost of the platform. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know one thing," he said. "When this house is rebuilt five feet off the 
ground it will meet every stinkin' requirement in the book." 
</P>
<P>
 Around the corner on a cul de sac on Dulcie Street sits yet another vacant, 
stripped-own house. 
</P>
<P>
 This one belongs to Patricia Storey, 54, who bought the cozy four-bedroom home 
with her daughter and son-in-law in 1988 and spent $20,000 remodeling it before 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Kisting, Storey was issued permits by the city that were later revoked. 
Now she is waiting to hear whether the $50,000 she has sunk into repairs has 
been wasted. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I have to elevate this house, I'll have to tear it down," said Storey, who 
runs an office supply store in Van Nuys. "What about all the money I've already 
spent? This is just crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Kisting, she said she is just about ready to give up hope that her home 
will ever be repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent, windy morning, Kisting stood in her empty living room. 
</P>
<P>
 As the cold wind gusted mercilessly through the house's stripped frame, she 
pulled out a photograph taken there last Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 In it, her grandson is snuggled in an overstuffed chair in front of the 
fireplace in the glow of an ornament-laden tree, grinning shyly at the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not doing anything for the holidays this year," she said, her eyes 
glistening with tears as she quickly stuffed the photo into her purse. "I don't 
have a home. What's the point?"

A CLOSER LOOK AT ISLAM IN THE WEST; MUSLIMS: SURVEY FINDS FEWER ADHERENTS THAN 
PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED, BUT CONFIRMS THAT THE RELIGION MAY BE AMONG FASTEST 
GROWING IN U.S. AND CANADA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The first scientific survey of mosques has found that organized Islam in the 
United States and Canada, although growing rapidly, is no larger than a small 
Christian denomination of about 500,000 adherents -- a finding which may 
sharply lower many previous estimates of the total Muslim population. 
</P>
<P>
 The study nevertheless indicated that Islam may be, as reputed, one of the 
continent's fastest-growing religions, which at the current rate of growth 
would overtake Judaism early in the next century as the second-largest 
religious group -- after Christianity -- on the continent. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 80% of the 1,046 Muslim congregations, mostly in the United States, 
were formed in the past 25 years, according to the survey directed by the 
Islamic Resource Institute of Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Religious scholars praised the survey as a long-sought starting point for 
establishing a factual profile of Islam in the United States and Canada, with 
its mix of mostly Indo-Pakistani and Arab immigrants and African American 
converts. A summary of the still-unpublished survey is included in a new Muslim 
resource guide for the news media, of which The Times obtained an advance copy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first solid research in this area," said sociologist Wade Clark Roof 
of UC Santa Barbara, who helped construct the poll. Roof is president-elect of 
the Society for the Scientific Study of Religion. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey results should reduce some estimates of the overall American Muslim 
population, said Ihsan Bagby, who completed the study this year before taking a 
faculty position in international studies at Shaw University in Raleigh, N.C.  
</P>
<P>
 Some previous estimates by scholars and religious leaders have placed the 
number of Muslims in the United States and Canada at 6 million to 8 million. 
But because Islamic scholars commonly contend that only about 10% of American 
and Canadian Muslims attend mosques, the new study's count of about 500,000 
mosque-goers indicates a population of 4.6 million to 5 million, Bagby said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, that is well above the 2 million or less estimated by separate 
national surveys in 1991 by the Gallup Poll and City University of New York. 
Islamic leaders disagreed with those findings as too low, saying that new 
immigrants and black converts are often missed by conventional polling. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, other studies show that there are about 6 million Jews in the 
United States and Canada. That is only about 20% more than Bagby's estimate of 
the Muslim population, even though the number of Muslims was negligible until 
the 1960s, while Jews have been established on the continent for more than a 
century. 
</P>
<P>
 To arrive at the figure of nearly 500,000 Muslims who attend mosques, the 
survey's researchers asked each Islamic center how many people take part in 
activities other than Islam's two major feast days -- one marking the end of 
the fasting month of Ramadan and another that celebrates the time of the annual 
pilgrimage to Mecca. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagby said that the average number of such active participants per 
congregation was 465 people, which he multiplied by the 1,046 known mosques -- 
or masjids, an Arabic term for "house of prayer" that Muslims prefer. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagby attributed the rapid growth of Islamic centers to a combination of 
immigration, conversions and births. "Based on immigration and conversion 
(rates) alone," he said, "it is safe to say that the Muslim population is 
growing a minimum of 125,000 a year." At that rate, the Muslim population would 
surpass the number of Jews in the United States and Canada by 2010, Bagby said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether many of those people will associate with local Islamic centers is an 
open question. "The notion of masjid membership is not strong among Muslims," 
Bagby conceded. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey showed that the actual numbers of "mosqued" Muslims -- those who 
take part in Islamic center prayers more than twice a year -- may be compared 
at best to the U.S. memberships of small Christian bodies such as the Church of 
the Nazarene, the nationwide Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod and the 
Orthodox Church in America, an Eastern Orthodox denomination. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Without a tally based on actual mosque membership, however, it has been 
difficult to gauge the true numbers of American Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always urged people not to exaggerate numbers of Muslims," said Salam 
Al-Marayati, director of the Muslim Public Affairs Council in Los Angeles. "It 
adds more to people's apprehensions than to people's understanding." 
</P>
<P>
 Many Muslims attend no mosque, in part, because in Middle Eastern, African and 
Asian nations, where it is often the dominant religion, Islam is not organized 
into the local church congregations common in North America, and immigrants are 
thus unaccustomed to establishing such affiliations, Al-Marayati said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagby said the study was conducted from mid-1992 to last March through 
telephone interviews with representatives of 341 masjids . 
</P>
<P>
 "Only a handful, fewer than 10, refused to participate," Bagby said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most accurate study to date," said Yvonne Haddad, a 
much-published scholar on Islam in America. Haddad, who teaches at the 
University of Massachusetts, noted that Bagby "had every big gun in Islamic 
leadership in North America supporting his research." 
</P>
<P>
 One expected finding was that most masjids are multicultural. Seven of every 
10 masjids have more than one ethnic group worshiping there, Bagby said. Either 
African-Americans or Indo-Pakistanis were the largest ethnic groups at most 
masjids, followed closely by Arab-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York City area has the largest number of masjids, 98, followed by the 
Chicago metropolitan area with 60 and Southern California with 55, the study 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Southern California ranked second highest in estimated total attendance at 
the traditional mid-day Friday prayers at its 55 masjids, with 11,858 
worshipers, compared to more than 27,000 in the New York area. (Devout Muslims 
are expected to pray five times daily, at home or work, and to attend a Friday 
service.)  
</P>
<P>
 The states with the largest numbers of masjids were New York (132), California 
(117), Illinois (74), New Jersey (60) and Texas (58). The highest attendance at 
Friday prayers was reported by 31 masjids in Washington, D.C. -- which had an 
average of 472 worshipers each -- and the 33 masjids in Toronto and the Ontario 
province of Canada, with an average of 328, the study said. 
</P>
<P>
 The average Friday attendance at Southern California masjids was reported to 
be 242, a figure which fails to reflect the much larger attendance at some 
major masjids.  
</P>
<P>
 For example, the large Islamic Center of Southern California on Vermont Avenue 
in Los Angeles attracts between 1,000 and 1,500 people every Friday, said 
Al-Marayati. And about 1,000 attend services at the Islamic Society of Orange 
County in Garden Grove, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Fernando Valley, combined attendance at two prayer services of the 
Islamic Center of Northridge on a recent Friday was between 320 and 360, said 
Hasan Mulla, president of the masjid. The Northridge masjid, which was 
organized in 1977, is constructing a new building in Granada Hills just north 
of the 118 Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller Valley area masjids hold Friday prayers in Van Nuys, North Hollywood 
and Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Islam in the United States has loose federations rather than denominations. 
The survey found that 39% of the masjids are affiliated with the Islamic 
Society of North America, based in Plainfield, Ind., and 30% are independent. 
The next largest segment, 20%, follow the lead of Imam W. Deen Mohammed of 
Chicago, who steered the once-sectarian black Muslim movement into the Islamic 
mainstream over the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nation of Islam, headed by controversial minister Louis Farrakhan, was not 
included in the survey, Bagby said. "The masjids we dealt with recognize each 
other as all belonging to the mainstream of Islam," and they do not consider 
Farrakhan's group in that mainstream, he said.

HOMELESS GET CHANCE TO COME IN FROM COLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gusty winds Friday blew in some much-needed good fortune for the homeless, 
prompting authorities to open the San Fernando Valley's only cold-weather 
emergency shelter for the second consecutive night.  
</P>
<P>
 Friday was only the fourth night since the winter shelter program went into 
effect nearly a month ago that up to 155 homeless men and women were permitted 
to bunk at the National Guard Armory in Van Nuys under a $2.4-million, 
federally funded program. 
</P>
<P>
 Through Monday, the shelter is opened only when there is a forecast of 
temperatures falling below 40 degrees or a 50% chance of rain. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters were predicting that temperatures Friday night would drop into the 
upper 30s in some parts of the Valley, with winds that had gusted up to 40 
m.p.h. earlier in the day tapering off toward morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Tuesday, all 22 cold-weather shelters throughout Los Angeles County 
will open nightly through March 31, regardless of the weather. 
</P>
<P>
 That will be welcome news to some of the 35,500 to 83,900 thinly clad homeless 
men and women who risk freezing to death by sleeping outdoors in chilly 
weather, said Gene Boutilier, executive director of the Los Angeles Homeless 
Services Authority, the joint county and city agency that manages the program. 
There are about 8,500 shelter beds open year-round throughout the county and 
2,000 extra in the winter.  
</P>
<P>
 Only 36 homeless people took refuge at the armory in the three nights prior to 
Friday that the shelter was open, but that number is expected to rise sharply 
as the weather grows wetter and colder and word gets around, said Nat Hutton, 
executive director of the Los Angeles Family Housing Corp., which operates the 
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 In the five years since the winter shelter program began, homeless advocates 
have succeeded in shortening the weather-activated portion and expanding the 
number of days the shelters are guaranteed to stay open. The 76-day period that 
begins Tuesday is six days longer than last year and 46 days longer than four 
seasons ago.  
</P>
<P>
 But some advocates want to eliminate the weather-activated portion of the 
program altogether, saying that the method used to determine whether to open 
the shelters is faulty. The final decision is made at 10 a.m. regardless of any 
changes in the weather later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's incredibly frustrating that they didn't open up the shelters when it's 
been so cold," said Bob Erlenbusch, executive director of the Los Angeles 
Coalition to End Homelessness.  
</P>
<P>
 Boutilier said that shelter workers need time to prepare the evening meal and 
arrange transportation for the homeless. Opening the shelters more often would 
be ideal but is impossible because of the agency's limited funds, he said. COLD

LAGUNA NIGUEL RESIDENTS URGE CITY TO USE DIFFERENT ANIMAL SHELTER; HEARING: 
GROUP CLAIMS COUNTY POUND IGNORES PETS. THEY WANT SHIFT TO NEW MISSION VIEJO 
FACILITY.

<P>
 Saying that county workers ignore pets and pet owners in South County, a group 
of local animal lovers asked the City Council on Tuesday to leave the county's 
animal control program and join the new Mission Viejo city-run animal shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal lovers accused the county agency of being slow to respond to injured 
and lost pets and of euthanizing unlicensed animals as soon as the mandatory 
three-day holding period is over. 
</P>
<P>
 "We care about our animals," resident Diane Argyle said. "We are not happy at 
all with the services of the county. It is not acceptable to kill any healthy 
animal." 
</P>
<P>
 But Judy Maitlen, the county's animal control director, said that the county 
shelter has a pro-humane policy and that her office has received no complaints 
about ongoing service problems from Laguna Niguel residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to have a shelter right across the freeway, that's your choice to 
make," Maitlen told the council. "But please don't make your decision based on 
a perception that we kill animals after three days. We don't have a need to do 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 Her comments drew angry shouts from animal lovers in the audience, who said 
that they prefer Mission Viejo's policy of keeping all healthy, unclaimed 
animals alive indefinitely by giving them to the Friends of Mission Viejo 
Animals. 
</P>
<P>
 They also said that telephone lines at the county shelter are constantly busy, 
forcing many people to give up trying to find lost pets. 
</P>
<P>
 The animal advocates also said the proximity of the $2.3-million Mission Viejo 
shelter would improve response times. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Tim Casey estimated that joining the Mission Viejo shelter would 
cost the city about $20,000 to $30,000 more per year than the current county 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the city would probably be required to pay $75,000 to $100,000 to 
expand the Mission Viejo shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 The council is expected to make a decision at its Dec. 20 meeting.

OLD TELEPHONE BOOKS GIVEN NEW LIVES

<P>
 Don't throw away your telephone books just yet. But if you do, drop them off 
at a recycling bin. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline for depositing old telephone books in one of 10 city recycling 
bins in the city has been extended to Dec. 20 because of a delay in delivery of 
the new books by Pacific Bell, said Florine Reichle, the assistant manager of 
the Costa Mesa Sanitary District. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to recycle as many books as we can, but we want residents to know 
that their new books won't be on their doorsteps until sometime next week," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the new books are delivered, Reichle said, residents can drop off their 
old ones at a number of locations, including City Hall at 77 Fair Drive, 
Coastline Community College or Orange Coast College. 
</P>
<P>
 Other sites include Lions Park at 18th Street and Anaheim Avenue, Shiffer Park 
at 3143 Bear St. and Heller Park at 257 E. 16th St. 
</P>
<P>
 "The recycling program is really neat this year because the books are going to 
be recycled into new directories at a paper mill in the state of Washington," 
said Reichle. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the city recycled 87 tons of telephone books, and sanitary district 
officials hope to surpass that amount this year in the name of a cleaner 
environment. 
</P>
<P>

AGENCY GIVES GROUPS VISION OF HOPE; PHILANTHROPY: CHRISTIAN RELIEF ORGANIZATION 
WILL DONATE BUILDING MATERIALS TO HELP 13 VALLEY CHURCHES AND CHARITIES MAKE 
QUAKE REPAIRS OR EXPAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A team of construction workers and church members have labored for five months 
to rebuild parts of the earthquake-damaged La Trinidad Church in San Fernando, 
a task made difficult by inadequate supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 But thanks to a shipment of building materials that will be donated by World 
Vision U. S. early next week, La Trinidad and 12 other churches and charities 
in the San Fernando Valley will be able to work full-force on their renovation 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 The Christian relief agency, which also assisted 3,800 families after the 
earthquake, will donate 25 truckloads of fiber-bond wallboard, paint and 
plastic supplies in its continuing effort to aid community organizations and 
those displaced by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have donated all the drywall. . . . The material is for the inside of 
the church," said Ron Laning, superintendent for Colombo Development, which is 
coordinating the reconstruction project for La Trinidad Church. 
</P>
<P>
 The church's sanctuary was destroyed in the Jan. 17 earthquake, forcing the 
congregation to worship in adjacent rooms. "They almost condemned the whole 
building, but we were able to save it," Laning said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gone out and really been intentional about working with a large number 
of groups in the Los Angeles area," said Tom Konjoyan, a spokesman for World 
Vision U. S. 
</P>
<P>
 World Vision was given 53 truckloads of building materials from Louisiana 
Pacific. About half was sent to those affected by the Georgia floods, and the 
rest will be distributed in the Valley to repair quake-damaged buildings and to 
help charities that need the material for expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jeopardy anti-gang youth center, for example, which is run by the LAPD's 
Foothill Division out of a large warehouse in Pacoima, will use the supplies to 
add on much-needed rooms, Officer Isaac Galvan said.  
</P>
<P>
 The new rooms will be used for boxing, basketball and other sports, as well as 
counseling centers for at-risk youth and their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "This worked out fantastically for us. . . . (The warehouse) is fine for what 
it was before . . . but we need the extra room," Galvan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The materials, which arrived on three train cars late Friday, are scheduled to 
be distributed Tuesday at a railroad yard in Panorama City. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Without World Vision) we would have still been in trailers until now," said 
Mike Bishay, pastor at Grenada Hills Community Church, which has received 
building supplies and at least $75,000 in aid from the agency. The church lost 
its Christian education facility in the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were blessed. . . . We didn't call for them, they came to us," Bishay 
said.

COMMENTARY; BEHIND JOLLY OL' ST. NICK, THERE IS A TALE OF LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Santa Claus is big this year, really big. 
</P>
<P>
 He's big every year about this time, but in 1994, Santa is especially big. Not 
only is there the usual Santa at Christmas stuff, but this year there are two 
new movies, "The Santa Clause" and a remake of the 1947 classic "Miracle on 
34th Street." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Claus -- a.k.a. St. Nicholas, Pere Noel, Father Christmas, St. Nick -- 
is based on Nicholas of Myra, a sainted, 4th-Century bishop in Asia Minor. 
Santa's common portrayal in red robes with ermine trim and floppy miter 
reflects his historic origins as a bishop of the church. 
</P>
<P>
 At various stages in his career, St. Nicholas was a patron of pawnbrokers, 
sailors, businessmen, traders and, of course, little children. This last 
function is the only one that has survived in modern memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the myths attributed to St. Nicholas, he took on some of the 
characteristics of Wodin, the Germanic god. Hence he acquired reindeer, elves 
and a headquarters at the North Pole. 
</P>
<P>
 As patron of children, Nicholas was said to have brought them gifts on his 
feast, which is celebrated Dec. 6. However, in many countries this duty was 
transferred to Christmas, the preferred time for gift-giving. 
</P>
<P>
 The crusaders brought back to Bari, Italy, a body that the citizens of Myra 
said was that of St. Nicholas, though it is not unreasonable to suspect that it 
wasn't the saint's body at all. (Indeed, it is not unreasonable to assume that 
this most popular of all non-Biblical saints never actually existed, not that 
his story loses anything.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The good citizens of Bari claimed Nicholas as their patron and in time, after 
stories about him traveled to northern Europe, Amsterdam also claimed him as 
patron. When the Dutch founded New Amsterdam, they brought Nick along and made 
him patron of Manhattan Island, which, heaven knows, has need of a patron 
saint. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa is more for grown-ups than for children. When I was watching the remake 
of "Miracle on 34th Street," the decision of the New York court to declare 
officially that there was indeed a Santa Claus was greeted with enthusiastic 
applause by all the adults in the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 It dawned on me that while children do enjoy Santa, grown-ups enjoy watching 
children enjoy Santa even more. The reason, I suspect, is not merely that 
adults delight in recalling the innocence of their childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing the Santa game with kids, adults half hope that those innocent 
fantasies may actually reveal more about the meaning of life than does our own 
cynical realism. 
</P>
<P>
 To ask if there really is a Santa Claus is not the right question. The proper 
question is whether Santa Claus reveals, as every metaphor purports to, a 
reality beyond himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Does he reveal to us a God who loves all of us as his little children? If 
there is such a God, that is very good news indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 If this God loved little children so much that he himself became a little 
child at the first Christmas, that is astonishingly good news. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa story is not simply a harmless tale that slipped from paganism into 
the Christian midwinter festival, but a metaphor that belongs at the heart of 
the Christmas celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 As Santa Claus gives gifts to children, so God gives gifts to us. The most 
fantastic thing about the Santa story is that it is true. And the story of St. 
Nicholas seems to become more popular every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Small wonder. Or maybe large wonder. The lives of saints are stories of God's 
love. The Claus cause is a hard story to beat.

SEASONAL CHEER SPREAD BY 'USA: MUSLIM'S DAY'; CELEBRATIONS: COMING DEC. 16, THE 
HOLIDAY IS NOT BASED ON RELIGION OR CULTURE. AN ISLAMIC GROUP CREATED IT TO 
OFFER AN ALTERNATIVE OBSERVANCE.

<P>
 There's Hanukkah. There's Christmas. There's Kwanzaa. 
</P>
<P>
 Now add "USA: Muslim's Day" to an increasingly crowded December holiday 
calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 USA: Muslim's Day is the 11-year-old creation of the New York-based National 
Council on Islamic Affairs. The holiday falls on the third Friday -- the Muslim 
sabbath -- of December, which this year is Dec. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 While the day is still largely unknown, two New York banking giants -- Chase 
Manhattan and Citibank -- have included references to the celebration in 
seasonal holiday displays at their main offices. "We're not endorsing anything, 
but we do want to be inclusive," said John M. Morris, Citibank's media 
relations director. 
</P>
<P>
 USA: Muslim's Day has no basis in Islamic theology or culture. Rather, said 
Mohammad T. Mehdi, secretary general of the National Council on Islamic 
Affairs, it is an unabashed attempt to gain acceptance for American Muslims, 
while giving their children an Islamic alternative to Christian Christmas, 
Jewish Hanukkah and African-American Kwanzaa. 
</P>
<P>
 "American Muslims, like previous immigrants, are now demanding our share of 
the equal rights enjoyed by others. If there is a Christmas tree and a Hanukkah 
menorah in a display, why not the crescent and star?" asked Mehdi, referring to 
the symbols of Islam. "Remove them all or, in an open society like America, 
include everyone's symbol." 
</P>
<P>
 Mehdi said Muslim groups in various U.S. cities will celebrate USA: Muslim's 
Day with parties for young people, at which presents will be distributed, the 
Koran will be read and Muslim stories will be told. 
</P>
<P>
 Mehdi admitted that -- just as with some Christians and Jews -- not all 
Muslims are happy about a public display of a symbol of their faith. Some 
object on church-state separation grounds, while others are uncomfortable with 
a crescent and star appearing next to a Christian cross or Jewish star. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he predicted that within a decade, USA: Muslim's Day will be widely 
celebrated within the steadily growing American Muslim community and will be 
familiar to the nation's non-Muslims as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whoever heard of Kwanzaa until recently?" he said. "Public displays of 
menorahs are a new thing. So it will be with the crescent and star and USA: 
Muslim's Day."

3 TEEN-AGERS SUSPECTED OF ROBBING CLASSMATES; CRIME: CANYON HIGH STUDENTS ARE 
IN CUSTODY AFTER ALLEGED VICTIMS REPORT BEING BULLIED INTO TURNING OVER MONEY 
AND CANDY.

<P>
 Three teen-agers with suspected gang affiliations are in custody on suspicion 
of robbing and trying to extort money from classmates at Canyon High School, 
authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The juveniles have confronted students on campus during the past month, said 
Deputy Tony Miano of the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station, forcibly 
taking money and candy on several occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 Miano said three students have reported being victimized since authorities 
learned of the thefts earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have information that there are other victims out there, but that is 
unconfirmed," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two suspected members of one gang, ages 14 and 15, and a 17-year-old student 
believed to be an "associate" of another gang were arrested Wednesday, Miano 
said. Their names were not released because they are juveniles. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual robberies and threats occur on campus occasionally, but this was a 
unique situation, said Canyon High Principal Michael Allmandinger, who has 
presided over various Santa Clarita schools for the past 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen one that has been involved with a group organized in this 
manner, that is going out to make a business out of it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects took small amounts of money from their alleged victims in 
confrontations often witnessed by other students, Miano said, and also demanded 
much larger sums be paid in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 A 14-year-old student, for example, had $3 stolen from him in early December 
by two of the suspects, who then threatened to kill him if he didn't give them 
$500, Miano said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the suspects then "punched him out," although the student was not 
seriously injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The student was initially fearful about reporting the incident, but he and his 
family eventually agreed to tell school officials, Miano said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once it was learned that someone was finally stepping forward, other kids 
came forward and said similar things happened to them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One student reported he had about $35 to $40 and some candy taken from him by 
force during the past month, Miano said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies learned about the confrontations from school officials, 
Miano said. He declined to state how deputies learned the identities of the 
suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Miano said he believes the risk of retaliation by the suspects is low and he 
hopes other students who have been victimized will come forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been our experience that retaliation occurs far less than the general 
public believes," he said. "We're real confident that the kids arrested are 
more concerned with the outcomes of their cases than retaliation on the 
victims." 
</P>
<P>
 The juveniles arrested have confessed, Miano said. They are at Sylmar Juvenile 
Hall, facing charges of strong-arm robbery, attempted extortion, witness 
intimidation and petty theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Allmandinger said the students could also face expulsion from school.

ORANGE COUNTY NOT ALONE IN MONEY WOES, DEVALUED BONDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Walworth County, a southeastern Wisconsin region of dairy farms, lakes and 
subdivisions, has as much to do with upscale Orange County as Cheddar cheese 
has to do with Ferraris. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two share one thing: They both have seen the value of their investment 
funds drop dramatically as a result of risky bets on mortgage-backed derivative 
securities. 
</P>
<P>
 And like Orange County -- whose bond ratings have plunged as a result of its 
financial straits and resultant bankruptcy filing -- tiny Walworth County's own 
double-A bond rating was placed under review for possible downgrade Friday by 
Moody's Investors Service. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a pattern that is disturbing to bond analysts, who see a growing number 
of municipalities reaping the whirlwind after sowing the seeds of risk by 
borrowing too heavily, investing in dicey securities, or both. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports of investment losses have appeared around the country since Orange 
County's debacle became known last week, affecting communities in Texas, 
Florida, Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Illinois, Wyoming, West Virginia and 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Even where there has been no significant drop in value, nervous Wall Street 
brokers are keeping a close eye on some funds. Salomon Bros. -- Orange County's 
new financial adviser -- on Friday issued a $300,000 call for additional 
collateral from San Bernardino County after the value of securities in the 
county's $2.4-billion investment pool dipped by $150,000, said Dick Larsen, 
assistant treasurer and tax collector.  
</P>
<P>
 About a third of the San Bernardino County fund consists of money borrowed 
through reverse repurchase agreements, the same type of loan that accelerated 
Orange County's woes. 
</P>
<P>
 Government agencies also appear to be edgy about their money. Municipalities 
pulled $326 million out of the state of Texas's investment pool Friday after a 
story in the Wall Street Journal drew unflattering analogies between it and 
Orange County's fund. At the end of the day, the fund -- called TexPool -- was 
down to about $3.3 billion. TexPool invests money on behalf of more than 1,350 
school districts, municipalities and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials held a news conference to dispute the story, arguing that TexPool is 
not leveraged like Orange County, and -- as of Friday -- had no investments in 
derivatives, said Steve Garven, a spokesman for the Texas State Treasury in 
Austin. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, credit rating services, which have come under critical fire for 
underestimating the exposure of Orange County and other communities, have 
quietly begun to re-evaluate the credit-worthiness of various municipalities 
around the country, while publicly downplaying the danger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out of the 50,000 issuers across the country, we think it is a fairly 
isolated event," said Michael Dorfsman, spokesman for Standard & Poor's. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we are in the process of doing a scan." 
</P>
<P>
 While observers say Orange County stands out both for the magnitude of its 
losses and the degree of its borrowing, other local government officials were 
insufficiently wary of high-risk investments. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County's case is extreme, because of the borrowing it did to build the 
size of its portfolio. But in fact, any municipality that invested in any kind 
of long-term instrument is suffering at least a paper loss now, and will suffer 
an actual loss if it needs cash," said bond expert Joe Mysak in Friday's 
edition of Grant's Municipal Bond Observer. 
</P>
<P>
 Walworth County, with 75,000 people, pales in size compared with Orange 
County. But that's not to minimize the financial trauma to the idyllic 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting with $13.3 million in general-fund money, the county invested heavily 
in mortgage-backed derivatives, said county corporation counsel William 
Weiland. 
</P>
<P>
 As interest rates climbed this year, it saw the value of its holdings decline 
dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the securities were sold in the spring and summer, resulting in an 
$820,000 loss. The value of the remaining fund plunged to about $8 million, 
Moody's estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Moody's placed the county's double-A rating under review for 
possible downgrade. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials are investigating how the loss occurred, but say they have 
sufficient funds to meet payrolls and finance normal operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's unusual is that (the fund) comprises such a large portion of their 
general fund," said Arlene Bohner, a Moody's senior analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears virtually all of their general fund balance is tied up with these 
securities." 
</P>
<P>
 Farther south, the Odessa Junior College District in Texas had a pool of cash 
that eventually reached $25 million, including the college's operating fund. 
</P>
<P>
 With virtually no oversight of its investment policies, the one-campus 
district invested completely in long-term, mortgage-backed derivatives, said 
Sharon Cobb, a Texas state auditor. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last two years, as the value of the holdings sank, the college sold 
some of the securities at a $3-million loss, part of which was offset by 
interest income. 
</P>
<P>
 But by this month, the value of the fund had fallen to around $8 million. And 
Moody's has downgraded the district's bonds to Baa from A. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuyahoga County, Ohio, had different problems. Though Cleveland's county did 
not invest in derivatives, it did borrow money to invest. An investment pool of 
$1.1 billion was boosted to $1.8 billion with borrowed money. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the county invested in long-term securities -- and got caught 
short when the bond market fell. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid a run on the investment pool by jittery participants, the county sold 
most of the securities in October and November, incurring $114 million in 
losses. It paid back the principal and interest to about 80 pool participants, 
including county municipalities. 
</P>
<P>
 The county will absorb the loss, and is left with an investment pool valued at 
$258 million. 
</P>
<P>

 Municipalities around the country are adding up their losses as a result of 
too much borrowing, investment in risky securities, or both. A sampling: 
</P>
<P>
 * Walworth County, Wisc.: Starting with $13.3 million in general fund money, 
the county invested heavily in mortgage-backed derivatives. As interest rates 
climbed this year, it saw the value of its holdings decline dramatically. Some 
of the securities were sold in the spring and summer, at an $820,000 loss. The 
value of the remaining fund plunged to about $8 million. On Friday, Moody's 
Investors Service placed the county's "AA" rating under review for possible 
downgrading. The county is investigating how the loss occurred, but says it has 
sufficient funds to meet payrolls and to finance normal operations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Odessa Junior College District, Odessa, Tex.: The college had a pool of cash 
that eventually amounted to $25 million, including the college's operating 
fund. With virtually no supervision of its investment policies, the one-campus 
district invested all in long-term, mortgage-backed derivatives. In 1993 and 
1994, as the value of the holdings sank, the college sold some of the 
securities at a $3-million loss that was offset somewhat by interest income. By 
December, the value of the fund had fallen to around $8 million. The college 
intends to hang on to the securities, raise tuition, cut programs and take out 
bank loans to meet expenses. In the meantime, the district's financial adviser 
has resigned and college officials have been subpoenaed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cuyahoga County, Ohio.: An investment pool of $1.1 billion was boosted to 
$1.8 billion with borrowed money and invested in bonds, but not in derivatives. 
Nevertheless, as yields rose and prices fell, the value of the county's 
investments dropped. In October and November, the county sold most of the 
securities -- at a loss of $114 million -- to meet its cash needs and pay about 
80 pool participants back their principal and interest. The county will absorb 
the loss and is left with an investment pool valued at $258 million. In 
response, the county is asking its departments to cut their budgets by 11% in 
1995.

OFF THE TICKER: ENGLISH BREWING OVER TEA DISPUTE 
</P>

<BYLINE>

By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This time, it's the British who are steamed about the tea. 
</P>
<P>
 A company from Middlesex, England, has filed a lawsuit against Lipton over the 
rights to round tea bags. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 37-page lawsuit, there is no reference to Boston or a tea party or 
taxation without representation. But there is a lot of talk about trademark 
infringement and unfair competition. 
</P>
<P>
 J. Lyons & Co. and its U.S. unit, Tetley, say Thomas J. Lipton Inc., an 
Englewood Cliffs, N.J.-based company, copied its design for a round tea bag it 
began selling in the United States in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 John Young, a lawyer for Lipton, said the company would fight the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the British company cannot claim "rights to a very common geographic 
shape."

RECOVERY MILEPOST; MALL SYMBOLIZES QUAKE'S FORCE AS WELL AS PARTIAL COMEBACK OF 
NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICE APODACA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is no Santa at the Center Court of the Northridge Fashion Center this 
holiday season, and no carolers stroll the darkened main corridors. But it's 
not the ghost of Christmas past that haunts this mall -- it is last January's 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 For Northridge residents, the mall has symbolized the earthquake's terrible 
force. The temblor crumpled pillars, knocked down ceilings and moved whole 
walls inside the structure. And today, the mostly empty mall just a half mile 
from the quake's epicenter stands as a sad reminder of the rebuilding that 
remains to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it is also a milepost on the community's journey back. 
</P>
<P>
 The shopping mall's two biggest retailers, Sears and the Broadway, managed to 
reopen last month with showcase replacement stores, just in time for the 
all-important holiday buying season. And so far, shoppers have had little 
trouble finding their way back: sales are brisk. 
</P>
<P>
 For the retailing industry, of course, 'tis the season for 40% of its annual 
sales. For people, it's a time to look back and ahead. These mundane and 
profound facts are converging at the cavernous Northridge mall, whose future is 
tied to the community's. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long year," said Alice DuBois of Granada Hills as she shopped the 
Broadway for Christmas gifts. "Maybe this Christmas season will give people a 
little extra spirit, and something else to think about -- just the thought that 
we all survived it and were determined to survive it." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent weekday, the new Sears and Broadway were busy with holiday 
shoppers, many of whom said they'd been preoccupied with earthquake repairs and 
hadn't done much shopping lately. Others said they had been traveling to 
shopping centers in Woodland Hills, Glendale and Thousand Oaks, and were now 
pleased to have their old mall -- a small part of it anyway -- back in 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a wonderland, with all the lights," said DuBois. "I've been waiting 
a long time. I kept riding by and saying, 'When is it going to open, when is it 
going to open?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, most of the wonderland is off-limits. The two department stores are 
isolated at opposite ends of the sprawling mall, and everything else is closed 
-- the lengthy connecting corridors of shops sealed off. To get from Sears to 
the Broadway, most shoppers drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The mall's partial recovery mirrors the Northridge area itself, where 
residents are still grappling with their own repairs. New piles of earthquake 
rubble appear daily by the curbs. Many homeowners are only now starting their 
rebuilding jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, several Sears shoppers recently were buying hardware supplies for home 
repair work, not Christmas presents. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the temblor, the Northridge center was one of the Los Angeles area's 
largest and most successful shopping malls. But in the intervening months, 
other malls in the region that reopened sooner have benefited at its expense. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the San Fernando Valley, fully operating shopping centers are reporting 
sales increases of 10% to 30% over a year ago, and some mall retailers say 
sales are so brisk that year-to-date totals have already surpassed last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Northridge merchants won't automatically recapture those customers, nor 
will the heavy spending -- driven in part by an infusion of federal assistance 
and quake insurance funds -- necessarily continue. Nor is a mostly empty mall 
much of a lure. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, executives at Sears and Broadway are betting that the stores will 
quickly re-establish themselves as community fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
 Sears, which spent $8 million on rebuilding after the earthquake, has turned 
the Northridge store into a model for new design and merchandising concepts 
that are being implemented throughout the nationwide chain, said general 
manager Ed Tiritilli. 
</P>
<P>
 The store, now one of the largest in the Sears chain, has also beefed up its 
staff to about 400 workers, 70 more than before the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's beautiful," said Marise Moore as she and her husband, Jack, strolled 
through the remodeled Sears. They were shopping for Christmas gifts as well as 
light switches and other items for the quake repairs they'd only recently begun 
at their Granada Hills home. 
</P>
<P>
 Over at the Broadway, customers toting bright red holiday bags whisked through 
the store. Like Sears, the Broadway boasts that its rebuilt Northridge store 
shows off its new design and merchandising strategy along with its sleek 
facade. 
</P>
<P>
 But the world's best remodeling job may not be enough to win over some 
earthquake survivors. The quake's most searing images include those of 
collapsing stores and parking garages. At Northridge, a janitor -- one of few 
people at work during the early-morning temblor -- was severely injured by one 
of two demolished parking decks. 
</P>
<P>
 A Christmas shopper who didn't want her name used said her recent trip to 
Broadway was her first to any department store since the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a little nervous," she confessed.

TWO CONTRACTORS WIN RULING ON A-12 PROJECT; DEFENSE: MCDONNELL DOUGLAS AND 
GENERAL DYNAMICS COULD RECEIVE $2.4 BILLION. JUDGE FINDS PROGRAM IMPROPERLY 
CANCELED. 
</P>

<P>
 In a surprise decision that could cost the U.S. government $2.4 billion, a 
federal judge ruled late Friday that the Pentagon erred in 1991 when it 
canceled the A-12 attack jet contract under unfavorable terms with McDonnell 
Douglas and General Dynamics. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, which could result in the largest judgment won by any contractor 
against the government, may have major political repercussions -- owing both to 
its size in a tight budget environment and the two firms' allegations that the 
Pentagon deliberately destroyed crucial documents in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Claims Court Judge Robert H. Hodges' ruling means the Pentagon now could 
pay about $2 billion for the firm's development costs on the attack jet and 
perhaps $400 million for legal costs. The government had been demanding $1.5 
billion in repayments from the two firms. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent hearings on evidence and future trial dates, Hodges had given no 
warning that he was about to issue a ruling, and the order Friday left Navy 
officials stunned. "We are vigorously pursuing our remedies," a Navy spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, McDonnell Douglas spokesman Jim Reed said: "We are obviously very 
pleased with Judge Hodges' order." 
</P>
<P>
 The government could appeal the decision, opening the possibility of further 
legal battles or even a negotiated settlement. Until now, however, the Navy has 
been reluctant to settle the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The A-12, a heavy attack bomber, was to replace the aging A-6 Intruder on 
aircraft carriers. It would have been the Navy's first stealth-type aircraft, 
and its cancellation came as a blow to naval aviation. 
</P>
<P>
 The case developed into one of the largest and most acrimonious legal disputes 
in defense industry history. It involved about 60 full-time attorneys working 
for the two firms and the Justice Department. Several million pages of 
documents had been subpoenaed. 
</P>
<P>
 In a hearing Thursday, the two firms had said the Pentagon knowingly destroyed 
thousands of top-secret documents on the Air Force B-2 bomber program they had 
subpoenaed for the A-12 case. The Navy denied that either it or the Air Force 
had knowingly destroyed evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The aircraft program was as messy as the legal case.  
</P>
<P>
 The controversy erupted in late 1990, when Defense Secretary Dick Cheney fired 
several admirals who allegedly failed to disclose serious problems in the 
program. Cheney had assured Congress that it was in good shape. 
</P>
<P>
 Just several weeks later, Cheney was embarrassed by the disclosure that the 
A-12 program was between $2 billion and $9 billion over budget. Cheney canceled 
the program in January, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy issued a termination order charging that the two contractors were 
behind schedule developing the jet, and that the aircraft was too heavy. 
</P>
<P>
 Under complex contract regulations, the Navy issued a "default termination," 
meaning the contractors would be forced to repay the government about $1.5 
billion of the money they had received to develop the plane. The hurried legal 
document was actually a slightly rewritten version of the cancellation order 
for the Lockheed P-7A program. 
</P>
<P>
 The two firms filed suit a short time later, charging the government erred in 
its default termination and seeking to convert the termination to favorable 
terms -- known as "for convenience of the government." 
</P>
<P>
 Hodges ruled Friday that the Navy had not intended to default the contractors 
before Cheney decided to end the program, and had done so only after the 
Defense Department withdrew the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Testimony and other evidence at trial showed that the A-12 contract was not 
terminated because of contractor default," Hodges wrote. "The contract was 
terminated because the Office of Secretary of Defense withdrew support and 
funding from the A-12. Prior to that, the Navy did not believe that the 
contractor's performance justified termination for default." 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear how the Justice Department or the Pentagon would come up with 
money to pay the settlement. Byron Callan, Merrill Lynch aerospace analyst, 
said it could require a congressional appropriation.

JURY RECEIVES CASE AGAINST COLUMBIA SAVINGS' SPIEGEL; LITIGATION: HIS ATTORNEY 
EXHORTS PANEL TO END GOVERNMENT'S EIGHT-YEAR "VENDETTA" AGAINST EXECUTIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The much-shrunken federal criminal case against former Columbia Savings & Loan 
chief Thomas Spiegel went to a jury in Los Angeles Friday afternoon after his 
defense lawyer exhorted jurors to put a stop to the government's eight-year 
"vendetta" against Spiegel. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury broke for the weekend around 5 p.m. after a little over an hour of 
deliberations. It was expected to resume Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Only three charges remain from the original 55-count indictment brought 
against Spiegel in June, 1992, two years after he had been forced to resign 
from the Beverly Hills-based thrift. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine counts were dropped before trial, and the rest have been thrown out by 
U.S. District Judge Robert M. Takasugi over the course of the seven-week trial. 
</P>
<P>
 But the charges that stand are in many ways at the heart of both the 
government's case and the defense team's theory that Spiegel, 48, was a 
scapegoat for the financial excesses of the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The three charges -- all felonies -- center on Spiegel's alleged attempt in 
1986 to secretly grab for himself a lucrative investment opportunity that grew 
out of a $2-billion financial deal in which Columbia was a major investor. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia -- not Spiegel -- deserved that opportunity, Asst. U.S. Atty. Sean 
Berry said in his 50-minute closing argument. The fact that Spiegel later 
turned all the gains over to the thrift does not exonerate him from the crimes 
of defrauding Columbia, taking the investment opportunity as a bribe and lying 
about it in an official bank document, Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense lawyer Brad D. Brian, in a nearly two-hour closing argument that 
had some in the packed courtroom gallery brushing back tears, portrayed Spiegel 
as a scapegoat for incompetent federal regulators who disapproved of his 
$9-million 1986 paycheck and his brash investment style. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia, holding a huge portfolio of junk bonds in a market that had turned 
against them, was seized as insolvent in 1991 at a cost to taxpayers estimated 
at $1.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from wanting to hurt Columbia, Spiegel was "totally devoted" to the 
thrift, which was half-owned by his family, Brian said. He worked seven-day 
weeks to build it into the nation's most profitable, and had $144 million of 
his own money invested in it, Brian said. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia thrived in the mid-1980s largely because of Spiegel's unconventional 
-- some say highly risky -- strategy of investing in high-yield, low-rated 
corporate bonds, called junk bonds. Less glamorous thrifts stuck with safer but 
low-yielding U.S. government securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the junk bonds Columbia bought were issued in takeover deals like 
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts' $2-billion leveraged buyout of Storer Communications, 
which was financed by Michael Milken's department at Drexel Burnham Lambert. 
</P>
<P>
 Columbia invested $86 million in that 1985 deal. Prosecutors say that, as both 
a reward to Spiegel for being a good customer and an inducement for him to 
involve the thrift in more deals, Milken personally phoned Spiegel early in 
1986 and offered him a chance at a side deal in a partnership that was buying 
warrants to purchase Storer stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegel's investment of about $130,000 of his own money eventually blossomed 
into $7 million. Berry said Spiegel didn't tell Columbia about the deal until 
he was confronted two years later by Kenneth Heitz, Columbia's general counsel. 
Only then did he agree to turn the money over to the thrift, Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian said that Spiegel and other Columbia officers made many such personal 
investments in deals where Columbia also had an interest. In the Storer case, 
Spiegel felt the deal was meant for him rather than the thrift and there was no 
need to report it, Brian said. He also noted that Columbia did not accelerate 
its investing in Drexel deals after the Storer offer but rather sought ways to 
slow it.

PENTAGON CANCELS NORTHROP STEALTH MISSILE PROGRAM; DEFENSE: THE CUT WILL 
ELIMINATE 1,700 JOBS. BEHIND SCHEDULE, THE CONTRACTOR HAS LOST $622 MILLION ON 
THE PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Pentagon cinched its belt another notch tighter Friday, canceling Northrop 
Grumman's $13.3-billion program to build an advanced stealth missile. The 
program employs 1,700 workers in Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop officials said the Pentagon had not yet disclosed the specific terms 
of the cancellation Friday, leaving the firm unable to say how quickly the 
1,700 jobs might be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
 The job cutbacks will be in addition to 8,650 Northrop jobs previously slated 
to be cut in 1995, a cutback forced by the winding down of the massive B-2 
bomber program in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 Cancellation of the new missile program is an especially tough blow to 
Southern California's aerospace industry, which is losing plenty of older, 
spent programs like the B-2 and must retain the few new programs like the 
Northrop missile that have staying power. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop was behind schedule in the missile program and has lost $622 million 
on its fixed-price contract to develop the weapon, formally known as the 
tri-service standoff attack missile. 
</P>
<P>
 As its problems deepened, the estimated cost of the program rose and led the 
Pentagon to cut back its planned purchases -- actions which drove the cost of 
each missile higher and higher. The projected cost for each missile has 
increased many times over, Deputy Defense Secretary John Deutch said. 
</P>
<P>
 The weapon was intended to be a "silver bullet" carried by the firm's B-2 
stealth bomber, but Deutch said the missile had become "too expensive a silver 
bullet." 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force officials said they were caught unaware of the cancellation, which 
was made by Defense Secretary William Perry. Securities analysts said they 
believed the cancellation would be made under terms favorable to Northrop, 
though an Air Force spokeswoman said punitive terms were a possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Northrop spokesman Tony Cantafio said the missile "was technically a very 
demanding program but we made significant progress. There were no technical 
show stoppers we know of." 
</P>
<P>
 Cantafio added, "We are disappointed with this announcement and the impact it 
will have on the 1,700 Northrop Grumman employees working on the program." 
</P>
<P>
 Byron Callan, Merrill Lynch aerospace analyst, called the termination a "mixed 
blessing" for Northrop shareholders, since it will end short-term losses that 
the company has been posting. Callan said he had discounted any long-term 
earnings benefit from the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The cancellation is just the latest program that has slipped through 
Northrop's fingers following earlier losses of the Tacit Rainbow missile, the 
Air Force's new stealth jet fighter and a Navy attack jet. 
</P>
<P>
 At one time, the firm had four major stealth weapons programs, but now has 
only the B-2 bomber that is in its declining phase. And the loss of the 
tri-service missile guts Northrop missile business, which began in the 1950s 
with development of the nation's first cruise missile. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Pentagon, in disclosing the results of a six-month review of 
major programs Friday, spared every other big ticket weapon. A number of 
programs were dealt relatively minor cuts, however.  
</P>
<P>
 Lockheed's F-22 jet fighter program in Georgia took a $200-million funding 
cut, the Bell Helicopters/Boeing V-22 a $100-million cut and the Litton 
Industries destroyer program a $1.5-billion cut. * RELATED STORY: A35

 U.S. stocks closed mixed on Friday after Thursday's big selloff, as the 
Treasury bond market stabilized and municipal bond prices continued to recover 
from Orange County fallout. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts warned that a slew of economic statistics due next week could 
rile markets anew. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some foreign markets slumped badly in the wake of Wall Street's 
dive Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrials inched up 5.38 points to 3,691.11 on Friday after tumbling 
50 points on Thursday. For the week the Dow lost 54.51 points, and it now is 
6.6% below its autumn high. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broad market Friday losers still outnumbered winners by 13 to 9 on the 
NYSE and by 16 to 13 on Nasdaq, and the Russell 2,000 index of smaller stocks 
fell 0.93 point to 235.16 -- its lowest level since July, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street was still trying to gauge the potential far-reaching effects of 
Orange County's bankruptcy filing, which along with continued fears of higher 
short-term interest rates helped spark stocks' latest decline. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County investment fund debacle "makes you aware that there are 
people out there who don't know what they are doing (in markets), and by 
extension, you become less trustful of the market itself," said Trude Latimer, 
chief strategist at Ferguson, Andrews & Associates Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's selloff looked like it would continue Friday, as the Dow fell 28 
points early in the day. But computerized buy programs pulled the market up in 
the afternoon. Trading remained heavy at 336 million shares on the NYSE. 
</P>
<P>
 A stable Treasury bond market helped stocks. Yields closed mostly unchanged; 
the 30-year T-bond yield slipped to 7.85% from 7.87% on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal bonds, which sank in value on Wednesday amid worries that Orange 
County's disaster could repeat elsewhere in the country, continued to edge 
higher on Friday. The share value of the Putnam California Tax-Exempt Income 
"A" bond fund, one of the largest California muni funds, inched up 1 cent on 
Friday to $7.72. It had fallen 13 cents Wednesday and 1 cent Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But analysts warned that the bond market was likely to be tested again next 
week, when the government reports key economic data for November, including 
inflation, retail sales and housing starts. Signs of strength could put further 
upward pressure on interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, bearishness among professional investment advisers has 
reached levels not seen since March, 1982. While extreme bearishness can 
presage a rally, Wall Streeters also note that the bears sometimes are right -- 
meaning that the market can go lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Technology stocks led the rebound, after a bullish report on November 
semiconductor orders. Motorola gained 1 1/2 to 55 1/4, Texas Instruments rose 1 
3/8 to 72, Hewlett-Packard jumped 2 1/2 to 95 1/8, IBM rose 1 3/8 to 71 1/2 and 
Computer Associates was up 1 to 44 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street's bearishness spilled into some foreign markets. Hong Kong's Hang 
Seng index plummeted 279.24 points, or 3.5%, to 7,789.07, a new 1994 low. 
Mexico City's Bolsa index fell 32.11 points to 2,467.79. 
</P>
<P>
 In London the FTSE-100 index slumped 36.5 points to 2,977.3 while Frankfurt's 
DAX index was off 13.88 points to 2,028.33. In Tokyo the Nikkei-225 dropped 
201.74 points to 18,978.30.

REINSTATE BAN IN DELTA CASE, AGENCY ASKS 
</P>

<P>
 The U.S. Office of Thrift Supervision, frustrated with its own court-like 
proceedings and thwarted by a federal appeals court panel, sought a hearing 
Friday in a case involving the former president of a failed Westminster savings 
and loan. 
</P>
<P>
 The OTS wants the full U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals to reinstate the 
agency's order that had banned Young Il Kim, who ran Delta Savings Bank, from 
the financial industry for life. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency, in issuing its order in April, 1993, had ignored findings by its 
own administrative law judge that it did not have sufficient evidence to ban 
Kim for alleged misconduct at the thrift, which regulators seized three years 
ago. Kim appealed the agency's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-judge appeals court panel sided with the judge and threw out the ban 
two weeks ago, ruling unanimously that Kim's conduct "in no way" approached the 
level of culpability required by federal law to impose such sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 In asking for a hearing by the appellate judges, OTS argued in court papers 
that the panel's opinion "misapprehends the statute's culpability requirement" 
and "overlooks material facts." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim, a certified public accountant, could not be reached for comment.

</P>
<P>
 * Drug stocks also rose. Pfizer added 1 to 75 1/4, Warner-Lambert gained 1 1/4 
to 75 1/4, Merck added 1/2 to 37 1/4 and Amgen rose 5/8 to 54 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Airlines, which had led the week's market decline on earnings concerns, were 
mixed. AMR, parent of American Airlines, added 1 1/8 to 49 7/8 and Delta gained 
3/4 to 47, but Continental Airlines' B shares eased 1/4 to 8 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, railroad stocks came under pressure after brokerage Morgan Stanley 
downgraded six of them to hold from buy. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street's bearishness spilled into some foreign markets. Hong Kong's Hang 
Seng index plummeted 279.24 points, or 3.5%, to 7,789.07, a new 1994 low. 
Singapore's Straits Times index dove 37.40 points to 2,102.28 and Mexico City's 
Bolsa index fell 32.11 points to 2,467.79. 
</P>
<P>
 In London the FTSE-100 index slumped 36.5 points to 2,977.3 while Frankfurt's 
DAX index was off 13.88 points to 2,028.33. In Tokyo the Nikkei-225 dropped

BLUE CROSS FOUNDATION PROPOSAL WINS SUPPORT; HEALTH CARE: THE $2 BILLION WILL 
COMPENSATE THE PUBLIC FOR CHANGE TO FOR-PROFIT FROM NONPROFIT.

 With more than $2 billion worth of charitable health care funding at stake, 
numerous community groups and health care organizations gathered Friday to tell 
state regulators that they largely support a new foundation proposed by Blue 
Cross of California to distribute millions to health care programs for the 
needy. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodland Hills-based Blue Cross announced the proposal in September at the 
urging of Department of Corporations Commissioner Gary Mendoza in order to 
compensate the public for Blue Cross having changed most of its business from a 
nonprofit organization to a for-profit one. State law requires nonprofit health 
insurers to donate to charity the value of any assets converted into for-profit 
businesses in exchange for the tax breaks previously granted. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's meeting was designed to gather public opinion on the proposal, 
Mendoza said, before the department approves the specifics of how the proposed 
California Health Care Foundation will be structured. 
</P>
<P>
 Breast cancer survivor Elizabeth "Betsy" Mullen urged the department to 
quickly approve the proposal for the foundation. Money from the foundation is 
needed to support breast cancer treatment programs for women who cannot afford 
to pay their medical bills, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot afford to tie up the treatment dollars any more," Mullen said. "Put 
politics and special interests aside, and get this money to people who need 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Williams, president and chief executive of Childrens Hospital of Los 
Angeles, said a $1-million contribution from Blue Cross last year helped keep 
the hospital's general pediatric clinic open longer hours to relieve crowding 
of its emergency rooms. The clinic needs continued contributions from the 
foundation to provide better service to about 200,000 children the hospital 
treats every year, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation, according to Blue Cross Senior Vice President Pat Garner, 
would receive more than $2 billion from Blue Cross assets to establish itself 
as the fifth-largest charitable foundation in the country. The establishment of 
the foundation was triggered when Blue Cross' created the for-profit Wellpoint 
Health Network, Inc. to operate most of its health care insurance programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics of the plan urged the panel to provide safeguards to ensure that 
the foundation does not funnel contributions to Wellpoint and that the board of 
directors include more members of minority groups. Blue Cross said the board's 
membership is already one-third minority, including blacks, Asians and Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 While supporters of the Blue Cross plan urged quick state approval in order 
that the foundation might begin granting funds to needy health care programs, 
Mendoza declined to indicate when he would make a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our most important priority is getting it right," he said.

 In a move that completes its plans for ending the operations of the I. Magnin 
retail chain, Federated Department Stores said Friday it will convert the I. 
Magnin in Palos Verdes to a Bullock's store and sell seven remaining Magnin 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The phaseout of the 118-year-old I. Magnin chain was announced Nov. 18 by its 
parent, R. H. Macy & Co.Macy will merge later this month with Federated, which 
will control the disposition of the 12-store Magnin chain. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palos Verdes store will be the fifth Magnin to be converted to Macy or 
Bullock's outlets, which remain part of the Federated group. The others are in 
Palm Desert, Woodland Hills, Palo Alto and Walnut Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 The Magnin sites to be sold are in Beverly Hills, Newport Beach, Pasadena, San 
Diego, Carmel, Phoenix and the original San Francisco headquarters. A catalogue 
warehouse in Oakland will also be sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Federated said it decided to convert the Magnin in the Shops at Palos Verdes 
mall after completing negotiations with a developer. It will reopen as a 
Bullock's by Feb. 25. GEORGE WHITE

 China Repeats Ultimatum for GATT-WTO Entry: China, brushing aside U.S. and 
European objections, reiterated its demand to be admitted to the new World 
Trade Organization by year's end, with the rights of a developing country."The 
Chinese government has made an important decision to set the deadline of Dec. 
31, 1994, to complete the substantive stage of China's GATT-WTO negotiation," 
Deputy Foreign Trade Minister Long Yongtu said in a speech to delegates of the 
124 member nations in GATT. Long rejected charges from the United States and 
European Union that his delegation had not been flexible enough in the latest 
round of the 8-year-old negotiations. Long headed a delegation to weeklong 
private meetings in Geneva.

 Viacom, Blockbuster Cancel Entertainment, Sports Complex: Viacom and its 
recently acquired Blockbuster Entertainment unit canceled plans for the 
$1.4-billion complex in south Florida, which had been personally championed by 
Blockbuster Chairman Wayne Huizenga and dubbed "Wayne's World" by locals.Among 
the reasons the company cited for not going ahead with the five-year project: 
the significant management and financial resources required to finish it and 
the "uncertainty" involved in the regulatory process. Video rental giant 
Blockbuster announced in April it would build the 2,500-acre "Blockbuster

GENISCO TECHNOLOGY STOCK SHOOTS UP 120% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Genisco Technology Corp. common stock nearly quadrupled in value this week on 
word that a major cash infusion is in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares of the Anaheim-based company, which makes customized computer systems 
for the military, closed Friday at $4.125, up $3.25 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the gain came Friday in American Stock Exchange trading, with the 
stock rising $2.50 a share -- a 120% increase for the day -- apparently buoyed 
by a management change announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Genisco, which is selling a money-losing electronics division and 
manufacturing plant with 45 employees in Mexico, had said previously that a 
private investment firm has agreed to buy $5.4 million of its debt and convert 
it to common stock. The firm will end up owning 91% of Genisco's common shares 
but has said it does not intend to take the company private. 
</P>
<P>
 Genisco also has announced plans to raise $5 million through a private 
placement of stock. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Genisco said that Phillip C. Friedman, longtime chairman and 
largest shareholder, had resigned as part of the pending deal. He was succeeded 
as chairman by Harmon Handy, a high-technology industry entrepreneur, and as 
president and chief executive by Jerome J. Gross, who had been Genisco's vice 
president and general manager of its largest unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Trading heated up Friday, in the wake of that announcement, with about 10% of 
the company's 804,988 shares of common stock changing hands. 
</P>
<P>
 No Wall Street analysts follow the company because its stock has been so 
thinly traded and the price so low in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Genisco Controller Thomas W. Kane said Friday, however, the stock price 
appears to have soared on investor anticipation that the pending cash infusions 
will benefit the company in its efforts to expand through acquisition of other 
computer-related businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 For its latest fiscal year, Genisco reported a loss of $4.7 million on sales 
of $12.7 million. For the current year, Kane said, it will take a loss of 
$520,000 on the sale of its electronics division. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale of that unit, scheduled to be completed next week, will cut Genisco's 
employment to 65 people, all at its Anaheim headquarters, which also is home to 
its Solaris military computer system division. 
</P>
<P>
 Kane said the company is looking for acquisitions that will move it out of the 
military arena. Federal defense spending cuts, which have devastated many 
companies dependent on military supply contracts, are expected to continue at 
least through 1995, he said.

STUDENTS GET THE PICTURE; A 'NEW GENERATION' TAKES A FRESH LOOK AT L.A. 
LANDMARKS -- AND THEY'RE ANYTHING BUT TRADITIONAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 One thing struck Abbey Fuchs, 18, as she viewed the collection of photographs 
included in "Picture L.A.: Landmarks of a New Generation," an exhibition of 
photographs by Los Angeles youths, ages 10-18, at Los Angeles City Hall's 
Bridge Gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no pictures of the Hollywood sign -- probably the most famous 
landmark in Los Angeles," observed Fuchs, a freshman communications major at 
Sonoma State University who grew up in Los Angeles and attended Fairfax High. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuchs was among eight area students chosen to shoot photographs for "Picture 
L.A.," organized by the Getty Conservation Institute. The photographs, plus 
essays, have also been put together in a book with the same title by Getty 
Trust Publications, available in area bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
 A landmark, Fuchs said, is "really anything that you want it to be. It's not 
about somebody saying: 'This is a landmark, you should go take pictures of it 
because it was built by someone's great-grandfather.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope adults realize that children are people under the age of 21, who do 
have their own sense of what is happening to them," Fuchs added. "And I hope 
people will stop and take a look at everything around them, rather than driving 
by it." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The sites chosen by the young photographers -- who were sent out with 
point-and-shoot cameras loaded with black-and-white film -- were anything but 
traditional. Hardly an assortment of stony edifices, monuments and plaques, 
their "landmarks" included such moving targets as basketball players, homeless 
camps, Venice roller skaters and lots of cars -- from a simple shot of a 
glistening bumper or commuters on the freeway to a trash-filled hulk in 
graffiti-plastered Belmont tunnel and an eerie burned-out Jeep in Las Flores 
Canyon after 1993's Malibu fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Getty Conservation Institute director Miguel Angel Corzo said that the 
institute had undertaken a traditional study of Los Angeles area landmarks but 
that "I had read the reports and had sat in on the meetings, but I felt we were 
getting answers we already knew," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Los Angeles has different landmarks than, say, Boston -- the 
history is very different.' I was trying to figure out how we could really get 
a lay person's voice and which were the most important voices -- and I felt 
they were really the young people," Corzo added. 
</P>
<P>
 Corzo enlisted photographer Lauren Greenfield, 28, who grew up in Venice and 
attended Santa Monica's Crossroads School, to select a group of young people to 
take a fresh view of their surroundings (Greenfield is working on her own book 
on growing up in Los Angeles). Through schools, arts organizations and 
community groups, she selected students representing diverse communities 
including South-Central, Hollywood, Koreatown, Boyle Heights, Watts and 
Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Shooting took place from October, 1993, through the beginning of January; then 
the photographers were sent out again to document the new "landmarks" created 
by the Jan. 17 earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Hernandez, 11, a Boyle Heights sixth-grader, was fascinated by the 
Chateau Marmont Hotel; during a group field trip there, he photographed a 
Sunset Boulevard billboard featuring two people locked in a passionate kiss, 
half-hidden by lush foliage. "I liked it because it made a scene like only the 
movies capture," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez also asked Greenfield to take him to Malibu after the 1993 fires. "I 
felt sorry for the people," he said. "The first place that we went to, there 
was a lady standing there, looking at her house -- it was all burnt down, 
nothing left. She was standing there, looking down, and I took her picture. 
Also there we saw this little kid, riding on a (toy) tractor, all happy because 
he didn't have to go to school." 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Herrera, now a 19-year-old photography major at Los Angeles City College, 
focused on a homeless community in Belmont Tunnel. "I mostly took pictures of 
the homeless because we have to do something about the homeless," he said. "Not 
just take care of them but guide them in a certain way so they can get out of 
the streets again." 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera also wanted to highlight the urban beauty of the tunnel. "There are 
two types of graffiti. What they do on the buses is vandalism; what they do in 
the tunnel is art ," he said. "Even the homeless tell me without the graffiti, 
life would be a little more boring." 
</P>
<P>
 Osofu Washington of Inglewood, 17, a Crenshaw High student, chose back-yard 
basketball games and a local barbershop as his landmarks. "Before the project, 
I thought a landmark was something that you wrote on the ground, like 'Jim was 
here' -- something that you made ," he said, laughing. "This gave me a whole 
different perspective. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people think of (my neighborhood) as the inner city, a real bad 
place to be," Washington continued. "Maybe this will give them a sense of 
what's positive about the neighborhood. And people who are already here might 
see something across the street and say, 'Hey, that's a landmark!' -- and get a 
sense of pride."

 True, comics are having a field day with the recent GOP surge, but Orange 
County comedy fans probably are going to be left out of the punch lines. Which 
is pretty much business as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 Comedians who venture into Orange County, it seems, tend to check their 
political humor at the county line. Especially the elephant jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not bringing it up," said Robert Hartman, a regional Improv manager 
based in Brea, referring to Jesse Helms, Newt Gingrich and other members of 
Washington's new Republican majority. "I thought they'd be all over that, but I 
guess they've learned to just leave it alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Hartman reasons that's a result of past performances. Over the years, he has 
seen comics stranded on stage after making political references that just died 
in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (comedians) want to come back, they have to entertain and make the 
audience laugh," Hartman continued. "It's not their job to educate and 
enlighten, as opposed to a place like San Francisco, where you need a viewpoint 
to do well. That's opposite of what works down here." 
</P>
<P>
 At the county's other major comedy venue, Nicole Odekirk -- general manager of 
the Irvine Improv, which draws heavily from Irvine, Newport Beach and Costa 
Mesa -- notices much the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This club is already so conservative, most comics will stay away from 
political stuff," she said. "And if they make a comment, it's just one or two 
and then they'll move on. I don't think it'll affect this club. Most comics are 
very liberal and shy away from it. Jack Coen gets away with it here because 
he's so good and does both sides of it. Most political comics just don't go 
over here at all." 
</P>
<P>
 From the performers' side, local funnyman Jerry Mabbott sees much the same 
adherence to the status quo but believes there is a little room for political 
potshots if a comic has done his homework. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see a big difference since the takeover," he said. "I just got back 
from Texas, and there's a huge difference there. Everybody is nailing the 
Republicans left and right. I was real happy about it. I don't do a lot of 
political stuff in Orange County, but some targets are OK, like Dan Quayle. But 
you can't hit Bush too hard. Or Reagan. . . . You can hit Nancy Reagan, but not 
Barbara Bush -- she's the Quaker Oats guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Mabbott also notices a geographical factor in the political humor equation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The farther south you go, the more likely they are to respond with coolness 
at a hard hit to a Republican. Clinton you can do all you want. In the 
Brea-Fullerton area, there's much more of a mix. It's easier to get laughs. But 
if you have an audience that's 90% hard Republican, the other 10% are afraid to 
laugh."

WRITING DUO ADDS SPICE TO TELEVISION'S WHITE-BREAD DIET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH HANANIA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They spoofingly call themselves Rice and Beans, this senior writing team for 
the NBC sitcom "Empty Nest."  
</P>
<P>
 The "rice" is Chinese American Vince Cheung, 38; the "beans," Mexican American 
Ben Montanio, 35. 
</P>
<P>
 And with less than 4% of all network writers belonging to racial and ethnic 
minorities, the duo may be TV's only mixed minority team, according to Zara 
Taylor, executive administrator for employment diversity at the Writers Guild. 
</P>
<P>
 That uniqueness doesn't exactly make Cheung and Montanio comfortable. Cheung 
remembers all too well growing up in L.A. with the nickname "Odd Job." Montanio 
still remembers his shock the day in school he realized that a cartoonish 
Mexican character he had always laughed at on the show "Quick Draw McGraw" was 
taken by his classmates to be an accurate representation of himself. 
</P>
<P>
 They met in 1988 at ITC Productions, where Cheung was a development executive 
and Montanio oversaw the nuts and bolts of production. Thrown together to do 
script rewrites, they discovered they liked it and quit their jobs to pursue 
writing full time. They worked on "Growing Pains," "Night Court" and "Roc" 
before joining "Empty Nest" last June. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the title of supervising producers, however, they remain two notches 
below where the real power resides on most series -- the executive producer. 
</P>
<P>
 "If minority writers created shows (which got on the air), TV would look 
different," Montanio says. "The change would be subtle. But it would be 
noticeable. But if you're just a writer on staff, your power is limited. You 
don't have much say in the way the show will be shaped or the themes explored." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the casual viewer would be hard-pressed to guess that "Empty Nest" is 
supervised by minority writers. With the exception of one black cast member, 
the show's ensemble -- who were all in place before Cheung and Montanio came 
aboard -- is white. And even though the series is based in Miami, which has a 
huge Latino population, Latino culture merely seeps in around the edges of 
"Empty Nest." 
</P>
<P>
 They do what they can -- Montanio recently substituted a Latino man on 
crutches for the stereotypical Latina woman with five children, for example -- 
but for the most part they are unhappy with television's portrayal of 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 What Montanio wants to do is write about "everyday (Latinos) who hold down 
honest jobs, the ones who work at the bank, the ones who work at the post 
office . . . Television needs to reinforce (viewers') respect for Latinos, 
instead of giving such a narrow opinion of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Cheung concurs that stereotypes are still pervasive. Asian American males, he 
says, are too often portrayed as "kung-fu fighters, engineers or computer 
nerds," and too rarely as, say, romantic leads. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm embarrassed by what I see on TV," Cheung says. "TV tells me that if I'm 
not sitting behind a computer terminal or if I'm not a cook, I don't exist. But 
I do exist. TV just won't reflect that." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, although insisting that a writer's biggest strength comes from writing 
what he knows, Montanio finds that he routinely must ignore his own first-hand 
experiences. What he knows is that the moment he leaves the studio lot, he may 
be mistaken for an illegal alien, that despite holding a highly prized job in a 
competitive industry and speaking flawless English, he is still often treated 
as a second-class citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 What he knows, too, is that writers hired after him have risen higher and 
gotten richer. "In the years we've been writing, we have no hard evidence that 
discrimination is a factor. But we're never sure what the executives are saying 
behind closed doors," Montanio said. 
</P>
<P>
 (According to the Writers Guild, from 1987 to 1991 -- the last period for 
which such figures were compiled -- minority writers earned $10,000 a year less 
than their white male counterparts.) 
</P>
<P>
 Montanio suspects that this de facto anti-minority message has been heard. 
Although he has been flooded with "an ocean" of scripts by would-be television 
writers, he has seen less than 10 scripts from Latinos in five years. The 
number of scripts Cheung has seen from Asian Americans is only slightly higher. 
</P>
<P>
 They are heartened, however, by the arrival on ABC this season of 
"All-American Girl," a comedy about a Korean American family. Cheung thinks it 
still reflects a mainstream view of a minority culture, but he is glad it's on 
and credits that accomplishment in part to Ken Mok, an Asian American executive 
at ABC whom he says helped shepherd it through the network development maze. 
</P>
<P>
 Montanio says he doesn't know of any Latino Ken Mok-types at the networks. 
But, he argues, "it's the responsibility of the top network programming 
executives, the people who buy the shows, to familiarize themselves with the 
Latino community. And if they aren't willing to do it, they should hire someone 
who will." 
</P>
<P>
 Montanio and Cheung hope that the country's changing demographics will make TV 
executives more receptive to minority-themed shows. It's a point the pair 
stress to them when pitching ideas for such programming: that the Latino and 
Asian American populations are growing, that they watch a lot of television and 
that they have purchasing power that should appeal to advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We watch TV. We're your viewers. You need to include us, too," Montanio says. 
</P>
<P>
 "And we have to realize this and empower ourselves," he adds of the minority 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's not complain that TV doesn't reflect us. We need to tell each other 
that we can do this, that we can write, we can produce, that we can create."

A NEW REGIME IN POWER, NEW FODDER FOR COMEDY

 President Clinton promised thousands of new jobs, but I don't think he meant 
for the Republicans. -- David Brenner 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After the historic shift of power wrought by last month's midterm elections, 
the Democrats are dethroned, the Republicans are ascendant and the court 
jesters can't wait to get to work. 
</P>
<P>
 As Newt Gingrich, Bob Dole, Jesse Helms and the rest of the triumphant 
conservatives happily garb themselves in the mantle of newfound federal power, 
it's also a lively time for those who relish pointing out that the emperors are 
naked. The country's turn to the right has spin doctors spinning and pundits 
pondering, but the keenest analyses may well come from sharp-shooting political 
comics. 
</P>
<P>
 Jabs at the President's junk food intake had grown tired, but with fresh 
Republican targets at hand and a revitalized comedic purpose taken to heart, 
the future is looking very funny to the nation's voices of satiric opposition.  
</P>
<P>
 "Newt's a great character," says Harry Shearer, creator of public radio's 
pointedly satirical "Le Show." "I don't think I ever did any Tom Foley material 
during his tenure, but Newt's going to be very generous in providing us with 
stuff to do. It's not a matter of giving him enough rope -- he's taking it. 
He's basically gone and built a rope factory."  
</P>
<P>
 "I think the elections are going to change the mood and material of every 
comedian," says Bill Maher, host of Comedy Central's "Politically Incorrect." 
"And in general I'd say that when you have conservatives in power, it's better 
for comedy, because they make the kind of authority figures that you want to 
stick a pin in. Democrats have trouble being authority figures of any kind. As 
a comedian, when I go into a voting booth, there are often divided feelings -- 
I can vote my conscience or my career."  
</P>
<P>
 Some comics make no secret of the fact that their personal politics lean 
leftward, so powerful figures from the right make for the juiciest prey. 
Stand-up Will Durst is looking forward to the moment when Gingrich and Dole 
stumble, or when the Contract With America is breached.  
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to sound like a carrion-eater, but the worse things are for the 
country, the better they are for me. It was hard for me to work against the 
hopeful mood after the Clinton election, because my humor comes out of anger 
and frustration. I've got much better focus now with Newt and Jesse Helms 
around. And fortunately, as a liberal, I'm protected by the Endangered Species 
Act."  
</P>
<P>
 Richard Belzer isn't sure the laughs are always worth the aggravation. "I'd 
rather have a boring country with no humor than the kind of mess where the 
politicians are writing the jokes for us. Ronald Reagan wrote my material for 
eight years, and I wasn't so fond of the '80s."  
</P>
<P>
 Belzer will soon be taking a break from his role on NBC's "Homicide: Life on 
the Street" to return to some stand-up work and he's not sure exactly how he'll 
make light of the current political climate. "Ironically, it's a humorless 
situation. It would be easy to say things are hopeless, but my job is to find 
the humor and give relief to the audience. I want them to think, but they have 
to laugh. I actually think it will be a little harder to be funny now, because 
the targets are almost too easy and the people are so disgusted with the 
process. Political humor's going to be redefined over the next year, but I'm 
not sure in what direction."  
</P>
<P>
 Paula Poundstone feels that her humor's direction will be dictated by the 
folks in Washington -- once she gets past her own post-election blues. "It's 
hard to tell whether comedy will get any better. I tend to just plain get 
depressed. I haven't come up with any terribly clever lines or insightful bits 
yet. I'm still in the name-calling phase. But I think without the assistance of 
any comics, the new batch of politicians are quite capable of shooting 
themselves in the foot.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be easy to come up with humor based on these people's points of 
view, their substance," she says. "I don't take issue with what they look like 
or who they run around with. I don't care who they sleep with. They could sleep 
with anybody as far as I'm concerned. In fact, I think I'd actually encourage 
that. It might soften them up."  
</P>
<P>
 Much has been made of this political season's mean-spirited tone, and 
impressionist Jim Morris says he's ready to wield some mean-spirited comedy in 
response. He's built a career on uncanny and savage evocations of Presidents 
Reagan, Bush and Clinton, and is preparing to take on D.C.'s new fraternity of 
power-brokers with equal gusto.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't worry about tempering the humor. I thought I was being cruel and 
vicious when I did Reagan and Bush. When Barbara Bush invited me to the White 
House and told me that my George was funny without being cruel, I was a little 
insulted. If I'm not being cruel, I'm not doing my job."  
</P>
<P>
 It may take Morris a little longer than usual to work up a properly vicious 
take on Gingrich. "I need to watch a character over and over in order to really 
get them down, and, to tell you the truth, there's only so much I can take of 
Newt Gingrich." 
</P>
<P>
 Not every comedian is working himself into a political frenzy. David Brenner 
takes a few jabs at the Beltway, but feels more inclined to keep his material 
away from issues of state. "I don't think my purpose is to pretend that I have 
inside information and to persuade people to my point of view," he explains. 
"There's enough poison seeping through the country. I think humor should help 
to dissolve some of those poisons."  
</P>
<P>
 But stand-up Suzanne Westenhoefer is finding that more and more audiences are 
responding enthusiastically to political material. "Between e-mail and CNN, 
people are more informed," she says. "Political stuff used to only go over in 
the major cities, but now people in diners across the country are talking about 
GATT. I can do a Bob Dole joke in the hinterlands and have it go over big. Two 
years ago that couldn't happen. It's probably not my responsibility to take on 
Bob Dole, but I certainly do enjoy it."  
</P>
<P>
 The prime targets and cherished laugh lines may be in transition, but for Rick 
Overton, the mission remains the same. "I've been the voice of opposition long 
before Newt showed up, and I'm still here -- like Papillon on a sack of 
coconuts. I don't have a choice."  
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody's always in power," Shearer says. "Somebody's always abusing it and 
somebody's always screwing up. It doesn't make any difference to me if it's 
Jesse Jackson or Jesse Helms. Neither side has a monopoly on stupidity, 
venality or pomposity. Just give me a Jesse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have faith in the American political system, and my faith is that it will 
continue to provide political humorists with everything we need."

MARIACHIS NO LONGER SECOND-STRINGERS; MUSIC: LOS CAMPEROS DE NATI CANO WILL 
TAKE CENTER STAGE AT THIS YEAR'S SOLD-OUT FIESTA NAVIDAD IN COSTA MESA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTHANNE SALIDO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As an art form, mariachi music has long been relegated to the back of the bar 
or the corner of a wedding reception. But that is starting to change. 
</P>
<P>
 "For 200 years, European music has dominated concert halls, even in Mexico," 
said Nati Cano, musical director of Mariachi Los Camperos de Nati Cano, which 
will break with tradition Sunday by taking center stage at Fiesta Navidad, a 
celebration of Mexican music and dance at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The show, sponsored by the center and the Orange County Philharmonic Society, 
is a presentation of the various celebrations of Las Posadas, a traditional 
Mexican Christmas fiesta that marks the pilgrimage of Joseph and Mary to 
Bethlehem. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year Cano and his mariachis performed as part of the Philharmonic's 
international series. Their performance was so "extraordinarily popular" that 
the society invited them back. This time, it's for a stand-alone event, 
independent of a subscription series, said Dena Montiel, marketing director of 
the Philharmonic Society. She added that the society hopes to turn Fiesta 
Navidad, which is sold-out again, into an annual event. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Cano's mariachi group, the event will feature Mariachi 
Tlaquepaque, dance troupes Ballet Folklorico Olin, Ballet Folklorico de UCLA, 
musical group Conjunto Hueyapan and roper Tony Munoz. The 40 musicians and 30 
dancers will take the audience to various regions of Mexico via their 
performances, Cano said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But make no mistake: Mariachi music will play a dominant role. And Cano, who 
is doing the musical arrangement and choreography, could not be happier. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's more to this music than 'La Bamba' and 'Cielito Lindo,' " said Cano. 
"I see this music as a serious art form. It's not just a means to make a 
living, which is fine. But I hope to show just a little more" of what mariachi 
music is about. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just like with Mexican food," Cano said. "I say, 'Do you know Mexican 
food?' and people say they do. But if I say, 'Do you know about mixiote 
(barbecued lamb wrapped in leaves) or chiles en nogada (stuffed chilies in 
walnut sauce)?' they say, 'What's that?' And I say, 'You don't know real 
Mexican food.' If you go to Mexico and ask for a burrito, they say, 'What is 
that?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Cano says that when people seek more than a superficial knowledge of mariachi 
music, they will encounter its deliciousness, its beauty and its complexity and 
be hooked for life. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to food analogies, Cano, 61, knows of which he speaks. He is 
owner of the popular La Fonda de Los Camperos Mexican restaurant in Los 
Angeles, where members of Los Camperos frequently play. 
</P>
<P>
 His knowledge of Mexican music runs even deeper. His father and grandfather 
were musicians, and Cano joined his first mariachi band when he was 14. The 
Jalisco native moved to Los Angeles in 1957 and founded his Camperos (which 
means "travelers") four years later. 
</P>
<P>
 One sign that mariachi music was finally beginning to get more respect came in 
1990, when Cano was awarded a $5,000 National Heritage Fellowship from the 
National Endowment for the Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Cano and his Camperos also were one of four mariachi ensembles that 
collaborated on Linda Ronstadt's 1987 best-selling album "Canciones de Mi 
Padre," and they also appeared on her 1991 follow-up "Mas Canciones." In 
return, Ronstadt co-produced the group's 1992 album, "Canciones de Siempre" 
(PolyGram Latino). 
</P>
<P>
 Cano, who also is a lecturer at UCLA, believes in the social responsibility of 
musicians and in the power of music. While he is happy that he and his Camperos 
will perform at the Performing Arts Center, he quickly adds that "to let 
mariachi music take center stage is a great responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 That responsibility includes educating the public in general and, in 
particular, Mexican and Mexican American youths who may be heading in the wrong 
direction with their lives, Cano said. 
</P>
<P>
 Upholding tradition, including that of mariachi music, can help the youths 
find their way. Tradition is important, he said, "not as a way of life, but it 
should be there." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "I hope the young kids will understand, through the music, that they 
should be proud of themselves. We should be proud of being here, in this 
beautiful country, but we should also be proud of where we came from, because 
it's who we are too." 
</P>
<P>
 * Fiesta Navidad will be presented Sunday at the Orange County Performing Arts 
Center, 600 Town Center Drive. Costa Mesa. 3 p.m. SOLD-OUT. Sponsored by the 
center and the Orange County Philharmonic Society. (714) 553-2422.

POP BEAT: CRASH WORSHIP KNOWS HOW TO DRIVE FANS WILD; THE CULT BAND THAT 
COMBINES THE ASSAULTING FEEL OF INDUSTRIAL DANCE MUSIC WITH THE BOOM OF THREE 
LIVE DRUMMERS HAS A FOLLOWING STRETCHING COAST TO COAST.

 With pulsing tribal drums, body paint, bonfires, sweaty dancers and unbridled 
sensuality, Crash Worship's shows are more like pagan rituals than rock 
concerts. The San Diego band is renown for whipping audiences into feverish 
frenzies -- and alienating club owners nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did a show in Denver recently where the audience was getting more and more 
into it, taking off their clothes and frantically dancing," says JXL, one of 
the band's two lead singers. "The venue ended up shutting the show down, but 
everything kept going for 15 minutes after they pulled the plug. At a certain 
point, you just get swept away." 
</P>
<P>
 Crash Worship, whose cult audience stretches from New York to L.A., combines 
the assaulting feel of industrial dance music with the boom of three live 
drummers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a combo of a band and an event," says JXL -- who goes by the initials 
of his undisclosed real name -- regarding his six-piece band, which plays 
Friday at Club Lingerie. "It's hard for me to explain because there are really 
no bands of the past to compare us to. We're not performance art, the whole 
thing is very dependent on the audience -- how spontaneously they combust."  
</P>
<P>
 To ensure crowd ignition, Crash Worship employs up to 10 additional members to 
go out in the audience and motivate fans with reaction-provoking antics -- from 
the spraying of fake blood to slipping into possessed, trancelike dances. 
</P>
<P>
 The animalistic howls, groans and wails of JXL and second vocalist Jack Tarino 
also hit a deep chord, tapping emotions that often prove spine-tingling and 
eerie. "There's really no structured lyrics," say JXL, a man of few words. 
"Most of it's like speaking in tongues. We follow rhythms." 
</P>
<P>
 Crash Worship started as a collaborative studio project of experimental 
musicians and studio nerds in 1987 and went on to release several independent 
singles and EPs on its own and other independent labels (it will put out its 
first full album next month on the Bay Area label Charnel Music). In 1989, the 
band evolved into a visceral live act. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started realizing there's certain powerful elements that break things up 
as compared to a normal show, like intense drumming, relentless beat and fire 
that drives you," JXL says. "It all has a deep effect on people in different 
ways." 
</P>
<P>
 The band is influenced as much by the tangled clamor of Australia's Birthday 
Party and the live intensity of the Stooges as by the coursing feel of ancient 
drum ensembles. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a certain amount of discipline involved in our music too," JXL says. 
"Once everything starts going, that's just the foundation. Everything else on 
top of that is chaotic, frantic energy." 
</P>
<P>
 * Crash Worship plays Friday at Club Lingerie, 6507 Sunset Blvd., 9 p.m. $8. 
(213) 466-8557.

 Phair Play: When acclaimed singer-songwriter Liz Phair appeared on the cover 
of Rolling Stone and in the pages of Vogue after the September release of her 
second album, "Whip-Smart," the grumbling in the indie rock world was that 
she's become a "media manipulator" who loves the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't sound like the Phair who's decided to postpone touring 
indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate doing some kind of 'Rock the Nation' tour," says Phair, who will play 
a short solo set tonight at KROQ's "Almost Acoustic Christmas" benefit at the 
Universal Amphitheatre. "It doesn't suit my personality. I never grew up with 
fantasies about the rock world, so I never have a desire to conquer a show. . . 
. I have much more of a folky mentality of performing. The last thing I want to 
do is go out with a band and rock." 
</P>
<P>
 The massive attention that came with the release of her second album proved 
claustrophobic for Phair. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to be the face of rock for 1994," she says. "I'd much prefer to 
see myself on a more lasting chart -- a slower ascension and longer graph. I'd 
like to stick around and last rather than 'Do it now! Break huge! Break Big!' I 
think this job is something that I just have to take in the kind of doses I can 
enjoy."

CHAGALL'S BIRTHPLACE FINALLY RETURNS HIS AFFECTION.; ART: HIS HOMETOWN OF 
VITEBSK IN BELARUS HAS A MUSEUM IN HIS HONOR, BUT NO ORIGINAL WORKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE HOCKSTADER, THE WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One day in 1962, an extraordinary letter arrived at the Vitebsk museum for 
culture and history, a pretty pink building that was left standing, 
miraculously, after the city was pulverized in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter was from a Soviet scholar in France who had been in touch with Marc 
Chagall, the renowned modernist painter then in his mid-70s. This alone was 
unusual. Chagall, who had left his home town of Vitebsk as a young man to live 
in France, was a non-person as far as Moscow was concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 As an emigre, a Jew and a painter whose work did not (to say the least) 
celebrate the heroic triumphs of the Soviet socialist people, Chagall was 
politically, ethnically and artistically incorrect. What could a Soviet scholar 
on official business possibly have to discuss with Chagall? 
</P>
<P>
 If the fact of the letter was unusual, the content was astonishing. Chagall 
left Vitebsk (pronounced VEE-tebsk) in 1922, but he had never forgotten it. It 
was where he first fell in love, married and learned to draw and paint. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Chagall's early canvases are scenes of Vitebsk or what he called its 
"special sky," where he conjured soaring brides, flying cows, dancing fiddlers 
and airborne violins, all of them taking flight in his imagination and 
lingering, as shards of memory, for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Chagall, relaying his message through the scholar, wanted to know: Could 
he give some of his work back to the city that had inspired him so many years 
ago? 
</P>
<P>
 Yevgenia Kichina, who worked in the museum's art department, saw the letter 
and got excited. With some others in her office, she drafted a letter 
describing post-war Vitebsk, a city of grimy apartment blocks that was almost 
unrecognizable as the 1,000-year-old town of wooden houses and graceful 
cathedrals of Chagall's youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "We said we had set up an art department and would be happy if we could have 
the Chagall pieces," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Kichina mentioned the letter to a member of the city's Communist Party 
committee. "He said, 'What -- and you are going to do this on your own, without 
any permission? How could this even occur to you?' " 
</P>
<P>
 She appealed to a regional party official, who turned her down flat. "I asked 
him why not, and he said, 'No, period.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The moment passed, and the opportunity vanished. Having lost much of its 
heritage in the war, Vitebsk had let slip the ties to its most famous son too. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, three decades later, the city is struggling to reclaim what it has lost. 
Most suspect that Vitebsk's bond with Chagall, who died in 1985, is 
irretrievably gone. But a few true believers are convinced it is not too late, 
that Vitebsk and Chagall can connect again, that somehow the artist and his 
legacy can rescue dull, drab Vitebsk, add a dab of life, a splash of color and 
put the town on the map, despite everything. 
</P>
<P>
 It won't be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 On a bluff high above the river that winds through Vitebsk, in the shade of a 
leafy park, stands an old, red-brick house of two stories. Formerly used for 
apartments, the building was converted two years ago and is now one of the 
world's more curious museums. It is Vitebsk's Marc Chagall Museum, but it 
contains no original works by Chagall. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially the museum is owned and operated by the city, but in truth it is 
the personal project and passion of the director, Lyubov Bazan. A reed-thin, 
37-year-old woman of determination and intelligence, Bazan has managed quite 
literally to make something out of nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Bazan grew up in Vitebsk during the pre-Gorbachev period of stagnation, when 
the name of Chagall was all but unknown here. The few mentions of his work 
Bazan had glimpsed were in the pages of Soviet art books, in which the artist 
was mocked and criticized. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only when Bazan was an art student that she discovered, while leafing 
through such a book, that Chagall was born in Vitebsk, the son of a 
Yiddish-speaking manual laborer who worked in a herring store. She was 
astonished. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started asking people, older people, about Chagall," she said. "They said 
he had emigrated a long time ago, that he was a traitor to his motherland." 
</P>
<P>
 Chagall, once the city's arts commissar, had disappeared from Vitebsk almost 
without a trace. No books of his art were available in the bookstores; no 
posters could be bought at the museums. The one or two original works he left 
behind in the city were lost in 1941, when the Germans swept into Vitebsk, 
occupying it for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The house where the artist grew up was still standing in a quiet neighborhood 
that was once the Jewish ghetto, but there was nothing to distinguish it. The 
school and museum he ran had been turned into a computer center. 
</P>
<P>
 In a country consumed by xenophobia and anti-Semitism, it was chancy even to 
speak about Chagall. This was particularly true in provincial, war-battered 
Byelorussia (renamed Belarus at independence two years ago), which was among 
the more conservative outposts of the Soviet empire. 
</P>
<P>
 Bazan, as a young museum researcher in the early 1980s, was reprimanded for 
chatting about Chagall with visitors from Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally in 1988, as the system began to crumble, thanks to Gorbachev's 
reforms, Bazan was allowed to pursue her interest in Chagall openly, and she 
began planning the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we arranged this exhibit, we faced a big problem, because we have no 
original works of art," she said. "So we were producing from our hearts, our 
souls. And we needed an imaginative way to show Chagall's work, his 
composition, his coloring, this fairy-tale quality to his art. We wanted to 
present a general mood. It was the only way out -- to show something of Chagall 
when we didn't have Chagall himself." The museum opened in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is modest but appealing. Some of Chagall's paintings with a Vitebsk 
theme have been copied right on the walls and ceilings. One of them is "Red 
Roofs," a work from the 1950s in which the artist, palette in hand, bows low to 
the city as he is presented with a bouquet of flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two lithographs, donated by a museum in Germany. Old chairs, a 
samovar, an oil lamp, a clock and a violin are suspended in mid-air, as if in 
flight. On the wall is a poem by Chagall, in his handwriting, dedicated to 
Bella, his first wife and the bride who is soaring with him above Vitebsk in 
his early paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the museum, there are a few signs of Chagall in today's Vitebsk (pop. 
380,000). On Pokrovsky Street, where Chagall grew up, a statue of the artist 
was erected in 1992. His house, too, is still there, fenced off, its 
inhabitants recently evicted, with a small plaque on the wall saying Chagall 
lived there. 
</P>
<P>
 There is talk of making it, too, into a museum -- furnished, presumably, in 
period style. But nobody knows who would pay for such a project. Bazan, the 
museum director, is paid barely $10 a month by the city. Vitebsk, like most of 
Belarus, is broke. 
</P>

WRITING THE END TO A TRUE-TO-LIFE CINDERELLA STORY; REMEMBRANCE: THE FACTS OF 
LANA TURNER'S DISCOVERY AT A SODA FOUNTAIN HAVE CHANGED THROUGH THE YEARS, BUT 
THE LEGEND REMAINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By W.R. WILKERSON III, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; W.R. Wilkerson III is a Los 
Angeles based writer / producer. His upcoming book, Billy Wilkerson: The Great 
Hollywood Discoverer, will be published next year. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once upon a time, actually it was January, 1937, Judy Turner cut her Hollywood 
High School typing class and slipped across Sunset Boulevard to share a Coke 
with some friends. 
</P>
<P>
 My father W.R. (Billy) Wilkerson, was already sipping Coke at the same soda 
fountain. He often strolled there from his nearby office at The Hollywood 
Reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years a dispute has arisen over the name of this soda fountain. Some 
remember it as Curries Ice Cream Parlor. The star herself always called it The 
Top Hat Cafe. The important fact is that it was next to Hollywood High School 
and popular as a high school hangout. 
</P>
<P>
 As the blonde 15-year-old entered the soda fountain, she caught my father's 
attention. Even decades later he would recall how "breathtakingly beautiful" 
she looked that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkerson asked the manager about the young girl. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's Judy, Mr. Wilkerson." 
</P>
<P>
 My father wanted to meet her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll ask," said the manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The manager, who knew both of them well, went over to Judy. "That gentleman 
over there would like to meet you." 
</P>
<P>
 "You can imagine what ran through my mind," Lana told me in a 1974 interview. 
</P>
<P>
 She asked the manager, "Why?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It's OK. He's a gentleman, Judy. He owns The Hollywood Reporter just down 
Sunset." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, if you say so. But stay close." 
</P>
<P>
 An introduction was made. 
</P>
<P>
 My father produced his business card and asked the schoolgirl if she would 
like to be in pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy seemed confused and unsure. "I'll have to ask my mother," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, young Judy visited the publisher's office with her mother in 
tow. They had decided to take Wilkerson up on his offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Seated in my father's office, Judy exuded the same natural beauty and charm he 
had noticed in the soda fountain. There was also an innocence and, not the 
least, a burgeoning sensuality which, he knew, lights and camera would eagerly 
enhance. Judy was magic, he would say in later years. "There was something 
about her that was special. She had a quality all her own that was 
unforgettable." 
</P>
<P>
 My father penned a note to agent Zeppo Marx. Marx signed Judy Turner to his 
agency and the rest is, as they say, is history. 
</P>
<P>
 My father's hunch was confirmed by the rest of Hollywood. Judy Turner, renamed 
Lana, was a born star. 
</P>
<P>
 On that January day, a Hollywood myth sprang to life. In one brief, glittering 
moment, a schoolgirl was plucked from a soda fountain counter and catapulted 
into the eternal firmament of stardom. 
</P>
<P>
 But curiously, while Hollywood's history is littered with dozens of noteworthy 
discovery stories, this one stuck. Lana's much quoted "discovery" became one of 
the town's most enduring legends. It became famous as "The Hollywood Cinderella 
Story" because it combined a young girl, Cinderella; a powerful publisher, the 
handsome prince; and a letter to agent Zeppo Marx, the glass slipper that 
transformed her life. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Top Hat's owner placed a metal plaque on the seat Lana had occupied on the 
magical morning of her discovery. Soon, his soda fountain was swarming with 
girls eager to meet the mysterious man who had discovered Lana Turner. My 
father had to stop visiting The Top Hat. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next three years, The Top Hat became a highly profitable business. In 
1940, having tripled his business, its owner sold up and retired to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 His good fortune had not gone unnoticed by Leon Schwab, who owned Schwab's 
Pharmacy two miles west of Hollywood High. No matter that Lana would had to 
have been a track star to sprint to Schwab's, inhale a Coke and make it back 
for her next class. Leon sold sodas and Schwab's was, like The Top Hat, located 
on Sunset Boulevard. He started claiming that Lana had been sitting at his 
counter when she was discovered, not by Wilkerson, but by her first director, 
Mervyn LeRoy. Since The Top Hat no longer existed, few bothered to dispute 
Leon's claim. 
</P>
<P>
 The myth that Lana was discovered at Schwab's was augmented by Hollywood 
columnist Sidney Skolsky. As Lana writes, Skolsky was having lunch at the 
counter when "a busty blonde came up and asked which stool was Lana Turner's. 
Skolsky simply picked one and pointed it out." 
</P>
<P>
 The blonde sat down and Schwab's became a Hollywood landmark, Mecca to 
thousands of tourists and would-be stars. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should own stock in Schwab's," Lana told me jokingly in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Amid a lifetime of accomplishments, discovering Judy was always one of my 
father's fondest memories. She was, however, by no means the only person he 
guided to good fortune. The magic dust from his wings settled on many, 
including Clark Gable, Judy Garland, Jackie Gleason, Phil Silvers, famed 
director Joe Pasternak and mega-film producer Cubby Broccoli. 
</P>
<P>
 But no other Hollywood discovery has captured the collective imagination as 
much as Lana's. It has fed and perpetuated the rich fantasy that Hollywood is, 
after all, Dreamland. 
</P>
<P>
 No screen writer could have written it better. Lana was just minding her own 
business having a Coke when destiny called. Her discovery became proof that 
Hollywood was a place of mystery and magic where a schoolgirl can become a 
screen legend. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1974, Lana told me about her enduring gratitude toward my father. Of 
course, it didn't hurt that all through her early years, The Reporter regularly 
covered Lana's career. In 1948, she personally demonstrated that gratitude by 
asking Wilkerson to be best man at her third wedding (to Bob Topping). 
Flattered, my father offered his house for the ceremony, and the couple 
delightfully accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 She recalled her discovery with gushy tenderness. "Other people over the years 
have been attributed with saying those lines. But it was your father who said 
them which I think is even more enchanting because it was your father who did 
find me, even though Mervyn LeRoy gave me my chance. God knows where I'd have 
been if I hadn't been at that time and place where your father saw me." 
</P>
<P>
 Lana's passing brings down the final curtain on Hollywood's Golden Era. The 
Sweater Girl's fairy tale story began with a discovery which made Hollywood 
history almost overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 She will always remain that innocent and sensual celluloid spirit, a perfect 
Cinderella frozen in time, preserved forever for us, her grateful audience.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; $11.4 BILLION IN COLLATERAL SOLD BY BROKERAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BYTOM PETRUNO and JODI WILGOREN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County officials disclosed Friday that investment firms have sold $11.4 
billion in bonds they held as collateral on loans to the county, deepening the 
county's financial crisis as a swarm of investigators stepped up inquiries into 
the debacle. 
</P>
<P>
 Those sales -- made in spite of the county's bankruptcy filing -- mean its 
investment fund has lost hundreds of millions of dollars it may never recover, 
financial analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst of all possible things has happened," said Zane B. Mann, publisher 
of the California Municipal Bond Advisor newsletter. "The money is frozen in 
the pool, and the assets that secure the pool have been cut in half." 
</P>
<P>
 Ernie Schneider, the county's administrative officer, said even the county 
does not know how severe a blow Wall Street firms have dealt the investment 
pool, which includes investments from 185 cities, school districts and other 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 One bright spot -- however meager -- is that even though the fund is frozen, 
its cash holdings have improved as some county-held securities matured this 
week, he said. The pool, which had $350 million in cash when bankruptcy was 
declared, has $500 million or more in cash now. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We're expecting to deal with this situation by ourselves," Schneider said. 
"Orange County has always lived within its means. Always." 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Friday: 
</P>
<P>
 * County officials acknowledged that the Board of Supervisors had authorized 
former Treasurer Robert L. Citron to invest in so-called reverse repurchase 
agreements, loans that allowed him to balloon the fund's size almost threefold. 
Supervisors approved the practice in 1985 and have not revisited the issue 
since. 
</P>
<P>
 * Citron, 69, who resigned Sunday, hired an attorney, former federal 
prosecutor David Weichert, a criminal and civil litigator who represented one 
of the executives in Charles H. Keating Jr.'s financial empire. 
</P>
<P>
 * The county district attorney's office said it would expand its inquiry into 
the crisis to include allegations that Citron may have accepted improper gifts 
from financial investors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Willie Brown, the Assembly's Democratic leader, said he was seriously 
considering calling a special session of the lower house Dec. 20 to deal with 
the Orange County fiscal disaster. Brown, the Assembly's presiding officer in 
the wake of a deadlock over the speakership, said other lawmakers are urging 
him to send a reassuring signal to Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a solution, but I think the banking world would love to see some 
action by respected elected types in Sacramento that they are at least trying 
to solve the problem," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gov. Pete Wilson said he will send a team from the state Department of 
Finance to Orange County to help former state Treasurer Thomas Hayes, the 
county's new financial adviser. Wilson said he believes Orange County's crisis 
stems from problems with an individual -- Citron -- not the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said the state might advance money to Orange County to assist with cash 
flow, but has no authority to guarantee future loans to help it build back its 
finances. 
</P>
<P>
 * County officials filed a lawsuit against Nomura Securities Co., a brokerage 
that seized and sold $900 million worth of the county's bond holdings this 
week. Officials promised further action against the Wall Street firms that sold 
a total of $11.4 billion in bonds they held as collateral on loans the county 
took to boost what has proved an ill-considered bet on falling interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 * Merrill Lynch, a key county financier, is under investigation by both the 
Securities and Exchange Commission and the National Assn. of Securities Dealers 
for its financial dealings with the county, which Tuesday became the largest 
municipality in U.S. history to file for bankruptcy protection. Both Merrill 
Lynch and another brokerage, Rauscher Pierce Refsnes, were subpoenaed by the 
SEC. 
</P>
<P>
 * Paychecks went out on time to 28,000 school bus drivers, cafeteria workers 
and secretaries throughout the county, as promised. The local teachers credit 
union offered emergency loans to members if paychecks are delayed because of 
the crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 * The financial catastrophe prompted Laguna Beach school officials to halt 
plans to renovate classrooms at Thurston Middle School that were destroyed by 
last fall's firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
 Most city officials in the county said they expect to be able to make 
payrolls, pay vendors and cover routine expenses for the immediate future. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's going to be tight as hell," La Habra City Manager Lee Risner said. 
"If anything serious goes wrong or a disaster occurs during the year, then God 
have mercy on our soul." 
</P>
<P>
 An advisory committee of six city managers announced two priorities: gaining 
control of their share of tax money as it is paid to the county and trying to 
separate city money in the investment fund from what is being considered 
"county assets." 
</P>
<P>
 Raising the stakes in their battle with the county, Wall Street brokerages 
confirmed Friday that they collectively are hanging onto $100 million to $200 
million due the county on their sales this week of the $11.4 billion in 
county-owned securities. The $100 million to $200 million represents excess 
collateral the firms held on the county's loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The brokerages apparently are refusing to forward the cash to the county 
because of the lawsuit filed Friday in federal bankruptcy court in Santa Ana 
against Nomura Securities, alleging that the seizure and sale of the securities 
was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges that the brokerage violated an "automatic stay" imposed by 
the bankruptcy filing when it sold the county's securities on Wall Street this 
week. Bruce Bennett, the county's bankruptcy lawyer, asks that Nomura be held 
in contempt of court and forced to replace the $900 million in securities plus 
compensatory and punitive damages and legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett and Schneider said other suits are likely to follow next week. "We 
will go after every single one of (the investment bankers selling collateral)," 
Schneider said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Nomura declared that the suit was "baseless and without 
merit," and said it would defend itself "vigorously." Lawyers for Nomura and 
the other brokerages say the collateral sales were proper under a legal 
exemption from the stay. 
</P>
<P>
 The securities sold were held as collateral for loans the brokerages had made 
to the county, as part of its strategy of leveraging its bet on bonds. When the 
county missed payments on some of the loans, the brokerages said they began 
exercising their right to sell the collateral and close out the loans -- a 
process that triggered the county's bankruptcy filing Tuesday and that 
continued in the days after. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett said he believes the county will ultimately get that money back. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most important questions -- exactly what is left in the county 
fund, after this week's forced sale of the $11.4 billion in collateral -- 
remains the subject of speculation because the county will not provide figures. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett said newly appointed financial consultants from the New York 
investment bank Salomon Bros. were trying to determine the current value of the 
portfolio. They have "been instructed to prepare comprehensive reports as soon 
as is humanly possible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming the county was on target last week in estimating that the fund had a 
current market value of $18.5 billion, the $11.4 billion in securities sales 
this week by brokerages would have reduced the fund to about $7.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 That total could be further reduced by $2.1 billion in loans still outstanding 
to Merrill Lynch and Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette Securities -- meaning the fund 
could contain bonds worth just $5 billion, or 36% less than the $7.8 billion 
the county has said its investors put in. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the county said the net loss on the portfolio was about $1.5 
billion, or about 20% of investors' capital. And some Wall Street executives 
said Friday that the value of the remaining securities could be significantly 
greater than $5 billion, meaning that the county's $1.5-billion loss estimate 
may still be in the ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the county details the portfolio, however, the extent of the fund's 
losses won't be known. 
</P>
<P>
 Others saw more losses coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Peer Swan, chairman of the Irvine Ranch Water District, an investor in the 
portfolio, predicted that the fund's losses could total $2 billion to $3 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Making the situation even worse, some say, is the fact that the $11.4 billion 
that has been sold included the county's most solid securities, while the 
holdings that are left are shakier. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann of the California Municipal Bond Advisor said it was impossible for 
outsiders to speculate on the exact value of what remains in the pool because 
the county has not released the exact design of the portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until this winds down, and I'm thinking several days or weeks, the local 
communities are not going to have any idea what they're going to salvage from 
this," Mann said. "Some day the whole thing is going to be unwrapped and people 
are going to be paid. What's completely obscure right now is: Is that going to 
be 50 cents on the dollar? Or 5 cents?" 
</P>
<P>
 Mann also pointed out that legal fees and administrative costs often eat up 
large chunks of the resources in bankruptcy cases. County officials have 
refused to provide estimates of how much is currently being spent on extra 
personnel to solve the crisis, except to say that their lead bankruptcy 
attorney is paid $375 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, two class-action lawsuits were filed on behalf of investors 
holding Orange County bonds. Lawyers indicated more are on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 One was filed on behalf of Leetate Smith, a retired insurance executive in 
Rancho Santa Fe, and another on behalf of a woman named Janice Morgenstern. 
</P>
<P>
 They both name former county treasurer Citron, his then-assistant Matthew R. 
Raabe, county Auditor Steven E. Lewis and Merrill Lynch, which underwrote much 
of Citron's bond trading, as defendants. The county itself is not named as a 
defendant, attorney Edward M. Gergosian said, because it has the shelter of 
bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC's inquiry into the county's dealings escalated with the delivery of 
subpoenas to Merrill Lynch and Rauscher Pierce Refsnes. Both investment houses 
were involved in a multimillion-dollar Orange County bond deal that has spurred 
questions about whether disclosure laws were followed. The firms denied any 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 SEC officials, in a statement Friday, said that they cannot set investment 
policy for municipalities, but that the commission does have "authority and 
responsibility" to regulate dealers and "eliminate corrupt practices." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, sources said the National Assn. of Securities Dealers has 
opened an investigation into $3,000 in contributions from three Merrill Lynch 
employees to Citron during the treasurer's hotly contested reelection campaign 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office said Friday that it was expanding its review of 
the imbroglio to include an inquiry into whether Citron violated restrictions 
on such gifts that went into effect last year. Citron received more than $400 
in gifts from 14 investment firms active in the county's retirement fund.  
</P>
<P>
 "Bob has had an exemplary record of public service for over 20 years," 
Citron's new attorney, Weichert, said late Friday. "There is no fathomable 
reason why such a distinguished public servant would knowingly jeopardize the 
financial soundness of the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators asked to talk Friday with Raabe, now the county's acting 
treasurer, but he declined to speak with them until he had consulted an 
attorney.  
</P>
<P>
 Friday was a low-profile day for top county officials, including newly 
appointed financial adviser Hayes, who declined requests for interviews and 
spent hours behind the closed door of a fifth-floor Hall of Administration 
conference room being guarded by a sheriff's deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials shuttled in and out of the so-called "war room" that was set 
up at the county's administrative headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Sternberg, who is acting as spokeswoman for the county during the 
crisis, said the Board of Supervisors canceled its scheduled Friday meeting and 
a press conference because the supervisors are too busy in marathon briefings 
behind closed doors with their financial advisers and lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're trying to get the team together," Sternberg said. "They're working 
the weekend, to take a look at this thing, come back fresh on Monday and answer 
some questions. It's just disruptive," she said of media inquiries. "These 
people are working. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron's absence from the building was being felt in many ways. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one person who knew everything (about the investment fund) is not here 
anymore," Sternberg said. "We need to have all the pieces of the problem before 
we can put this thing together. This is probably the first long, hard look at 
the county's financial situation that's been done in 20 years."  
</P>
<P>
 At 6:50 a.m., Hayes was behind a desk with the receiver to his ear and a cup 
of coffee in his hand, trying to calm the financial markets in New York and 
help restructure the county's ever-growing debt. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's raised my comfort level a great deal," Board of Supervisors Chairman 
Thomas F. Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the day, Hayes met with bankruptcy attorneys, county supervisors 
and other high-level county officials, including the county's chief 
administrator, auditor and district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One floor under Hayes' war room, a team of lawyers discussed legal strategies. 
At noon, half a dozen attorneys, who had flown into the county, went directly 
to the Hall of Administration with briefcases and luggage in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, problems similar to those sinking Orange County's finances were 
emerging for risk-taking municipalities around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports of investment losses have appeared around the country since Orange 
County's debacle became known, affecting communities in Texas, Florida, 
Kentucky, Maine, Maryland, Illinois, Wyoming, West Virginia and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Moody's Investors Service put the bond rating of Walworth County, 
Wis., under review for possible downgrade after the value of its investments 
plunged. 
</P>
<P>
 Even where there has been no significant drop in value, nervous Wall Street 
brokers are keeping a close eye on some funds -- such as that of San Bernardino 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Salomon Bros. on Friday issued a $300,000 call for additional collateral to 
that county after the value of securities in its $2.4-billion investment pool 
dipped by $150,000, said Assistant Treasurer-Tax Collector Dick Larsen. About a 
third of that fund is borrowed money, using reverse repurchase agreements, a 
type of loan. 
</P>
<P>
 And investors appear to be edgy about their money as well. A story in Friday's 
Wall Street Journal, drawing analogies between Orange County and the investment 
pool for the state of Texas, spurred a mini-run on the pool, with investors 
pulling $326 million out in one day, leaving about $3.3 billion. The fund, 
called TexPool, invests money on behalf of more than 1,350 school districts, 
municipalities and others.

 As Orange County ended its first week in bankruptcy:

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; BROKERAGE URGED MORE AUTHORITY FOR COUNTY 
TREASURERS; BANKRUPTCY: LEGISLATURE, BACKED BY ORANGE COUNTY LAWMAKERS AND 
MERRILL LYNCH, STEADILY GAVE LOCAL OFFICIALS ADDED LEEWAY TO PUT TAX MONEY INTO 
COMPLEX INVESTMENTS.

<P>
 Merrill Lynch, the Wall Street firm most closely tied to Orange County's 
failed investment strategy, was a driving force in the state Legislature on at 
least five bills approved since 1987 that widened counties' authority to put 
local tax money into more exotic investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Orange County lawmakers and spurred on by Wall Street political 
contributions, the Legislature repeatedly has expanded the fiscal authority of 
counties and steadily moved toward deregulating the investment practices of 
local treasurers. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Citron, the Orange County treasurer who quit this week as the county 
plunged into bankruptcy because of his investment schemes, pushed hard for 
passage of many of the bills. Citron then used the newfound freedom to invest 
tax money in securities offered by Merrill Lynch. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1987, Merrill Lynch has employed the law firm of Orrick, Herrington & 
Sutcliff as its Sacramento lobbyist. As a law firm, Orrick, Herrington is a 
major player in government finances and served as a bond counsel on at least 15 
Orange County bond deals since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Orrick, Herrington sponsored bills expanding counties' investment power, and 
its lead lobbyist, James Bruner, helped shepherd them through the legislative 
maze. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's there all the time, all the time," said state Sen. Quentin L. Kopp 
(I-San Francisco). He consistently pushed "two, three of those bills every 
year," Kopp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruner did not return phone calls this week and Merrill Lynch has declined 
comment beyond a statement saying that it did nothing irregular with regard to 
the Orange County fiscal situation. 
</P>
<P>
 No statute specifically permitted Citron to use tax money, as he did, to 
borrow more money, then gamble that cash based on the direction of British or 
German interest rates. But the way lawmakers wrote the codes, local treasurers 
became increasingly deregulated. 
</P>
<P>
 The deregulation came through a series of bills -- at least 16 since 1979 -- 
broadening the authority of counties and other local agencies to invest their 
cash. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature began allowing counties to enter the new world of Wall Street 
with complex investments such as reverse repurchase agreements and various 
derivatives as local treasurers demanded more freedom to make up revenue 
shortfalls after Proposition 13 passed in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Orange County lawmakers were happy to oblige because of their view that 
local government should have more autonomy and that government should be more 
businesslike. In most instances, warnings about associated risks were 
overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
 In the state Senate, many of the bills were heard in the Local Government 
Committee, of which Kopp is a member. Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) is 
the longtime chairwoman, but she is leaving the Senate next month to take 
office as an Orange County supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been skeptical," Kopp said, "and Marian let them all go through. I was a 
thorn. But on most of them, I finally relented." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson sponsored at least three bills dealing with local investment 
authority. One permitted local governments to invest in securities that were 
A-rated, rather than far-safer AAA-rated securities. The measure, which now is 
law, was sponsored by Orrick, Herrington and backed by Merrill Lynch and 
Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson characterized her legislation as "non-controversial" and said it was 
fueled by a feeling that local governments needed more tools to finance 
services in the aftermath of the tax-cutting Proposition 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been an effort throughout government to try to give greater local 
autonomy," Bergeson said. "I'm a believer in that, as long as accountability is 
established." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County lawmakers -- including former Assembly members Tom Umberg, 
Richard Robinson and Chester (Chet) Wray -- were instrumental in winning such 
law changes. They not only got plaudits from Citron, but many also received 
thousands of dollars in campaign contributions from Merrill Lynch and Orrick, 
Herrington. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1987, Merrill Lynch and Orrick, Herrington have given at least $80,000 
to the Orange County delegation in Sacramento and local Orange County 
officials. Bergeson has received $8,000 since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 All five sitting Orange County supervisors have received contributions from 
Orrick, Herrington and Merrill Lynch. Contributions also went to Orange County 
school board members, council members from various cities, and Irvine Ranch 
Water District trustees. Merrill Lynch also donated to local ballot measures to 
build an Orange County jail and to increase the sales tax to finance roads. 
</P>
<P>
 In his reelection race this year, Citron received $1,000 from Orrick, 
Herrington and $1,000 from Michael Stamenson, the Merrill Lynch broker most 
heavily involved in the firm's dealings with Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch and Orrick, Herrington long have been major donors to statewide 
candidates, including treasurer and governor, and have given to other state 
legislators. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers from outside Orange County also played a role in changing the laws 
to open up new ways for local governments to invest their money. Most of the 
bills passed easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) was one of a handful of 
Orange County lawmakers who received no campaign money from Orrick, Herrington 
or Merrill Lynch since 1987, campaign records show. 
</P>
<P>
 "The blame starts with legislators who are carrying the bills knowing 
absolutely nothing about what they were doing," said Ferguson, who is running 
for the Senate seat Bergeson is vacating. 
</P>
<P>
 Orrick, Herrington and Merrill Lynch also exercised their power by killing 
bills, as Assemblyman Byron Sher (D-Palo Alto) discovered in 1987. Sher's bill, 
backed by Citibank, proposed allowing local governments to invest in relatively 
low-risk, bank-generated securities. These securities would have offered stable 
interest rates, unlike the complex derivatives that Citron favored. 
</P>
<P>
 Stamenson, Merrill Lynch's lead broker on municipal investments in California, 
took a personal role in killing Sher's bill. Stamenson became so enraged over 
the arcane measure that he physically charged the lobbyist who was trying to 
get the bill passed, witnesses said. Stamenson ended up bloodied. Shortly 
after, Citron, who also opposed the bill, sent a scathing letter to Citibank 
taking Stamenson's side and attacking the lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Merrill didn't handle these (types of investments); banks did," Sher said 
Friday. "You can draw your own conclusion. Merrill didn't want the 
competition." 
</P>
<P>
 As the depth of Orange County's problems became apparent this week, 
legislative staffers were combing law books to determine how it was that Orange 
County was able to make such complex investments on such a huge scale. At least 
three lawmakers were preparing to introduce bills to stop such investment 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
 In the aftermath of the city of San Jose's $60-million financial debacle in 
1984, the Legislature sought to rein in local officials. Like Orange County, 
San Jose fiscal officers invested cash using reverse repurchase agreements, 
betting on the direction of interest rates to help their money grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Dominic Cortese (D-San Jose), who carried the bill, first sought 
to prevent local government from dabbling in reverse repurchase agreements. 
</P>
<P>
 "I actually lost sleep contemplating what a terrible impact this loss had on 
(San Jose) -- the number of police officers they could have hired, the number 
of parks they could have bought," Cortese said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cortese said the bill met fierce opposition from San Jose officials and 
other treasurers, as well as the brokerage industry. In the end, the bill 
required only that local treasurers make monthly reports detailing the health 
of their investment portfolios to boards of supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just beat me down with regard to this bill," Cortese said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even that provision fell by the wayside because written into the law was a 
provision that the reporting requirement would end in 1991. By 1991, the San 
Jose fiasco had become a dim memory in the Capitol, and the reporting 
requirement no longer is part of the statute. Cortese acknowledged that he 
"missed the boat" by not seeking to extend it. 
</P>
<P>
 One reporting requirement did remain on the books requiring local treasurers 
to report quarterly. But as part of three successive budgets in the 1990s, the 
Legislature removed the requirement, along with other state mandates on local 
governments. The reason: Local governments did not want to spend the money on 
such reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent expansion of local investment authority became law last year. 
Then-Assemblyman Umberg (D-Garden Grove) carried the bill, which was backed by 
Citron, Orange County and Merrill Lynch, through Orrick, Herrington. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure permits county treasurers to invest in derivatives based on 
mortgage interest rates, among others. In themselves, the securities listed by 
Umberg's measure are relatively conventional. But Citron used some of those 
investments in risky ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg said the bill "wasn't very controversial" and was assured by 
legislative committee consultants that it would be an effective tool for county 
treasurers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a bond expert," Umberg said. "I was assured these were safe 
instruments. All it did was provide them with a broader range of investments. I 
would assume county treasurers would use their own discretion in their use." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergeson said, "Hindsight is always great. I'm sure anyone could look 10 years 
back and find that in solving one problem they've created another problem." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the few people who added a cautionary note to the Umberg bill was Inyo 
County Treasurer John Tracy. In a letter to Umberg, Tracy warned that the 
investment vehicles were "unsafe and unsound." As it turned out, Tracy was the 
lone voice warning against the bill, and other county treasurers criticized him 
for trying to block them from gaining the extra authority. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, Tracy said he was hesitant to take an I-told-you-so posture, given 
the Orange County bankruptcy and the resignation of Citron, whom he counts as a 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hoped this wouldn't come up," Tracy said. "But I felt this was a danger. . 
. . It seems to me (the 1992 legislation) does have a bearing, certainly 
because for the first time it allowed us to invest in items we couldn't invest 
in before."

SHARK KILLS SANTA BARBARA SKIN DIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A shark, apparently a great white, killed a commercial diver in the waters off 
San Miguel Island on Friday -- the state's first confirmed death from a shark 
attack in nearly six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara resident James Robinson, 42, was treading water near his boat 
when the shark swooped in for a swift, brutal attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson had just finished a routine dive to scout for sea urchins and had 
deposited his equipment aboard his boat. His two crew members were putting away 
the equipment when they heard Robinson scream -- and whirled around to see him 
drifting unconscious in a gush of blood. 
</P>
<P>
 "His right leg was nearly severed, and his left leg had puncture wounds on 
it," said Francis Oliver, a diver who came to Robinson's aid after hearing his 
crew mates' distress call. "It was pretty gruesome." 
</P>
<P>
 A veteran diver, Robinson was attacked about 9:45 a.m. half a mile off the 
coast of San Miguel Island, which lies about 40 miles west of Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Crew members on Robinson's boat, the Florentia Marie, tried to revive him but 
could not find a pulse. A Coast Guard helicopter rushed Robinson to Goleta 
Valley Community Hospital, where he was pronounced dead of massive trauma at 
11:15 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither of the crew members saw the attack. But Coast Guard officials said 
they believe Robinson was targeted by a great white shark, a keen-eyed predator 
that can grow up to 20 feet long and can sink its serrated teeth through a 
surfer and surfboard with one swift bite. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say it's like a bullet . . . you never see the one that hit you," urchin 
diver Jeffery Gunning said. "I just hope it went quick for Jimmy."  
</P>
<P>
 Before entering the sea urchin business, Robinson had worked for years as a 
deep-sea diver for an offshore oil rig in the North Sea near the English 
Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 After settling in Santa Barbara, he quickly absorbed the California lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 Deeply tanned, with blond curly hair and an athletic build, Robinson loved 
surfing and diving -- any activities that would keep him in the sun or in the 
water. Gracious and vivacious, Robinson was popular both in the harbor and in 
the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always hear about the good dying young, and golly, this guy was just one 
of the best," longtime diver Steve Rebuck said. "He will really be missed."  
</P>
<P>
 Most professional divers realize that great white sharks haunt the waters 
around San Miguel Island, where they feast on seals and sea lions. But their 
lurking presence has not deterred divers from prowling the ocean floor for 
valuable sea urchins, abalone and lobsters. It is a threat most divers take in 
stride. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're frightened by it, you have no business being in the business," 
Rebuck said. "More people are killed by lightning and bee stings than by shark 
attacks." 
</P>
<P>
 Although great white sharks bump, bite and scare several people a year in 
California, fatalities are rare. 
</P>
<P>
 No deadly attacks have been confirmed since UCLA graduate student Tamara 
McCallister was killed by a great white off Malibu in February, 1989. A 
kayaker, McCallister was found dead with a 13-inch chunk of flesh torn from her 
thigh. 
</P>
<P>
 In a more recent incident, a woman's shark-bitten body was found off the San 
Diego coast last April. But the county coroner said the victim may already have 
been dead when the great white gnawed at her body. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To protect themselves from attack, veteran divers usually descend to the ocean 
floor as quickly as possible. Once on the bottom, they can hide among rocks and 
shadows. Eventually, however, they must rise to the surface, where their 
wet-suited bodies are vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the risks of diving," Gunning said. "We become part of the food 
chain when we enter the water." 
</P>
<P>
 As a precaution, several divers in Northern California have begun to tuck 
plastic pistols in their wet suits before jumping into shark-infested waters, 
Rebuck said. 
</P>
<P>
 But most locals rely on a more low-tech survival technique: when face to face 
with a great white, they "say three Hail Marys and four Our Fathers," diver 
Matt Barnes said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the waters around San Miguel Island, divers have learned to check for 
sharks by studying the behavior of the sea lions and seals that carpet the 
beaches. If the animals look spooked -- or if any appear mauled -- the divers 
know to stay away. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the best precautions, however, are not fail-safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharks sometimes attack humans out of pure curiosity, marine biologist Gary 
Davis said. And they sometimes confuse divers in wet suits for sleek seals. 
</P>
<P>
 "They spend a lot of time bumping things on the surface and seeing if anything 
falls off," Davis said. "If it does, they taste it, to see if it's something 
good to eat." 
</P>
<P>
 Divers are willing to face such risks in part because the sea urchin business 
can be quite lucrative. Divers earn $1 to $1.60 a pound for the prickly 
animals, which look like bristling pincushions. Sea urchin roe is a delicacy in 
Japan, prized for its rarity, freshness and delicate taste.

COLUMN ONE; FIGHTING TO RECLAIM BLIGHTED BUILDINGS; AS THE NUMBER OF ABANDONED 
STRUCTURES RISES, L.A. PREPARES TO WIDEN ITS WAR TO ROUST SQUATTERS AND GANGS 
AND TRACK DOWN ERRANT OWNERS.

<P>
 Abandoned by its owner and invaded by drug addicts, the snug two-bedroom house 
on Hooper Avenue had become a disgusting mess. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, walls were smeared with gang graffiti and floors were carpeted with 
trash, human excrement and the cigarette lighters that are calling cards of 
crack cocaine smokers. The arched front windows were shattered, covered with 
grungy pink bedsheets. Plumbing fixtures were gone. A homeless woman was 
running out the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 That is what building inspector John De La Bretoniere found last week before 
he posted a no-trespassing sign on the broken front door of the house in 
South-Central Los Angeles. It was his second visit in a month, and this time he 
pledged to get the house boarded up and fenced off. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Bretoniere is on the front line of the difficult struggle to combat the 
debilitating effects of abandoned buildings. It is a fight that other urban 
centers waged, and often lost, two decades ago, but only now is becoming 
crucial to the health of some Los Angeles neighborhoods and to the city's 
texture. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't do something about a situation like this, eventually it's going 
to spread to the next house," he said, "and pretty soon it could be where there 
would be no one to buy houses and no sense staying in the neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 As real estate values declined over the past two years, abandoned properties 
monitored by the city Department of Building and Safety increased 28%, to 
1,381, most of them single-family homes. The number of city-ordered demolitions 
rose to more than 120 a year. That does not include the 1,800 or so other 
buildings left vacant by the Northridge earthquake in January or the more than 
200 empty lots remaining from the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trend is up on abandonment and that is pretty evident when you drive 
around the city," said Capt. Roger Ruddick of the city Fire Prevention Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a significant rise." 
</P>
<P>
 In Hollywood, Watts, Pacoima and Westlake, the homeless often occupy these 
ghostly buildings. Fires they set to keep warm have gotten out of control more 
than 300 times this year and caused at least two deaths. Frustrated neighbors, 
still bravely tending their front lawns, worry about property values, rats and 
the likelihood of flames jumping roof to roof. 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders are seeking better ways to discourage abandonment. Perhaps even 
more difficult, they also want to prevent buildings from being taken over by 
squatters and the stripping of plumbing, wiring and even window frames by 
salvage-hungry vandals. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, the city's attention has been grabbed by gruesome examples of 
what can go wrong with abandoned buildings. Dozens of squatters were rescued 
from a fire at the boarded-up Californian Hotel in Westlake, a man was tortured 
and murdered in a decayed Hollywood apartment building, and neighbors cheered 
the demolition of a Boyle Heights house that had been commandeered by a violent 
gang. 
</P>
<P>
 A City Council committee Monday is scheduled to consider proposals that would 
replace the traditional three-quarter-inch plywood window barriers on abandoned 
buildings with steel and possibly require floodlighting; make it legally easier 
for the city to demolish unrepairable properties, and encourage nonprofit 
groups to acquire salvageable buildings for affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Also being discussed are better coordination among agencies fighting 
abandonment and a plan to create a toll-free hot line for citizen reports on 
vacant buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 But as other cities have learned, solutions are not easy and results are mixed 
amid confusing property rights, failed banks, intractable crime and limited 
budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 New York City has taken over and repaired 47,000 abandoned apartments, but is 
finding it too costly to act as landlord and wants to sell the units. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, community groups in East Oakland have made strides in 
fixing vacant houses and helping low-income families buy their first slice of 
the American Dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "The success stories are great and they are real, but they don't affect 
numbers in any meaningful way" compared to the national problem, said Mary 
Comerio, a UC Berkeley architecture professor who studies abandonment. She 
warns that Los Angeles should brace for a possible epidemic. 
</P>
<P>
 The relative youth of the housing stock in Los Angeles and the big increase in 
immigrants during a healthy economy helped the city avoid the urban wastelands 
that parts of New York, Chicago and St. Louis have become, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the late 1980s, developers had to scour to find any abandoned property 
in Los Angeles, recalled city Housing Department official Ralph R. Esparza. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city market was so strong at the time that no one in their right mind 
would walk away from their property. Now, I think that you are seeing ownership 
interest dropping, especially at properties bought for more than their current 
market value." 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, many Los Angeles housing units need more repairs than landlords 
say they can afford. Adding to the wear and tear, newer immigrant families are 
more likely to double and triple up in one house or apartment because 
decent-paying jobs are harder to find. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles is finally catching up with the rest of the country," Comerio 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Abandonment "is a hard battle to fight if the basic market forces are causing 
a shift in demand away from the neighborhood," said Tom Black, a resident 
fellow at the Urban Land Institute, a Washington think tank for developers. 
However, Black doubts that the problem in Los Angeles will become as severe as 
those in Eastern and Midwestern cities. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, no large swaths of Los Angeles are abandoned, despite pockets of 
ghost towns created by the earthquake. Although the slow pace has been 
criticized, federal grants and loans are expected to help restore or replace 
many quake-damaged buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, parts of the city are losing buildings regularly, with single-family 
homes making up about 80% of the properties abandoned, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 On the wall above inspector De La Bretoniere's desk, he keeps photos of more 
than 100 dangerously dilapidated houses for which he has arranged demolition in 
his 2 1/2 years at the building department's contract nuisance abatement 
section. His nickname around the office is "the Hammer," a friendly nod to the 
aggressiveness that twice led to him to finding corpses inside ruins. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to community complaints, he and just five colleagues try to track 
down property owners and get them to repair or properly protect vacant houses, 
hotels, factories, warehouses and stores from vandalism. Months can be wasted 
trying to locate rightful owners and follow what some council members complain 
are cumbersome rules that seemingly protect property rights more than community 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If owners cannot be found or refuse to cooperate, as often happens, the city 
hires a contractor to board up windows and doors and erect eight-foot-high 
chain-link fencing. That can cost $7,000 at a single-family house and much more 
at an apartment building or shopping center. Liens are then placed on the 
property pending its sale. The city is owed about $3 million in unpaid liens 
for boarding and demolition costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Security measures often do not keep invaders out. Then the work has to be 
repeated after the homeless and gangsters shovel, ax, saw, tunnel or climb in. 
</P>
<P>
 "If these people are bound and determined to get in, they are going to get 
in," said Richard Sanchez, a chief inspector. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, De La Bretoniere went back to a fire-scarred duplex on 114th Street 
that the owner had tried to board up. He found four dilapidated cars on the 
lawn and two young men living on the ground floor behind a barricaded door that 
they refused to open, claiming they paid rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Defusing a nasty confrontation, the inspector and a Los Angeles police officer 
warned the apparent squatters about the building's dangers and informed them 
that the property soon would be boarded up again and fenced. Demolition may be 
the next step. 
</P>
<P>
 If vandalism or fire destroys more than 60% of a building and it is a threat 
to public safety, city inspectors usually will push for demolition. Another 
lengthy search for owners must be launched in a bureaucratic process that at 
least seven council members contend is too time-consuming. 
</P>
<P>
 Demolitions are expensive and can quickly eat up the $250,000 the city sets 
aside each year for them. So officials must postpone tearing down some 
structures and ask the City Council for extra money for bigger, urgent jobs. 
Neighbors often demand such action, preferring an empty lot to a crack house. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents on otherwise well-maintained streets had complained for years about 
a vacant and partly burned factory at 62nd Street and Van Ness Avenue. They 
petitioned for bulldozers and recently won a demolition that cost the city 
$21,167.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure I'm happy," said block club President Mary Lydia. "Now when I look out 
the door I don't see all those tires, all that graffiti, all that trash. We're 
trying to keep it nice here and when you've got these abandoned buildings here, 
it's really bad." Still, she is worried that the lot may become a trash heap if 
not properly fenced soon. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Bretoniere calls it a success. "When you clean up a neighborhood, people 
feel like they are not neglected. It's very gratifying to hear a neighbor say 
thanks for a good job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council this week appropriated $160,000 for ripping down the troubled 
Californian Hotel in the Westlake district. The five-story, 200-room structure 
had been boarded up three times since July and suffered three fires before the 
devastating one Nov. 21, officials said. Fire Chief Donald O. Manning called it 
a potentially "killer building" for firefighters and the squatters. 
</P>
<P>
 A tangled, and possibly fraudulent, string of ownership slowed action at the 
hotel. Some officials suspect that the owners are pleased about the demolition, 
which probably makes the property more salable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vast majority of property owners run safe, habitable housing," said 
Richard M. Bobb, the deputy city attorney who coordinates the city's Slum 
Housing Task Force and has filed numerous housing violations against the hotel 
owners. "But some very greedy people saw a way to make some money, they made it 
and now they are walking away. And they are expecting taxpayers to take care of 
the problem." One major problem is that some mortgage holders do not want 
liability and refuse to foreclose on very troublesome abandoned property. The 
federal Resolution Trust Corp., which has taken over failed thrifts, is 
notoriously slow to foreclose, housing officials complain. That made it 
difficult to improve a dilapidated apartment building at 1805 Wilcox Ave. in 
Hollywood. Two weeks ago, a band of homeless youths allegedly tortured and 
burned a man to death inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the RTC is on the verge of giving the mortgage to the nonprofit Hollywood 
Community Housing Corp., which hopes to foreclose and use tax credits, 
government loans and grants to renovate it for affordable housing, said the 
group's executive director, Jack Gardner. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar arrangements would be repeated under a proposal by Councilman Mark 
Ridley-Thomas. His idea, modeled after a Chicago program, would have the city 
more aggressively take over properties and quickly appoint nonprofit 
organizations as receivers and owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike New York, Los Angeles "is not interested in becoming the largest 
slumlord in the city," said city Housing Department General Manager Gary W. 
Squier. The best answer would be to prevent abandonment -- the goal of a new 
program using federal funds for low-interest loans to 11 troubled, still 
occupied apartment buildings. But funds are limited. 
</P>
<P>
 One beneficiary is the Luisa Apartments in Boyle Heights, a 63-unit complex 
that opened seven years ago and quickly decayed because of mismanagement and 
crime. While the complex was partly occupied, the nonprofit Pico Union Housing 
Corp. bought it from the RTC and is about to start repairs. "Now we are going 
to have a very nice building for people who really deserve to live there," said 
project manager Genny Alberts. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, the demolition of a building a few blocks away was applauded 
Monday by neighbors and city officials. The Pennsylvania Avenue house had been 
occupied by the notorious Primera Flats gang even after it was badly damaged in 
fires. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials were not only happy that the gang headquarters was gone, they 
were celebrating the rare case in which the owners of the abandoned property, a 
Westside-based family corporation, paid for the work. 
</P>
<P>
 There is often a debate over whether to save a building or tear it down. Even 
when an owner is willing to repair a crumbling structure, the outcome may not 
be certain. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Bretoniere and Richard Monfils, an LAPD narcotics officer in the 
Southeast division, recently revisited a previously vacant and filthy property 
on Croesus Avenue, a few blocks from the Watts Towers. To their surprise, the 
knee-high debris had been removed from the little storefront and rear house. 
One of the owners, Paul Aguilera, was directing a cleaning crew and said he 
hoped to renovate the buildings if he could get financing. The inspector 
encouraged him to keep trying and to take out proper permits. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But then, Monfils discovered what he thought could be signs of crack smoking 
inside. One of Aguilera's friends admitted living in the house, whose front 
door and window glass were missing. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone dies in there, they're going to hang you from the phone poles," De 
La Bretoniere warned the owner, urging him to put up boards and fences soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as he hoped for the best, the inspector was sure he would have to return.

ROSEY GRIER TESTIFIES IN SIMPSON CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD and RALPH FRAMMOLINO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the latest twist of the O.J. Simpson case, former football defensive 
lineman-turned-evangelist Rosey Grier was called to the stand Friday to testify 
about a recent jailhouse conversation with the defendant that allegedly was 
overheard by at least one deputy. Grier's courtroom appearance was prompted by 
declarations and reports filed under seal by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department. Neither prosecutors nor defense attorneys have seen the materials, 
filed late last month directly with Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors, obviously hoping for a jailhouse statement that would bolster 
their case, fought hard to glean the nature of what Simpson said to Grier 
during their Nov. 13 Bible meeting. The defense worked just as aggressively to 
keep the matter private, saying even the most harmless comments between an 
inmate and a clergyman are protected under California law.  
</P>
<P>
 The issue was not resolved Friday; Ito said the hearing will resume next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's session was full of provocative suggestions but produced no 
bombshells. It did, however, shed light on a persistent mystery in the case: 
what prompted a Nov. 29 visit to the jail by Ito and attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 The visit -- one day after the Sheriff's Department filed the declarations -- 
gave the judge a chance to view the visiting room where the incident allegedly 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito said from the bench Friday that he had "gone through these very corridors, 
sat in these very booths" that Grier used when he visited Simpson. The day's 
biggest mystery, however, was not cleared up in court. 
</P>
<P>
 During the legal skirmish, Deputy Dist. Atty. William Hodgman tried 
unsuccessfully to pry the barest details about the statements from a 
stone-faced Grier, who carried a Bible with him to the witness stand. The 
prosecutor seemed particularly interested in establishing whether Simpson 
raised his voice during any meeting with Grier in a third-floor room at the 
Men's Central Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodgman had to fight just to ask the question. Overcoming objections by 
Simpson defense attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., the prosecutor convinced Ito 
that the query was valid because Simpson may have effectively waived his right 
to confidentiality by raising his voice during the guard-monitored visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Did Simpson raise his voice over normal speaking levels, Hodgman asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, sir," Grier answered. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Just before that, Hodgman also tried to gain a legal foothold by asking Grier 
if he discussed such non-spiritual topics as football during that and any other 
visit -- a tactic that evoked a quick objection from Cochran. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether it's football, volleyball. . . . We're asserting the privilege," the 
defense attorney said as Simpson smiled and looked on. Ito did not allow the 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to establish how important the deputies' declaration may be, Hodgman 
asked Ito to consider giving prosecutors a specially prepared version when the 
hearing on the matter resumes Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block said late Friday that 
Block had not seen the sealed papers and that he would decline comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, until things have been adjudicated, we're probably not going to be 
able to make any statements on what transpired and why they were brought before 
the court," said Sgt. Larry Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheriff's Department first brought the Nov. 13 incident to light by 
reporting it directly to Ito on Nov. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 The department filed declarations directly to the judge because of concerns 
that Simpson's conduct during the incident constituted a legal waiver of clergy 
privilege. 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning, Grier said he had no more than casual contact with Simpson 
until June, when the Hall of Famer was charged with the double murders of his 
ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Grier, ordained as a minister in 1986, said he went to the jail chaplain 
seeking permission to visit and give spiritual support to Simpson, who has 
pleaded not guilty to the crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew exactly what he was going through," Grier said. "When it seems like 
everything has crumbled around you and you have nowhere to turn, and there was 
hope. There was a reason to live. There was a reason to continue on, regardless 
of what things looked like. That your life could be changed through the power 
of God." 
</P>
<P>
 During their jailhouse visits, Grier said, he reads the Bible with Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We go over Scriptures. We pray. We discuss various people in the Bible, 
problems they had, talk about who God is. . . . What is sin. We talk about all 
kinds of things in the Bible."  
</P>
<P>
 And the former defensive lineman for the Los Angeles Rams said he tried to 
visit Simpson on Sunday mornings, when the prisoner's mind was not so "clouded 
with so many other things. I thought that if I went on Sunday morning when he 
was rested, that we would have a chance to share the word and he would be able 
to hear clearly without dealing with all the other things at one time." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers had sought to keep the session with Grier private, saying any 
public discussion of the matter could only create an impression that Simpson 
had said something incriminating. Ito initially agreed to close the hearing. 
However, after an attorney representing The Times and other media organizations 
protested, the judge decided to allow reporters into the courtroom on one 
condition: that the actual contents of Simpson's overheard remark not be 
divulged in open court. 
</P>
<P>
 The questioning never came close to eliciting the specific comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Friday, sources provided additional information about a juror who 
allegedly failed to fully disclose on a juror questionnaire past contacts with 
Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Ito met with the juror, a 48-year-old man employed by the Hertz 
Corp., for which Simpson acted as a longtime celebrity spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The juror, sources said, has acknowledged that he may have been at a 
Hertz-sponsored event at Los Angeles International Airport more than 10 years 
ago that Simpson also attended. But he denied having met the former athlete. He 
also has said he never met Simpson's elder daughter, Arnelle, who also worked 
for Hertz briefly last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Without divulging details, defense attorney Cochran said the flap over 
potential juror misconduct is unwarranted. Sources, however, say the defense is 
concerned that prosecutors are trying to get the man kicked off the jury. 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher Darden denied that, saying the prosecution is 
satisfied with the makeup of the jury. He declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Darden himself is at the center of a controversy over the makeup of the 
prosecution team. 
</P>
<P>
 In court Friday morning, defense lawyer Gerald Uelmen set forth legal 
arguments seeking to have Darden removed. . 
</P>
<P>
 The defense objects to Darden's involvement in the case because he headed a 
now-completed grand jury investigation into whether Simpson's best friend, Al 
Cowlings, tried to help the former athlete flee from police five days after the 
murders. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowlings was not indicted. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense contends that the grand jury was not really interested in Cowlings 
but that prosecutors used the panel in an attempt to gather more evidence 
against Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito made no ruling but took the matter under advisement.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; WARNINGS AS EARLY AS 1982 UNHEEDED, AUDITS SHOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WEBER and LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first warnings that someone besides county Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert 
L. Citron needed to know how he was investing the public's money came in an 
internal audit a dozen years ago. Citron, the report said, needed to document 
his investment policies and procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 The next year, an outside auditor made the same recommendation. And in 1985, a 
grand jury stated it more bluntly: Someone should be looking over Citron's 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "There appears to be little or no review of investment activity by the County 
Board of Supervisors, chief administrative officer or auditor-controller," the 
grand jury concluded after conducting an investigation of Citron's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jurors issued this now ominous warning: 
</P>
<P>
 "The county would face a potentially dangerous period of transition if the 
experience of the present leadership were to be lost. This risk is particularly 
evident with the treasurer, an elected official, who personally manages an 
investment portfolio well in excess of $1 billion." 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury report went on to say: "Orange County investment policies, 
processes and cash forecasting procedures are not documented. By contrast, Los 
Angeles County has a well-defined working manual which explains in detail all 
investment policies and procedures." 
</P>
<P>
 More warnings came in an internal 1986 audit. Finally, in a 1993 internal 
audit, came the harshest admonition yet: Citron was knowingly bending the law 
to maximize returns on the now-bankrupt county investment pool, making "risky" 
financial deals and refusing to consult a committee charged with overseeing his 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 But for nearly a decade, no one heeded warning after warning -- although they 
came from inside, outside and from the watchdog grand jury -- that Citron was 
holding all the cards in the treasurer's office, and not allowing anyone a peek 
at his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after the biggest municipal financial collapse in the nation's history, a 
simple question begs an answer: Why didn't someone react to the mounting 
criticism and 12-year push for oversight of the county's maverick treasurer? 
Was everyone in the fund blinded by the money that Citron was earning for them 
until his investments headed south? 
</P>
<P>
 Citron, who has remained largely in seclusion since Sunday, referred all 
questions to his newly hired attorney, David Weichert, a former federal 
prosecutor turned criminal defense attorney. Weichert defended one of the 
executives in Charles H. Keating Jr.'s fraud-ridden financial empire and a LAPD 
detective who was one of six narcotics investigators tried some years back on 
federal conspiracy and theft charges. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner, who joined the board four months before the 
critical 1993 audit came out, and board veteran Supervisor Thomas F. Riley 
acknowledged that they had received copies of the audit, but did not remember 
it. "There was nothing here that required a policy change," said Supervisor 
Thomas F. Riley, holding a copy of the audit Friday. In any event, Riley added, 
he did not believe that the audit was overly critical of the treasurer's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should have been a huge red flag," conceded a pained Steiner, who 
unearthed the audit in his office after news reports Friday morning. "(The 
audit) did not get on the board agenda. It simply was not visible." 
</P>
<P>
 The three remaining supervisors said they could not locate their copies of the 
audit. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Harriett Wieder said that in hindsight the 12 years of warnings 
should have packed the wallop of "a 2-by-4" -- had she heard of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the environment in those days, he was not questioned," she said. "I feel 
frustrated that I was not in control. . . . I don't remember the grand jury 
report. I don't know, and I don't remember." 
</P>
<P>
 But Wieder, who was on the board when the 1985 grand jury report was made 
public, said Citron was making so much money that no one thought to question 
the man Wall Street praised, and certainly not about affairs they were hardly 
qualified to understand or judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not Wall Street brokers," Wieder said. "We rely on the people we hire 
to do it for us." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, she questioned whether the people charged with oversight needed 
some oversight themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder said she just found out Friday that the monthly reports of investment 
activity that are required under state law to be distributed to board members 
by the treasurer ceased three years ago, "and no one told us." 
</P>
<P>
 She also criticized Auditor-Controller Steven Lewis for not placing the audit 
and Citron's response to it in the public realm. The audit and answer were 
marked "Not for Board Agenda" and were distributed directly to supervisors, the 
district attorney and the county administrative officer. But they were not 
included in the packet of board material that is made public before the weekly 
board meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Lewis) might be covering his rear. How do I know?" Wieder said. 
</P>
<P>
 She fired off a letter to Lewis Friday afternoon, criticizing him for not 
personally alerting board members to the internal audit's inflammatory 
contents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am shocked and disbelieving that you did not ensure that it would be 
brought to our attention personally or to (the attention of) the county 
administrative officer," she wrote. "I can only conclude that it was 
carelessness, indifference or bureaucratic evasiveness."  
</P>
<P>
 Wieder demanded to know why it took 18 months to complete the internal audit, 
why the findings of the report were not pursued more aggressively, and where 
the standard six-month follow-up report was. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis declined to comment on the audits Friday, or to answer questions about 
Citron's efforts to comply with his office's recommendations. He was also 
unavailable to comment on how he could issue such a critical report of Citron 
in August, 1993, and then offer a ringing public endorsement of Citron the next 
spring when Citron drew his first political challenger in 24 years in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said he did not recall getting the report and did 
not review it until Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a mystery to me as to why we did not see the report or why it would not 
have found its way to us," he said. "We didn't have it." 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the report did not necessarily warn of impending crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not uncommon for some of these audits to contain differences of 
opinion, where the auditor-controller suggests certain methods of operation, 
and the other department head disagrees," he said. "When you look to all the 
people who have been involved in investing, participating, evaluating, 
monitoring the investments, there were no glaring signs or signals being 
transmitted that something was awry." 
</P>
<P>
 The internal audit specifically warned supervisors that when Citron "deviated 
from guidelines established by government code or the investment committee, he 
did so without consulting anyone in the treasurer's office or on the 
committee." 
</P>
<P>
 Citron also told auditors that when he violated government codes "the 
instances were conscious decisions made to maximize returns." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Dist. Atty. Michael Capizzi said Friday that he did not know if 
his office had received a copy of the audit. However, after reviewing it, he 
said there was nothing in it that would have "triggered action" by his 
department. If laws were broken, they were of a civil, not criminal, nature, 
and were not the responsibility of his office. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez said that because he did not begin his term on the board until 1987, 
he could not comment on the earlier audits or the grand jury report. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to a five-member group of grand jurors charged with investigating 
Citron's office's investment procedures in 1985, county supervisors should have 
started some reforms a decade sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the jurors found that Citron was "making effective use of the variety 
and sophistication of the broad range of investment instruments," they were 
concerned that no one but Citron knew how he juggled the tools. 
</P>
<P>
 As did the audits in 1982 and 1983, the grand jury urged that Citron put his 
investment style on paper and "maintain written procedures covering all major 
areas of the investment and cash management functions" because his activities 
"affect virtually all of the county's operations." 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jurors also urged that Citron provide supervisors with monthly 
reports detailing the types of investments, the institutions they were from, 
the dates of their maturity, the amounts of deposit, the current market value 
for all securities with a maturity of more than 12 months and the rate of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 An internal audit in 1986 conducted by the county auditor-controller echoed 
many of the same concerns, saying that many of the complicated financial 
maneuvers in the treasurer's office "are often performed and understood by only 
one person." It again called for written policies and procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1986 audit refers to many of the findings of the 1982 internal audit, the 
outside 1983 audit and the grand jury report. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to the 1986 audit, Citron said that written policies and procedures 
are prepared to "solve a problem in a particular area" as problems arise, 
adding that "in these difficult economic and budgetary times we do not deem it 
appropriate to request resources specifically for this purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 The auditors bluntly said Citron "should develop policies and procedures prior 
to the occurrences of problems rather than in response to them." 
</P>
<P>
 The audit also criticized Citron for failing to submit investment policies for 
1986 and 1987, despite a board resolution to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "The treasurer has obtained good yields on his investment of county funds," 
the auditors said. "Even so, we believe it prudent for the Board of Supervisors 
and the county administrative officer to become more involved in the county's 
investment program." 
</P>
<P>
 And in another now-eerie warning, the auditors cautioned that "the investment 
function has a tremendous impact on the funding of the county's entire 
operations and the added participation of the board and CAO should help ensure 
that investment strategies and policies best serve the county." 
</P>
<P>
 The audit recommended setting up an investment committee as a way of "assuring 
a long-term, consistent investment strategy." It is this committee that 1991 
auditors found that Citron was pointedly dodging when he made "risky" or 
"unusual" investments. Until last week, the committee, according to the 1991 
audit, was made up of Citron, now-Acting Treasurer Matt Raabe and County 
Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Schneider said there was "no way" the committee could have forced 
Citron to do anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe the board can be held responsible for what another elected 
public official has done," he said. "I can't do everyone's job. I can only do 
my job, and I think I do it pretty good. Until this episode, we have done 
stellar work."

CLINTON LINKS FREE TRADE, JOBS AT SUMMIT; SPEECH: PRESIDENT ALSO LAUDS HIS OWN 
DOMESTIC ECONOMIC POLICIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton opened the first summit meeting of Western Hemisphere 
leaders in a generation Friday with a call for a new free-trade "partnership 
for prosperity" -- plus a plea to U.S. voters to credit him with the creation 
of millions of new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech to Florida political, business and civic figures before he plunged 
into talks with the leaders of 33 other countries, Clinton said the weekend's 
giant meeting will cement a new kind of relationship between the United States 
and its newly democratic and prosperous neighbors to the south. 
</P>
<P>
 "History has given the peoples of the Americas a dazzling opportunity to build 
a community of nations committed to the values of liberty, progress and 
prosperity," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he also delivered a fervent domestic political pitch, saying his economic 
policies are working better than most Americans realize -- in part through the 
creation of free-trade areas like the one that will be this summit's 
centerpiece. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're successful, the summit will lead to more jobs, opportunity and 
prosperity," Clinton said. "If we act wisely, then we can make this new world 
work for us. Trade can be a benefit for our people." 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to link his economic diplomacy and his domestic agenda, the President 
noted that increased U.S. exports create high-wage jobs -- and may even have 
begun to halt the 20-year stagnation in real wages that he has long decried. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope that we are seeing the beginning of the end of a 20-year trend in 
stagnant wages, and the beginning of the restoration of the American dream by 
reaching out to the world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every American worker in every part of the United States should be glad that 
we are here at the Summit of the Americas," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 A Central American official at the summit said Latin governments understand 
Clinton's need to pitch his message to a U.S. domestic audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw the election returns just as you did," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the President's decision to scrap an initial draft of his speech, which 
concentrated on the advances of democracy in Latin America, and turn it into a 
domestic political message reflects a resolve in the White House to turn every 
occasion to Clinton's most urgent priority: rehabilitating his appeal to voters 
who elected him in 1992 but turned away in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been our message for a long time," White House spokeswoman Dee Dee 
Myers said, "but it hasn't been noticed. So he has to keep making the point." 
</P>
<P>
 From a public-image standpoint, other officials noted, Clinton won't have many 
opportunities during the summit to address domestic issues, since his 
appearances will be tied more closely to the meeting's core agenda: free trade, 
democracy and economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they expect Clinton, as the summit host, to make two major 
announcements during the weekend: the leaders' agreement to begin work toward 
an Americas Free Trade Area, to be in place by the year 2005, and an immediate 
invitation to Chile to join the United States, Mexico and Canada in the 
year-old North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Chile is being allowed into NAFTA first because it is "further along with 
economic reform (and) with an open economy than other countries in the region," 
Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said. Chile was given a choice between 
joining NAFTA or negotiating a separate free-trade agreement, and it decided 
simply to adhere to the accord already in place, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to drafts of their expected declarations that have circulated 
widely, the summit leaders also plan to launch new cooperative efforts to curb 
drug trafficking and money laundering, protect the environment and promote 
human rights, education and health. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton barely mentioned those efforts in his speech, concentrating 
instead on selling the benefits of wider trade to a wary U.S. public. 
</P>
<P>
 The new, hemisphere-wide free-trade area could help create more than a million 
new jobs, he said -- "good-paying jobs; on average, export-related jobs pay 17% 
more than average wages." 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials distributed a fact sheet saying U.S. exports to Latin 
America accounted for 1.3 million jobs last year and produced a trade surplus 
of more than $4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's comment that the 20-year period of stagnating real wages might be 
ending appeared to be something of a throwaway line. But it reflected his 
search for a new way to persuade voters that the economy has changed for the 
better under his Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the long-term trend in wages, Labor Secretary Robert B. Reich said 
the picture was, in fact, mixed; well-educated workers are seeing their incomes 
increase while unskilled workers are seeing theirs decline, he said. Other 
economists dispute the idea that wages have been flat, saying total 
compensation has in fact increased over the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The Summit of the Americas, as it is officially named, is the first gathering 
of the leaders of the Western Hemisphere since 1967, when then-President Lyndon 
B. Johnson traveled to a similar meeting in Punta del Este, Uruguay. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton pointed out that in 1967, 10 of the nations of the Western Hemisphere 
lived under dictatorships of the left or right. Today, after the restoration of 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide as Haiti's elected president, every independent country 
in the hemisphere is democratic -- with the sole exception of Communist-ruled 
Cuba, whose leader, Fidel Castro, was not invited. 
</P>
<P>
 In his speech at the Jackie Gleason Theater for the Performing Arts in Miami 
Beach -- once the site of the rotund comedian's television revue -- Clinton 
drew his biggest applause from the Florida audience when he reaffirmed the U.S. 
policy of economic pressure on the Castro regime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We support the Cuban people's desire for peaceful democratic change," he 
said. "And we hope by the next time we have one of these summits . . . a 
democratic Cuba will take its place at the table of nations."

CLINTON FIRES SURGEON GENERAL OVER NEW FLAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER and MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<P>
 President Clinton fired outspoken Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders on Friday 
for telling an AIDS forum that she believes masturbation "perhaps should be 
taught" to schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Ousting the most controversial official of his Administration, Clinton said 
Elders' comments reflect "differences with Administration policy and my own 
convictions, and have made it necessary for her to tender her resignation." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton delivered word of his decision in an afternoon phone call to the 
61-year-old physician, who has come under fire from conservatives for her 
outspoken views on sex education, distribution of condoms and legalization of 
drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton had disagreed with a series of earlier Elders statements, according to 
White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta. "There is a record of those 
statements, as all of you know," Panetta said. "But some of them involved 
Catholics having a love affair with fetuses, comments about legalizing drugs, 
comments regarding teaching 5-year-olds the use of condoms." 
</P>
<P>
 But the latest comment, Panetta said, "is just one too many." Clinton believes 
notions that schools should teach masturbation "are wrong, and feels that's not 
what schools are for," Panetta said. "And it is not what a surgeon general 
should say." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with CBS News late Friday, Elders said she was not ashamed of 
what she did as surgeon general. "I think we all may wish we said things 
differently, but I have no regrets. Words are strange things. Once they are 
out, you can't get them back." 
</P>
<P>
 Elders said she was asked to resign as a result of several controversial 
statements she made since taking office, not just the most recent remark on 
masturbation. "Nothing is ever the result of just one thing," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elders, who was Clinton's health secretary for five years in Arkansas before 
joining the Administration, made her comments before an audience of several 
hundred people gathered in New York last week for World AIDS Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid a discussion of AIDS prevention, she was asked by an audience member 
about the prospects that masturbation could be more openly discussed and 
promoted as a means of keeping young people from riskier sexual activity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that it is something that's part of human sexuality and it's part of 
something that perhaps should be taught," she said. "But we've not even taught 
our children the very basics. And I feel that we have tried ignorance for a 
very long time and it's time we try education." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Elders' departure eliminates a figure who had become an increasing source of 
vulnerability for the Administration at a time when it could ill afford more 
attacks from the right. Although rumors of her ouster were circulating within 
the White House before disclosure of the latest incident, officials denied that 
the firing was a sign of Clinton's move toward the political right. 
</P>
<P>
 The firing brought swift reaction from conservatives, who called it overdue 
and hailed it as a sign of the after-effects of conservative victories in last 
month's midterm elections. But some liberal groups, including gays and family 
planning organizations, defended Elders as a public-spirited official who told 
the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said Elders did not try to talk Clinton out of the decision. In a 
statement, Elders said: "I feel this halfway point is a good time for me to go. 
While some Administration officials and I have some honest differences over the 
issues, President Clinton and I maintain our strong mutual respect for each 
other." 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials said the decision to fire Elders was prompted by word on 
Thursday that U.S. News & World Report was about to publish an account of the 
comments in next week's editions. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta said that he, Clinton and Donna Shalala, secretary of health and human 
services, already had warned Elders about statements that diverged from 
Administration views. 
</P>
<P>
 Elders, a pediatric endocrinologist, said from the beginning of her term that 
she intended to use her position to promote widespread school-based sex 
education and services for teen-agers, including the availability of 
contraceptives. She also said she would advocate freedom of choice in abortion 
and the medicinal use of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 After her confirmation, she enraged critics by suggesting that the nation 
study legalizing drugs as a way of reducing crime. 
</P>
<P>
 To the Administration's embarrassment, her son, Kevin, was arrested in July, 
1993, for selling one-eighth of an ounce of cocaine. He was later sentenced to 
10 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 In one interview, Elders annoyed the Girl Scouts by saying that "girls who are 
lesbians should be allowed to join the Girl Scouts." The organization responded 
by saying it had no official policy on sexual orientation and had been unfairly 
attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 Last June, 87 GOP congressmen asked Clinton to fire her for remarks she made 
encouraging gays and lesbians to save children from "the un-Christian religious 
right." The White House responded with a letter of support that contained a 
disclaimer insisting that Elders' opinions "do not necessarily reflect those of 
the President and his Administration as a whole." 
</P>
<P>
 Later last summer, Panetta told reporters that he had lectured Elders for 
saying that Catholic priests and others who oppose abortion have "a love affair 
with the fetus." 
</P>
<P>
 Elders' departure marks a further diminution of the large group of Arkansans 
who joined Clinton in Washington in the heady early days of his Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 She served as chief of the Arkansas health department under then-Gov. Clinton, 
who appointed her in 1987, and served in that position until he nominated her 
for the surgeon general's post. She joked at the time that "he said when I was 
appointed director of health in Arkansas that he didn't know what he was 
getting. After five years, he knows what he is getting." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clinton sometimes pointed out his differences with Elders, he also 
seemed proud that his Administration could tolerate an official of such 
controversial views. 
</P>
<P>
 After she urged consideration of drug legalization in 1993, Clinton defended 
Elders' right to be "outspoken and energetic in a way that I don't necessarily 
agree with." 
</P>
<P>
 But Elders' comments were so controversial that even members of Clinton's own 
Administration did not hesitate to take shots at them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Friday on the Court TV cable network, Thomas Constantine, 
administrator of the Drug Enforcement Administration, called Elders' support 
for drug legalization "totally inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 "If somebody at that level of a surgeon general (is) talking about 
legalization as an appropriate remedy, we've lost our will to do something 
about it. . . . I think it's a crazy idea." 
</P>
<P>
 William J. Bennett, a conservative scholar and former education secretary, 
said Elders' firing was "appropriate today and it was appropriate a year ago. 
She's really in a class by herself in terms of bizarre comments, out of the 
mainstream attitudes and embarrassment to the Administration." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bennett said Clinton's action Friday was a cynical political decision made 
as he lurches to the right in response to last month's election results. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would call this the first personnel decision of the new Republican 
majority," Bennett said. "They're just reading the winds and pretending they're 
'shocked' by this most recent statement and not the long history of 
statements." 
</P>
<P>
 But other conservatives lamented the loss of a valuable target.

SOCIAL SECURITY IS TARGET OF PLAN TO CONTROL DEFICIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Offering a radical solution to the federal deficit problem, the leaders of a 
bipartisan commission on Friday proposed cutting Social Security taxes, 
requiring all workers to open private retirement accounts and gradually raising 
the age for full retirement and Medicare benefits to 70. 
</P>
<P>
 "I intend to take this problem to the American people and have them solve it," 
said Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.), co-chairman of the Bipartisan Commission on 
Entitlement and Tax Reform, as he unveiled a proposal that was immediately 
denounced by labor and senior citizens groups as a mean-spirited attack on the 
Social Security system. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrey and his co-chairman, Sen. John C. Danforth (R-Mo.), offered their 
provocative plan to stimulate a national debate over the growth in spending for 
federal entitlement programs -- Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, 
government pensions, welfare and financial aid for farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 The entitlement commission is scheduled to vote Wednesday, with the goal of 
getting 20 of the 32 members to agree on recommendations for President Clinton. 
It seems doubtful, however, that Kerrey and Danforth can muster that support 
for their plan or any other. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes that the two senators called for would not take effect until after 
the year 2000. And the major impact would be restricted to workers now under 
age 40, Kerrey said. For example, the increase in the retirement age would come 
in stages until it reaches age 70 for full benefits in the year 2034. Currently 
a worker can collect full benefits at age 65. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the commission opened its meeting Friday to discuss the 
Kerrey-Danforth plan, opponents were holding a news conference to denounce the 
proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The changes "would be a disaster for the working people who depend on programs 
like Social Security and Medicare to make ends meet when they retire," said 
Thomas Donohue, secretary-treasurer of the AFL-CIO. 
</P>
<P>
 By making technical changes to make benefits less generous -- slowing down 
annual benefit increases and tinkering with the formula used to calculate 
benefits -- the proposal could reduce Social Security payments as much as 50% 
for future retirees, according to Robert Ball, a former Social Security 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Because African Americans have a shorter life expectancy than whites, the 
Kerrey-Danforth plan "literally precludes most African Americans from even 
being able to take advantage of Social Security," said Wade Henderson, director 
of the Washington office of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored 
People. That, he said, could have the potential of "exacerbating racial 
tensions."  
</P>
<P>
 And the nation's largest senior citizens group, the 33-million member American 
Assn. of Retired Persons, denounced Kerrey's plan as "short-sighted at best, 
mean-spirited at worst." 
</P>
<P>
 The strongly worded attacks prompted one commission member, Sen. Alan K. 
Simpson (R-Wyo.), to tell his colleagues, "We are just about to be blasted out 
of the water with raw political fear."  
</P>
<P>
 The debate focuses on whether entitlement spending represents a crisis or 
simply a problem. At current rates of spending, these popular programs -- plus 
interest on the federal debt -- will consume all federal tax revenues by the 
year 2012, leaving nothing for defense, education, job training or anything 
else.  
</P>
<P>
 The Kerrey-Danforth plan aims to slow the growth of entitlement spending in an 
effort to keep the federal deficit at the same share of the nation's total 
economic output, about 2.5%. Wiping out the deficit entirely would require much 
deeper cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Action must be taken now, Kerrey said, or the promise of Social Security and 
Medicare will be broken for "our children and grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have promises on the table we can't keep," he said at the commission 
meeting Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics insist there is no need for Draconian cuts. "These programs are a 
basic part of the society America aspires to be," said David Saltz, an AFL-CIO 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There is no crisis, the critics say. They note that Social Security is in 
ample surplus, taking in more revenues than it spends for benefits. The 
retirement fund won't run out of benefits until the year 2029, and modest 
changes can be made over the coming years, they argue. 
</P>
<P>
 They also say that only two of 400 entitlement programs, Medicare -- for 
persons over 65 and the disabled -- and Medicaid -- the health care program for 
the poor -- are in bad financial shape. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kerrey-Danforth plan unveiled Friday would slow the growth of spending by 
raising the age for full Social Security and Medicare benefits to 70. 
</P>
<P>
 To provide an alternative source of funds for retirement, the Social Security 
payroll tax, now 6.2%, would be reduced to 4.7% for each worker. With the other 
1.5%, workers would be required to open individual savings accounts that, with 
proper investments, would grow to provide money for retirement, Kerrey said. 
The extra savings would give workers money for retirement before they reach the 
age for Social Security benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 By making benefits less generous and increasing the retirement age, the 
government's retirement fund should come into fiscal balance, according to the 
Kerrey-Danforth plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Medicare enrollees could choose to remain in the federal program or enroll in 
a private health insurance plan with a voucher paid for by the government. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who stay with Medicare, a premium would be imposed for the hospital 
trust fund, which is now financed from payroll tax revenues only. The 
deductible for doctors services under Medicare would be increased to $300 from 
its current level of $100 a year, and beneficiaries would be required to pay 
additional amounts for the cost of laboratory tests and home health care 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Payments would be reduced to doctors and hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 All other entitlements, including farm price supports and welfare payments, 
would be cut by 10% and their growth would be limited to reflect changes in the 
consumer price index and the increase in population.

WORLD PERSPECTIVE; PEACE PRIZE; ON NOBEL DAY, REALITY FALLS SHORT OF NOBLE 
HOPES; ARAFAT, SHAMIR AND PERES ARE HONORED FOR THEIR EFFORTS TOWARD MIDEAST 
PEACE EVEN AS ANALYSTS SAY A MIRACLE WOULD BE NEEDED TO PUSH THE PROCESS

<P>
 The hopes for a Middle East peace, ignited when Israel and the Palestine 
Liberation Organization reached their historic agreement on Palestinian 
self-government last year, seem to be fading even as the men who fashioned the 
Declaration of Principles receive the Nobel Peace Prize here today. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, who 
forged what they proudly called the "peace of the brave," complain that the 
other is not honoring the accord. 
</P>
<P>
 Their supporters are bitter about the failures, asking daily about the 
promised peace and the "new Middle East." Their opponents scream "betrayal" 
ever more loudly. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, a visionary statesman with almost 
boundless optimism, has grown tired. Frustrated by the lack of progress, he 
acknowledges that the agreement he fashioned in months of secret negotiations 
here last year may have to be amended. 
</P>
<P>
 Shlomo Gazit, a retired Israeli general and one of the region's foremost 
strategic analysts, calls the Nobel awards ceremony at which Rabin, Peres and 
Arafat will be honored today "the last chord of a dying process." 
</P>
<P>
 Only a "miracle" -- tough decisions taken unflinchingly on hard issues by the 
now-wavering leaders -- will restore lost momentum to Arab-Israeli peacemaking, 
Gazit said. Few in the Middle East would disagree that this would be a 
political miracle. 
</P>
<P>
 That reality fell short of both Israeli and Palestinian hopes is clear. 
</P>
<P>
 Israelis, for whom security is paramount, count more than 70 dead in the last 
year, most civilians and half of them killed in suicide bombings carried out in 
Israeli cities by Islamic radicals opposed to the peace accord. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Palestinians in the Gaza Strip have seen a sharp decline in their already 
miserable living standards since Arafat's Palestinian Authority took charge of 
the territory in May. Only a third of the $700 million promised by the West in 
immediate economic assistance has materialized as the PLO and the World Bank 
have argued about accounting practices. 
</P>
<P>
 In the West Bank, the Palestinian Authority now operates the education, 
health, welfare and tourism departments. It is starting to collect taxes to 
finance these services. But Israeli troops remain heavily deployed in the 
region, and deadly clashes with residents continue. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinians' first national elections, originally scheduled for last July 
and intended to establish a democratically chosen government for the West Bank 
and Gaza Strip, have been postponed once and twice again while Israel and the 
PLO negotiated the size and powers of the planned council. If agreement is 
reached soon on the council, elections might be held in spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat's political leadership and his day-to-day administration are widely 
criticized by Palestinians as ranging from inept to chaotic, from corrupt to 
despotic. After Palestinian police fought bloody battles with the Islamic 
Resistance Movement, a radical fundamentalist group known as Hamas, there were 
fears of a Palestinian civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gap between ceremony and reality is stretching the peace process to its 
limits, not just between the two opposing sides (Arabs and Israelis) but also 
between the social classes here," commentator Doron Rosenblum wrote last month 
in the influential Israeli newspaper Haaretz in terms that also echoed 
Palestinian complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the patrician caste in power, which travels by Volvo or Mercedes, there 
is no end to festivities, to trips abroad, to toasts drunk in fine company," he 
noted. "Meanwhile, those who travel by bus and shop in the markets continue to 
be targets of terrorism, to pay ever-higher prices and taxes and to lose their 
savings in a crumbling stock market. It is no wonder that not just Palestinians 
but also more and more Israelis are asking what exactly they have gained from 
the peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin, who with Peres was jeered by right-wing Israelis and American Jews as 
they left synagogue services here Friday night, acknowledged the opposition he 
faces at home but reminded critics: "We came (to power) after democratic 
elections to bring about a change in the Middle East, to give peace a chance. . 
. . Of course, there are risks, but the opportunities are much greater." 
</P>
<P>
 People should "not expect immediate results -- not everything in life is 
instantaneous," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Israelis see the "peace process" as an experiment they evaluate at each 
stage before deciding whether to go on. Right now, there is much hesitation; 
even Rabin's Cabinet needed three days' debate this week on how, even whether, 
to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Palestinians, the question is no less profound. "It is hard to see how 
all this is leading to an independent Palestine," said Dr. Haidar Abdel-Shafi, 
the respected Gaza physician who led the Palestinian delegation to the 1991 
Middle East peace conference in Madrid. "What I think we are beginning to 
understand is the illusory nature of the Oslo agreement. . . . But how do we 
get out of it? We may have gone much too far to turn back, but may have also 
made it impossible for ourselves to go forward." 
</P>
<P>
 For all this, however, there are achievements that were difficult for most 
Israelis and Palestinians to imagine before the Declaration of Principles was 
signed. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from troops guarding Jewish settlements, Israel has withdrawn its forces 
from the Gaza Strip, ending 27 years of military occupation and permitting 
establishment of the first-ever Palestinian administration there. This was no 
less a gain for Israelis than it was for the 850,000 Gazans. 
</P>
<P>
 As they begin take over government functions in the West Bank, Palestinians 
are laying a firmer foundation than in Gaza for the independent state they hope 
to establish at the end of the five-year period of autonomy. 
</P>
<P>
 Palestinian political violence -- factional clashes, assassinations, 
widespread security arrests -- has been far less than many top Israeli 
officials predicted; Arafat's efforts have been aimed largely at bringing his 
opponents into the embryonic political system. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And, as even critics of Israel's accord with the PLO acknowledge, without that 
agreement addressing the core issue of the Arab-Israeli conflict there would 
not have been the Israeli peace treaty with Jordan, the Middle East economic 
summit in Casablanca, Morocco, and prospects of a treaty with Syria next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We carry a very heavy burden for our own people, for the Palestinian nation, 
but we also have a burden for the other Arabs," said Nabil Shaath, the 
Palestinian planning minister and a top negotiator with Israel, "for resolution 
of the Palestinian problem is the precondition for resolution of the whole 
Arab-Israeli conflict and thus for peace in the Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement worked out in the months of secret talks in and around Oslo by 
Israel and the PLO with Norwegian mediation, in fact, set Arafat a task verging 
on the impossible: The PLO was to take the Gaza Strip -- one of the most 
impoverished, pestilential and violent places in the Middle East -- and within 
months turn it into a showcase of democracy, prosperity and tranquillity. 
</P>
<P>
 The PLO's success would depend on Israel's pullback in the West Bank, further 
negotiations on the status of Jerusalem, the future of Jewish settlements in 
the Palestinian territories and, above all, a Palestinian state, perhaps 
independent but probably linked to Jordan in a confederation. 
</P>
<P>
 All this might bring only a "small peace" -- the absence of war -- but it is a 
peace that Rabin and some Arab leaders see as an effective alliance between the 
Jewish state and its moderate Arab neighbors against the spread of Islamic 
radicalism.

EPA WILL EASE RULES FOR STATES ON TOUGHER CAR EMISSION TESTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration, seeking to blunt a revolt in some states about new 
air pollution controls, has agreed to ease its requirements for more stringent 
and costly automobile tailpipe emissions testing. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA Administrator Carol Browner promised a group of governors that they would 
be given more flexibility in meeting the new vehicle-testing regulations as 
long as overall pollution-reduction levels are met, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A requirement for more sophisticated testing of automobile tailpipe emissions 
has been controversial in a number of Northeast states, where motorists have 
protested the increased cost and inconvenience. Other states, including 
California, also have sought more flexibility than the EPA previously had been 
willing to give. 
</P>
<P>
 Browner, meeting with seven governors Thursday evening, agreed to provide 
increased flexibility in the testing program, agency officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still insisting that you get the 15% reductions (in pollution) that 
you're required to get," said Nancy Sutley, a special assistant to Browner for 
clean-air issues. She said if states choose not to use the more sophisticated 
"enhanced" auto emissions testing program, they must find alternative sources 
of air pollution reduction.

 Pope John Paul II, in a written message, said women have a full right to a 
place in all walks of public life but that their role in the family is 
paramount. The Pope, who has come under fire from women's groups and some nuns 
for upholding a ban on ordaining women, praised women's progress in pursuing 
careers outside the family and said their right to a role in public life must 
be protected. But he said the roles of wife and mother are the most important.

BRITISH, IRA WING HOLD FIRST-EVER FORMAL TALKS; PEACE: THE SIDES ARE SEPARATED 
BY THEIR DEMANDS, BUT THE MEETING IS AMICABLE BETWEEN GOVERNMENT, SINN FEIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM TUOHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leaders of the British government and Sinn Fein, the political arm of the 
Irish Republican Army, held their first-ever formal talks Friday as part of the 
continuing search for peace in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 At the historic meeting in Belfast, the British insisted that the IRA must 
hand over weapons and explosives as part of a permanent settlement and that a 
majority of the people in Northern Ireland should determine the eventual fate 
of the troubled province. 
</P>
<P>
 Sinn Fein, for its part, called for an end to British military operations in 
Northern Ireland, where a 3-month-old cease-fire is holding after 25 years of 
violence, and argued that the Irish people of both north and south should 
decide the province's future. 
</P>
<P>
 The amicable talks, the first such negotiations in 22 years, lasted more than 
three hours in Stormont Castle, once the seat of Northern Ireland's government 
when the province was largely self-governed. Both parties agreed to meet again 
Dec. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Former IRA member Martin McGuinness, who led Sinn Fein's delegation, told 
reporters: "This is an opportunity which needs to be built upon. It is now time 
to liberate the oppressed and the oppressor." 
</P>
<P>
 McGuinness, leading a five-member delegation that included a man and woman 
convicted on terrorist charges, said the speedy release of IRA political 
prisoners would greatly help the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, the British government would not speak directly with Sinn Fein, 
because for years its leaders refused to renounce violence in its campaign to 
unify the island. But the British have now accepted that the cease-fire, which 
began Aug. 31, is evidence that the IRA is renouncing violence, and the 
government now feels free to talk directly to Sinn Fein leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 But hard-line Protestant Unionists, who want Northern Ireland to stay part of 
the United Kingdom, bitterly protested the direct talks between London and Sinn 
Fein. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Ian Paisley, leader of the Democratic Unionist Party, declared that 
the British decision to deal with Sinn Fein was "an utter disgrace." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not worried about who Sinn Fein brings to talks," Paisley said, "I'm 
worried about the talks themselves. They shouldn't have taken place anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Britain's minister for Northern Ireland, Michael Ancram, said after the Friday 
talks that they were "businesslike and constructive" and that everyone "should 
take encouragement from them." 
</P>
<P>
 But he added that illegal arms are a "central issue" in the peace process, 
saying, "Their safe disposal will provide convincing evidence of a permanent 
end to the use of violence and of commitment to exclusively peaceful methods 
and the democratic process." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams said at a press conference that the British 
should not use the arms issue as an excuse to block talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure the British government recognizes that as part of a lasting 
settlement there needs to be a decommissioning of all weapons, (including) the 
decommissioning of the British army," he said.

 A media storm over the resignation of a top left-wing British journalist 
accused of spying for the former Soviet Union deepened as editors called for 
publication of a full list of former KGB agents. Richard Gott, literary editor 
of the Guardian newspaper, said in a published letter it was "culpable 
stupidity" for him to have kept his contacts with the Soviets secret, and he 
admitted accepting paid trips abroad during the 1960s. But Gott, 56, denied 
allegations by the conservative Spectator magazine that he was paid $935 by a 
KGB agent and also suggested names of other journalist recruits.

 Most of the 1,000 Cubans who escaped from refugee camps in Panama were back in 
custody after two days of riots injured more than 200 U.S. soldiers.The 
refugees, fed up with U.S. promises to find them permanent homes, broke down 
large sections of barbed wire encircling two camps, and some ran away Thursday. 
A day later, all but 40 had been returned. Refugees said one person drowned in 
the Panama Canal, where some tried to swim to freedom. But a military 
spokeswoman said she had no reports of deaths.

CHINESE FIRE BLAMED ON SHORT CIRCUIT, FLAMMABLE CURTAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A tragic fire that killed at least 300 schoolchildren and teachers in a movie 
theater in remote northwestern China was caused when sparks from an electrical 
short circuit ignited flammable stage curtains and quickly spread into the 
crowded hall, officials here said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the tragedy, the State Council issued an emergency circular 
ordering local governments to inspect dance halls, cinemas, theaters, 
restaurants, stores and other public places for fire safety. Although China has 
fire code standards on the books, they are inconsistently enforced. 
</P>
<P>
 "The causes of such fires must be thoroughly investigated and the culprits 
brought to justice," said the emergency circular, reproduced on the front pages 
of most newspapers today. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the State Council, the Chinese central governing body, said 
most of the victims of the Thursday night fire in the Friendship Hall cinema in 
Karamay, an oil boom town in Xinjiang region, died of burns and suffocation. 
</P>
<P>
 According to several reports, several emergency exits and windows in the 
Karamay movie theater were locked. Some of the dead were reportedly found 
clumped behind one of the blocked exits. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 people were seriously injured and undergoing treatment at the 
Karamay Crude Oil General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 It was China's second major fire disaster in two weeks. A Nov. 27 fire at a 
dance hall in Liaoning province claimed 233 lives, most of them students. The 
two fires were the most serious to hit China since 1979, when another movie 
theater fire in Xinjiang region killed more than 600 people. 
</P>
<P>
 The news agency Reuters reported that most of the children killed were honors 
students chosen by their schools to participate in a special cultural program 
staged for a visiting education evaluation team. Karamay, a city of 200,000 
residents, most of whom work in the nearby oil fields, has 17 primary and 
middle schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We only have a certain number of schools, and they all sent their best 
students," a teacher at the No. 2 Secondary School said in a telephone 
interview. "So in every corner of town there are families who have lost 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the official New China News Agency, senior leaders of the 
provincial government, as well as Communist Party cadres, traveled to Karamay, 
180 miles northeast of Urumqi in the Junggar Basin, to coordinate relief 
efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "An initial investigation showed that the fire may have been caused by a short 
circuit in the wiring," the news agency reported. "The victims included 
teachers and pupils from the city. Most were primary school students. All of 
the injured have been taken to local hospitals." 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year more than 1,500 people have died in 30,000 reported fires in 
China.

SYRIA TO RESUME ISRAELI CONTACTS AFTER LONG BREAK

<P>
 Damascus will resume contacts with Israel in Washington after a 10-month 
deadlock in their peace talks, Syria's foreign minister said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Farouk Shareh's comments marked a shift in Syria's position.Damascus has 
repeatedly refused to resume talks unless Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher's shuttle diplomacy produces progress. Christopher visited the 
region this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Shareh said he expects the United States, co-sponsor of the Mideast peace 
process, to make an announcement soon about an "exchange of ideas" between 
small Syrian and Israeli delegations. The exchange could set the stage for the 
resumption of full-scale talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Shareh spoke at Beirut's airport, where he arrived with a message from Syrian 
President Hafez Assad for his Lebanese counterpart, Elias Hrawi. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Pelletreau, the assistant U.S. secretary of state for Near East 
affairs, was also in Lebanon to brief Lebanese leaders on Christopher's latest 
talks in Syria and Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 The visit was the first by a senior U.S. envoy to Lebanon in more than a year 
and underlined Washington's interest in advancing Lebanon-Israel negotiations. 
Those talks stalled after negotiations between Israel and Syria, Lebanon's de 
facto power, broke down in February.

JUSTICES TO RULE ON LEGALITY OF RACIAL GERRYMANDERING; JUDICIARY: WHITE VOTERS, 
ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTH, ARE CHALLENGING BLACK-MAJORITY DISTRICTS. CASE WILL 
HAVE PROFOUND IMPLICATIONS FOR CIVIL RIGHTS AND POLITICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court, acting in a Louisiana case with far-reaching implications 
for civil rights and politics, said Friday that it would rule on whether the 
Constitution allows lawmakers to use the race of voters as a criterion for 
drawing electoral boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of race criteria, which occurred largely because 1982 amendments to 
the Voting Rights Act were read as requiring officials to give minorities 
fairer representation, was largely responsible for the election of a record 
number of blacks and Latinos to Congress in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials, using data from the 1990 census, had redrawn electoral 
boundaries for government at all levels with the intent of creating one or more 
districts with a majority of blacks or Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, several Southern states, including North Carolina, South 
Carolina, Florida, Virginia and Alabama, sent their first black representative 
to Congress in this century.  
</P>
<P>
 But this "racial gerrymandering" has sparked a sharp backlash, particularly in 
the South. White voters have filed lawsuits in virtually every state, 
challenging the oddly shaped districts as unconstitutional. Agreeing, federal 
judges in Louisiana, Texas and Georgia have struck down black-majority 
districts in the last year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the Supreme Court announced that it would review the broadest of 
all the rulings: a declaration by a three-judge panel in Louisiana that outlaws 
"race-conscious decision-making" in drawing electoral boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration lawyers had filed an appeal in the case, now known as 
U.S. vs. Hays, 94-558, arguing that state officials should be permitted to draw 
majority-minority districts so as to give black voters "a realistic opportunity 
to elect a candidate of their choice." 
</P>
<P>
 If the ruling is affirmed, "it would roll back just about all the progress 
that has been made since 1965 in electing more blacks," said Laughlin McDonald, 
director of the Southern regional office of the American Civil Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Supreme Court case concerns a congressional district, its 
constitutional ruling will apply to district boundaries for all manner of 
elected governing boards, including state legislatures, county boards of 
supervisors, city councils and school boards. 
</P>
<P>
 McLaughlin noted that more than 90% of black state legislators were elected 
from majority-black districts, as were all 17 black members of Congress elected 
from the South. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Supreme Court on a 5-4 vote revived a white voter's lawsuit 
that challenged a bizarre-looking, majority-black district in North Carolina. 
But in that case, Shaw vs. Reno, the justices did not make clear whether all 
"race-conscious" districts were unconstitutional, or just those that had a 
highly peculiar shape. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The issue shows all signs of splitting Democrats and their traditional allies 
in the civil rights movements. Some Democratic political activists have 
complained that the newly drawn districts aided the Republicans last month 
because they drained away minority voters from normally Democratic-leaning 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the NAACP Legal Defense and Education Fund derided this analysis as 
scapegoating and issued a report asserting that the Democrats lost control in 
the House because of a decided shift to the right by white voters, not because 
of a racial change in several districts. 
</P>
<P>
 White voters challenging the new districts say they violate the fundamental 
premise that the government should not segregate voters by race. 
</P>
<P>
 "We shouldn't be in the business of fixing elections by race," said Paul Hurd, 
a Monroe, La., attorney who filed the suit challenging a second majority-black 
district in Louisiana. He said the racial line-drawing has created polarized 
voters in the state's seven congressional districts.  
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case early next year and issue a 
ruling by July.

U.N. MAY STAY IN BOSNIA, ENVOY SAYS; TROOPS: AKASHI, CITING HUMANITARIAN 
EFFORTS, SAYS PEACEKEEPER WITHDRAWAL IS ONLY ONE OPTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The head of the U.N. Protection Force sought Friday to halt the steamrollering 
drive for a withdrawal of peacekeepers from Bosnia-Herzegovina, vowing that "we 
have to carry on" despite warnings from troop-contributing countries that the 
mission is dangerously deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as Yasushi Akashi, the U.N. special envoy for the Balkans, played 
down the harassment and hazards that Bosnian Serbs have heaped on U.N. forces, 
military officials of the 24,000-strong peacekeeping force in Bosnia were 
seeking an escape route for 600 Bangladeshi soldiers being hounded out of the 
embattled Bihac pocket in northwest Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview one day after Washington promised thousands of U.S. troops to 
help break U.N. peacekeepers out of the unraveling Balkan conflict, Akashi 
suggested that the mission is unlikely to pull out because it performs 
lifesaving humanitarian work in delivering food to 2 million civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Atlantic Treaty Organization could learn to live with the threat of 
new surface-to-air missiles endangering its aircraft, he suggested, rejecting 
NATO appeals to destroy the proliferating missile systems with air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "NATO is our instrument," Akashi said of the alliance's recent reduction of 
enforcement flights over Bosnia. The U.N. mission asked for fewer flights to 
avoid further incidents in which Bosnian Serbs have locked on to NATO aircraft 
with radar or fired missiles at the planes. 
</P>
<P>
 He praised the U.S. promise of assistance with any pullout of U.N. forces as a 
show of solidarity among Western allies but said that "withdrawal is not more 
than one contingency." 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, Defense Secretary William J. Perry said that if the United 
States sends ground troops to help evacuate U.N. peacekeepers in Bosnia, they 
will be heavily enough armed to use "overwhelming force" and prepared for 
"combat operations" if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going in with a token force -- we'll want to go in with a strong 
enough force that will command respect," Perry told a press conference at the 
Pentagon. "The best way of avoiding problems is having a strong enough force 
that nobody sees it as an inviting target." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that if the allies were to launch an actual evacuation effort, 
both the allied forces and the U.N. peacekeeping troops would be placed under 
NATO command to simplify the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry also said the Clinton Administration would consult fully with Congress 
before sending any U.S. troops to help evacuate U.N. peacekeeping forces in 
Bosnia but would not seek formal authorization from the lawmakers, despite 
calls to that effect from Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has offered to provide at least half of the 45,000 NATO 
troops expected to be needed if the U.N. Security Council orders a full 
retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the U.N. forces in Bosnia are deployed to Serbian-encircled 
enclaves such as Bihac, making them vulnerable to further instances of 
hostage-taking if the Serbs fear that withdrawal will lead to a lifting of the 
U.N. arms embargo on the Muslim-led Bosnian government. 
</P>
<P>
 The troops could also face blockades of angry Bosnian civilians who might fear 
a U.N. pullout would leave them at the mercy of the heavily armed Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, rebels fired at least three heavy artillery shells into central 
Bihac, an area supposedly protected by the U.N. forces, stepping up their 
assault on the "safe area" and drawing fresh international condemnation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are gravely concerned about this attack on civilians in a well-defined 
safe area," mission spokesman Paul Risley said. 
</P>
<P>
 One Bosnian civilian was killed and seven hurt in the attack, he said. U.N. 
officials had no information on casualties from 204 other artillery rounds 
fired by Bosnian and Croatian Serbs into the Bihac region. 
</P>
<P>
 As fighting intensified around Bihac, the first serious effort to extract half 
of the poorly equipped Bangladeshis from that Serbian-encircled war zone hit a 
major obstacle when Croatian Serbs demanded that any departing peacekeepers 
leave in armored vehicles and carry a gun each. The entire 1,200-troop 
battalion has only 300 weapons to defend themselves and the 200,000 Bosnian 
Muslims they were deployed to protect. 
</P>
<P>
 A military communique from mission headquarters to the U.N. peacekeeping chief 
in New York deemed the Croatian Serb conditions for a partial withdrawal 
"unacceptable" because they would "reduce further the operational effectiveness 
of the Bangladesh battalion." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bangladeshis were deployed in mid-October after a hasty withdrawal by the 
French battalion that had been stationed around Bihac. 
</P>
<P>
 Akashi's expression of the need for the United Nations to continue its mission 
despite the current difficulties was echoed in Essen, Germany, where German 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl is hosting a summit of the European Union.  
</P>
<P>
 According to the news agency Reuters, Joachim Bitterlich, Kohl's top foreign 
policy adviser, said that more than half of the member countries had stressed 
the need for the U.N. force to carry on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found an astonishing agreement around the table that UNPROFOR had important 
tasks to do, that it was crucially important they were there," Danish Foreign 
Minister Niels Helveg Petersen said.

YELTSIN AUTHORIZES FORCE AGAINST RESTIVE CHECHENS AS WAR LOOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin authorized the use of force against the 
breakaway republic of Chechnya on Friday, instructing his government to use 
"all means at the state's disposal" to restore order. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian soldiers are massed along the border of the tiny Caucasus Mountain 
republic, and Russian warplanes have been flying over Grozny, the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's presidential decree accused unspecified militias in Chechnya of 
"causing bloodshed, taking lives and violating the rights of Russian Federation 
citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 He called for the use of "all means at the state's disposal" to subdue these 
"illegal armed groups." In Grozny, people braced for war. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow has long portrayed the government of Chechen President Dzhokar M. 
Dudayev as a criminal regime and the forces loyal to him as gangsters and 
terrorists. It wants Dudayev out and refuses to recognize Chechen independence, 
which Dudayev declared in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Yeltsin's decree did not say what "means" his government would use, 
the threat of force was clear. 
</P>
<P>
 The decree was a reversal of Yeltsin's earlier statements that using force in 
Chechnya was out of the question.

NEWS ANALYSIS; MILOSEVIC SIGNATURE SEEN IN SERBS' GAINS; BALKANS: BELGRADE 
MASTERMIND 'RECONCILES' WITH REBELS AS DREAM OF GREATER SERBIA IS ON THE VERGE 
OF COMING TRUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 First there was the appearance throughout Bosnia-Herzegovina of antiaircraft 
missile batteries that Western military sources said had come from Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was U.N. confirmation of Yugoslav aid to Croatian Serb rebels, who 
in turn were openly collaborating with Bosnian Serbs in the month-old assault 
on Muslims in Bihac, the besieged enclave in the northwestern corner of Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Bosnian Serb politicians whose spurning of an international peace plan 
caused a highly publicized rift with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic 
earlier this year are suddenly heeding his advice that the proposal provides a 
"good basis for negotiation." 
</P>
<P>
 After months of diplomatic bickering that has masked military collaboration on 
the ground, Serbs throughout the Balkans have conveniently mended fences to 
take advantage of the international community's indecisiveness over Bosnia, 
sensing that their dream of a Greater Serbia is on the verge of coming true. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials, NATO sources and Western diplomats say the fine hand of 
Belgrade -- the capital of the new Yugoslavia, which consists of Serbia and 
Montenegro -- is increasingly visible in the latest Balkan violence. They say 
they fear that Milosevic has been maneuvering his Bosnian and Croatian Serb 
pawns in a clever end game. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a good chance he's been double-dealing and is involved in the Bihac 
stuff," one senior diplomat said, observing that while the evidence is not 
conclusive, "I'm suspicious as hell." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. special envoy for the Balkans, Yasushi Akashi, said he is not as 
convinced as others of a grand conspiracy among the Serbs to expand their state 
against the will of the world. But asked if Milosevic is playing peacemaker as 
a smoke screen to cover his followers' determined land-grabbing, Akashi 
conceded, "He may be." 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the following incidents that indicate Yugoslav Serb involvement or 
orchestration of the latest violence racking the region: 
</P>
<P>
 * When a Croatian Serb helicopter crashed during a bombing run over Bihac in 
late November, the dead pilot was identified as a native and resident of 
Serbia. 
</P>
<P>
 * Paramilitary thugs who detained and beat two Western photographers over the 
last week, American Ron Jacques and Frenchman Luc Delahaye, identified 
themselves as Serbs from Belgrade and wore the insignia of an elite commando 
squad loyal to Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
 * When Milosevic had the chance last month to have all U.N. sanctions lifted 
from his country by simply recognizing the prewar borders of Bosnia and 
Croatia, he refused. 
</P>
<P>
 * Despite Belgrade's claims to have imposed a blockade against Bosnian Serbs 
for their refusal to endorse the international peace plan, SA-2, SA-3 and SA-6 
surface-to-air missile batteries have made their way from Yugoslav army stocks 
across the allegedly sealed Bosnian border and are now capable of shooting down 
aircraft from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization over at least 40% of 
Bosnian terrain. 
</P>
<P>
 * Belgrade claims to have cut the fuel line to the Bosnian Serbs, whose tanks 
were said to have ground to a halt last month. Yet convoys of fuel tankers 
listed as "transit" deliveries for Croatian Serbs are allowed through 
Serbian-occupied Bosnia by U.N. sanctions monitors, even though the two Serbian 
rebel factions are known to be collaborating in the assault on Bihac. 
</P>
<P>
 * U.N. officials confirm that when Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev 
visited Belgrade last month he met not only Milosevic but also Bosnian Serb 
army chieftain Gen. Ratko Mladic, suggesting that the Serbian president's 
alleged break with Bosnian Serbs has been a ruse. 
</P>
<P>
 * A delegation from the intransigent Bosnian Serb parliament visited Belgrade 
a few days ago to meet with Milosevic and express interest in resuming peace 
talks with the five-nation Contact Group -- the United States, Russia, Britain, 
France and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 * Diplomatic sources say they have intelligence to suggest that Croatian Serb 
troops have moved through Yugoslav territory to deploy in Bosnia to help with 
the assault on Bihac. Yugoslav army helicopters also have been spotted ferrying 
supplies to Bosnian Serb troops in the east of the republic. 
</P>
<P>
 The reconciliation of Milosevic with his Bosnian Serb proxies, if they were 
ever truly estranged, comes as foreign mediators seem most desperate to stifle 
the Balkan crisis with a paper settlement and when all the Serbs have in view 
are carrots, not sticks. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia has demanded that the U.N. Security Council lift all punitive sanctions 
levied against Yugoslavia for fomenting the Bosnian crisis, arguing that 
Milosevic is doing everything he can to bring about peace. 
</P>
<P>
 France and Britain, fearful for their thousands of soldiers serving as U.N. 
peacekeepers in Bosnia, have tried to entice Bosnian Serbs back to negotiations 
by hinting that the rebels could annex their conquered territory to Yugoslavia 
in a Serbian confederation. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States had previously rejected any premature rewarding of Serbia 
for no longer blatantly inciting Bosnian violence, insisting that sanctions 
should be eased only after the Bosnian Serbs agree to a negotiated peace. But 
senior U.S. officials have lately been proclaiming that unity within the NATO 
alliance and good relations with Russia are more important than a just Bosnian 
peace deal, signaling that Washington may bow to European pressures to craft a 
settlement acceptable to the Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an example of appeasement creating appetites rather than sating them, 
Bosnian Serbs have recently upped the ante for compliance, demanding that NATO 
abandon protective air patrols over Bosnian skies. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. ambassador to Croatia, Peter Galbraith, deemed the evidence of 
pan-Serbian collaboration "very serious" after hearing the brutal details of 
the torture of the two photographers, who were beaten, subjected to a mock 
execution and doused with water and left in the cold. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other Western diplomats have expressed fear that Milosevic has again duped 
foreign mediators into offering further concessions for the Serbs at the 
expense of Bosnian Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been comfortable with the Contact Group's approach of dealing with 
Milosevic as a man of peace," one envoy said. "Some people are too quick to 
forget how this whole thing got started." 
</P>
<P>
 Milosevic rose to power as head of the Serbian Communist Party by whipping up 
nationalist passions over the predominantly Albanian province of Kosovo and 
arming Croatian and Bosnian Serbs prior to their land grabs. 
</P>
<P>
 If the assault on Bihac eventually succeeds and the last government-held 
pocket of northwestern Bosnia falls, Bosnian Serbs will hold more than 80% of 
the republic and will provide a supportive bulwark along the length of the 
Serbian-occupied territory in Croatia, making it difficult, if not impossible, 
for Zagreb ever to reassert its authority over its lost land. 
</P>
<P>
 And with the international community's current offer of "confederal rights" 
for the Bosnian Serb holdouts and the unbreakable grip that they would have on 
occupied Croatian territory as a result, a Greater Serbia would be virtually 
achieved.

 A Cuban radio news anchor asked for political asylum upon arriving to cover 
the Summit of the Americas, saying he could no longer tolerate the repression 
of his homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Santana Ojeda, who said he was the anchor of a daily economic news talk 
show called "Clearly Speaking," said Friday that he was unable to resist a 
"once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to get out." He sought asylum upon arrival at 
Miami International Airport late Thursday. 
</P>

 Cuba is the only Western Hemisphere nation not invited to the 34-nation summit 
convened to outline a program of free trade and economic development.

SUMMIT NATIONS BOAST OF AGREEMENT, BUT FRICTIONS TEAR AT HAPPY FACADE; 
AMERICAS: DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN U.S. AND ITS LATIN NEIGHBORS THREATEN TO WATER 
DOWN CONCLAVE'S FINAL DECLARATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 "Agreement" is the happy buzzword at the Summit of the Americas in Miami, but 
nagging differences persist between the United States and its Latin American 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Latin American countries declined to include an extensive U.S. 
anti-narcotics proposal in the summit's final documents, to be approved Sunday. 
A political analyst from the region said officials of Bolivia, Peru and 
Colombia "hit the ceiling" when the State Department made the tough proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The three countries are the main producers of cocaine, and they have long been 
at odds with the United States over how best to stop trafficking of the illegal 
drug. Jaime Aparicio, an official of Bolivia's Foreign Ministry, said Friday 
that the U.S. document contained proposals that were unacceptable, such as 
using chemical herbicides. 
</P>
<P>
 Aparicio said the document also proposed no increase in U.S. aid for 
"alternative development" to reduce farmers' dependence on crops of coca leaf, 
the raw material of cocaine. This is one of many points of disagreement between 
Washington and Latin American countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Others include illegal immigration, labor and environmental standards and 
trade protectionism. While governments have agreed on a declaration of harmony 
and accord, friction has been frequent in pre-summit negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are differences on each one of the items of the agenda," said Gert 
Rosenthal, who heads the U.N. Economic Commission for Latin America and the 
Caribbean. "You could probably say there is broad agreement, but if you go down 
the list one by one, there are differences on each one." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the final declarations will contain many watered-down versions of 
punchier points proposed in preparatory meetings. Open bickering will be 
avoided, but hemispheric harmony will be far from complete. 
</P>
<P>
 In their most resounding decision, the 34 presidents and prime ministers 
meeting here will agree to work for hemispheric free trade. In negotiations 
over wording of that agreement, however, Latin Americans resisted U.S. efforts 
to link labor and environment standards to the trade issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Without such "linkage," many Democrats in Congress may have trouble selling 
the idea of hemispheric free trade to their pro-labor and pro-environment 
constituencies. Many Latin American governments, on the other hand, contend 
that hard-to-meet standards on these issues could be a barrier to progress 
toward free trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration is another source of anger for several of the summit participants. 
Mexico and the Central American countries plan to protest what they see as an 
anti-immigrant backlash in the United States. They want a formal condemnation 
of California's Proposition 187, which denies education and other public 
services to illegal immigrants.  
</P>
<P>
 "It (Proposition 187) is a flagrant and massive violation of human rights, 
especially for children," Guatemalan President Ramiro de Leon Carpio said upon 
arriving here. 
</P>
<P>
 In another potential clash with the Clinton Administration, the Central 
Americans hope to link trade and immigration. To stop the flow of illegal 
immigrants north, they will argue, the United States must give preferential 
treatment to Central American products, such as textiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, these governments maintain, Central America's tiny economies, which 
in some cases are still recovering from U.S.-backed wars, cannot compete and 
will not be able to provide the jobs to keep citizens at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States is going to have to realize that if they don't want 
(illegal) immigrants, they are going to have to become a partner in progress 
for our people," said President Armando Calderon Sol of El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
 Both El Salvador and Nicaragua will be seeking special dispensation for their 
refugees who live in the United States. Nicaraguan President Violeta Barrios de 
Chamorro will ask President Clinton to extend the visas of about 100,000 
Nicaraguans who were granted temporary permission to live in the United States 
during Nicaragua's civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar program that gave temporary haven to tens of thousands of 
Salvadorans expires at the end of the month, and Clinton last week refused 
Salvadoran government requests for an extension. Calderon Sol indicated that he 
will raise the issue again. 
</P>
<P>
 Another high-sounding summit conclusion will call for efforts to strengthen 
democracy, which has been trampled in the past by numerous Latin American 
dictatorships. While none of the leaders at the summit took power by force, 
Latin American governments blocked a U.S. proposal for measures to defend 
democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States wanted more forceful language," Rosenthal said. "The Latin 
Americans had no substantive difference with it, but it sounded as if the 
United States was going to have a role in monitoring political development." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though "anti-imperialism" in the region has faded since the end of the 
Cold War, governments remain sensitive to any hint of domineering behavior by 
Washington. Meddling by the United States, the CIA and other U.S. operatives in 
Latin domestic affairs, such as the backing of Contra insurgents in Nicaragua 
during the 1980s, is a fresh memory for many Latins. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, some analysts say, if the Clinton Administration had made a forceful 
invasion of Haiti instead of a brokered entry to restore elected government in 
September, many presidents might have refused to attend the summit in protest. 
</P>
<P>
 While free trade is the central theme of the summit, trade disagreements with 
the United States abound. Latin American countries that export steel, garments, 
leather goods, flowers and other products to the United States bridle at U.S. 
regulations that result in "countervailing duties" on imports that are judged 
to be subsidized. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Argentina and other agricultural exporters complain that subsidized 
U.S. farm products compete unfairly on world markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. embargo against Communist Cuba is another divisive issue. Several 
countries, including Mexico, Costa Rica and Colombia, support dialogue with 
Cuba, rather than isolation, as a way to bring about democratic change. They 
will urge flexibility on the embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 But Eduardo Gamarra, a political scientist at Miami's Florida International 
University, said nothing causes more trouble between the United States and 
Latin America than narcotics. U.S. pressure on governments to take drastic 
measures against drug production and trafficking is resented, and also 
ineffective. Senior U.S. officials have gone so far as to accuse the president 
of Colombia, Ernesto Samper, of accepting drug money in his election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's more cocaine coming to the United States than ever before, and 
there's more corruption than ever before," Gamarra said. "This is still the 
primary bone of contention between the United States and Latin America."

BUDGET-CUTTING BECOMES A BLOOD SPORT; GOVERNMENT: BOTH PARTIES ARE OUT TO 
DRASTICALLY SLASH FEDERAL SPENDING AND TAXES. DEMOCRATS NOW TOUT 
ONCE-UNTHINKABLE PLANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A year ago, when an obscure Ohio Republican lawmaker crafted a bipartisan 
congressional coalition to support steep federal spending cuts that went far 
beyond those called for by the Clinton Administration, the White House narrowly 
defeated the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton and his advisers argued that the Clinton budget was already 
so austere that further cuts would slow the economy. The White House was also 
so committed to increased spending for certain "public investments" -- such as 
job training, education and public housing -- that the Administration didn't 
believe it was possible to meet Clinton's pledge to provide tax relief for 
middle-class Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, however, that obscure Republican, Rep. John R. Kasich, is poised to 
become chairman of the House Budget Committee. And Clinton is scrambling to 
develop a new, more conservative approach to governing to match the tax cuts 
and spending reductions Kasich and his party hope to enact. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Kasich's rise to power is symbolic of the change that has hit 
Washington. Republicans and Democrats alike now are contemplating proposals to 
alter economic and budget policy that would have been unthinkable just a few 
months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican sweep in the November elections has convinced both sides that a 
new political consensus has emerged in favor of harsh spending cuts, sweeping 
tax reductions and a diminishment of the role the federal government plays in 
society. 
</P>
<P>
 That new conservative mood was captured clearly Friday by Sen. Bob Kerrey 
(D-Neb.) as he proposed a package of deficit-cutting measures -- including 
cutting Social Security taxes, requiring workers to open private retirement 
accounts and raising the age for full retirement and Medicare benefits to 70 -- 
during a public debate at the Bipartisan Commission on Entitlement and Tax 
Reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrey made it clear that he believes Americans are ready for tough measures. 
"We have an obligation to ourselves, our children and future generations to 
leave them a nation whose fiscal and economic health gives them an opportunity 
to pursue their dreams. We have to bring entitlement spending into balance." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration finds itself open to such thinking as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President has made it clear that he wants bold measures" presented to him 
in the budget process, a senior Administration official said. As a result, 
officials say Clinton is finally poised to approve a modest middle-class tax 
cut, paid for through new spending cutbacks and restructuring in federal 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 If Clinton does announce such a tax cut, it will be done with offsetting 
spending cuts so as not to worsen the budget deficit, Administration officials 
stressed. The Administration has not yet decided the exact size or form of its 
tax break, but officials say they are likely to propose cuts of about $30 
billion targeted for working families with children.  
</P>
<P>
 The Administration is also scouring the government for some highly visible 
programs or agencies to eliminate or consolidate -- steps that would steal some 
thunder from the Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 While Administration officials dismiss reports that a large Cabinet department 
like Housing and Urban Development might be broken up, other sources suggest 
that smaller agencies, like the Interstate Commerce Commission, might be 
targeted for elimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Such actions would come in addition to the Administration's ongoing 
Reinventing Government program, which already calls for the elimination of 
272,000 federal jobs. So far, about 75,000 of that number have been cut. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the coming budget plan -- to be unveiled by the White House in February 
-- will be the least significant of the three issued so far by the Clinton 
Administration because the Republican-controlled Congress plans to reject it in 
favor of its own tax and spending blueprints. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Clinton budget retains at least symbolic importance as an indicator 
of Clinton's goals. "The President wants us to develop an agenda that we 
believe is right, one that is an expression of our beliefs," even if the 
Republicans ignore it, one Administration official noted. 
</P>
<P>
 In the House, Republicans are committed to vote instead for their "contract 
with America," which calls for at least $147 billion in tax cuts over five 
years, partially financed with at least $40 billion in reductions in welfare 
and related poverty programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The most significant cuts are a 50% reduction in the capital gains tax rate, 
plus a plan to index capital gains for inflation and a proposal for a 
$500-per-child tax credit for middle-class families. The Republicans' 
middle-class tax cut will almost certainly turn out to be larger than the one 
Clinton will propose. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The "contract with America" itself does not include enough spending cuts to 
either pay for its tax cuts or comply with the requirements of the contract's 
proposal for a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. But Kasich is 
privately developing a new Republican alternative budget that will include 
specific spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 The starting point for that effort comes from Kasich's plan, introduced last 
March, to reduce federal spending by $150 billion more over five years than 
Clinton had proposed. In addition to cuts in welfare, Medicaid and other 
poverty programs, that Kasich plan also proposed reductions or vast changes in 
a wide range of programs that are popular with the middle class, farmers and 
powerful senior citizen groups -- such as Medicare, agriculture subsidies, 
Amtrak funding and small business and housing loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding for virtually all of Clinton's so-called "investment" agenda would be 
either scaled back or eliminated.  
</P>
<P>
 But as the Republicans search for enough spending cuts to pay for their own 
agenda, senior Administration officials are bemused to see them considering the 
same cuts that the White House pondered last year -- and ultimately abandoned 
for lack of Republican support.  
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the things they are now considering are things that we considered 
including in the Reinventing Government plan, but we decided not to include 
because we couldn't find any Republicans who would join us to endorse them," 
noted Laura D'Andrea Tyson, head of the Council of Economic Advisers at the 
White House.

<P>
 Three sailors were missing after a Ukrainian cargo ship sank Friday in a storm 
on the North Atlantic, leaving some crew members clinging to debris amid 
30-foot-high waves and 50-m.p.h. winds. 
</P>
<P>
 The crew of the Salvador Allende was not expected to be rescued until at least 
this morning because of the weather, said Lt. Jim Tabor of the U.S. Coast Guard 
in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen members of the mostly Ukrainian crew were in the water clinging to 
debris, 11 were in a lifeboat and three were missing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two merchant vessels and a Canadian military airplane were on the scene Friday 
night, but the weather prevented them from reaching survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 More ships and helicopters were on the way. Visibility at the scene was 
estimated at one mile. 
</P>
<P>
 The ship began taking on water Thursday night and sank early Friday 750 miles 
southeast of Halifax, Nova Scotia. It was bound for Helsinki, Finland, from 
Texas with a cargo of rice. 
</P>
<P>
 Coast Guard airplanes dropped radios and emergency supplies to the survivors.

FAA BANS ATR FLIGHTS IN ICY CONDITIONS; SAFETY: ORDER COMES SIX WEEKS AFTER 
FATAL CRASH IN MIDWEST. MANUFACTURER PROVIDES NEW INFORMATION ABOUT POSSIBLE 
HAZARDS IN BAD WEATHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Aviation Administration, shifting its position of a week ago, 
ordered an immediate ban Friday on U.S. airline flights of ATR commuter 
aircraft when icy weather is present or forecast. The order came six weeks 
after one of the European-made planes crashed as it approached Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 FAA Administrator David Hinson said the grounding order was based on new 
information from the French-Italian consortium that makes the twin-engine 
turboprop aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Affected by the ban are 156 short-haul aircraft in the United States operated 
mainly by American Eagle, Continental Express and Trans World Express. The 
planes, with maximum ranges of 350 to 400 miles, are produced by Avions de 
Transport Regional in two configurations, the ATR-42, which generally has 46 
seats, and the ATR-72, with 68 seats. 
</P>
<P>
 "The FAA has been working day and night to develop any information about this 
(Oct. 31) accident," Hinson told reporters. "The information we have now 
accumulated calls for immediate and direct action." 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA insisted that ATRs are still safe in good weather. But officials said 
that new information from the manufacturer about the possible hazards of icy 
conditions showed that control could be lost in certain situations. 
</P>
<P>
 ATR, however, issued a statement late Friday arguing that its tests "provide 
no bases for the action taken by the FAA today." 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it had voluntarily conducted rigorous tests and they 
"reconfirmed the full compliance of the ATR aircraft with the certification 
requirements set by the FAA." The company said it continues to have full 
confidence "in its aircrafts' ability to operate safely in all weather, 
including icing conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Line Pilots Assn., many of whose members had balked at flying ATRs 
since the fatal crash near Roselawn, Ind., promptly endorsed Hinson's action, 
calling it "justified and appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 "ATR pilots should continue to exercise their command authority and avoid 
icing conditions," the association said. 
</P>
<P>
 A week ago the FAA held a news briefing to assure the public that ATRs were 
safe despite the crash that killed 68 persons.  
</P>
<P>
 "While some pilots have expressed concern about flying ATR aircraft, the FAA 
would not permit continuing operations of this aircraft if we believed the 
aircraft was unsafe," Linda Daschle, deputy FAA administrator, said at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the cause of the Roselawn crash has not yet been determined, the 
National Transportation Safety Board, which is investigating the accident, had 
recommended imposing flight restrictions for certain weather conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 FAA officials said Friday's directive supplants a previous FAA order issued 
Nov. 16 that prohibited the operation of the ATR autopilot mechanism during 
icing conditions or in moderate or greater turbulence. The agency also had 
recommended, but not ordered, that ATRs not be flown in bad weather until the 
cause of the crash was determined. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, American Eagle, an affiliate of American Airlines, had been 
facing public relations problems made worse by the reluctance of pilots to fly 
the planes in cold, rainy conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the FAA's assurances a week ago, the International Airline Passengers 
Assn. had urged its members to avoid traveling in ATR aircraft until the FAA 
took the step it decided upon Friday -- prohibiting operation of the planes in 
known or reported icing conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's order, called an emergency airworthiness directive, came just 
two weeks before the busy Christmas travel period. But some travel agencies 
said airlines operating the affected planes have other aircraft to which they 
could shift their passengers, and thus they did not expect any major tie-ups. 
</P>
<P>
 American Eagle bases most of its ATR aircraft in Chicago, and Continental 
chiefly uses them at its Newark, N.J., hub. Airline officials said they planned 
to move the aircraft south as winter approaches.  
</P>
<P>
 Some aviation authorities said that until the October accident, ATR aircraft 
were generally recognized as superior planes with a good safety record and good 
fuel efficiency. They had proved popular with U.S. operators, handling 7% of 
shorter-run regional flights and 15% of regional seat capacity.  
</P>
<P>
 But experts now say that the ATR's smaller, fuel-efficient wings and tail may 
be especially susceptible to icing. In icing conditions, water remains a liquid 
in the air until it encounters a surface on which it can freeze. Airplanes 
often provide such a surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Ice buildup can disrupt airflow over flight surfaces such as wings and can 
cause them to lose lift.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; COLLATERAL SALES REVEAL MURKINESS OF BANKRUPTCY 
LAW; FINANCE: CHAPTER 9, LARGELY UNTESTED UNTIL NOW, IS SUPPOSED TO PRESERVE 
THE STATUS QUO. BUT A 1984 AMENDMENT EXEMPTS 'REVERSE REPOS,' WHICH ORANGE 
COUNTY FUND USED, IN CORPORATE CASES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The cash is gone. The judge is out of town. The county isn't saying much. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapter 9 of the federal Bankruptcy Code was supposed to provide an orderly 
shelter for financially beleaguered municipalities such as Orange County. But 
in its first real test, some experts think the law has been found wanting. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of a bankruptcy is to preserve the status quo and permit a 
reasonable resolution of massive financial problems. But Orange County's status 
quo was badly shaken by Wall Street's liquidation of $11.4 billion of the 
county's bond holdings this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the county "has to try to unscramble the omelet," said Loyola University 
law professor Daniel Schechter. 
</P>
<P>
 Scrambled is a good word to describe the legal picture as Orange County ends 
its first week in bankruptcy protection. Several legal experts said the outcome 
of the county's gamble on a Chapter 9 filing is far from clear, because there 
really are no precedents. 
</P>
<P>
 The collateral calls by Wall Street -- in which investment houses sold bonds 
they held to cover the county's unpaid loans -- are just one indication of the 
lack of clarity. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the law is so murky, some legal analysts were surprised that Orange 
County had not asked a bankruptcy judge for an injunction specifically barring 
such liquidation sales, rather than simply relying on the normal "stay" 
provisions of the bankruptcy law. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the county Friday sued Nomura Securities -- one of the brokerages 
that sold its collateral -- and pledged to sue others as it gathers sufficient 
data. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because there are always questions" about the scope of a bankruptcy's 
automatic stay provisions, "it's not uncommon for the debtor to ask the judge 
for an additional injunction," said University of Texas law professor Jay 
Westbrook. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce S. Bennett, Orange County's lead bankruptcy lawyer, said he could not 
comment on this issue without divulging confidential attorney-client 
discussions. He also declined comment when asked whether there are problems 
with the operation of Chapter 9. Bennett said the county is moving on a number 
of legal fronts beyond court actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court proceedings are important, but not necessarily the most important 
thing," Bennett said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "My objective for this case is to find practical solutions to the problems and 
have them implemented with a minimum of discord," he said. "What's happening 
outside the courtroom is very often more important than what is going on in the 
courtroom." 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, Nomura declared that the county's suit was "baseless and 
without merit," and pledged to defend itself "vigorously." And a lawyer 
representing a New York investment bank that liquidated millions in bonds 
Thursday said Wall Street firms have studied the matter and are "confident we 
will prevail on the legal issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Westbrook and Schechter said two fundamental public policy issues appear to be 
at war in the current situation. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand, the purpose of allowing a debtor to file for bankruptcy is to 
freeze the status quo so there can be an orderly disposition of conflicting 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the bankruptcy law was specifically amended in 1984 to make 
repurchase agreements on government bonds and certain other instruments -- 
popularly known as reverse repos -- exempt from the law's coverage in corporate 
bankruptcies. 
</P>
<P>
 The law was amended at Wall Street's behest after industry lobbyists convinced 
Congress that this exemption was needed to aid the free flow of capital, said 
Omaha bankruptcy lawyer Harry Dixon, former counsel to the Senate Judiciary 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 When Congress exempted repurchase agreements from the coverage of corporate 
bankruptcy law, "who would have thought that a county would be dabbling in 
reverse repos," Dixon said. It was reverse-repo transactions that allowed 
Orange County to boost its investment portfolio to almost triple the sum 
invested by local agencies -- and that caused the fund to deflate as interest 
rates rose and the bond holdings' value fell. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston bankruptcy lawyer Hugh Ray, head of the American Bar Assn.'s business 
bankruptcy committee, said that the controversy will not have a quick solution 
and that the battle could go all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Westbrook warned that without strict limits on creditors' actions once a 
bankruptcy is filed, the supposed protection of the court is of limited value. 
</P>
<P>
 "To the extent that certain types of transactions are exempted from the 
automatic stay, the whole idea of bankruptcy becomes problematic," he said. 
"This exemption swallows an awful lot of the law. Some of the most important 
benefits are lost by these exemptions." 
</P>
<P>
 All that appears clear at present is that there may be a bonanza for lawyers, 
because there are disputes on even the simplest of concepts. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, what does it mean to "preserve the status quo" in a situation 
like this? 
</P>
<P>
 Robert J. Rosenberg, a prominent New York City bankruptcy lawyer, said that if 
the brokerages had not acted, the status quo would have been unalterably 
changed for them because the crisis was driving down the value of their 
holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 "If sales are frozen, that shifts the risk of the future ups and downs of the 
securities from the county to the house holding the security," Rosenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schechter said the basic purpose of Chapter 9 clearly was to prevent the 
sort of fire sales that occurred Thursday. If they are permitted to stand, he 
said, that would significantly erode the power of Chapter 9 as a meaningful 
tool to protect financially troubled governmental entities. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the context of a municipality, it's not all clear to me from a policy 
standpoint that the liquidity of the markets is of paramount concern," 
Schechter said. "It's really a juxtaposition of three strange worlds colliding 
at one small point in Orange County -- municipal insolvency, liquidity of the 
securities market and the specialized world of leveraged securities 
transactions." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are a host of other unanswered questions -- including whether the 
bankruptcy filing was a massive miscalculation. After all, it may have 
precipitated Thursday's sales, which seem to have further endangered Orange 
County's position. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett said people leveling this contention are not aware of all the relevant 
facts. But he declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation is so uncharted that Orange County filed two separate 
bankruptcies, one on behalf of the county and one on behalf of the investment 
fund.  
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts said it is possible that the county decided to take two bites at 
the apple to hedge its bets. If federal bankruptcy Judge John Ryan concludes 
the county is not insolvent, he could throw out its filing. If he concludes the 
fund itself does not qualify as a debtor under Chapter 9, he could throw out 
its filing. The county's hope may be that at least one filing survives. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett declined to respond to that premise. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan, in Santa Ana, who will return from vacation next week to take the reins 
in the case, is likely to be making new law in a series of rulings in coming 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Ryan has a pivotal role, he does not have as much power as a judge 
in a corporate bankruptcy, according to legal experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Chapter 9, the judge is empowered to review the county's plan to reorder 
its affairs, known formally as "a plan of adjustment." If he finds the plan 
unfair, he can reject it. If that happens, the county can modify the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But the judge does not have the power to tell the county that it can no longer 
buy or sell certain kinds of securities. Nor can he take over the operations of 
Orange County or take other actions the way a judge can in a corporate 
bankruptcy by appointing a trustee. 
</P>
<P>
 It also is unclear how rapidly the Orange County proceeding will unfold. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus far, no hearings have been scheduled and there are no deadlines for the 
filing of any legal papers. On Friday, Bennett said it was unclear when the 
first court hearing would be held and how significant the first hearing would 
be when it is held. 
</P>
<P>
 In coming weeks, Orange County will be submitting to the court a list of its 
creditors and how much they are owed. Then the county will be required to 
prepare its plan of adjustment in consultation with the creditors, particularly 
the larger ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, most municipal bankruptcies have been resolved quickly. But none 
has been remotely as large as this one. The biggest previous municipal 
bankruptcy filing was lodged in 1991 by Bridgeport, Conn., which had more than 
$200 million in bond debt, a mere fraction of Orange County's current debt. 
Bridgeport's bankruptcy was dismissed because the county was found to be 
solvent. 
</P>
<P>
 Some skeptics already have raised doubt about whether Orange County is 
insolvent. For an entity to be a Chapter 9 debtor, the law provides that it 
must be insolvent or unable to meet its debts as they mature and that it must 
desire to effect a plan to adjust its debts. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Orange County has been meeting its payroll obligations and paying its 
debts to suppliers, Westbrook said there is a question as to whether it is 
insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, he said that if the county starts to have problems paying debts, the 
question arises as to whether the county should be obligated to raise taxes 
rather than resorting to bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schechter said that if the county does not qualify as a debtor, it will 
become even more difficult to achieve an "orderly untangling of this mess."

 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) Filing for Bankruptcy 
</P>
<P>
 Local governments overwhelmed by debts can seek protection by filing under 
Chapter 9 of the federal bankruptcy code. Approval of a Chapter 9 petition 
rests heavily on the filer's solvency, its creditors' approval and creation of 
a viable plan for paying debts. A federal bankruptcy judge makes the final 
decision. Here are the steps involved: 
</P>
<P>
 1) Bankruptcy petition is filed. 
</P>
<P>
 2) Government agency files a list of creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 3) A creditors' committee is formed. There will be several such committees. 
The judge can rule committees are not needed. 
</P>
<P>
 4) Creditors file claims. A deadline for filing will be set by the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 5) A plan of reorganization takes shape as the petitioner negotiates with 
creditor groups. 
</P>
<P>
 6) The petitioner publishes a plan of reorganization. The plan will classify 
types of creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 7) The court approves a disclosure document describing the reorganization 
proposal and the agency's financial condition. 
</P>
<P>
 8) Creditors vote whether to support the plan no sooner than 20 days -- 
usually a month -- later. For approval, the plan needs a two-thirds majority of 
the creditors (in monetary amount) and a simple majority in number (to protect 
the small creditors), determined by the number of creditors who actually vote. 
</P>
<P>
 9) Judge reviews plan for fairness and can approve or reject it. If rejected, 
the agency can modify the plan and resubmit.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; VOICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many Orange County residents reacted with frustration and anger at the 
county's financial crisis. Here is a sampling of comments received from readers 
invited to telephone the newspaper's TimesLine number with their comments. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I think the Orange County credit problem right now is due to the Proposition 
13. Bob Citron was a hero in the county because his investments paid off so 
well that people didn't have to be threatened by this kind of cash short fall. 
Now the chickens have come home to roost and we're going to have to pay the 
price from our taxes now instead of borrowing money, borrowing spending until 
we get ourselves in such a mess. 
</P>
<P>
 HOWARD CARTWRIGHT,

 ANAHEIM  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 This is complete, total fiscal irresponsibility. Who is responsible? I feel 
it's the entire Orange County government supervisors. It was a lack of 
oversight and absolutely irresponsible for the treasurer to leverage the 
financial accounts so that there is a possibility for the financial system 
going the opposite direction of his bet. It was total greed and outrageous. 
Playing the securities market is not for public funds. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 This is going to have a huge trickle-down effect for everyone in the county, 
and it has a huge effect on financial markets for all municipalities. What led 
to the crisis? Lawyers and politicians lacking enough common sense to have laws 
in place to ensure safe investments are made with the public's money. No public 
money should be able to be used to have a huge margin account. The portfolio 
was invested 3-to-1 on margins and very risky investments. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 I feel that this whole crisis is the responsibility of the Board of 
Supervisors and Mr. Ernie Snyder. I feel Mr. Snyder should be removed from his 
office, he was the overseer to Mr. Citron. All the questions that were raised 
during the election, he never followed up on obviously and the same with the 
Board of Supervisors. They backed Mr. Citron the whole way, not once 
questioning any of his actions.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; AGENTS SUBPOENA DOCUMENTS FROM 2 WALL STREET 
FIRMS; INVESTIGATION: OFFICIALS AT MERRILL LYNCH AND RAUSCHER PIERCE REFSNES 
DENY ANY WRONGDOING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC LICHTBLAU and SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As investigators coast to coast turned up the heat in Orange County's funding 
crisis, two Wall Street firms at the center of the affair confirmed Friday that 
federal agents had served them with subpoenas in one of five ongoing inquiries. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with Merrill Lynch and Rauscher Pierce Refsnes, two investment 
houses involved in Orange County bond deals that have spurred questions about 
whether federal disclosure rules were followed, said they were subpoenaed this 
week by the Securities and Exchange Commission, which demanded company 
documents. Both firms denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, officials with the office of Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi 
said they expect to expand their inquiry into the bond controversy to include 
allegations that former Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert L. Citron may have 
accepted improper gifts from investment firms. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Citron hired an attorney who handles civil and criminal matters, 
but Deputy Dist. Atty. Guy Ormes emphasized that investigators have "no 
evidence of any criminal wrongdoing." 
</P>
<P>
 District attorney's investigators also sought to interview Acting Treasurer 
Mathew R. Raabe at his office Friday, but Raabe declined to speak with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy was cooperative. He was cordial. But he said, 'I want to speak with 
my attorney first,' " one source said. The investigators returned later in the 
day, but Raabe told them he had not yet spoken with a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, sources said the National Assn. of Securities Dealers opened an 
investigation Friday into $3,000 in contributions from three Merrill Lynch 
employees to Citron during his hotly contested reelection campaign earlier this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The NASD probe came in response to charges leveled Thursday by the 
International Brotherhood of Teamsters, alleging that the donations -- 
including one for $1,000 from Merrill Lynch executive Michael Stamenson -- who 
worked with the troubled Orange County investment fund -- violated federal 
policy. The toughened new regulations restrict investors from seeking municipal 
bond contracts for two years after donating to local officeholders or 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 The probes could lead to a wide range of civil and criminal responses if any 
wrongdoing is found. But it already seems clear that investigators are focusing 
on the political and financial relationships between county officials and their 
financial advisers -- and the influence those ties may have had on how county 
bonds were bought and sold. 
</P>
<P>
 The inquiries have left Orange County officials struggling to keep up. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole thing is very taxing," County Counsel Terry C. Andrus said. "It's 
overwhelming and quite distracting, but everyone understands the need for it. 
We're trying to respond to all the (inquiries), but it's a lot. We'll keep up, 
though." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Commodity Futures 
Trading Commission and other agencies have been poring over documents from the 
Hall of Administration all week, and Andrus said he expects "hundreds of 
thousands of pages" to be copied by the time they are done. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the CFTC, which regulates the federal futures market, said 
Friday that commission representatives are reviewing the documents in Orange 
County to determine whether the county portfolio included any futures 
commodities -- and, if so, whether the county met federal regulations for 
reporting the trading of such commodities. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the U.S. attorney's office refused comment on the Orange County 
fund Friday, but sources said no criminal investigation has been opened. 
</P>
<P>
 It was about the only office with a connection to the case that had not opened 
an inquiry. In addition, the state Department of Corporations has launched a 
separate investigation into the relationship between Merrill Lynch and the 
county treasurer's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Securities and Exchange Commission refused to comment on 
their investigation Friday, but the federal agency appears to have taken the 
most aggressive stance in its investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Merrill Lynch and Dallas-based Rauscher Pierce Refsnes refused to 
discuss the contents of the subpoenas they received, but Merrill spokesman 
Timothy Gilles said: "As is our policy, we plan to cooperate fully with the 
SEC." 
</P>
<P>
 B. J. French, a spokeswoman for Rauscher Pierce's parent company, 
Inter-Regional Financial Group, said the subpoena was in connection with the 
SEC's investigation of the Orange County investment pool. She said she had no 
reason to believe that Rauscher is a target of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Both firms underwrote notes issued by Orange County and other investors in the 
pool. The notes' offering statements are said not to have disclosed that the 
investment pool was facing losses. Bond experts say any firm responsible for 
preparing a bond can be held liable if its financial conditions are not 
properly disclosed to investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Merrill Lynch also underwrote a separate note for $600 million that has drawn 
scrutiny, sources said. Again, the questions are said to center on whether 
disclosure rules were followed. 
</P>
<P>
 The taxable note issue was sold in July by Merrill Lynch & Co, with Leifer 
Capital of Santa Monica as financial adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with Leifer Capital refused to say Friday whether they had been 
subpoenaed in the SEC inquiry, but did issue a statement saying the firm, which 
concentrates on structuring municipal bonds, plays little role in actual 
investment choices. 
</P>
<P>
 "The focus of our activities has always been to assist in achieving the best 
rates for our clients," the statement said. "We do not involve ourselves in 
investment decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 A separate issue in the financial disaster, disclosed Friday in The Times, 
centers on Citron's acceptance of meals, a picture frame and other items 
totaling more than $400 from investment firms after a virtual ban on gifts to 
county officials went into effect in June, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Citron has maintained in an interview that the gifts were legal because they 
came from firms which did business for the county retirement system, an 
independent body outside the jurisdiction of the county. Sources in the county 
said they believe the point is a legitimate one, but Ormes said he expected 
prosecutors to look at the issue as part of their inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's an interesting distinction," Ormes said of Citron's explanation. "But 
I sure don't see anything in the gift ban ordinance that excludes something 
like that." 
</P>

report.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; DEPARTMENT HEADS CAN ONLY WORRY AND WAIT; BUDGET: 
AGENCIES ALREADY HARD-PRESSED FOR MONEY SAY FUTURE DEPENDS ON HOW CRISIS IS 
RESOLVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Hiring, travel expenses and other nonessential spending were the first to go. 
But what may be next remained unclear Friday as officials in already-strapped 
Orange County departments anxiously awaited word about possible cutbacks to 
deal with the financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other department heads, county Librarian John M. Adams wondered this week 
what would happen to the library system's budget, its 27 branches already on 
reduced hours and shored up by a number of one-time fixes and emergency 
allocations. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they were hoping to get a clearer picture of the county's 
financial shape next week before deciding what cuts would be needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to find out how much we've got and then we'll do whatever is 
necessary," Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything is going to depend on what type of program is developed to get us 
out of this mess," said Orange County Public Defender Ronald Y. Butler, who 
received 10 new positions earlier this year to defend clients facing lengthy 
sentences under California's new "three strikes" law. Butler had been hoping to 
add more staff in the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure it's going to affect all of us. How much? It's really impossible to 
tell at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's decision this week to seek protection from its creditors comes 
in a fiscal year that had been hailed as the rosiest in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in three years, the Board of Supervisors approved a 
$3.7-billion budget this fall that did not include layoffs or leaving vacant 
positions unfilled. The budget maintained spending at current levels for most 
programs and called for the creation of more than 900 county jobs, nearly half 
of the 2,000 positions cut in past budget crunches. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months county departments received the go-ahead to buy equipment, 
including a $1.25-million short-term service contract for a firefighting 
helicopter, a request made in the wake of the devastating Laguna Beach 
firestorm last year. And the county's innovative, $2-million anti-gang program 
known as Target was among those new programs paid for by the risky -- and 
previously high-profit -- investments made by former county Treasurer-Tax 
Collector Robert L. Citron. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the bankruptcy filing, County Clerk Gary L. Granville said his 
department was considering about $500,000 in cutbacks, mainly through executive 
salaries, as part of the merger of the clerk and recorder's offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Granville said he was unsure how the crisis might affect those plans, and 
noted that funds used for ongoing automation improvements are tied up in the 
investment pool. 
</P>
<P>
 County Fire Chief Larry J. Holms was reviewing his budget too. "We are going 
on the assumption that we will be able to maintain emergency response 
capabilities and serve the public in a way they would expect to be served," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Health Care Agency, which added extra positions this year in part to 
prevent further outbreaks of tuberculosis in the county, Director Tom Uram said 
he is hoping for more information next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just running our clinics as we have last week and the week before," he 
said. "We made no changes yet."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; OPPONENTS OF TOLL ROAD SEE A SILVER LINING IN 
FISCAL FIASCO; CONSTRUCTION: BOND FALLOUT COULD BLOCK BUILDING OF HIGHWAY 
THROUGH LAGUNA CANYON AND DOOM PROPOSAL FOR A NEW AIRPORT IN EL TORO. BUT 
OFFICIALS SAY THERE WILL BE NO SLOWING DOWN OF PROJECTS.

 Lida Lenney looks at the Orange County bond scandal and admits to more than a 
bit of wishful thinking. For the scandal may accomplish what court hearings or 
protesters perched in front of bulldozers never could, she said with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 It could stop construction of a toll road through her beloved Laguna Canyon, 
which falls right in the path of the proposed San Joaquin Transportation 
Corridor, linking San Juan Capistrano with Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Like county officials who shake their heads and say, "I don't know," when 
asked to assess the impact of the bond crisis, Lenney has no idea what the 
ultimate effect will be. 
</P>
<P>
 But she and other opponents of the proposed toll road -- as well as equally 
fierce foes of a proposed international airport at the El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station -- admitted Friday to feeling a perverse sense of pleasure over a 
bizarre political breakthrough that none anticipated, even in their wildest 
dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 Toll road opponents are so heartened by the breakthrough that they plan a 
"victory rally" in Laguna Canyon today at 10 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
 "The road is a bad road, planned for a bad place in a bad way," Lenney said, 
adding hopefully: "Anything that can stop it is welcome in my book, and maybe 
-- just maybe -- this is the thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo Mayor Susan Withrow had a similar gleam in her eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to have a huge impact," Withrow said of the scandal's impact on El 
Toro, equating it to a heart-stopping, momentum-changing fumble or interception 
that gives one team the deciding breakthrough in a football game. 
</P>
<P>
 Withrow said opponents have argued "all along that El Toro was a very costly 
project that the private sector would never be willing to fund. So that means 
bonds will have to be sold. But our ability to sell bonds in Orange County has 
been severely hampered, if not destroyed. So it's all a big question mark." 
</P>
<P>
 While opponents of the Laguna Canyon toll road and the proposed airport were 
feeling heartened, the spokeswoman for the Transportation Corridor Agencies 
that are building three county tollways said opponents should cease feeling 
smug. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not slowing down or stopping construction on any project," Lisa Telles 
said emphatically. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the agency has about $300 million -- roughly a third of its 
funding -- tied up in the county's troubled investment portfolio, Telles said, 
"our opponents should not be counting on us going bankrupt. It just isn't going 
to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Backers of a new airport at El Toro could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, toll road adversaries had been instructed in the tactics of 
civil disobedience, fearing the necessity of blocking bulldozers with their 
bodies as a last resort to what many see as the devastation of Laguna Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 They obtained a preliminary injunction in September, 1993, to stop 
construction of the project. In June, a drama unfolded in the canyon north of 
El Toro Road when a judge ruled that grading could begin, prompting bulldozers 
and protesters to race to the site. One protester chained himself to a 
bulldozer and another was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The grading was halted the next day by a second court order. But on Dec. 2, a 
three judge panel from the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals gave the toll road 
the go-ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Telles said she expected that all of the opponents' appeals will be exhausted 
early next month, clearing the way for construction through the 4 1/2 miles of 
Laguna Canyon. Remaining portions of the 15-mile San Joaquin Transportation 
Corridor are under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite Telles' optimism, former Laguna Beach Mayor Lenney and other toll 
road opponents believe that the scandal could change the momentum of the court 
process in a way no other tactic could. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who created this problem are not the ones to solve it," said 
Laguna Beach activist Beth Leeds, who echoed Lenney in predicting a turnabout 
in political fortunes. "I blame the (Orange County) Board of Supervisors, the 
Transportation Corridor Agencies and the various city managers. And now, they 
all have a lot of explaining to do. I just don't see them winning. This was a 
countywide wake-up call." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the proposed El Toro airport were feeling a similar perverse joy 
Friday. They said the financial fiasco puts a new spin on the narrowly approved 
Measure A, which asked Orange County voters if an airport should be built at 
the Marine Corps station when it closes. The measure passed with a 51% majority 
on Nov. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if Measure A were being voted on tomorrow, it would definitely be 
defeated," said Laguna Niguel Councilwoman Patricia Bates. 
</P>
<P>
 She cited an economic study commissioned for Laguna Niguel that received 
little attention when it came out in October. In light of the scandal, she 
said, that study will have far more impact. The study predicted "a major 
financial burden" on county taxpayers, who would have to bear -- according to 
its findings -- capital costs of more than $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming a 20% federal contribution, the study determined that funding the 
airport would require a minimum of $800 million in local bonds, resulting in an 
annual debt service of $60 million a year and a $40-million annual deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The airport would not produce the revenue to meet the debt service," Bates 
said. "So before you jump in, you have to ask yourself: What makes economic 
sense? What's viable? What's going to pay for itself? Because of the scandal, 
such questions suddenly have more validity." 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest Councilwoman Ann Van Haun, who opposes the El Toro airport, said 
the scandal would have repercussions far beyond both the toll road and Measure 
A. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would bet that all projects are put on hold until the mess is totally 
sorted out," Van Haun said. "Who knows what funding will be available for 
anything? Realistically, you have to look at delays and even cancellations. 
Funding for all kinds of things is under a cloud." 
</P>
<P>
 But the immediate impact of the scandal is to jar the so-called mandate of 
Measure A, she said. "In light of the bond problem, you can't possibly turn 
your back on almost half the population," referring to the 49% who voted 
against Measure A. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Bates said that if the airport proceeds in the wake of the bond 
scandal, Orange County would inherit a problem not unlike the boondoggle in 
Denver, where massive cost overruns and technical problems have delayed the 
opening of a new international airport for more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe," she said, "this is just what we needed."

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 20-year-old mother was held for questioning Friday after her 2-year-old 
daughter was found slain and her infant son was found in critical condition, 
police reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Sgt. Bob Hanson said details of the incident -- including the manner of 
death -- were being withheld by investigators. Another officer, who asked not 
to be identified, said the children "were covered with blood . . . and we're 
not really sure what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 The department identified the dead child as Tabatha Viramontez and said 
8-month-old Thomas Ryan Mora was in critical condition at Riverside Community 
Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrie Michelle Viramontez was being held for questioning. Police were called 
to the Viramontez home by neighbors after the woman ran from her apartment 
screaming, Hanson said.

 Dangerous E. coli bacteria linked to ready-to-eat salami have sickened at 
least 18 people in California and Washington, prompting 250 makers of similar 
sausages to study whether the meats are safe. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry pledged to immediately test whether E. coli O157:H7 can survive 
the process used to make dry sausages such as salami, which only involves meat 
curing, not cooking, the Agriculture Department announced late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The department then will decide "whether process modifications ought to be 
adopted to ensure the safety of fermented products," said Thomas Billy of its 
Food Safety and Inspection Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The unprecedented industry move came as health officials said Friday that 19 
people in Seattle-King County have come down with E. coli-O157:H7. Twelve cases 
have been linked by laboratory tests to salami recalled a week ago and three 
others are strongly suspected. 
</P>
<P>
 Three other cases did not come from the salami and another is unlikely to be 
linked to salami, the health department's Dr. Russell Alexander said late 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, doctors have linked two E. coli cases in Sacramento and one in 
Sonoma County to the salami. A fourth case is suspected but has not been 
confirmed, said Dr. Ben Werner of the California Health Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Four patients are hospitalized, the most serious a 2-year-old King County girl 
undergoing kidney dialysis. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco Sausage Co. has recalled 10,000 pounds of sliced dry salami, the 
only type implicated. But it also told grocers to temporarily halt sales of any 
of its other dry salami brands, and ceased all salami production. 
</P>
<P>
 The brands, sold only in Washington, California and Oregon, include Columbus, 
Alpine, Pocino, Ticino, Buon Gusto, Campagne and Carando. But Werner warned 
that people may not know they have that salami because it is typically sold by 
delicatessens in unmarked paper.

KEY WEAPONS PROGRAM FACES DEFENSE DEPT. AX; MILITARY: PENTAGON HALTS BUILDING 
OF HIGH-TECH MISSILE. 6 OTHER PROJECTS ARE TARGETED IN PLAN TO SAVE $7.7 
BILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Defense Department announced plans Friday to cancel one of its major 
weapons development programs and delay or cut short six others to help pay for 
new efforts to improve military preparedness and living conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The cutbacks, which will trim some $7.7 billion from weapons programs over the 
next six years, were far smaller than had been expected -- in part because 
President Clinton agreed last week to provide an extra $25 billion during the 
period to help finance such improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Pentagon officials said that if Clinton had declined to support the 
increases in the defense budget, the department might have had to cancel or 
delay up to $20 billion worth of weapons programs -- a move that would have 
seriously impaired the military's modernization plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said the combination of actions effectively will 
eliminate the $49-billion gap that the Pentagon had projected between the 
military's requirements and the money that Clinton previously had budgeted to 
meet those needs for the six-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern over the projected shortfall is threatening to become a major 
political issue in January, when Republicans take control of Congress. Many key 
GOP lawmakers believe that the defense budget still is too low, and have vowed 
to increase it further. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts have expressed doubts that the Administration would be able to 
maintain the kind of military force needed to win two major regional wars at 
once -- the goal that it set in 1993 -- without devoting substantially more 
money in future years. 
</P>
<P>
 Carole Lessure, an analyst for the Defense Budget Project, a nonpartisan 
defense-monitoring group, said that while the cuts announced on Friday "help in 
the short-term," they "beg the longer-term question" of whether the military 
will be able to fulfill Clinton's requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 The decisions announced on Friday include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Immediate cancellation of development of the Air Force's Tri-Service 
Stand-off Attack Missile, or TSSAM -- one of the military's most 
high-technology precision-guided weapons. Savings: $2.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Army's Comanche helicopter program will be cut short. The Army had 
touted the helicopter as a key to its force of the future, and the Pentagon 
will build two flyable prototypes to perfect the technology. The aircraft will 
now not be put into production. Savings: $2.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 * Funding for development of the Air Force's F-22 fighter will be trimmed by 
about 10%, delaying arrival of the aircraft by a few months. And the Marine 
Corps' advanced amphibious assault vehicle (AAAV) will be delayed by two years. 
Combined savings: $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Navy will be ordered to slow its purchases of radar-evading Aegis 
destroyers to 16 between fiscal 1996 and fiscal 2001 instead of the 18 
envisioned initially. It also will delay the start of its new attack submarine 
program for a year. Combined savings: $3 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Pentagon will go ahead with production of the controversial V-22 Osprey 
-- a tilt-rotor aircraft that can take off like a helicopter and fly like a 
fixed-wing plane. But the Marine Corps will be forced to buy fewer than it 
initially requested. Projected savings: $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Two other programs that initially had been considered for possible 
cancellation were left essentially intact. They include the Army's proposal to 
develop an Advanced Field Artillery System and the Joint Primary Aircraft 
Training System, or JPATS, trainer aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for cancellation of the TSSAM program, the bulk of the cuts appeared to 
be marginal. Defense Secretary William J. Perry called the reductions prudent, 
and said they would not interfere with development of the new weaponry that the 
military needs. 
</P>
<P>
 However, officials conceded privately that canceling the TSSAM program could 
prove significant in coming years. The military had been counting on it to 
provide a radar-evading, high-speed missile for the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior defense official said that the department would review the decision 
later in the decade if it appeared that the United States was failing to keep 
up with the missile threat from potential adversaries. For now, he said, the 
United States still has the technological edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction to Friday's decisions was predictable. Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a 
senior Republican on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said the cuts would 
leave the military's modernization program underfunded. He called for 
alternative reductions in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Department officials said that the $7.7 billion in expected savings 
from Friday's announced cutbacks, plus the $25 billion that Clinton has agreed 
to provide, $12 billion more for adjustments stemming from new inflation 
estimates and $2 billion in supplemental funding, would essentially eliminate 
the $49-billion funding gap that the Pentagon had projected.

GOP FRESHMEN GETTING KEY HOUSE COMMITTEE POSTS; CONGRESS: CONSERVATIVE 
NEWCOMERS ARE RECEIVING NEARLY TWO-THIRDS OF 31 PLUM VACANCIES, IN A BLOW TO 
SENIORITY SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Shattering the seniority system on which congressional influence traditionally 
is based, House Republican leaders announced Friday that they are awarding most 
open seats on key committees to freshmen lawmakers, ensuring them a major role 
in enacting the GOP's legislative agenda next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The young and homogeneously conservative GOP class of '94, which so far has 
shown an almost lock-step loyalty to incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich of 
Georgia, received nearly two-thirds of the 31 plum vacancies on the 
Appropriations, Ways and Means and Commerce committees. 
</P>
<P>
 They also received a slot on the pivotal Rules Committee and six of the eight 
vacant seats on the House Judiciary Committee -- which, along with Ways and 
Means, will handle most of the legislation in the GOP's list of campaign 
pledges, known as the "contract with America." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to have an infusion of new blood and restore the health of the 
body, you ought to put it in the main artery," said incoming House Majority 
Leader Dick Armey (R-Tex.) as he announced the committee assignments at a 
Capitol Hill news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The 73 newcomers received seven of the 11 open seats on the House 
Appropriations Committee, three of the 10 vacancies on the Ways and Means 
Committee, six of the eight openings on the Judiciary Committee and nine of the 
10 open seats on the newly renamed Commerce Committee, formerly known as the 
Energy and Commerce Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 California lawmakers received three of those coveted seats. Former singer and 
Palm Springs Mayor Sonny Bono won a slot on the Judiciary Committee, Frank 
Riggs of Windsor will sit on Appropriations and Brian P. Bilbray of Imperial 
Beach is going to Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is quite remarkable," Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar with the 
American Enterprise Institute, a Washington think tank, said of the freshmen's 
clout in winning so many senior committee posts. "The only analogy in modern 
times is the (post-Watergate) freshman class of 1974, but even they were not 
given the deference that this class has received from its leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 That deference, a reflection of the unusually close alliance that the senior 
leadership has forged with its new legislative recruits since the Nov. 8 
elections, is based on what both sides say is a mutual recognition of their 
importance to one another. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich and other senior GOP leaders, like House Majority Whip Tom DeLay of 
Texas, were extremely active during the campaign -- raising money and providing 
political advice and support to many of the Republican challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Already united under the ideological umbrella of Gingrich's "contract with 
America," many of the freshmen arrived in Washington with the knowledge that 
they were deeply indebted to the GOP leadership that helped get them elected. 
As a result, they have been among the most vocal and unquestioning supporters 
of Gingrich's efforts to consolidate and centralize power in his office. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the freshmen owe GOP leaders a debt of gratitude, the leadership also 
recognizes that it would not be in the majority now had it not been for the 
freshmen, and it has bent over backward to be unusually solicitous of the 
newcomers as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two years ago, there was another class that came to Washington saying they 
were going to bring about reform, but their leadership headed them off at the 
pass," said Rep.-elect Gerry Weller (R-Ill.), referring to the Democrats who 
came to Congress in 1992 with a strong reform agenda that was continually 
frustrated by the Democratic leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the exact opposite has occurred with the leadership we are working with 
today," Weller said. "The leadership we have in Newt Gingrich and Dick Armey 
and Tom DeLay and others has been listening to the concerns and ideas of the 
new members." 
</P>
<P>
 The freshmen are "the majority makers" of the new Congress, Armey acknowledged 
as he made it clear that the leadership expects the junior lawmakers to be a 
more potent force for change than any freshman class before them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With Gingrich's tacit approval, the freshmen already have flexed their 
numerical muscle by prodding their colleagues, in organizational meetings over 
the last week, to agree to eliminate public funding for congressional caucuses 
and research organizations and to put one of the Capitol's sprawling office 
buildings up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 But if they have gotten off to a quick and unusually cohesive start, it 
remains to be seen how the freshmen's unity and loyalty to the leadership will 
fare once Congress gets down to the actual business of legislating in January, 
many analysts note. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting from the 10-point contract with America, which is three pages long, 
to at least 10 serious bills, most of which are going to involve hundreds of 
pages of legislation, is going to be a very difficult process," Ornstein said. 
The freshmen "are all on board for now . . . but it's when you start getting 
down to the details that you start seeing the strains."

HEAD OF FORD FOUNDATION TO STEP DOWN; PHILANTHROPY: FRANKLIN THOMAS IS 
DEPARTING AFTER 17 YEARS AT THE HELM OF NATION'S LARGEST NONPROFIT CHARITABLE 
ORGANIZATION. HE INSTITUTED MAJOR PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Franklin A. Thomas, president of the Ford Foundation for 17 years, said Friday 
he is resigning to devote more time to promoting democracy and economic 
development in South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas aggressively led the Ford Foundation, the nation's largest private 
philanthropic organization, into the fight for human rights and into 
significant new efforts against urban and rural poverty. 
</P>
<P>
 Succeeding him as president when he leaves early in 1996 will be Susan V. 
Berresford, vice president for worldwide programs at the foundation and a 
Thomas protege. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very good" about the current shape of the foundation, Thomas said in 
an interview. " . . . This gives me a chance to focus more concretely and 
discretely on the problems and opportunities of South Africa." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, 60, said that he was excited to be undertaking new endeavors. "The 
sense you have another 15 years of active work is just fabulous," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ford Foundation was established in 1936 with gifts and bequests of Ford 
Motor Co. stock. During Thomas' tenure, the philanthropy's portfolio (which as 
a matter of policy no longer includes Ford stock) grew to assets of over $6.5 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Major new programs were instituted, including strengthening community 
development corporations in the United States and abroad. In 1979, the Ford 
Foundation established the Local Initiatives Support Corp. -- the nation's 
largest community development support organization -- with programs in 34 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Since its inception, LISC has raised more than $1.3 billion in donations and 
investments and with the organization's help, 50,000 affordable houses and 
apartments have been built or renovated. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Thomas' presidency, the Ford Foundation broadened its global reach, 
opening offices in a number of new nations, including South Africa. Foundation 
officials now are talking to the Vietnamese government about a presence in 
Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas said that under Berresford, 51, the foundation "will improve," adding 
that she would bring both "continuity and newness" to the president's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Her mind "is as lively and engaged as any in the world," he said. A lawyer and 
star Ivy League basketball player, Thomas served as a deputy New York City 
police commissioner and headed the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corp. before 
joining the Ford Foundation.

TWO SEEKING MONEY TO SHOP ADMIT TO KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two teen-agers were ready to shop so they bludgeoned a 77-year-old widow to 
death in her apartment, then stole her cash and credit cards and hopped in her 
car to drive to a shopping mall, police alleged Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-agers, females aged 14 and 19, knew enough about Annie Jones to 
persuade the former Sunday school teacher to open her door by convincing her 
they wanted to talk about God, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones usually kept her door shut and locked, relatives said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials said the teen-agers admitted to the killing and were charged 
Thursday, three days after a police officer realized they had tried to use the 
dead woman's credit cards to buy jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 Police alleged that the two had planned it for some time, and one of the 
suspects, Dionna Beachem, 19, had once lived in Jones' building. 
</P>
<P>
 Beachem was held without bond on charges of murder and home invasion. The 
14-year-old, not identified because of her age, faced the same charges in a 
juvenile petition and was held in a youth facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Police alleged that once inside Jones' vestibule, the teen-agers pulled her 
knit cap over her eyes, pushed her down and beat her head against the floor.

18 AT NEW JERSEY POLICE DEPT. SHARE JACKPOT

<TEXT>
<P>
 The cops were smiling Friday in this northern New Jersey suburb after 18 
department members won a $27.9-million lottery jackpot. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Howard Shaw, himself a winner, said 16 officers, one dispatcher 
and a secretary, out of a total force of 28, each chipped in $5 for the 
Thursday night drawing. That works out to approximately $1.5 million per 
person, or about $70,000 a year before taxes for the next 20 years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey Lottery officials could not confirm the department's announcement 
because they hadn't seen the ticket, but did say one winning ticket was sold.

APPELLATE JUSTICES CONSIDER RELEASE ON BAIL FOR NESLER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three appellate justices took testimony Friday on a possible pre-Christmas 
release for Ellie Nesler, the Sonora woman convicted of killing her son's 
alleged molester in a courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The justices took the case under advisement after a 40-minute hearing.They are 
expected to issue a written ruling by the end of the month, said court clerk 
Kevin A. Swanson. 
</P>
<P>
 Nesler's attorney, Donald Segerstrom of Sonora, told the justices that "clear 
and convincing evidence" was presented to the trial judge that Nesler would not 
jump bail or be a danger to others if released. Once those conditions are met, 
bail is mandatory, Segerstrom argued. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Atty. Gen. Jane Kirkland countered that Nesler's lawyers failed to meet 
those conditions in their initial bail request. 
</P>
<P>
 Nesler was not present at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Supreme Court kicked the case back to the 5th District Court of 
Appeals with instructions to consider bail while her voluntary manslaughter 
conviction is on appeal. The Fresno-based 5th District Court previously 
rejected a bid for bail.

INDIAN TRIBE SCALES BACK CASINO PLANS; GAMBLING: AGUA CALIENTE OFFICIALS WILL 
OPEN SMALLER CARD CLUB AT SPA HOTEL, POSSIBLY AS EARLY AS APRIL. THEY STILL 
PLAN A FREE-STANDING FACILITY WITH CAESARS WORLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Stymied in its efforts to construct a $25-million downtown casino, the Agua 
Caliente Indians announced plans Friday to open a smaller card club at their 
Spa Hotel and bring gambling to the desert resort town by April. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The card club, to be in a 9,000-square-foot convention room at the 240-room 
downtown hotel, will provide the tribe with an immediate source of new income, 
tribal Chairman Richard Milanovich said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tribe will continue its efforts to develop a larger, free-standing 
gambling facility with Caesars World, Milanovich said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state has sued to block development of the Caesars casino, contending that 
a land swap between the tribe and the city to facilitate the project is against 
the law. 
</P>
<P>
 The smaller gambling hall, Milanovich said, will offer various card games, 
including poker and popular Asian games, but it will not offer high-stakes 
bingo or electronic slot machines. Other Native American tribes in California 
flaunt the use of the video gambling machines despite court rulings that they 
violate state law -- an issue that is entangled in the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 Tribal attorney Art Bunce said the tribe -- whose checkerboard reservation 
includes half of Palm Springs and neighboring communities -- has sued the state 
to force removal of state Lotto and Keno games from retail businesses that 
lease land from the tribe. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state won't negotiate with this tribe to allow Class Three (electronic 
slot machine) gaming, yet they are playing their own Class Three games on 
Indian reservation land," Bunce said.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputy State Atty. Gen. Manuel Medeiros said his office realized only last 
year that the state's lottery and other games were being played on tribal land, 
and has been working since then to identify which retailers are situated on 
tribal land. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of confusing land title searches, identifying which lottery operations 
must be removed has proved difficult, Medeiros said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we've already told the tribe that once we know which retailers are on 
tribal land, we'll pull our games out of there," Medeiros said. 
</P>
<P>
 Milanovich said the card club at the Spa is considered an interim gambling 
facility until a larger one is built, either at the proposed site or elsewhere 
in Palm Springs. The smaller club, he said, will be managed and operated by the 
tribe itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has embraced the larger Caesars casino project because of a 
revenue-sharing agreement between the tribe and the city and because it would 
provide an economic boost to downtown tourism, Palm Springs Mayor Lloyd 
Maryanov said. 
</P>
<P>
 The smaller card club would provide no revenue to the city, and because of its 
location at the tribe's hotel, it would not provide as much spillover revenue 
to other downtown businesses, he said.

 The city of Los Angeles will proceed with its legal opposition to Proposition 
187 at a federal court hearing Monday while seeking free legal counsel to carry 
its case. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council on Friday left unchanged its orders regarding the 
anti-illegal immigration initiative, meaning that City Atty.James Hahn will 
continue with his attempts to intervene in the case on the side of the American 
Civil Liberties Union and others trying to block the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 After considerable public pressure, the city attorney had offered less 
contentious alternatives in a letter to the council Thursday. Those included 
filing a friend of the court brief asking for clarification of the proposition, 
asking the attorney general's office for instructions, and requesting federal 
agencies to specify any conflicts with federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 But with only 10 council members present Friday, there was no consensus to 
order Hahn out of the Proposition 187 legal battle. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's attorneys are scheduled to go before U.S. District Judge Mariana R. 
Pfaelzer on Monday on their request to intervene in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 In reaction to public complaints about spending tax dollars to fight a measure 
approved by voters, Hahn said he is continuing to seek private lawyers to 
represent the city in the case voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Joel Wachs, who has tried to lessen or eliminate the city's 
involvement in the court case, said he does not expect the issue to die. "There 
is going to be a very irate public, especially since (Hahn's) own letter gives 
other options," Wachs said.

EXPLOSION OF PRESSURIZED OXYGEN CHAMBER AT CLINIC INJURES 5 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five people were injured Friday when a pressurized chamber used to treat 
stroke victims exploded at a medical clinic in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Two people who were sitting in the hyperbaric chamber sustained injuries 
similar to the bends suffered by divers who ascend too quickly, according to 
Emmy Day, a spokeswoman for the Orange County Fire Department.The chamber, 
which is used to increase the supply of oxygen to the brain, burst under 
pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Three others in a waiting area of the Health Restoration Center were struck by 
flying debris, including chunks of the heavy plastic chamber door, Day said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The doors and windows rattled," said Bruce Johnson, a commercial real estate 
broker who works nearby. "I heard bang and thought it was a car accident. It 
sounded like that."  
</P>
<P>
 The five injured, all in their 50s and 60s, were in stable condition at 
Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center in Mission Viejo. Their names were not 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators had not determined what caused the chamber to burst.

REPUBLICAN LAWSUIT OVER LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL'S BUDGET DISMISSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge Friday dismissed a lawsuit that claimed that lawmakers 
manipulated the budget of the Legislature's legal adviser to avoid the 
voter-approved cuts of Proposition 140. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge James T. Ford said the Republican-backed lawsuit prompted concerns about 
involving the judiciary in the internal operations of the legislative branch of 
government.That is a potential breach of the separation of powers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This poses grave risks for the government of the state," Ford said. 
</P>
<P>
 Backers of the lawsuit immediately announced that they would appeal the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the Pacific Legal Foundation filed the suit on behalf of former 
Los Angeles County Supervisor Pete Schabarum, accusing the Democrat-controlled 
Legislature of illegally removing the budget of the legislative counsel's 
office from the spending limits imposed by Proposition 140. 
</P>
<P>
 That initiative, authored by Schabarum and approved in 1990, cut lawmakers' 
budgets, eliminated their retirement fund and limited their terms of office. 
The Legislature, with 120 members and about 1,700 workers, cut its $176-million 
annual budget to $114 million, a $62-million reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schabarum said lawmakers improperly protected the legislative counsel's 
budget -- about $50 million -- from the provisions of the initiative. The 
lawsuit asked that the office's budget be included when computing the 
Proposition 140 cuts.

STALLED ASSEMBLY RECESSES WITH NO SOLUTION IN SIGHT; POLITICS: LEGISLATORS 
WON'T RECONVENE UNTIL JAN. 4, BUT DUELING LEADERS WILL MEET NEXT WEEK IN BID TO 
END STALEMATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Assembly recessed Friday, agreeing to reconvene Jan. 4 but with no 
solution in sight to the speakership debacle that has left the house in a state 
of paralysis. 
</P>
<P>
 The two leaders fighting for the job, longtime Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco) and Republican leader Jim Brulte of Rancho Cucamonga, have agreed to 
meet in private next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The two are scheduled to hold their first meeting beginning at 8:30 a.m. 
Monday at an undisclosed location in an attempt to find an agreeable plan they 
can sell to their caucuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the Assembly can select a Speaker, the law prohibits the lower house 
from conducting business. So far, the options available have been for either 
Brown or Brulte to obtain 41 votes in the 80-member chamber, a feat neither 
could achieve when the Assembly met this week. Among other possibilities 
mentioned has been a joint leadership compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men are tied with 40 speakership votes each, even though the 
Republicans held the edge in Assembly membership, 41 to 39, after the Nov. 8 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 In the vote for Speaker on Monday, Assemblyman Paul Horcher (R-Diamond Bar) 
evened the score for the Democrats by bolting the GOP ranks, becoming an 
independent, and voting for Brown as Speaker, producing the 40-40 stalemate. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last three days, the Assembly has convened briefly only to call the 
roll and immediately recess until the next day, following the provisions of 
internal house rules. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, five Democratic members showed up, the next day two, and on 
Friday only Assemblyman Joe Baca (D-San Bernardino) appeared on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an obscure rule, Baca said, the lower house can now legally be in recess 
until Jan. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Rank-and-file Assembly members are continuing to collect their $72,000 
salaries during the deadlock, but only those legislators who actually come to 
the Capitol to work can apply for the additional $101-a-day per diem to cover 
living expenses.

CIVIL RIGHTS COMPLAINT TARGETS STATE'S TOXIC DUMPS; LAW: IN UNIQUE FILING, 
GROUPS SAY OPERATING THREE WASTE SITES NEAR POOR LATINO COMMUNITIES IS 
DISCRIMINATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK CLIFFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in California, a federal civil rights statute has been 
invoked in a legal battle over pollution -- in this case over the exposure of 
Latino farm workers and their families to toxic waste. 
</P>
<P>
 In a joint complaint to the federal Environmental Protection Agency, three 
community groups from Central and Southern California on Friday alleged 
discrimination in the operation of the state's three toxic waste dumps, all of 
which are near poor, Latino communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint is part of a new strategy encouraged by President Clinton to use 
the 1964 Civil Rights Act to target pollution sources that threaten the health 
and safety of minority communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Named in the complaint are the California Environmental Protection Agency, the 
three counties where the dumps are situated and two of the nation's largest 
waste disposal firms, Laidlaw Inc. and Chemical Waste Management, which operate 
the dumps. 
</P>
<P>
 Prepared by California Rural Legal Assistance on behalf of the three community 
groups, the complaint states that "100% of the toxic waste disposed of in 
landfills in California is dumped in or near low-income Latino communities." It 
is a reference to Buttonwillow in Kern County, Kettleman City in Kings County 
and Westmorland in Imperial County -- towns of under 2,000 people, all within a 
few miles of the state's only toxic waste landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Low-income, Latino communities have been targeted during the siting of toxic 
waste dumps, and then conspicuously excluded from permit decisions affecting 
their health, environment, housing and quality of life," the complaint states. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kettleman City dump is the largest of its kind west of Louisiana, and the 
Buttonwillow facility will be larger if it is successful in its efforts to 
double its size. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint is the latest chapter in a long-running campaign to prevent 
expansion of the dumps and to require state and local agencies to regulate them 
more strictly. Activists have argued for years that residents have been forced 
to endure a variety of hazards -- from air pollution to ground water 
contamination, rat bites and spilled loads of toxic trash. 
</P>
<P>
 Community groups are trying to make the case that their towns were 
disproportionately affected and therefore discriminated against under the 1964 
Civil Rights Act. That act prohibits discrimination in programs or activities 
that receive federal funding. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint calls for terminating federal assistance to the named counties 
and government bodies unless there "is an immediate moratorium on the siting 
and expansion of any toxic waste facilities in communities of color." 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint would also give the affected communities a larger role in future 
decisions about the dumps. 
</P>
<P>
 According to officials of the federal EPA, which will rule on the merits of 
the complaint, the California case is one of the first 20 in the nation to test 
the relevancy of the civil rights law in environmental disputes. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint was filed, said one EPA official, after extensive consultation 
with the federal agency by California Rural Legal Assistance lawyer Luke Cole. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably had more discussions with Luke Cole than any other complainant in 
a similar case," said the official, who asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 EPA officials said the California case is the first to call for penalties 
against private companies. If Laidlaw and Chemical Waste are found to have 
discriminated, contracts they have with the EPA to clean up federal Superfund 
sites could be canceled, said EPA officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The attempt to extend the 1964 Civil Rights Act to the environmental arena 
follows an order by Clinton this year calling for federal agencies to take 
steps to lighten what the Administration saw as a disproportionate burden of 
pollutants and other hazards on minority communities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The executive order says the EPA has to be sensitive to the issue of undue 
exposure to environmental hazards of low-income and minority communities," said 
Clarice Gaylord, director of the EPA's office of environmental justice.

MOTHER GUILTY OF NOT REPORTING DAUGHTER'S RAPE; COURTS: GIRL, 7, WAS ATTACKED 
BY WOMAN'S AIDS-INFECTED GROOM ON THEIR WEDDING DAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 A mother was convicted Friday of child endangerment and of being an accessory 
to the rape of her 7-year-old daughter, who was attacked on the woman's wedding 
day by her AIDS-infected groom. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors deliberated four days before convicting the 38-year-old woman on both 
felony charges. She faces a maximum sentence of nearly seven years for failing 
to notify police that her daughter had been beaten and raped. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside County Superior Court Judge Robert McIntyre scheduled a Jan. 10 
sentencing hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, who now lives out of state, was infected with the AIDS virus during 
the attack.  
</P>
<P>
 The woman's husband, Frank Bridges, 43, who has a different last name from the 
girl, pleaded guilty in June to five felony counts in connection with the Jan. 
15 attack. He is serving a 38-year sentence. He refused to testify against his 
wife at her trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Tim Schaaf called Bridges a "monster," but said the mother 
failed to intervene during the attack and provided an unsafe environment for 
her daughter and two sons, ages 8 and 10. 
</P>
<P>
 On the couple's wedding day, Bridges lured the child upstairs to a bedroom, 
promising to reward her with a dollar. Once there, he locked the door, hit the 
girl and raped her. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearing his sister's screams and then seeing her bloodstained dress, the 
10-year-old brother dialed 911. Jurors heard a tape of that call and the 
mother's voice screaming, "Don't! Don't!" just before the line went dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaaf said that the mother hung up the phone and refused to answer when the 
operator called back. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Bruce Cormicle argued that his client was confused and 
distraught, and was more interested in comforting her child than in summoning 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaaf said Bridges lived with the woman and her children before the wedding. 
He routinely left drug paraphernalia, including needles, all over the house, 
Schaaf told jurors. The AIDS virus can be transmitted by contaminated needles 
as well as through sexual intercourse. 
</P>
<P>
 During the couple's marriage ceremony, the groom talked of pawning his wedding 
ring to buy drugs. A videotape of that incident was shown during the woman's 
trial.

LATE SCORE CAPS SAILOR COMEBACK; DIVISION V FOOTBALL: TOUCHDOWN PASS WITH LESS 
THAN THREE MINUTES LEFT IN THE GAME GIVES NEWPORT HARBOR A 20-15 VICTORY OVER 
SERVITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With one flick of quarterback John Giordani's wrist, Newport Harbor proved 
again it was a team of destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Giordani's 38-yard touchdown pass to Mike Freeman with 2 minutes 37 seconds 
left in the game helped the Sailors to a 20-15 victory over Servite in the 
Southern Section Division V championship football game Friday at Orange Coast 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 The overflow crowd of 8,000 then watched Newport Harbor's defense seal the 
victory with a quarterback sack that produced a fumble. Jack Hogan recovered 
for the Sailors at the Servite 33 with 1:30 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Three plays later, the celebration began. 
</P>
<P>
 The championship was the first for top-seeded Newport Harbor (14-0) in its 
64-year football history. The Sailors lost to Bonita in the 1942 Lower Division 
final, 39-6, and lost to Irvine in the 1992 Division IV final, 30-8. But they 
wouldn't be denied this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is for them, the kids and the community," Newport Harbor Coach Jeff 
Brinkley said. "It was time for our community to have a (Southern Section) 
title." 
</P>
<P>
 That title appeared to be in jeopardy midway through the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Servite trailed, 14-9, but moved 42 yards in six plays to the Newport Harbor 
one. Servite's David Bedard, who rushed for 120 yards in 25 carries, scored on 
a one-yard run to give Servite a 15-14 lead with 4:08 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 After David Martin's pass for a two-point conversion was intercepted by 
Newport Harbor's Dan Eadie, the Sailors had one last chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were telling each other that we're this close to it all," said Newport 
Harbor guard Bill Johns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors started the drive from their 23 and Giordani, who completed seven 
of 13 passes for 160 yards, began the drive by scrambling. But Giordani pulled 
up and tossed a 20-yard pass to Danny Pulido, who had five catches for 79 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Two carries by Brian Johnson, who had 134 yards rushing in 19 carries, moved 
the ball to the 38 to set up Freeman's game-winning catch, which culminated a 
four-play, 77-yard drive that took only 1:26. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have been winning games with big plays all season," Servite Coach Larry 
Toner said. "They won it with big plays tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Servite dominated the second half, holding the Sailors to two first downs 
until the final drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had our strength out there. I had every reason to believe we could stop 
them," Toner said. "They made a great play and that was that." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor's defense also made big plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Servite, which rushed for 244 yards, moved 54 yards in 13 plays to the Newport 
Harbor 19 on its first drive of the second half. But an interception by Newport 
Harbor's Dan McDonough stopped the drive with 1:05 remaining in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friars (11-3) seemed to move the ball easily on the ground. Frank Patti 
rushed for 65 yards and a touchdown in 13 carries and Marvin Smith added 62 
yards in 11 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 But Newport Harbor limited Servite to 11 yards passing. Martin, who was sacked 
twice, was able to complete only one of four passes. Last week, he attempted 
only six passes and had two intercepted in a 34-19 victory over El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 Giordani completed three passes to Pulido on Newport Harbor's first drive of 
the game to help set up a 14-yard touchdown run by Johnson. Johnson's touchdown 
gave Newport Harbor a 7-6 lead, countering 15-yard touchdown run by Patti on 
the Friars' opening drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Giordani's 43-yard completion to Jon Benzinger highlighted a seven-play, 
80-yard drive. Giordani capped the drive with a one-yard touchdown run with 
2:11 remaining in the second quarter to make it 14-9, Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people think we're just another smash-mouth football team," Brinkley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Giordani and the Sailors showed they weren't, and now they have the trophy and 
an unbeaten season to prove it.

A REAL WING-DING FOR BLOOMINGTON; HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: RECORD-SETTING SCHOOL 
ENDS PERFECT SEASON WITH 48-32 VICTORY OVER LA MIRADA FOR DIVISION VIII TITLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Fasten your seat belts and make sure your lap trays and chair backs are in 
their locked and upright position, Bloomington High's double-wing offense has 
taken off. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the deceivingly simple and archaic-looking offensive formation, 
Bloomington defeated La Mirada, 48-32, Friday to win the Southern Section 
Division VIII championship game at La Mirada. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Greg Oliver does the bulk of the work for the Bruin offense, 
which features two running backs split behind each tight end and a fullback who 
lines up closely behind the quarterback. Friday was no different as Oliver 
rushed for 260 yards and four touchdowns for the Bruins (14-0). 
</P>
<P>
 The victory completed a seemingly impossible U-turn from last season when the 
Bruins finished 1-9. But first-year Coach Don Markham brought his unlikely 
offense before this season, and Bloomington broke the national single-season 
scoring record last week with a 34-21 semifinal victory over Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Their 880 points this season break the previous record of 827, set by Big 
Sandy, Tex., in 14 games in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a satisfying year because we weren't supposed to do anything," Markham 
said. "It was sort of a Cinderella story. That's the whole story. Rags to 
riches." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't easy money, though, in the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloomington, which has beaten teams, 86-8, 84-0 and 72-14, this season with an 
offense that features only eight running plays and two passing plays, found 
itself leading by only two points, 34-32, with 2:34 to play in the third 
quarter after La Mirada's Hugo Corral ran 34 yards to set up a one-yard 
touchdown run by Brett Darnell. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, for run-happy Bloomington, it survived by the pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing fourth and 11 to start the fourth quarter, Jason Buell threw to Oliver 
for a 24-yard gain to bring Bloomington to the La Mirada seven-yard line. Three 
plays later, David Smith scored on a three-yard run to put the Bruins up by 10 
points and out of reach of the Matadors. 
</P>
<P>
 Markham said the fourth-down play was the key. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking we better move the ball here or we're going to get beat," 
Markham said. 'We won by the pass." 
</P>
<P>
 For La Mirada Coach John Mele, that was the turning point as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we get some momentum, we go down there and score, it might be a different 
game," Mele said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bloomington closed out the scoring and got a little closer to its 64-point 
average with 2:27 to play on a 30-yard run by Cheyane Caldwell.

HEISMAN LONGSHOT NO MORE; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: COLORADO'S SALAAM STARTED THE 
SEASON AS THE SECOND, MAYBE THIRD, CANDIDATE ON HIS TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Colorado running back Rashaan Salaam is the logical favorite to win today's 
60th annual Heisman Trophy award. But in a season rich with surprises, who said 
anything about logic? 
</P>
<P>
 Think about it. Five of six finalists for the coveted stiff-arming statuette 
were considered Heisman longshots at season's beginning. Now look at them. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Salaam was the second, maybe third candidate from Colorado. That was before 
the former San Diego-area high school star became only the fourth player in 
NCAA Division I-A history to gain 2,000 or more yards. Suddenly no one was 
talking about teammates Kordell Stewart or Michael Westbrook. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a reason for that: Each of the previous 2,000-yard rushers -- 
Nebraska's Mike Rozier, Oklahoma State's Barry Sanders and USC's Marcus Allen 
-- won the Heisman. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Forget being ranked among the top three quarterbacks when the season began. 
Penn State's Kerry Collins wasn't even the best Collins. Michigan quarterback 
Todd Collins supposedly had that title. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Kerry led the Nittany Lions to an 11-0 season, a No. 2 ranking and 
put up some impressive aerial numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Alcorn State quarterback Steve McNair was the curiosity piece, a Division 
I-AA player who put up huge statistics at a small school in a relatively 
obscure conference. He finished the regular season with 44 touchdowns passing, 
nine touchdowns rushing, 4,863 yards passing and 936 yards rushing. He probably 
won't win the Heisman, but he was good enough to dispel the myth that the best 
players always play in Division I-A. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Alabama quarterback Jay Barker ended the regular season with nearly half as 
many yards passing as Georgia's Eric Zeier. Then again, Zeier finished with 
nearly half as many victories. 
</P>
<P>
 What Barker lacked in highlight footage, he made up in victories. His record 
at Alabama: 34-2-1, the best in Crimson Tide history. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Miami's Warren Sapp is a defensive lineman, which tells you about his 
preseason Heisman hopes. Then Sapp went to work, and offensive lines parted. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Only Penn State running back Ki-Jana Carter among the finalists was listed 
as a preseason Heisman hopeful. Carter suffered a hand injury against Temple 
but recovered in time to help take the Nittany Lions to the Rose Bowl. John 
Becker, director of player personnel for the Rams, says Carter is the most 
complete back in college football. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever wins the award will have benefited from a seemingly inordinate number 
of injuries to some of the country's best players. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska quarterback Tommie Frazier, easily one of the premier Heisman 
candidates, missed most of the season because of a blood clot in his leg. UCLA 
wide receiver J.J. Stokes suffered a thigh injury and spent all but a few games 
on the sideline. Michigan running back Tyrone Wheatley hurt his shoulder and 
couldn't make up enough ground to seriously challenge for the award. USC 
quarterback Rob Johnson and Stanford quarterback Steve Stenstrom also were 
banged up. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Washington running back Napoleon Kaufman faded down the stretch. 
Notre Dame quarterback Ron Powlus suffered from inexperience and a so-so 
offensive line. Ohio State's Joey Galloway had an off year. Florida quarterback 
Terry Dean was benched. Zeier played on an average team and threw too many 
interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerging was Salaam, the first Heisman favorite to publicly say he didn't want 
the thing because it brought too much attention and pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Like it or not, Salaam probably gets the trophy today. And in a season of 
strangeness, it only makes sense that one of the 920 ballots was sent to O.J. 
Simpson, whose Heisman status guarantees him a vote -- jail or no jail. Wonder 
who he picked?

ANTELOPES TAKE IT TO AND FROM HART; DIVISION II FINAL: FIVE INDIAN TURNOVERS 
PAVE WAY FOR ANTELOPE VALLEY'S 36-15 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Hart High's offense was a high-flying circus act -- a real headliner. 
</P>
<P>
 But in front of 8,000 fans at College of the Canyons Friday night, Antelope 
Valley's defense stopped the show and closed the curtain, posting a stunning 
36-15 rout to win the Southern Section Division II championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the third section title for Antelope Valley under Coach Brent 
Newcomb, whose teams won championships in 1981 and 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart (13-1), with a line that averages 6 foot 4, 266 pounds and an offense 
that scored 51 and 55 points in its two previous playoff games, might still be 
seeing dust from what will be remembered as a furious first-half Antelope 
stampede. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first 24 minutes, Hart committed five turnovers -- two fumbles and 
three interceptions -- and watched Antelope Valley (11-2) ring up a 29-0 lead 
at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were pumped this whole week," said Antelope tackle Chad Shrout, who sacked 
Hart quarterback Steve McKeon four times and kicked three field goals. "We 
studied their offense. We knew what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our motto is 'Bring the punch to the party.' We brought the punch." 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley defense blitzed McKeon, clogged the middle and shot 
through gaps to greet alarmed ballcarriers in the backfield. It took the game 
to Hart. 
</P>
<P>
 Or did Hart hand the game to Antelope Valley? The Indians seemed flustered by 
their opponent's relentlessness. 
</P>
<P>
 While Antelope Valley's defense did most of the damage, running back Jermaine 
Lewis had 207 of the team's 314 offensive yards. He rushed for 155 yards and 
one touchdown and passed for 52 and another score. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon completed 24 of 41 passes for 364 yards with three interceptions, but 
Hart's best player, running back Ted Iacenda, was held to 60 yards in 13 
carries. A 19-yard run on his first carry was his longest. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Antelope Valley) has such speed in the secondary, they just fly up and make 
tackles," Hart offensive coordinator Dean Herrington said. "I'm sure it 
shellshocked us a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 After Shrout opened the scoring with a line-drive 45-yard field goal, Justin 
Reiner intercepted a McKeon pass near midfield. Six plays later, Lewis scored 
on a 10-yard run for a 10-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first play of Hart's next possession, Iacenda, the area's all-time 
scoring leader, dropped a handoff. He no doubt was distracted by 6-foot-4, 
222-pound Caleb Smith flashing through the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith recovered, and Shrout kicked a 28-yard field goal for a 13-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Iacenda then fumbled again, Smith recovered again, and Shrout kicked a 43-yard 
field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound like a broken record? Call it sweet music for the underdog Antelopes. 
And the party was just starting. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart got the ball back and held onto it, but couldn't move it. After a punt, 
Lewis scampered 61 yards on second down -- slipping through the arms of 
defensive back Doug Satterfield -- and scored for a 22-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon then threw another interception, this one by Tony Walker, who weaved 48 
yards into the hart end zone. He shot to the Hart sideline, then cut back to 
the middle of the field and jumped over McKeon, spinning in the air as if 
pirouetting at the 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't say anything," Walker said. "But I know he probably saw my cleats." 
</P>
<P>
 Shrout's extra-point kick made it 29-0 at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're definitely the best defensive team we've seen this year," McKeon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart could never recover, though it outplayed the Antelopes in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians opened the third quarter with Chris McCabe recovering an onside 
kick. It led to a spectacular 28-yard touchdown pass from McKeon to J.B. 
Nelson. Nelson caught the ball over his shoulder in the corner of the end zone 
with Walker draped all over him. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through the fourth quarter, McKeon found Nelson (four catches, 137 
yards) wide open for 57 yards. Walker dragged him down at the two, but Iacenda 
scored his 41st touchdown on the next play then added a two-point conversion 
run to make it 29-15. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hart couldn't stop the Antelopes from scoring again. Lewis capped an 
11-play, 80-yard drive by throwing a 38-yard halfback pass to Walker. There 
wasn't a defender from here to Lancaster and Walker carried the Antelopes' 
title across the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was doubting us," said Walker of Antelope Valley's underdog status. 
"I'm not surprised."

NO LONG LAYOFF FOR DE LA HOYA; BOXING: LESS THAN A MONTH AFTER HIS LAST FIGHT, 
HE WILL TAKE ON AVILA AT THE GRAND OLYMPIC TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Trying to establish order in a young career where flash has sometimes 
overshadowed substance, Oscar De La Hoya takes an important step in tailoring a 
blue-collar work ethic at noon today when he defends his World Boxing 
Organization lightweight title against Johnny Avila in a 12-round bout at the 
Grand Olympic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be the second bout in less than a month for De La Hoya (15-0, 14 KOs), 
who scored an impressive third-round knockout against Carl Griffith on Nov. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya, 21, has not strung bouts so closely together since fighting twice 
within a 13-day span in August of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 He only took three days off after the victory against Griffith before resuming 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what I've always wanted to do, fight constantly," De La Hoya said this 
week. "Keep myself in shape and keep myself out of trouble. I want to go to Big 
Bear, train hard and get my boxing career over with." 
</P>
<P>
 The Avila fight was originally scheduled for Oct. 8, but De La Hoya had to 
pull out because of a virus. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, it was always something. Last year at this time, De La Hoya was 
going through a nasty divorce with his former management team. He did not fight 
for a four-month period from Oct. 30, 1993 to March 5, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's done with," De La Hoya said of those dark days. 
</P>
<P>
 It appears the De La Hoya train is securely on track, with upcoming bouts 
scheduled for January and February leading to a May showdown against Rafael 
Ruelas, the International Boxing Federation lightweight champion. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya appears aware that his "Golden Boy" image can be counterproductive. 
This week he was humble at his prefight news conference, even respectful of his 
opponent, Avila. That was in contrast to his behavior before the Griffith 
fight, when De La Hoya boldly claimed his opponent would not land a punch. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a tough fighter, he's not scared of no one," De La Hoya said of Avila 
(20-1-1). "Maybe it's been so, that some fighters have had a bit of fear going 
against me, but I want to fight, I want to brawl, I want to show what I have." 
</P>
<P>
 Avila, a fighter raised in Palmdale but who made his name in Reno, said 
opponents do not appreciate being considered notches on De La Hoya's title 
belt. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overlooking people, you can do it, and get away with it, but that comes back 
on you," Avila said. "That's being cocky, arrogant, too self-confident." 
</P>
<P>
 Although they are not close, Avila and De La Hoya are relatives. "My aunt was 
married to Oscar's dad," Avila said. 
</P>
<P>
 Avila, 21, who has been boxing for only three years, said most opponents are 
psyched out by De La Hoya before they step in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, he's just another person," Avila said. "That's all Oscar is. He won 
the gold medal. I guess that's what makes him so special." 
</P>
<P>
 His strategy against De La Hoya? 
</P>
<P>
 "Oscar is quick, so I'm going to have to be quicker," he said. "Oscar can 
punch, I'll have to punch harder. He can box, so I'm going to have to box a 
little better." 
</P>
<P>
 And if Avila wins? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be fighting Ruelas," he said. Fight Notes 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya has donated $50,000 of his $150,000 purse to purchase about 1,000 
seats today for the Boy Scouts of America. Avila's purse is $30,000. On the 
undercard, 1992 Olympian Pepe Reilly (10-1-0, nine KOs) meets Antonio Ojeda 
(6-9, five KOs) in matchup of junior-welterweights. Reilly is trained by Robert 
Alcazar, who also trains De La Hoya. "Pepe has made a lot of progress," Alcazar 
said. "In this fight, he'll have an opportunity to prove to himself, and to the 
people in his hometown, that he's ready to go to the next level." . . . In a 
lightweight bout, Robert Garcia (17-0,13 KOs) takes on Roberto Villarreal 
(17-5-1, 11 KOs). The undercard begins at 11 a.m.

THE NFL / BILL PLASCHKE; VIKINGS' SUCCESS SHOULD FORCE NFL'S HAND ON BLACKS

<P>
 Not everyone in the NFL is giddy over parity these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Not here, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Minnesota Vikings are in first place in their division and are considered 
the only NFC team with any chance of keeping the Dallas Cowboys or San 
Francisco 49ers from the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet they are doing it with a face that makes some executives squirm. 
</P>
<P>
 They have an African-American coach who was one of only 12 rookie coaches in 
NFL history to lead his team to the playoffs in each of his first two seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 And an African-American quarterback who leads the league's second-ranking 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
 And an African-American defensive coordinator who oversees the league's 
sixth-ranking defense and is considered one of the league's top head coaching 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 The farther the Vikings advance in the playoffs, the more other teams will 
have to look in a mirror. And the better the odds that those teams will finally 
realize what they are seeing. 
</P>
<P>
 Parity, asks Warren Moon? What kind of parity is there when only five of the 
league's 84 quarterbacks are African American? 
</P>
<P>
 Parity, wonders Tony Dungy? What kind of parity is there when there has never 
been an African-American offensive or defensive coordinator who has been 
promoted to head coach, even though many coaches come from those ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 Parity, asks Dennis Green? Then he says nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 As one of only two African-American head coaches in a league in which African 
Americans represent about 65% of the players, he knows that his work will be 
heard more loudly than his talk. 
</P>
<P>
 Moon, who has kept quiet for much of his 10-year NFL career, works 
differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is going on with African-American quarterbacks still bothers me," he 
said. "Unlike white quarterbacks, this league does not allow African-American 
quarterbacks to develop. Either we start right away, or we get shipped off to 
Canada." 
</P>
<P>
 Moon's point is that although three of the league's 28 starters are African 
American -- he, Randall Cunningham of the Philadelphia Eagles and Jeff Blake of 
the Cincinnati Bengals -- only three of the league's 56 backups are black -- 
Rodney Peete of the Dallas Cowboys, Jay Walker of the New England Patriots and 
Vince Evans of the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Backups become more than just starters. Backups become assistant coaches who 
later become head coaches. Backups learn about schemes and decisions and 
philosophies better than anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Backups work the headsets, and when is the last time you've seen an 
African-American player wearing a headset? 
</P>
<P>
 "That is the only way to become successful in his league, is to be given time 
to develop," said Moon, who developed in the Canadian Football League. "Yet for 
some reason, we don't want to give young blacks that time." 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Williams, former Super Bowl most valuable player while quarterback for 
the Washington Redskins, put it another way. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Jay Schroeder were black, he would not still be in this league," said 
Williams, now an assistant coach at Navy. "I'm glad to finally see Warren 
looking at this issue from that standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
 Moon not only talks about it, he has phoned Steve McNair, Alcorn State's star 
quarterback, and offered his advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to let him know what he has to deal with," Moon said. "I want to pass 
him the torch, the way Doug Williams passed it to me." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most fair-minded of NFL powerbrokers -- George Young of the New 
York Giants -- does not quite agree with Moon and Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "White people do dumb things, and say dumb things, and are sometimes 
insensitive, I understand that," Young said. "But I tell you one thing: Coaches 
are selfish. They will play people they don't like if they think they have a 
chance to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "Black, white or gray, one thing all coaches have in common is that they like 
to make their house payments." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no torch that can be passed to Dungy, who has done splendid work with 
three defenses -- Pittsburgh, Kansas City and the Vikings -- yet has never been 
given more than a token job interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have learned that you don't get jobs through interviews," he said. 
"Somebody has to like you. They have to call you and tell you they want you to 
be the coach. Then you come in and interview and work things out." 
</P>
<P>
 That has never happened to Dungy, even though he has been mentioned 
prominently for several jobs over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 There could be as many as half a dozen openings in February. Because 
championship teams are now being built on defense, Dungy, renowned for his 
defenses, would be perfect for some of them. 
</P>
<P>
 But he's not holding his breath. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I'm just hardened, but I know that jobs aren't given on merit," he 
said. "It's . . . the perception of the owners. You ask them, who is an NFL 
coach, and they think of (Vince) Lombardi, (George) Halas, Paul Brown. Their 
perception is that they want a guy like that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their impression is that a head coach is a 45- to 50-year-old white guy." 
</P>
<P>
 And that is not Dungy, who looks like a CEO, thinks like a professor, and 
turns 40 next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Tony Dungy deserves a shot, and I think he will get one, because he 
has paid his dues like any coach of any color," Young said. "I don't think 
owners are preoccupied with color, especially during these times. The problem 
is that you look around, and there just aren't that many black head coaches at 
any level." 
</P>
<P>
 In college football, there are four black head coaches in Division I-A. 
Ironically, the most recent hire came from Green's Viking staff. Tyrone 
Willingham, who coached the Viking running backs, has just succeeded Bill Walsh 
at Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 "When looking for an NFL coach, you look at your choices, and it becomes a 
numbers game," Young said. "How many blacks are there to choose from?" 
</P>
<P>
 Plenty more soon, one thinks, if the Minnesota Vikings remain successful. At 
the risk of losing our objectivity, we think that makes them worth cheering 
for. MONK 
</P>
<P>
 The skinny on the record that will probably be broken today when the New York 
Jets' Art Monk catches a pass in his 178th consecutive game: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The streak has lasted three times as long as the average career, more than 
11 years. It began Oct. 2, 1983, against the Raiders in Washington when Monk 
was with the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The man whose record he will be breaking, Steve Largent, is an Oklahoma 
Republican who was recently elected to the U.S. Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Largent, who caught all his passes for the Seattle Seahawks, said his new game 
is rougher than football. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody throws a flag for unsportsmanlike conduct when they hit you in the 
back," he said of politics. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Ram defense came the closest to ending the streak, in Anaheim a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing for the Redskins, Monk didn't catch a pass until 1:40 remained in the 
game, when Rich Gannon found him for a four-yard completion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got to the point where I didn't think I would catch one in that game," 
Monk said. 
</P>
<P>
 To Monk's credit, it was not a charity toss. The Redskins were driving for the 
go-ahead score in a game they eventually lost, 10-6. 
</P>
<P>
 -- After spending his first 14 years with the Redskins, Monk will set the 
record in a Jet uniform because of bad judgment by the Redskins and an 
intrusion by former Ram Henry Ellard. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, Monk turned down the Redskins' one-year offer of $600,000. The 
Redskins then signed free-agent Ellard for $900,000. 
</P>
<P>
 When Monk realized he wouldn't get much more money elsewhere, he returned to 
the Redskins and said he would play for the $600,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, they said. Their wide receiver money was spent. So he signed with the 
Jets for $575,000. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The second-longest active streak is held by Jerry Rice of the San Francisco 
49ers, who is at 140 games and counting. 
</P>
<P>
 "That doesn't bode well for Art," Largent said. THE MEN FROM THE BOYS 
</P>
<P>
 Watching the contenders in the final weeks of an NFL season is a bit like 
watching your car being washed. The process reveals both the dents and the 
shiny parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Shiny: Steve Young of the San Francisco 49ers has helped account for 16 
touchdowns in their last four games -- 13 passing and three rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle between the 49ers and Dallas Cowboys will pale in comparison to the 
MVP duel between Young and Dan Marino. 
</P>
<P>
 Dented: In five games, the Green Bay Packer defense has allowed an average of 
27 points. They have not recovered a fumble in a month. 
</P>
<P>
 This week they announced that all media access would be reduced by more than 
50%. Just as we figured. It's all our fault. 
</P>
<P>
 Shiny: Andre Reed, Buffalo receiver, has caught 355 yards' worth of passes in 
the last four games and scored four touchdowns. Jim Kelly should cuss him out 
on the sidelines more often. 
</P>
<P>
 Dented: In his last three games, Jeff George of the Atlanta Falcons has 
completed barely 50% of his passes -- 60 for 118 -- with seven touchdowns and 
five interceptions. New team, old stripes. 
</P>
<P>
 Shiny: Bam Morris, the Pittsburgh Steeler rookie running back, has gained 511 
yards and scored five touchdowns in the last six games he has played. At that 
pace, if he had played all season, he would rank third in the AFC in rushing, 
ahead of even Marshall Faulk. 
</P>
<P>
 Dented: Joe Montana hasn't thrown a touchdown pass to a wide receiver since 
before Halloween. 
</P>
<P>
 Shiny: Emmitt Smith of the Dallas Cowboys has scored 10 touchdowns in the last 
five games. He would trade them all for a chance to catch Barry Sanders and win 
his fourth consecutive rushing title. Which won't happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Dented: Bernie Parmalee, Miami Dolphin running back, has averaged 2.5 yards a 
carry in the last three games, with 92 rushing yards and no touchdowns. A nice 
story while it lasted. 
</P>
<P>
 Shiny: John Elway of the Denver Broncos has completed 65% of his passes in his 
last three games for 877 yards, four touchdowns and one interception. Coach 
Wade Phillips told his team that Elway, suffering from a knee injury, will not 
play against the Raiders Sunday except in an emergency. And we're Red Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Dented: Boomer Esiason of the New York Jets has thrown as many interceptions, 
three, as touchdown passes in the last two games while completing only 52% of 
his passes. His reputation as a three-quarter quarterback lives on. 
</P>
<P>
 Shiny: Dave Krieg of the Detroit Lions has thrown 10 touchdown passes with no 
interceptions -- that is not a misprint -- since replacing injured Scott 
Mitchell five games ago. He is doing it with the same offense that Mitchell 
couldn't learn. 
</P>
<P>
 Dented: Since gaining 273 yards in his first two games this season, running 
back Charlie Garner of the Philadelphia Eagles has gained 113 yards in his last 
eight. He will only become a top running back when he realizes that top running 
backs play hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 Shiny: Fuad Reveiz of the Minnesota Vikings has connected on 16 consecutive 
field goals. The best kicker nobody knows. 
</P>
<P>
 Dented: After scoring eight touchdowns in the first six games, running back 
Natrone Means of the San Diego Chargers has scored once in the last seven. 
Since rushing for 100 yards in five consecutive games, Means hasn't 
accomplished that feat in a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't blame him, blame his battered offensive line. There are not enough weeks 
in the season for them to get strong again. Could it be that the Chargers will 
not win another game? 
</P>
<P>
 Shiny: The New England Patriot defense, after allowing opponents to gain at 
least 300 yards in nine of the first 10 games, has held its last three 
opponents under 300 yards. Bill Parcells back in the playoffs? Has he ever done 
a better coaching job? 
</P>
<P>
 Dented: Quarterback Vinny Testaverde of the Cleveland Browns has committed 
four turnovers in two games, and 16 of the team's 29. 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) QUICK HITTERS 
</P>
<P>
 * NAIL-BITING TIME: With three weeks remaining, 25 of the 28 NFL teams are in 
the running for playoff berths, an NFL record for this late in the season. 
</P>
<P>
 * TOUGH NIGHT: Poor Al Davis. During his finest moment this season, with his 
Raiders using his name as their inspiration to intimidate the San Diego 
Chargers, a couple of things happened that might make him want to forget Monday 
night: 
</P>
<P>
 -- During pregame drills, Charger wide receiver Tony Martin flattened Davis 
along the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 -- During the game, while getting a hot dog, Davis slipped on the floor and 
banged his knee. 
</P>
<P>
 * THAT SAME ANIMAL HAS BEEN SPOTTED AT ANAHEIM STADIUM: New England Coach Bill 
Parcells, on the reason he ordered more passes earlier this year while his 
running game struggled: "I don't think I have to get hit in the face with a 
skunk four times before I smell it." 
</P>
<P>
 * HE'S BACK: Former USC quarterback Sean Salisbury, released by the Houston 
Oilers when he declined to take a salary cut after a nightmare training camp, 
has resurfaced as Warren Moon's sideline confidant with the Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Salisbury is a third-stringer behind Brad Johnson, Moon seeks 
Salisbury out for advice and support during games. Salisbury suggests 
everything from mechanical changes to plays. 
</P>
<P>
 Salisbury is considered by many to be a top quarterback coach candidate, but 
he says he is not ready to retire. When looking for a veteran influence, the 
two expansion teams could certainly do worse. 
</P>
<P>
 * THE OTHERS: A list of the league's other top sideline quarterbacks: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Bernie Kosar, Miami Dolphins. It was Kosar who invented and called the fake 
spike play that led to Dan Marino's winning touchdown pass against the New York 
Jets a couple of weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Jim Harbaugh, Indianapolis Colts. This son of a college coach has accepted 
his benching well. Last week he ran onto the field to replace injured Don 
Majkowski, handed the ball to Marshall Faulk on his first play, watched Faulk 
run 45 yards for a touchdown, then returned to the sideline for the rest of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Mike Tomczak, Pittsburgh Steelers. Smarter than the starter, that's for 
sure. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Steve Bono, Kansas City Chiefs. Those photos of him huddling with Joe 
Montana will be worth money some day. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Vince Evans, Raiders. Fulfills the Raiders' sole requirement for their 
backup quarterback. Nobody else can break up a sideline fistfight or shouting 
match like this guy.

 Peter Angelos, controlling partner of the Baltimore Orioles, met for more than 
two hours Friday with trustees trying to sell the Tampa Bay Buccaneers and 
reported "substantial progress" in his effort to buy the team and move it to 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had some very fruitful discussions and they will continue," Angelos said. 
"We are making substantial progress." 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos has also been negotiating to purchase a minority interest in the Rams 
and move them to Baltimore, but he admitted his city has fallen behind St. 
Louis in the race for the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, St. Louis is substantially in the lead," Angelos said. "But I 
don't think it's a done deal. That can change overnight."

 On the Raiders' depth chart, Alberto White is listed at right defensive end 
behind Anthony Smith and Aundray Bruce. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last four games, however, White has made his presence known as a 
pass-rush specialist.His pressure on quarterbacks played a key role in the 
Raider victories over the Rams, New Orleans and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for a player who was on the practice roster for the first nine games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alberto brings tenacity," Coach Art Shell said Friday. "He has great 
quickness with speed to get up the field and apply pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 White, who has only two tackles, including one 10-yard sack, was a 10th-round 
pick with the Raiders from Texas Southern in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The offensive line received good news Friday, when the NFL office erased a 
sack from last Monday's game at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, Junior Seau of the Chargers was given a sack when he tackled 
quarterback Jeff Hostetler for a five-yard loss on the Raiders' final play. 
</P>
<P>
 After review, however, the play was ruled a run by Hostetler.

 The annual Toys for Tots drive, sponsored by the Raiders and the U.S. Marine 
Corps, will be held Sunday at the Coliseum before the Raiders play Denver. Fans 
are encouraged to bring new unwrapped toys to the Coliseum gates. . . . 
Cornerback Lionel Washington, who has sat out three games because of a lower 
leg injury, did not practice Friday. . . . With 1,044 yards receiving, Tim 
Brown has topped the 1,000-yard mark two consecutive seasons. Brown needs seven 
catches to tie his Raider single-season mark for wide receivers with 80. LONNIE

 The Rams, who have struggled with punt returns in the last two games, now have 
to deal with one of the league's best coverage teams Sunday in Tampa Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The Buccaneers have given up a league-low 42 yards in punt returns, leading 
the league by 123 yards over second-place Chicago.The league average is 279.5 
yards. The Rams have given up 526 yards in 38 returns. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last nine games, Tampa Bay punter Dan Stryzinksi has punted 40 times, 
forcing 25 fair catches, and had only nine punts returned against him for 12 
yards. The longest return against him this season is nine yards, nearly four 
yards less than Ram opponents are averaging. 
</P>
<P>
 Has Ram punter Sean Landeta, a 10-year veteran, ever seen a team hold 
opponents to less than 100 return yards in a season? 
</P>
<P>
 "When I played for the Stars in the USFL in 1984, we allowed 73 yards in 18 
games, which is probably a record," he said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Starting defensive tackle Jimmie Jones (ankle) is listed as probable for the 
game. . . . The Rams put wide receiver Isaac Bruce (knee) on the injured 
reserve list and promoted tight end Rickey Brady to the 53-man roster. Brady 
will be inactive for Sunday's game along with quarterback Jamie Martin, 
offensive tackle Ron Edwards and linebacker Henry Rolling. MIKE REILLEY

 With major college football over until the bowls, the pros take over Saturdays 
for the next three weeks. Today's schedule pits the Detroit Lions at the New 
York Jets, followed by the Cleveland Browns at the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first things Boomer Esiason will do is throw a pass to Art Monk. 
Then he will have to get his other receivers involved against the Lions (7-6) 
to keep the Jets (6-7) in the playoff race. 
</P>
<P>
 Monk will set the NFL record of 178 consecutive games with a catch when he 
makes one against the Lions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets will try to keep the ball away from Barry Sanders, who leads the NFL 
with 1,594 rushing yards. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the Browns (9-4) beat the Cowboys, they will need only a Denver loss or tie 
against the Raiders, a Buffalo loss or tie against Minnesota, or a Kansas City 
loss or tie against Miami to clinch a wild-card berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Vinny Testaverde spent six playoff-less seasons in balmy Tampa and wouldn't 
mind enduring the trying Cleveland elements after the New Year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be the first time in my career I would be out there on the field in 
the playoffs instead of sitting home watching," he said. "That would mean a lot 
to me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys (11-2), who are already in the playoffs, can clinch a first round 
NFC bye in the Dec. 31-Jan. 1 games with a victory. 
</P>

 Dallas quarterback Troy Aikman, nursing a sprained left knee ligament the last 
two weeks while Jason Garrett and Rodney Peete won games, will start.

 Florida Coach Steve Spurrier has spurned overtures from the Carolina Panthers, 
meaning the expansion team has lost its top two prospects for the head coaching 
job. Former Washington Redskin Coach Joe Gibbs turned down the job in February, 
then reiterated that stance last week. . . . The lawyer for paralyzed Seattle 
Seahawk player Mike Frier said that Lamar Smith, not star running back Chris 
Warren, was driving the car that slammed into a utility pole and injured all 
three. . . . Miami Dolphin Coach Don Shula missed a regular-season practice for 
the first time in 25 years Friday when he underwent surgery to repair a 
ruptured right Achilles' tendon.

 Andre Agassi lost to Magnus Larsson, 6-3, 1-6, 6-0, in the quarterfinals of 
the Compaq Grand Slam Cup at Munich, Germany, on Friday, but not before losing 
his temper and nearly getting disqualified from the $6-million tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 In another quarterfinal, Todd Martin beat Sergi Bruguera, the French Open 
champion, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5). 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi tangled with umpire Mike Morrisey of Britain in the first set. Agassi 
received a warning and was penalized a point when he repeated an obscenity, 
giving Larsson a break and a 3-1 lead in the set. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said it again but he wouldn't default me," Agassi said of Morrisey. After a 
player is penalized a point for a code of conduct violation, the next breach 
usually causes a default.

 Commissioner Gary Bettman rejected a request from union chief Bob Goodenow 
that the NHL reconsider its proposed payroll tax and said Goodenow's evaluation 
of the negotiations leaves him "quite pessimistic about our ability to make a

 Goodenow, in a letter to Bettman on Thursday, said concessions made by the 
union had brought them close to a deal that would create significant savings 
for owners and make a tax unnecessary. He asserted the tax would act as a 
salary cap and added, "In these circumstances, it should be clear that we will 
not negotiate a tax system with you."

BOXING / CHRIS DUFRESNE; CHAVEZ BEGINS HIS GOING-AWAY PARTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tonight marks the beginning of the end for the redoubtable Julio Cesar Chavez, 
who starts on the trail to retirement in Monterrey, Mexico, when he meets Tony 
(the Tiger) Lopez in a pay-per-view fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez, in fact, has already ordered the party balloons and sent out the 
invitations. 
</P>
<P>
 It is rare in sport -- especially in boxing -- when an athlete gets to choose 
the time and place of his retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, Chavez is not your average palooka. An almost God-like figure in 
his homeland, the six-time world champion and current World Boxing Council 
super-lightweight champion from Culiacan, Mexico, now embarks on a seven-fight 
slugfest to the finish. 
</P>
<P>
 The first page of this final chapter will be turned tonight with Chavez's 94th 
fight. It will end, if all goes according to plan, a year from now with a 
landmark 100th bout, a rematch against Frankie Randall, the man who dealt 
Chavez his only defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 For Chavez (91-1-1), this is about tying up bows and loose ends. 
</P>
<P>
 He has even offered to hang around for a 101st fight, against Pernell 
Whitaker, who fought Chavez to a 1993 draw in San Antonio, a match many thought 
Whitaker won. 
</P>
<P>
 "No. 101 will be to clear up all doubts," Chavez said through an interpreter 
this week from Mexico. "I'm closing the book at 100, to redeem the loss to 
Frankie Randall. But I'll fight Whitaker to clear the air, just for the fans." 
</P>
<P>
 The Whitaker camp considers such talk bluster, claiming Whitaker would fight 
Chavez tomorrow in a phone booth. The hitch, claims Shelly Finkel, Whitaker's 
manager, is that Don King insists that Whitaker fight a series of King's boxers 
to get to Chavez. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is, Chavez doesn't want to fight him," Finkel said. "We said 
we'd fight all those other guys, but we want Chavez first." 
</P>
<P>
 Orchestrated farewell tours are fine in other sports, but more of a risk in 
boxing, where one punch can ruin a caterer's plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The worry is that Chavez might not have enough gas in the tank to survive 
until No. 100. 
</P>
<P>
 Once thought invincible, there have been chinks in the armor of late. Even 
some longtime supporters have come to doubt him. Chavez was 87-0 -- an 
early-career disqualification loss had long since been reversed -- when he 
fought Whitaker to a controversial draw in 1993. Then he lost to Randall last 
Jan. 29, quickly followed by a May rematch in which Chavez was awarded a 
split-decision victory after an accidental head-butt by Randall had ended the 
fight in the eighth round. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven boxers stand in the way of Chavez and his date with destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 But do any of them fear Chavez as they once might have? 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, a former three-time world champion, does not consider himself anyone's 
party favor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I'll be finishing his tour for him," Lopez said. "I'm here to do one 
thing. I'm not here to run from the man, I'm here to take something from him." 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez denies that his skills have diminished. He says he will retire on his 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "People should stop talking about old men in the ring," Chavez said. "Look at 
what George Foreman proved. He's 46. I'm only 32. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not that I am old that I will retire. I'm retiring because everyone has 
their own time, and I know when my time will come, and that is the end of '95. 
I want to retire with my complete faculties intact. It is not because I am 
old."

 Can Oscar De La Hoya save the Olympic? 
</P>
<P>
 It is a lot to ask of the one they call "Golden Boy," yet promoters are hoping 
De La Hoya's afternoon CBS fight today against Johnny Avila can provide the 
attendance jolt needed to revive what has been a disappointing first year of 
operation for the renovated Grand Olympic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Olympic's two-year contract with Top Rank, Inc., Bob Arum's company, 
called for 25 cards a year, but the Olympic will fall well short of that. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's card will be the 13th. 
</P>
<P>
 The Olympic has not approached its gala opening-night crowd of 4,060 last 
March, when De La Hoya also was the headliner. Only one card since has drawn 
more than 2,000. According to the California Athletic Commission's figures, 
three of the 12 cards have drawn fewer than 1,000, with a low of 715 on Sept. 
9. 
</P>
<P>
 Top Rank's Todd duBoef said the De La Hoya fight will be a good barometer of 
the future of boxing in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without doubt," he said. "We'll see if the spark is back. People always 
talked about the old Olympic, with (Carlos) Palomino and (Art) Aragon. I've got 
to believe De La Hoya or the Ruelas brothers have got to be in that same 
sentence." 
</P>
<P>
 Promoters are perplexed because televised boxing continues to draw strong 
ratings locally. 
</P>
<P>
 The undercard for the recent Riddick Bowe-Larry Donald fight in Las Vegas, 
promoted by Forum Boxing and televised by Channel 9, got an outstanding 6.8 
rating. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Needleman, owner of the Olympic, said boxing's popularity has not 
translated to live gate. 
</P>
<P>
 "TV dictates boxing," Needleman said. "Live gate is secondary to pay-per-view, 
secondary to Las Vegas wanting gamblers to come in. Live gates on boxing, 
nationally, are down. We are not drawing crowds like we or Top Rank expected. 
But I don't think anywhere in L.A. are they drawing what was originally 
anticipated." 
</P>
<P>
 Though it's obvious the Olympic will not reach 25 bouts this year, Needleman 
said the terms of the contract with Top Rank are negotiable. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said he expects a crowd of 2,500-3,000 for today's fight. 
</P>

 News flash: Roy Jones Jr. is moving up to light-heavyweight. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't worry, James Toney, it's only in a movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, the International Boxing Federation super-middleweight champion, was in 
Las Vegas this week to shoot his scenes for "The Watcher," in which he plays 
Sonny Washington, light-heavyweight champion of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Toney, of course, is moving up to the light-heavyweight division after his 
super-middleweight loss to Jones in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Off screen, Jones says he would be willing to fight Gerald McClellan, the WBC 
middleweight champion, as long as terms don't include any long-term 
relationship with King, McClellan's promoter. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he gives me a decent offer, no ties, bring it on," Jones said of King. "A 
one-fight deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, 25, also suggested he was going to bounce between the 160- and 
168-pound divisions, and plans to reclaim the IBF middleweight crown he 
relinquished to fight Toney. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't expect Jones to relinquish his title as one of the least active 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Would you rather see me fight 10 times this year and be done, or perform for 
the next four or five years?" he asked. Boxing Notes

<P>
 Bowe-Donald III: Criminal charges have yet to be filed against heavyweight 
Riddick Bowe for punching Larry Donald twice in the face at a news conference 
at the Forum on Nov. 28 to promote their Dec. 3 fight. Donald filed a civil 
suit against Bowe in Los Angeles Superior Court on Dec. 2. Bowe was served 
papers after his 12-round unanimous decision over Donald at Caesars Palace. 
Roderick J. Lindblom, Donald's attorney, suggested criminal charges would be 
forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the week, though, neither the Inglewood city attorney's office, which 
would handle the case if it were a misdemeanor, or the L.A. District Attorney's 
office had received the case. "If it were filed as a felony, it would likely be 
filed in this office," Irwin Bloom, a deputy D.A. in the Inglewood office, 
said. "I have not heard of it being filed. It could still be under 
investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Lindblom said early this week that he wasn't sure what criminal action, if 
any, might be taken. He said Donald was taking time off to reassess the 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal is done: Bowe (35-1, 29 KOs) will fight World Boxing Organization 
champion Herbie Hide (26-0, 25 KOs) at the MGM Grand on March 11 in an HBO 
telecast. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for Pernell Whitaker, World Boxing Council welterweight champion, to 
fight three times in 1995, beginning in March, manager Shelly Finkel said. 
Whitaker may fight Julio Cesar Vasquez, the World Boxing Assn. 
junior-middleweight champion, or make a mandatory defense against Gary Jacobs, 
the WBC's No. 1 welterweight contender. 
</P>
<P>
 Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez, 28, hinted at retirement after his Nov. 12 
victory over Michael Carbajal, but that seems unlikely now. Expect one of three 
options: 1 -- Gonzalez defends his WBC and IBF light-flyweight championship 
against undefeated Ricardo Lopez, who wants to move up from strawweight. 2 -- 
Gonzalez moves up to 112 pounds to fight WBC champion Yuri Arbachakov, a 
Russian based in Japan. 3 -- Gonzalez tries to unify the 108-pound division by 
taking on Leo Gamez, the WBA champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Don King still hasn't found a home for the WBC heavyweight title match between 
Oliver McCall and Larry Holmes. King said he is negotiating with three Las 
Vegas hotels -- MGM, Caesars Palace and the Mirage -- for the Feb. 18 or March 
11 bout. Spain also remains a possibility. Calendar 
</P>
<P>
 Monday: Carlos (Bolillo) Gonzalez vs. Wilber Kiggundu, welterweights; Jorge 
Barrera vs. Narciso Rodriguez, flyweights; Miguel (Maikito) Martinez vs. 
Ventura Piedra Mendivil, light flyweights. Forum, 7:15 p.m.

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL / DIVISION II FINAL; HART GOES DOWN IN A ROUT, 36-15 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hart High's offense was a high-flying circus act -- a real headliner. 
</P>
<P>
 But before 8,000 at College of the Canyons on Friday night, Antelope Valley's 
defense stopped the show, posting a 36-15 rout to win the Southern Section 
Division II championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart (13-1), with an offense that scored 51 and 55 points in its two previous 
playoff games, might still be seeing dust from what will be remembered as a 
furious first-half Antelope stampede. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first 24 minutes, Hart committed five turnovers -- two fumbles and 
three interceptions -- and watched Antelope Valley (11-2) post a 29-0 lead at 
halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were pumped this whole week," said Antelope Valley tackle Chad Shrout, who 
sacked Hart quarterback Steve McKeon four times and kicked three field goals. 
"We studied their offense. We knew what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley defense blitzed McKeon, clogged the middle and shot 
through gaps to greet ballcarriers in the backfield. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians seemed flustered by their opponent's aggressiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 While Antelope Valley's defense did most of the damage, running back Jermaine 
Lewis had 207 of the team's 314 offensive yards. He rushed for 155 yards and 
one touchdown and passed for 52 and another touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon completed 24 of 41 passes for 364 yards, but Hart's best player, 
running back Ted Iacenda, was held to 60 yards in 13 carries. He never broke a 
long run. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Antelope Valley) has such speed in the secondary, they just fly up and make 
tackles," Hart offensive coordinator Dean Herrington said. "I'm sure it 
shellshocked us a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 After Shrout opened the scoring with a line-drive 45-yard field goal, Justin 
Reiner intercepted a McKeon pass near midfield. Six plays later, Lewis scored 
on a 10-yard run for a 10-0 lead.

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL / DIVISION I FINAL; BIG DAY ARRIVES FOR BISHOP AMAT, MATER 
DEI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SHEPARD, TIMES PREP SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 High school football in the Southland has grown in popularity in the 1990s, 
and games such as tonight's Division I championship matchup between La Puente 
Bishop Amat and Santa Ana Mater Dei are one reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Such games have helped improve attendance and gate revenues for the vast CIF 
Southern Section. The increased attention, however, has created dilemmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's game, for example, was scheduled for Cerritos College, but section 
officials hastily moved it to Anaheim Stadium to accommodate the expected crowd 
of 25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't make sense to hold a game at a stadium that holds 12,000 when you 
know twice as many people want to attend," said Dean Crowley, Southern Section 
commissioner. "Although our operating expenses will greatly increase, we never 
want to turn people away." 
</P>
<P>
 Kickoff was also moved from the normal 7:30 p.m. start to 7:40 because of a 
request by Channel 13, which is televising the game live. At least two radio 
stations will carry live broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's semifinal between Mater Dei and Los Alamitos was also moved to 
Anaheim Stadium, and a crowd of 30,065 -- fifth largest in section history -- 
attended. Mater Dei and Rialto Eisenhower drew 33,204 in the title game three 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Friday afternoon, 13,000 tickets had been sold and more will be 
available today at the stadium ticket office. Each team is 13-0 and has a lofty 
ranking. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Amat has been the area's top-ranked team by The Times all season and 
Mater Dei is No. 2. The schools are also traditional parochial powerhouses with 
large followings. This will be their first meeting since 1991, when Mater Dei 
won the regular-season finale, 24-6, to end an eight-game losing streak in the 
series. 
</P>
<P>
 The game features many of the area's most highly recruited players. Atop the 
list is Bishop Amat's Daylon McCutcheon, a 5-foot-10, 175-pound running back 
who has rushed for a school-record 2,265 yards and 26 touchdowns. As a 
defensive back, he has eight interceptions, including two returned for 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensively, the Lancers have held their opponents to a touchdown or less in 
nine games. Kory Minor, 6-3, 230, leads the team with 20 sacks, and Tom 
Gurrola, 5-10, 205, has 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei, which ended Los Alamitos' record 47-game unbeaten streak last week, 
is making its third appearance in the Division I championship in the last four 
years. The Monarchs defeated Rialto Eisenhower, 35-14, in 1991, but were routed 
by the same team last year, 56-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Bruce Rollinson was not optimistic about his team's chances earlier this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Daylon McCutcheon is the best player we've ever faced, and Bishop Amat may be 
the best team we've ever seen," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei is big and deep. Quarterback John Flynn has passed for 2,546 yards 
and 26 touchdowns, and running back Steve Bodnar has 1,723 yards and 26 
touchdowns. The holes are opened by an offensive line that averages 6-3, 257. 
</P>
<P>
 "Have you seen their size?" Bishop Amat Coach Tom Salter said. "We haven't 
faced anybody like them all season."

SYLMAR GOES FOR ANOTHER TITLE AGAINST CRENSHAW IN CITY 4-A 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sylmar High goes for its second City Section Division 4-A title in the last 
three years today, when it meets Crenshaw at El Camino College. Kickoff is at 
noon. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams last played each other in the quarterfinals in 1992, with Sylmar 
winning, 28-2. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-seeded Spartans (13-0) held on for a 28-27 overtime victory over 
Wilmington Banning in the quarterfinals on their way to the championship game. 
Crenshaw's closest call was a 26-19 victory over league rival Dorsey in last 
week's semifinal.

LEWIS HAS NO SMALL HAND IN ANTELOPE WIN; HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: LITTLE GUY MAKES 
BIG PLAYS IN SEVERAL ROLES AS HART GOES DOWN, 36-15. 
</P>

<P>
 At 5 feet 7, Antelope Valley High's Jermaine Lewis is always one of the 
smallest players on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 But the running back usually plays like one of the biggest. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night was no exception. Lewis had perhaps his finest all-around game in 
the Antelopes' 36-15 drubbing of Hart in the Southern Section Division II 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 First, there was the running. He slithered through the Indians' defense for 
155 yards in 23 carries. He had a 10-yard touchdown run in the first quarter on 
an option pitch from quarterback Trymon Redick. 
</P>
<P>
 He followed that with a 61-yard touchdown run in the second quarter, which 
gave the Antelopes a 22-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just one of the premier players in Southern California," Antelope Valley 
Coach Brent Newcomb said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis outplayed his Hart counterpart, Ted Iacenda, who entered the game with 
an area-record 40 touchdowns but fumbled twice in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lewis was not content with being one-dimensional. He also intercepted a 
pass by Hart quarterback Steve McKeon in the first half. He is one of the 
team's best defensive backs, though he rarely plays there because Newcomb 
prefers to rest him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't use him as much as I'd like," Newcomb said. "But I put him in. That's 
good coaching." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis wasn't through. He hadn't thrown a pass all season, but is the scout 
team quarterback in practice and Newcomb decided to make use of all of Lewis' 
talents. 
</P>
<P>
 So he called 29 green pitch, which calls for Lewis to take a pitch and pass 
the ball to Chad Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
 The play worked in the third quarter for a 19-yard gain on third down. And 
when the play was called again late in the game, Lewis took the ball and looked 
to Murphy. He was covered, so Lewis tucked the ball away as if he was going to 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Hart defense closed in, Lewis spotted Tony Walker open deep and 
heaved it just before he stepped out of bounds. It was a perfect pass, good for 
a 38-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know when we give the ball to Jermaine, something's going to happen," 
Redick said. "He's the greatest running back and the greatest friend a guy 
could have. He's got a lot of heart." 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the first two passes Lewis had thrown in a game since his freshman 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Lewis: "Coach said he wanted me to step up big. No one thought we could 
hang with Hart but we proved that wrong. It's the best feeling in the whole 
world." 
</P>
<P>
 When it was all over, he took another step, onto the team's bench to get a 
good look at the cheering Antelope Valley fans. 
</P>
<P>
 He held the championship plaque, kissed it, and broke into a grin of pure joy. 
Jermaine Lewis looked 10 feet tall.

 Boron 20, Morro Bay 16 -- Boron held off a late rally to win its second 
Division XI championship in a row at Morro Bay High. 
</P>
<P>
 Morro Bay's final drive ended at the Boron 20-yard line on Jason Sordelet's 
fumble with 38 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything just went wrong," said Sordelet, who finished with a game-high 160 
yards and a touchdown. "It just didn't happen tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Boron (11-1) scored on its first three possessions and took a 20-3 lead on a 
79-yard touchdown pass play from Nathan Judd to Ty Gifford early in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Fick, who scored Boron's first touchdown on two-yard run, finished with 
96 yards in 22 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Morro Bay, playing in its first championship, finished 10-2. ROB LEHOCKY

SNOW TO UNDERGO SHOULDER SURGERY; BASEBALL: ANGEL FIRST BASEMAN WILL MISS THE 
OPENING OF SPRING TRAINING. PLANS TO INCLUDE HIM IN TRADE ARE ON HOLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel first baseman J.T. Snow was diagnosed Friday with a torn cartilage in 
his left shoulder and a slight tear of his rotator cuff that will cause him to 
miss the opening of spring training. 
</P>
<P>
 Snow, who will undergo surgery Thursday, will be sidelined at least two 
months. He was informed that he might not be ready to play until late February 
or early March. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who knows," Snow said, "the way it looks, spring training might not start on 
time anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not too concerned. In a couple of months, I should be fully recovered. At 
least we know this will take care of it, and I'll definitely be ready by the 
start of the season." 
</P>
<P>
 Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi, however, was cautious about Snow's 
prognosis. 
</P>
<P>
 "This concerns me," Bavasi said. "It's still surgery. Anytime a doctor does 
something surgically, it makes me feel uncomfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "What concerns me is that we're talking about a guy who needs a lot of things 
to go right. We have some faith in the guy but you hate for him to go through 
this agony, and now this is one more thing we have to overcome." 
</P>
<P>
 The news of Snow's injury ends any notions the Angels had of trading Snow. The 
Angels shopped Snow at the general managers' meetings, and talked of putting 
him in a trade package. Now, any deal will be put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 If Snow's progress is delayed, the Angels have several options at first base. 
They can sign free agent Mickey Tettleton, or try Eduardo Perez, Jim Edmonds or 
Garret Anderson at first base. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels still are hoping Perez will be their everyday third baseman, but he 
has struggled defensively in winter ball in Puerto Rico, and several scouts 
insist Perez will have to be moved to first base. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still committed to giving him a shot at third base," Bavasi said. "It 
may not always look pretty, but he gets the ball there." 
</P>
<P>
 Snow, who spent the first two months of the 1994 season with triple-A 
Vancouver, batted .220 with eight homers and drove in 30 runs in 61 games. He 
wound up starting more games at first than any other Angel during the season. 
</P>
<P>
 He went to Venezuela in October to play winter ball, but suffered his shoulder 
injury about a month ago when he dived for a ball while playing left field. He 
left Venezuela when his shoulder failed to improve, but it was considered only 
a sprain until Dr. Lewis Yocum discovered the tears Friday while examining the 
magnetic resonance imaging test. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to get down about this," said Snow, who never has undergone 
surgery. "I'm not looking at it in a bad way. I went down to Venezuela to 
improve myself, so I'm not going to second-guess that decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like this is major surgery or anything." 
</P>
<P>
 In other news Friday, the Angels offered to trade center fielder Chad Curtis 
to the San Diego Padres for right-handed pitcher Andy Ashby. The proposal, 
according to a club source, was rejected by the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, former Angel center fielder Gary Pettis was hired to become their roving 
base-running instructor and Steve Renko was hired as pitching coach at Class-A 
Cedar Rapids.

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL / ROUNDUP; ALTA LOMA CONTAINS CHAFFEY IN 24-0 VICTORY 
</P>

<P>
 Rancho Cucamonga Alta Loma limited Ontario Chaffey to 126 yards total offense 
to claim the Southern Section Division VI championship with a 24-0 victory 
Friday night at Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a packed crowd of 4,500, Alta Loma Coach Tim Nelson was carried off the 
field by his team after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Credit the defense with a superb effort," said Nelson, whose team finished 
10-4 after an 0-4 start. "It feels great winning Alta Loma's first ever CIF 
championship." 
</P>
<P>
 Alta Loma opened the scoring in the second quarter when running back Keith 
Starks broke loose on a 49-yard run. Two possessions later, quarterback Aaron 
Gallegos connected with Craig Brooks on a 26-touchdown pass to increase the 
lead to 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Starks led the game with 117 yards in 11 carries. Gallegos completed five of 
11 passes for 77 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaffey running back Mike Rodriguez was held to 55 yards in 13 carries and 
Eddie Badibanga was held to 41 yards in 16 carries. The Taggers' deepest 
penetration was to the Alta Loma 15-yard line early in the first quarter. WILL

SOUTHERN SECTION FOOTBALL PLAYOFFS NCAA VOLLEYBALL REGIONALS; HE CAN'T RECALL 
SOME GAMES, BUT HE'LL NEVER FORGET ONE; DIVISION I: MATER DEI'S BODNAR IS 
HAUNTED -- AND DRIVEN -- BY HUMILIATION AT HANDS OF RIALTO EISENHOWER IN LAST 
YEAR'S CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Yes, Steve Bodnar does remember football games, one anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 This will come as a shock to his Mater Dei teammates. He's known around the 
weight room as the running back with a short attention span, at least when it 
comes to his and the Monarchs' past performances. 
</P>
<P>
 One day a group of players was talking about the Hawthorne victory. Bodnar, 
dead serious, looked at them and asked, "When did we play Hawthorne?"  
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, he was told. 
</P>
<P>
 So pardon those who don't believe Bodnar can retain a football memory beyond 
his last tackle-breaking, high-stepping run. But, really fellas, there is one 
game. It's etched on his mind . . . 56-3. 
</P>
<P>
 If ever there were a time for post-game amnesia, it was after last year's 
Southern Section Division I championship game debacle against Rialto 
Eisenhower. But it's the one memory that still haunts Bodnar. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was utter disappointment," said Bodnar, a senior. "It was crushing. I only 
have one dream, getting that championship ring. We were so close, yet so far." 
</P>
<P>
 He's close again. Bodnar and the Monarchs (13-0) play top-seeded La Puente 
Bishop Amat (13-0) tonight in the Division I final at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The year has passed quickly for Bodnar. He has been the Monarchs' starting 
tailback from start to finish for the first time. He has thrived in the 
limelight, with 1,723 yards rushing and 26 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that he remembers any of it. Bodnar is not one for reveling or wallowing 
in the past. Things he does remember aren't always all that pleasant -- his 
father's death when he was in the eighth grade and the pain getting over it. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was long ago. A lot of forgotten football games have passed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does hit me now and then," Bodnar said. "Sometimes, during games, I'll 
wish that my dad could be seeing this. But what happens, happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Bodnar won't dwell in the past, for good or bad. The present is here and the 
future is coming. This kid is focused. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tough on Steve," said Stella Bodnar, his mother. "But he's the type 
who will go forward. Basically, he does what he has to do and, when it's done, 
he moves on to something else." 
</P>
<P>
 He has moved on to a successful career at Mater Dei, one that no one could 
have predicted when he enrolled -- almost against his will -- in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Bodnar didn't play freshman football because he saw no point to it. There was 
no championship game. His mother said it was part of his recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 When he did play as a sophomore, Monarch Coach Bruce Rollinson was so 
flabbergasted, he chided his freshman coach for not informing him about this 
talented runner. Only then did he learn Bodnar had not played. Rollinson was 
determined to keep him, almost as determined as Bodnar was to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I look at Steve Bodnar and I see a lot of myself," Rollinson said. 
"I don't think I was as good a player as he is, but I watch him and I see Bruce 
Rollinson walking around." 
</P>
<P>
 With that thought, Rollinson sighed. He, too, lost his father a few years ago, 
and then his mother. He knows how focused one can become. 
</P>
<P>
 That is never more apparent than on the football field for Bodnar. 
</P>
<P>
 He is coming off what might be his biggest performance, gaining 178 yards and 
helping the Monarchs rally for a 28-24 victory over Los Alamitos in the 
semifinals. It was a game that tested his always-look-ahead philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 Bodnar was headed for a touchdown early in the fourth quarter when the ball 
was stripped from his hands at the eight-yard line. It seemed to put the 
Monarchs that much closer to elimination. They were down, 24-14, and fading 
fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Many would have folded, Bodnar remained firm. He scored on a two-yard run with 
3 minutes 44 seconds left. On the Monarchs' next possession, Bodnar carried the 
ball five consecutive times, gaining 31 yards, to set up the game-winning 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 And yes, he can't recall a thing from that game. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the way Steve is," Rollinson said. "He's uncomfortable with talking 
about what he does in games. To him, it's no big deal. He doesn't want to talk 
about it, he wants to get on to the next football game." 
</P>
<P>
 That drive has been with Bodnar since the day he played his first game. It was 
determination that got him on a team in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were going by the park and Steve saw these kids practicing football," 
Stella Bodnar said. "He wanted to play, so we stopped. I asked the coach about 
signing him up. He took Steve and a couple of his players aside and had them 
run to a tree. Steve beat them both and the coach signed him up right there, 
using a napkin." 
</P>
<P>
 Bodnar, the youngest of six children, was 6. He played running back on youth 
football teams through the eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, Steve Bodnar, was there to watch him, always. It became difficult 
to play when his father died of a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was too young to really understand," Bodnar said. 
</P>
<P>
 He funneled that confusion into other avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "He became a little rebellious," Stella Bodnar said. "Basically, Steve began 
rebelling against the fact his dad had died. It was a tough thing for him. He 
didn't want to go to Mater Dei, he wanted to go to Villa Park. I told him, 'It 
was either Mater Dei or military school.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out to be the best thing that could have happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Bodnar has come to terms with his father's death. Recently, he participated in 
a celebration mass for the dead at school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that was a big step for Steve," Rollinson said. "He has never spoken 
about his dad to me. He knows me well enough, that if he ever wanted to, he 
could. But I was very proud of him when he participated in the mass." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Stella Bodnar: "I think his father's death was one of the reasons he 
didn't play football as a freshman. I think he really wanted to see if he 
wanted to play. He got so anxious that year, I knew he would go back." 
</P>
<P>
 He walked on, virtually an unknown, and became the starting tailback on the 
sophomore team. 
</P>
<P>
 Bodnar was on the varsity as a junior, but found a backfield bursting at the 
seams. Sophomore Michael Graham and junior Jason Lundstrom also were tailbacks. 
Graham won the starting job and Bodnar was turned into a safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham was gone by the fourth game of the season; he transferred to Edison. It 
left a hole that Bodnar was more than happy to plug. 
</P>
<P>
 He ran for 212 yards against San Clemente in his first starting assignment. He 
scored on a 54-yard run in that game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had gone with the Graham kid because of breakaway speed," Rollinson said. 
"I didn't think Steve had the same ability." 
</P>
<P>
 Bodnar corrected that impression in the following weeks. He had an 86-yard 
touchdown run against Capistrano Valley and a 92-yard touchdown run against 
Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 But his biggest run was against Long Beach Poly in the Division I 
quarterfinals. The Monarchs trailed, 14-10, in the fourth quarter. Bodnar, 
playing on a sore ankle that had kept him out of the previous game, zig-zagged 
down the field, weaving through one of the top defensive teams in the section, 
for a 57-yard run to set up the go-ahead touchdown. The Monarchs won, 17-14. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was probably the finest run I have seen a high school back make," 
Rollinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Bodnar, of course, doesn't remember much about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just Steve," tackle Matt Motherway said. "Sometimes, we tease him. 
We'll ask him, 'Steve, who'd we play last week?' He just doesn't care about the 
past. It's already forgotten and he's on to the next game." 
</P>
<P>
 It's an attitude that Bodnar insists on having, one that he's pushed on to 
some teammates and they have adopted. There is no room for the meek in Bodnar's 
eyes. You have to remain focused. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the guys are a little timid," Bodnar said. "They're a little too 
nice. You can't be nice in life. Life isn't fair. You got to be strong and help 
yourself before you can help others." 
</P>
<P>
 Bodnar is working on that second part now. He would like to help the Monarchs 
win the title. 
</P>

 "I didn't spend three years of my life in high school football to come away 
with nothing," Bodnar said. "We've done great things and I've made great 
friends, but to win the ring is the ultimate achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to remember two games from high school. Last year's championship 
game and this year's championship game."

SOUTHERN SECTION FOOTBALL PLAYOFFS NCAA VOLLEYBALL REGIONALS; PLANNING MAKES 
PERFECT FOR ORANGE LUTHERAN; DIVISION X: RUNNING BACK HOLLOWAY SAYS TEAM 
ENVISIONED THIS MARCH TOWARD A SECTION TITLE BEFORE THE SEASON BEGAN.

<P>
 Eleven victories in 13 games. A first league championship, albeit a shared one 
with Cerritos Valley Christian. The top seeding in the Southern Section 
Division X playoffs. A berth in the championship game tonight against Van Nuys 
Montclair Prep. 
</P>
<P>
 Some would call Orange Lutheran's 1994 football season a dream come true. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Che Holloway begs to differ. 
</P>
<P>
 "Call it a goal season," said Holloway, a 16-year-old junior, who with 
quarterback Joe Juliano and receiver Michael Crawford is the nucleus of the 
Lancers' potent offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had planned this the whole time. We had worked hard the summer and fall, 
and didn't expect anything less, to be quite honest," Holloway said. "When 
we've been behind in games, it's like, 'We can't lose, we've worked too hard to 
lose.' That's the frame of mind." 
</P>
<P>
 But he also admits it has been "pretty amazing" to see the best football 
season in school history unfold in this fashion, because -- on the surface -- 
Orange Lutheran does not give the impression of being a dominant team. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at our players -- only one or two weighing over 200 pounds -- 
if you saw them walk down the street, there's no way you'd think we'd be in the 
Division X finals," Holloway said. "But we want to play football." 
</P>
<P>
 And play it they do. Orange Lutheran boasts an offensive playbook as thick as 
the Yellow Pages, and Holloway is one of its main features. The 5-11, 
175-pounder has rushed for 1,162 yards in 143 carries (an 8.1-yard average) in 
his first full season here. That already ranks him fifth on the Lancers' 
all-time career rushing list. 
</P>
<P>
 Holloway also has caught seven passes for 205 yards, and scored 19 touchdowns. 
Seventeen have come on the ground, a school single-season record. In the 
regular-season finale against Valley Christian, Holloway tied the school record 
for the longest touchdown reception -- a 91-yard catch on the game's first 
play. It set the tone for Orange Lutheran's 30-17 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 It's fitting that Holloway is carving his niche in Lancer history. His father, 
Will, impressed with the school's academic and social atmosphere, wanted his 
son to attend Orange Lutheran from the start. "He said if we lived back East, 
he'd put me in one of those prep schools," Holloway said. But Holloway was more 
interested in joining his friends at Tustin High, where he enrolled in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Once Holloway got there, however, "I found it was not what I thought it would 
be. So Dad said, 'Let's go to the school we originally planned on.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Holloway transferred in February 1994. When he got on the football field, the 
Lancer coaches saw they might have something special. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he might be good, but not this good," Coach Jim Kunau said. "But 
he's taken tremendous pressure off Joe and allowed him to have the great year 
at quarterback he's having." 
</P>
<P>
 To have such a season takes a group effort, Holloway said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to have some linemen who want to open holes for you," he said. 
"Not only have the guards, center and tackles done a great job blocking, so has 
fullback Matt Stratton. But, as a runner, you've got to not want to go down; 
spin out of tackles, cut back. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Holloway's trademark is speed. On the option pitch play or a short pass in the 
flat, he can buzz by startled defenders before they can react. But he's not 
afraid to run off-tackle or up the middle, even when giving away 50-70 pounds. 
Plus he's tougher than he looks; Holloway has missed only one game this season, 
when he sat out the Laguna Beach matchup because of back spasms. 
</P>
<P>
 He's also quite bright, carrying a 3.7 grade-point average. And intelligence 
plays an important role in the types of plays Orange Lutheran tends to run. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some kids may have to go over something several times," Kunau said. "Let Che 
see it once and he's got it." 
</P>
<P>
 Holloway modestly claims it's not that easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to learn all the motions and sets," he said. "It's not so much the 
plays; once you learn the numbers called, you know where the ball is going. 
Still, it took me a month or two to get comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Holloway nor his teammates expect Montclair Prep to make things 
comfortable for them tonight at Los Angeles Valley College. The Mounties may be 
an at-large team, but at 10-1, many think they are the best team in Division X. 
</P>
<P>
 But Orange Lutheran, which has spent the season playing bigger, stronger 
teams, will show up. And so will Holloway, who was held to 34 yards in the 
semifinals by San Pedro Mary Star of the Sea, and does not want his season to 
conclude in that fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Still . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Win or lose, it's a season I will not forget," Holloway said.

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL / DIVISION V FINAL; NEWPORT HARBOR RALLIES TO FIRST TITLE

 Newport Harbor's John Giordani threw a 38-yard touchdown pass to Mike Freeman 
with less than three minutes remaining to lift the Sailors to a 20-15 victory 
over Servite in the Southern Section Division V championship football game. 
</P>
<P>
 Servite had one last chance, but Tom Eaton sacked quarterback David Martin, 
knocking the ball loose, and Newport Harbor's Jack Hogan recovered at the 
Friars' 33 to seal the victory at Orange Coast College before an overflow crowd 
of 8,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The championship was the first for top-seeded Newport Harbor (14-0) during its 
64 years of varsity football. The Sailors lost to Bonita in the 1942 Lower 
Division final, 39-6, and lost to Irvine in the 1992 Division IV final, 30-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Giordani, who completed seven of 13 passes for 160 yards, tossed the 
game-winner with 2:37 remaining. The play ended a four-play, 77-yard drive that 
took only 1:26. 
</P>
<P>
 Giordani began the drive with a 20-yard completion to Danny Pulido, who had 
five catches for 79 yards. Two carries by Brian Johnson, who had 134 yards in 
19 carries, moved the ball to the 38 to set up the game-winning play. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-seeded Servite (11-3) took the lead briefly with 4:08 remaining when 
David Bedard, who rushed for 120 yards in 25 carries, scored on a one-yard run 
to give Servite a 15-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friars rushed for 244 yards but Newport Harbor limited Servite to 11 yards 
passing.

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL / DIVISION IV FINAL; CANYON SPRINGS ROLLS OVER NORCO, 48-0 
</P>

<P>
 Moreno Valley Canyon Springs High scored four first-half touchdowns en route 
to a 48-0 victory over Norco Friday night in the Southern Section Division IV 
football championship game before an estimated 4,000 at Mt. San Antonio 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior quarterback Ryan Roques completed five of seven passes for 113 yards, 
including a 53-yard scoring play to Charles Watkins on the final play of the 
first half, giving Canyon Springs (13-1) a 28-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Roques also rushed for 63 yards and a five-yard touchdown, as Canyon Springs, 
ranked No. 6 by The Times, made amends after losing to Irvine, 41-14, in last 
year's Division IV final. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids came ready to play tonight," Canyon Springs Coach Jack Fogarty said. 
"We played bad in last year's finals, and all the kids cared about tonight was 
winning that title." 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon Springs, which had five players run for touchdowns, outgained Norco, 
392 yards to 92. Norco finished 11-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Norco quarterback Andrew Whieldon completed only two of 15 passes for 50 
yards. He was sacked seven times. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stopped their running game and forced them to pass," Fogarty said. "We 
knew if that happened, we'd get to the quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
 Terrelle Smith, who rushed for 61 yards and two touchdowns, finished off an 
80-yard drive with a seven-yard run, giving Canyon Springs a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Roques made it 14-0 in the first quarter when he scored from five yards out. 
</P>
<P>
 Darrell Franklin gave Canyon Springs a 21-0 lead with a one-yard run in the 
second quarter.

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL FINALS; BIRMINGHAM POWELL-LESS TO STOP BELL; CITY 3-A 
DIVISION: NECK INJURY SIDELINES FOUR-YEAR STARTER AND BRAVES FALL, 25-3, IN 
EPSTEIN'S LAST GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 David Belk tried to keep Birmingham High's dream postseason alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Belk had three interceptions in the second half as the Braves attempted to 
overcome a 15-point halftime deficit, but their offense sputtered and Bell 
claimed the City Section 3-A Division football title with a 25-3 victory Friday 
night at Gardena High. 
</P>
<P>
 The title is the first in football for Bell (11-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Birmingham (7-6-1), which had won three games after entering the playoffs 
seeded last, hoped to win a championship for retiring Coach Alan (Chick) 
Epstein. But playing without four-year starter Marvin Powell, a linebacker and 
fullback, the Braves were held to 153 yards of offense and could not contain 
Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell sprained his neck in last week's semifinal victory over Wilson but was 
advised by doctors to not play in the final. 
</P>
<P>
 "They seemed to know where I was going every time I ran," tailback Courtney 
Blunt said. Blunt rushed for 116 yards in 20 carries to give him 1,644 yards 
for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Belk's interceptions came deep in Bell territory during the third 
quarter, but a furious pass-rush by linebacker Isodro Vargas and lineman Alain 
Toca sacked quarterback Paul Prince four times on the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to force them to pass," Bell Coach Henry Santiago said. "We knew 
they could run." 
</P>
<P>
 Prince completed four of 10 passes for 53 yards with two interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the completions appeared to be for a 40-yard touchdown to Jason Howard 
midway through the fourth quarter, but Howard fumbled just before he reached 
the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be the closest the Braves came to the end zone. "It's been so 
emotionally tough," Epstein said. "We thought Marvin had a broken neck last 
week and when we got down we just couldn't make a big play." 
</P>
<P>
 A 70-yard run by junior tailback Vern Benard late in the third quarter 
provided the only score of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Eagles' previous possession, Benard had a 64-yard score called back on 
a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just ran the exact same play and it worked again perfectly," said Benard, 
who rushed for 179 yards in 17 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell quarterback Gustavo Valenzuela completed eight of 19 passes for 167 yards 
with four interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves' longest play from scrimmage in the first half was its first, a 
direct snap to Howard, the wingback. Howard gained 18 yards on the play. 
</P>
<P>
 Birmingham's biggest play of the half was a 50-yard punt return by Roderick 
Courtney to the Bell 27-yard line. The return set up a 37-yard field goal by 
Luis Salguero halfway through the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 After tying the score with a field goal, Bell drove 69 yards in six plays to 
take a 10-3 lead midway through the second quarter. A 47-yard run by Benard set 
up a one-yard sneak by Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
 Just before halftime, the Eagles drove 65 yards in seven plays. Dicky Percell 
made two spectacular receptions, the second good for a 12-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 A two-point conversion reception by Freddy Alcala gave Bell an 18-3 halftime 
lead.

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL / DIVISION III FINAL; STUBBORN NOTRE DAME DEFEATS AYALA

<P>
 Ryan Bowne couldn't stop the tears and Robbie Brewster couldn't stop signing 
autographs. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Coach Kevin Rooney got carried away -- on his players' shoulders -- after 
Notre Dame High won the Southern Section Division III football championship 
with a 27-20 victory over Ayala (12-2) on Friday night before about 5,000 at 
Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
 For Notre Dame (13-1), which came from behind twice to win, the title is the 
first in the school's 47-year history, an accomplishment not lost on coaches or 
players, who went wild with jubilation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't believe this," Brewster, a senior wide receiver, said, 
scribbling his name on the caps of several young boys. "This is unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 Brewster hauled in two touchdown passes from Bowne, including the game-winner 
from 32 yards with 3:05 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights trailed, 6-0 and 13-10, and looked as if they might be run off the 
field early in the game by the Bulldogs' ball-control offense that engineered a 
10-minute touchdown drive to open the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bowne, playing his best game of the season, completed 15 of 25 passes for 
221 yards to keep the Knights' alive. He connected with Brewster for a 27-yard 
touchdown in the second quarter to give Notre Dame a 7-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, the junior quarterback was overcome with tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how to (express) how I feel," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is usually the case with Rooney, the Knights' stoic coach who was handed 
a cigar after the final gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to go smoke this," he said, jokingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Rooney, in his 15th season at Notre Dame, said the victory was typical of his 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to remember this team as a bunch of guys who were always fighting 
back," Rooney said. 
</P>
<P>
 The game almost came down to a memorable climax as Bowne drove the Knights 78 
yards in the final five minutes. Notre Dame kicker Chris Sailer, who booted 
field goals of 24 and 57 yards, was warming up on the sideline in anticipation 
of settling it with his powerful right leg. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brewster, who finished with four catches for 97 yards, caught Bowne's pass 
over the middle and broke a pair of tackles at the 10-yard line to reach the 
end zone.

 Even Coach Kevin Rooney got carried away -- on his players' shoulders -- after

 Ayala (12-2) chewed up 10 minutes 27 seconds with a 95-yard, first-half drive 
that culminated with fullback Rocky O'Brien's three-yard touchdown burst. 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Collins' extra-point attempt failed and Ayala led, 6-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowne then drove Notre Dame 61 yards in seven plays to give Notre Dame a 7-6

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL FINALS; ANOTHER RING FOR SYLMAR'S PRICE CLUB?; CITY 4-A 
DIVISION: SPARTAN RUNNING BACK CAN MATCH BROTHER'S TITLE TODAY AGAINST 
CRENSHAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When Durell Price steps onto the field today for the City Section Division 4-A 
championship game, he will be armored with more than just the required 
protective gear and a Sylmar High football uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-1, 215-pound junior running back will be equipped with two sources 
of inspiration, one on each of the powerful legs that have rushed for 1,770 
yards and guided Sylmar's 13-0 season. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby rattle secured to the inside thigh-pad pocket will remind him that 
his 4-month old son Durell Jr. needs a father he can grow to respect and 
admire. Taped to his other thigh, Price will feel his brother Deon's 1992 City 
championship ring and remember his dream to earn one just like it, engraved 
with the same initials, DP. 
</P>
<P>
 Today at noon, Price will get his chance to equal his brother's feat when 
top-seeded Sylmar faces Crenshaw (12-1) in the City championship game at El 
Camino College in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Price, 16, has been dreaming of a City title since he and his family moved 
from Lancaster to Sylmar nearly four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning, Price was upset that his mother moved the family in order to 
have a shorter commute to her job in Pacoima. But it wasn't long before Price 
was sold on being a Spartan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Price family moved into a house about a stone's throw from the Sylmar 
football field. One day shortly after the move in the summer of 1991, a junior 
high student approached Sylmar Coach Jeff Engilman during a workout. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he walked up to me, I thought he (had just enrolled)," Engilman said. "I 
asked him, 'So are we ready?' and he said, 'Well, I'm only an eighth grader,' 
and I was going, 'Wow-wee.' 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew right then that he was gonna be something special." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Engilman couldn't get Price in a Spartan uniform just yet, he did put 
him on the sideline as a ballboy for the 1991 and '92 seasons. And in the 
meantime, Engilman managed to get Deon off the basketball court and onto the 
football field for his senior year in '92. 
</P>
<P>
 While Durell was happy to just be around Sylmar football, he couldn't shake 
the yearning to be something more for the Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
 As an eighth- and ninth-grader at Olive Vista Junior High, Price would bolt 
out of school at 2:55 p.m. when the final bell rang, then run two blocks down 
Borden Avenue and into the Sylmar weight room before Sylmar's final bell rang 
at 3:05. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to do everything with the team, like a Rudy almost," Price said. "I 
wanted to be on Sylmar's team so bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Price watched as his brother Deon helped lead the Spartans past 
Carson, 17-0, in the championship game. Deon was the quarterback in a 
run-oriented offense that revolved around running back Tyrone Crenshaw, who now 
plays at Michigan State. 
</P>
<P>
 Deon, who has played quarterback at Bakersfield College the past two seasons, 
has always been much more than a brother, Durell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Price, Deon and Durell's father, has been in and out of the picture 
since their parents' divorce more than seven years ago. Deon, Durell said, has 
been everything he needed him to be -- and much more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always tried to follow him around: Do what he did, say what he said, be 
like he is," Price said. "To this very day I still look up to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Durell draws much of his inspiration from his family: Deon, sister Deshawnia, 
who is also the team statistician, and mother Debbie. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I think about how tired I am, or if Coach takes me out of the game 
because I'm tired, I just dig down deep and think about my family," Price said. 
"I've got to do this for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 But while his family commitments are strong, Durell idolizes no one more than 
his brother. Deon and Durell talked by phone before every game this season, one 
telling the other his goals for the week. Durell made most of Deon's games this 
season, often leaving for Bakersfield less than an hour after his game ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Deon has made as many Sylmar games as possible. Last week, Deon 
encouraged his brother from the Sylmar sideline, cheering each of Durell's four 
touchdown runs against Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 About 15 hours later, Deon was leading the Renegades to a 31-9 victory over 
Long Beach City in the 43rd Shrine Potato Bowl. And Durell was there to witness 
his big brother's scoring pass and five-yard touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
 With a powerful arm and a 6-4 frame, Deon has been attracting attention since 
he put on a Spartan uniform. But Deon lacked the core requirements to earn a 
scholarship to a Division I school and had to settle for junior college 
football. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would have been a Division I ballplayer," Engilman said. "We had at least 
eight or nine schools that were just drooling over him." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Deon doesn't want his brother following in his footsteps 
academically. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm constantly telling him if you don't have to go to (junior college), then 
don't," said Deon, who is being recruited by Pacific, among others. "He's got 
the chance to go almost anywhere he wants to. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was looking at his report card the other day and there were a lot of A's 
and B's. I was really shocked." 
</P>
<P>
 At his brother's insistence, Durell has maintained his academic eligibility 
and said he will complete all of his college-requirement courses next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 And when it comes time to take the Scholastic Aptitude Test, Deon has 
volunteered to pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sad that my brother had to go through it . . . that he had to be an 
example for me," Durell said. "But I'm glad he stuck with it and toughed out 
those two years of junior college to go to Division I." 
</P>
<P>
 While Price has turned heads of college recruiters since his sophomore year, 
blue-chip running backs are nothing new at Sylmar. Engilman has produced a 
1,000-yard rusher each season since he took over in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 It started with Jerome Casey, who rushed for 1,179 yards and seven touchdowns 
in Engilman's first season. Each season, the primary running back's offensive 
numbers have improved. After Casey came Tobaise Brookins, who plays for 
Washington, and Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 So in this line of explosive backs, where does Price rate? 
</P>
<P>
 "As a pure power back, he's probably the best power back I've ever had," 
Engilman said. "Cutting ability, he rates behind Crenshaw, Brookins and Jerome. 
I believe those three were more explosive to the line, yet I don't think that 
Durell has ever been caught from behind." 
</P>
<P>
 Price illustrated Engilman's belief last week in Sylmar's 27-19 victory over 
Carson. He took a handoff, went right, turned the corner and blazed down the 
Carson sideline 48 yards for his fourth touchdown of the game. Price ran away 
from Carson defensive back Joseph Redmond, the Colts' featured speedster. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Price) is a legit 4.4 (in the 40)," Engilman said. "(But) I think if you had 
someone chasing him while you were timing him, it might be a different story." 
</P>
<P>
 To improve his speed, Price routinely runs his wind sprints with a partner who 
starts five or six yards ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he can improve his quickness, I think he is going to be the best running 
back in the state next year," Engilman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's certain things you can't teach ballplayers. He's very instinctive." 
</P>
<P>
 College recruiters took notice of Price last season when he played fullback in 
front of Crenshaw, who rushed for 1,785 yards and earned 4-A player of the year 
honors. Price rushed for 540 yards and eight touchdowns in 50 carries. In two 
seasons, Price is averaging 10.7 yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Price's glory is polarized by his offensive statistics, his 
defensive prowess is usually overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Price, who also starts at middle linebacker, routinely comes up with a big 
defensive play. And he shows more emotion after a big hit or tackle or even a 
block than he does after a long touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather throw that game-winning block than score that game-winning 
touchdown," Price said. "It seems to me if you do something for your teammates, 
it will work out for you in the long run." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Engilman: "He's a natural leader and just a good kid to be around." 
</P>
<P>
 Price is hoping that someday the same will be said of his namesake, Durell Jr. 
And in the meantime, he is certain to keep his son in mind -- on and off the 
field. The rattle is a constant reminder. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my good-luck charm," Price said. "I'm gonna keep it next year and in 
college. I'm gonna keep that rattle all the way through."

CANCHOLA DISRUPTS PECKING ORDER; CROSS-COUNTRY: DRAMATIC IMPROVEMENT OF 
NORDHOFF FRESHMAN HAS STUNNED EXPERTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jack Farrell, the long-time cross-country coach at Thousand Oaks High, made 
the remarks during the awards ceremony at last Saturday's Foot Locker West 
regional in Fresno, but he could have been summing up the thoughts of anyone 
involved in high school distance running. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a girl who's gone from running 21 minutes (for three-miles) two months 
ago to (17:33) today," Farrell said of Nordhoff freshman Elaine Canchola as she 
accepted her medal for finishing second. "It's absolutely amazing. I've never 
seen anything like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither has Nordhoff Coach Ken Reeves, who has been training high school 
distance runners for the past two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither has Doug Speck, an editor for Track & Field News and one of the 
nation's foremost high school cross-country authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Canchola, who will run in the Foot Locker national championships at San 
Diego's Morley Field today, has made a meteoric rise through the high school 
distance-running ranks since placing fifth in the Blue Lagoon Invitational at 
UC Santa Barbara on Sept. 24 with a time of 20 minutes 46 seconds for three 
miles. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is an amazing commodity," Speck said. "Most of the kids who qualify for 
the national championships have a fairly extensive background in youth 
competition, but not her. She has less experience than anyone I can ever 
remember running in this meet." 
</P>
<P>
 Canchola, who is in her first cross-country season, didn't start running track 
until last year, when she timed 5:39 in the mile. 
</P>
<P>
 Although that was a fine mark for someone her age, Reeves would have been 
happy if she'd dipped under 19 minutes by the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way in the world that I would have envisioned that she would have 
run this fast," he said. "After the Ventura County meet, I jokingly said, 'I 
think she'll run 17:48.' I kept saying that, but I had no basis at all to do 
so." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County championships, which were held at Lake Casitas in Ojai on 
Oct. 28, is where the 5-foot, 90-pound Canchola first gained attention. 
</P>
<P>
 She had run a promising 19:00 to finish 13th in the Division III sweepstakes 
race of the Mt. San Antonio College Invitational the previous week. But when 
she raced to a 20-meter lead over Amy Skieresz of Agoura -- the defending State 
Division I champion -- after the first half-mile of the county meet, more than 
one spectator asked, "Who the heck is that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves joked that Canchola was the secret weapon he'd been waiting to unleash, 
but he too was surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little apprehensive when she blasted out and took the lead," he said. 
"But when I saw her at the mile mark, she looked under control so I didn't 
worry." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Canchola (18:32) eventually finished third behind Skieresz (17:48) 
and Thousand Oaks' Kim Mortensen (18:23), it was the last time she would take a 
back seat to that talented duo. 
</P>
<P>
 Canchola ran 18:27 at Lake Casitas to win the Frontier League title Nov. 3, 
and then came the stunner, a 17:53 clocking at Mt. SAC to win her heat of the 
Southern Section Division III prelims Nov. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen a lot of things since I've been coaching and been surprised a lot 
of times," Reeves said. "But that was the first time I was truly shocked." 
</P>
<P>
 Canchola proved the race wasn't a fluke by running a freshman course record of 
17:35 to win the Division III title at Mt. SAC the following week. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Buena Park freshman Heather Garritson, the runner-up in the section 
finals, defeated Canchola in the State Division III final at Fresno's Woodward 
Park two weeks ago, Canchola wasn't disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just learned some things at state," Canchola said. "My goal (at the West 
regional) was to try and beat her. I was pretty sure I could do that." 
</P>
<P>
 She not only beat Garritson, who finished seventh, she also topped Skieresz 
(fifth) and Mortensen (10th) in cutting 34 seconds from her time at the State 
meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, she'll shoot for a top-10 finish in a meet she hadn't heard of until a 
few weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "(This season) has been a very, very big surprise, but I'm really thankful 
that it happened," Canchola said. "My only goal at the start of the season was 
to try and get a lower time each week and I've pretty much done that." 
</P>
<P>
 Canchola's rise to stardom has people asking about her athletic background, 
but it is nothing extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Ventura and raised in Ojai, she is the third of six children. 
Canchola's parents are natives of Guadalajara, Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither were competitive athletes, but Canchola says that her father and both 
her grandfathers were known for being fleet of foot as youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess some of that has been passed onto me," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the above, combined with a low-mileage training regimen that averages 
less than 25 miles a week, has people wondering how much faster Canchola can 
run this season or during track season in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Speck figures she could run "10:45 for two miles right now," but he sees no 
reason to try to set limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's neat to see things like this happen because when you've been around this 
sport for a while, you have a tendency to establish a pecking order in how 
runners should stack up against each other," he said. "But not with her. She 
has just blown those lists away."

FELDMAN'S AGGRESSIVENESS SERVES HER WELL IN CITY FINAL; GIRLS' TENNIS: TAFT 
SENIOR FINISHES CAREER 48-2 AFTER WINNING SINGLES TITLE IN STRAIGHT SETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles is the second-largest city in the United States, and today Julia 
Feldman owns it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Taft High senior knocked off defending champion Kendra Segura of Dorsey, 
6-4, 6-0, to capture the City Section girls' singles championship Friday at the 
Racquet Centre. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman finished with a three-year record of 48-2, the losses coming to former 
teammate Brahna Pastorini in the 1992 final and Segura in the 1993 semifinals. 
The only challenge left for Feldman was to win the crown. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels very good," Feldman said. "I wanted it really bad. I've been wanting 
to win this for the last three years. I have a lot of aspirations in tennis, 
and this is one step toward what I want to accomplish." 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman lost in straight sets to Segura, a sophomore, last year but spent the 
past year changing her style. She has practiced three to four hours a day under 
Coach Desi McBride at the Calabasas Park Tennis Club and has become a powerful 
serve-and-volley player. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman broke Segura's service three times in each set and was the aggressor 
throughout. But she also double-faulted five times and was broken by Segura 
twice in the opening set. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman then began hitting for winners on serve to take the first game of the 
second set. She broke Segura with a screaming backhand crossing shot to lead, 
2-0, and had three more winners and an ace to win the third game. 
</P>
<P>
 Segura, a smooth, quiet counterpuncher who defeated Pastorini last year after 
dropping the first set, was still a dangerous opponent. But she relented while 
serving at love-three. 
</P>
<P>
 With the fourth game at deuce, Feldman hit a forehand return winner, then 
Segura hit a backhand long to make it 4-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman finished Segura with three service winners and a winning forehand to 
lead, 5-0. On set point, Segura double-faulted. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the first set I got more confident," Feldman said. "I don't know if she 
got frustrated, but I decided to go for it. I didn't want to let her get back 
in." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Feldman overpowered Segura with 24 winners, 12 in each set, three aces 
and nine service winners. 
</P>
<P>
 Segura gave Feldman a scare in the first set, breaking her opening service to 
lead, 1-0, and pushing Feldman to deuce three times. 
</P>
<P>
 Down 5-2, Segura held serve then broke Feldman to make it 5-4. Serving and 
trying to tie at 5-5, Segura let Feldman break back and win the set when her 
attempt at a backhand winner was an inch wide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made so many unforced errors," said Segura, who was coming off a six-month 
layoff because of a back problem. "My feet weren't moving and my mechanics 
weren't with me."

BASEBALL PLAYERS' PROPOSAL NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE MUCH IMPACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The proposal that the baseball players' union will present to the owners today 
seems more likely to produce a crash course in labor law than a bargaining 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacking the rigid cost controls that the owners demand and designed more to 
challenge the apparent lip service the owners have given to the concept of a 
partnership with the players, it seems unlikely the proposal can forestall the 
owners' plan to declare an impasse and unilaterally implement their salary-cap 
proposal on Thursday in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely crunch time, and that might be helpful to get both sides 
moving -- at least hopefully," said Dick Conn, an associate of special mediator 
William J. Usery. 
</P>
<P>
 Usery got the owners to delay implementation on Dec. 5 to give the union time 
to develop the proposal it delivered to the mediator Friday night, but he lacks 
binding authority and, despite his recent plea that implementation would be 
damaging to the bargaining and mediating process, only a show of progress in 
this final attempt to reach a negotiated settlement will keep the owners from 
convening in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there any flexibility in the implementation timetable? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not much, if any," Stan Kasten, president of the Atlanta Braves and a member 
of the owners' negotiating team, said Friday. "But show me a reason and then 
I'll be able to answer that." 
</P>
<P>
 The union hopes to provide that reason today, when its proposal reaches the 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen three different reports," Kasten said, referring to the contents of 
the proposal. "One made me absolutely furious, one made me absolutely ebullient 
and one left me totally confused, which is probably the most accurate." 
</P>
<P>
 The union proposal, sources have said, has no cap or ceiling. It imposes a 
"tax" of about 5.3% on the highest-revenue teams, creating a pool of $60 
million to $70 million for the lower-revenue teams. That total is comparable to 
the revenue stream in the owners' salary-cap proposal, but the 5.3% rate may 
not provide the spending discouragement that the owners' high-rate tax proposal 
does. 
</P>
<P>
 The union proposal also creates a $25-million to $35-million pool from 
licensing revenue that the owners would match from expansion fees, the money to 
be used in joint marketing and capital ventures. It also calls for the players 
to share in major industry decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Said union leader Donald Fehr: "The owners have talked about expanding the 
game together, about forming new partnerships, but we've never heard anything 
more from them on those subjects except general concepts. This proposal 
requires commitments from the clubs and players to work together in the 
long-term interest of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Is that enough? 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to have a partnership," Kasten said. "At the same time, our goals 
haven't changed because the economic problems haven't changed. Salary control 
is very important." 
</P>
<P>
 Said acting Commissioner Bud Selig from Milwaukee: "We need to forge a 
partnership, no question about it. We need to move beyond the acrimony so that 
we can grow revenue to the benefit of everyone, but we can't do it until we 
solve our economic problems in a meaningful way, which is why we need an entire 
new system that will allow that growth. The NBA and NFL cleared a lot of that 
up (by going to salary caps)." 
</P>
<P>
 The message seems clear: Cost control comes first. If the owners don't get it 
here, they will implement the cap Thursday in Chicago, reacting to a Dec. 20 
deadline for tendering 1995 contracts. Selig reiterated that the clubs have 
reached a point "where they have to know what system is in place so that they 
can set their rosters." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the chairman of his negotiating committee, Chief Executive 
Officer John Harrington of the Boston Red Sox, said he is hopeful there will be 
reason to delay implementation again, that Dec. 20 is not etched in stone. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all part of what is being called a doomsday scenario in which the union 
would react to implementation with a series of legal challenges through the 
National Labor Relations Board and federal court in Philadelphia, where the 
owners' antitrust exemption has been significantly narrowed by a previous 
ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 The union would then resume the strike next spring when the owners plan to 
open the camps with replacement players. 
</P>
<P>
 In time, cost control could come at a heavy price, with the owners fined 
considerably more than their $280-million collusion assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I make the assumption that if the owners are interested in trying to find a 
deal, these talks will continue until we make one," Fehr said. "If they're not, 
we'll cross that bridge when we come to it."

CSUN WINS SECOND GAME IN A ROW; BASKETBALL: MARTIN COMES OFF THE BENCH TO KEY 
73-68 VICTORY OVER SAN DIEGO STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Could practice be overrated? 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Martin, a senior guard on the Cal State Northridge basketball team, spent 
most of fall workouts either watching from the sideline or in the training 
room, rehabilitating an injured back. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Northridge's opener, he had taken part in five practices. So guess who 
has scored in double-figures -- as a reserve, no less -- in four of 
Northridge's five games? 
</P>
<P>
 Martin scored 11 points in 20 minutes, including two key free throws with six 
seconds left, to help Northridge down San Diego State, 73-68, in a 
nonconference game played before 676 fans Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's playing a good role for us," Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy said. "He 
comes off the bench and ignites us." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin's work on the perimeter was complemented by some strong inside work by 
Peter Micelli. The Matadors' 6-foot-8 center scored a team-high 17 points as 
Northridge won its second in a row after opening with three consecutive losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guys like Ryan come in and hit a few (three-point shots) and it opens up the 
world for me," Micelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Robert Hill added 13 points for Northridge, including nine in the first 
half -- all on three-point baskets. Forward Ruben Oronoz matched Martin's 11 
points off the bench, also in 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge shot a season-high 50% yet still was hanging on at the end because 
of a couple of ill-timed fouls. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors led, 69-65, with 21 seconds left when Micelli ran over Chad 
Nelson after the San Diego State guard had launched a three-point attempt. The 
shot didn't fall, but Nelson did, prompting a three-shot foul. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for Northridge, he made only one. Unfortunately for Northridge, 
Berry Randle rebounded Nelson's last miss, allowing Chris Davis to put in a 
short bank shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Randle was fouled by Hill on the play, giving the Aztecs a chance to tie the 
score at 69 with 14 seconds left. He missed. 
</P>
<P>
 After a mad scramble, San Diego State again had the ball and new life, but 
Brady Trenkle, the son of Aztec Coach Fred Trenkle, was called for traveling 
with seven seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin's free throws -- and two more by Hill with one second to play -- gave 
Northridge its final margin. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors made only 18 of 30 free-throw attempts, but San Diego State was 
even worse, making 11 of 24. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have rebuilt Northridge with the bricks we threw up there," Fred 
Trenkle said of his club's free-throw shooting.

ARCE TO MAKE DASH FOR NATIONAL SPLASH; CROSS-COUNTRY: PALMDALE SENIOR PEAKING 
PERFECTLY FOR FOOT LOCKER CHAMPIONSHIPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Few high school distance runners peaked better than Antonio Arce of Palmdale 
during last spring's track season, and he appears to be doing so again entering 
today's Foot Locker national cross-country championships at Morley Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Arce, a senior, has been among the top runners in the state all season, but he 
has looked razor sharp the last three weeks, winning Division II titles in the 
Southern Section and State championships in November and finishing third in the 
West regional last Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 He's gunning for another top-three finish in today's meet, which pits the top 
eight finishers from each of four regions across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "The top three is a good goal for me if I run how I'm capable of," Arce said. 
"I'm really focused on this weekend. Last week was just to qualify. This week 
is to go for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Arce finished behind Jason Balkman of Lynbrook High in San Jose and Brandon 
Leslie of Gallup, N.M., in the West regional, but he figures that Brad Hauser 
of Kingwood, Tex., and Matt Downin of Pinkerton Academy in Hampstead, N.H., are 
the runners to beat. 
</P>
<P>
 Hauser, who finished fourth in last year's championships, won the South 
regional two weeks ago. Downin, who placed eighth last year, won Northeast 
regional. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie is the No. 2-returning runner, having placed sixth last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Balkman, the State Division I champion, was expected to be a contender, but he 
he will not run after choosing to attend a school dance Friday. Foot Locker 
rules stipulate that individuals who compete in the meet must attend all the 
pre-race functions that began Thursday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard talk about that dance after the West regional and I thought he must 
be joking," Arce said. "But I guess he wasn't. I sure wouldn't miss (this meet) 
for anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Arce, who cut his best in the 3,200 meters from 9 minutes 25.68 seconds to 
9:03.19 in the last three weeks of his junior track season, heads a strong 
contingent of local entries in the boys' race, which starts at 10:40 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The others are Camarillo's Eleazar Hernandez, who finished fourth in the West 
regional, and Hart's Brett Strahan, who placed fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez was the hottest runner in the state for much of the season, winning 
the team sweepstakes race of the Mt. San Antonio College Invitational in 
October and the Southern Section Division I championships last month, but he 
hasn't looked as sharp lately. 
</P>
<P>
 He placed second in the State Division I final and had to come from 11th to 
fourth in the final mile of the West regional. 
</P>
<P>
 A sinus infection limited Strahan to sixth in the Southern Section Division I 
final and to 11th in the State meet, but he ran the final mile of the West 
regional as fast as anyone, moving from 17th to fifth in the final third of the 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 Nordhoff freshman Elaine Canchola, who finished second in the West regional, 
and Agoura senior Amy Skieresz, who placed fifth, are the local entries in the 
girls' race, which starts at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Both appear capable of top-10 finishes, but no runner is expected to beat 
Santa Rosa sophomore Julia Stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 Stamps is undefeated this season and has run a slew of course records, 
including a 16:58 clocking in the Mt. SAC Invitational and a 16:45 time in the 
West regional at Woodward Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Erin Davis of Saratoga Springs, N.Y., won last year's title as a freshman, but 
she only finished fourth in this year's Northeast regional. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure (Davis) is not just going to hand it to Stamps," meet announcer Doug 
Speck said. "She's going to make her work for it, at least during the first 
part of the race. But I don't see anyone beating Stamps." 
</P>
<P>
 Skieresz finished third in the 1992 national championships as a sophomore, but 
much has happened since. 
</P>
<P>
 A case of mononucleosis ended her 1993 track season, she did not run in the 
West regional last year after being hampered by illness early in the season, 
and her father forbade her from running track last spring when her grades did 
not meet his standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The missed track season has left her feeling less than 100% at times this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing physically wrong," she said. "It's just that I didn't run 
last season and my body is still not in the greatest shape."

TRACKS MAKE AN OFFER JOCKEYS MIGHT ACCEPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A possible agreement in the insurance negotiations between jockeys and the 
nation's racetracks developed Friday after the tracks presented what they 
called "our best and final offer." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking from Tucson, John Giovanni, national manager of the Jockeys' Guild, 
said, "This could work. . . . I'll take it back to my executive board, and 
we'll crunch some numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 The tracks have given the guild until next Friday to respond to their offer, 
which includes a $100,000 ceiling for medical and surgical coverage, up from 
$50,000; $200 in weekly disability payments, up from $100, and $25,000 for 
accidental death or dismemberment, up from $5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The tracks also said they would continue to pay $1.7 million toward premiums. 
To make up the premium deficit, which was almost $800,000 in 1993, the jockeys 
have suggested that each track run one extra race a year as a fund-raiser, and 
on Friday the tracks said they would give that idea "fair consideration." BILL

THOROUGHBRED RACING; MANDELLA HOPES DARE AND GO WILL WIN HIM SECOND TURF CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The other day, in the context that Best Pal will be a 7-year-old in 1995, 
trainer Richard Mandella reflected on the success he has had with older horses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say anything bad about 7-year-olds," Mandella said. "We just retired 
Memo at seven. Leger Cat made more than $300,000 for us when he was 7. 
Exclusive Partner was winning stakes at 7. And remember Paisano Pete? He won 
seven out of 10 starts for me when he was a 7-year-old." 
</P>
<P>
 Second to Bobby Frankel in last year's national purse standings and sixth on 
the trainers' list this year, however, Mandella does not live by 7-year-olds 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 His Phone Chatter was the champion 2-year-old filly last year, his Kotashaan, 
a mere 5, was horse of the year, and on Sunday, Mandella will try to win the 
Hollywood Turf Cup for the second time with a 3-year-old when Dare And Go races 
10 rivals in the $500,000 stake. 
</P>
<P>
 Dare And Go will not sneak up on the Turf Cup the way The Hague, Mandella's 
first winner of the race, did in 1982. The Hague won a division of the Turf Cup 
at 23-1, his only stakes victory in a 29-race career. 
</P>
<P>
 Dare And Go, who runs in the colors of Frenchmen Jacques and Gerard 
Wertheimer, the brothers who raced Kotashaan, was 5-1 in the Hollywood Derby 
three weeks ago, and ran a strong second to River Flyer, even though Mandella's 
colt broke late and was unable to get position in a roughly run race. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a demolition derby," said Gary Stevens, who will be aboard Dare 
And Go again Sunday. "He got pinched back, and his running style had to change 
and he adapted to it pretty well. I was hopelessly beaten by the winner at the 
five-sixteenths pole. It was a hell of a run (considering) the circumstance." 
</P>
<P>
 River Flyer, who beat Dare And Go by 1 3/4 lengths for his first stakes win, 
is also running in the Turf Cup, but won't be able to control the pace as he 
and Chris Antley did in the Hollywood Derby. There's also the question of River 
Flyer being able to stay the 1 1/2 miles, a distance he has never run. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackdidi, a French-raced horse who left a 48-hour quarantine Friday after 
arriving in California in mid-week, drew the rail and will be ridden by Eddie 
Delahoussaye. The rest of the lineup, in order: Southern Wish, with Alex Solis 
aboard; Square Cut, Pat Valenzuela; Truly A Dream, David Flores; Dare And Go, 
Stevens; Savinio, Chris McCarron; Regency, Kent Desormeaux; Frenchpark, Corey 
Black; Lindon Lime, Shane Sellers; River Flyer, Antley; and Mashaallah, Laffit 
Pincay. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the horses will carry 126 pounds except Dare And Go and River Flyer, 
who will run with 122, and Truly A Dream, who will carry 119 as she tries to 
become the second filly to win the race. 
</P>
<P>
 The same day River Flyer won the Hollywood Derby, Southern Wish continued his 
startling rise from the claiming ranks with a three-length victory at 1 1/4 
miles in the Citation Handicap. Under Sunday's weight-for-age conditions, 
Southern Wish gains 11 pounds off that win and will be ridden by a different 
jockey, with Solis taking over for Corey Nakatani, who is busy in Hong Kong 
this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarron, who rode Savinio to his first stakes win, in the Burke Handicap at 
Santa Anita on Nov. 7, is always the jockey to watch in the Turf Cup. He has 
won the race six times in 12 tries and has been aboard the winners -- Miss 
Alleged, Bien Bien and Fraise -- the last three years. 
</P>
<P>
 No other jockey has won the stake more than once, and the race has been a 
bugaboo for some of the best. Pincay and Stevens, for example, are a combined 0 
for 19, never having finished better than third. Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Itsallgreektome, who won both races in 1990, is the only horse to have swept 
the Hollywood Derby and the Turf Cup. He was trained by Wally Dollase, who is 
the conditioner for Southern Wish. . . . After Sunday, Richard Mandella is 
expected to try Dare And Go on dirt. The colt is a son of Alydar and a grandson 
of Secretariat. 
</P>
<P>
 Square Cut, a 5-year-old gelding with early speed, has been second to Savinio 
and Southern Wish in his last two starts. . . . Bobby Frankel, who trains 
Regency and Mashaallah, is winless with 13 Turf Cup starters. 
</P>
<P>
 Megan's Interco, who will be ridden by Corey Nakatani, is 12-1 in a 14-horse 
field in the $800,000 Hong Kong International Bowl. There will be betting at 
Hollywood Park on that race and seven others from Hong Kong, starting at 9 p.m.

GIRLS' BASKETBALL / WOODBRIDGE TOURNAMENT; PEARSON, STOVALL LEAD WOODBRIDGE TO 
ROUT OF FOUNTAIN VALLEY IN CHAMPIONSHIP GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a night when it looked as if Woodbridge didn't want to win, Melanie Pearson 
and Erin Stovall showed they didn't want to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by two scoring spurts by the standouts, Woodbridge won the championship 
game of the Woodbridge Tipoff Classic Friday, scoring a 61-37 victory over 
Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge, ranked No. 1 in The Times preseason poll, beat the No. 5 team 
behind Stovall's 22 points and Pearson's 11. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the timeliness of their scoring that made all the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge held an 8-6 lead through one quarter, which was fortunate given 
that Fountain Valley made only one of 14 shots in the opening quarter. Then 
Pearson took charge. Three consecutive times she drove to the basket, and three 
consecutive times she scored, igniting the Warriors to a 23-12 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference in the first half was shooting -- Woodbridge made 10 of 26 in 
the first quarter, Fountain Valley made four of 27 (14.8%). But the Barons made 
a run in the third quarter and closed to nine points, 37-28, with 1 minute 33 
seconds left, when Stovall went off, making four straight baskets, and the rout 
was on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt hot," said Stovall, who made nine of 14 shots, including eight 
consecutive at one point. "I just wanted to do what was necessary to keep the 
momentum going our way." 
</P>
<P>
 That impressed Fountain Valley Coach Carol Strausburg. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to have kids who know when to step forward to make a difference, 
and they have that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Burgess had 12 points and 10 rebounds, one fewer rebound than 
tournament most valuable player Krissy Duperron (three points). 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge Coach Eric Bangs said his team successfully completed the first 
segment of the season and will now concentrate on the second -- the Santa 
Barbara Tournament of Champions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The eight days off will be good for us -- we can put some new stuff in," 
Bangs said. "We want to go to the next step, but right now, we're right where 
we want to be." 
</P>
<P>
 In the third-place game: 
</P>
<P>
 Estancia 49, Cerritos Gahr 47 -- Jill Black's basket with 1:20 left gave 
Estancia a 48-47 lead, and Jessica Waltz added a free throw to put away Gahr. 
Waltz had 17 points, including four three-pointers, as Estancia (4-1) won the 
third-place game. Nicole Oliver had 20 points for Gahr (4-2).

 Westlake High's disciplined half-court approach was no match for Washington's 
up-tempo attack and the Warriors fell, 78-56, Friday night in the championship 
game of the Thousand Oaks tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Patrick Blake scored a game-high 29 points for the Generals (5-1), 
including 23 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington employed a full-court press and a quick transition game to take a 
12-3 lead. Westlake (2-1) regrouped and took a 38-35 halftime lead, but was 
outscored, 19-6, in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Smiley and Billy Miller each scored 12 for Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Park 62, Thousand Oaks 59 -- Oak Park took fifth place after blowing 
nearly all of a 19-point lead, but lost guard Brandon Creason for at least a 
month when he collided with a teammate and broke his arm. Shawn Williams led 
the Eagles (2-4) with 21 points.

CHATSWORTH SWATS YOUNG RESEDA; GIRLS' SOCCER: POWERFUL CHANCELLORS WIN, 8-0, 
OVER FIRST-YEAR TEAM THAT INCLUDES 21 FRESHMEN.

 Five goals and an assist by sophomore forward Denise Paul led Chatsworth High 
to an 8-0 victory over Reseda in a girls' soccer match Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chancellors (4-0) have outscored their opposition, 31-0, this season and 
did not allow a shot on junior goaltender Ariella Loewenstein.Reseda's senior 
goalie Brenda Lomeli had 16 saves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other than the Granada Hills game (a 5-0 Chatsworth victory), we've been able 
to dominate everyone we've played," Coach Jack Sidwell said. "No one's been 
able to keep the ball in our half of the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Sidwell substituted freely and the Chancellors suffered occasional lapses in 
concentration. 
</P>
<P>
 But even after starters Paul, Pamela George (one goal, one assist) and Ember 
Lee (one goal, one assist) had departed, the pressure was maintained by 
reserves such as Brianna Preis and Corinne Briers (one goal). 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda Coach Yidnekatchew Hailu was upbeat despite watching his team fall to 
0-3. Reseda began a girls' soccer program only this year. However, Hailu 
admitted he chose not to tell his team about Chatsworth's tradition prior to 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't tell them about Chatsworth's five straight (City Section) 
championships because they would have been frozen, but I told them we're 
learning," said Hailu, whose 23-player roster includes 21 freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three years from now we will be able to beat Chatsworth."

BOYS' BASKETBALL / IN-N-OUT BURGER / CONVERSE CLASSIC; TRABUCO HILLS DEFEATS 
SANTA ANA VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Ana Valley still appears to be trying to find itself, while Trabuco 
Hills looks in midseason form. The result was a 75-70 Trabuco Hills' victory 
Friday night in the semifinals of the In-N-Out Burger/Converse Basketball 
Classic at Trabuco Hills High. 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills (4-0) will play Tustin (5-0) at 8:15 tonight for the tournament 
championship. Santa Ana Valley (3-3) will play Sonora (2-2) in the third-place 
game at 6:30 p.m. Both games are at Capistrano Valley High. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams started with a flurry of turnovers Friday, but Trabuco Hills 
eventually settled down once it figured out Santa Ana Valley's press. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we were a little nervous at the start coming off last year's loss to 
them," said Trabuco Hills forward Jonathan Paisley, who scored 20 points as did 
teammate Rob Warnick. "Once we figured out we could play with them, we were all 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Valley's two best players, Olujumi Mann and Ike Harmon, never seemed 
to be all right. Mann shot only six of 17 from the field, including two of nine 
from three-point range, and Harmon had only three points and four rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Mann, bothered by a pulled thigh muscle, said his team was tired. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just had a real hard game last night at Crenshaw," he said. "It's hard to 
bounce back off a loss like that. They pressed us all night and we were kind of 
worn out. But we have no excuses. They beat us fair and square. Trabuco Hills 
has a good team." 
</P>
<P>
 After trailing most of the way, Santa Ana Valley actually led, 56-54, with 
6:20 left in the game. But Trabuco Hills went on a 12-0 run, initiated by 
Warnick's three-point play, and Santa Ana Valley never got closer than four 
after that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think they're playing hard every night," Paisley said. "They have a 
lot of talent. But sometimes the other players get caught up in watching their 
three best players." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Paisley said everything is clicking for the Mustangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best team I've played on," he said. "Everyone is being 
unselfish." 
</P>
<P>
 In other In-N-Out tournament games: 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza 73, Long Beach St. Anthony 37 -- Josh Greer scored 20 points for 
Esperanza (4-3) in a consolation game.

LONG BEACH STATE RALLIES, BEATS HAWAII IN FIVE GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When you've been there before, nothing seems insurmountable. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Hawaii tied Long Beach State, 2-2, with a victory in Game No. 4 of the 
Northwest Region semifinals Friday night, the exhausted 49ers knew they could 
dig deep enough to overcome the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 And they did. 
</P>
<P>
 The defending national champions defeated their Big West Conference archrival, 
15-10, in the decisive fifth game that ended with senior middle blocker Traci 
Dahl's kill. The game capped an emotional 15-12, 12-15, 15-11, 11-15, 15-10 
victory at Long Beach's Gold Mine gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach, which has never lost at home during the postseason, will play Ohio 
State -- the region's top-seeded team -- at 7:30 tonight for the regional 
championship at the Gold Mine. The fourth-ranked Buckeyes defeated Pacific, 
15-10, 10-15, 15-11, 15-4 in an earlier match Friday. Combined attendance for 
the two matches was 2,008. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers (27-5) had a 2-1 lead over Hawaii (25-5) after winning Game 3 with a 
boost from senior Nichelle Burton. The All-American outside hitter's two 
consecutive blocks helped the 49ers take it, 15-11. 
</P>
<P>
 The match went to a deciding fifth game when Kee Williams' block gave the 
Rainbow Wahine a 15-11 victory in Game No. 4. Long Beach tied the game, 11-11, 
on a kill by Dahl, but Williams sparked Hawaii with her powerful hitting. A 
kill by Williams, one of her five in the game, gave Hawaii a 13-11 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams and Burton, the Big West Conference player of the year, entered the 
final game tied for the match lead in kills with 21. Dahl had 18 and the 49ers' 
Brita Schwerm had 17. 
</P>
<P>
 The third game was tied, 8-8, but Long Beach outscored Hawaii, 7-3, down the 
stretch. Long Beach led, 12-8, after scoring four consecutive points. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii and Long Beach split their two conference matches during the regular 
season. Long Beach defeated Hawaii in the Northwest Regional final last season 
at the Gold Mine, 15-12, 15-7, 15-7. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rainbow Wahine tied Friday's semifinal match, 1-1, in the second game. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii bounced back from a 4-0 deficit to win, 15-12, when a kill attempt by 
Burton hit the center of the net and fell on the 49ers' side. Long Beach 
trailed, 13-7, at one point, and cut the lead to 13-10 on a kill by Schwerm, 
which could have provided a momentum shift. But Hawaii didn't let up. 
</P>
<P>
 The first game featured three streaks. Long Beach had two, providing the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach took 3-0 lead, but then Williams warmed up. Led by Williams, one of 
the strongest hitters in the nation, Hawaii raced to leads of 8-3 and 11-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams had six kills during the run and Hawaii seemingly had control of the 
game. But the 49ers stayed focused and slowly got back into the game thanks to 
Burton, Dahl and Schwerm. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach regained the lead, 13-12, on consecutive blocks by Dahl. A kill by 
Schwerm and a service ace by Burton gave the opener to the 49ers, 15-12.

 TOO LATE? Merrill Lynch, the major investment firm getting heat as part of 
Orange County's financial debacle, had two free seminars scheduled for next 
Thursday at its Seal Beach office called "Municipal Bond Market: Year-End 
Investment and Tax Strategies." More than a dozen had preregistered to attend. 
. . . Spokesman Larry Yells said Friday: "In light of all that's going on, we 
may decide it's appropriate to reschedule." An hour later, the seminars were 
canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 HE'LL BE BUSY: Here's another event sent into a tailspin by the county crisis: 
The International Marketing Assn. and Cal State Fullerton had scheduled a 
luncheon next Wednesday with the topic, "Orange County's Future: Maximizing the 
Potential Global Village." The speaker: County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez. . . 
. But the supervisor called them late in the week and said sorry, but he might 
be a little busy with emergency meetings next week. . . . He's been replaced by 
an executive with Beckman Instruments. A luncheon spokesman said the topic may 
change too: "Obviously we're scrambling a little right now." 
</P>
<P>
 LOVE HIM TENDER: His passions are Elvis, the West and baseball. So Gary L. 
Hausdorfer -- a 16-year San Juan Capistrano city councilman now stepping down 
-- was touched when his colleagues told him they're naming a baseball field for 
him. It will be part of the city's future sports complex. . . . Hausdorfer 
called it a great honor: "Elvis, you can only hang on the wall." 
</P>
<P>
 NATURE ONLY: Today is one day that Supervisor Thomas F. Riley briefly can set 
aside the fund crisis. Though the bankrupt county reportedly had a tough time 
getting vendors to provide chairs, Riley is to attend the dedication of a 
wilderness park bearing his name, off Oso Parkway near Coto de Caza. It's 
rugged land with six miles of trails for hikers, horse riders and mountain 
bikers, free admission, and no dogs allowed. . . . Park ranger Ginny McVickar 
calls it "low-impact recreation" -- no frills, just rugged nature.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; WARNINGS GOING BACK TO 1982 WENT UNHEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The first warnings that someone besides county Treasurer-Tax Collector Robert 
L. Citron needed to know how he was investing the public's money came in an 
internal audit a dozen years ago. Citron, the report said, needed to document 
his investment policies and procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 The next year, an outside auditor made the same recommendation. And in 1985, a 
grand jury stated it more bluntly: Someone should be looking over Citron's 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 "There appears to be little or no review of investment activity by the County 
Board of Supervisors, chief administrative officer or auditor-controller," the 
grand jury concluded after conducting an investigation of Citron's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jurors issued this now ominous warning: 
</P>
<P>
 "The county would face a potentially dangerous period of transition if the 
experience of the present leadership were to be lost. This risk is particularly 
evident with the treasurer, an elected official, who personally manages an 
investment portfolio well in excess of $1 billion." 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jury report went on to say: "Orange County investment policies, 
processes and cash forecasting procedures are not documented. By contrast, Los 
Angeles County has a well-defined working manual which explains in detail all 
investment policies and procedures." 
</P>
<P>
 More warnings came in an internal 1986 audit. Finally, in a 1993 internal 
audit, came the harshest admonition yet: Citron was knowingly bending the law 
to maximize returns on the now-bankrupt county investment pool, making "risky" 
financial deals and refusing to consult a committee charged with overseeing his 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 But for nearly a decade, no one heeded warning after warning -- although they 
came from inside, outside and from the watchdog grand jury -- that Citron was 
holding all the cards in the treasurer's office, and not allowing anyone a peek 
at his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after the biggest municipal financial collapse in the nation's history, a 
simple question begs an answer: Why didn't someone react to the mounting 
criticism and 12-year push for oversight of the county's maverick treasurer? 
Was everyone in the fund blinded by the money that Citron was earning for them 
until his investments headed south? 
</P>
<P>
 Citron, who has remained largely in seclusion since Sunday, referred all 
questions to his newly hired attorney, David Weichert, a former federal 
prosecutor turned criminal defense attorney. Weichert defended one of the 
executives in Charles H. Keating Jr.'s fraud-ridden financial empire and a LAPD 
detective who was one of six narcotics investigators tried some years back on 
federal conspiracy and theft charges. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner, who joined the board four months before the 
critical 1993 audit came out, and board veteran Supervisor Thomas F. Riley 
acknowledged that they had received copies of the audit, but did not remember 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should have been a huge red flag," conceded a pained Steiner, who 
unearthed the audit in his office after news reports Friday morning. "(The 
audit) did not get on the board agenda. It simply was not visible." 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing here that required a policy change," Riley said. He added 
that he did not think the audit was overly critical of the treasurer's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, I didn't," Riley said, noting, however, that his office gets 
deluged with paperwork every day. "I see an awful lot of things in this office. 
This was Aug. 5, 1993. I've almost lived a lifetime since then." The three 
remaining supervisors said they could not locate their copies of the audit. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder said that in hindsight the 12 years of warnings 
should have packed the wallop of "a 2-by-4" -- had she heard of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the environment in those days, he was not questioned," she said. "I feel 
frustrated that I was not in control. . . . I don't remember the grand jury 
report. I don't know, and I don't remember." 
</P>
<P>
 But Wieder, who was on the board when the 1985 grand jury report was made 
public, said Citron was making so much money that no one thought to question 
the man Wall Street praised and certainly not about affairs they were hardly 
qualified to understand or judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not Wall Street brokers," Wieder said. "We rely on the people we hire 
to do it for us." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, she questioned whether the people charged with oversight needed 
some oversight themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder said she just found out Friday that the monthly reports of investment 
activity that are required under state law to be distributed to board members 
by the treasurer ceased three years ago, "and no one told us." 
</P>
<P>
 She also criticized Auditor-Controller Steve E. Lewis for not placing the 
audit and Citron's response to it in the public realm. The audit and answer 
were marked "Not for Board Agenda" and were distributed directly to 
supervisors, the district attorney and the county administrative officer. But 
they were not included in the packet of board material that is made public 
before the weekly board meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Lewis) might be covering his rear. How do I know?" Wieder said. 
</P>
<P>
 She fired off a letter to Lewis Friday afternoon, criticizing him for not 
personally alerting board members to the internal audit's inflammatory 
contents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am shocked and disbelieving that you did not ensure that it would be 
brought to our attention personally or to (the attention of) the county 
administrative officer," she wrote. "I can only conclude that it was 
carelessness, indifference or bureaucratic evasiveness."  
</P>
<P>
 Wieder demanded to know why it took 18 months to complete the internal audit, 
why the findings of the report were not pursued more aggressively, and where 
the standard six-month follow-up report was. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis declined to comment on the audits Friday, or to answer questions about 
Citron's efforts to comply with his office's recommendations. He was also 
unavailable to comment on how he could issue such a critical report of Citron 
in August, 1993, and then offer a ringing public endorsement of Citron the next 
spring when Citron drew his first political challenger in 24 years in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said he did not recall getting the report and did 
not review it until Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a mystery to me as to why we did not see the report or why it would not 
have found its way to us," he said. "We didn't have it." 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the report did not necessarily warn of impending crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not uncommon for some of these audits to contain differences of 
opinion, where the auditor-controller suggests certain methods of operation, 
and the other department head disagrees," he said. "When you look to all the 
people who have been involved in investing, participating, evaluating, 
monitoring the investments, there were no glaring signs or signals being 
transmitted that something was awry." 
</P>
<P>
 The internal audit specifically warned supervisors that when Citron "deviated 
from guidelines established by government code or the investment committee, he 
did so without consulting anyone in the treasurer's office or on the 
committee." 
</P>
<P>
 Citron also told auditors that when he violated government codes "the 
instances were conscious decisions made to maximize returns." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi said Friday that he did not know 
if his office had received a copy of the audit. However, after reviewing it, he 
said there was nothing in it that would have "triggered action" by his 
department. If laws were broken, they were of a civil, not criminal, nature, 
and were not the responsibility of his office. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez said that because he did not begin his term on the board until 1987, 
he could not comment on the earlier audits or the grand jury report. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said someone should have taken note of the repeated criticisms over the 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't judge as to whether it could have averted the crisis. If there were 
suggestions or deviations from government regulations or laws, then a red flag 
should have gone up by those who had the opportunity to read it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said allegations that Citron violated state law concern him now, but "I did 
not have the benefit of that report, nor was it ever brought to my attention." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to a five-member group of grand jurors charged with investigating 
Citron's office's investment procedures in 1985, county supervisors should have 
started some reforms a decade sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the jurors found that Citron was "making effective use of the variety 
and sophistication of the broad range of investment instruments," they were 
concerned that no one but Citron knew how he juggled the tools. 
</P>
<P>
 As did the audits in 1982 and 1983, the grand jury urged that Citron put his 
investment style on paper and "maintain written procedures covering all major 
areas of the investment and cash management functions" because his activities 
"affect virtually all of the county's operations." 
</P>
<P>
 The grand jurors also urged that Citron provide supervisors with monthly 
reports detailing the types of investments, the institutions they were from, 
the dates of their maturity, the amounts of deposit, the current market value 
for all securities with a maturity of more than 12 months and the rate of 
interest. 
</P>
<P>
 An internal audit in 1986 conducted by the county auditor-controller echoed 
many of the same concerns, saying that many of the complicated financial 
maneuvers in the treasurer's office "are often performed and understood by only 
one person." It again called for written policies and procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1986 audit refers to many of the findings of the 1982 internal audit, the 
outside 1983 audit and the grand jury report. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to the 1986 audit, Citron said that written policies and procedures 
are prepared to "solve a problem in a particular area" as problems arise, 
adding that "in these difficult economic and budgetary times we do not deem it 
appropriate to request resources specifically for this purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 The auditors bluntly said Citron "should develop policies and procedures prior 
to the occurrences of problems rather than in response to them." 
</P>
<P>
 The audit also criticized Citron for failing to submit investment policies for 
1986 and 1987, despite a board resolution to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "The treasurer has obtained good yields on his investment of county funds," 
the auditors said. "Even so, we believe it prudent for the Board of Supervisors 
and the county administrative officer to become more involved in the county's 
investment program." 
</P>
<P>
 And in another now-eerie warning, the auditors cautioned that "the investment 
function has a tremendous impact on the funding of the county's entire 
operations and the added participation of the board and CAO should help ensure 
that investment strategies and policies best serve the county." 
</P>
<P>
 The audit recommended setting up an investment committee as a way of "assuring 
a long-term, consistent investment strategy." It is this committee that 1991 
auditors found that Citron was pointedly dodging when he made "risky" or 
"unusual" investments. Until last week, the committee, according to the 1991 
audit, was made up of Citron, now-Acting Treasurer Matthew Raabe and County 
Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Schneider said there was "no way" the committee could have forced 
Citron to do anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe the board can be held responsible for what another elected 
public official has done," he said. "I can't do everyone's job. I can only do 
my job, and I think I do it pretty good. Until this episode, we have done 
stellar work." 
</P>
<P>
 In his response to the 1986 audit, Citron argued against establishing an 
investment committee, saying that such a panel "not only removes the investing 
of public funds from those most capable to perform this important task, it 
would also make the county unable to react quickly to investment opportunities, 
which could materially affect interest earnings."

JURY CONVICTS SHUE OF KIDNAP IN 15 MINUTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal jury took less than 15 minutes Friday to convict a Michigan parolee 
of kidnaping a Castaic real estate agent, rejecting defense claims that the 
married saleswoman made up a tale of terror to conceal a romantic escapade. 
</P>
<P>
 The conviction of Timothy Daniel Shue ended a four-day trial whose centerpiece 
was the emotional testimony of Paula D. Harrington. The 27-year-old woman wept 
as she described a terrifying two-day trip to Arizona, telling the 10-man, 
two-woman jury that Shue forced her at gunpoint to withdraw cash for him, 
purchase camping equipment and submit to him sexually. 
</P>
<P>
 Found bound and gagged July 1 in a Gila Bend, Ariz., hotel room, Harrington 
clutched a bouquet of flowers and hugged friends and family Friday as they 
marveled over the jury's swift verdict in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still processing it," she said, declining further comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant U.S. Atty. Debra W. Yang called the verdict "a wonderful result," 
adding: "Justice was done." 
</P>
<P>
 Said one of Harrington's supporters, "I guess honest people recognize honest 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Shue, 38, was scheduled for sentencing on March 6 by Judge Edward Rafeedie and 
is being held without bail in federal custody. Convicted of one count each of 
kidnaping and using a firearm, he faces a maximum term of life in prison 
without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordeal began June 29, when Shue posed as a customer named Steve Sterling 
and phoned Harrington at the Castaic Century 21 office where she worked. He 
asked her to show him residential properties, saying he wanted to move quickly, 
Yang recounted. 
</P>
<P>
 After complimenting a sunny master bathroom at a remote home in Val Verde, 
Shue pulled out a handgun, ordered Harrington to the floor, hogtied her and 
told her that if she didn't cooperate, he'd kill her, Yang continued. 
</P>
<P>
 The threats continued for the next two days as they drove to Hacienda Heights, 
Redlands, Indio, the Salton Sea, Yuma, Ariz., and, finally, Gila Bend. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Shue told Harrington he only wanted money for a final bit of fun 
before he died of a brain tumor, Yang reminded jurors. But he refused to 
release her even after her bank ATM card was rejected and cruelly reneged on 
promises not to rape her, Yang said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue confessed to FBI agents after his arrest at an Ogden, Utah, bar July 6, 
saying he had picked Harrington's picture out of a real-estate ad that made it 
seem to him like she earned a lot of money, Yang said. 
</P>
<P>
 During a forceful closing argument Friday morning, a lawyer for Shue 
challenged Harrington's account and compared her to Susan Smith, the South 
Carolina mother accused of drowning her two young sons and publicly claiming 
they were abducted. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Federal Public Defender Ellen Barry told jurors Harrington had 
willingly run off with Shue and was never truly afraid of him. Barry said 
Harrington had concocted a nightmare tale of abduction and rape to save her 
marriage, gain media attention and clinch a movie deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Susan Smith drove her children to the bottom of a lake and got on TV and wept 
and begged for their return," Barry said in her closing argument, drawing 
objections from prosecutors. "How different is Paula Harrington from Susan 
Smith?" 
</P>
<P>
 Urging the jury to question a lack of physical evidence, Barry noted that no 
hair or clothing fibers were introduced as evidence to prove Harrington rode 
hogtied in the rear of Shue's Jeep, even though FBI technicians vacuumed a 
canister of debris from the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was no proof, Barry said, of scratches on the Jeep or paint left on 
a chain-link fence, despite testimony that Shue must have crashed through the 
gate of a Val Verde home when he fled with Harrington. 
</P>
<P>
 But the jurors apparently agreed with prosecutor Yang, who called the evidence 
against Shue "overwhelming . . . evidence which woven together completely 
corroborates itself." 
</P>
<P>
 The abduction by Shue, a convicted armed robber, ended a two-month rape and 
robbery spree across several states, according to authorities. His conviction 
Friday will probably affect several other investigations, Yang said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shue was not charged with rape in Harrington's assault because the federal 
government has no jurisdiction over that crime.

POLICE KILL DRIVER WHO TRIED TO HIT BICYCLE OFFICERS 
</P>

<P>
 Police on Thursday night shot to death a motorist who earlier had tried to run 
over two bicycle patrol officers, a department spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Lewis, 33, died of multiple gunshot wounds after being pursued by two 
Northeast Station officers in the Mt.Washington area, said LAPD Lt. John 
Dunkin. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunkin said the two gang-suppression officers, who spotted Lewis' car parked 
in an alley Thursday night, were unaware that he had fled several hours earlier 
from two bicycle patrol officers who had been trying to question him about an 
open container of alcohol in his car. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the course of the two officers investigating the open container in the 
suspect's car, he came over and became confrontational," Dunkin said.  
</P>
<P>
 Police said Lewis jumped in the car and tried to run over the officers as he 
fled. 
</P>
<P>
 A check of Lewis' license plate by the gang officers a few hours later 
revealed that he had an outstanding felony warrant from an earlier incident and 
was considered armed and dangerous, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers said that as Lewis pulled out of the alley, they followed him and 
tried to pull him over. Police said Lewis refused to stop and led them on a 
15-minute chase that ended when he ran a red light on Figueroa Street and 
crashed into two cars that were westbound on Marmion Way. 
</P>
<P>
 When the officers approached Lewis' car, they saw him holding a knife and 
struggling with his passenger, Delia Mendoza, 27, investigators said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was apparently an ongoing dispute between her and the suspect," Dunkin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers used pepper spray on Lewis in an effort to subdue him, officials 
said. They said that when the pepper spray failed to to stop him from attacking 
Mendoza, the officers fired two rounds at him.

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; A SCHOOL'S TRIAL BY FIRE AND FINANCE; EDUCATION: 
LAGUNA BEACH CAMPUS WAS GOING TO BE REBUILT AFTER HEAVY DAMAGE IN LAST FALL'S 
BLAZE. NOW, THAT'S ON HOLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The students and faculty of Thurston Middle School, the hilltop campus that 
was badly damaged more than a year ago in the Laguna Beach firestorm, received 
yet another blow Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 As classes broke for the weekend, the 530 pupils took home a notice from the 
Laguna Beach Unified School District saying that the district has put all new 
construction on hold until it can better assess how the district's finances 
will be affected by the county's bond crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 What that means for Thurston, school officials said, is a sudden derailment of 
the school's plans to go to bid this month to hire a contractor for a 
$2.6-million construction project to replace 14 classrooms lost in the fire.  
</P>
<P>
 The hope was that construction could start in February and that by next 
December students could move out of the portable buildings on the athletic 
field that serve as temporary classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just planning the groundbreaking ceremony this week," Principal Cheryl 
Baughn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Baughn said she learned about the construction freeze after the district board 
of directors met in an emergency meeting Friday morning to decide how to 
proceed now that the district's funds, kept in the county treasury, are tied up 
in the county's bankruptcy. The district had received an insurance payment for 
the new construction, which under state law had to be given to the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff members, students and parents at Thurston who had just heard about the 
board's decision said they were saddened, disappointed and a little 
shellshocked by the series of problems the school has been forced to endure 
because of events beyond their control. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard. You think there is only so much you can take," said Marnie Hueg, 
an eighth-grade English teacher. "I think we are kind of in shock about the 
situation. . . . We are tired. You feel you are at the mercy of fate." 
</P>
<P>
 Some students also expressed disappointment. "I feel bad for the sixth- and 
seventh-graders," said Rochelle Rose, 13, an eighth-grader who will graduate 
from Thurston this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose said the students want back the full use of their athletic field and a 
more compact campus. It is a long hike between classes on the main campus and 
those in the portables classrooms arranged along the athletic field. "I have to 
run to be on time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school had planned to build 16 classrooms to replace the 14 lost in the 
fire that had housed every subject except science and to provide added space 
for an anticipated increase in enrollment.  
</P>
<P>
 Angela Irish, the school district's PTA Council president and mother of an 
eighth-grader at Thurston, said the school will cope with this latest problem. 
</P>
<P>
 She noted that the school reopened five days after the fire, accommodating the 
classroom shortage by operating on split sessions for two weeks until the 
portable classrooms arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they weathered the fire, they will be able to weather this," Irish said.  
</P>
<P>
 Baughn was equally confident. "I think we are a resourceful group and we will 
deal with this crisis as we did with the crises in the past," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 One bright note, she said, is that the $50,000 the community raised to build 
an amphitheater at the school as part of the new construction was not deposited 
in the county treasury and thus is not in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul M. Possemato, superintendent of the Laguna Beach Unified School District, 
said that although the classroom construction project has been delayed 
indefinitely, the board decided to forge ahead with construction of the 
amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
 Possemato said the district also will complete construction underway at Laguna 
Beach High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Thurston teachers said that although they would like new facilities, the 
temporary portables are comfortable and adequate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the kids are getting a quality education out there," said Tom Purdy, 
a history teacher who was on a committee of parents, teachers and 
administrators overseeing the construction plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Purdy said the county's assurance that it will continue to fund the salaries 
of teachers and other school staff members outweighs the construction holdup. 
"If put to a vote, everyone would rather get their paycheck," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Thurston's classified employees, including the clerical staff, 
instructional aides and custodians, received their pay and school officials 
said they were certain that next month's payroll for the school's 33 teachers 
also would be met. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Foot, a maintenance worker, said the construction postponement is "just 
another letdown after the school burning." He had been looking forward to 
modern buildings that would require fewer repairs and thus lighten his 
workload, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he expects that the school will do fine. "It is a small community and 
everybody sticks together, " he said. "Things are going to get better. They 
have to."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; FOR O.C. BONDHOLDER, LEGAL ACTION IS MAINLY A 
MATTER OF PRINCIPLE; COURTS: RETIREE SAYS HE DOESN'T REALLY NEED THE MONEY, BUT 
HE'S STILL MAD ENOUGH TO SUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Leetate Smith is a wealthy man who could live quite comfortably without 
dividends from his $15,000 worth of Orange County bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 77-year-old retiree was so irked by what he perceives as the 
irresponsibility of the Orange County treasurer-tax collector's office that he 
gladly accepted the chance to become one of the first to sue the county, which 
last week admitted that its investment portfolio has lost at least $1.5 billion 
of the value since Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really feel sorry for so many people. I think of how many people counted on 
the (bond) income," said Smith, a retired insurance company president and 
onetime professional saxophonist. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's lawyer, Edward M. Gergosian of San Diego, said he expects that dozens 
of names will eventually be added to the class-action lawsuit as other owners 
of Orange County bonds come forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Named as defendants in the suit are former County Treasurer-Tax Collector 
Robert L. Citron, his then-assistant Matthew R. Raabe, County 
Auditor-Controller Steve E. Lewis and the stock brokerage Merrill Lynch, which 
underwrote much of Citron's bond trading. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County government is not named separately as a defendant, Gergosian 
said, because it has petitioned for Chapter 9 bankruptcy protection. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed Thursday in U.S. District Court in Santa Ana, was followed 
within hours by another nearly identical one also seeking class-action status. 
The principal plaintiff in the second suit is a woman named Janice Morgenstern, 
who could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "When promises are made about the safety of the pool and how pool money is 
invested and we find that they are completely false, it makes us feel like 
there is good cause to file suit," Gergosian said. "I believe a lot of people 
invested in this (with) pension funds, retirement plans, looking for a fixed 
return." 
</P>
<P>
 That was certainly the case for Smith, who had set up a family trust for 
himself and his wife, Myra, to see them through retirement. He is affluent 
enough that he refers to his Orange County bonds as "such a small amount I 
can't even remember who sold it to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it is part of a nest egg built from a lifetime of work that started at 
the age of 17, when he left his native West Virginia to work as a musician 
aboard the liner Normandie in the 1930s, then the reigning queen of the 
Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as I got out of my mother's womb, I knew I was going to get out of 
West Virginia," he said. He went back only briefly to attend college after a 
stint in the Army Air Corps during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith was headed to work in Mexico City for American Airlines as an junior 
executive when he had a chance encounter one day in Phoenix when he went to buy 
some clothes. The stranger persuaded Smith to try the insurance business, which 
became his life's work. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith is a former chairman of the Independent Order of Foresters, a fraternal 
benefit association based in Toronto. Smith has lived in Beverly Hills, the San 
Fernando Valley and, for the past 22 years, about 30 miles north of San Diego 
in Rancho Santa Fe, where he and his wife raised two daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, he lives the kind of model retirement to which most American aspire: 
consulting to the insurance industry, occasional fly fishing in Montana and 
sailing regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 Preparing for retirement, Smith said he bought bonds funds -- usually not 
individual bonds. And when Orange County filed for bankruptcy protection 
Tuesday, Smith knew his strategy was a sound one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately it's the smallest bond I have," he said. "I was really nervous. 
This is not going to affect me at all."

ORANGE COUNTY IN BANKRUPTCY; SCHOOL EMPLOYEES GET CHECKS, BUT OFFICIALS WORRY 
ABOUT FUTURE PAYROLLS; EDUCATION: UNCERTAINTY REIGNS AS DISTRICT AND CITY 
ADMINISTRATORS TRY TO ASSESS IMPACTS OF THE CRISIS ON OPERATIONS, PROJECTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 School employees throughout Orange County breathed a sigh of relief Friday 
after receiving their paychecks on schedule. But school administrators, city 
managers and special district officials worried that future payrolls and 
projects might yet be affected by the county's financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 "For this week's payroll, we have a written guarantee," said Garden Grove 
Unified School District spokesman Alan Trudell. "For next week's, we have a 
verbal guarantee. For the end of December, we have verbal assurances. As dates 
become further away, guarantees become more diluted." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it was a relatively normal day at the schools, with teachers, staff and 
parents throughout the county saying they were struggling to keep their 
equanimity in the face of the week's stunning developments. 
</P>
<P>
 As promised, the school system's 28,000 classified personnel, including aides, 
secretaries, bus drivers and cafeteria workers, received their paychecks on 
time Friday. The county's teachers are not scheduled to be paid until Jan. 3.  
</P>
<P>
 Some officials confessed, though, to feeling more than a little trepidation 
about the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Burnham, president of the board of trustees of the Irvine Unified School 
District, said Friday that he feared the crisis "could lead to the devastation 
of the finest public school system in the state of California" -- his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "This thing is going to slowly peel like the layers of an onion, I'm afraid, 
and smell about as bad as we go along," Burnham said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other actions by cities, schools and special districts Friday: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Yorba Linda Water District and the City of Placentia, in separate 
actions, announced that all capital improvement projects have been placed on 
hold. 
</P>
<P>
 * Huntington Beach sent out a memo with its paychecks hoping to reassure 
worried employees that the city had sufficient funds to continue all daily 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Anaheim, with several major development projects hanging in the balance, 
organized an internal crisis team that will meet each weekday to assess the 
financial situation. 
</P>
<P>
 * The boards of the Newport-Mesa Unified School District, the Laguna Beach 
Unified School District and the Saddleback Community College District followed 
several other school boards in directing Orange County officials to keep their 
funds separate from the failed investment pool that triggered the county 
bankruptcy. The Anaheim Union High School District will meet today and is 
expected to take similar action. 
</P>
<P>
 * Laguna Beach Unified School District trustees also passed a resolution 
asking the county supervisors to meet as soon as possible with school board 
representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Laguna Unified Supt. Paul M. Possemato said, county officials have 
spent far more time meeting with major investors than with school 
representatives, the latter of whom had no choice but to invest in the troubled 
pool. Possemato said he worried that the schools might be the last to get their 
money out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The State of California requires that children be educated," the 
superintendent said. "Whether (school districts) have only 14% of the pool or 
not, I believe that the county must reply to that mandate first. . . . We must 
be protected." 
</P>
<P>
 As city and school district officials grappled with the situation, parents 
were also feeling the stress. Despite reassurances from school district 
officials, some say they are upset and fearful of possible ill effects on the 
quality of their children's education. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan O'Conner, 34, said Orange County's bankruptcy status is of special concern 
because he has three children in the Los Alamitos Unified School District, and 
his wife, Barbara, is the principal of a Huntington Beach school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It affects me profoundly. Our main concern is payroll, but from what I 
understand, they're going to pay the payroll and leave the bills," O'Connor 
said as he picked up his children at McGaugh Elementary School in Seal Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we ever hear is that we don't have enough money," said Lynn McLain, 40, 
as she sat in her mini-van waiting for her son Nathan, a fourth grader at 
California Elementary School in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had $1.5 billion to lose, why didn't we give it to the schools?" McLain 
asked. "I have four children in school. It's definitely going to affect us in 
one way or another." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, six city managers met in Irvine on Friday morning to discuss the 
crisis but said they were still unable to assess the full impact on their 
cities because "the situation changes by the minute," as Anaheim City Manager 
James D. Ruth put it. 
</P>
<P>
 The managers, acting on behalf of the 29 cities that are participants in the 
investment pool, are expected to hire legal counsel next week to represent 
them. They said they are most concerned about receiving property tax money due 
to them this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim, for instance, is expecting two payments totaling $15 million from the 
county fund within the next four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't get the property tax disbursements, that could present a problem 
with cash flow for many cities," said Irvine City Manager Paul O. Brady Jr. 
"It's critical that we get that disbursement out of the fund in a timely 
fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 The managers met with two representatives of Thomas W. Hayes, the county's 
newly appointed financial adviser. The two, former Santa Ana Mayor Daniel H. 
Young and former San Juan Capistrano Mayor Gary L. Hausdorfer, promised the 
group that Hayes would meet with them early next week. Also present was 
Montebello City Administrator Richard Torres, whose city has $47 million 
invested in the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Brady said he hopes city officials will begin to get answers to a number of 
troubling questions now that they have organized and the county has hired 
Hayes. Among their concerns, he said, are whether the investments they have in 
the pool are legally a part of the county's assets and if property taxes the 
cities have already paid are going to be tied up in bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had one week of hysteria," Brady said. "It has been horrendous. We're 
trying to bring calm and reason." 
</P>
<P>
 The advisory group, which consists of the city managers of Irvine, Anaheim, 
Santa Ana, Fullerton, Huntington Beach and Laguna Niguel, will meet again 
Monday to discuss hiring legal counsel to speak for all the cities in their 
dealings with the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each city is taking a look at what it needs to do to protect its own city's 
interests," Brady said. "What we are doing by hiring legal counsel is to have 
one attorney who can speak for us." 
</P>
<P>
 But in some cities, the worries are somewhat less significant. 
</P>
<P>
 In Seal Beach, which has $2 million in the county pool, officials said the 
only project that could be threatened is its plan to continue to buy sand to 
replenish badly eroded beaches.  
</P>
<P>
 But even that project is not of immediate concern. The city does not plan to 
continue the beach rebuilding until next spring, after the rainy season, and 
officials hope the situation will be at least partly clarified by then.

APPELLATE PANEL CONSIDERS RELEASE ON BAIL FOR NESLER, KILLER OF ALLEGED 
MOLESTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three appellate justices took testimony Friday on a possible pre-Christmas 
release for Ellie Nesler, the Sonora woman convicted of killing her son's 
alleged molester in a courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The justices took the case under advisement after a 40-minute hearing.They are 
expected to issue a written ruling by the end of the month, said court clerk 
Kevin A. Swanson. 
</P>
<P>
 Nesler's attorney, Donald Segerstrom of Sonora, told the justices that "clear 
and convincing evidence" was presented to the trial judge that Nesler would not 
jump bail or be a danger to others if released. Once those conditions are met, 
bail is mandatory, Segerstrom argued. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Atty. Gen. Jane Kirkland countered that Nesler's lawyers failed to meet 
those conditions in their initial bail request. 
</P>
<P>
 Nesler was not present at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Supreme Court kicked the case back to the 5th District Court of 
Appeals with instructions to consider bail while her voluntary manslaughter 
conviction is on appeal. The Fresno-based 5th District Court previously 
rejected a bid for bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Nesler, 41, was found to have breast cancer after her conviction in Tuolumne 
County Superior Court last year in a case that spurred a national debate over 
vigilante justice. She began serving a 10-year sentence in January at the 
Central California Women's Facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Nesler shot Daniel Mark Driver, 35, five times as he sat shackled during a 
recess in a hearing April 2, 1993, to determine whether he should stand trial 
on charges of molesting four boys, including her son.

ARCHDIOCESE CRITICIZED IN SEX ABUSE CASE; CLERGY: POLICE SAY CHURCH HAS 
WITHHELD NAMES OF FORMER LONG BEACH PRIEST'S POSSIBLE VICTIMS. CHURCH OFFICIALS 
SAY THEY ARE TRYING TO PROTECT CONFIDENTIALITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK B. WILLIAMS and LARRY B. STAMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Long Beach police detective complained Friday that the Roman Catholic 
Archdiocese of Los Angeles has been withholding key information that could 
strengthen a criminal investigation of alleged sexual abuse by a priest. 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Mike Holguin said at least 10 young men have accused Father Theodore 
Llanos of sexual abuse over a period of several years. However, Holguin said, 
church officials have declined to give police a list of potential victims at 
Llanos' former parish, St. Lucy's Church in west Long Beach. He said that 
although police have interviewed some alleged victims, there may be others who 
have not come forward because of embarrassment or fear of reprisal. 
</P>
<P>
 The archdiocese removed Llanos from his post in September after a young man 
alleged that he had been sexually abused by the priest while a parishioner at 
St. Barnabas Church in the Long Beach community of Bixby Knolls, where Llanos 
served from 1985 to 1989.  
</P>
<P>
 Llanos, who was ordained in 1974, is now in a residential psychological 
treatment facility in Maryland that cares for the clergy. No charges have been 
filed against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Church officials said that when Llanos was removed, he turned over a list of 
at least 10 victims. The Rev. Gregory Coiro, director of public affairs for the 
Los Angeles Archdiocese, said the church has declined to give the list to 
police because it feels obligated to protect the identity of the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been our position all along that we would cooperate with the police," 
Coiro said. "But we cannot do that by trampling on the rights and 
confidentiality of our parishioners." 
</P>
<P>
 Holguin said his department would not release any of the names of the victims 
unless they ask the agency to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy is the latest in a growing number of cases that have forced 
the Catholic Church to dramatically step up its efforts to deal with sexual 
abuse by priests. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishops in the United States in 1993, for example, asked the Vatican to allow 
them greater leeway in removing guilty priests from ministries where they could 
pose a threat to children or women they may have victimized. The Vatican 
approved most of the bishops' requests. 
</P>
<P>
 Most dioceses have adopted written policies to quickly adjudicate charges of 
sexual abuse against priests and to extend counseling and other assistance to 
victims and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 A committee of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops last month urged 
all local dioceses to adopt such policies and offered recommendations to 
strengthen existing policies. Cardinal Roger M. Mahony of Los Angeles is a 
member of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Pope John Paul II called the continuing reports of priestly sexual 
abuse a scandal within the church after U.S. bishops raised the issue with him 
privately. 
</P>
<P>
 In light of the increasing number of cases, archdiocese spokesman Coiro said, 
psychological tests performed in the local seminary training for priests have 
begun to place more emphasis on candidates' sexual attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 Coiro said St. Lucy's has brought in counselors and therapists to help 
parishioners deal with the incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Father Tom Economus, the head of a national group representing victims abused 
by Catholic priests, Friday called on Mahony to support the police 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Cardinal Mahony has a moral obligation to the victims, their families 
and the church," Economus said. "He also has an obligation to Father Llanos, 
who seems to be a very troubled man."

BY ANY YARDSTICK, FARRARS MEASURE UP; HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: COACH'S SCRAPPY 
SONS HAVE PROPELLED NORDHOFF'S DRIVE TO CHAMPIONSHIP GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't get the wrong idea when Nordhoff High Coach Cliff Farrar calls his 
youngest son Russell "a tough little booger." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, he still loves him. And what football coach wouldn't? Russell 
Farrar, a 5-foot-7, 160-pound sophomore, has made 159 tackles for his father's 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 And don't be confused when Cliff's wife, Roxanne, calls their oldest boy, 
Brian, "a little demon." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian is really a pleasant teen-ager who attends church regularly, according 
to his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "But he just plays like a little demon," Roxanne said. "He's a scrapper." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian hasn't made as many tackles or big plays as his younger brother, who is 
also a linebacker. But for the sake of family and school, Brian has been 
devilish on defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The diminutive 5-9, 146-pound senior has 103 tackles and nine sacks. He has 
also booted 44 extra points and leads the team with two blocked kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 The sons have helped Nordhoff to a 10-3 record and a berth in the Southern 
Section Division IX championship game. The Rangers play Atascadero tonight at 
7:30 at Nordhoff High. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst football program in Ventura County during the 1980s, Nordhoff is now 
one of the most successful. The Rangers were 23-101 from 1980-89. Since 1990, 
they are 41-18, and champions of the Frontier League three of the past four 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 That's due in no small portion to this feisty and enthusiastic family that 
arrived in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "What a dream for a coach, going to the (Southern Section) championship game 
and your two sons are on the team," Roxanne Farrar said. "For me, it's 
ecstatic. I have tons of film of my boys making great hits." 
</P>
<P>
 Roxanne met Cliff 22 years ago when he was an assistant at Simi Valley. Within 
two months, on Dec. 2, 1972, they were married. Cliff celebrated the couple's 
anniversary last week by playing bingo with his team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't mind," Roxanne said. "I'm a football person. I help break down the 
game film. I keep telling him I want to coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Farrar was groomed for coaching at Oxnard High, quarterbacking his team to the 
Channel League championship in 1966. Later, he played at U.S. International 
University in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 After a series of jobs as an assistant at area schools, he returned to San 
Diego in 1978, working until 1986 as an assistant at Fallbrook High, which won 
the San Diego Section Division I championship in '86. Farrar then searched for 
a head-coaching job that would bring him back to Ventura County, where his 
parents and two brothers still live. 
</P>
<P>
 Next to Cliff, who stands 6-0, 175 pounds, the Farrar boys appear younger than 
17 and 15. But Cliff wasn't much bigger in high school: 5-10, 145. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian and Russell, however, are fearless and reckless on the field, but smart 
and fundamentally sound, not surprising for children of a football coach. 
</P>
<P>
 They relish running through big linemen and toppling quarterbacks, fullbacks, 
tight ends . . . you name it. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Russell: "I think it's rad, all three of us together having fun, going 
for No. 1. My mom, grandma, grandpa, uncles up in the stands." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian and Russell, elementary-school kids when the Farrars arrived in Ojai, 
were waterboys who dreamed of wearing the royal-blue-and-gold Ranger jersey. 
Roxanne was Nordhoff's cheerleading adviser. Daughter Danielle, now in college, 
was a stat girl. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Brian joined the varsity in 1993, Cliff's teams already had won 
back-to-back league championships. On this year's team, Brian became a leader 
during a seven-game winning streak after the Rangers started 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
 During the winning streak, Brian reinstituted an old practice drill. After 
each tackle, the entire defensive unit sprints to the downed ballcarrier. Since 
then, the Ranger defense been a relentless, swarming, gang-tackling bunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew before the season that there would be a leadership void on defense," 
Cliff said. "We just kept waiting for someone to step forward. And finally he 
did. Brian's brought enthusiasm and spirit back to the defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Russell was ranked second in the Southern Section in tackles last week. He has 
become the team's most-exciting player, behind running backs Dallan Rigby (840 
yards rushing, 12 touchdowns) and Josh Hawkins, a Division I college prospect 
who has 33 touchdowns and an area-best 2,320 rushing yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Big plays? Russell has scored five touchdowns, one on a 45-yard interception 
in the Frontier League championship game against Moorpark, another after a 
94-yard return of an interception in which he was dragged down on the two-yard 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 Cliff let him run it in for a score on the next play. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell has five interceptions, two fumble recoveries, two fumbles caused and 
a blocked kick. He does everything but play quarterback -- and he's the team's 
backup. But he practically refuses to play the position because there's no 
contact. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a kid, nothing was more fun to him than to be thrown around by the 
football players," Cliff said. "They would wrestle him and throw him into a 
trash can. He thought that was the greatest." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Farrar boys made big plays in the biggest victory of their father's 
coaching career, a 30-19 victory over Santa Ynez in the sectional semifinal 
last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian returned a fumble 35 yards for a touchdown that gave the Rangers an 
early 10-0 lead. In the fourth quarter, with Nordhoff clinging to a 19-13 lead, 
Russell broke through a 225-pound tackle and a 240-pound fullback to sack 
Pirate quarterback Josh Fiske on fourth down. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was really the game-clinching play, and what he did was not in the 
scheme of the defense," Cliff said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked him the other night, 'Son, where did you come from?' He said, 'Dad, I 
just sensed it.' 
</P>
<P>
 "A sophomore making that kind of play is just great." 
</P>
<P>
 Team members apparently harbor no jealousy toward the coach's sons. 
</P>
<P>
 "That doesn't make them any different," said Hawkins, who also plays defensive 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the guys on defense look up to them. Look at Russell, he's a little 
guy making big hits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brian, since his freshman year, he's been called 'fearless.' That's a good 
nickname. He's 150 pounds laying hits on guys 180, 200." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Cliff concedes to paternal pride when discussing his 
football-playing sons. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a head coach (and) father you don't want to make it sound like your sons 
are the heart and soul of what's going on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the two boys have played real well. As a father, I'm very proud of them."

VALLEY QUARTERBACK ARELLANES SAYS HE'LL PLAY FOR FRESNO STATE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Quarterback Jim Arellanes of Valley College, who set a state passing record 
and several school marks this season, said Friday he will sign with Fresno 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really tough (to make a decision)," Arellanes said."It was between 
Fresno State and Memphis (State)." 
</P>
<P>
 Arellanes, 6 feet 4 and 212 pounds, passed for a school single-season and 
career-record 3,908 yards to lead the Monarchs (10-1). He set Valley 
single-season marks with 246 completions and 30 touchdowns. The touchdown total 
tied a career record set by Barry Hanks in 1986-87. Arellanes compiled his 
marks in only one season. 
</P>
<P>
 Arellanes also established a state single-game passing record with 639 yards 
against Bakersfield on Nov. 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Arellanes, a sophomore transfer from Northern Arizona, played at El Rancho 
High in Pico Rivera. He said that Fresno State's proximity to his home was a 
major factor in his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents really want to see me play," Arellanes said. 
</P>
<P>
 They'll get a chance to see him at the Rose Bowl next season when the Bulldogs 
face UCLA in a nonconference game Sept. 30. FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ

BRANCHING OUT; THROW THE LIGHTS ON IF YOU MUST, BUT THE AMBITIOUS TREE TRIMMER 
TAKES THE TIME TO GET THEM ON JUST SO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON COHOON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Do your Christmas trees look like they were decorated by Charlie Brown -- 
especially compared to the dazzling ones in department stores? 
</P>
<P>
 The main difference between home and commercially decorated trees, say 
professional tree decorators, is the way their lights are attached. 
</P>
<P>
 Professionals each have their own methods, but there are specific things that 
most do or do not do. For instance, they don't leave wires hanging from 
branches. They don't cross a string of lights to a new branch without returning 
first to the tree trunk. They attach lights to a branch by looping the wire 
once around to hold the cord in place. They light the entire tree. They keep 
cords neatly aligned at the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 The advantage of these methods is that the cord becomes almost invisible, and 
the tree is evenly lit. You don't notice the lights themselves so much as the 
effect they create. And that's what you want. 
</P>
<P>
 "From a decorator's point of view, the tree is just a mannequin," says 
Maryrose Goodwin, a representative of Barcana Trees who has strung thousands of 
lights and taught others her method in workshops. "The ornaments are the point. 
They're the clothing. And the lights are just that -- lights. They're only 
there to illuminate the ornaments." 
</P>
<P>
 One big disadvantage of this method is that it's time-consuming. Another 
drawback is cost. Lighting each branch and attaching bulbs to the tree by their 
cords uses up light sets quickly. You'll need at least nine sets, as an 
example, to illuminate a seven-foot tree. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're up to the work and materials, here's what you'll need to get 
started: 
</P>
<P>
 * Mini-lights, at least one set (50 bulbs) for each foot of tree up to five 
feet, plus two sets per foot for each remaining foot up to seven feet; and 
three sets of lights per foot for each remaining foot up to 10 feet. For 
example, you'd need at least 12 sets for an eight-foot tree. Use mini-lights, 
not the larger C-7 or C-9 lights, for this method; Goodwin recommends never 
using C-7 or C-9 lights indoors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Several heavy-duty extension cords. 
</P>
<P>
 * A power strip (necessary if using more than 18 sets of lights and 
recommended as a surge protector in all cases). 
</P>
<P>
 A long-sleeved shirt to protect your arms and a pair of glasses to safeguard 
your eyes are also advised. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional items not absolutely essential but highly recommended, according to 
Goodwin, are a stack of holiday cassettes to pop in your stereo or Walkman and 
a Tom & Jerry or other favorite holiday beverage ready to sip during breaks. 
</P>
<P>
 To begin, plug the first set of lights into an extension cord. Secure the 
light set or the extension cord to the trunk of the tree near its base.  
</P>
<P>
 You can make a loop at the point on the string where the first bulb from the 
plug is located, and the bulb will hold the cord in place. Run the cord 
straight up the trunk to the top of the tree. 
</P>
<P>
 "Always work with a lighted line," Goodwin advises. "You don't want to wrap a 
whole section and then find the set doesn't work."  
</P>
<P>
 Pick a branch at the top and, starting from the trunk, weave the lights into 
the branch to within an inch or two of the tip. For the best effect, try to 
position each bulb so that it points upward and slightly outward. Secure the 
bulbs to the branch by looping the cord around itself -- Goodwin likes to make 
a loop in the cord at each bulb.  
</P>
<P>
 After securing the string at the branch tip with a loop, turn around and weave 
back to the tree trunk. There, you can cross to the adjoining or opposite 
branch and continue weaving. Goodwin does all the branches on one level before 
moving down to the next level. Keep going until you run out of line; then begin 
a new line. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are using straight line, which has a plug at either end, you can plug 
the second light set into the end plug of the first set and keep going. Goodwin 
prefers working with add-on or stacked plugs, which have a plug at only one 
end. 
</P>
<P>
 "I prefer stacked plugs because if you start from the same place with each 
set, it's a lot easier to keep track of them all," Goodwin says. "It looks 
neater, too." 
</P>
<P>
 With stacked-plug light sets, you will secure each succeeding set to the base 
of the tree, just as you did the first, and run the cord up the trunk of the 
tree to the point where you left off with the first set. 
</P>
<P>
 Check the manufacturer's directions to be sure, but generally you can safely 
connect six strings of 50-light sets back-to-back. A caveat: Only plug together 
like sizes of light sets (such as 50 with 50) from the same manufacturer. When 
you begin wrapping your seventh light set, start a new column of plugs. 
</P>
<P>
 If you use an extension cord that has three outlets, you can attach up to 
three columns (or 18 light sets) to that cord. If you need more lights, use a 
second extension cord. If that's the case, you'll also need a power strip. You 
might want to use one anyway as a surge protector. 
</P>
<P>
 When you have the entire tree wrapped in lights, push all the cords running up 
the trunk as close to the trunk and out of sight as possible. Secure them 
together with wire or twists-ties. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's it. 
</P>
<P>
 Sit back and relax -- you've earned it. You may want to leave the fun part, 
putting on the ornaments, for another day. 
</P>
<P>
 If you use an artificial tree, says Goodwin, next year all you'll have to do 
is the fun part. There's no reason to unwrap the lights if the tree branches 
are permanently attached to the center pole. If the tree comes in two sections, 
leave a little slack cord between the top and bottom sections for packing 
purposes.  
</P>
<P>
 Panel type trees, in which several major sections hang from the top of a 
hollow-centered tree, can also be stored with wrapped lights, Goodwin says. 
Just wrap each panel separately. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the holidays wouldn't be the same for you without a real tree, though, and 
you can't see spending most of a day to light it for such a short period, just 
do it the same old Charlie Brown way you always have and don't feel guilty 
about it, Goodwin says. 
</P>
<P>
 "People I visit during the holidays always seem apologetic about their trees 
because they know tree-trimming is part of my job, but I never look at other 
people's efforts critically," she says. "Perfection isn't what Christmas is 
about." 
</P>
<P>
 (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC) How to String a Tree 
</P>
<P>
 Lighting a Christmas tree the way the pros do requires patience and lots of 
lights. In the end, the tree is evenly lit and there are no cords showing. Plan 
to use at least two strings of 50 lights per foot of tree height. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 1. With plug-in at the bottom, bring light string up along tree trunk to top 
of tree. You can use an extension cord starting part way up the trunk or at 
bottom of tree. You'll be putting lights on the tree starting at the top and 
working down. Always plug in light sets before using to make sure they work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 2. Weave light strings individually around branches, securing them in place at 
trunk and at end tip by wrapping the cord around itself. Start at center and 
work toward the branch ends, then double back to the center of tree. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 3. After you've finished a branch, complete the others in that row before 
moving down to next row. To keep cord from showing, don't cross to a new branch 
unless you have returned to the tree trunk. Depending on light style, plug 
strings end-to-end or stack plugs together, keeping cords and plugs neatly 
arranged at trunk so they don't show. For safety, don't stack more than six 
sets of lights on a plug. When you reach the bottom of the tree, weave any 
extras into the lower branches.

A HELPING HAND: INSIDE & OUT; FAULTY DRYER CAN CAUSE DAMP WALL 
</P>

 Q. We recently painted our laundry room with a semi-gloss enamel. The walls we 
painted over had been done in a flat finish. Now, whenever we run our gas 
dryer, we find that the walls become damp. Is this a result of using a 
semi-gloss? 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A. I'd suspect a problem with the dryer rather than the paint, says Jim Craig 
of Decratrend Paint in Anaheim. When the dryer was reinstalled, if you moved it 
out to paint behind it, you may not have hooked the vent up properly. If that's 
the case, moist exhaust is swirling around the laundry room, getting the walls 
wet. If you've used a good quality paint, the moisture shouldn't hurt the 
walls. However, you should make sure you have the venting problem checked, 
because all that moisture can create mildew over time. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q. We've been looking for ideas for a new kitchen floor, and we saw an 
advertisement for one made of cork. How can cork be durable enough to work as 
flooring? 
</P>
<P>
 R.C. 
</P>

 Fountain Valley 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A. The key is the vinyl coating that protects the cork, says Becky Gonzalez of 
Anaheim Centsible Tile. Cork flooring comes in square tiles, and it's very 
durable. It comes in various shades that make it a good option for those 
considering a wood floor. Cork flooring, however, is expensive, so most people 
would rather have a professional install the squares. The warranty that comes 
with it usually requires a professional installation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I'd like to put marble tiles on my fireplace hearth, and I'd like the 
marble to be "bull nosed" around the edges, but having that done is more 
expensive than the tile itself. Why is that, and are there other options? 
</P>
<P>
 C.E.W. 
</P>
<P>
 Fountain Valley 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A. Bull nosing, or rounding or shaping the marble, is a specialized skill 
among tile workers, and it requires special tools, says Gloria Richey of Tile 
Importers in Anaheim. The carbide cutting tips used in the process are 
expensive and don't last very long, and it takes a long time for someone to 
learn the skill, so you have to pay for their services. Someone who isn't as 
skilled in bull nosing can go through a lot of marble before getting the right 
shape. You may want to choose a tile that doesn't have as sharp an edge as the 
one you're looking at, or you may want to try looking at a synthetic tile that 
is more easily made with rounded edges. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I have cable TV in my downstairs den and upstairs master bedroom. I'd like 
to also put it in one of the other bedrooms upstairs; however, I don't want to 
have to snake it along the hallway. Is it OK to just have a line running up the 
exterior of the house from the den up to the bedroom? Is a special type of 
cable needed for the exterior? 
</P>
<P>
 D.S. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A. No special type of cable is generally needed, says Mike McCoy of Current 
Supply in Westminster. Most quality cables are rated for both indoor and 
outdoor use. It's fine to run a cable along the exterior, although you'll want 
to be sure you firmly tack it into place so it doesn't pull out when it gets 
windy. Also, use rubber or plastic grommets or caulk to seal the holes in the 
wall; this will help keep drafts as well as insects from getting inside your 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Our kitchen faucet is five years old and it's in great shape, except that a 
few months ago the spray became blocked and I removed the aerator. I haven't 
replaced it, and we really don't miss it, but a friend said that running a 
faucet without an aerator can cause some damage. Is that true? 
</P>
<P>

<P>

</P>
<P>
 A. The purpose of the aerator, which is at the end of the faucet and which 
screws on and off, is to allow an even flow of water, says Ted Blanke of 
Central Plumbing & Heating in La Habra. Without an aerator, the water splatters 
out. You're not necessarily doing any harm to the faucet, but another function 
of the aerator is to filter out any grit that may be in the pipes. Without that 
filter, you may be drinking or using some of that sediment. Aerators are 
inexpensive and easy to install, so you're probably better off with one on.

 Who doesn't like to be waited on?  
</P>
<P>
 Occasional tables with personality can hold snacks or reading material in 
small spaces and may be just the right piece to complete a playful setting or 
to lighten up a serious room.  
</P>
<P>
 For those with sport in mind, Reginald is a caddie of wood, hand-painted and 
waiting to serve you. 
</P>
<P>
 The piece is part of the Furniture for Golfers collection (which includes golf 
club bookends, a golf ball display cabinet and a sofa table) offered by Global 
Sport Specialties, a division of Global Sports Management in Winston-Salem, 
N.C., which puts on golf tournaments throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
 To purchase Reginald ($99 plus shipping and handling) or any of the other 
pieces in the collection, call (800) 722-6732. 
</P>
<P>
 For an even more loony touch, there is the Warner Bros. Gallery Collection. 
Or, in the words of Tweety, yes, you saw a puddy tat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sylvester end table ($275), a silhouette crafted of buffed black iron, is 
a blend of serious artistry and whimsy. It's branded with the authentic "TW" 
stamp of the studio's renowned artist Tex Welch. 
</P>
<P>
 Also available as end tables are Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig and the Tasmanian 
Devil. 
</P>
<P>
 All can be purchased through the Warner Bros. catalogue (800) 223-6524 or at 
the Warner Bros. Studio stores at the Brea Mall and South Coast Plaza, Costa 
Mesa. Temperate Climates 
</P>
<P>
 The Day & Night thermostat is designed to make controlling your home's 
temperature a simple matter. Not only are the thermostats friendly to use, 
they're mercury-free and made with recycled materials. 
</P>
<P>
 During the design process for the six models that came on the market last 
month, Day & Night interviewed homeowners around the country to see what they 
wanted in an ideal thermostat. Those suggestions were integrated into the final 
product, said Kim Warren, product manager at Day & Night, a division of 
Indianapolis-based Carrier Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the suggestions were large push buttons made of soft rubber, like those 
on a television remote control; a back-lit liquid crystal display for better 
viewing; a clean filter indicator to alert consumers when to clean or replace 
an air filter and an energy savings indicator. The thermostat is controlled 
electronically and doesn't require battery backup to retain memory. 
</P>
<P>
 The thermostat works with any heating and cooling system; it is designed so a 
do-it-yourselfer can install it.  
</P>
<P>
 The thermostats ($95 to $225 with installation) can be purchased from Day & 
Night contractors or by calling (800) 468-7253.

PESTS; SILVER PAINT DISCOURAGES APHIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Entomologist Charles Summers says silver-colored spray paint applied to the 
soil in a planting bed seems to deter some insect and disease problems in 
vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 Summers and another University of California expert, plant pathologist James 
Stapleton, began trying a water-based silver spray paint last year to 
discourage aphids on squash. 
</P>
<P>
 "When an aphid is flying along looking for a place to land, it cues in on 
reflections coming off of plant surfaces," Summers reports in a recent edition 
of California Agriculture, published by the university. "If they see a 
reflection of the sky, the aphids don't land." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea behind keeping aphids from landing is they transmit viruses that 
stunt plant growth, reducing yield and causing deformed, discolored, 
unmarketable vegetables. Peppers and melons are as susceptible as squash. 
</P>
<P>
 Summers and Stapleton, both based at the Kearney Agriculture Center, applied 
the silver spray as a ground mulch in one of eight treatment methods for 
zucchini. 
</P>
<P>
 They reported that plants grown on beds treated with the spray-on silver paint 
produced 3,973 pounds of good-quality zucchini per acre. 
</P>
<P>
 Untreated control beds averaged 867 pounds per acre, but by the end of the 
season 90% of the zucchini was so virus-damaged a harvest was pointless. The 
experiments covered 12 harvests. 
</P>
<P>
 "The treatment works," Summers says. "The silver-spray mulch repels aphids and 
delays the onset of virus infection by 10 days to two weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Summers and Stapleton also reported side benefits: The plants need less water 
because evaporation from the soil surface is reduced, and the crust formed on 
the spray-painted surface suppresses weeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver or white plastic also would help control aphids, they say, but must be 
gathered and disposed of at the end of the growing season while the water-based 
paint is simply incorporated into the soil without harmful effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Aluminum foil also would work but is too expensive in commercial operations. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related story, Michael J. Costello and Miguel A. Altieri describe how 
they used a living mulch of low-growing grasses and legumes as an alternative 
to pesticides in suppressing aphids in broccoli fields. 
</P>
<P>
 They found such a mulch does not reduce crop yields if properly maintained and 
that lower-intensity light reflected from broccoli grown with a living mulch is 
less attractive to aphids. 
</P>
<P>
 "In addition to replacing pesticides, living mulches smother weed growth, 
protect the soil from wind and water erosion, enhance soil fertility and 
structure and reduce soil compaction from heavy equipment," they say. "They can 
play a role in conventional as well as organic agriculture." 
</P>
<P>
 Altieri is an associate professor at UC Berkeley, and Costello is a 
postdoctoral researcher there. 
</P>
<P>
 They said lack of specialized equipment is the main limitation to commercial 
application of living mulches at this time. Their experiments were conducted at 
the Rural Development Center in the Salinas Valley.

<P>
 Buying a carpet is a long-term investment, yet many consumers overlook useful 
care and cleaning procedures that can extend the life and appearance of a 
carpet. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some tips: 
</P>
<P>
 * Shade carpets from direct sunlight and protect them by using mats in 
high-traffic areas.Avoid wearing street shoes indoors -- they bring in dirt; 
avoid walking barefoot, as skin oils can soil carpets. 
</P>
<P>
 * Invest in a quality under-carpet cushion, preferably one made of prime 
polyurethane foam. * Clean up all food or beverage spills promptly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Have carpet restretched if it wrinkles or puckers. Vacuum frequently with an 
upright cleaner and have the carpet professionally cleaned regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Move furniture frequently and put pads under legs. If dents occur, steam 
fibers with a steam iron held above the carpet.

CONSTRUCTION; FILLING IN GAPS ON VARIETIES OF HOME INSULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Modern home insulation works because myriad tiny closed pockets trap air, 
which acts as an insulator. 
</P>
<P>
 Insulation comes in several forms: batts and blankets that fit between studs 
and joists, loose fill that is poured or blown in, rigid foam sheets, and 
liquid foam that is injected into wall cavities. 
</P>
<P>
 All are rated by their ability to resist heat loss (R-value). The higher the 
R-value, the more an insulation will prevent heat loss and cut fuel bills. In 
general, an existing home will benefit most from the addition of batts or loose 
fill between joists in the attic. This where the most heat is lost, and in an 
unfinished attic, it's a job that the homeowner can do easily for moderate 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Blowing loose fill or injecting liquid foam into finished walls is a complex 
process and requires a contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some guidelines: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fiberglass 
</P>
<P>
 Fluffy fiberglass batts and blankets are by far the most popular insulation 
and are standard for most new wood-frame houses. They are economical and easy 
to install. Blankets are long rolls. Batts are simply blankets cut into 4- or 
8-foot lengths. They come in widths to fit between joists and studs spaced at 
standard 16- or 24-inch intervals. Thicknesses commonly correspond to stud and 
joist widths and range from R-11 to R-30 in insulating value. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiberglass is available with or without a vapor retarder. Install any 
insulation so the vapor retarder faces the wall's heated side, which is the 
interior side in all but the hottest parts of the Sun Belt. When installing 
more insulation over existing insulation, use the kind without a vapor retarder 
so moisture won't get trapped between the old and new layers. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiberglass particles can be harmful. Wear a breathing mask, gloves, a 
long-sleeve shirt and a hat when handling fiberglass. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mineral Wool 
</P>
<P>
 Mineral wool is similar to fiberglass. It's available in batts and blankets 
but is most commonly sold in bags as loose fill. It's easy to install. In an 
unfinished attic with no insulation, just lay a sheet of polyethylene plastic 
as a vapor retarder, pour the fill between joists and spread it with a rake. 
</P>
<P>
 Loose fill pours easily into cavities that can't be reached with other 
insulations. But it settles in time, particularly in vertical wall cavities, so 
care must be taken to install it properly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cellulose 
</P>
<P>
 The advantages of cellulose are its low cost and the ease with which it is 
blown into otherwise inaccessible areas. Made of recycled paper, it's treated 
by the manufacturer with a fire-retardant chemical. 
</P>
<P>
 The main disadvantage of cellulose is that it is messy to install. Because it 
is organic, it's also susceptible to moisture retention, which can cause it to 
shrink and lose its insulation value. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Urethane Foam 
</P>
<P>
 Urethane foam is a very effective insulator. It is pumped as a liquid into 
wall cavities, where it solidifies and forms its own vapor retarder. But it is 
expensive and must be installed by a contractor. It also emits a toxic gas when 
it burns and has been banned in some states. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Plastic Foam Sheets 
</P>
<P>
 Three types of rigid plastic foam sheets are commonly used for insulation: 
</P>
<P>
 * Extruded polystyrene is the best choice for below-grade insulation of 
exterior walls and floors because it resists moisture. But it's costly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Expanded polystyrene is the least expensive of the three, but it's not 
moisture resistant. It's commonly used beneath exterior siding as the core of 
foam-core panels. 
</P>
<P>
 * Polyurethane sheets are also used primarily under siding. They give a high 
R-value per inch but are costly. 
</P>
<P>
 All three are flammable. If installed indoors, they must be covered with 
fireproof gypsum wallboard.

REPAIRS; SHUTTING THE DOOR HINGES ON EASY SOLUTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Troublesome doors that spring open or refuse to shut often need only simple 
adjustments. Accumulated paint and loose or misaligned hinges are behind many 
of these common problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rubbing 
</P>
<P>
 If a door rubs, check it and the door frame thoroughly for paint buildup. Sand 
or chisel away any excess paint. If necessary, strip it off with paint remover, 
following all precautions on the paint remover. Prime and repaint the bare 
wood. 
</P>
<P>
 If accumulated paint is not the cause, and rubbing occurs at the top or bottom 
of a door's latch side, try tightening the hinge opposite the area that rubs. 
Open the door and turn each hinge screw clockwise using a long screwdriver for 
maximum leverage. Turning the screws a quarter to half a turn may be all that 
is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 If the door rubs along the hinge side, remove the screws holding the hinge to 
the door frame. Cut a shim (a thin piece of cardboard the same size as the 
hinge leaf), slide it behind the leaf and then reinstall the screws. Test the 
door; if it still rubs you may have to add another shim or place a shim behind 
the lower hinge as well. When hinges are correctly positioned, you should be 
able to close the door and slide a credit card easily between its edges and the 
door frame on all sides. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Springing Open 
</P>
<P>
 A door that springs open by itself may do so because the hinges are not 
aligned vertically or because their leaves are set into the door frame at an 
angle. Check the vertical alignment of the hinges with a plumb bob; if the 
hinges are out of line, remove and reset the lower one. To correct a hinge leaf 
set into the frame at an angle, cut a cardboard shim half as wide as the leaf 
and place it behind the part of the leaf set deepest into the door frame. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes you cannot tighten loose hinge screws because their holes have 
become enlarged. If this affects only one or two screws, remove them, drill a 
small pilot hole that extends each screw hole into the wall stud beside the 
door frame and then replace the original screws with longer ones. If all the 
hinge screws are loose, remove them and the hinge leaf and plug the holes with 
glue-coated dowels. When the glue dries, trim the plugs flush, then use the 
hinge leaf as a guide for drilling pilot holes for the screws. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not Latching 
</P>
<P>
 If a door will not latch because the latch bolt does not engage the strike 
plate on the frame, remove the strike plate and either add a shim beneath or 
file the opening in the plate to enlarge it. If the latch and strike plate are 
severely misaligned, plug the screw holes and reposition the plate higher or 
lower on the door frame. This is easier than repairing a slightly warped door 
or frame and usually is as effective.

ACCENTS; PLATES PRESERVE FLAVOR OF SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Along with mistletoe and evergreen wreaths, holiday china is a tradition of 
the season. Besides dinnerware with holiday motifs, there are at least 100 
different series of commemorative Christmas plates. 
</P>
<P>
 The old favorites are still what sell best. The two most requested 
Christmas-theme china patterns at Replacements Ltd., a mail-order retailer in 
Greensboro, N.C., date back to 1938 and 1974, says company researcher Frank 
Cunningham. Spode's Christmas Tree, introduced in 1938, is requested the most 
and Lenox China's Holiday, introduced in 1974, is the second most popular. 
</P>
<P>
 The prize for longevity goes to Danish Christmas plates, issued each year 
since 1895 by Bing & Grondahl of Copenhagen. The B&G Christmas plate is 
believed to be the first Christmas plate ever marketed. 
</P>
<P>
 Approximately 450 seven-inch plates were made, and each sold for 50 cents. 
That first plate's face bore the date and the inscription, "Jule Aften," which 
means Christmas Eve. The subject was a winter night's view of Copenhagen's 
skyline as seen through a frosted windowpane. Themes of succeeding plates also 
highlight winter and the holiday in Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, a new plate appears on Jan. 1. Any that are not sold by Dec. 31 are 
broken, and the molds are destroyed. The 1994 Christmas plate sells for $72.50. 
B&G declines to say how many plates it manufactures each year. The plates are 
marketed around the world, and tens of thousands are sold in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Danish Christmas plates have been available in this country since the turn of 
the century, but the real growth of popularity started in the early 1970s as an 
outgrowth of the hobby of plate collecting, says Paul B. Steffensen, president 
of B&G. The market for old Christmas plates is served mainly by antiques and 
collectibles dealers. Steffensen recently bought one of the original 1895 
plates from a dealer for $5,200. 
</P>
<P>
 Replacements Ltd. has a running list of more than 440 clients who want to be 
notified when a B&G Christmas plate turns up, according to Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
 The origin of the idea for Christmas plates is a bit of a mystery. B&G company 
lore says that Harald Bing, one of the company's founders, got the idea for a 
special porcelain holiday plate from a long-standing Danish Christmas custom in 
which decorated wooden trays filled with Christmas cookies were given as gifts. 
By 1895, these trays had become elaborate and were being saved and collected. 
Bing decided to market a porcelain version. 
</P>
<P>
 Commemorative porcelain plates not tied to Christmas were made in Denmark as 
early as 1888 when Royal Copenhagen gave away small plates to advertise its 
booth at the Arts, Agricultural and Industrial Exhibition, a world's fair held 
in Copenhagen. Royal Copenhagen later extended the production of commemorative 
plates by making up small quantities of souvenir plates to be given away to 
participants at grand events that usually involved royalty. In 1908, Royal 
Copenhagen began issuing a Christmas plate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once the tradition of the Danish Christmas plate was begun, it continued 
through two world wars, a worldwide depression and even the merger of the two 
companies in 1985. To mark the event, B&G and Royal Copenhagen, arch 
competitors for more than a century, introduced a Union Christmas plate in 
1986. Each company continues to issue separate plates under its own trademark. 
While the blue and white plates are similar, aficionados can tell them apart. 
Both are dated, but the B&G plate also has the words "Jule Aften" or "Jule" 
inscribed on the face. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in January, B&G will mark the centennial of its Christmas plate with 
a variety of events, including a traveling exhibition of all the plates and the 
release of several additional ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans are likely to hang Christmas plates on the wall or to display them 
in a china cabinet. In Denmark, the plates are often used to serve the holiday 
dessert of rich rice pudding. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a fine conversation piece at the table to compare what year plate you 
have," Steffensen says. "The Danes also bring out their collection of Christmas 
spoons to eat the pudding."

MATERIALS; ENGINEERED LUMBER: GREATER THAN ITS PARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perhaps you've noticed, while walking through a church, theater or municipal 
building, a graceful arch or vaulted ceiling supported by large wooden beams or 
rafters. 
</P>
<P>
 And maybe you've wondered how wood can be made to perform in situations such 
as these that seem to stretch the limits of the material's natural 
characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the time, especially in newer construction, these are examples of 
engineered lumber. The concept of manufacturing structural lumber is by no 
means a recent one. Floor and roof trusses, for example, have long been used in 
both residential and commercial construction projects. These products generally 
incorporate lower grades of lumber in items that, by their design, maximize the 
structural value of the material. 
</P>
<P>
 For truss construction, southern yellow pine -- a hard, brittle and relatively 
inexpensive wood -- is most often used. Glue-laminated beams -- large beams 
composed of stacks of two-inch stock laminated under pressure -- have also been 
used to dramatic effect for at least 80 years. In applications that are 
non-structural, the engineered approach has yielded finger-jointed stock for 
many years. 
</P>
<P>
 In this process, short lengths of wood are joined end-to-end for paint-grade 
work, such as baseboards, casings, doorjambs, window jambs, siding and porch 
decking. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, however, the term engineered lumber includes a larger list of products 
that are fabricated from either veneers, strands of wood or lengths of solid 
lumber. These materials are assembled with adhesives, under great pressure, to 
form products that exceed the physical and structural characteristics of simple 
dimensional lumber. 
</P>
<P>
 The products that are considered engineered lumber take a number of different 
forms and are constructed using different techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a look at a few of the products available and the major differences 
between them: 
</P>
<P>
 * The gluelam, or glue-laminated beam, was among the first engineered lumber 
products. These beams are generally used for rafters, floor support beams or 
stair stringers when the structural members are meant to be exposed to view. 
They are constructed by gluing and then applying great pressure to a stack of 
2-by-4 or 2-by-6 stock to form a beam up to 30 inches in depth. On special 
order, these beams can be fabricated to curved shapes for supporting arched 
roof structures. 
</P>
<P>
 * Laminated-veneer lumber, or LVL, at first has the appearance of a plywood 
beam. Instead of alternating the direction of the laminations, however, LVL is 
made of one-tenth-inch-thick veneers that are all aligned in one direction and 
bonded under pressure. LVL is most commonly used for beams and headers when the 
load exceeds what can be supported by a solid wood beam of comparable size. 
This product is generally available in a three-quarter-inch width, ranging from 
9 1/2 inches to 18 inches in depth and up to 45 feet in length. Larger sizes 
may be available from certain manufacturers on special order. 
</P>
<P>
 * Parallel-strand lumber, or PSL, is made from 8-foot-long strands of veneer 
soaked with adhesive and bonded under pressure to form long blocks, up to 66 
feet. This material is appropriate for exposed use as posts and beams, offering 
an alternative to gluelam products. In addition, pressure-treated PSL beams are 
available for outdoor applications such as porches, decks and gazebos.

PROPERTY TAX REVENUES EXPECTED TO STAY LEVEL; GOVERNMENT: AS PAYMENT DEADLINE 
LOOMS, OFFICIALS PREDICT COLLECTIONS TO BE ABOUT SAME AS LAST YEAR'S, DESPITE 
REAL ESTATE REBOUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG RIPPEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With Monday's property tax deadline approaching, Ventura County officials 
project that revenues will be about the same as last year's, despite a 
resurgence in the real estate market. 
</P>
<P>
 Property tax collections are expected to be flat this year partly because 
housing prices have not increased during the 14-month surge in home sales, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, the big concern is that it will actually go negative, which would 
mean less revenue to the county and to the school districts and the state," 
Treasurer-Tax Collector Harold S. Pittman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though far below the 10% yearly increase of the 1980s, the collections now 
flooding county coffers are expected to reach a record $490.6 million for the 
fiscal year that began July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 But that represents a paltry 0.46% gain over the last tax year, compared to a 
jump of nearly 13% in 1990-91 before the effects of the real estate bust were 
seen on tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
 So stubborn is the fall of housing prices that an unprecedented number of 
taxpayers -- an estimated 7,000 -- have filed appeals to have their properties 
reassessed and their tax burden lightened. Pittman said this could drop 
projected revenues even further. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been (here) for 32 years, and that's the largest number of appeals I've 
seen," county Assessor Glenn Gray said. Appeals are up 51% from last year, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even with the fall in home values, tax delinquencies have dropped. Of the 
$488.3 million billed during 1993-94, only about $22.7 million -- or 4.64% -- 
was not paid on time, Pittman said. By contrast, delinquency was 5.19% the year 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the recession began in 1990, the rate of property tax growth has dropped 
each year, from 12.9% in 1990 to 5.3% in 1992 to 2.2% last fiscal year. Not 
even a surge in home sales that began in September, 1993, has helped. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxes have flattened because many houses bought during boom years for top 
prices have lost a portion of their value, he said. A house that sold for 
$400,000 in 1990, for example, might be resold now for $300,000. Property taxes 
are lowered accordingly, Pittman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, Gray has lowered the assessed value of more than 54,000 parcels, 
thereby cutting taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the reduced tax bills, many property owners do not approach their 
twice-a-year tax obligation with great cheer, Assistant Tax Collector John 
McKinney said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're bearers of the message, and it's not always good news we're bringing," 
McKinney said as taxpayers queued at the treasurer's counter in the county 
Administration Building in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Holding a fistful of cash, stucco worker Augustine Valencia, 43, stepped up to 
pay taxes on two houses he owns in Oxnard.

 Camarillo resident Bob Bailey, 46, who was serving jury duty in the adjacent 
courthouse, also paid in person and later said, "I like hanging on to my money 
as long as I can. Sometimes a couple more days of interest can be beneficial." 
</P>
<P>
 Eighty-year-old Ruth Wallace said she has paid her taxes in person each of her 
40 years in Ventura. Casting a glance at the people waiting to be served, she 
added: "Probably some of them gripe. . . . But they get a lot for their taxes."

 Walt Bartholomew, 42, a Port Hueneme resident who was paying his mother's tax 
bill, was not so sure. 
</P>
<P>
 "My complaint is about the unnecessary fat in government that can take away 
from vital services," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 McKinney, while acknowledging taxpayer resentment, added, "Actually, to some 
people who are new to this country, especially those from the former Eastern 
bloc, this is a privilege. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like it's the first time they had a voice in what happens in their 
lives, and some feel like they own something now. After all, it's a tax on 
property." 
</P>
<P>
 Each October, the county mails annual tax bills to the owners of more than 
217,000 parcels -- farmland, residences, businesses and industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the yearly bill, which averages $2,200 countywide, becomes delinquent 
after Dec. 12 and the balance after April 10. The penalty for paying late is 
10% of the taxes due, plus a $10 service fee.

 ORANGE LUTHERAN--Was picked to finish last in the Olympic League. It has 
exceeded those expectations. It was co-champion with Cerritos Valley Christian 
(the first league championship in school history), and has reached its first 
title game. For much of the year, the Lancers have relied on a multifaceted 
offensive scheme that swings from the shotgun to the option, and has allowed 
them to average 31 points per game. In the last two playoff contests against 
Phelan Serrano and San Pedro Mary Star of the Sea, the Lancers relied on 
defense. They got a fumble recovery against the Diamondbacks to win, 22-19, and 
stopped a two-point conversion attempt by the Stars in a 7-6 overtime victory 
in the semifinals. Orange Lutheran again looks to their big three--senior 
quarterback Joe Juliano (1,455 yards passing, 950 yards rushing), junior 
running back Che Holloway (1,139 yards rushing, 19 touchdowns) and sophomore 
receiver Michael Crawford (29 receptions, 502 yards, six touchdowns) to bring 
home the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 MONTCLAIR PREP--Big. Fast. Talented. Here are six more applicable words: It 
doesn't belong in this division. But it is here nonetheless, with an excellent 
shot at winning its second Division X title in four years. The team name is 
Mounties but it should be Raiders, as this is a team Al Davis would love. 
Montclair Prep is plastered with an outlaw image--it does not have a league 
affiliation and plays to intimidate. What the Mounties do best on offense is 
run. Junior Akil Anderson has 1,432 yards and 14 touchdowns, but 871 yards and 
eight touchdowns have come in the past three playoff games. In the 50-8 rout of 
Big Bear two weeks ago, Anderson ran for 418 yards, tying the state single-game 
record set by Agoura's Darrin Rogers in 1985. He also scored four times. 
</P>
<P>
 KEY TO THE GAME--Defense. Orange Lutheran, whose unit has been dwarfed in 
nearly every game this season, cannot allow the Mounties to run. Montclair must 
control Juliano. 
</P>
<P>
 CONSENSUS--Orange Lutheran might be "The Little Engine That Could," but 
Montclair Prep is the big machine that can. Mounties, 28-14. THE LINEUPS

DECORATING; GO FOR THE GREEN (TREE) AT CHRISTMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "O Christmas tree, thy leaves are green forever." Well, maybe not forever, but 
you can keep your tree green longer if you chose it carefully and keep the 
water flowing to its thirsty needles. 
</P>
<P>
 Start by picking a fresh tree that will last through the holidays, advises 
Cindy Becker, spokesperson for the National Christmas Tree Assn., in Milwaukee, 
Wis. Two freshness hints: a forest-fresh fragrance and a rich green color. 
Beyond that, Becker suggests two easy tests: 
</P>
<P>
 First, run your fingers along a branch, about six inches from the tip. Needles 
should stick to the branch and not fall off in your hand. Next, hold the tree a 
couple of inches from the ground and let it drop, stump end first. Only a few 
of the outside green needles should fall off (inside needles do turn brown and 
shed naturally). 
</P>
<P>
 It's best to buy a tree that comfortably fits the spot where it'll stand over 
the holidays. However, it won't hurt to improve the fit by snipping the ends 
off ragged or overly long branches. 
</P>
<P>
 When you get your tree home, cut at least one-quarter-inch off the bottom of 
the trunk. That removes the sappy seal capping the trunk so the tree can start 
absorbing water. "Making that cut is the key to keeping your tree fresh," 
Becker says. 
</P>
<P>
 Put your tree in a water-holding container or stand immediately, even if it's 
going to be a few days before you're ready to set it up and decorate it. 
</P>
<P>
 And make sure to keep the container filled with water (a Christmas tree can 
absorb up to a gallon in the first 24 hours). 
</P>
<P>
 If your tree goes dry, it may lose its ability to absorb moisture by the time 
you remember to add water again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a bouquet of flowers," Becker says. "Once your tree stops absorbing 
water, there's not much that you can do to revive it." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't bother adding a preservative to the water. Though additives ranging from 
corn syrup to aspirin have been touted as making trees last longer, there's no 
evidence that they actually help.

 Calabasas population -- Because of erroneous 1990 census data supplied by the 
FBI, The Times misstated the population and crime rate for the city of 
Calabasas in a graphic on Sunday. Although the city had not incorporated at the 
time of the 1990 census, its population would have been 19,857 residents, 
according to an estimate by Urban Decision Systems of Los Angeles. Based on 
that population, the city had 2,815 crimes per 100,000 people in 1993.

PLAY REFLECTS PAINFUL ERA; W W II VETERAN FINDS POIGNANCY IN STORY ABOUT 
CHRISTMAS IN DETENTION CAMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Harold Harada won the Bronze Star in World War II when the Japanese American 
served as a medic in bloody fighting across Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 But back in this country, his mother, his father, and his wife-to-be were all 
living behind bars -- simply because they were Japanese Americans. Even Harada 
was forced to live in that same desert internment camp for almost two years 
before he was allowed to join the Army. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tears came to my eyes to see barbed wire, guard towers and soldiers with 
machine guns guarding us," Harada said. "We said the Pledge of Allegiance 
almost every day and learned American history. But the camps really brought out 
the feeling that we were different . . . that we were the enemy." 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty years later, the retired Culver City dentist and his wife, Chiye, are 
seeing their painful wartime lives mirrored on stage in a play at the Japanese 
American National Museum in Downtown Los Angeles. "A Jivebomber's Christmas," 
which ends Sunday, is set in an internment camp similar to the one Harada and 
his family were taken to in Topaz, Utah. In the play, a brother goes off to war 
to fight for this country while his relatives in the camp struggle to keep up 
their spirits during the Christmas holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street from the museum is an original barracks from the internment 
camp in Heart Mountain, Wyo., that was dismantled and transported to the museum 
by a group of Japanese Americans who once lived there. 
</P>
<P>
 Saachiko Magwili, a co-writer and co-director of the play, was 3 when she, her 
mother and her sister were taken to the Heart Mountain camp. Both her uncles 
served in the same segregated battalions as Harada, helping to form the most 
decorated unit in U.S. military history. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you celebrate Christmas and (be in a relocation) camp?" Magwili asked. 
"You're talking about a heart with barbed wire around it."  
</P>
<P>
 During the war about 30,000 Japanese Americans served in the U.S. military and 
about 120,000 lived in the internment camps. "I lost both my parents in camp," 
Harada, 71, said. "But the good thing is I met my wife and I've been married to 
her for 46 years." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As Harada watched a rehearsal of the play Wednesday night he recalled with 
some sadness what it was like for him and his family during the war. "The camp 
story needs to be told and retold," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to prove their loyalty, the Niseis, or second-generation Japanese 
Americans, enlisted after answering "yes, yes" to two questions asking if they 
would renounce any allegiance to Japan and if they would fight for the United 
States. Harada answered in the affirmative but felt disheartened by the 
questions because two-thirds of the internees were born in America and most had 
no allegiance to Japan.  
</P>
<P>
 The few hundred who refused to join were nicknamed "no, no boys" by the 
Japanese American community because they answered no to the loyalty questions.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was upsetting that they were out fighting for freedom when we didn't have 
any back home," said Chiye Harada, 73. Even though she was upset about living 
in the prison-like conditions, Chiye Harada said she never felt that "it was a 
permanent situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Letters from the separated loved ones sustained them, Harada said. The play 
often uses letters to tell its story. "This is no adventure, this is hell," one 
soldier writes his family in a camp. "It's thinking of you guys that's getting 
me through." 
</P>
<P>
 During the war, Harada said, he and his wife shared emotions like that about 
once a week.  
</P>
<P>
 "One of the reasons the 100th Infantry Battalion and 442nd Regimental Combat 
Team was so valiant in combat was because they thought of their families who 
were incarcerated," Harada said. "They needed to prove by their daring feats 
that the government was wrong in incarcerating American citizens. They wanted 
to show their citizenship by making the supreme sacrifice so that the U.S. and 
all nations would be rid of bigotry, prejudice and discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
 Actor Darrell Kunitomi still reads the letters his uncle wrote from the front 
lines and said he uses them for inspiration as he plays two roles, that of a 
442nd soldier who agreed to join the U.S. Army and a "no, no boy" who refused.  
</P>
<P>
 "What they did is hard for somebody in the 1990s to grasp, especially for 
those born in the age of Vietnam and Watergate," Kunitomi said. 
</P>
<P>
 His 18-year-old uncle was killed in the fighting while his parents were 
interned at Heart Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 "They stepped out behind barbed wire and literally marched off to war and then 
engaged in some of the most ferocious fighting with unbelievable casualties," 
Kunitomi said. "That was an era when you believed in causes and you were 
willing to go out there and lose your lives over it."  
</P>
<P>
 That spirit has made the veterans icons in the Asian community. Many credit 
their bravery with influencing the eventual overturning of anti-Asian laws that 
until 1954 did not allow Japanese immigrants to become U.S. citizens. Their 
testimony before Congress in 1988 helped persuade the government to award those 
interned redress payments. 
</P>
<P>
 "War has no glory as far as I'm concerned," Harada said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the acceptance of not only Japanese Americans but all Asians after 
the war was better," he said. "It came about mainly because of those men who 
made the supreme sacrifice. But I believe the stoicism of those interned, the 
young as well as the old, (contributed) to the acceptance of Japanese 
Americans, and all the Americans."
