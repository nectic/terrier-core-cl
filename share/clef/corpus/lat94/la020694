 * It is interesting, and humorous, to see that Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen is becoming part of the U.S. contingent to browbeat Asian nations to 
open their markets more to U.S. products. He said Washington will seek "to open 
markets, not close ours" (Jan. 19). 
</P>
<P>
 This ridiculous strategy has been going on for more than 12 years, and has 
failed.  
</P>
<P>
 The answer is to close off our markets more, the same as Japan and most of the 
other Asian nations do. Especially in products where most of the deficit 
occurs, like automobiles and auto parts. This would show that our politicians 
really are serious, instead of just posturing.

 * It looks like the Clinton Adminsitration is greasing the skids for renewal 
of the "most favored nation" trade status for China regardless of its massive 
human rights and trade rights abuses, including the widespread use of slave 
labor to produce exports to the United States (Jan. 21). 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Ambassador J. Stapleton Roy at the end of December declared that he 
considers it "abnormal" to link China's trade status with its human rights 
abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, the U.S. Department of State's annual report of human rights fails to 
complain about the 20 million Chinese in the laogai forced labor system.  
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, Bentsen announced "some progress" toward making inspections of 
some laogai forced labor facilities. This "progress" amounted to only five 
sites.  
</P>
<P>
 With such diplomatic nonchalance, the Clinton Administration looks like it 
will accept tokenism instead of full compliance with human rights practices.

MARCHERS PLEAD FOR PEACE IN VIOLENT NEIGHBORHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Armed with green ribbons of neutrality, nearly 50 activists marched through 
one of Los Angeles' most violent neighborhoods on Saturday, but few hard-core 
gang members were on hand to heed their pleas for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 To shouts of "Black Power" and "Viva La Raza," the marchers wound their way 
through the streets of Venice's Oakwood district, where a fierce rivalry 
between black and Latino gangs has left 11 people dead and more than 30 wounded 
in the last four months. 
</P>
<P>
 The multiracial group -- which ranged from members of the Brown Berets to the 
Coalition Against Police Abuse to a Mayan spiritualist waving an incense burner 
-- called on the gangs to end their warfare and help rebuild a community that 
has been held virtually captive by reckless gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to let these guys know that the community supports the need for 
a truce," said Michael Zinzun, a longtime political activist. "That's why we're 
putting ourselves on the line right now." 
</P>
<P>
 But like Zinzun, many in the crowd were from outside the Venice area and 
appeared to be pushing social agendas that reached far beyond the question of a 
gang truce. That fact was not lost on Lupe Gonzalez, who watched from her front 
yard as the marchers chanted the names of their heroes -- Cesar Chavez, Malcolm 
X -- and ridiculed those they hold in low esteem -- the police and CIA. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids who should be out here are not out here," said Gonzalez, 48, whose 
home was sprayed with gunfire at Christmastime when an assailant spotted two 
former gang members helping paint the small stucco bungalow. "We don't need 
anyone to come into our community and tell us what our problem is." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's rally comes after months of violent clashes between a black gang in 
Oakwood and two Latino gangs, one in Venice and the other several miles to the 
east in the Mar Vista Gardens housing project. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, police say, most of the bloodshed in those neighborhoods stemmed 
from conflicts between the two Latino gangs. But after they forged a truce in 
1992, they began to war with the black gang, which had coexisted peacefully 
with them on the same turf. Investigators have linked the interracial rivalry 
to a battle being waged by prison gangs over control of the drug trade. 
</P>
<P>
 To help fight the violence, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office 
Friday announced a program designed to crack down on hard-core members of the 
three gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, Los Angeles police officers will notify prosecutors whenever a 
gang member from those neighborhoods is arrested. Prosecutors will advise 
judges, who will be asked to immediately sentence the suspects for probation 
violations, regardless of the crime for which they were arrested.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; APPELLATE COURT TO RULE IN PROJECT FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRIS YOKOI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Local activists continued their years-long battle against the Central City 
West development project last week by asking a state appeals court to rule that 
the city did not properly assess the project's traffic and other environmental 
impacts. 
</P>
<P>
 In arguments before the 2nd District Court of Appeal, an attorney for A Local 
And Regional Monitor (ALARM), a group of Echo Park, Temple-Beaudry and Elysian 
Park residents, contended that the city had a flawed General Plan to use as a 
guideline when it approved the Central City West development plan several years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other arguments, ALARM attorney Sabrina Schiller said that because the 
city's General Plan did not include a "public transportation" section, there is 
nothing that maps potential locations for transit stops or addresses how 
commuters and residents will get to and from the project area, which is west of 
the Harbor Freeway in the Temple-Beaudry community. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiller also argued that the sewer system plan the city has in place is 
outdated and does not address the impact of this development or future 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 She questioned how the city could approve the development project as 
consistent with the city's General Plan when the General Plan itself is 
incomplete, having been adopted and updated in bits and pieces. Because the 
city is now updating the General Plan again, Schiller said the Central City 
West project should be put on hold until the new plan is in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Development of Central City West has been slow to get off the ground because 
of the recession. One of the developers has considered selling its portion of 
the property to the Los Angeles Unified School District for a school site, 
which has triggered another community debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the city and the Central City West developers argued that ALARM 
has failed to show specifically what sections of their development plan do not 
comply with city guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 They also contended, as a Superior Court judge did in the 1992 decision siding 
with the city, that the General Plan merely provides guidelines that city 
officials can modify at their discretion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guidelines (mean) 'should,' 'we'd like to,' " said Kenneth Bley, attorney for 
Center City West Associates. "(City officials) were not required to be put in a 
straitjacket." 
</P>
<P>
 Justices Joan Dempsey Klein, Patti Kitching and H. Walter Croskey may take 
anywhere from a few days to several months to render their decision. IRIS YOKOI

OUT OF THE PARK; HARDBALL: A SEASON IN THE PROJECTS, BY DANIEL COYLE (PUTNAM: 
$22.95; 317 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Fred Schruers, Fred Schruers' last review in these pages was Thom Jones' The 
Pugilist at Rest. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hope, of course, is not only Emily Dickinson's "thing with feathers"; it can 
be the corniest of bywords, the endlessly repeated emblem of every social 
reformer and even the occasional presidential candidate. Our fatigue with the 
word is almost as great as our fatigue with the urban ills of violence and 
despair that hope is meant to do battle with. Yet the word could have been the 
title to this remarkable journal of a year with a Little League baseball team 
in a Chicago project. Could have been, that is, if author Daniel Coyle weren't 
so resolutely, resourcefully, unsentimental. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the spring of 1991," writes Coyle, a sometime editor at Outside Magazine, 
"I volunteered to coach in a new Little League being established at the 
Cabrini-Green housing project in Chicago." It's the following season, the 
summer of 1992, that Coyle chronicles "from first practice to last pitch." 
</P>
<P>
 You're probably thinking just what this reviewer was: Here comes the 
well-meaning procession of cliches showing do-gooders at work with good-hearted 
kids stuck in the inner city, finally ennobled by the great American game. 
Well, this story's small flock of young urban professional coaches are 
essentially do-gooders, the kids essentially good-hearted, and yes, redemption 
of a sort tags a ride on baseball. But Coyle's vital strategy here is to make 
use of his very acute ear, and what sticks with us are the angrily comic, 
street-burnished voices of the 9- to 12-year-olds the coaches just barely 
control. "Man!" yells the rebellious Jalen to head coach Bill during infield 
practice, "This phony ! When you gonna let us hit?" When he gets to the plate 
later, he's carrying a 34-inch wooden monster he's inscribed "Rude Dude"; it's 
two-thirds his height. "Those bats is buster bats," Jalen says, using a 
pejorative we'll often hear dismissing the team's equipment. As he finally 
swings late at a pitch, Coach Brad mutters to a colleague, "Is he batting or 
tossing the caber?" 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the book consists of canny eavesdropping on this sort of dialogue -- 
an anecdotal history of the coaches' long campaign to keep their charges in 
line and learning the game. Flare-ups and truces alternate in quick succession, 
and Coyle frequently traces the personality traits various players reveal in 
the (just a tad overlong) game sequences back to their home and family 
environments. These sections, employing the author's reliable knack for noting 
telling details, are brief but seldom simplistic. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the team's dozen-plus regulars lose their fathers in the course of 
the season. These street-talking, often sarcastic, cynical or cruel players are 
in fact still children, and Coyle seldom shows their bravado without some 
insight revealing the pain underneath. The remote Maurice "sometimes imagined 
that his father was not a skinny junkie, but someone else, a famous athlete, 
maybe, someone who would, when Maurice was a famous athlete himself, come 
forward and reveal the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Life promises little to these boys. When the author describes a neighborhood 
group of old men who drink wine outside the stable where the tourist-hauling 
carriage horses dwell, he is at his most effectively deadpan: "For a nickel and 
a bottle of Wild Irish, they said, they'd trade places. Three squares a day, 
afternoons hauling folks around the Gold Coast (a nearby wealthy enclave). 
Hispanic boys combing your back. It wouldn't be half-bad." 
</P>
<P>
 If the kids often rebuke their leaders, then scam them for free pizza as a 
reward for home runs, the coaches know it's partly due to their own temporary 
investment in the youngsters' lives. Coaches Bill and Brad and Cort and Kevin 
can (Eds: A federal judge today agreed to set $350,000 bail for a Valencia 
bodyguard, who was arrested last week with a cache of unregistered machine guns 
and explosives. Story coming.) drive off in their Jeeps and red Saabs one day, 
but the kids will remain on these streets where their friends "could imitate 
the reports of different guns like birdcalls." The team names neatly capture 
the societal gulf between the coaches and the players: the Morgan Stanley & Co. 
Mau Mau, the Merrill Lynch Watusi. We follow the First Chicago Near North 
Kikuyus and we get to know them well (no mention is made that the African tribe 
of that name were central to Isak Dinesen's "Out of Africa"). 
</P>
<P>
 There's been a good deal of chin-pulling over the years regarding what's 
called Black English, and if its constant use here doesn't offend the PC 
police, the view of the league's neighborhood organizer Al Carter threatens to. 
The compellingly passionate league spearhead, Bob Muzikowski, vies with Carter 
sporadically through the book's middle passages. At one stage he accuses him of 
misusing grant funds. We have just about cast Carter as the villain when Coyle, 
stepping in with typically thorough reportage, shows the man's history of 
encountering racism, and lets us see where his anger and sullenness almost 
certainly came from. He's not exonerated, but we at least understand him. 
</P>
<P>
 Coyle, interestingly, hides himself among the pseudonymous coaches. The book's 
story recounts a struggle, but not one man's struggle. It almost shouldn't 
matter that these Kikuyus emerge from incompetence to vie for the championship, 
and yet that ascent may be why Paramount Pictures has bought rights to 
"Hardball." After appreciating this book for its sharp observation, its 
unostentatious but neatly descriptive prose, its steady track past or even 
through all the possible cliches, one would hate to see it "punched up." The 
final game ends as a novelist, not a producer, would have things. We witness 
the team's actual triumph in the microcosm of Jalen and Coach Bill eyeing each 
other as the group chooses partners, pupil matching with tutor for a local 
youth center program. "Jalen hadn't been considered eagerly by anyone," Bill 
reflects. "Too much of a headache, one coach said. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Better to discover the rest on one's own. Suffice it to say that Coyle's 
vision of hope has been raised, by subtle accretion of incident and insight, 
into a very useful parable for urban America's would-be rescuers. One small 
group's patient, faltering trip toward real brotherhood has been shown, without 
tears or puffery. Eventually we see the coaches' cars, loaded with players 
after a post-game party, "heading south, back to the projects, and as they 
accelerated into the dark streets, a dozen small hands could be seen sticking 
out of the windows, trying to capture the air." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing phony about that, or about this book, which deserves recognition as a 
landmark for its times, in the place called urban America.

AN EAST-WEST AMBIVALENCE; IN EUROPE'S NAME: GERMANY AND THE DIVIDED CONTINENT, 
BY TIMOTHY GARTON ASH (RANDOM HOUSE: $27.50; 680 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Josef Joffe, Josef Joffe is columnist and editorial page editor of 
Suddeutsche Zeitung in Munich. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is an ambivalent book about an ambivalent subject: Germany and 
"Ostpolitik," its policy toward the East from the late '60s to the early '90s. 
A country that itself is the very epitome of ambivalence, Germany has found 
itself regularly pitted against the West, but it also fought Russia and Poland. 
In peace, it embraced Enlightenment as well as Romanticism, Western liberalism 
and Nazi totalitarianism. Frederick the Great of Prussia wrote French and 
lionized Voltaire, but that did not keep him from militarizing his society and 
fighting the entire neighborhood -- right, left and center. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Republic (formerly West Germany) was born as a child of the West, 
as progeny of Western strategy in the Cold War. But it was an uneasy youth. As 
soon as Konrad Adenauer, the founding father, had gained entry to NATO in 1955, 
he opened a diplomatic channel to Moscow. Hardly had the Berlin Wall gone up in 
1961, seemingly dividing Europe and East Germany forever, when Willy Brandt, 
the future chancellor, began drafting the New Ostpolitik. That policy would 
eventually position Bonn halfway between an alliance with the West and a 
separate detente with the East. Today, all of Germany is in the West, but in 
truth, the West is no more, and neither is the East. So where does that leave 
Germany? 
</P>
<P>
 "Troubled and burdened," Timothy Garton Ash concludes in this brilliantly 
written and researched analysis of East-West diplomacy. The "favorable variant" 
he had "imagined for Germany and Europe . . . did not seem probable." Yet, he 
concludes, "there are worse combinations than that of skepticism and hope." 
</P>
<P>
 "Skepticism and hope" -- another expression for ambivalence -- could almost 
serve as the motto for this book. While Ash, the Oxford scholar, may have liked 
to deliver hard and fast answers to the age-old question "Whence and whither 
Germany?," he has ended up writing in the manner of a New York Review of Books 
essay: learned and magisterial, but with a journalist's penchant for drama; 
reflective to the point of rumination, but with a fine eye for irony and 
imagery. 
</P>
<P>
 Ash's book is indeed an exciting tale and veritable gold mine of original 
information. In seven years of research, he gained access to the personal 
papers of chancellors Willy Brandt and Helmut Schmidt, of Foreign Minister 
Hans-Dietrich Genscher and Egon Bahr, Brandt's confidante and architect of the 
New Ostpolitik. Thanks to the collapse of East Germany, Ash could also tap into 
minutes of the Politburo, Central Committee records and files of the Stasi, the 
East German secret police. 
</P>
<P>
 Ash lets them all speak for themselves, copiously and patiently. But what did 
all those leaders really want? Did they, as Brandt put it, really "accept the 
results of history" and their definitive attachment to the West? Or did they -- 
slowly and craftily -- actually seek to subvert the postwar order by pushing 
Russians and Americans out of the European center in the name of disengagement 
and disarmament? 
</P>
<P>
 Did West German leaders speak "in Europe's name," all the while pursuing 
coldblooded national interests? Or was Helmut Schmidt, chancellor from 1974 to 
1982, merely acting as "honest interpreter" for the West when he ventured to 
Moscow a few months after the Afghanistan invasion? "Plain speaking," Ash 
notes, "was not Bonn's forte. Waffle was." 
</P>
<P>
 Here, too, Ash the journalist as historian is the master of ambivalence, and 
perhaps rightly so. He puts the problem well on Page 2. It is the difficulty of 
"distinguishing between what people said in public, what they said or merely 
thought in private, and, not least, what they think or say now that they 
thought or said then." Let this sink in, and you'll understand the perils of 
contemporary history. 
</P>
<P>
 Sorting out reasons and rationalizations, which Ash does with a sharp eye for 
posturing and obfuscation, becomes even more difficult when, in the middle of 
it all, history suddenly overturns the gaming board. "Whither Ostpolitik?" 
became a moot question on Nov. 9, 1989, when East Germany began to collapse. 
Less than a year later, Germany was reunified; by Christmas Day, 1991, the 
Soviet Union was no more. Suddenly, Bahr's schemes or Genscher's 
circumlocutions no longer mattered. It was as if they had worked away at 
needlepoint when, in a twist of cunning, history hit them with the whole 
textile factory. 
</P>
<P>
 Ash, in his cautious and subtle way, does leave us with some lessons worth 
pondering. For one, he faults Ostpolitik for its excessive, coldhearted 
realism. For all its pieties (which Ash deftly skewers), Ostpolitik, especially 
in its Social Democratic variant from 1969 to 1982, came very close to 
betraying the very values it purported to uphold. Rather than saying so 
himself, Ash lets Vaclav Havel -- the Czech writer and dissident who would 
become President -- speak: "Ostpolitik . . . managed at times to be well and 
truly ambiguous. . . . It signified, of course, the first glimmer of hope for a 
Europe without Cold War. . . ; yet at the same time -- alas -- it more than 
once signified the renunciation of freedom, and hence of a basic condition for 
any real peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Did Ostpolitik and detente really kill them with kindness? There was certainly 
plenty of "reassurance," but very little "relaxation." In the end, it was not 
Bonn's latter-day Metternichs but Solidarity and the people gathering by the 
hundreds of thousands in Leipzig that forced liberty from the tightfisted hands 
of the Communist regimes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Ash's book has become a munitions dump from which the left 
and the right draw freely to snipe away at each other again. Social Democrats 
see "In Europe's Name" as proof consummate that they had always been right: It 
was Ostpolitik and detente that softened up the Soviet Empire. Further to the 
right, politicos and publicists point instead to Reagan, SDI and the 
"Euromissiles" -- the West had simply arms-raced the East to death. 
</P>
<P>
 To use the book so brazenly as Exhibit X for both sides does Ash wrong. His 
forte is not the battle-ax but the thin-bladed rapier, always poised to pierce 
cant and to slash pretense. And he is too scrupulous -- and too subtle -- a 
historian to hawk a simple message. Was it Brandt-Bahr-Genscher or 
Reagan-Perle-Baker who undid the Soviet Union? Let Ash respond: "The first 
answer is: both. The second is: neither."

 In the tropical sun on Rio de Janeiro's Copacabana "the beach felt blinding." 
Down from the hillside slums, Tristao and his half-brother Euclides are on 
their daily scavenge for purses and other opportunities. The two black youths 
spot the well-born Isabel, blond and fair-skinned, in her pale bikini. "This 
dolly, I think she was made for me," Tristao exclaims. 
</P>
<P>
 He takes off a ring inscribed "DAR" -- it means give in Portuguese but in fact 
it was extracted by razor from a visiting blue-rinsed Daughter of the American 
Revolution -- and presents it to Isabel "because you are beautiful and, what is 
rarer, not ashamed of your beauty." Instead of uttering the Portuguese 
equivalent of "eek!," Isabel comes back equally high-flown. "It is dangerous to 
be beautiful -- that is how women have learned shame," she tells him. Before 
long they are off to her uncle's luxurious apartment so that she can lose her 
virginity. Tristao soothes her initial nervousness: "My advice is to let 
yourself sink to the point where my pleasure and yours are the same." 
</P>
<P>
 If it were not for the book-jacket or title-page, a reader would hardly guess 
that these opening pages of "Brazil" were by John Updike. Their diction is 
opera in an uncertain translation. Updike's Massachusetts beaches might dazzle 
but they would never feel blinding. His sex always has a worm of fleshly 
itching in it; in this new novel, though far more extravagant and detailed, sex 
is almost wholly gestural. It makes the earth move while Tristao and Isabel, on 
the other hand, barely wiggle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brazil" is Updike's only entirely foreign novel since "The Coup." It is very 
foreign indeed; much more than if a Brazilian had written it, since the 
Brazilian would be writing of his or her own world and, in the case of a great 
writer -- Updike cites Machado de Assis and Clarice Lispector as two of his 
models -- we would feel part of that world. In "Brazil," despite its moments of 
charm and several risky accomplishments, we are tourists, unsure about the 
water and whether the half-caught phrase is an endearment or the offer of a 
stolen watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Updike navigates between romantic fantasy and sardonic allegory in tones that 
shift from the operatic style of some of the speeches to moments of comic 
realism. Despite the names of the protagonists, it is not quite "Tristan and 
Iseult," although its lovers are, to some extent, star-crossed. As they 
discover their fates in each other, flee her powerful family's wrath and 
adventure across the Brazilian wilderness, their recitatives take a 
Puccini-like turn; as in "The Girl of the Golden West," perhaps. 
</P>
<P>
 Updike makes the eloping of the young pair a parable for the union of Brazil's 
extremes: its vastly rich light-skinned ruling class, and its mixed-race and 
native South American multitudes. It is quite as stormy and unlikely as such a 
union would be, with extravagant incident, a touch or two of magic and a dour, 
ironic ending. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple goes first to Sao Paulo to take shelter with Tristao's brother, who 
has made his way up from the slums to work in a car factory. Her father, a 
powerful diplomat who lives in Brasilia, sends a gunman to get her back, under 
the threat of killing not only Tristao but his family as well. The gunman is an 
amiable villain, worthy of Graham Greene. "He hoped, when his days as an 
assassin and an enforcer were over . . . to buy his own limousine and become a 
tour guide." 
</P>
<P>
 While Tristao stays in Sao Paulo, Isabel spends the next two years at the 
university under the chilly eye of a father whose kiss was "tinged, like 
luggage stored in the unheated hold of an airplane, with the extra-terrestrial 
cold of the stratosphere." She distracts herself by sleeping with an assortment 
of fellow-students until Tristao turns up again and they flee into the 
interior. 
</P>
<P>
 They buy a gold-mining claim and spend several years scrabbling in a poverty 
relieved only by Isabel's employment in the local brothel, which produces food 
and two children. When the family gunman tracks them down, they dispose of him 
and flee into the jungle. Native South Americans make off with the children; 
they struggle on, starving and near death until they fall prisoner to a crazed 
band of half-white settlers who keep native South Americans as slaves and 
believe that Brazil is still ruled by an emperor. Their chief takes Isabel as 
his third wife and makes Tristao a slave. 
</P>
<P>
 Isabel sets out on her own trek to a shaman in the foothills of the Andes; 
they hit it off, and he grants her wish: to make it possible for Tristao to 
join the country's ruling class so they can go home. By long-distance magic he 
turns Tristao white. Since magic is a zero-sum game, however, Isabel turns 
black. After further adventures, they make their way back to Brasilia. Isabel's 
father is too starchily correct to mention her color, and since Tristao is now 
white he can be promoted into the upper classes. The years go by comfortably, 
boringly, depressingly until a mugging claims Tristao as the ironic victim of 
his new white skin. Isabel's heart is broken but it goes on beating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brazil" is something of a mess, if at times an interesting one. Updike tries 
to make Tristao and Isabel both symbols and personages, but the two elements 
don't bond very well. We assume that Isabel's compulsive infidelity and her 
ability to conceive children with everyone except Tristao says something gloomy 
about the unbridgeable divisions of the society. She takes the practical lead 
but worships him like a sexual fetish -- so long as he is black and she is 
white. When the colors are reversed, he more or less takes charge of their 
lives but his primal energy recedes into a neurotic brooding, while Isabel 
turns earthy and her erotic adoration gives way to a matter-of-fact 
raunchiness. Whatever the color, it is class that counts; Isabel will 
ultimately be the one not to end up as victim. 
</P>
<P>
 The symbolic meaning of all this is more or less apparent though faintly 
distasteful, if only because it has the whiff and presumption of cultural 
tourism. More seriously it tends to muddy the incipient allure that Tristao and 
Isabel possess as characters. The book is stronger in Updike's sense of place 
than his sense of people. The contrasts between Rio, Sao Paulo and Brasilia are 
vividly rendered; so are the feel and the sights of a rickety bus journey 
through the red dirt and derelict towns of the interior. In taking an artistic 
sensibility abroad, a country is more accessible than its countrymen. Visitors 
commune more easily with Paris than with Parisians. 
</P>
<P>
 The impulse to travel consists, in varying proportions, of the need to leave 
somewhere and the need to go somewhere. With Rabbit dead, and Updike's other 
American themes so thoroughly and finely worked through, "Brazil" may indeed 
reflect an urge for departure. He has not quite made an arrival.

A FATHER'S LAMENT; CROSSING THE RIVER, BY CARYL PHILLIPS (ALFRED A. KNOPF: $22; 
237 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Veronica Chambers, Veronica Chambers is writing a family memoir about 
African-American mothers and daughters. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the very first lines of Caryl Phillips' "Crossing the River," there is 
remorse. "A desperate foolishness. The crops failed. I sold my children." 
Starting with the late 18th Century, when an African man sells his children 
(two boys, one girl) into slavery, Phillips takes our hand and guides us 
through their three disparate lives -- one becomes a missionary in Liberia, one 
pioneers across the American West, another becomes an American GI in Europe. 
Their father, in person and then in spirit, is our anchor to the African shore. 
For 250 years he waits for the children to cross back over "the river" that has 
taken them into a lifetime of struggle and bondage: "A desperate foolishness. 
The crops failed. I sold my children." 
</P>
<P>
 The novel is slim, and the story of each child is whittled like wood to its 
shapeliest essence. The stories each take place in a different time, making it 
impossible really, for the characters to have been brothers and sisters: Nash 
is a missionary in the 1830s, Martha ventures west in the late 1800s, and 
Travis fights in World War II. Suspend logic and Phillips's web is so appealing 
that one doesn't question dates and times. Like Isabel Allende and Gabriel 
Garcia Marquez, he writes of times so heady and chaotic and of characters so 
compelling that time moves as if guided by the moon and dreams, not by any 
clock or calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 Nash, the oldest son, is purchased by a man named Edward Williams. Edward is 
heir to a slaveholding fortune; a fervent Christian, he seeks to liberate 
himself of this blot on his conscience before he meets his maker. Thus Edward's 
involvement in the "American Colonization Society," a group of wealthy white 
Americans who help to send slaves back to Africa. Unsure of the slaves' origins 
and well aware that the Americanized blacks are no longer "natives," they are 
sent to Liberia, the West African nation formed by free slaves. For Edward, it 
is the perfect solution: 
</P>
<P>
 "Not that the American Colonization Society was ignorant of the dangers that 
would accompany their policy to attempting to repatriate former slaves on the 
west coast of Africa. This was, after all, a continent belonging to the native 
African and to nobody else. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the American Colonization Society was sure that the benefits would accrue 
to both nations. America would be removing a cause of increasing social stress, 
and Africa would be civilized by the return of their descendants who were now 
blessed with rational Christian minds." 
</P>
<P>
 It is only when Edward sends off his favorite ex-slave, Nash Williams, that he 
begins to realize how attached he is to the black man who calls him "Father." 
When, seven years into his missionary stay, Nash disappears into "the Dark 
Continent" and cuts off all contact, Edward heads off to Africa. It is there 
that Edward realizes how deeply linked he is to Nash and to all blacks in 
general -- that his definition of being "white" is dependent on a corollary 
definition of being "black." 
</P>
<P>
 Martha, the daughter, has already lost a husband and a child to the auction 
block when she decides to head west. With only a card from a friend who is 
happy and free in San Francisco, Martha heads out to make the difficult journey 
from the slave territories to the free land.Through her, we see and feel the 
desperate hope that led so many blacks to follow the hard trails of the 
pioneers. By the time we meet Martha, she is already an old woman and well 
aware that she might not make it to the "Promised Land." No matter: 
</P>
<P>
 "That night, Martha packed her bundle and left the house. For where, she was 
not sure (don't care where), being concerned with only heading west (going 
west), away from the big river (away from Hell) and avoiding . . . traders who 
would gladly sell her back over the border and into Missouri. The dark night 
spread before her, but behind the drifting clouds she knew the sky was heavy 
with stars (feeling good). Never again would she stand on an auction block. 
(Never.) Never again would she be renamed. (Never.) Never again would she 
belong to anybody. (No sir, never.) Martha looked over her shoulders as she 
ran. (Like the wind, girl.)" 
</P>
<P>
 For Travis, the youngest son, an American GI, love and hope comes in the arm 
of a white English girl. She is uneducated, orphaned by the war and running 
from a husband who beats her. She knows that Travis is "coloured" and that is a 
problem in 1943, but she wishes she could explain to him that she was an 
outcast before he ever came into her life. What matters most to her is that 
Travis is an American, and in wartime that means plenty: 
</P>
<P>
 "At the end of the dance we all left together, so there was no question of 
anyone walking out with anyone. They brought us our coats, and gave us 
presents. An orange, a pack of cigarettes and some candy, as they call it. 
Chocolate is what we call it, and for most of us it was like being given lumps 
of gold. The Yanks really have no idea of what it means. I think we were maybe 
a little bit rude, like kids, for once they'd given us the chocolate we all 
muttered a hasty good night. Everybody just wanted to escape with the chocolate 
in case the Yanks changed their minds. The next morning, I woke up and thought 
about him." 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance "Crossing the River" (which was short-listed for England's 
prestigious Booker Prize) seems to be a historical novel about slavery. But as 
one goes through each of the novel's four slim chapters, it becomes clear that 
this is not so much a book about slavery as it is a book about where slavery 
has taken us. It led Martha West and Travis to Europe. It led Nash back across 
the river -- and for his sake, Edward Williams crossed the river as well. 
Neither can one forget the father, who waits 250 years by the riverside for his 
children's return. "Crossing the River" is also a novel about parenting, about 
bad decisions and remorse: "A desperate foolishness. The crops failed. I sold 
my children."

WOMEN, MONEY AND POWER; THE AUTHOR OF "FIRE WITH FIRE" CHARGES THAT THE LEFT'S 
AVERSION TO MONEY MATTERS IS HOLDING FEMINISM BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NAOMI WOLF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In my book, "Fire With Fire," I show that we women, collectively, have our 
hands on enough political tools to begin to pry open the gates of power. We are 
51% of the population, 53% of the electorate; we have 7 million to 12 million 
more votes than men, and we've been outvoting men since 1980. We spend 85% of 
the consumer dollar, 51% of the charity dollar and most of the tuition dollar. 
If we wake up to our own power and learn to use it far more combatively, we 
will secure social equality by the dawn of the coming century. 
</P>
<P>
 Paradoxically, what stands in our way at this moment of opportunity are 
precisely the reflexes left over from a feminism articulated by the Marxist 
left of the 1960s. That revolution taught that women's true liberation would to 
be secured by shunning the tools of an evil capitalist patriarchy. It urged 
withdrawing from any engagement with the market economy, even in the interest 
of creating social justice. The revolutionaries' favorite slogan was the poet 
Audre Lorde's dictum: "The master's tools will never dismantle the master's 
house." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, my call for women to acquire money and thereby power has 
brought me into conflict with the left. Robert Scheer's attack on my book in 
the Los Angeles Times Book Review (Dec. 19) exemplifies just these attitudes 
that are holding feminism back. Scheer's spleen stems from the misguided 
premise, a commonplace in the elite left, that when someone is talking about 
using money and power to advance social equality, he or she must only be 
addressing those with money and power. 
</P>
<P>
 "How does urging women to vote their interests have relevance for a welfare 
mother in Harlem?" I am often asked sneeringly by white, middle-class 
"radicals" on college campuses. "How can you talk about economic literacy if 
most women are struggling just to get by?" Scheer worries that my call for 
women to achieve their potential status as a "new ruling class" speaks to and 
for only those women affluent enough to finance candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 All these objections accuse me of elitism. But my theories about money, power 
and the franchise, and how women should use them, descend directly from earlier 
progressive movements. Realizing that the dominant class never gives up power 
simply because it is the right thing to do, the leaders of the civil rights 
movement called upon their followers -- made up, of course, mostly of the 
poorest and most dispossessed -- to seize the tools of power that alone could 
force open the gates. Scheer's suggestion that only women rich enough to 
finance candidates are interested in politics reveals, to my mind, 
paternalistic attitudes toward the disenfranchised that betray the 
progressivism set forth by civil rights leaders from Gandhi to the Rev. Martin 
Luther King Jr. and the Rev. Jesse Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 King would be appalled by the idea the poor were somehow beneath an appeal to 
voter mobilization in their interest. The Rev. Jesse Jackson does not imagine 
that his poor and working-class audiences are incapable of understanding 
allusive language or engaging in complex political debate. Many progressive 
leaders have urged a marriage of government help and community self-help: "You 
are not responsible for being down," Jackson says. "You are responsible for 
standing up." 
</P>
<P>
 Other progressives have urged using the marketplace: Malcolm X spearheaded 
"Buy Black" campaigns, and today some of the most committed civil rights 
leaders are promoting urban-area public-private partnerships. The 1930s radical 
Saul Alinsky advocated what he called "proxies for people," a scheme in which 
poor communities bought stock and thus forced corporations to address their 
needs. None of these radicals needed to be convinced of the urgency of 
mobilizing around economic empowerment. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the relationship between money and social justice has always been 
recognized in progressive politics. So what's the problem with women and money? 
Would Scheer balk so at a manifesto urging economic empowerment for, say, Hmong 
immigrants? The hostility provoked by my discussion of female economic 
empowerment betrays a deep, unconscious and immensely pervasive fear -- shared 
by women as well as men, by the right as well as the left -- of what would 
actually happen if women had as much money as men. The specter of the 
economically independent woman strikes a primal anxiety in the collective 
unconscious. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of us were raised by economically dependent mothers. On a subliminal 
level, we may fear that if women were economically independent, they might not 
perform the care-taking and nurturing functions of the world. If Mother had 
money, she might not be there for us; she might be dancing all night at the 
Ritz. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do I believe that it is so important for feminism to get over its Angel in 
the House, middle-class-lady queasiness around the issue of women and money? 
The answer comes out of my own training as a Marxist: To understand power 
relations, follow the money. It is not misogyny, or law, or child rearing, that 
make women most vulnerable to sexism; it is their poverty relative to men. 
</P>
<P>
 I too grew up as a baby of the counterculture; I too found my longing for a 
better world sloganized alluringly in the language of the anti-capitalist left; 
I too am a recovering Marxist. But three developments changed my assumptions, 
and led me to the belief that it is only the master's tools that will dismantle 
the master's house, and that the next stage of women's empowerment depends upon 
their learning to use the potent weapon of money: 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- The Berlin Wall fell in 1989. It does not make sense for the last living 
unself-critical Marxists to be middle-class American academic feminists (and 
Cubans!). We on the left need a new eschatological punch line, and it seems 
obvious to me that those of us who care about social justice need to wake up to 
this reality and commit ourselves to engaging with the economy that exists if 
we are to empower the dispossessed. 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- I traveled around the country, meeting audiences that consisted both of 
academic feminist "radicals" and the women who make up the demographic 
majority: those who are supporting kids on an average salary of $16,000 a year. 
These elite audiences were, like Robert Scheer, appalled at my indelicate, 
unfashionable insistence that feminism must teach economic literacy to all 
women, and embrace mastery of the marketplace in the interest of attaining 
equality. 
</P>
<P>
 But with audiences of women outside college campuses who make up the majority 
-- women in the pink-collar ghetto, in blue-collar jobs, in the service 
industry -- the same message was met with cheers. When polled by Redbook and 
the Ms. Foundation, working- and lower-middle-to-middle-class women say 
categorically that what they need most as women is -- surprise! -- more money. 
</P>
<P>
 The elite, leftist, feminist community's distaste for the issue of money shows 
they've wandered into an ideological cul de sac, in which the protection of 
their own purity has supplanted the true goal of progressive politics: 
alleviating suffering. As Bill Clinton said to the left wing of his party at 
the Democratic Leadership Council, "Beware letting the perfect stand in the way 
of the good." 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- I listened to women all around the country talk about money, and 
discovered that financial illiteracy debilitates women of all classes: the 
working-class women who think it unfeminine to negotiate for a raise; the 
middle-class women who feel safer in the lower-paying humanities than the 
higher-paying sciences, and who think of money as "polluting" and "immoral"; 
the upper-class women who never learn about their resources until a divorce 
sends their standard of living ricocheting downward, and they find that male 
relatives have taken over the management of family wealth. I met women of all 
classes who stay in abusive relationships because they can't afford to get out. 
</P>
<P>
 For all of these women, I wrote the sections on money and power in "Fire With 
Fire" that so offend some members of the traditional feminist and male left. 
</P>
<P>
 We may not be able to bring about a world free of misogyny, but with economic 
parity, women will inhabit a world in which sexists may have the same old 
impulses -- but can't afford to act on them.

THE WAR ON DRUGS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Don Bartletti's photographs and Alan Weisman's story ("The Drug Lords Vs. the 
Tarahumara," Jan. 9) were compelling -- and they also support rethinking the 
ravaging problem of drugs. Yes, let's legalize 'em, regulate 'em and tax the 
bejesus out of 'em.The Tarahumaras will get their land, and their peace back, 
and so too might America's cities.

 What is happening to the Tarahumara Indians is the result of the U.S. drug 
policy. The drug war is no more successful than Prohibition was, and the 
anti-drug laws are as out-of-date as the anti-abortion laws in place in some 
states. Control of my body and what I do to it should be a constitutional 
right.

 Weisman's piece notes that advocates of drug legalization, while citing the 
example of Holland, say that decriminalization does not cause a surge in 
addiction, any more than ending Prohibition increased alcoholism. Having 
watched the repeal of the Volsted Act, I question this. The rise in consumption 
of alcohol and its abuse, and the misery and tragedy that followed the repeal, 
have been so obvious that I wonder how anyone can make such a declaration.

COVER STORY: 'SUNDAY MORNING'S' RISE AND SHINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK MATHEWS, Jack Mathews is film critic for New York Newsday. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Considering how much of the world travels through it every week, and the 
number of people and ideas and arts its loyal viewers have met there over the 
years, the set of CBS' "Sunday Morning" is a surprisingly simple thing. A 
carpeted, two-tiered platform riser, framed at various angles by movable 
plexiglass partitions bearing the day's headlines and topics and, somewhere in 
its midst, an easel and a chair ... and Charles Kuralt. 
</P>
<P>
 On this particular Sunday morning, with New York in the early grip of the 
Great Freeze of '94, the set inside CBS' West 57th Street studios is busier 
than usual. The show, launched on Jan. 28, 1979, as a "Sunday newspaper in a 
tube," is about to celebrate its 15th anniversary, and many of its current cast 
of critics and reporters are assembling for a promotional photo. 
</P>
<P>
 There is Eugenia Zukerman and Billy Taylor, who have introduced so many 
talents in the worlds of classical music and jazz. And Bill Geist, the droll 
commentator who finds the most eccentric people in America and treats them as 
if they were absolutely ordinary. Hobbling around on an ankle twisted in an icy 
fall outside his Manhattan apartment is John Leonard, the media critic whom 
Kuralt describes as the "office intellectual." And there's Roger Welch, the 
Plains philosopher who files those "Postcards From Nebraska." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time these people have been in the same room together," 
says Kuralt, who greets each one as if he were a proud uncle hosting a family 
get-together, which, to use a phrase that slips frequently from his own lips, 
seems about right. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sunday Morning" is a unique creature in the jungle of network news, a 
throwback of sorts to a time when words were as important as images, and when 
personality and point of view ranked at least as high on the list of job 
qualifications as hairstyle and the ability to read off a TelePrompTer. 
</P>
<P>
 The show has followed virtually the same format since its inception, with 
brief recaps of the news, weather and sports, followed by a cover story that 
may take eight to 10 minutes to tell and a variety of what media insiders refer 
to as "back-of-the-book" pieces: profiles of up-and-coming people in the arts, 
eloquent tributes to those who've been around a while, whimsical features from 
the hinterlands and a well-written review or two. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the last refuge of prose in television news," says Leonard, a former New 
York Times columnist whose on-air style has been likened by one observer to 
that of "a raccoon caught in the glare of headlights." 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard used to worry about his electronic presence, but no longer. His smart, 
wryly acerbic commentaries blend right in on a program that has written its own 
stylebook. After all, this is a show that for 15 years, without fail, has 
concluded with a two-minute visual essay on nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Those bucolic "end-pieces" can be anything from wheat stalks bending with the 
wind to gentle manatees lulling beneath the surface of a Gulf Coast pond, which 
is the subject of this show's closing. And they are stretches of silence that 
the estimated 3 million viewers find as soothing as a mantra. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have suggested that we put out a video of the end-pieces," Kuralt 
says. "But I think two minutes is about right." 
</P>
<P>
 "'Sunday Morning' is more spiritual than almost anything else you see on 
television," says ABC media critic Jeff Greenfield, who had Leonard's job when 
the program began. "People don't simply like the show, they worship it." 
</P>
<P>
 Talk to anyone who has worked on "Sunday Morning" and they will likely tell 
you it is Kuralt the fans worship. They know his personality from 20 years of 
friendly "On the Road" stories, and his smoke-cured Carolina drawl is as 
comfortable as the slippers on their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't ask me what it's like being on the show," says Zukerman, who's 
been on it from the beginning. "They want to know if Charles Kuralt is really 
as nice as he seems." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuralt blanches at any suggestion that the show is him. Sitting in a chair in 
the hallway outside the sound stage, chain-smoking Pall Malls and allowing the 
ashes to fall between his feet, he credits Shad Northshield, "Sunday Morning's" 
first producer, with designing it and sending it on its way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shad really did have the concept for what the show should be, and it was 
brilliant," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Northshield, now producing shows out of CBS' news archives, declines the 
credit, too. He says then-CBS President Bill Leonard came to him in mid-1978 
with the idea of installing a 90-minute news show in place of three half-hour 
Sunday morning programs that were not producing advertising revenue for the 
network or the affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he wanted a show that would be the television equivalent of a Sunday 
newspaper," Northshield recalls. "I jumped on that and said, 'We can do a lot 
more art things,' and he said, 'Fine.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back over the first 15 years of "Sunday Morning," Kuralt mentions as 
highlights the shows devoted to Pablo Picasso and to Vladimir Horowitz' 
triumphant return to Moscow, and recalls a potent essay they did on the tragedy 
of the violence in Northern Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day they buried Lord Mountbatten, who had been killed in an IRA attack in 
England, they also buried a Catholic kid who had been killed in a Protestant 
attack in Ireland," he says. "It was a mean, cold day, a handful of mourners on 
a bleak hillside in Ireland, contrasting with Westminster Cathedral and the 
panoply of a royal funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they said a lot of the same words. Some of the prayers were the same, 
some of the songs were the same. It told the story of the pain of Ireland 
eloquently without any words being spoken by us. It went on and on, and it just 
made you want to cry. That kind of story we have a chance to do." 
</P>
<P>
 They also have the chance, in what Kuralt refers to as "this comparative 
backwater we're in," to do pieces like the one on the Vermont Symphony 
Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 "The orchestra had decided that in one season they were going to play concerts 
in every county in Vermont," Kuralt says. "We sent a camera crew along for much 
of the trip and it was just terrific. This caravan of cars going through the 
snow and ice to play a concert in a high school gym somewhere. It reminded you 
that it's not just the Metropolitan Museum and Lincoln Center -- the arts are 
alive everywhere in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuralt, 59, still goes on the road occasionally for "Sunday Morning," but he 
admits he gets tired of traveling now. He's been on the road, and in the air, 
since he was 25, hosting a CBS show called "Eyewitness to History." 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember going to Laos one week, then to Japan the next, and back to 
Vietnam, and doing the show in New York between each trip. Around the world 
three times in three weeks. I couldn't do that now." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuralt also spent several years as CBS' lone Latin American correspondent, 
living in Rio de Janeiro but spending most of his time in such far-flung places 
as Peru, Cuba and Guatemala. During the '60s, he covered stories in the Mideast 
and Southeast Asia, and says he was standing on a street outside Saigon when a 
bullet whizzed past and killed the young Vietnamese officer he was talking to. 
</P>
<P>
 Such close calls and a general insecurity about his hard news-reporting skills 
convinced Kuralt that maybe he ought to concentrate on the kind of people story 
that brought him to CBS's attention in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have the instincts of Mike Wallace or Dan Rather," he says. "I always 
kind of hated asking embarrassing questions and sticking my nose in where it 
wasn't wanted, all the things good reporters have to do every day." 
</P>
<P>
 When he began his "On the Road" series for CBS, crisscrossing the country with 
a camera crew and a motor home searching for stories most hard news reporters 
would walk past, he found them, everywhere, "endlessly rich, fascinating 
material, people doing amazing things." 
</P>
<P>
 "To this day, I am never more than 50 miles from a cup of coffee with someone 
we've done a story on," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuralt doesn't like to get too far from those stories, which is why he has 
former New York Times columnist Bill Geist ("one of the best feature writers 
I'd ever read") scouring the country, and Roger Welch and Tim Sample filing 
"postcards" from small towns in Maine and Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since so much of television comes from New York and Washington and Hollywood, 
it seems to me these are exactly the kinds of things we should be doing," 
Kuralt says. "I'd like to have three or four of them on the show. I've always 
dreamed of having Molly Ivins do 'Postcards From Texas.' " 
</P>
<P>
 If Kuralt doesn't have the instincts of a hard news reporter -- and he seems 
to almost stammer on those occasions when a breaking news story forces him to 
do live interviews -- it doesn't concern his fans. His reluctance to bore in on 
an interview subject, to not stick his nose in where it isn't wanted, is part 
of his charm. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ambush interview with Kuralt," laughs Greenfield. "No, Charles is much 
more in the world of E.B. White. Audiences sense that they are with a gentle 
spirit, absolutely." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a very clear idea of our audience," Kuralt says. "I used to 
think when we started it was some kind of intellectual audience, but I know 
it's not. Because so many cops on the beat, or skycaps at the airport, or 
people I meet on the airplane say, 'We never miss that show at our house.' 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a small audience, I guess, but it's a very grateful one." 
</P>
<P>
 What the audience has to be grateful for, says Greenfield, is that here is an 
"oasis" in television news where, at a leisurely Sunday morning pace, "nobody 
is shouting at you and nobody is pontificating." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Freundlich, the show's writer for the last eight years, was inspired to 
put it another way. While watching the manatee rolling laconically underwater 
on a monitor at the end of the show, he turned to a guest and said, "It just 
occurred to me, 'Sunday Morning' is the manatee of network news." 
</P>
<P>
 Kuralt lets out a deep laugh when that is repeated to him later. "I guess 
that's about right," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sunday Morning" airs at 7:30 a.m. on CBS.

 Peter Levitt's powerful and evocative "The Fires Within" (Jan. 9) is a 
masterpiece. I am probably as stereotypical a WASP as you could imagine, and I 
was deeply moved by Levitt's insightful description of his emotions during his 
trip to the Mauthausen concentration camp. The author helped us all to stand in 
his shoes, to feel his pain and gain a more compassionate understanding of it.

 The way in which Levitt observed beauty and terror in the same instance has to 
be one of the most frightening perceptions that we are capable of. For me, it 
was hearing the old man in the Munich train station say, "Sie haben Judische 
Augen" ("You have Jewish eyes."). I was awe-struck in realizing that everyone 
of his generation had some affiliation with the Nazis. Levitt was able to 
convey that the ongoing anti-Semitism must stop, as must the violence in our 
cities, a violence that we must be aware stems from within all of us.

 Levitt says that we must grieve for the victims of the Holocaust, and "do all 
we can to resist the tyranny of hatred and ignorance. . . we must look deeply 
within ourselves for the causes of such ignorance and its extension into 
action. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 The Holocaust was not a product of ignorance; it was planned and organized by 
the German intellectual and professional elite. And it was not simply the 
result of hatred; it was the result of a cool and deliberate decision to 
terminate the Jewish people. 
</P>
<P>
 The value of human life was negated and denied in Nazi Germany. And the fact 
that this concept is again present in our own time, in all too many lands, is 
one of the greatest dangers facing those of us who would like to live in a 
civilized world.

 The intellectual and behavioral problem of the Holocaust is not why it should 
not have happened but why it did. That little was learned about the nature and 
practices of racism is all too evident from the history of the last 45 years.

 As the wife of an Iranian Muslim, I have been given stony stares when asked 
the origin of my last name. I listened as a customer berated my brother-in-law, 
the owner of a gas station, as being another "dirty camel jockey." I cringed 
when my bilingual child said he was tired of hearing those "Mexican kids always 
talking that silly language." 
</P>
<P>
 The forces of prejudice are, along with so many other evil practices, growing 
at present stronger in the darkness surrounding humanity. Only the recognition 
of the oneness of mankind will save us.

 "Greetings From LovelinessLand" (by Margo Kaufman, Jan. 9) left me miffed and 
embarrassed about the perceived state of hairdressing in Los Angeles. At all of 
our Allen Edwards Salons, we teach our customers to be independent and 
cost-conscious about their hair and beauty routines. Only a tiny fraction of 
the city's population can spend hundreds on looking good.

 THE MAN FROM JAPAN by Clive James (Random House: $19; 173 pp.) Humorous 
novels, even the most effective ones, will generally cause people to read a 
passage and say to themselves, "Ha-ha.That's funny." Perhaps they'll give a 
little smile. However, "The Man From Japan," by English writer and television 
personality Clive James, is the rare kind of book, that, instead of a polite 
grin, inspires loud raucous laughter. Whole paragraphs can be read twice just 
for the pleasure of laughing again. 
</P>
<P>
 Akira Suzuki is an ambitious but traditional Japanese man living in London. 
Jane Austen is an overweight punk rocker, drug addict whose only dependable 
quality is that she will behave with stunning inappropriateness in every 
possible situation. When this unlikely couple get together the result is 
hilarious. Japanese, Westerners, media, yuppies, sex and language all get 
skewered with equal amounts of intelligence and wit. Miraculously, none of this 
is mean-spirited, even when James pokes fun at the character of Jane Austen, an 
obviously tragic, disturbed person. 
</P>
<P>
 A more subtle pleasure of "The Man From Japan" comes from the questions James 
seems to be asking. Who are we as a culture? How much of that is media? What 
can we do to teach and strengthen younger people? These complex issues are 
always present yet never pushed, giving an underpinning of seriousness to a 
basically lighthearted novel.

 DISCOVERING AMERICA by Liza Wieland (Random House: $20; 265 pp.) There's a 
type of character that dominates "Discovering America," Liza Wieland's first 
short-story collection.At least half of the pieces feature a restless 
girl-woman with an emotionally angular quality that stops just short of being 
true alienation. Other character types appear in more than one story as well, 
though with lesser frequency. The oddly magical misfit boy. The woman who is 
involved with a sweet, stable man and doesn't understand why she still feels so 
hungry and desperate. The sweet, stable man who doesn't understand why either. 
Wieland's work is haunted by the same small group of people, which makes her 
book feel like a novel trapped in the body of a short-story collection. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a good novel though, full of old-fashioned sadness. In fact, many pieces 
seem as if they take place in another era, in spite of the mention of videos, 
7-Elevens and home pregnancy tests. These are stories about travel, about the 
vast expanse of territory both outside our car and inside our hearts. Liza 
Wieland clearly knows how to write. The problem is, "Discovering America" 
confines all the similar characters and situations back-to-back, which 
ultimately blurs the boundaries between each story and drains away much of 
their power.

SECOND NATURE, BY RODNEY JONES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So quickly I forgot the things that brought me joy, 
</P>
<P>
 The way a blind man assumes the obvious dark 
</P>
<P>
 Of a familiar room, atlas of rug and banister, 
</P>
<P>
 The depths of stairs, the torque of glass knobs, 
</P>
<P>
 The durable links compounding out of ease, 
</P>
<P>
 So many strong and nurturing people that I loved 
</P>
<P>
 Dimmed among habits. I could see so clearly 
</P>
<P>
 Each scene of injury, places where known tempers 
</P>
<P>
 Flared and defiled, even the mentioned things 
</P>
<P>
 That never happened, the cycles of dogma and ultimatums, 
</P>
<P>
 The married woman's secret upstart mind, and all 
</P>
<P>
 Of those who were like priests, in their celibate duties, 
</P>
<P>
 Like a field mouse wintering between the studs, 
</P>
<P>
 Like something thought of so long before it was written 
</P>
<P>
 That part of its body had fallen away -- which is why 
</P>
<P>
 I woke at 3 a.m., festering some old rage at words, 
</P>
<P>
 But stood back, knowing the animal poised there 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of life, and, sealed inside of me, 
</P>
<P>
 The world's unvarying tracks, all marks of shyness 
</P>
<P>
 That follow the natural shyness of the child, 
</P>
<P>
 The time of one man and one woman in youth, 
</P>
<P>
 And the drier kisses, the tongue receding in the jaw, 
</P>
<P>
 Not the song, but the humming after the song, 
</P>
<P>
 The barrier, the quiet knowledge, called for and unspoken. 
</P>

 JIM HENSON: THE WORKS The Art, the Magic, the Imagination by Christopher Finch 
(Random House: $40; 252 pp.). This affectionate biography traces the career of 
the innovative puppeteer from his early days at WRC-TV in Washington through 
the extraordinary success of "Sesame Street," "The Muppet Show" and the Muppet 
movies.Finch, who also wrote "Of Muppets & Men" (1981), has assembled a wealth 
of color photographs from all phases of Henson's work, including some funny 
behind-the-scenes shots. But "The Works" often feels a little too affectionate 
and uncritical. Finch lavishes superlatives on everything Henson touched, even 
"The Dark Crystal," a pretentious muddle of a movie. His adjectival overkill 
cloys because it's so unnecessary. Henson ranks among the most imaginative 
figures in the history of puppetry and family entertainment; that he created 
greater and lesser films is neither surprising nor shameful. This caveat aside, 
"The Works" will please the legions of fans who still mourn Jim Henson's 
premature death in 1990. Charles Solomon

 Who in the 'hood do you ask about breast cancer? As usual with health issues 
from heart disease to AIDS, what's labeled true for the larger population is 
assumed true for all. I took my question to a session of the Women of Color 
Breast Cancer Survivor Support Project, a group for African American women. I 
got my ears blistered: 
</P>
<P>
 "Doctors are insensitive. They're the issue that started this group." 
</P>
<P>
 * "We face discrimination and neglect. You must insist on information. These 
doctors don't like it when they have to explain and get real surly when you ask 
questions." 
</P>
<P>
 * "They never gave me any educational materials." 
</P>
<P>
 * "My doctor said my examination was in-con-clusive although my tumor had 
doubled in size at 2.5 centimeters, which is second-stage. He told me to GO 
HOME, WAIT and WATCH IT!" 
</P>
<P>
 * "I told my oncologist, 'I can feel it!' He said nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 * "I was very depressed. I didn't need a psychiatrist. I needed a support 
group." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Our women are diagnosed in the later stages and have a higher death rate." 
</P>
<P>
 * "My OB-GYN saw it and remained silent." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Don't trust general practitioners, no matter what color they are." 
</P>
<P>
 * "My tumor had got so large it had burst and was running. I lost a breast and 
a lung. Get a second opinion, a third if necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 * "We tend to be given the strongest medicines without necessarily needing 
them. Without any consideration as to what they might do to us." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Our cultural background has put us in the background." 
</P>
<P>
 * "We're almost totally ignored by every major newspaper and organization." 
</P>
<P>
 * "To talk about us is felt to be too morbid. But we're positive -- we're 
about living." 
</P>
<P>
 * "We have children and landlords to feed. If all I had to cope with was 
breast cancer, I would be fine." 
</P>
<P>
 * "What you do is you put it on the list and you deal." 
</P>
<P>
 * " They don't understand the stress, how we're carrying three to four loads." 
</P>
<P>
 * "It's hard for us -- we're working- and professional-class women. So you can 
imagine how tough it is for sistuhs in the hard-core ghetto." 
</P>
<P>
 * "When you go to a group that's not ethnically sensitive, in their 
neighborhoods, you find them dominated by whites who do not understand 'waiting 
on the check.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * "Little old white ladies are nice but can't relate to how I responded. I was 
angry, real emotional when I found out: 'They're gonna mutilate me!' " 
</P>
<P>
 * "There was this 72-year-old, a 35-year survivor who saw my short hair and 
said, 'That's OK, you don't have much to lose anyway.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * "After speaking to an American Cancer Society rep, most of the support 
groups they refer you to, 'wellness clinics,' are located way out." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Gotta get them tears out . . . gotta cry." 
</P>
<P>
 * 'Going home to an empty house -- it's very scary." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Most of us are abandoned by our men. They're so self-centered." 
</P>
<P>
 * "My boyfriend, a cancer doctor, didn't contact me anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 * "My family didn't make me feel isolated." 
</P>
<P>
 * "You are still a woman even if both breasts are cut off." 
</P>
<P>
 * "My life turned around when I found this group." 
</P>
<P>
 The facts are as strong as the feelings. A study analyzing breast cancer in 
L.A. County from 1981-87 found that while black women contracted the disease at 
lower rates than non-Latino women, they had a lower survival rate (63% compared 
to 75%). 
</P>
<P>
 The Women of Color support group is more than 100 members strong, and despite 
a funding deficit, has branches in Carson, Compton, Pomona and slated for San 
Diego. Initially sponsored by the National Black Leadership Initiative on 
Cancer-Western Region, the group now has headquarters provided by Daniel 
Freeman Memorial Hospital, and volunteers answer the phones (213-418-0627 or 
310-532-5128). Say executive council members P.J. Viviansayles and Nettie 
Almada: "We're on the move. We consider this a victory!"

 There are signs along the way that the 1991 Regarding Henry (NBC Sunday at 9 
p.m.) could have been a less manipulative, more genuine exploration of what 
really matters in life instead of the slick Hollywood shuffle that it is. 
Harrison Ford, more effective than you might have imagined, stars as a 
high-powered Manhattan attorney, a heedless careerist until a desperado's 
bullet in his head leaves him with the mind of a child. 
</P>
<P>
 As a cop thriller, The Rookie (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) is a bummer. As a buddy 
movie -- Clint Eastwood, who also directed, is paired with Charlie Sheen -- it 
is one more tired entry in a terminally fatigued genre. Even as an Eastwood 
vehicle -- an appropriate term for a movie about a cutthroat car-theft ring -- 
the 1990 film is a warmed-over compost. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Line of Duty: The FBI Murders (KCAL Sunday at 10 p.m.) is a real and 
haunting 1988 TV movie re-enactment of a 1985 shootout of unprecedented 
violence between two murderers (Michael Gross, David Soul) and several FBI 
agents, but it teaches us nothing but more fear and disgust for life. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1987 Death Wish 4: The Crackdown (KTLA Friday at 8 p.m.), part of the 
Charles Bronson vigilante series, is verging on self-parody. Director J. Lee 
Thompson, shrewd veteran that he is, takes a plot of stunning simple-mindedness 
and turns it into an efficient, fast-moving, hard-action, good-looking comic 
book fantasy. This time, Bronson gets back into the action when his 
girlfriend's teen-age daughter fatally overdoses on crack. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1987 Over the Top (KTLA Saturday at 6 p.m.), a very, very simple story 
climaxing in a Las Vegas arm-wrestling contest, must qualify as a worst-case 
scenario for Sylvester Stallone (who wrote the script). It's supposed to be a 
heart-tugger about a down-on-his-luck trucker and his snobbish, estranged 
12-year-old son, but it's utterly bogus from start to finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Zoltan Korda's 1935 Sanders of the River (KCET Saturday at 9 p.m.) stars Paul 
Robeson as a river patrol officer in an African adventure tale.

 SONGS OF ENCHANTMENT by Ben Okri (Nan A. Talese: $21; 304 pp.) Azaro is a 
spirit-child, an "unwilling adventurer into chaos and sunlight, into the dreams 
of the living and the dead."The African village where he resides with his 
parents is heavily populated by various types of supernatural beings, and 
though everyone seems to be aware of them, Azaro has a special understanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Songs of Enchantment," Ben Okri's second novel featuring Azaro, exists partly 
in the same spirit world that it chronicles. There is no real beginning or 
middle and only a vague sort of end. Instead of moving forward in the 
traditional linear way, Okri's plot spreads outward in all directions like 
water. Anything can happen at any time -- and it does. As people lose each 
other, cross into other worlds and experience grave danger on almost every 
page, it becomes difficult after a while to ascertain which events have true 
significance, giving the book a slightly arbitrary feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 Okri's style tends to work best when the writing itself is so strong you'll 
keep reading indefinitely just to get to another amazing image. Or maybe 
profound, subversive questions are being addressed, and you'll follow along in 
the hopes of finding answers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Songs of Enchantment" seems to be a book about the redemptive power of love. 
It certainly has it's share of beauty and depth, but for many readers it might 
be a difficult road to get there.

 THE INNER QUARTERS: Marriage and the Lives of Chinese Women in the Sung Period 
by Patricia Buckley Ebrey (University of California Press: $45; 332 pp.) 
History, well-written, can have the excitement and depth of good fiction along 
with the cultural relevance of a documentary.Most of the time, however, we are 
treated to names, dates and wilted retellings of events that resonate with our 
lives about as much as a stranger's gas bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Inner Quarters," Patricia Buckley Ebrey's account of the lives of Chinese 
women during the Sung Period (960-1279), has some fascinating sections. But 
other parts manage to suck the lifeblood out of even the most titillating 
subjects, such as adultery and divorce. Some of Ebrey's best work concerns 
husband and wife relations. Since it was common for a man to bring concubines 
into his household, particularly when his wife's physical beauty began to fade, 
jealousy was a real problem. The writing in this section is insightful and 
vibrant. Another strong chapter concerns women and their work making cloth, an 
extremely important aspect of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 A word of caution: It seems Ebrey is trying to look at Chinese culture during 
the Sung Period without the framework of contemporary Western ideas. For 
example, here are her thoughts on foot-binding: "One test of our ability to 
understand the mentality of Sung China is to set aside these modern readings of 
the symbolism of foot-binding and to try to see how . . . both men and women . 
. . could have seen tiny bound feet as symbols of beauty rather than 
subjection." 
</P>
<P>
 Wait a minute, many feminists might reply. In Sung China beauty was 
subjection. The majority of these women were cripples. One may wish Ebrey would 
look at this integral part of Sung culture a little more closely.

<P>
 A CITY YEAR by Suzanne Goldsmith (The New Press: $22.95; 304 pp.) In 
1990-1991, Suzanne Goldsmith, a young Harvard-educated reporter, spent nine 
months with a Boston-based community service program called City Year.She 
followed a diverse team of young people, many of them high school dropouts, as 
they reclaimed a community garden from drug dealers, tutored urban-area school 
children and renovated buildings for the homeless. The team members, an Asian 
immigrant, a white prep-school graduate, an ex-con, a black middle-class 
college student, a foster child and a grab bag of other racial and 
socioeconomic types, received $100 a week and either $2,500 in cash on 
completion of the program, or a $5,000 college scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not surprising that the group soon runs into trouble with many team 
members either dropping out or getting fired. However, people who aren't sure 
if national service is a good idea may be converts by the end of this book. As 
Tony, the team supervisor says, "Youth service is not the solution. What it 
does is help us do the work that allows us to find the solution. The work of 
diversity, the work of growing up, the work of taking personal responsibility . 
. . the work of building community." 
</P>
<P>
 The only problem with "A City Year" is Goldsmith doesn't always seem to 
remember that we never met these kids. Many readers will find it difficult 
matching names and personalities and there are quite a few team members who 
never become fully realized on the page. Yet the writing is so passionate, the 
ideals so generous, that it's easy to forgive a few overly minimalist 
descriptions.

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; ABC'S 'SKATING ADVENTURE' IS THAT 
AND MORE FOR 12-YEAR-OLD REPORTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Maria Sansone, 12, never dreamed she'd be part of a news story of tabloid 
proportions when she attended the National Figure Skating Championships at Cobo 
Arena in Detroit on Jan. 6. Sansone was covering the event from a kid's-eye 
view for ABC's Wide World of Sports for Kids: Kids on Ice! A Skating Adventure 
when skater Nancy Kerrigan was attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was actually there," Sansone says from her Erie, Pa., home. "But I didn't 
realize what was happening until I heard another reporter talking about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sansone, whose previous national sports-reporting experience was covering the 
Little League World Series last summer, had the instincts to attend a press 
conference immediately after the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could see me (on television) at the conference," says Sansone, who is 
believed to be the youngest network reporter in TV sports history. "(The 
attack) is definitely something kids are interested in." 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, Sansone says, kids love skating: "It is so graceful and 
difficult, and that's what you associate with skating." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kerrigan assault -- and the almost immediate accusations of a rival's plot 
-- were a shock to Sansone. She believes her peers will feel the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so unreal," she says, thoughtfully. "Kids are very competitive, and if 
they see their idols are possibly going to such lengths to win, why can't they? 
It's such a bad example to kids." 
</P>
<P>
 A bad example is especially disappointing in a sport that Sansone calls 
"unlike any other." She adds: "No matter how much you practice, how good you 
are or how much you practice, you can fall from a jump and then have to get up 
quickly and smile. It's hard to do that, so skaters get a lot of respect." 
</P>
<P>
 Sansone has a lot of respect for her co-host Kristi Yamaguchi, who appears in 
the opening demonstrating some of the more difficult skating maneuvers on the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 Sansone will talk to young athletes whose lives are ruled by skating; many do 
not attend regular school but have tutors. There's also a look at the 
competition via 13-year-old Amanda Ward. Costumes, ice shows, judging, the 
technical vs. the artistic, and long and short performances are explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there's a look at the skating life as well as a behind-the-scenes 
glimpse at nationals for both seniors and juniors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wide World of Sports For Kids: Kids on Ice! A Skating Adventure" airs 
Saturday at 11:30 a.m. on ABC. For ages 6 and up. More Family Shows 
</P>
<P>
 Food is definitely fun on this week's Clarissa Explains It All (Sunday 
noon-12:30 p.m. Nickelodeon), episode called "Janet & Clarissa, Inc." Clarissa 
and her classmates are assigned to invent and market an environmentally safe

dropped on the floor, Clarissa gets the great idea for a fun new food: Bouncy 
Balls. Could she and her mom go into business for real? For ages 8 to 13.  
</P>
<P>
 In the Showtime original movie Last Breeze of Summer (Thursday 9:30-10 p.m. 
Showtime), a young black girl is thrust into social and racial upheaval when 
she's selected to help integrate an all-white school in a small Texas town.

FOOD AS SOCIAL HISTORY; JAMES BEARD, BY ROBERT CLARK (HARPERCOLLINS: $27.50, 
357 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Karen Stabiner, Karen Stabiner is a regular reviewer for View. Her book 
Inventing Desire was published last year.

<P>
 Do not mistake this for one of those denatured celebrity swipes that all too 
often masquerade as biographies. It seems these days that anyone who's been 
famous for 10 minutes or dead for 12 gets a book, many of which read like 
dozens of press clippings strung together. 
</P>
<P>
 But this life of James Beard, who dominated the American food scene for almost 
50 years, is as much a work of social history as it is the biography of a 
single individual. 
</P>
<P>
 Author Robert Clark recognized that Beard lived at that most fascinating of 
intersections, where national and individual interests meet. 
</P>
<P>
 By choosing to write about Beard -- about whom Julia Child said, "In the 
beginning there was Beard," as though he had created our national cuisine 
single-handedly -- he has written about much more. Many of today's food gurus 
made their way because of (or in spite of) their relationship with a difficult 
master. 
</P>
<P>
 James Beard was born in Portland, Ore., in 1903, and if the circumstances of 
one's birth presage the life he will lead, Beard was destined from the first to 
stand out. He weighed, according to various reports, 13 or 14 pounds, and his 
parents were an unusual match: Mary, who arrived in Toronto from her native 
England at 17 and finally settled in Portland, where she carved a niche for 
herself as the owner of a small boarding house and a proponent of high-quality, 
if simple, food; and John, who chose a bride primarily because he, a widower, 
needed help with a recalcitrant daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Beard the elder had little interest in his family, and spent most of his time 
in Chinatown, where he eventually sired another child. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mary Beard projected her formidable ambitions on the one man in her 
household who paid attention to her -- her son, James. He inherited her 
interest in food, and was stamped with her desire for recognition: the perfect 
recipe for a food celebrity. 
</P>
<P>
 As Clark explains, the country was ready for Beard just at the time that he 
was prepared to abandon his theatrical aspirations and turn a sideline -- 
catering for friends -- into the centerpiece of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 There are fashions in food, as in any other aspect of our culture, and the 
economics of food production and consumption had changed during Beard's 
childhood. The small local producers his mother revered, and sought out for 
both her hotel and her home, were being edged out by large corporate concerns 
that could save people money and offer them reassuring, if too often tasteless, 
uniformity. The home economists came along and told people that eating too well 
-- eating for taste and sensation -- was some kind of a sin, and that the real 
value of food was in its purely nutritional value, as though it were so many 
lumps of coal for the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Beard's physical presence, particularly his impressive girth, advertised his 
unabashed love of food; like his mother, he loved dishes based on whatever 
bounty a particular region had to offer. But he also had a remunerative pact 
with the devil -- endorsement deals with everyone from Green Giant vegetables 
to Pillsbury, just the sort of corporate suppliers who suffocated the small 
local producers he had been brought up to respect. Self-hatred was at the 
center of Beard's professional life. However much the foodie public might love 
him, he failed to satisfy himself (or perhaps his mother), and was besieged by 
bitter doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark has amassed a mountain of material, and has the self-confidence of a 
fine cook who sees connections between ingredients that others, tied to the 
literal reality of a recipe, might miss. Sometimes the prose can get a bit 
heavy; he has a tendency to try to fold the most glancing bit of information 
into his overall themes. But even the slower passages are fascinating, and the 
book an ambitious success. 
</P>
<P>
 The general citizenry may think that people who dwell on what they eat are 
peripheral; their concerns insignificant and self-indulgent. Clark's work is a 
triumphant retort. He understands that the best food writing is not so much 
about how the grub is, but about who's eating it and why.

MIDSEASON SHIFTS AND SHOVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN ELBER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's time for TV's midseason metamorphosis, when networks dump their 
weak-witted sitcoms and struggling dramas and introduce ... well, more of the 
same. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, OK, let's give them a chance. Maybe a butterfly or two will emerge. 
</P>
<P>
 A moment, however, for a couple of the dearly departed. The big loss: NBC's 
fine family drama "Against the Grain," set in a football-crazy Texas town. 
Despite good reviews, it couldn't get a ratings first down. 
</P>
<P>
 Also gone is ABC's lightly plotted but charmingly played "Moon Over Miami," a 
"Moonlighting" couldabeen. The network claims it's on hiatus, but expect that 
to be a permanent condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the contenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Five new series are already up and running, including ABC's "Birdland" (10 
p.m. Wednesday), starring Brian Dennehy as a hospital psychiatric director. CBS 
has "Burke's Law," with Gene Barry picking up the sleuth role he played 30 
years ago (9 p.m. Friday). 
</P>
<P>
 Fox gave the midseason nod to "The George Carlin Show" (9:30 p.m. Sunday), 
featuring the comedian's verbal antics, and to Henry Winkler as a Rush 
Limbaugh-type in "Monty" (8 p.m. Tuesday). 
</P>
<P>
 "The Critic," a half-hour cartoon from the producers of Fox's "The Simpsons," 
airs at 8:30 p.m. Wednesday. Jon Lovitz provides the voice of Jay Sherman, a 
pudgy, acerbic New York film critic coping with a tough boss, a spiteful 
ex-wife and lousy movies. The bright spot is his young son. 
</P>
<P>
 A pack of other shows wait in the wings. ABC is staking its hopes on a mix of 
sitcoms, dramas, a news magazine and one animated comedy series. 
</P>
<P>
 "Byrds of Paradise" from producer Steven Bochco (riding high with "NYPD Blue") 
stars "thirtysomething" alumnus Timothy Busfield. He plays a Yale professor who 
moves with his three children to Hawaii after his wife is murdered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thunder Alley" features Ed Asner as a retired stock-car racer who opens his 
Indianapolis home to his newly divorced daughter and her trio of children. 
</P>
<P>
 Comedian Ellen DeGeneres stars in "These Friends of Mine." She's a single 
woman in Los Angeles, a Mary Tyler Moore for the '90s, say the producers. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackee Harry and Tim Reid star in "Sister, Sister" as the single parents of 
adopted twin girls. When the girls discover each other at age 13, Harry and 
Reid decide to move in together. 
</P>
<P>
 Throw another news magazine on the TV fire: "Turning Point," with 
correspondents Meredith Vieira, John Donvan, Don Kladstrup and Deborah Amos, 
premieres March 9. The twist: It features one story and one reporter per 
outing. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS has three comedies and two dramas in the wings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom" bows at 8 p.m. Wednesday, March 2, with Tom Arnold starring as a 
working-class man who tries to build a dreamhouse for his family on a Kansas 
farm -- next to a city dump. Arnold and wife Roseanne are co-creators. 
</P>
<P>
 The drama "Traps" starring George C. Scott as a veteran homicide chief and Dan 
Cortese as his nonconformist grandson, also a detective, follows at 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Allen and Terence Knox star as husband and wife in the drama "Down 
Home," a chronicle of an extended family living along North Carolina's tide 
waters, premiering at 9 p.m. on Friday, March 5. Don't be surprised if the 
title changes on this one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Muddling Through" is to be an offbeat comedy starring Stephanie Hodge as a 
woman who has spent three years in jail for shooting her unfaithful husband, 
and who now wants her old life back. 
</P>
<P>
 Producer Norman Lear of "All in the Family" fame is back with "704 Hauser." 
It's "Family" in reverse: the sitcom stars John Amos as a blue-collar liberal 
bedeviled by an ultraconservative son. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC has announced a single midseason entry so far. "Winnetka Road" comes from 
Aaron Spelling, that master of serial drama, and stars Ed Begley Jr., Meg Tilly 
and Josh Brolin in a Midwestern saga. 
</P>
<P>
 A pair of Fox shows, one a sober-minded sitcom and the other a reality-based 
series, also will be courting viewers soon. 
</P>
<P>
 So many shows, so few time slots. Incumbents, do you know where your ratings 
are?

 Knowing KTLA's Jennifer York is flying above L.A. in the Channel 5 helicopter 
every morning is like having a guardian angel looking after us. She is one of 
the main reasons I religiously watch the "KTLA Morning News."She deserves a 
great deal of credit -- and an Emmy -- for her coverage of the Northridge 
earthquake and its impact on traffic conditions.

</P>
<P>
 It's about time Helen Hunt ("Mad About You," NBC) was recognized as the fine 
comedian that she is. (During the Jan. 22 Golden Globes Awards show on TBS, 
Hunt won best actress in a comedy series.)

 Regarding Dick and Joyce Van Patten (Just Asking, TV Times Jan. 16): Joyce 
actually appeared with Dick back in the '30s -- and didn't wait until the '50s. 
I know because they both acted with me in a play titled "Come Home to Roost," 
playing my children. They were about 6 and 4 -- and totally beguiling.

</P>
<P>
 Carroll O'Connor and Andy Griffith, two outstanding veteran actors whose shows 
have run the gamut from early sitcoms to high-level drama, now can be joined by 
a third -- Dick Van Dyke. He is excellent and affable in his role of 
doctor/sleuth in CBS' "Diagnosis Murder."

 Three months ago, Caltrans was absolutely gaga over its newest progeny -- the 
Century Freeway. The I-105, a 17.3-mile stretch from El Segundo to Norwalk, 
made it possible to get from Downtown to the airport in 17 to 20 minutes 
instead of 30 to 35, a dream come true for motorists, especially shuttle and 
taxi drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Northridge earthquake, everyone is still impressed. The 
state-of-the-art freeway survived intact. It's more heavily traveled than 
before, as thwarted I-10 patrons seek alternate routes, but drivers say it's 
still a breeze. According to Caltrans representative Pat Reid, there is no 
indication that it will not remain so. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Cogliati, a dispatcher at Super Shuttle, calls the I-105 "just 
incredible. It dramatically cuts our time from Downtown, South Bay and any area 
along the crowded I-91 corridor." 
</P>
<P>
 Gabriel Nwajuaku, treasurer of Checker Cab of L.A., says his drivers are still 
"cutting out 25% of their driving time at least." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, they charge their usual fares ($24 for a taxi from Downtown, $13 
for a shared shuttle). "We have a set price to LAX," says Nwajuaku, "and that 
price has not changed." 
</P>
<P>
 It's nice to know that something hasn't. Jill Stewart

PALM LATITUDES: STATE OF MIND; MR. LUCKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mark Ehrman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You'd think I was God's favorite the way these announcements told me about all 
the prizes I had won. They tended to be low-key affairs; no famous talk-show 
sidekicks waving through the envelope's cellophane window. One even looked 
horrifyingly like a collection agency notice, emblazoned with the words 
"EXTREMELY URGENT." 
</P>
<P>
 "Please call me at your earliest convenience regarding sweepstakes entry 
149277191," the contents read. I didn't recall entering a sweepstakes but I 
called the toll-free number anyway. I must've sounded too suspicious because 
the person at the other end abruptly got rid of me. 
</P>
<P>
 Determined to claim some prize, I erased all traces of cynicism from my voice 
for my next call, to a company that assured me that I was a sure thing to 
receive at least one of five "major awards." The woman told me I was a 
credit-card holder in good standing and thus chosen for this special promotion. 
She asked for an expiration date from one of my credit cards. I gave her a fake 
one. She went to "access her computer." 
</P>
<P>
 "Congratulations, Mr. Ehrman," she trilled. "Let me tell you about some of the 
awards you'll receive": exciting vacations to Florida, Mexico, Las Vegas and 
Lake Tahoe, not to mention a camera and makeup from Bianca of Beverly Hills. 
Yessiree, more than $2,000 worth of stuff. "Oh, Mr. Ehrman, there's one more 
thing." Seems they needed a "processing fee" up front -- $698.50 to be exact. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have it," I pleaded. "I'm broke from Christmas shopping." 
</P>
<P>
 "No problem," she urged. "We'll take it in three payments on your MasterCard." 
I got off the phone.  
</P>
<P>
 "It is in violation of California law for anyone to tell you that you've won a 
prize and then ask you to pay anything," says Herschel Elkins, head of the 
consumer law section of the state attorney general's office. "And that means 
anything -- to buy a product, pay taxes or submit a processing fee." 
</P>
<P>
 Though authorities frequently arrest the perpetrators of these schemes, new 
cons spring up as quickly as the old ones are busted. Indeed, the next day I 
received a card from an outfit in Tampa saying I was "selected to receive a 9 
day/8 night Tropical Vacation Offer." Hotels, beaches, cruises, Disney World -- 
the works. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, there was just one catch . . . . Mark Ehrman

DEEP POCKETS; THE COST OF TALENT: HOW EXECUTIVES AND PROFESSIONALS ARE PAID AND 
HOW IT AFFECTS AMERICA, BY DEREK BOK (FREE PRESS: $22.95; 341 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Allan Sloan, Allan Sloan, a syndicated columnist for Newsday, frequently 
writes about financial excesses. His column appears in the Times' business 
section on Sundays. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stories about the obscene incomes of top business executives have become one 
of our signs of spring. As the snows melt and robins reappear, corporations 
disclose how much they paid their top executives in the previous year, and how 
much these folks made by exercising their stock options. 
</P>
<P>
 Public outrage has grown in recent years as companies have engaged in massive 
layoffs while the income of top executives has gone to the moon, thanks to 
increases in their salaries and bonuses and -- much more important -- thanks to 
huge profits created by the long-running bull market for stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Who can forget the late Steve Ross, chairman of Time Warner Inc., knocking 
down $78 million while the company was laying off writers to save money? Who 
can forget General Motors increasing its former chairman's pension 
retroactively while asking the United Auto Workers union to moderate its wage 
and benefit demands? 
</P>
<P>
 Or, for that matter, who can forget last year's announcement that Walt Disney 
Chairman Steven Eisner was taking $200 million in stock-option profits? 
</P>
<P>
 All the uproar has moved executive pay to the front pages from the business 
pages, and fat-cat chief executive officers have become a populist villain. 
Candidate Bill Clinton announced that if elected President, he would introduce 
legislation to stop companies from deducting more than $1 million a year in 
salary and bonuses to top officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton was elected, his proposal became law. The problem is that it's having 
little effect. Companies can still deduct the full expense of non-officers, so 
the Dodgers deduct all of Darryl Strawberry's $4-million-plus annual salary and 
Salomon Brothers can deduct the $5 million it might pay some bond wizard. And, 
provided they go through the proper paper-shuffling, corporations can still 
deduct in full the salaries and bonuses of top executives. 
</P>
<P>
 This is an example of good intentions colliding with real life. It's easy to 
talk a solution, it's much harder to create one that actually works. 
</P>
<P>
 And what does excessive income mean? Compared to what? Most of the huge 
incomes of top executives aren't salaries and bonuses but, rather, profits 
they've made on stock options. The salary income and stock-based income are 
generally lumped together, but they're really separate. Salaries are pretty 
much guaranteed and come from corporate coffers. Stock market profits are a 
whole other game. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner's $200 million came from options, as did $75 million of Steve Ross' $78 
million. Who's to say they don't deserve the money? Disney's stock market value 
had risen $20 billion during Eisner's regime -- is giving him 1% of the swag so 
unreasonable? And Steve Ross, who did have salaries and perks that I considered 
obscene, made billions of dollars for Warner Communications stockholders when 
he peddled Warner to Time Inc., now Time Warner. Is the $75 million 
unreasonable, considering the billions that Warner shareholders made? 
</P>
<P>
 So even though it's lots of fun to scream about financial excesses -- I do 
that for a living -- it's much easier to scream than it is to solve the problem 
of excessive executive pay. If it's in fact a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Which brings us to "The Cost of Talent," a book on a populist subject by Derek 
Bok, former president of Harvard University, one of the nation's most elite 
institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 You would hope that such a man would produce an interesting and incisive book 
on such an interesting topic. Unfortunately, you would be wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble starts on the first page of Chapter 1. Bok, trying to get off to a 
lively start -- that's what we writers are supposed to do -- reconstructs a 
conversation between the chairman of CBS Inc. and anchorman Dan Rather. 
</P>
<P>
 But the writing is a little clunky. Even worse, as Bok honorably and clearly 
discloses in the footnotes, his account is based entirely on other peoples' 
work: a New York Times article and Ken Auletta's 1991 book, "Three Blind Mice." 
</P>
<P>
 To top things off, Bok gets the first name of CBS' chairman wrong. It's 
Laurence Tisch, not Leonard Tisch. If Tisch had given as many millions to 
Harvard as he's given to his alma mater, New York University, which is 
considerably less upscale, Bok or his assistants or his editors would probably 
have gotten the name right. 
</P>
<P>
 While one wrong name isn't that big a deal, getting the name of one of the 
country's most prominent businesspeople wrong on Page 1 is off-putting. And the 
opening anecdote symbolizes what's wrong with this book. 
</P>
<P>
 The book isn't based on original research, or on information gained by 
interviewing the people Bok is writing about. Read all 548 footnotes, and you 
find five based on a random survey of Phi Beta Kappas that Bok did from 
1970-1990, and two more based on numbers that people computed for him. The 
other 541 are all other peoples' work. There's not one footnote based on author 
interviews. Not a good sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Bok, who has spent his life in academe, surveys the literature, comes down 
from his ivory tower and takes us through a convoluted exercise designed to 
show us how Bok concluded the obvious: that many top corporate executives, 
doctors and lawyers are overpaid by any rational standard. What a shocker! He 
decides -- another surprise -- that university professors and schoolteachers 
are underpaid compared to these groups. And that federal civil servants are, 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 Bok says, quite rightly, that the so-called free market doesn't do an 
appropriate job of deciding what to pay the "overpaid" professions, because the 
market isn't really free. Top executives sit on each others' board of directors 
and help decide each others' pay -- which isn't conducive to arm's-length 
bargaining. And very few consumers are in a position to comparison-shop for 
medical and legal services. You don't get doctors' bids on the operating table. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair enough. 
</P>
<P>
 What Bok doesn't stress sufficiently is that his three "underpaid" groups have 
something the "overpaid" groups don't: tenure. Once educators and civil 
servants have been around a while, they're employed for life, provided their 
employer stays in business. Being employed for life is very valuable, even 
though it doesn't show up in your paycheck. Nor does Bok give much weight to 
the fact that doctors and lawyers -- and yes, even chief executives -- 
generally work far longer hours than educators and civil servants. 
</P>
<P>
 Bok is, of course, quite right that many executive incomes have no reasonable 
relationship to how well executives have led their companies. What to do about 
this problem? Bok proposes a sharp increase in tax rates on very high incomes 
to tax away most of the obscene salaries and stock profits earned by overpaid 
executives. But the rich and powerful will find a way to dodge these taxes. And 
even if they don't, taxing ultra-high incomes at ultra-high rates doesn't solve 
the very real morale and fairness problems of paying a chief executive 1,000 
times what a low-ranking employee earns. 
</P>
<P>
 And Bok ignores the problems of private companies, where the really big money 
is earned. Last year, for instance, superstar money-manager George Soros 
reportedly made more than $625 million as his cut of the profits on the money 
he managed for his investors. Soros made Michael Eisner's $200 million, earned 
for Disney options Eisner held for 10 years, look like pocket change. 
</P>
<P>
 Bok talks about expanding educational opportunities -- which is heading in the 
right direction, but not far enough. As long as we're in Ivory Towerland -- Bok 
proposes to equalize opportunities by having the federal government help some 
parents pay for private college, more than a little self-serving for a Harvard 
man -- why not expand economic opportunities? 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of carping about what the No. 1 guy gets, let's encourage -- nay, 
require -- companies to give long-term employees options and bonuses tied to 
the chief executive's package. That would give everyone a piece of the action. 
And it would force boards of directors to think twice before giving away the 
store to the chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 We also should require Bok to get a little real-world experience before 
telling the rest of us how to run our lives. If he's good, we'll let him 
re-apply for admission for the spring semester.

PALM LATITUDES: SPORT REPORT; BIG WHEELS

<TEXT>
<P>
 When he was a child, Arthur Dillon rode as a child. On a regular bike with 
24-inch wheels. Now that he's a man, he naturally rides a man's cycle -- with 
132-inch wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 That's right, 11-foot wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 Dillon, a house painter living in Inglewood, has been making crazy bikes since 
he was a kid. "I was 11. I saw this guy riding on two bikes he'd welded 
together vertically. Six and a half feet tall! I said, 'I can do that.' I've 
been doing it ever since." 
</P>
<P>
 But his first serious attempt at a big bike came 20 years later, when he 
welded a frame for the 48-inch wheels of two "bone-shakers" -- the 
turn-of-the-century bikes with huge front wheels and tiny rear wheels. He has 
since made or collected everything from a "pyramid bike" -- three bikes he 
welded on top of each other for him and his two kids to ride at the same time 
-- to a unicycle with a seven-foot wheel. "My daughter Tralyia -- she's 15 -- 
she got on that thing and rode off first time, no trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 But nine months ago, Dillon got really ambitious. "I thought, 'I can go bigger 
than bone-shakers; I'm going to build the biggest bike in the world.' " 
</P>
<P>
 So he got a friend to build him two 11-foot wheels, while he made the frame. 
But when he assembled it, he found that it was impossible to balance. "So I 
decided to go for the world's biggest tricycle" and added a 70-inch front 
wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 His 7-year-old son Christopher sits in a special seat above. "We ride in 
parades like the Martin Luther King Day," says Dillon. "He loves it. I think 
I've got him hooked, just like I was." 
</P>
<P>
 What about the Guinness Book of World Records? "They've said they want to see 
pictures and interview friends and neighbors," he says. "But heck, how can they 
turn me down? You'd have to be mad to make one any bigger." Bill Manson

HOW NOT TO APPROACH ANOTHER CULTURE; INDIAN TIME: A YEAR OF DISCOVERY WITH THE

Mexico.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Native Americans may be our most-loved minority -- if loving native Americans 
means harboring a warm, fuzzy feeling for their spirituality that does not 
permit them to be encountered as modern, complex people. Not surprisingly, some 
native Americans feel they are being loved to death. Looking askance at 
eclectic non-native American wanna-bes who partake of such spiritual practices 
as sweat lodges and peyote ceremonies, they fear yet one more treasure is being 
stolen from them: their culture. With native Americans all the rage in certain 
circles, publishers are issuing a stream of books with native American themes 
that range from honest efforts to explore modern native American life in all 
its richness to blatant exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Into the latter category falls "Indian Time: A Year of Discovery With the 
Native Americans of the Southwest," an example of a writer succumbing to the 
urge to make a quick buck from her encounter. Author Judith Fein seems full of 
good intentions. She constantly marvels at the generosity of the Pueblo Indian 
families who invite her to dine with them whenever she shows up for village 
ceremonies as part of her research for a proposed television series. 
</P>
<P>
 A screenwriter and self-described phobic living a hectic and miserable 
existence in Los Angeles, Fein finds her life transformed during the seven 
months she spends getting to know New Mexico'snative Americans. She is struck 
by their warmth, as well as their sense of community and connectedness to 
nature, so much so that she starts to view herself differently and overcome her 
fears. She hopes her book will serve as a "bridge" between the dominant culture 
and the indigenous people of the Southwest. But there is a telling omission. 
While Fein and her husband fret about taking so much from people of often 
meager means, they never bother to prepare a dish to contribute to the family 
meals they so often intrude upon. (She seems blissfully unaware that Pueblo 
people often feel obligated to extend hospitality to strangers, even when they 
show up unannounced.) "Indian Time" is, in fact, a chronicle of greediness. 
</P>
<P>
 Starry eyed overnative American culture, Fein has an insatiable desire to 
witness as many Pueblo dances as possible, accumulating encounters with Indians 
like so many trophies. She asks pointed questions about Pueblo religious 
customs, ignoring her hosts' well-founded reluctance to discuss the subject 
with outsiders and perkily chalking up her rudeness to her irrepressible 
curiosity. Absorbed in her own drama, Fein happily discloses personal facts 
about the people she meets, including drinking problems and marital woes. 
Although she claims her subjects encouraged her to use their names and stories, 
one wonders whether they really understood that she was writing down everything 
they said. Would they have agreed knowing that the book is "soon to be a major 
motion picture," as the dust jacket advertises? Compiled from a collection of 
letters Fein wrote to friends and relatives, the book is written in a chatty 
Dear Diary style that is meant to be engaging, but choppy editing and small 
factual errors reveal the publisher's unseemly haste to jump on thenative 
American book bandwagon. Although advertised as one woman's "fabulous journey" 
of discovery among the native cultures of the Southwest, "Indian Time" is 
really about Fein's own neediness, a record of how she usednative American 
culture for her personal course of self-help therapy. It's poor repayment for 
the generosity she was shown. 
</P>
<P>
 Thankfully, not all books aboutnative Americans are quickie rip-offs. For 
example, Stephen Trimble's new work, "The People: Indians of the American 
Southwest," reflects nearly a decade of painstaking research that has paid off 
handsomely. Surveying the nearly 50 tribes and pueblos of Arizona and New 
Mexico, southern Utah and southwestern Colorado, the book dares to let native 
Americans speak in their own voices about the challenges they confront. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the subject is economic development or the struggle to define a native 
American identity in the midst of a dominant culture, Trimble is a respectful 
and compassionate listener. 
</P>
<P>
 In Trimble's Southwest, nati e Americans aren't spiritual icons. They are 
poets, potters, ranchers and politicians, leading ordinary lives in the modern 
world that happen to be distinguished by a unique sense of identity. Trimble's 
graceful photographs of people and places likewise resist the urge to 
sentimentalize. He writes with a rich consciousness of each tribe's traditions 
and culture. Looking deeply into the ongoing interplay between people and their 
environment, he comprehends how native Americans have adapted and continue to 
adapt in the name of survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Where Fein's book is primarily about herself, Trimble's is panoramic in scope, 
taking in millennia of history and peoples as diverse as the Apaches, the Zunis 
and the Southern Paiute. Trimble himself is largely transparent in the book, 
resisting the compulsion to advertise a special relationship with the native 
Americans he encounters. He chooses instead to let their words say what needs 
to be said. "The People," in short, is not about taking. In his introduction, 
Trimble recalls a Southern Ute educator who told him, "We've given you a piece 
of your lives. You then have the responsibility to give something in return." 
He acknowledges this, and writes that his book is intended as a gift (not 
insignificantly, a portion of its royalties are to be donated to the Native 
American Rights Fund and other organizations). In the end, Trimble demonstrates 
that it is perfectly possible to write aboutnative American life in a way that 
contributes to real understanding without further exploiting people who fear 
their cultural identity is endangered. The key lies in cultivating an awareness 
of one's motives.

THE BOY WHO WOULD BE BUCHWALD; LEAVING HOME: A MEMOIR, BY ART BUCHWALD (G.P. 
PUTNAM'S SONS: $22.95; 256 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By W. P. Kinsella, W.P. Kinsella is the author of 20-some books of fiction, 
including Shoeless Joe, which became the movie Field of Dreams. Coming later 
this year, Brother Frank's Gospel Hour. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Art Buchwald has always been a straight shooter. If by chance, some of his 
missiles have made clowns, politicians and various instant and age-old 
celebrities dance for the general public's amusement, then so be it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leaving Home" chronicles the first 23 years of Buchwald's life, through a 
hardscrabble childhood, much of it spent in foster homes and the Hebrew Orphan 
Asylum, a stint in the marine corps, and a few years at UCLA, before migrating 
to Paris to seek his fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Buchwald wrote columns for the European edition of the New York 
Herald-Tribune. Returning to America he set up offices in Washington, D.C. His 
syndicated column appears in more than 550 newspapers worldwide. He has written 
29 books, won a Pulitzer Prize and been elected to the American Academy of Arts 
and Letters. His acerbic wit has charmed an international audience for 
generations. His acerbic wit (I have always meant to look up acerbic , but it 
seems a delightful companion to wit , and no editor has ever complained to me, 
so if it ain't broke don't fix it) has charmed an international audience for 
generations. 
</P>
<P>
 Candid is the word that best describes Buchwald's writing. I have no doubt 
that everything he says is true, or as true as time and memory allow it to be. 
I've considered writing my own memoirs. When I do, I think I'll go for 
self-serving, rather than candid. I'm not about to take off the shirt, open the 
chest and bare the heart as Buchwald does so successfully. 
</P>
<P>
 Book reviewing being as subjective as it is, if I wanted to be surly it would 
be easy to say that "Leaving Home" is another in a long line of autobiographies 
by mid-list celebrities. There are no breathtaking confessions, no sexual 
deviance. (I would use the word peccadilloes , except I have never known how to 
spell it, and it reminds me of something I might see under glass and buy by the 
dozen in a New York deli.) 
</P>
<P>
 There are few skeletons in Buchwald's closet. As a writer of memoir he will 
never give Madonna any competition. But for people who have laughed at and with 
Art Buchwald for over 40 years, this candid look at the man behind the 
columnist can't help but please. 
</P>
<P>
 Though his sins are few, he is not hesitant to enumerate them in a way that 
reveals what a sensitive and gentle man he really is. Living in a dysfunctional 
foster family, the emotionally repressed Buchwald showed assertiveness where he 
could. In this case, while walking the foster family's poodle: "As we strolled 
along, I would scare it by snapping the leash hard with a crack in front of 
him. I never hit him, but my voice was very cruel, and he shook in fear of me. 
. . . I have been so ashamed of this, I even debated whether to include it in 
this book or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Buchwald candidly and humorously describes being caught shoplifting in 
Woolworth's at age 11. "Finally it was decided to let me go -- on condition 
that I never enter the store again. Over 60 years have gone by and to this day 
I have never gone into a Woolworth's store. It wasn't a bad lesson. They did 
scare hell out of me. . . I might have wound up in the underworld or at least 
in the public relations business." 
</P>
<P>
 Anger, I have always maintained, generates humor. Those who are oppressed 
survive by making fun of their oppressors. Buchwald confirms my belief. "My 
anger was buried deep behind the humor. I have always had trouble with anger. I 
have swallowed it . . . People ask what I am really trying to do with humor. 
The answer is, 'I'm getting even.' . . . For me being funny is the best 
revenge." Amen! 
</P>
<P>
 Like many humorists and comedians (including myself) Buchwald has suffered 
from bouts of depression. I'll bet there is a book out there call "Humor and 
Prozac," or "Prose and Prozac." I wonder if Dave Barry is depressive. 
</P>
<P>
 After candid , chutzpah is the best word for this memoir. Chutzpah translates 
loosely as "walking where angels fear to tread," and also involves refusing to 
take no for an answer. When Buchwald first makes his pitch to become an 
entertainment columnist to Eric Hawkins of the European edition of the 
Herald-Tribune, for instance, Hawkins listens none too attentively, then says, 
"We're not interested and, even if we were, we wouldn't hire you to write it. 
Now get out of here." Interpreting Hawkins' words not as a rejection but as a 
challenge, Buchwald waited until Hawkins was out of town, pitched another 
editor and was hired. 
</P>
<P>
 On another occasion, pursuing an after-school job at Paramount Pictures in New 
York, Buchwald made a cold call at the personnel office. Seeing the name John 
O'Connell on the glass door, Buchwald had an idea. "I went in and declared to 
the lady at the desk, "Father Murphy sent me." I had uttered the magic words . 
. . He rose to greet me warmly. "How is Father Murphy?" he wanted to know. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just fine and he sends his best. He thought that you might have a job 
for one of this students . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Buchwald landed the job of his dreams. Chutzpah. 
</P>
<P>
 His career as a Marine and his time at USC were primarily uneventful (although 
his lasting relationship with his Marine drill instructor says a lot about the 
man). I'll look forward to the next installment of Buchwald's memoirs, perhaps 
title "Son of Leaving Home," or, "Leaving Home II, Coming Back to America," 
already optioned for the movies by Paramount, starring Eddy Murphy as Art 
Buchwald, with Sly Stallone as Cher, and Ross Perot as himself.

 SEEDS OF CHANGE: The Living Treasure by Kenny Ausubel (HarperSan Francisco: 
$18; 232 pp., illustrated, paperback original). One of the founders explains 
the origins of "Seeds of Change," a mail-order nursery dedicated to preserving 
biodiversity and heirloom species. Ausubel notes, "Of the cornucopia of 
reliable cultivated food plants available to our grandparents in 1900, today 
97% are gone." He and his associates market organically grown seeds of unusual 
varieties of corn, squash, tomatoes, etc. that were raised for flavor, rather 
than commercial viability. Although the author's more-organic-than-thou stance 
occasionally cloys, his book will inspire many readers to try planting 
something tastier and more exotic than the latest hybrids.

 GOING GOING GONE: Vanishing Americana by Susan Jones and Marilyn Nissenson 
(Chronicle: $18.95; 174 pp., paperback original). Jones and Nissenson have 
assembled a wonderful collection of campy old photographs of American pop 
culture; unfortunately, their text often proves less interesting than the 
illustrations. It does seem sad that penmanship, drive-in movies and soda 
fountains are disappearing. But "fan mags" haven't vanished, they've just 
changed their focus, from movie stars to soap opera actors and bubble-gum 
heartthrobs. The Red menace, polio scares and the Motion Picture Production 
Code -- whose departure no one regrets -- seem out of place in a celebration of 
nostalgia.

 TALES OF THE CITY by Armistead Maupin (HarperPerennial: $12; 371 pp.) . 
Viewers who were introduced to Maupin's "Tales" sextet by the PBS mini-series 
may be surprised to discover how much of the nutty dialogue was lifted verbatim 
from the first novel. The improbable yet somehow credible adventures of Mary 
Ann Singleton, Michael Tolliver, Anna Madrigal, Mona Ramsey and their friends 
in 1976 San Francisco form a slyly affectionate elegy to a much-maligned decade 
in America, when the future appeared to offer unlimited opportunities, racial 
and sexual equality seemed imminent and homeless was an adjective applied to 
stray puppies. Was it only 18 years ago?

 LETTERS AT 3 AM: Reports on Endarkment by Michael Ventura (Spring: $16.50; 247 
pp., paperback original). Ventura offers his reflections on life in 
contemporary America in these intelligent, often provocative essays from the 
L.A. Weekly.He looks beyond the superficial vulgarity of Las Vegas to examine 
its underlying ethos, and rails at the willingness of American voters to accept 
censored and even falsified government reports during the Gulf War. But Ventura 
is at his best when he grapples with the qualities that distinguish life in Los 
Angeles. He contemplates the sprawling city with anger, delight, despair and 
impatience, concluding, "Its suffering is real enough, God knows. But its 
beauty is the beauty of letting go: letting go of where you came from; letting 
go of old lessons; letting go of what you want for what you are, or what you 
are for what you want; letting go of so much and that is a hard beauty to 
love."

MURDER AND A BULLDOG; BAD LOVE, BY JONATHAN KELLERMAN (BANTAM: $22.95; 386 PP.) 
 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert Ward, Robert Ward's latest novel, The Cactus Garden, will be 
published by Pocket Books next winter. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Bad Love" is the eighth adventure of Jonathan Kellerman's popular hero, Dr. 
Alex Delaware. Ever since "When the Bough Breaks" (1985), Kellerman has been 
thrilling his growing legion of fans with Delaware's exploits. I've read about 
half the series, and have found them interesting and intelligent. "Bad Love" is 
no exception. This time out, Dr. Delaware, his lady friend Robin and his buddy, 
he gay LAPD detective Milo Sturgis, are up against a fiendish killer who 
specializes in killing shrinks, leaving behind the scrawled cryptic message 
"Bad Love." To make matters worse, Delaware is himself the recipient of a tape 
with a hideous scream and a childlike voice leaving the message, "Bad love, 
don't give me the bad love." Soon after Alex is haunted by an ever escalating 
series of threats, until it becomes clear that he himself is marked for murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex's only clue is a symposium, which he reluctantly served on honoring a 
child psychologist named Dr. Andres de Bosch. One by one the participants in 
that symposium are being dispatched, but neither Alex nor Milo can figure out 
why. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides being a good deal of fun, the novel touches on certain serious themes, 
the most familiar of which (to Kellerman fans) is child abuse. Kellerman 
himself is a former child psychologist and he knows the terrain as well as 
anybody writing today, whether they be mystery or mainstream writers. In this 
novel and others he depicts withdrawn, emotionally maimed children (and adult 
survivors of these unpardonable crimes) with sensitivity and insight. Indeed 
one of the impressive things about Kellerman's books is that he can write about 
the homeless, life in trailer parks, spoiled and angry rich Beverly Hills 
girls, or chunky, sweat-shirt wearing storefront lawyers with a good deal of 
sophistication. It's great fun to hang with Alex Delaware as he makes the 
rounds in Los Angeles, and the book generates a good deal of suspense; by the 
end I was fairly racing through the pages to find out who the killer was and 
what momentous ugliness he had in store for Alex. 
</P>
<P>
 The only problem I've had with Kellerman's books is the voice of Alex Delaware 
himself. He's a bright but brittle and sometimes arrogant narrator, a little 
cold, a little too sure of himself. Kellerman tries to humanize him in this 
book. He gives him more badinage with Robin, he has Alex humbly say that the 
older he gets the more he knows how ignorant he is, and he even uses that 
oldest of warmth inducing ploys -- he gives Dr. D. a bulldog. Still, none of it 
quite makes Delaware lovable. He's always the competent, brilliant guy who is 
liable to hit you with a gibe from Gessell rather than a clenched fist. The 
kind of guy who's the smartest in psych class and wants to be damned sure you 
know it. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, let's give Kellerman credit. He knows his strength ain't lovability, 
but professionalism, and he doesn't pretend Delaware is Capt. Warmth or for 
that matter a macho Superman, like most series detectives. At one point in "Bad 
Love" a baddie with a tire iron comes after Alex and he retreats to a statuary 
in his fish pond. To tell you the truth, that made him more lovable to me than 
anything else Kellerman tried in the book. Be honest guys, given the same 
situation that's what most of us would do. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly enough, Kellerman warms up considerably when writing his 
secondary characters. The author's suspects are a lively lot and he gets their 
snarling and whining, special pleading and willful obfuscations just right. It 
strikes me that he likes his villains and losers better than he likes Delaware 
. . . which is usually the way it is, from Milton to Spillaine. From my own 
experience writing in this genre on Hill Street Blues, I can tell you the 
hardest guy to write was Capt. Frank Furillo. He was too good, too kind, too 
smart and too contained. It was always a lot more fun to write bad Norm Buntz, 
growling sweetie Belker or wise-guy scamster J. D. Larue. . . . Street guys 
with street smarts and attitudes were a kick, yet we all knew that Furillo was 
the core of the show. 
</P>
<P>
 The same is true of Dr. Alex Delaware, and though he is still a little chilly, 
academic and well, fussy . . . he is also bright, insightful and resourceful 
enough. You're in good hands with Kellerman, and to be honest, even though it's 
a shameless ploy, I liked the damned bulldog, Spike, too.

 AS REAL AS IT GETS: The Life of a Hospital at the Center of the AIDS Epidemic 
by Carol Pogash (Plume: $9.95; 255 pp.). In 1981, the staff of San Francisco 
General Hospital found themselves at one epicenter of a nascent epidemic. As 
the numbers grew, these men and women learned how to care for AIDS patients and 
provide comfort, despite the bitter frustration of not being able to cure them. 
Pogash offers a series of moving portraits from the trenches of this battle, 
including a broad spectrum of patients (gay men, heterosexual women, IV 
drug-users), dedicated doctors, researchers and nurses committed to the care of 
others, and a surgeon who treated her Hippocratic Oath like an overcoat -- 
something to be cast off when it became inconvenient.

 THE ROAD PAST ALTAMONT by Gabrielle Roy, translated from the French by Joyce 
Marshall (Bison: $7.95; 146 pp.) and STREET OF RICHES by Gabrielle Roy, 
translated from the French by Harry Binsse (Bison: $8.95; 246 pp.). The gently 
elegiac tone of these two books of stories and sketches by the popular Canadian 
writer suggests a mixture of Willa Cather and Laura Ingalls Wilder. Roy's 
semi-autobiographical work focuses on a French-Canadian family living at the 
outskirts of Winnipeg in the early 20th Century. Beyond their yard stretch the 
vast plains of Manitoba, whose emptiness delineates their lives. "The Road Past 
Altamont" describes how the narrator's perceptions of her mother and 
grandmother shift over time. In one moving passage, Roy describes a child's awe 
at her grandmother's ability to craft a doll from household odds and ends: "For 
a long time I was haunted by the idea that it could not possibly be a man who 
made the world. But perhaps it was an old woman with extremely capable hands." 
"Street of Riches" expands the vision to encompass the narrator's first 
experiences in the world beyond her small provincial city.

 ESPRESSO: Ultimate Coffee by Kenneth Davids (Cole Group: $12.95; 180 pp., 
illustrated, paperback original). Technically, espresso is a beverage prepared 
by forcing hot water through finely ground, dark-roasted coffee, often served 
with foamy steamed milk. Davids traces the history of espresso and cappuccino, 
explains how various coffee-makers work, defines common coffee terms and offers 
an assortment of recipes. At times, the text seems a little too complete: Few 
readers will want to bother roasting their own coffee beans. But "Espresso" 
would make an excellent gift for anyone wondering how to use that 
ominous-looking house-warming/wedding present sitting on the kitchen counter.

 You're not a writer until you've written something it would hurt to get hit 
over the head with. Jan. 17, Southern California put this handy little rule of 
thumb to the test, when at 4:31 a.m., bookshelves all over L.A. pitched out 
their contents and then lurched right after them, as if reconsidering. In an 
apparent victory for Tru-Valu over Ikea, homemade cinder-block-and-plank 
shelves seem to have fared better than store-bought bookcases. At our house, 
the lower blocks functioned almost like gimbals, giving just enough to absorb 
the shock. Unfortunately, the upper blocks functioned like cannonballs. If, 
like mine, your housekeeping life is dedicated to the twin propositions that 1) 
no pile is so precarious it can't be stabilized by another object placed atop 
it just so, and 2) ceilings make the best paperweights, your lot was grief. 
</P>

 Book collector John Krisilas has lived in the same Northridge house since he 
built it in 1957. A week after the quake, the retired spacecraft engineer's 
library still has "two rooms that I can't even get into because everything has 
fallen and blocked the doors." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a bookaholic. I collect T.E. Lawrence, and the English limited edition 
looks like it came through all right. I have a couple of Picasso-signed books, 
and they're buried. It's just a crapshoot, just like the earthquake is. I will 
not buy another book for the rest of my life." Won't it be difficult for a 
confessed bookaholic to go cold turkey? "Alcoholics do it, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 Away from the epicenter, L.A. Reader publisher James Vowell has a story that 
must make John Krisalis weep. Like so many of us, Vowell is a book collector 
only by default. "I don't think I've ever thrown a book away in my life. I 
probably have every textbook I ever used. A Miracle Mile resident, Vowell took 
precautions after the Whittier Narrows quake. "All I did after Whittier was get 
these little screen-door hooks, which I put it in the center of each bookcase. 
They're 50-cent items at a hardware store. I don't think there's a single book 
on the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 But before every bibliolater in the greater metropolitan area races out to the 
corner store, Vowell has another cautionary tale from the quake. "I have a 
friend in Woodland Hills who had three double-width bookshelves filled with 
books. I'm not sure how, but he had attached them to the walls. The bookcases 
came down, and so did all of the Sheetrock. He's got exposed 4-by-4 walls now. 
Who can tell?" But will Vowell put what he's learned at home into practice at 
the Reader, where a number of bookcases toppled? "Damn tootin'." 
</P>
<P>
 Bibliophile Joanne Bernstein's Sunland collection escaped serious damage. "We 
weren't that hard hit. The expensive books didn't happen to be on the top 
shelves. The ones on the top shelves get the worst beating." A former president 
of the Southern California Book Collector's Club, was she putting the more 
valuable ones on the lower shelves with that in mind? "Well, I certainly am 
from now on." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Todd's collection of books printed before 1500 may owe their 
quake-resistance to a similar combination of minor preparation and geographic 
luck. "My rare books are on very deep shelves, the heavy ones at the bottom. 
The chimney fell off and damaged part of the roof, but internally, I'm all 
right." Given the choice between his chimney and his incunabula, "I would 
certainly sacrifice the chimney." 
</P>
<P>
 A member of both the Book Collectors and the redoubtable Zamorano Club, Todd's 
most prized book is "probably a Bible from 1250, 1260, something like that," 
but don't look for it under his chimney bricks. "A lot of my things are at 
UCLA, some at USC, some at Huntington. I don't worry about them there." 
</P>
<P>
 For those of us in whose library-book-sale first editions the Huntington has 
thus far evinced little interest, Ed Todd has this advice: "Keep deep shelves 
for your good books. It's the ones on the edge that fall off." 
</P>
<P>
 For all of us "on the edge" here, there's a large antiquarian book fair coming 
up in near the airport, but John Krisalis has "made a vow not to go." A moment 
later, though, he's making tentative plans to meet a reporter there, and 
grousing about "people like Joyce Carol Oates and John Updike -- they never 
stop writing! I'm going to stop (collecting them) first." 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't that imply there are other writers whom he'll keep collecting, at 
least for a while? Krisilas' laugh is rusty. "You're probably right, but I'm 
not going to agree with you." David Kipen

 John Denning is carrying an assault rifle again. He hadn't planned to. After 
serving as a combat Marine in Vietnam, Denning had hoped to make a living 
carrying nothing more lethal than a blackboard pointer. To that end, he earned 
an elementary-school teaching credential at Cal State Chico. 
</P>
<P>
 But an interesting thing happened on his way to a classroom job: Denning 
learned that he could make a lot more money guarding the state's prisoners than 
he could teaching California's children. And unlike the available teaching 
position, the prison job would be full time. 
</P>
<P>
 So the tall, easygoing Denning holds a 9-millimeter Heckler and Koch rifle as 
he scans a bank of prison cells arrayed in a semicircle before his control 
booth. He is on duty at Mule Creek State Prison in Northern California's Gold 
Country, one of 15 new penitentiaries opened in the past decade to house the 
state's mushrooming convict population. 
</P>
<P>
 After five years in uniform, Denning was earning $14,000 a year more than he 
would have as a teacher in Chico. And he could have saved himself the time, 
trouble and expense of a college education. California prison guards need only 
a high school diploma to qualify for a job that starts at $27,432 per year, 
jumps to $36,768 after two years and tops out at $44,676 after six years, 
approximately what a CHP traffic officer makes after a similar period.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was good when I started, but it's much better now," Denning says. Good 
salaries and other benefits for state prison guards did not simply drop out of 
the sky. They are the result of the shrewd leadership of one of their own -- a 
former guard -- and a multibillion-dollar prison construction program that 
created a growing demand for guards. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Novey, the 46-year-old president of the California Correctional Peace 
Officers Assn., is known for his hard-nosed bargaining, tough-guy demeanor, 
belief in professionalism and a flair for PR. Novey wears a fedora, talks basic 
law and order and cultivates a bombastic Jimmy Hoffa image. But in interviews, 
the mustached, pink-cheeked union chief, a fifth-generation Californian, is 
soft-spoken and cautious about what he says. Novey doesn't possess high-voltage 
academic credentials -- he has an associate of arts degree from American River 
College in Sacramento -- but he is intelligent and erudite. Novey knows, for 
example, what Dostoevsky had to say about prison conditions, that they reflect 
society's values. He is a family man, with a wife of 23 years and three 
children. He speaks Polish and German and is learning Spanish. His office radio 
is tuned to a classical-music station. And he has learned how to tune into 
California's channels of power. 
</P>
<P>
 Novey has taken a small, listless public employees union and forged it into 
one of the most powerful political organizations in the state. He and the 
guards union pour millions of dollars into political campaign coffers. And, to 
the dismay of critics, they get results. For instance, the union helped put 
Republican Pete Wilson in the governor's office in 1990, spending nearly $1 
million. In 1992 -- the most recent year for which data is available -- the 
union's political action committee contributions to candidates were topped only 
by those from the powerhouse California Medical Assn. And the guards' largess 
wasn't restricted to Republicans that year. Its $60,000 contribution to the war 
chest of Democrat Willie Brown, the flamboyant and influential speaker of the 
Assembly, was the seventh-largest during his '92 reelection race. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1 million total to political campaigns in 1992 was only slightly more 
than the $992,000 handed out to politicians by the California Teachers Union, 
according to California Common Cause, which advocates campaign finance reform. 
But the guards, outnumbered 10 to 1 by the teachers, know how to get a better 
bang for their buck. 
</P>
<P>
 Common Cause says that the correctional officers' massive contributions have 
given them far too much power for a group of state employees. "They can exert 
this incredible influence to make sure they come out ahead in the salary game," 
maintains executive director Ruth Holton. "Why should one group of state 
employees have so much more influence than others simply because they happen to 
give more?" 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Vince Schiraldi, executive director of the Center on Juvenile and 
Criminal Justice, an organization that advocates alternatives to prison: "Why 
should we have the best-paid correctional officer staff in the country and not 
the best-paid teachers, professors, health-care workers and social service 
staff? It just proves that when the (guards union) said, 'Jump,' the 
Legislature and the governor said, 'How high?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Novey scoffs at such complaints, and needles the press for repeating them. 
"I've never seen the media attack the California Medical Assn., Arco, the 
California Trial Lawyers Assn. when they're doing the big spend," he says. "But 
once the little blue-collar worker gets up to the plate, everyone gets antsy." 
</P>
<P>
 IT IS AN EERIE SCENE: SEVEN HUNDRED WHITE COFFINS, EACH BEARING A red rose, 
are arranged row upon row on the lush grass next to the Capitol building in 
Sacramento. Several dozen people are seated on folding chairs adjacent to the 
coffins. A color guard of uniformed officers from the California Youth 
Authority reformatory at Preston marches down an aisle through the chairs. 
</P>
<P>
 In front of the gathering are several speakers, including Atty. Gen. Daniel 
Lungren and, wearing the ever-present fedora, Don Novey. The audience is from 
an organization of crime victims' families and the cardboard coffins represent 
California murder victims. This annual ceremony is sponsored by Novey's 
California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. It is only coincidental that, at 
dawn that spring day, Robert Alton Harris was executed in the gas chamber at 
San Quentin State Prison, the state's first execution in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren, a conservative law-and-order advocate, is subdued in his manner and 
remarks. He and Novey had been at the execution and look tired. But when Novey 
speaks, he is anything but subdued. He acknowledges that witnessing the 
execution was "difficult," but hastens to add, "The only thing I felt sorry for 
is that we had an open chair and I damn well would have liked to see Charlie 
Manson sitting in it alongside Robert Harris." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Novey describes Harris' death as though it had been an electrocution. 
"Extra crispy" is his flip comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Novey knows that the folks in front of him are not in a reflective mood. He 
knows they have just had a taste of vengeance and that it is their day to 
exult. Novey knows his audience. After all, it was he who helped create groups 
like this with funds from his union. It is good public relations for the union 
to support victims-rights groups and to espouse their causes, Novey knows, 
because he realized early on that California's prison guards could not ascend 
to real power on their numbers and dues alone. They also needed an image.  
</P>
<P>
 When Novey, fresh out of the Army, first walked through the medievally 
turreted East Gate of century-old Folsom Prison to work as a guard in 1971, he 
and his fellow officers were scorned by the public as lowly turnkeys. They 
didn't have proper uniforms, much less a training academy. "We'd come in cold," 
he recalls. "They'd hand you a set of keys and you were on your own." At some 
prisons, the rate of guard turnover was higher than 40% every two years.  
</P>
<P>
 After nine years as a guard at Folsom, Novey was convinced he could change the 
status of correctional officers. "I saw a group of people who were trying to do 
something right, but they were running into each other," he says of the union. 
"It just disturbed me." So he got himself elected president and hasn't lost a 
reelection yet.  
</P>
<P>
 At the time, recalls Novey, "It was just a good old boys club." There were 
2,000 members, the treasury held $25,000 and the organization operated out of a 
rented office. The top salary for guards was $21,000 a year.  
</P>
<P>
 Now there are 23,000 members in the union, including parole officers and 
medical technicians. Guard salaries have more than doubled since 1980, while 
monthly dues of $35 bring in around $9.5 million per year. Those funds were 
used to help build a $3-million Sacramento headquarters, a gleaming blue and 
white building with a large archway over the entrance and a grand staircase 
leading to Novey's comfortable, but by no means plush, office. 
</P>
<P>
 There he works constantly to polish the guards' image. It is a nasty business, 
going behind prison walls each day to keep others under lock and key. And it's 
an ironic calling, since those who do it become imprisoned themselves. Guards 
suffer long periods of numbing boredom, broken by instances of terror. And even 
now they generally get only slightly more respect than those they watch. 
Sometimes less. Almost everyone else in the criminal justice system gets a 
share of glamour: cops, prosecutors, defense attorneys, judges. In films, even 
convicts are depicted as colorful guys played by the likes of James Cagney and 
Clint Eastwood. 
</P>
<P>
 So Novey and his top staff spend about $500,000 a year on public relations. 
Union leaders insist that guards be called correctional officers. And Novey 
coined a slogan for their job: "the toughest beat in the state." Union 
representatives hand out "Tough Teddy" stuffed bears to kids during goodwill 
visits to hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in fact, prison work is not the toughest beat in the state. A Los Angeles 
police officer, for example, is far more likely to be killed on the job than a 
prison guard. During the past 30 years, 13 prison guards were killed. During 
the same period, the Los Angeles Police Department -- which is only about half 
the size of the prison guard force of 14,000-plus -- lost 63 officers in the 
line of duty. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the reality, but in the state Capitol, it's often the image that 
counts. "Ask any legislator in Sacramento," Novey says with a laugh. "They say, 
'Here they come, "The toughest beat in the state." ' " But a legislative aide 
who asked not to be identified disagrees. Prison guards want to consider 
themselves cops and be able to do cop-type things, like carry concealed weapons 
off-duty. "They're big-time wanna-bes," he says with a sneer.  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, guard training is inferior to that of many police departments. The 
six-week paramilitary course that new guards must complete offers classes 
ranging from report writing to hostage survival. But its six-week duration 
pales in comparison to the 6 1/2 months required by the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the union's track record under Novey has been remarkable. It 
helped establish a training academy in Northern California for guards and set 
up a lobbying office in Washington to push for national training standards for 
correctional officers. And benefits have certainly improved under Novey. Like 
most peace officers, for example, guards receive significantly better 
retirement benefits than other civil servants, such as better pensions at an 
earlier age. 
</P>
<P>
 NOVEY IS NOT HESITANT TO REWARD FRIENDS AND PUNISH ENEMIES IN the state 
Legislature in his pursuit of improving the welfare of his guards. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Elder, former Democratic assemblyman from Long Beach, frequently carried 
legislation on behalf of the union, including a bill to improve retirement 
benefits. The guards showed their appreciation by giving him $114,000 in 
campaign contributions from 1987 to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, Novey's method of building political influence is as subtle as the 
siren at Folsom Prison. Six years ago, for example, the union created a furor 
when it handed out personal gifts of $10,000 each to three politicians for 
their work in the state Legislature. One was Sen. Robert Presley (D-Riverside), 
chairman of the Joint Committee on Prison Construction and Operations. Presley 
says he considered the money an overly generous speaking fee. Another 
beneficiary was then-Assemblywoman Sunny Mojonnier (R-Encinitas), who left her 
sickbed to vote in favor of locating a prison in Los Angeles. The third check 
went to then-Sen H.L. Richardson (R-Glendora), well-known for his support of 
police and gun owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Such personal gifts to state lawmakers have since been banned, but legal 
campaign contributions by the guards continue. The union gave more than $3 
million to political campaigns in California from 1987 to 1992. And those who 
cross the guards can face retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 Take John Vasconcellos. The veteran Democratic assemblyman from Santa Clara 
has liberal ideas on crime and punishment, but he did, nevertheless, receive 
$7,250 from the guards between 1987 and 1990. Then Vasconcellos co-authored the 
ballot argument against a $450-million prison construction bond issue in 1990. 
Voters rejected the bonds, and the guards, in return, bankrolled the campaign 
of Vasconcellos' opponent, Tim Jeffries, in the Assembly race two years later. 
Vasconcellos won the election, but the union's $81,000 donation to Jeffries 
made what should have been a walkover a closer contest.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think it contaminates the system," Vasconcellos says of the union's 
methods. "People who do that think they can muscle the system."  
</P>
<P>
 The guards have indeed muscled the system into making prisons a sacred cow, 
contends Kim Alexander, former policy analyst for California Common Cause. 
"That kind of campaign funding has a chilling effect on the rest of the 
Legislature," she says. The chill has frozen out any serious consideration by 
Sacramento lawmakers of alternatives to building more prisons, reformers 
insist. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you've got is a powerful interest group invested in the status quo," a 
system built around prisons, says Barry Krisberg, president of the National 
Council on Crime and Delinquency, a criminal justice research organization 
based in San Francisco. "Change becomes difficult when every legislator is 
looking over their shoulder to see how this in-group is going to stand on their 
next election." 
</P>
<P>
 Krisberg's organization and others aren't convinced that prisons are the 
answer. They advocate alternatives such as intensely supervised parole programs 
for violent offenders and no parole supervision for lesser offenders, community 
corrections facilities and revised sentencing guidelines. Krisberg also 
advocates privately run prisons, which have been used sparingly in the state 
and are militantly opposed by the guards union. 
</P>
<P>
 Novey responds, tongue in cheek, that guards, too, are interested in reforms 
such as shorter sentences to reduce the prison population: "We've advocated for 
shorter sentences for a heinous crime: murder. We want state executions for 
Murder 1." 
</P>
<P>
 Not only the Legislature, but the governor, too, is chummy with Novey and the 
union leadership, critics say. Sometimes that relationship gets too close even 
for the union membership. Novey angered his rank and file as well as that of 
other state labor organizations in 1991 when he promised Gov. Wilson that his 
members would take a 5% pay cut. But Novey subsequently helped to drive a 
bargain with the Administration that allowed the guards to recoup wage 
reductions months before other civil servants who had taken a pay cut. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Alfred E. Alquist (D-San Jose) contends that Wilson is so beholden 
to the guards that he insisted last year's state budget contain increased funds 
for prison operations while all other departments suffered cuts. Alquist 
co-authored with Vasconcellos the 1990 ballot argument against prison bonds. 
Wilson responds that his decision to increase the prisons' budget during the 
state's financial crisis had nothing to do with the guards' political clout. 
And he stuck to his guns in his January budget proposals for this coming fiscal 
year. He recommended a 10% boost in the prison budget, about $335 million, and 
the hiring of 3,215 new guards to handle an anticipated 7% increase in the 
inmate population. Wilson also proposed a $2-billion bond issue to build six 
new prisons, subject to voter approval on the June or November ballot this 
year. Filling out his anti-crime package, which critics say is spurred by his 
reelection bid this year, Wilson supports the "three-strikes-and-you're-out" 
proposal, which would mandate life sentences to some repeat offenders. His 
enthusiasm has overreached even some of his key GOP allies, who oppose adding 
to the state's debt load. "We are unanimously opposed to any bonds for any 
reason," insists Senate Republican leader Ken Maddy of Fresno.  
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Novey argues that the guards union wants more prisons to relieve 
dangerous overcrowding, not to create more guard jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we want is access and the ability to explain our position," he says. 
"We're not going to run out there and demand that you pass a bill." He 
proclaims with a note of piety: "My goal in life -- and we'll never achieve it 
-- is for this profession not to exist. It's a sad reflection of our society 
that we have crime out there." 
</P>
<P>
 WHEN DON NOVEY STARTED WORK AT FOLSOM 23 YEARS AGO, IT WAS AN era of bloody 
prison uprisings. Convicts like George Jackson and the Soledad Brothers made 
headlines and California's prison system became notorious. "They were killing 
officers right and left," Novey says of the inmates of that time. 
</P>
<P>
 New officers weren't issued standard uniforms and, as a result, they stood out 
like the vulnerable green hands they were, he says. "It sort of identified you 
as fish bait to the inmates." After a nine-month probation, guards were allowed 
to wear regular olive-colored uniforms, but the outfits didn't include badges 
or state Department of Corrections arm patches, as they do now. 
</P>
<P>
 Novey's ascendancy to chief of the guards' union took place as California 
embarked on an unprecedented prison-building program. In 1982, there were 12 
state prisons and 6,300 guards. Twelve years and more than $5 billion later, 
there are 27 state prisons in operation, one more scheduled to open this month 
and the number of guards has more than doubled, to 14,388.  
</P>
<P>
 The rapid expansion of the 1980s occurred because California had long 
neglected its penitentiary system and state legislators were knocking each 
other over to introduce laws increasing prison sentences. Budget-minded critics 
warned that the state could not afford to build enough prisons. Nevertheless, 
the construction continued unabated, though it remained well behind the 
sentencing curve. By the early to mid-1980s, the prison system was bulging at 
155% of its design capacity. And still the number of inmates increased. 
</P>
<P>
 California's prison system, once the model of progressive penology nationwide, 
had become a string of stinking dungeons, dangerous for guards and lethal for 
convicts. Incidents of armed assaults among inmates rose from 200 to more than 
800 per year from 1978 to 1987. In 1987, 20 prisoners were killed by other 
inmates or by guards. Places like Deuel Vocational Institution in the little 
Central Valley town of Tracy became known as the Stabbing Capital of the World 
and the Gladiator School as gangbanger convicts carried on their outside wars 
inside the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Conditions at San Quentin and Folsom were aptly described by observers as a 
riot in slow motion. Inmates lived -- and still do live -- two to a 
closet-sized cell and were kept "on lock-down" -- confined to their cubicles 
nearly 24 hours per day -- much of the time. Yet the members of the warring 
Mexican Mafia, Black Guerilla Family, Aryan Brotherhood and Nuestra Familia 
managed to murder one another and attack their keepers. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, federal and Superior Court judges handed down decisions lambasting 
the state's prisons, especially San Quentin, for overcrowding, rampant 
violence, filth, rodent infestation and plumbing that leaked so badly that 
correctional officials considered issuing chamber pots to the inmates. Who 
would voluntarily enter such a place? 
</P>
<P>
 Nola Hearney did in 1983, when she was 22. She had just graduated with a 
degree in psychology, full of idealism and desperately in need of a job. The 
Department of Corrections needed guards at San Quentin. "I said, 'I'll go to 
San Quentin,' " recalls Hearney, one of the state's 2,300 women guards. " 'I've 
heard of that place.' "  
</P>
<P>
 Hearney is now an administrative assistant to the warden of Mule Creek State 
Prison. The new facility is a far cry from what Hearney encountered when she 
walked into San Quentin. "It was a foul place to work and the noise was 
deafening," she says of the state's oldest prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very intimidating environment," she explains. "Every day was a 
struggle, initially. They (the inmates) were deeply, deeply mentally ill and 
violent. They defiled you without even knowing you. I believed when I started 
with the department that everyone was inherently good and that, with enough 
concern, that good could be brought forth. I was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 The first person Hearney ever saw die was an inmate who had been stabbed by 
another convict and lay on a cold San Quentin floor with his life oozing away. 
"And another inmate spit on him while he was dying," she says. "I'd go home and 
cry. I thought, 'Is this what humanity has come to?' " 
</P>
<P>
 People who are locked up for long periods of time become ingenious at making 
things out of very little. Add rage and hopelessness and the items produced can 
be lethal. Prison officials say that convicts make a crude gunpowder, for 
example, from ground-up match heads. Something as innocuous as a newspaper is 
turned into a deadly spear by rolling it into a long tube and fitting it with a 
piece of metal that has been smuggled out of a shop and filed to a razor's 
edge.  
</P>
<P>
 A colleague of Hearney at San Quentin was jabbed in the eye with a prison-made 
spear. He survived. Another, Sgt. Howell Burchfield, was also speared. He died. 
The day before he was killed in 1985, Burchfield, a well-liked officer with an 
ironic sense of humor, had written in his diary: "I always wanted to be a cop 
or join the circus. Here I have both at San Quentin." 
</P>
<P>
 Novey keeps that quotation on the wall of his union headquarters office. 
Burchfield was the last state prison guard to be killed on duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Department of Corrections statistics indicate that the state prison system is 
not as dangerous as it used to be despite the current record level of 
overcrowding, now pushing 185% of design capacity. The number of assaults on 
staff members, though still in the hundreds, peaked in 1984, according to the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 Several theories are posed to explain the apparent reduction. For instance, 
court rulings in the 1980s forced the cleanup of San Quentin and Folsom as well 
as requiring more humane treatment of prisoners. Meanwhile, some of the more 
violent gang leaders are aging, their authority waning and their rage cooling. 
Get-tough-on-crime legislation also has diluted the violence quotient of the 
prison population by locking up an increasing number of less dangerous thieves 
and drug offenders. And as new prisons open, officials are able to isolate the 
most violent inmates in modern facilities and scrutinize their movements.  
</P>
<P>
 But even change is often controversial. For instance, a class-action lawsuit 
in federal court in San Francisco charges that inmates at the futuristic 
Pelican Bay State Prison are subjected to brutality by guards and isolation so 
complete that convicts are driven mad. Human Rights Watch and the American 
Civil Liberties Union issued a report in December contending that Pelican Bay 
prisoners are hogtied and made to lap up their food as disciplinary measures. 
Correctional officials acknowledge that some unruly inmates were tied in 
restraints several years ago, but insist that the practice has stopped. They 
deny the other allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 NOT LONG AGO AT MULE CREEK, the model prison where John Denning worked until 
recently, a cellblock guard momentarily let his attention drift. A prisoner 
bolted across the day-room floor and, at full stride, smashed his fist into the 
side of the officer's head, knocking him to the concrete floor. The guard now 
has a metal plate in his head.  
</P>
<P>
 Wary of such an occurrence, Denning, a six-year veteran, tries to tread a fine 
line with the inmates, staying alert without becoming mindlessly rigid. "These 
guys are my bread and butter," he says. "I'm going to treat them with respect, 
give them what they're entitled to under the law." 
</P>
<P>
 But he knows they will try to manipulate him. "They'll game you," he says. 
"These inmates know us better than we know each other. They have nothing to do 
24 hours a day but study us." Yet, like many guards, Denning rarely reads case 
files on inmates. "I don't want to know why they're here," he says. "You don't 
want to dwell on it because it might play mind games with you." 
</P>
<P>
 Denning, who has transferred to another prison, frequently worked in one of 
Mule Creek's raised, glassed-in booths that are equipped with control panels 
enabling him to open cell doors without coming into contact with prisoners. 
Because he has access to a firearm, no one in the cellblock below, including 
other guards, was allowed to enter his booth. When Denning needed something 
sent up, he lowered a plastic jug on a rope, the item was placed in the jug and 
he hauled it back up. "We have a state-of-the-art facility," he says with a 
smile. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the truly primitive, there is Folsom. In the oldest part of the 
penitentiary, which has been evolving cellblock by cellblock since 1880, 
correctional officer Dave Cruz takes sack lunches to the Latino prisoners who 
are on lock-down. They are confined because one of their number was stabbed and 
officials haven't yet determined why. That is the way prisons operate: a Latino 
is stabbed, lock down the Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz moves along the tiers and unlocks the cells so that inmates can open the 
solid steel plate doors that are set in ancient granite blocks. They reach out 
and pick up their lunches as the guard stands back and nudges the sacks toward 
them with his foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Cruz, 38, used to be in construction but became a guard eight years ago 
because he thought the law enforcement field was more stable than the building 
industry. He feels safer behind the walls of Folsom than he does on the street, 
but he has to remind himself to stay alert as he performs the monotonous task 
of passing out lunches. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like driving," he says. "Sometimes you get complacent. You don't 
pay as much attention as you should. Maybe an inmate gets some bad news and 
he'll take it out on the first person he meets. And it might be you." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, in a tiny exercise yard in a newer, but still antiquated part of the 
prison, Gregory Wilson -- unarmed except for a nightstick and a whistle -- 
stands among men whose arms and upper bodies are buffed out from pumping prison 
iron and whose bare torsos are covered with prison tattoos. 
</P>
<P>
 These men hold heavy metal weights in their hands and are within arm's length 
of Wilson, but the 46-year-old guard does not seem overly concerned. If they 
want to get you, he says, they'll get you, no matter where. 
</P>
<P>
 For Don Novey, it's been six years since he walked the line as a guard at 
Folsom, but sitting in his safe and comfortable office, he still remembers the 
feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "An officer on the line has got to survive on his wit and his whistle. It's 
like living in a city of convicted felons. And," the chief of the guards union 
hastens to add, "you should be duly rewarded for working the toughest beat."

FILM CLIPS: A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: WOULD THEY HAVE MADE 
'SCHINDLER' FOR 2 MIL -- AND IN COLOR? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Call it the "Schindler's List" that almost was. And some say thank God it 
wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Steven Spielberg's ambitious three-hour, 13-minute, black-and-white 
epic of the Holocaust unfurled on the silver screen, low-budget movie company 
Cannon Pictures supposedly planned to make a $2-million version in the late 
'80s. 
</P>
<P>
 "One can only imagine what the Cannon movie would have been like under a 
$2-million budget," said a former top Cannon executive who worked for the 
company's co-founder, Yoram Globus, at the time. (Spielberg's picture cost 
around $23 million and was shot in Poland.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Cannon is the (independent producer) who brought you 'The Happy Hooker Goes 
to Hollywood,' 'Death Wish III,' 'Texas Chainsaw Massacre II' and all of those 
'Delta Force' movies. The people who ran Cannon, especially in the early days, 
were considered the schlockmeisters of the film business," the executive added. 
"Thank God, Ladd (Alan Ladd Jr., then head of Cannon parent Pathe 
Communications) spotted it and killed it before it ever got made. We could have 
lost one of the best pictures of the last decade." 
</P>
<P>
 (Spielberg and his critically acclaimed film are favored to win best director 
and best picture Oscars this year.) 
</P>
<P>
 But Globus, a proud Israeli, claims that he never worked on any Schindler 
project and doesn't recall one ever being on Cannon's slate. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who worked for Globus and his cousin, Menahem Golan, back when they both 
ran Cannon, say they made movies of such prominent properties as "The Three 
Penny Opera," "A Cry in the Dark" and several Agatha Christie works, so it 
wasn't surprising that they would pursue a Schindler story. (It likely would 
have been filmed in Israel, where most of their movies were made.) 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Cannon wasn't the only one with designs on Schindler's story. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before screenwriter Steven Zaillian's script was ever delivered to 
Spielberg, "Casablanca" co-writer Howard Koch had penned a version in the early 
1970s of Oskar Schindler's life for MGM. Both the MGM script and aborted Cannon 
property (neither of which can be found) apparently centered on the focal point 
of Thomas Keneally's tome "Schindler's List" -- Oskar Schindler, a womanizing 
German war profiteer and Nazi Party member who saved 1,300 Jews from the Nazi 
death camps in Poland by hiring them at his enamelware factory. It was MCA 
Inc./Universal President Sidney Sheinberg who bought Keneally's book and sent 
it to Spielberg shortly after it was published in 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was Alan Ladd Jr., now an independent producer at Paramount Pictures, 
who came across the Schindler project on Cannon's future slate when he was at 
Pathe (which also for a brief time owned MGM). He immediately called Spielberg, 
a friend whom he knew had plans to do "Schindler's List." 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew this meant a lot to Steven," said Ladd, recalling that Spielberg was 
pretty upset when he heard about Cannon's plans. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early '70s, MGM had acquired rights to the Schindler story from his 
family's estate and had a deal that if Keneally wrote the book, the studio 
would get first crack at a screen adaptation. MGM retained control of the 
estate rights but eventually passed on buying Keneally's book. Even though 
MCA's Sheinberg bought the book rights for Spielberg, Universal kept extending 
the option from MGM every year until the film was finally made. 
</P>
<P>
 And the rest, as they say, is movie history.

CLINTON'S MIS-MANAGED CARE; DOCTORS CLAIM THEY ARE ALREADY SINKING UNDER A SEA 
OF RED TAPE. SOME INSIST IT WILL GET EVEN WORSE UNDER THE PROPOSED HEALTH-CARE 
PLANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dr. Jane M. Orient, Jane M. Orient is an internist in Tucson, Ariz. Her book 
Your Doctor Is Not In will be published in May by Crown. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In clamoring for "health-care reform now," the American public reminds me of 
the patient who comes to my office demanding to know "What's the matter, Doc?" 
and "What are you going to do to cure me?" before I even have a chance to say 
hello. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just a minute!" I have to say. Mere human beings like myself (doctors are not 
God, you know) have to start by taking a history and doing a physical exam. 
Only after making a diagnosis -- which they hope is the right diagnosis -- 
should doctors reach for the prescription pad. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes doctors have to tell patients that yes, there is a medicine that 
will make their heart stop "skipping beats" (suppress "PVCs" or premature 
ventricular contractions). The only problem is, the medicine that regulates the 
heartbeat might also stop it altogether. The majority of patients -- there's no 
room to explain the exceptions here -- would be better off to tolerate the 
aberrant beats. 
</P>
<P>
 In some patients with a complex history of seemingly unrelated symptoms, the 
most useful part of the examination might not be listening to the patient's 
chest but looking in the shopping bag filled with the patient's medicines. The 
first one might have been prescribed for the wrong diagnosis, the second for 
the side effects of the first, the third to counteract the interaction of the 
first two, and so on. And there might be some medicines that are causing 
idiosyncratic side effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, one can become a real medical hero very simply: Just stop all the 
medicines. ( Sometimes.)  
</P>
<P>
 This is not the same thing as stopping all treatment and abandoning the 
patient. Call it a diagnostic test to determine whether the treatment is worse 
than the disease, or whether it really is the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of our politicians hope to become heroes and get reelected by giving the 
American people a "Health Security Card." They remind me of myself when I was 
an internal medicine intern at Parkland Memorial Hospital in Dallas. I saw a 
man who had come to the Minor Medicine section of the emergency room because he 
had a cold. On listening to his heart, I detected bigeminy (every other beat 
was a PVC). The next thing he knew, the man was on a stretcher being whisked to 
Major Medicine to have an electrocardiogram. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know what happened to him after that. At the time, I thought I had 
made a dramatic save. But 20 years later, I am sure that that patient should 
have stayed home. There was nothing I could do to prevent his cold from turning 
into "double pneumonia," and there still isn't. But our heart medicines could 
have given him something worse. 
</P>
<P>
 Our treatment was given with the best of intentions and the most expert 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration tells us that its proposed Health Security Act was 
devised in consultation with prominent experts in the health-care field. But 
unlike the doctors at Parkland or any other hospital, these experts didn't have 
to put their signatures on the progress notes or the prescription. In fact, the 
Association of American Physicians and Surgeons and others had to sue the White 
House to find out the names of task force members, and, a year later, the White 
House is still trying to prevent the public from finding out who paid how much 
to whom to do what. Was the plan drafted by special-interest groups (such as 
big insurers, nonprofit foundations, vendors of information technology, 
bureaucrats) who stand to profit from it?  
</P>
<P>
 The secrecy of the Clinton Administration's Health Care War Room is one issue. 
The actual prescription is now out there for everyone to see -- all 1,300-plus 
pages of it. It has a lot in common with most of the other "health care reform" 
prescriptions before the U.S. Congress. It creates cartels, empowers 
bureaucrats and disenfranchises both patients and doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 These nostrums do not even consider the possibility that the patient -- the 
health-care system -- is the victim of the legal equivalent of polypharmacy 
(too many drugs): too much regulation, too much management, too many subsidies 
and too much of the wrong kind of insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 What if the chief symptom -- the outrageous cost of medical care -- is caused 
by laws that we already have? In that case, the answer is not to pass 1,300 
pages of new laws, but to repeal some of the old ones. It would be like 
stopping highly toxic drugs that are prescribed to "regulate" conditions that 
are best left alone. 
</P>
<P>
 The three proposals receiving the most attention are the Clinton Plan, managed 
competition, and single payer. The Clinton Plan would force all but the most 
fortunate citizens into government-controlled, bureaucratic health-care 
cartels. Managed competition, sponsored by Rep. Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.), is 
similar to the Clinton Plan but without price controls. The single payer is a 
Canadian-style government monopsony that forbids patients to pay directly for 
medical care. All are attempts to turn back the clock to failed systems like 
mercantilism and socialism, while the rest of the world (even Sweden) 
progresses toward privatization. Their vision is a nationalized health-care 
system, marching regularly in lock step under the direction of a central 
monolith. (The monolith, they imagine, will be under the direction of 
themselves and their buddies.) 
</P>
<P>
 People may swallow the deadly "health" potion because they have forgotten what 
medicine is about. 
</P>
<P>
 Medicine is about healing the sick and the injured. The heart of medicine is 
the relationship of one doctor to one patient. The patient is at the center of 
the universe. Not the "health-care delivery system" and its ruling bureaucracy. 
Patients don't march in lock step. Every one is unique. 
</P>
<P>
 When I see a patient, my job is to think about how to help that patient. Not 
to build a brave new world, or to save the planet, or to fight the War on Drugs 
or the War on Poverty or the War on Crime, or to save money so that the health 
plan managers can have a fancier cellular phone, or to achieve a set of social 
priorities that may require the sacrifice of that one patient.  
</P>
<P>
 WHEN I APPLIED TO MEDICAL SCHOOL, I WAS A FAIRLY typical candidate. I said the 
right things at my interview, like all the other applicants ("I like science, 
and I want to help people"). I had engaged in an extracurricular activity 
(debate team). But most important in the early 1970s, I had good, non-inflated 
grades. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical schools are now having second thoughts. Admitting people like me was 
evidently a mistake. The idea is to build "a new kind of doctor for the 21st 
Century," in the words of former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, now senior 
scholar at the C. Everett Koop Institute at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire, 
but more visible recently as an unofficial member of the Clinton plan 
entourage. His New Doctor is portrayed as a patient-friendly family physician.  
</P>
<P>
 Koop would change medical school curricula to prepare New Doctors, making 
them, for example, computer literate. But if this idea "doesn't catch," he told 
one reporter, he is prepared to "just push it."  
</P>
<P>
 The New Doctor is supposed to be full of humanitarianism and empty of greed. I 
do not know how to identify such a person in advance. All the aspirants that I 
interview for our local medical school seem to be nice, idealistic young 
people. Not one has ever told me that he wanted to go to medical school to get 
rich. (I tell them that if they want to achieve financial security in these 
uncertain times, they should consider another field.)  
</P>
<P>
 How do others, such as Dr. Koop, look into the students' souls? They can't do 
it any better than the interviewers of the last generation, who were also 
looking for good moral character and humanitarianism. What they can do is 
demean academic achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 Although medical school is reputedly a miserable experience, I had a wonderful 
time. I thought neuroanatomy and biochemistry were fascinating. I was angry at 
the innovators who shortened the gross anatomy curriculum to less than half a 
year. That wasn't nearly enough time to learn all that I thought I needed to 
know. 
</P>
<P>
 But Koop told the New Physician magazine in December that a medical student 
doing "respite care and helping a family through a health problem, for example, 
is ever so much more important than learning certain intricacies about the 
anatomy of the hand that you'll never use in your life." But if I'm a patient 
with an injured hand, I want my family doctor to know all about extensor 
tendons. I don't want him to miss a diagnosis. If he makes a lot of money, 
that's good. I want him to be committed to medicine, not pursuing a sideline 
business to put bread on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients may disagree about the type of doctor they want to see. To some, 
willingness to abide by government regulations and take the government fees 
override all else. One of my patients was furious when she found out that I was 
no longer willing to accept money from Medicare.  
</P>
<P>
 "I paid my taxes," she said. "Now those doctors should have to take care of 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked whether her husband, a barber, should have to give $2 haircuts to 
all who met government eligibility standards, she said, "that's different." 
(Actually, I have treated many poor people at a price they could afford -- by 
mutual choice.) 
</P>
<P>
 All patients, poor or rich, are also said to want more family physicians, just 
as the would-be central planners think they should. Medical students, however, 
are turning away from family practice and internal medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a lot of personal reasons for preferring one specialty over another. 
Some choose pediatrics because they don't like old people. Some choose internal 
medicine because they can't stand screaming babies. Some choose 
non-patient-care specialties like radiology because they don't much like 
patients. Some opt for highly paid specialties because they like the field -- 
or because they are deeply in debt. So what should we do if not enough students 
choose to follow the socially desired path? Just push? (The Clinton Plan has 
lots of coercive provisions related to medical education: For example, some 
physicians who are gifted in a specialty such as orthopedics will not be 
allowed to qualify in their field of interest if that field already has its 
nationwide quota of residents. They would have to study something else.)  
</P>
<P>
 Koop's New Doctor is supposed to be more "caring." In fact, I think the New 
Doctor will be just as human as the old ones but will care less about certain 
things: He or she won't mind being pushed around. Actually, she will have a 
whole different perception. What I call being "pushed around" may seem entirely 
normal and acceptable, and resistance or noncompliance may be called disruptive 
and divisive and even antisocial.  
</P>
<P>
 Here are some examples of managed-care and Medicare situations that are 
pushing Old Physicians right out of the profession: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Spending hours on hold waiting to talk to a clerk. Doctors have to explain 
why a patient needs an operation to someone who may never have heard of the 
procedure. That anonymous someone has the power to deny insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Being forced to work under a Medicare fee schedule devised by Harvard 
economist William Hsiao. He purports to know how many hours of psychotherapy 
equal a dislocated toe, but he is blissfully ignorant about rent, the cost of 
supplies and liability insurance premiums. The fee schedule is infallible -- 
there is no appeal. (Under Medicare, doctors who "overcharge" by as little as 
51 cents may have to pay fines of $2,000. The Clinton Plan and some others 
would extend governmental price fixing to all medical services and supplies.) 
</P>
<P>
 3. Having to answer threat letters from bureaucrats. Going to see a sick 
patient in the hospital -- and billing for it -- often brings an accusatory 
letter from Medicare, especially if a consultant also saw the patient the same 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Being constantly in a fight. Doctors who happen to see many patients with 
potentially serious problems can choose between fighting with their conscience 
or with the powers that control their livelihood. 
</P>
<P>
 Coping agreeably in the New World will require both New Doctors and New 
Patients, not the kind we had at Parkland, which received a constant stream of 
the most "disadvantaged" patients in society -- poor, unwashed, often 
illiterate and "low sick." One such patient asked a highly outmoded question: 
"You the doctor?" 
</P>
<P>
 He wanted to see somebody with the responsibility and the authority to do 
something about his illness. Not a lady with a clipboard. Not a committee. Not 
a patient advocate or representative. Not a social worker. He was waiting to 
see the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Parkland resident, who was no doubt very tired, fielded the question 
expertly by firing back another one: "You the patient?" 
</P>
<P>
 It has been said that "the patient is the one with the disease" (Law IV in 
"The House of God," an irreverent novel by Samuel Shem). It is also written: 
"They that are whole have no need of the physician." A patient and a doctor: 
one on one. Singular, not plural. 
</P>
<P>
 Some call that a "disease orientation," as opposed to a "wellness" 
orientation. The focus is on the sick individual, not on society's well-being. 
</P>
<P>
 Will we have a New System in which there is "universal access" to "health 
care" that is "delivered" by various "health-care providers," including New 
Doctors and mid-level rationers? What will that mean to a patient -- a sick 
person -- who is waiting to see the doctor? 
</P>
<P>
 AT THE SAME TIME REFORMERS say we need universal access to health care, they 
complain that in the United States we have too much access to medical care, 
especially high-tech services for the seriously ill. This is irrational, they 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 One model for reformers is the Oregon Health Plan: a scheme for explicitly 
rationing medical care. A group of Oregonians labored for 20,000 hours and 
finally delivered a list of some 700 health services, ranked in order of social 
utility -- the greatest good for the greatest number. The idea is for the 
Legislature to draw a line, based on budgetary constraints. Services above the 
line are covered under Medicaid, and those below the line are simply 
unavailable to Medicaid patients. (Medicaid patients are the experimental 
subjects; the idea is to later extend a similar program to all.) 
</P>
<P>
 The list has a wellness orientation. Near the top are preventive services (No. 
141 for children and No. 74 for adults). Much farther down are certain 
treatments for conditions that the "preventive" services might uncover. In 
pediatrics, we were taught always to check for a congenitally dislocated hip. 
In Oregon, the social value of surgical hip reconstruction was ranked No. 552 
in 1991. It has now been changed to No. 85, which is still considered less 
valuable than a general checkup for an adult. Treatments to improve problems 
caused by cerebral palsy range from Nos. 203 to 425. Not very many people have 
those conditions, so the societal benefit from treating them is small. Also, 
many treatments do not restore the patient to a normal condition, so, in the 
view of people who don't suffer from the problem, treatment isn't worth the 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The new "compassion" is the opposite of old-fashioned charity. Charity means 
that those who are better off choose to help those who are less fortunate. The 
new compassion means that the healthy are literally to take resources away from 
the sick and the disabled (through the intervention of a third party, of 
course). 
</P>
<P>
 Resources are always scarce. Therefore, there must be some method of 
allocating them. (Many, including Hillary Rodham Clinton, call that 
"rationing," but I use the R-word to mean forcible allocations by the 
government, which has the power to say, "You can't have that even though it is 
available and you can afford it or someone else will help you pay.") 
</P>
<P>
 Today, decisions about medical care are the product of complex interactions of 
individuals -- including patients, some of whom are so desperate that they will 
spend themselves into bankruptcy pursuing pain relief or a reprieve from 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients, in the view of academic physicians and many other reformers, are not 
to be trusted to make decisions for themselves. As Rep. Pete Stark (D-Oakland), 
one of the most powerful players in the reform debate, explained to an audience 
of managed-care administrators, patients either consider themselves 
"invincible" when feeling well or they are "absolutely irrational, brain dead, 
sniveling, begging, and fantasizing ills and pains." So who is to make 
decisions? Surely not physicians, who are all supposed to be evil and 
avaricious. Instead, there is to be a new class of policy-makers, decision 
makers, managers, medical directors, and ombudsmen. I call them wonks, 
bureaucrats and pooh-bahs now, but the New Doctor will have to be more 
respectful. 
</P>
<P>
 To see the result, we do not need a crystal ball. We can buy a Canadian 
newspaper. At times, hospitals there buy ads begging for charitable 
contributions so they can obtain a defibrillator (the device used to restart 
the heartbeat in patients who have an "acute dying spell" due to ventricular 
fibrillation, a complication of heart attacks). There are numerous articles 
about the crisis of rising costs, even as hospital wings are being closed by 
provincial governments and patients wait months or years for potentially 
lifesaving surgery. There are also plenty of examples from the U.S. side of the 
border. Visit the waiting room of your local VA. I used to work at one -- part 
of my job was to certify that veterans who had waited all day didn't really 
need medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Or try to find a copy of the secret contracts signed by doctors who work for 
some managed-care entities. They may have promised not to say anything critical 
about their plan. Also, they might have agreed to take a pay cut if too many 
patients received too much care. The plans refer to family doctors and 
internists as "gatekeepers." The idea is the same as at the county hospital, 
where the interns used to say, "Put a rock at the front door." 
</P>
<P>
 WHEN I EMERGED FROM the bureaucratic morass at the VA and went into solo 
private practice, I made an astonishing discovery. When I called a consultant 
about a patient, he said "thank you" instead of something unprintable. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical community was a vibrant one. The prevailing attitude was "Yes I 
can." (At the VA, it was "Oh no you can't.") We knew we could never defeat 
death or restore perfect health; the idea was to think of something that would 
help as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The physicians' purpose was easy to understand and was right out of the 
Hippocratic Oath: "I will prescribe regimen for the good of my patients 
according to my ability and my judgment and never do harm to anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors could enjoy the fruits of their long years of study. They had respect. 
Patients appreciated them and brought in homemade jelly, pickles and tamales. 
As the Hippocratic Oath states, "While I continue to keep this oath unviolated, 
may it be granted to me to enjoy life and the practice of the art, respected by 
all men and in all times." 
</P>
<P>
 Things are different now. A literal translation of the Hippocratic Oath is 
used in only 6% of U.S. medical schools, and a modified version in 42%. 
Instead, many New Doctors take oaths that emphasize their responsibility to 
society with its social ills and delete the inconvenient moral absolutes, such 
as "do no harm to anyone."  
</P>
<P>
 The oath concludes with "may the reverse be my lot" (if I swerve from the Oath 
or violate it). 
</P>
<P>
 Could that be the reason why many physicians are so embittered and unhappy? 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Plan stands the Hippocratic Oath on its head by making all 
physicians' judgment subject to that of the omnipotent, infallible National 
Health Board of non-physicians. It mandates a stiff dose of harm to many people 
-- not just those who will be forced to pay for it, but the patients whose 
medical treatment will be delayed, denied or reduced in quality. It completes 
the process that has already started with the intimate involvement of third 
parties (including government and insurers and other big corporations).  
</P>
<P>
 No more homemade jelly. That might be construed as a bribe or gratuity. The 
plan will result in severe rationing; people will inevitably become desperate 
to, say, get their child into a hospital. But if they offer to pay additional 
money to the hospital or the doctor, that is a bribe, and the exchange of 
anything of value (I wonder if that includes respect) to influence the delivery 
of medical services would be a criminal offense. The penalties include five, 
10, 15 years in prison. If a patient dies, a doctor who had violated one of the 
rules could be jailed for life. But patients are subject to jail terms also, as 
for offering bribes or simply for withholding information from a health 
alliance (that carries a five-year sentence).  
</P>
<P>
 Incredible as it seems, many medical associations have endorsed the Clinton 
Plan -- at least their leaders have. Perhaps many of the profession's leaders, 
deep down in their hearts, share Rep. Stark's opinion of their patients. They 
think they are much smarter than the patient in medical matters, even if the 
patient is capable of designing a computer.  
</P>
<P>
 My prescription is basically this: We need to empower patients, not 
bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
 All patients, of course, need medical advice. Today, they can choose whether 
to seek advice, and from whom, and whether to take the advice. The Clinton plan 
will circumscribe those choices for everybody. According to Dr. Daniel Johnson 
Jr., speaker of the AMA House of Delegates, private practice will be destroyed 
by Clinton's reforms.  
</P>
<P>
 The single most important element of any reform is its effect on freedom. True 
freedom is not the same thing as "choice" -- especially if "none of the above" 
is not one of the lawful choices. And to exercise freedom, patients need to 
retain control of their money. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients should not be forced to spend money on compliance with current 
regulations that protect us against trivial risks. One rule made by the 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration requires a complicated paper 
trail for disposing of materials, such as a soiled diaper or sanitary napkin, 
that individuals can send to the landfill without a second thought. Paper 
trails require paper sentries: The hospital might not have a nurse to answer 
your call button, but they surely have a whole wing of administrative staff for 
complying with Medicare, insurance and OSHA rules. I cannot find out for sure 
what percentage of your hospital charges go to support this staff, but I've 
seen estimates of 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients should also spend their money themselves rather than turning it over, 
in advance, to a middleman. At present, less than 25% of all medical costs are 
paid directly by the person receiving the service. The other 75% passes through 
the hands of a middleman first -- an insurer or the government -- and a lot of 
it sticks to his fingers. Big insurers today don't want to take risks. They 
want to profit from managing your money. 
</P>
<P>
 If you put your money in the bank instead of into an insurance company, it 
draws interest. Also, when you write a check, the bank just pays up. When you 
submit a claim to an insurer or the government, you always have a delay and 
often a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons want health alliances to control all the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients should say "no way." They should take the amount they are now 
spending on premiums and put about half of it in a special savings account. 
With the rest, they should buy a low-cost, high-deductible "catastrophic" 
policy, as opposed to a prepayment plan for consumption of medical services. 
(Some insurance companies don't want you to do that because it is less 
profitable than high-pay, low-deductible plans.)  
</P>
<P>
 If most people did this, I predict that medical costs would plummet, care 
would improve, and the economy would boom, providing productive work for the 
newly unemployed paper shufflers. (They could answer call buttons in truly 
competitive hospitals, for example.) 
</P>
<P>
 There is already overwhelming evidence of the superiority of privatization 
compared to central planning. The early results of a few experiments are highly 
favorable. Since 1989, a utility holding company in Richmond, Va., has offered 
a high-deductible, low-cost insurance plan. Employees who choose the plan, as 
75% do, get to keep the money that is not used in meeting their deductibles. 
Medical costs have increased only 1% a year since the plan's inception. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm for doing more such experiments.  
</P>
<P>
 How about the advocates of the Clinton Plan? Will they agree to a competitive 
test? Or will they insist on universal coercion to implement a universal plan? 
Will they really listen to the patient (American medicine) before making a 
diagnosis? Or will they rush the patient to the operating room, saw through the 
breastbone and pour ice on the heart, without even bothering to charge their 
defibrillator?

FILM CLIPS: A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: SILLY SEASON; OSCAR LONG 
SHOTS THAT ARE SPELLED 'LOOOOOONG SHOTS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 They typically open: "For Your Consideration." But the response to these ads 
for Oscar nominees isn't always the desired one. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Walt Disney Pictures' latest in the Hollywood entertainment trade 
papers: "Leon. Best Actor. 'Cool Runnings.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Remember Leon? Remember "Cool Runnings"? 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Leon is up against such potential best actor nominees as Harrison Ford 
("The Fugitive"), Anthony Hopkins ("The Remains of the Day") or Daniel 
Day-Lewis ("In the Name of the Father"), to name a few.  
</P>
<P>
 This is no slam against the bobsled movie or Leon, who's driving it. It's 
merely an example of what some studio executives refer to as Hollywood's 
"political waste." And it comes bubbling up this time every year. 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't matter whether the picture is a hit at the box office or with the 
critics. What matters is that actors' and actresses' egos are massaged and 
studios' relationships with them are greased so that they will star in future 
films. That's critical since most studios are constantly vying for a select 
group of talent. Besides, if they don't take out the ads for notable actors, 
they'll be dogged by the stars' agents. 
</P>
<P>
 So the long-shot (or what some in the business snidely refer to as "suicide") 
ads become a costly necessity at Oscar time. Advertisers say they pay $5,869 
for a one-page ad in four colors in the Hollywood Reporter for one day. A 
two-page ad costs $11,300. Studios and independent filmmakers plunk down those 
bucks throughout the Academy Awards season, which runs from January to the big 
night, March 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the greenbacks doled out for Bill Murray as best actor for "Groundhog 
Day" or Sylvester Stallone for "Demolition Man"? Or Stallone in "Cliffhanger"? 
("You might as well light a candle and pray to St. Jude," quipped one Columbia 
source and academy voter.) 
</P>
<P>
 Or the money spent on just about every category for TriStar's "Rudy"; 
director, actor and screenplay for Hollywood Pictures' "Bound by Honor"; best 
picture -- and all the other categories -- for both Columbia's "Malice" and 
20th Century Fox's "Rookie of the Year." 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe these people think they can fool the public, but the people in the 
industry? They're the ones who vote on the nominations, for Pete's sake!" says 
a Universal Pictures production executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Fine Line Features' "Short Cuts," which has seen a media blitz of advertising, 
is considered a long shot -- but Fine Line's campaign, sources say, is also 
designed to try to raise its visibility in the film community to attract more 
directors like Robert Altman. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, many voting members said they found Touchstone's Oscar 
nominee ads for Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne in "What's Love Got to Do 
With It" -- who are considered genuine contenders -- underwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
 When studios or independent producers have dropped the ball on long-shot ad 
campaigns, talent has been known to tout themselves, such as Diane Ladd for a 
nomination in 1991's "Rambling Rose." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there are the foreign-language films. "Many of these pictures are 
only shown for very brief periods of time in Los Angeles and New York and the 
academy members miss them. The trade ads induce them to go," says entertainment 
attorney David Colden, of Weissmann, Wolff, Bergman, Coleman & Silverman. 
"While many of these pictures are strong on their merit, there are some smaller 
companies with obscure pictures who think if they spend enough money and take 
out enough ads, they can buy a vote. Now that's naivete." 
</P>
<P>
 But for the big boys, it's an exercise in showmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you know what's so ridiculous?" said one Paramount producer and academy 
member. "People are running all of these ads, when you know 'Schindler's List' 
is going to win best picture and director. The one that gets me is the ad for 
(Columbia's) 'Geronimo' for best picture. Give it up."

 Back in the days of vinyl, the Beatles' "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club 
Band" won a Grammy Award for Best Album Cover. If it were released today -- on 
compact disc -- fans would need a magnifying glass to make out all 69 faces on 
the cover. 
</P>
<P>
 With their "canvas" shrunk to fit a CD jewel box, designers have little, if 
any, room for error. Type that was easy to read on an album becomes just so 
many hieroglyphics. Band names and album titles not printed at the top of 
covers sink in the sea of CD store displays. And forget intricate illustrations 
and tiny photos (see "Sgt. Pepper's"); the new look is simple yet arresting 
images in high-contrast colors. 
</P>
<P>
 "A cover should be interesting and readable and explosive. You want it to jump 
off the rack," says Chuck Beeson, a senior art director at A&M Records. "If you 
can make someone pick it up and hold it in their hands, then you've done your 
job." 
</P>
<P>
 While designing a CD cover is exacting, it's also liberating, prompting 
designers to try new riffs on old themes. "We always have to look for something 
new and fresh. That's the challenge. Everyone's trying to push the medium," 
says Tommy Steele, vice president of art and design at Capitol Records. Which 
is why recent releases have featured computer typefaces and graphics, 
recyclable papers and organic inks, and innovative uses of materials such as 
wood, metal, even holograms and gel-filled plastic bags. 
</P>
<P>
 Creativity is most conspicuous in special packages. For a few dollars more 
than the price of a regular CD, listeners get their favorite music and a 
collectible visual treat -- for instance, Tina Turner's "Foreign Affair," which 
resembled a passport, and Bonnie Raitt's "Luck of the Draw," a takeoff on a 
deck of cards. Both are a far cry from the very first Best Album Cover award 
winner in 1958, Frank Sinatra's "Only the Lonely," for which Old Blue Eyes 
himself was credited as art director. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 Grammy nominees for Best Recording Package, shown here, were chosen 
from about 350 entries by art directors around the country. None, it's worth 
noting, is the standard-issue jewel box. That's why designers want the National 
Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences to create separate categories for regular 
releases and the more spectacular special projects. Until then, competition -- 
the winner will be named March 1 -- remains keen, if a little skewed. Says 
Steele: "There's a great selection of goodies. Usually, I find one or two and 
think, 'God, how did that get in there?' But this year, I don't have any 
questions at all." 
</P>

<P>
 R.E.M.'s "Automatic for the People" 
</P>
<P>
 (Reprise) 
</P>
<P>
 Art director Tom Recchion (nominated with band member Michael Stipe and art 
directors Jeff Gold and Jim Ladwig): "The package was meant to focus in on 
photos of the group by Anton Corbijn, but I wanted to present them in an 
unusual way. In talking with Michael Stipe, we came up with putting lyrics on 
the photos. We wanted to make something that, the more time you spent with it, 
the more you discovered. I tried doing them in varnish because I wanted the 
lyrics to be ghost-like, to take your eye by surprise. But we had so many 
problems realizing this idea that I ended up with a metallic ink at different 
percentages on vellum. Jeff Gold had a wooden box lying around, and Jim Ladwig 
found the people who could blind-emboss the title on wood. We did that to play 
up the whole idea of things not quite being there. The band is very conscious 
of the ecology, so the disc comes out of a brown sleeve. It's a natural paper 
that has a nice, commonplace, low-tech feel to it. And the natural-cotton 
ribbon was a way to get the contents out of the box. I wanted the disc to be 
the only electronic, plasticky thing in the box." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Westerberg's "14 Songs" 
</P>
<P>
 (Sire/Reprise) 
</P>
<P>
 Art director Kim Champagne: "We decided to re-create the book on the cover of 
the regular package, so we used the same typography and some of the same 
photos. The idea was to make something very intimate because Paul Westerberg is 
a very no-frills, very humble and simple guy. We didn't want it to be too 
froufrou or overdesigned, so we used inexpensive materials and not a lot of 
color. But we did use green on the binding because it's Paul's favorite color. 
Paul and I went on a field trip to bookstores, where we looked at book covers 
and pulled some things that had the right attitude. Frank Ockenfels did most of 
the photography, but I took the photograph on the disc myself. I chose it 
because it had a nice mood to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Art director Jeff Gold: "Bill Bentley did an interview with Paul that not many 
people saw, so we decided to include the whole interview. Because the title is 
'14 Songs,' I thought every page should be page 14. And I had the idea to have 
some extra pages at the end of the book labeled 'Notes.' We knew the book 
should look old and handcrafted because Paul's music is very much handcrafted. 
It has the soul that an old book would have." Billie Holiday's "The Complete 
Billie Holiday on Verve 1945-1959" Art director David Lau: "From the beginning, 
we wanted something that looked old and had a vintage look to it. When we did 
the CD holders, we tried to mimic the old 45 sleeves. The colors on the discs 
were taken from the old record labels. As far as the box goes, we wanted to 
reflect her music -- mellow and mysterious. I wanted to use a varnish so that 
Billie Holiday's image on the box would be black on black, but that was too 
subtle: You had to tilt the box to see it. So we used a gray image instead. My 
first idea for the book was to make a scrapbook, but there wasn't enough time. 
It took almost half a year to finish the whole job because this book is not a 
normal CD booklet. It was very expensive to print 220 pages of information and 
photography, a lot of it by Herman Leonard, a big jazz photographer back then. 
Most of the photos were black and white, so I added tints and didn't run type 
over people's faces. I used the photo of the gardenia to break up each section 
because it was Billie Holiday's trademark." Ozzy Osbourne's "Live & Loud" 
</P>
<P>
 (Epic) 
</P>
<P>
 Art director David Coleman: "Epic wanted to do a unique package to commemorate 
Ozzy's final tour. One of the concepts we came up with was this speaker grill. 
It seemed perfect for Ozzy's heavy-metal, high-decibel sound. We wanted it to 
look like an actual speaker; that's why I superimposed his face behind the 
metal grill and put his name on the plaque. There was no need to put any other 
graphics on the front. We ended up wrapping the box with a black stock with a 
nice grain. It was supposed to simulate the grain of leather on an industrial 
speaker. We also included two color tattoos that Ozzy, in fact, has on his own 
body. These were the signature tattoos: the O-Z-Z-Y on his fingers and the 
dragon. We also had a 24-page color booklet. I tried to capture the feeling of 
the tour and the story of Ozzy. I wanted a cross-section of photos, everything 
from tour mementos such as guitar picks, ticket stubs, parts of the itinerary. 
I wanted to take the fans on the tour." Pink Floyd's "Shine On" 
</P>
<P>
 (Columbia) 
</P>
<P>
 Art director Storm Thorgerson (nominated with Stylorouge): "The first thing we 
did was decide to have a proper book, hardback, lots of information and all the 
photographs and designs used previously. And that's what Stylorouge did. It's 
very solid and a good read. Eight CDs come in the box, one for each of the 
seven albums, except for 'The Wall,' which is a double album. There's also a 
bonus CD in a Digipak for the early singles. All the CDs come in a solid-black 
jewel box with an album cover that looks like a small postage stamp stuck on. 
When you put them together on the shelf, all the spines make up a design, 'The 
Dark Side of the Moon' cover. It's a way to keep them in order. We also 
enclosed postcards to give people something to put somewhere else. Each 
postcard is an album cover. Aside from sending them to friends, you can pin 
them to the wall. The silver logo is made up of seven letters for the seven 
albums; a triangle, because that's associated with 'Dark Side of the Moon,' and 
circles or planets, because Pink Floyd is kind of spacey. The album titles were 
all printed over each other to look like old script. This logo is a bit like a 
secret map: If you were to look into this secret map, you might find the secret 
to the universe. Or maybe not. The most important image is the one on the front 
of the box. All these figures are being elevated out of the water, which is 
what happens when you listen to Floyd music, I think. It lifts you out of the 
ordinary." EMILY YOUNG

FILM CLIPS: A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: SHORTING 'CUTS'; AND DON'T 
FORGET TO NOMINATE THOSE WRITER GUYS

 Fine Line Features' President Ira Deutchman might want to practice what he 
preaches. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent letter to members of the Writers Guild of America promoting Robert 
Altman's movie "Short Cuts," Deutchman stresses how the "contribution of the 
screenwriter is one of the most difficult to assess and therefore frequently 
overlooked." 
</P>
<P>
 He urges members not to forget the "amazing" work of those who adapted Raymond 
Carver's short stories for "Short Cuts" -- which New York-based Fine Line is 
distributing -- yet manages to commit the same sin of omission he left-handedly 
is accusing the industry of sometimes doing. 
</P>
<P>
 While he remembers to quote a couple of critics' favorable remarks about the 
film in his letter, Deutchman himself never mentions the adapters' names 
anywhere . (They are Altman and Frank Barhydt.) 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just so typical -- they manage to insult us even when they're trying 
to suck up to us," said a WGA member. (Both the WGA and Oscar nominations are 
due this week.) 
</P>
<P>
 When reached for comment, Deutchman admitted his boo-boo. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to send out a letter of apology . . . it was just an oversight," 
he said.

 At first, you keep them in stacks. Then the stacks become rows, and then the 
rows take over the bookcase. And pretty soon, you're looking for storage units 
to house all the CDs in your music collection.Plastic and black metal have been 
your choices until recently. Now CD racks are fashioned from aluminum, steel 
and exotic woods. Some storage towers sport bases of marble and tops shaped 
like fanciful pianists or heraldic banners. Others are made of woods with 
beautiful grains or industrial-cut aluminum that resembles giant combs. Artist 
Aidan Bird's aluminum "Birdrax" CD tower is so graceful that one interior 
designer purchased it for use strictly as sculpture rather than storage. Says 
Bird: "People spend a couple of thousand dollars on CDs -- they might as well 
have a nice thing to show them off." BARBARA THORNBURG

RESTAURANTS; BEEFED UP; WHAT'S FULL OF FAT AND COSTS ABOUT $13 AN OUNCE AT THE 
NEW OTANI HOTEL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Charles Perry 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wagyu beef, the famous Japanese beef from Kobe, is so marbled with fat it's a 
deep, mottled pink. It would probably scare your doctor right out of his socks. 
It might scare you, too, if you have a problem with the idea of paying $156 for 
a 12-ounce filet -- a la carte. But that's the going rate at the Garden Grill 
in the New Otani Hotel, and believe it or not, it's probably less than you'd 
pay in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, you could order seafood here, but what's the point? The Garden Grill is 
for dropping a bundle in order to spend time in the lap of luxury, 
Japanese-style. A kimono-clad hostess glides you across the black marble floor 
toward one of three polished granite tep pan tables, two with views of the 
hotel's rooftop Japanese garden, the third screened off from the rest of the 
world. After you order, a waitress discreetly ties an apron around your neck. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a teppan-yaki restaurant, meaning a chef cooks everything on a griddle 
built into the table, but there's no showy chopping and flinging, 
Benihana-fashion, and everything is cooked to order -- he doesn't wait until a 
table is full to start cooking. In fact, if you're planning to taste a bit of 
what one of your dinner partners is eating, he'll even cook that portion 
separately to your instructions. Altogether, you feel adequately pampered for 
the money you're paying; this may explain why the restaurant attracts big 
spenders, such as the group of Japanese and American shopping center developers 
who shared a table with me one night.  
</P>
<P>
 You can order a la carte, but the basic idea is to choose one of the prix-fixe 
meals (which differ only slightly in their courses) and then decide how much 
steak you want to include. It doesn't have to be Wagyu beef; there's also 
excellent domestic Black Angus. One difference is that the domestic beef is 
$3.25 to $3.50 an ounce (you read that right: not $3.50 a pound but $3.50 an 
ounce ), depending on whether you want New York or filet, while the Wagyu runs 
$11 to $13 an ounce. 
</P>
<P>
 On the table are chopsticks, a napkin and a little square plate. As the chef 
starts to work, slicing and frying, you get a lacquered bowl of miso soup with 
seaweed and tofu cubes in it, a simple green salad, some rice mixed with bits 
of carrot and green onion and a little plate of relishes: pickled ginger, 
sweetish pickled yellow radish and sliced cucumber. 
</P>
<P>
 When the chef's got something ready for you, he puts it on a serving plate set 
on the edge of the teppan grill. This means that to get your hot food, you have 
to reach pretty far over, with chopsticks well extended. Learn to master this. 
The serving plate is where it is so that the food will stay warm. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the chef has finished cooking anything, though, you'll have been served 
the cold appetizers that come on your prix-fixe meal. On the Winter Menu, for 
instance, you get a shrimp cocktail -- big, very fresh shrimp, a good, 
tomato-based cocktail sauce and an intricately cut ornamental carrot on the 
side for fun. If you ordered the $58 Tachibana dinner, you choose either 
boiled, thin-sliced halibut with ponzu sauce, assorted hors d'oeuvres, a 
sashimi assortment or Wagyu beef sashimi (yes, raw $11-per-ounce beef). 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, if you ordered the $38 Kaede dinner, you get a plate of 
seasonal appetizers. Mine were thin-sliced raw halibut rolled up in a thin 
omelet, strongly flavored with ginger; chewy raw calamari, also heavy on the 
ginger; an oblong of rich orange fish roe, a dense slice of boiled chicken 
breast and a cube of fish-flavored gelatin in the shape of a maple leaf, 
complete with changing fall colors (how seasonal can you get?). 
</P>
<P>
 By now there are a couple of sauces on your tray, such as vinegar, lemony 
ponzu sauce (which you can doctor with minced radish) and a light and very good 
fresh barbecue sauce. The chef has been frying bok choy, onions, garlic slices, 
a slice each of kabocha pumpkin and very starchy Japanese sweet potato, and 
various mushrooms: maybe oyster mushrooms, shiitake and golden chanterelles. 
He's been giving you samples of them and of fish, abalone and  
</P>
<P>

 And now it's the moment of truth: steak time. Yes, your doctor would advise 
against beef so heavily marbled, but every test has shown that fat is the main 
factor in whether beefsteak tastes good. It makes the beef rich and tender, it 
"carries" the meat flavor on the palate and it adds flavor of its own. This is 
probably a Paleolithic thing; as travelers from the Arctic to the tropics have 
reported, a diet of strictly lean meat can't support human life. On some 
primitive level, perhaps our in medulla oblongata or "reptilian brain," we 
yearn for fat. 
</P>
<P>
 So here's the report. Skip the domestic filet and the Japanese New York steak 
on bang-for-the-buck principles. Go for the biggest bang, the Wagyu filet, 
which is extraordinary, unlike any other steak -- it literally melts in your 
mouth, like a cross between beef and butter, and a little goes a long way. The 
second-best steak, oddly, is the cheapest, the Black Angus New York cut. It's 
nowhere near as rich and tender, but it has a powerful beefsteak flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 By this point in the meal, the reptilian brain is sated. There'll be some sort 
of dessert -- ginger ice cream or maybe shortcake or tiramisu. You'll scarcely 
notice.

STAGE WATCH: IT'S A HEAVENLY ASSIGNMENT FOR TONY KUSHNER, BUT NOT THIS SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pulitzer winner Tony Kushner might just be America's busiest playwright. He 
might also be the most overbooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after we digested the news that the "Angels in America" scribe's "The 
Heavenly Theatre" was being postponed from its slot at the end of the current 
Mark Taper Forum season, we also learned that his adaptation of Brecht's "The 
Good Person of Setzuan" will be produced at the La Jolla Playhouse during the 
same summer months that "The Heavenly Theatre" would have been at the Taper. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heavenly Theatre" had been planned for that Taper slot for nearly a year. As 
far back as 1991, the Taper received a $125,000 grant from the W. Alton Jones 
Foundation to stage the play. Shouldn't it take priority? 
</P>
<P>
 The two projects "have nothing to do with each other," replied Kushner. "The 
La Jolla thing is a straightforward adaptation. It's a very easy piece of work. 
I'll have it done within a couple of weeks. My part in it is minimal." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that he hopes to collaborate on the "Setzuan" script with playwright 
Eduardo Machado, and Los Lobos, the celebrated East L.A. rock band, has been 
asked to do the music and lyrics. Playhouse officials confirmed they were 
talking to Los Lobos and Machado, but added that nothing had been settled; a 
spokeswoman for Los Lobos agreed with that report. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Heavenly Theatre," which is set in 16th-Century France, is "much more 
complicated" than "Setzuan," Kushner said. "It's the first thing I ever wrote 
(in 1985), and I have to figure out how to change it without losing its 
naivete." Kushner finds plot and storytelling to be the hardest part of writing 
plays, so originals are more difficult for him than adaptations. 
</P>
<P>
 Kushner, "Heavenly" director Brian Kulick and composer Mel Marvin will meet 
for "a secret workshop" on the project in May or June. But in the meantime, 
he's also wrestling with his screenplay adaptation of his award-winning "Angels 
in America." So he didn't feel he had enough time for "Heavenly," and "I didn't 
want to get rushed into it." 
</P>
<P>
 He emphasized that his decision in no way reflects any dissatisfaction with 
the Taper, which carefully nurtured his "Angels in America": "My loyalty is 
first and foremost to the Taper." 
</P>
<P>
 PICKETS AT THE ALEX: A picket line greeted theatergoers at the first 
performance of the restored Alex Theatre's inaugural production, "Sayonara," on 
Jan. 27. Since then, many customers have been handed leaflets by disgruntled 
union workers as they walked in. 
</P>
<P>
 Theatre Corp. of America, which manages the Alex, doesn't hire members of the 
International Alliance of Theatrical Stage Employes -- including stagehands, 
wardrobe and box-office workers -- at either the Alex or its sister theater, 
the Pasadena Playhouse. With productions at both theaters now being exported to 
circuits of other Southland theaters, union officials are afraid they're being 
frozen out of an expanding empire. 
</P>
<P>
 The union accuses Alex officials of spending $6.5 million of taxpayer money to 
refurbish the theater but discriminating against hiring those particular 
taxpayers who belong to the union, of paying "bottom-of-the-barrel" wages, and 
of endangering actors and the public by barring union stagehands and hiring 
"less experienced" workers. The leaflet passed out to theatergoers said Theatre 
Corp. actions were illegal as well as unethical. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Wood, secretary treasurer of Los Angeles County Federation of Labor, 
AFL-CIO, joined the cause, signing a letter to other union leaders saying that 
if the Alex management is allowed to "escape unscathed, we invite management 
throughout the industry and the region to believe they can trample on us and 
violate our rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Theatre Corp. officials declined all comment. However, a leaflet included in 
the programs boasted that "our industry's finest stagehands and technicians" 
were hired "without regard to their membership in any particular organization. 
It remains the policy of the Alex Theatre to provide equal opportunity to all 
tradespersons." 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate to see the opening blemished by something that's so silly," said 
Laurence Clarke, chairman of the Alex Regional Theatre Board, which hired 
Theatre Corp. to run the theater. But "anyone watching the performance would be 
hard-pressed to say it isn't professional." 
</P>
<P>
 The fracas is between the union and the Theatre Corp., not his own board or 
other civic officials, Clarke said. However, it's his impression that Theatre 
Corp. simply hired workers they've used for a long time, he added. He's "very 
happy" with the Theatre Corp. management. 
</P>
<P>
 MUSIC OF THE NIGHT: Talk about powerful quakes -- the Jan. 17 shaker even 
stopped Andrew Lloyd Webber, at least for a few months. The producer-composer 
had booked a Warner Bros. recording studio in Burbank for two weeks, beginning 
Jan. 16, to record the "Sunset Boulevard" cast album. When the studio was 
damaged and an alternate site couldn't be found, "we lost our timing," said a 
Lloyd Webber spokesman. Lloyd Webber's other commitments will prevent him from 
returning to oversee the recording session until April. But the project is not 
in any danger of being derailed completely, said the spokesman.

RECORD RACK: ALTERNA-THRUSH HERSH FOLLOWS HER MUSES; *** KRISTIN HERSH, "HIP 
AND MAKERS"; REPRISE  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is the 27-year-old singer-songwriter's first solo album since she decided 
to put Throwing Muses, her arty, 8-year-old quartet, on the back burner. 
Hersh's solo debut stands out as some of her best work yet.On the current 
alternative scene, only her stepsister and former Muses sidekick Tanya Donelly 
(now the leader of Belly) can match her crystalline vocalizing. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Muses' jerky, angular rhythms and disturbing tones, Hersh's 
near-folkie acoustic guitar spins delicate webs of organic melody. The subtle 
violin and cello lines serve as a moody backdrop and add depth to spare, simple 
songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Another development is Hersh's less restrained, dramatically angry vocals on 
such songs as "Houdini Blues," which may partly reflect the influence of her 
co-producer, ex-Patti Smith Group guitarist Lenny Kaye. On "Velvet Days," Hersh 
retains her pure and high vocal strains, which coat her emotional and often 
harsh lyrics with a stunning otherworldliness. 
</P>
<P>
 This album packs as much Angst as Nirvana's "Nevermind" -- but in a polished, 
delicate package. It clearly proves that Hersh is more than just a ruling diva 
in the arty underground. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent). LORRAINE ALI

RECORD RACK: * 1/2 NKOTB, "FACE THE MUSIC"; COLUMBIA  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI and CHRIS WILLMAN

<P>
 They can run, but they can't hide: It'll take more than an acronym trick for 
those New Kids on the Block to pull the wool over our eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Face the Music" represents the vocal quintet's bid at holding onto its old 
bubble-gum audience while moving boldly ahead toward earning its hip-hop 
"props."The first few cuts, designed to establish NKOTB's newfound street 
savvy, are particularly embarrassing: Dig the four-letter words and Public 
Enemy influences in the intro! Thrill as Donnie Wahlberg proves he was the 
brains behind Marky Mark in "Dirty Dawg," in which they be dissin' a ho, man!  
</P>
<P>
 Credibility thus established, the erstwhile Kids are freed to move on to much 
more palatable material for most of the album's remainder -- namely, ballad 
singing. They're backed by the best tracks money can buy -- via hit producers 
including Teddy Riley, Narada Michael Walden and Walter Afanaseiff -- and 
succeed creditably at last in their adolescence-long quest to sound black. But 
in winning the battle, NKOTB may lose the war, because sounding black isn't the 
same as sounding soulful, and the expertness of their emulation of 
up-to-the-moment R&B vocal-group sounds only helps point up the futility of the 
whole exercise when they can't make the important leap from basic harmonies to 
transformative melisma.

RECORD RACK: ** 1/2 RICHARD THOMPSON, "MIRROR BLUE"; CAPITOL  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI; CHRIS WILLMAN, ; RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 You can think of Richard Thompson as a sort of quirky Clapton -- a '60s 
survivor with a common-man voice, a supernatural touch on the guitar and scars 
on the soul, an inconsistent but ambitious artist who at his best forges 
spiritual and carnal concerns into music of rare resonance. 
</P>
<P>
 This time around he seems a little restless, stirring up his formula of folk 
rock and exotica by encouraging producer Mitchell Froom to go slightly wild 
with the atmospherics.The result is sometimes akin to Tom Waits' aural theater, 
and while the experimental edge is invigorating, much of the material is 
emotionally pale and musically slight. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson's artistry soars when he sheds the trimmings, as in "King of 
Bohemia," on which nylon-string guitar forms a protective halo around solemn 
words of solace. In "Beeswing," simple Celtic-folk curlicues carry a deftly 
drawn, deeply felt portrait of the free spirit who won and eventually broke his 
youthful heart. The fading of her flower is "the price you pay for the chains 
you refuse," he allows near the end of this intimate and epic gem. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson is rarely so generous of spirit, and his head cold of a singing voice 
compounds a frequently patronizing tone. He's an Elvis Costello-like lyricist 
in his romantic post-mortems, but his bitterness needs a Costello-caliber 
delivery to transcend self-absorption. Too often, Thompson seems trivially 
cranky. 
</P>

POP MUSIC CHARTS: A FLYING START

 Alice in Chains' "Jar of Flies" album igured to be off to a fast start -- but 
not this fast. It debuted on top of both The Times' Southern California and the 
national pop album charts. Quite a feat for this Seattle quartet, which climbs 
into heavyweight commercial category with bands like Pearl Jam and Nirvana. 
Look for Celine Dion's single "The Power of Love" -- up another notch to No. 2 
-- to power its way to the top in the next week or two. A fast-rising album 
with No. 1 potential is Ace of Base's "The Sign," which jumped from No. 16 to 
No. 8. TOP 10 ALBUMS 03,04,41,11 Title, Artist (National Rank) Last Week 1 Jar

 ** Freddie Jackson, "Here It Is," RCA. Could Jackson be the Michael Bolton of 
black music? Back from a lengthy recording hiatus, Jackson really oversings to 
his heart's content on several cuts."Was It Something" and "How Does It Feel" 
fare well under such treatment, but his overemoting on the love-gone-wrong 
ballad "My Family" doesn't make sense. Like Bolton, Jackson lacks much in the 
sincerity department.

 *** Ace of Base, "The Sign," Arista. The spirit of late-'70s Euro-disco lives 
on in Ace of Base, the Swedish quartet known for the singles "All That She 
Wants" and "The Sign."On their debut album, that old formula -- in-your-face 
bass, snappy beats, syrupy melodies, tinny vocals and simplistic 
boy-deals-with-girl lyrics -- makes for some great, mindless dance music.

 *** Blood of Abraham, "Future Profits," Ruthless. Jewish rap has generally 
meant comic relief (Beastie Boys, 2 Live Jews), but these guys ain't joking.A 
nimble mix of old school and new school beats supports a Zionist message 
paralleling hip-hop's standard Afrocentric rhetoric. A sense of common heritage 
is underscored by the guest appearance of Eazy-E on the unity manifesto "Niggaz

POP EYE: CASH & CLINTON? THIS COULD BE A LEGENDARY 'LOLLAPALOOZA' 
</P>

 Will the kids in plaid go for the Man in Black? 
</P>
<P>
 Or will they groove on the captain of the Parliament-Funkadelic Mothership? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, country-rock legend Johnny Cash and funk pioneer George Clinton may be 
along for part or all of "Lollapalooza '94." 
</P>
<P>
 Cash, 61, and Clinton, 53, are older than many of the parents of the 
alternative-rock fans who dominate the "Lollapalooza" audience, but the tour 
organizers believe both veterans will add an unexpected dash of character and 
history to a tour concept that many felt was becoming too predictable. 
</P>
<P>
 Cash was a Memphis sidekick of Elvis Presley, Carl Perkins and Jerry Lee Lewis 
in the '50s and has been voted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame alongside 
them, while Clinton's records have influenced virtually every funk and rap 
artist from Prince to Ice Cube. 
</P>
<P>
 They're expected to join such alternative bands as Nirvana and Smashing 
Pumpkins, who are widely heralded but are no longer the "discoveries" that the 
tour once promised to showcase each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Geiger, director of A&R for American Recordings and a member of the 
four-man "Lollapalooza" brain trust, would not confirm any of the acts, but 
said that the likes of Cash and Clinton would be valuable additions to the 
tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "With so-called alternative acts now selling millions of their debut albums, 
we felt the need to get more legends involved," he says. "To offset and balance 
the flavor-of-the-month aspect, we felt we should put in some perspective and 
history and depth." 
</P>
<P>
 Though plans are still tentative, Cash might do only a dozen or so of the 
"Lollapalooza" shows and then be presented as the star attraction on a new 
"acoustic" side-stage format that may also feature guest appearances by 
main-stage headliners such as Nirvana. Clinton presumably would be part of the 
main-stage lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 The notion of Cash -- who has just recorded an album with producer Rick Rubin 
-- has received a lot of support within the alternative music world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's great," says Darcy Sanders, music director for KROQ-FM. "If Neil 
Young can play with Pearl Jam and if Tony Bennett can play at our 'Acoustic 
Christmas' concert, this should work perfectly. Cash and Clinton are real, not 
second-generation imitations." Steve Hochman

 CABLE READY: Apparently being part of the multi-corporate team backing a new 
music video/home shopping cable TV channel isn't enough for Ticketmaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The company -- which has joined EMI Music, PolyGram, Sony Music and the Warner 
Music Group to create a video music channel to challenge MTV -- is preparing to 
launch its own Ticketmaster Channel, devoted to tickets, concert merchandise, 
records and videos. Look for it to be in operation within 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticketmaster CEO Fred Rosen wouldn't comment on the new channel, but 
acknowledges that he and the company's new owner, Microsoft co-founder Paul 
Allen, "will clearly be investing in and be part of other opportunities that 
are involved in the entertainment highway of the future." Bruce Haring

 AND ONE MORE THING: In case you were wondering about the haunting instrumental 
bit of "Blue Moon" used in Norwegian Cruise Lines' current TV ad -- you might 
have seen it during the Super Bowl telecast last week -- it's not the Cowboy 
Junkies. 
</P>
<P>
 Junkies guitarist Michael Timmins says that the group was asked to provide its 
version of the song, which is on the group's 1987 breakthrough album "The 
Trinity Session," for the spot, but declined. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have anything against people who let their music be used in 
commercials," he says. "But when it's something we put a lot of heart into, we 
want the audience to feel the same way and I'm not sure they do when it's used 
to sell something." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the version in the ad, Timmins says, "It's flattering that they wanted 
it to sound like us." But he jokingly says he can tell the difference: "I know 
it's not us because this version is played in rhythm."*

WINE MARKUPS GETTING MARKED DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, Berger is The Times' wine writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You know the feeling. You've just sat down at a restaurant and are getting 
ready to order the wine. But what's this? That modest little Merlot you paid 
just $10.99 for at the wine store yesterday costs $32 here. So you order 
something else -- or you order nothing at all. 
</P>
<P>
 But slowly, Southern California restaurateurs are re-evaluating their 
wine-pricing policies and winching prices downward in response to what some 
wine industry executives see as a backlash by consumers tired of paying more 
for wine than for entrees. 
</P>
<P>
 Although this downscaling of wine prices isn't commonplace yet, the new 
policies of two restaurants, announced last week, is a strong indication that 
lower wine pricing could generate more profits and more loyal patrons.  
</P>
<P>
 At Clinton Street (in the West Hollywood spot that once housed the Melting 
Pot), prices for the 20-wine list are established by taking the wholesale price 
of each wine and adding $8 a bottle. Or, in the case of our theoretical $10.99 
retail wine, about $19. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar policy will go into effect at Vida, which chef Fred Eric plans to 
open this month in the Los Feliz space that was until recently Duplex. Less 
than $8 will be added to the suggested retail price of each of the 
approximately 100 wines on the list. Using our $10.99 retail wine again, about 
$18. 
</P>
<P>
 The programs were instituted by owner Russell Ruscigno at Clinton Street and 
general manager Dean Gold at Vida; both feel diners should get better wine 
values and view standard pricing schemes as flawed. 
</P>
<P>
 Dining out, often a pleasant or celebratory occasion, ought to be the perfect 
time to order a bottle of wine. And decent wine enhances the flavor of food. 
Yet many restaurant wines are priced out of the reach of average customers. 
Following a standard pricing formula, most restaurants take bottles of wine 
that cost $10 wholesale and mark them up to $30, or more. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, the small percentage of restaurants that cellar great red wines 
until they mature are justified in charging more because cellar time equals 
money. But most wine lists have few older red wines, and it seems that 
currently available wines should be priced with more attention to the 
real-world price of a wine.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, pricing policies are often justified by restaurant managers, who say, 
"Well, we have fancy glassware," or "We carry a large inventory," or "We have a 
Monet in the men's room," and wine sales are expected to pay the bills for 
those things. Especially now, it's tough for restaurants to make a profit and 
restaurateurs see liquor tabs as one of the few ways left in the business to 
make any money.  
</P>
<P>
 But formula pricing is changing, says Reuben Katz, director of food and 
beverage operations at the Culinary Institute of America at Hyde Park, N.Y., 
who admits that a three-times-wholesale (or twice retail) formula once was a 
part of culinary education programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today that formula is getting reduced," Katz says. "(Restaurant) people are 
picking lower multiples because they are finding more resistance. Customers are 
better educated. They question pricing more than they once did." 
</P>
<P>
 At Green Street in Pasadena, wine is now priced at just twice wholesale. The 
new Tommy Tang's, set to open soon in Pasadena, will price its wine in the same 
manner. (Prices are higher at the original Tommy Tang's on Melrose, with a 
markup of about 2.6 times wholesale.)  
</P>
<P>
 Butterfield's on Sunset lowered wine prices more than a year ago and response 
has been so good that wine buyer Joy Shollenbarger says she is trying to keep 
the markup at less than twice wholesale.  
</P>
<P>
 The Silver Grills in Encino and in Beverly Hills offer special wines at cut 
rates, such as the current Ferrari-Carano Chardonnay and Cabernet Sauvignon at 
$22 a bottle; it sells for as much as $35 elsewhere. At the Capri in Desert Hot 
Springs, all wines are priced at about $10 over cost, including the 1989 Guenoc 
Langtry Red, which is selling for $35, the same as you would expect to pay in a 
wine shop. Three other restaurants with inexpensive wine pricing policies are 
San Gennaro in Brentwood Village, and two Newport Beach restaurants, Sapori and 
Sabatino's Shipyard Co. All buy wines at special short-term discounts (called 
post-off pricing in the trade) and they pass along the savings by simply 
doubling their costs. At San Gennaro, for instance, most bottles are priced at 
$10. 
</P>
<P>
 Other old favorites with reasonable wine pricing include Misto in Torrance, 
where co-owner Michael Franks says all wines are priced just over twice 
wholesale, and Les Freres Taix on Sunset Boulevard, where Michael Taix has 
hundreds of wines priced so low you think they're a misprint.  
</P>
<P>
 "You take dollars to the bank, not percentages," says Clinton Street's 
Ruscigno. "It's great to charge three times cost for wine, but you might not 
sell it. I'll charge eight bucks over what I paid and I'll sell it." 
</P>
<P>
 "(The usual three-times markup) doesn't work in cities where warehouse stores 
are prevalent," says Evan Goldstein, a master sommelier and director of the 
Sterling Vineyards School of Service and Hospitality, "though it still exists 
in hotel restaurants." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But even some hotels are catching on. The Tower at the Holiday Inn on Lakewood 
Boulevard in Long Beach has a wine list with most wines priced at less than 
$20. Since the inception of that policy in November, wine sales have doubled, 
says Baldissari Sanzone, director of food and beverage and executive chef. 
</P>
<P>
 He says that the hotel's owners will keep the low-price policy for six months 
and then evaluate it. If successful, he says, the policy may be adopted by 
other hotels owned by the group. 
</P>
<P>
 "When consumers see Kendall-Jackson Chardonnay at $6.88 in the local discount 
house and $25 or $35 at a restaurant," says one wholesale wine executive who 
asked for anonymity, "they feel they're getting ripped off." Customers know 
that while retail discount shops often pass along savings, restaurants rarely 
do. But, he adds, the backlash is silent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody is comfortable dickering over price," he says. "Nobody says to the 
waiter, 'I like the Mondavi Chardonnay, but that $35 price bothers me. I'll 
offer you $28.' They don't do that. They just clam up." Many simply order no 
wine at all. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last few years, wineries have taken smaller margins, wholesalers have 
taken smaller margins, and retailers have taken smaller margins," says the 
executive. "The last part of the system to take a lower margin is the 
restaurant, and now that's happening."*

SAME OLD 'TOON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "Prime Time's New Man About 'Toon," by Daniel Cerone (Jan. 23): 
</P>
<P>
 I wish the creators a lot of luck with "The Critic," because I am in the 
business and a successful prime-time cartoon program would help our entire 
industry. But I'm afraid this is another case of "here we go again." 
</P>
<P>
 First, why is "The Critic" being done in animation at all? The humor, as 
described in the article, is all of the static, verbal, sitcom, "blah-blah-blah 
. . . ha-ha-ha!" variety. I'm sure there will be lots of funny lines of 
dialogue from people who worked on "Murphy Brown" and "Seinfeld." But the fact 
network pundits always ignore is that animation is a visual medium. It requires 
a whole different kind of thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Simpsons" was a true cartoon concept, created by Matt Groening, a 
cartoonist. It had already been produced on film before the networks got their 
hands on it. And the show is blessed with a brilliant supervising writer named 
Sam Simon, a cartoonist himself, who had considerable background in writing 
animation before becoming a live-action sitcom writer. Which leads me to my 
second, but most significant, reservation about "The Critic": the writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Every time somebody decides to do animation in prime time, I see the same 
tired quote: "To keep the writing sharp, (we) carefully selected a stable of 
writers with experience in sophisticated comedy -- not screwball animation." 
The main reason shows like "Fish Police" and "Capital Critters" and all the 
other flops did not work is because of the same false assumption -- that people 
familiar with the medium of animation should be the last people on Earth to 
write animation. 
</P>
<P>
 I suppose this sounds like sour grapes, coming from a guy who has 28 years of 
writing experience in the animation field. But like Rodney Dangerfield, cartoon 
writers get no respect. My dear former partner, Bill Dance, said it well: 
"Being a good cartoon writer is like being the best-dressed man in Bulgaria." 
My suit is still hanging in the closet.

ERG-ONOMICS 101 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In regard to EMI Records Group, North America, in Pop Eye's annual record 
industry roundup ("Reassessing the Labels After a Record Year," Jan. 16), there 
were obvious problems with your understanding of the structure of our company. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, Charles Koppelman was appointed chairman and chief executive officer 
of the newly formed EMI Records Group, North America.This combined EMI's labels 
and operations from all across North America (which include Capitol Records; 
ERG -- Chrysalis, SBK and EMI Records; Blue Note; Liberty, and others). 
</P>
<P>
 In your article, you seemed to imply that Koppelman was simply responsible for 
ERG and, as such, you didn't even mention the label's current president, Daniel 
Glass, who has been in charge for almost a year. You also included Liberty as a 
part of Capitol Records when, in fact, it is a free-standing label. 
</P>
<P>
 The point here is that by overseeing all of these North American operations, 
Koppelman is responsible for the direction of the entire company -- not just a 
single label. Whatever successes these various businesses experience (as well 
as the "misses") he is happy to share credit (and blame) with the individual 
presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Given your lack of knowledge of the structure of our company, it is difficult 
to give credibility to some of your more pointed and acerbic personal remarks.

AGE OF IGNORANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "The Age of Insolence," film commentary by local critics Kalle Matso 
and Scott White of the Beach Reporter (Jan. 16): 
</P>
<P>
 I am horrified to contemplate the number of trees destroyed to bring us the 
article by those two self-amused nitwits Matso and White. At least Beavis and 
Butt-head admit they are stupid cartoon characters with no redeeming social 
value. These guys think they're funny. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso and White try to hide behind being just two regular guys (who "don't 
profess to know more about the movies than anyone else") while pontificating 
about their extensive film knowledge. Their column in the Beach Reporter, the 
free local handout paper, is a forum for them to share their humorous insights 
with their friends. They contribute nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the resounding impact American culture has upon the world 
community, the massive new technologies that will soon change the very nature 
of our interpersonal and international interactions, or simply the number of 
artists who are actually trying to create something and could use the 
publicity, it is truly disappointing that The Times was so lazy that it had to 
reach into the trash and pull out a free beach newspaper to fill the Sunday 
Calendar section.

<P>
 I suppose Kalle Matso might think "The Age of Innocence" has nothing to offer 
his generation and is not a relevant film, but this is precisely the problem 
with his generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacrifice is the essential theme in "The Age of Innocence" -- even though this 
sacrifice was achieved at the cost of personal happiness and was facilitated by 
the conventions of society, it was no less real or true. 
</P>
<P>
 Matso and others of his "Me generation" may not understand the concept of this 
quaint word, but he might do well to try.

ENDANGERED ACTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Calendar's profile of Joe Stern ("Hometown Boy Makes Waves," by Richard 
Stayton, Jan. 9), I was struck by his concern for the plight of actors, 
referring to them as "an endangered species." His concern has motivated him to 
return to L.A. and gather a group of outstanding actors to put on "The Tavern" 
at his Matrix Theatre.But I couldn't help but notice that he doesn't seem to 
care enough to pay them! 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't seem to realize that the rank exploitation of actors in the L.A. 
theater community is one of the major factors contributing to their present 
endangered status. One of the most destructive things that happened to actors 
here was when Actors' Equity Assn., the union that is supposed to protect them 
and to which they pay dues for this protection, sanctioned the 99-seat Equity 
Waiver Plan, which allows theaters to employ actors but not pay them. 
</P>
<P>
 All the actors I know and care about have paid very heavy dues to reach a 
point of professionalism and self-esteem that has earned us the right to be 
paid for what we do. Twenty years ago, when I was first starting out, I hated 
the idea of working for nothing, but I did it because at that stage of my 
career it was appropriate. But now? Is it still appropriate? I don't think so. 
The accepted and agreed-upon notion that actors must subsidize themselves by 
working in television in order to be able to work in the theater for free is a 
distorted and corrupt idea. It may be good for producers, but it can only speed 
actors toward extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 If Stern really loved actors as much as he claims to, he could demonstrate it 
by finding a way to pay them.

ON THE SET; TRAUMA CENTRAL; HBO MOVIE FOCUSES ON THE DRAMA INSIDE AN EMERGENCY 
ROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The postscript to the new HBO movie "State of Emergency" proclaims that one 
out of three Americans will visit a hospital emergency room this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, it might resemble the fictional inner-city East End Medical 
Center depicted in the intense drama, which stars Joe Mantegna ("Searching for 
Bobby Fischer") and Lynn Whitfield ("The Josephine Baker Story"). 
</P>
<P>
 Mantegna's Dr. John Novelli is on the verge of burnout, the result of too many 
patients and too few resources. To make matters worse, the CAT scanner is on 
the fritz during his shift and a car accident victim, middle-class businessman 
Jim Anderson (Paul Dooley), may have a head trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who really knows what's going on in emergency rooms says this could 
happen," says the Tony Award-winning Mantegna ("Glengarry Glen Ross"). The 
personable actor is relaxing on location at the former Linda Vista Hospital in 
East Los Angeles. His dressing room was once a hospital room. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing and scary," Mantegna continues. "I travel a lot. I worried 
enough when I was in Russia to say, 'I hope nothing happens to me. I don't want 
to end up in some public hospital in Moscow.' But on some levels it feels like 
it's almost like that here. That's what this movie is about. Jim Anderson 
should be at Cedars-Sinai. The moral is drive carefully ... because you will 
never know where they will take you." 
</P>
<P>
 "State of Emergency" was written by Susan Black ("A Year in the Life") and Dr. 
Lance Gentile, a graduate of USC's film school who still works as an E.R. 
doctor in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put myself through film school working in the emergency room," says 
Gentile, who also has a cameo as a doctor in the film. "I work part-time at 
Century City Hospital in the emergency room. The good thing about that is I can 
rearrange my schedule to work on my film and my writing stuff. I have a 24-hour 
shift on weekends and work here during the week." 
</P>
<P>
 In Gentile and Black's original script, the emergency room was a backdrop for 
a love story. When producer John P. Marsh took it to HBO Showcase, the cable 
channel's movie division liked what they read but wanted to eliminate the love 
story and concentrate on the medical aspect. "We wrote it as an entertainment 
piece," Gentile says. "I had something I wanted to say about medicine. We 
thought no one would take a script about the politics of medicine today." 
</P>
<P>
 Though the film doesn't specifically explore the issues President Clinton has 
raised in his health care package, "We say, 'Look at this aspect of medicine,' 
" Gentile explains. "The E.R. is where everything filters down: the AIDS 
crisis, the uninsured, the old. They have nowhere else to go. In the face of 
the huge cuts which have been made, hospitals are closing down. Trauma centers 
are closing down. In the face of the mounting patient load, the idea was to 
have a story that told how these characters survive in this pressure-cooker 
atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the hospital itself is one of the movie's main characters, director 
Lesli Linka Glatter ("Twin Peaks") was very involved in finding the right 
facility. "There are 13 out-of-work hospitals in Los Angeles," she notes. "We 
had a lot of choices, which just blew my mind with the amount of people who 
need health care. When we saw this place, the architecture is really 
interesting. It gave us a really good palate. I wanted to go with something 
that is older, which has seen better days -- which is like our health care 
system. It has gone to seed." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Gentile and Glatter have been impressed with Mantegna's dedication and 
enthusiasm. "Joe Mantegna is just a gem on every level," Glatter says. "'I'm 
the president of the Joe Mantegna fan club," Gentile adds enthusiastically. "We 
went on ambulance rides together." 
</P>
<P>
 Mantegna also spent time with E.R. doctors at two Los Angeles-area hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 At one hospital, Mantegna recalls, the E.R. doctor on call dressed him in 
doctor's whites. "He said, 'How should I introduce you (to the patients)'? I 
said, 'I do have a doctorate from DePaul University in humane letters. You can 
call me Dr. Mantegna. It works.' " 
</P>
<P>
 During his stint in E.R., Mantegna assisted on a spinal tap and helped stitch 
up a girl's head. "I was doing things I was afraid to do before I went down 
there. I said to myself, 'It's only a movie. I'm only going to be acting in 
this thing.' I expected to see guys coming in holding their legs in their 
hands. I really didn't want that." 
</P>
<P>
 But once in the E.R., Mantegna's fears evaporated. "I'm not a squeamish sort 
of person, but I don't think I have that thing to be a doctor, where I can cut 
a guy open and just stick my hand in and massage his heart. It's not for me. 
But here I am, and the doctor pulls up the back of (a woman's robe) and says, 
'Dr. Mantegna, we're going to be doing a spinal tap' and he's throwing needles 
in her. I'm right there holding the test tubes and fluid. 
</P>
<P>
 "And when we were stitching the girl's head, he's right there sticking his 
fingers in her head. And she is looking up at me saying, 'You look like that 
actor!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Mantegna smiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'It's just the blow you took to the head.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "State of Emergency" airs Saturday at 8 p.m. on HBO.

Q & A: JAMES GARNER; ON LIFE 'LESSONS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's hard to believe that it's been 37 years since James Garner became an 
international star as the charming Western hero Bret Maverick on the classic 
ABC series "Maverick." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past three decades, Garner has become one of Hollywood's most durable 
and popular actors, able to go from light comedy to drama with the greatest of 
ease. He's starred in such hit movies as "The Great Escape," "Support Your 
Local Sheriff" and "Victor/Victoria." Garner received a best actor Oscar 
nomination for the 1985 romantic comedy "Murphy's Romance." 
</P>
<P>
 He won an Emmy as private investigator Jim Rockford on the popular '70s series 
"The Rockford Files" and starred in the critically acclaimed Hallmark Hall of 
Fame dramas "Promise," "My Name is Bill W." and "Decoration Day." Last month, 
Garner received a Golden Globe for his performance in the HBO movie "Barbarians 
at the Gate." 
</P>
<P>
 His latest TV project is Sunday's Hallmark Hall Hall of Fame presentation of 
"Breathing Lessons," based on Anne Tyler's 1988 Pulitzer Prize-winning 
bestseller. 
</P>
<P>
 In the comedy-drama, Garner plays Ira Moran, a down-to-earth realist who owns 
and operates a frame shop in Baltimore. For 29 years he's been married to 
Maggie (Joanne Woodward), a sweet but flighty woman. During the course of one 
remarkable day, the couple review their lives together and renew their love. 
</P>
<P>
 Times Staff Writer Susan King chatted with the personable actor about 
"Breathing Lessons," his own marriage and his participation in the upcoming 
"Maverick" feature, which stars Mel Gibson as Bret. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you see yourself and your wife, Lois, in "Breathing Lessons"? 
</P>
<P>
 I see my wife and I a lot in it. I was trying not to think about that during 
the picture. But I don't think Joanne or I could help but relate to our 
respective spouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Ira and Maggie have been married 29 years in the movie. How long have you two 
been married? 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-seven years. I had been married about five months when I went to Japan 
to make "Sayonara." 
</P>
<P>
 Has your relationship with your wife changed over the years? 
</P>
<P>
 After a time, a lot of tolerance goes on. It really does. My wife and I, I 
know, are much more tolerant of each other than maybe we were when we were 
younger. At that time, young love overcame everything and now a more mature 
attitude prevails. I just let my wife get away with murder, like in this. 
</P>
<P>
 Ira and Maggie seem to be each other's best friend. 
</P>
<P>
 They are. That's who they have in life. They have each other. I don't think he 
has friends. And with Maggie, everybody's a buddy. She's never met a stranger. 
</P>
<P>
 Did you get the opportunity for rehearsal before filming started? 
</P>
<P>
 We had a week's rehearsal. I think it's imperative. I think if you are going 
to do a good movie, you need a least a week's rehearsal. I've done pictures 
where you go in the first day and they want you to do a love scene and you 
really don't know the people. That's really hard to do -- any kind of emotional 
scene. I can't tell you how many pictures I have done that the first day 
shooting you just throw away because it's not any good. There's no relationship 
with the people. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you think "Breathing Lessons" would have been made as a feature today? 
</P>
<P>
 No. But they didn't want to make "Murphy's Romance." Sally Field had to fight 
for it. There was no sex, no violence. It was a big hit. 
</P>
<P>
 Do you think TV is willing to tackle subjects that features won't? 
</P>
<P>
 There are a lot of things in TV that are so much better than in movies. And 
also now that cable has moved in, you can do a lot of things on cable you can't 
do on (network) TV and a lot of things on cable you would rather do than in 
movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Like "Barbarians at the Gate," which was made by HBO? 
</P>
<P>
 Yep. "Barbarians" was ideal for cable. It was going to be a feature and it was 
cut off the schedule at Columbia. They had an austerity program. That was one 
of the films that they dropped. So producer Ray Stark went to cable. 
</P>
<P>
 It was great fun. It held everybody's interest, and then they put it on 
(commercial) television. They put it on Fox. I understand they ruined it. 
</P>
<P>
 Didn't you refuse to dub your lines so the R-rated dialogue would be suitable 
for network TV? 
</P>
<P>
 I went in and they said, "Could you change this?" I said, "No, I can't do 
that." Your lips are doing one thing and your voice is doing another. I didn't 
sign to do that. I did about three or four lines and I said, "This is not going 
to work and I refuse." I left. I said, "Go get somebody else to do it." They 
did, and they tried to convince everybody it was me. There is a guy in town who 
does (my voice). He's doing Sees' commercials and everybody thinks it's me. 
</P>
<P>
 What was it like doing the "Maverick" movie? 
</P>
<P>
 It's fun. I am playing Zane Cooper. I guess he's the protagonist -- the 
strait-laced marshal. You will be surprised when you see the movie -- a lot of 
twists and turns. 
</P>
<P>
 How is Mel as Maverick? 
</P>
<P>
 He's wonderful. It was good to see him do it because he has such charm. He's 
funny. He's a great Maverick. 
</P>
<P>
 You were under contract with Warner Bros. when you became "Maverick." Were you 
told by the studio to do it? 
</P>
<P>
 I was told to do "Maverick." I was over making "Sayonara" in Japan. They were 
testing people here for the part of Maverick. I didn't know anything about it. 
They got in touch with the production company (in Japan) and said, "When you 
finish with him over there, send him home." So I came back home and I did the 
pilot of "Maverick." Then the company came back here from Japan and I finished 
the movie and then I did the movie "Darby's Rangers." Then they sold the pilot 
and I did the series. They tested a lot of people. They were looking at dailies 
coming back from "Sayonara" and they said, "We will use him. We got him for 250 
bucks a week, let's use him." And that's really what it was. It was finances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hallmark Hall of Fame: Breathing Lessons" airs Sunday at 9 p.m. on CBS.

RETRO; A&E LOVES A GOOD MYSTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's no mystery about where NBC's old "Sunday Mystery Movie" is hiding -- 
in plain sight on A&E. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is simple: Audiences love a good mystery. And the early NBC triad 
supplied three of the best -- Columbo, McCloud and McMillan and Wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "Columbo" was by far the most popular of the three. In fact, star Peter Falk 
still makes three "Columbo" mysteries a year for ABC. Even before "Columbo" 
became a series in September, 1971, Falk starred as the rumpled raincoat-clad 
LAPD lieutenant in two popular NBC movies: "Ransom for a Dead Man" and 
"Prescription Murder." 
</P>
<P>
 Each episode of the series began the same way: An ingenious murderer would 
commit what he or she thought was the "perfect" crime. Enter slovenly, bumbling 
Columbo in his old car and trenchcoat and somehow he'd put all the pieces 
together and solve the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The Emmy Award-winning series boasted terrific guest stars (from Patrick 
McGoohan to Myrna Loy). And the behind-the-camera talent wasn't too shabby 
either. A very young Steven Spielberg was one of the directors; Steven Bochco 
was a writer. 
</P>
<P>
 An interesting side note: Bing Crosby was the original choice to play Columbo. 
But Der Bingle, then 67, turned down the producers, reportedly because the 
series would interfere with his golf game. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Weaver offered an abundance of lanky charm on "McCloud," which 
premiered on Sept. 16, 1970, as a miniseries. The mystery followed the 
adventures of Deputy Marshal Sam McCloud of Taos, N.M., on assignment in New 
York City. He initially came to the Big Apple to capture a man who had escaped 
his custody. 
</P>
<P>
 After he caught the prisoner, McCloud was given a temporary assignment at 
Manhattan's 27th Precinct, much to the chagrin of the by-the-book chief, Peter 
B. Clifford (J.D. Cameron). No matter what Clifford said, McCloud would always 
end up taking matters in his own hands. Terry Carter co-starred as Sgt. Joe 
Broadhurst, McCloud's partner in crime solving. And Diana Muldaur was McCloud's 
love interest, writer Chris Coughlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Romance and comedy were the hallmarks of "McMillan and Wife", a lighthearted 
crime series in the vein of "The Thin Man." The show marked the TV series debut 
of movie star Rock Hudson, who played the handsome San Francisco Police 
Commissioner Stewart (Mac) McMillan. Each episode would somehow involve Mac and 
his charming, younger wife Sally (Susan Saint James) in solving a crime. John 
Schuck played Mac's methodical but dull aide, Sgt. Charles Enright. Nancy 
Walker sparkled as the McMillans' wisecracking maid, Mildred. 
</P>
<P>
 At the conclusion of the 1975-76 season, Walker left for her own ABC series 
and Saint James departed in a contract dispute. In the fall of '76, the series 
was retitled "McMillan." Sally had died in a plane crash and Mac was now a 
widower. Martha Raye became his new maid, Agatha, who also happened to be 
Mildred's sister. And Richard Gilliland was Mac's new second assistant, Sgt. 
Steve DiMaggio. 
</P>
<P>
 All three mysteries left the airwaves in the fall of 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 "Columbo" airs Mondays at 11 a.m. and 12:30 p.m., Tuesdays at 6 and 7:30 a.m., 
Thursdays at 11 a.m. and Fridays at 6 a.m.; "McCloud" airs Mondays at 6 and 
7:30 a.m., Tuesdays at 11 a.m., Wednesdays at 6 a.m. and Fridays at 11 a.m.; 
"McMillan & Wife" airs Wednesdays at 11 a.m. and 12:30 p.m. and Thursdays at 6 
and 7:30 a.m. on A&E.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: WHAT'S IN A NAME? PROPERTY VALUES, PRESTIGE AND PRIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A tremor of bad vibes has been emanating from south of Roscoe Boulevard, which 
separates Reseda and Northridge. Last week, Caltech seismologists stuck a pin 
in Reseda, proclaiming it the newly revised epicenter of the Northridge quake. 
They also announced that the name "Northridge" stays. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda, which has a lot of single-family homes and small businesses, is often 
upstaged by Northridge, which has all that plus a university, a shopping mall, 
an industrial base and a patina of TV stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the community can't even get credit for being the epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 Some might question why -- in an already depressed real estate market -- 
Reseda would want to claim the natural disaster that is expected to be the 
costliest in this country's history. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Ann Kinzle bristles at the idea 
that Reseda would even care about such a distinction. "The whole Valley has 
suffered," she said. "It doesn't make any difference to me." 
</P>
<P>
 What really gets her goat, though, are news accounts describing Reseda as less 
affluent than Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got homes here that cost $385,000!" she said. "This is a bedroom 
community. They've got an industrial base that we don't have over here." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, these distinctions may be lost on Angelenos unacquainted with the Valley. 
After all, the two communities are contiguous; hard to tell where one leaves 
off and the other begins. 
</P>
<P>
 To the trained eye, however, Northridge ain't Reseda and never will be. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda, for one thing, has a much nicer park. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I grew up in Northridge, but some of my best friends lived in Reseda. As I 
child, I naturally knew nothing of real estate, nothing of finance, nothing of 
the perceptions that attach to certain geographical designations. 
</P>
<P>
 I did know a few things, though: I knew that Porter Ranch -- a Northridge 
subdivision at the foothills north of Devonshire -- was definitely out of our 
league, and that my schoolmates who lived there got much bigger allowances than 
I did. Compared to their big new houses, our little home on Canby Avenue -- 
which cost $15,500 in 1960 -- was kind of crummy. I can forgive my parents now 
-- after all, my father was earning only a starting professor's salary at San 
Fernando Valley State College and had four kids to feed. But I recall feeling 
acute embarrassment when Porter Ranch moms dropped me off. 
</P>
<P>
 And I knew that my mother's fondness for visiting model homes in new 
developments sprang from a wish to better our lot. We were always driving to 
some new and empty neighborhood with flags planted in the front yards instead 
of trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's take a drive up near Devonshire Downs," she would say on a summer 
evening when it stayed light very late. This expression is a longstanding 
family joke, something we still bring up in a tone that implies we are putting 
on airs, something that still makes us laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 I was in junior high when I learned a life lesson about geography -- not where 
the Maginot Line was or Monticello -- but the difference between Northridge and 
Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 My mother told me that some people, people who lived south of Roscoe 
Boulevard, insisted on using Northridge as their addresses. "Why?" I asked. 
"Why would they do that?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Because," she replied, "they think it's better to live in Northridge." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe you have to be from the Valley to understand it, but this is why when 
Northridge is news, Reseda can get resentful. 
</P>
<P>
 As a schoolgirl, I was never taught much about my community. I never knew 
Northridge as anything other than a bland suburb, fully sprung from the mind of 
some developer. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe if I had stayed, I would have come to know and appreciate something of 
the place's past, but as it happened, I couldn't wait to get out of there after 
high school, couldn't wait to find some place real , with a street life and 
sense of place. 
</P>
<P>
 The timeless rap on Southern California is that people come here to reinvent 
themselves, and that history -- personal or political -- is not important. One 
of our not-so-enduring myths, as well, is that we are classless. 
</P>
<P>
 As I look at the San Fernando Valley today, though, I see that it's not just 
people reinventing themselves. It's people reinventing their surroundings, too 
-- erasing history with the stroke of a petition signature, all with an eye on 
the bottom line, all with an eye toward the next rung on the social ladder. No 
wonder it's hard to get a sense of place. 
</P>
<P>
 What used to be the college is now the university. 
</P>
<P>
 What used to be Sepulveda is now North Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 What used to be a part of Canoga Park is now West Hills. (No real hills in 
either place, far as I can tell.) 
</P>
<P>
 And now Porter Ranch is putting on airs, seeking its own community 
designation, no longer content to be merely Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The sensibility is simple. In the words of one Valley councilman's aide: "Give 
me a different name and my property values go up." 
</P>
<P>
 Hard hit as we've been by riots, recession and earthquakes, maybe a citywide 
name change is in order. 
</P>
<P>
 How does Toronto strike you?

FEED A COLD AND POST-QUAKE CRAVINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Robin Abcarian really hit the nail on the head with her article on post-quake 
eating habits ("Quake Leaves Shaken Survivors With a Quirk to Chew On," Jan. 
30). 
</P>
<P>
 I was housesitting in Reseda, and after two days of aftershocks, cold cereal 
and total darkness after 5 p.m., I left the house in search of food and pain 
medication for my headache. When I finally found a store that was open, guess 
what I bought? A 10-pack of Kit Kat bars and a large bag of Cheetos. Oh, yes, 
and Excedrin.

A BUSINESSMAN WORTH CHEERING ABOUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was heartening to read your profile of Yvon Chouinard, a man who has been 
able to build a successful business and yet not forget what it's all about ("A 
Man and His Planet," Jan. 28). 
</P>
<P>
 I contrast him with the basically evil and greedy CEOs of large corporations 
-- oil, chemical, mining and timber companies especially -- whose only goals 
are to milk the Earth's resources and the citizens of the world, and who leave 
nothing but poisoned environment. 
</P>
<P>
 These individuals, who earn millions of dollars annually in salaries, bonuses 
and benefits, would much rather spend millions more on public relations and 
buying off politicians than they would on cleaning up the messes they make or 
attempting not to make the messes in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 I say hooray for Chouinard.

DONATING BLOOD IS QUICK AND EASY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read "Arming Yourself With the Facts About Donating Blood" (Jan. 26), and I 
want to encourage the community to give the gift of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Donating is easy, and taking 20 minutes out of your day could mean saving a 
life, potentially the life of someone you know. 
</P>
<P>
 Local businesses throughout the country could help in this time of crisis by 
hosting blood drives. I own Designer Donuts in Los Angeles, and we held such an 
event on Jan. 4. All it takes is a call to the American Red Cross, and they 
practically do the rest.

READING HABIT BEGINS AT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Coming of Age on the Printed Page" (Jan 25): I remember going to the local 
grocery store and sitting at the magazine stand for hours at a time to read Mad 
magazine and Cracked. It was a form of escape from the dreadful reality society 
was (and is) amid street gangs. Soon I began to check out library books on a 
regular basis -- simple stories such as "Freckle Juice," to everything from 
Judy Blume, S.E. Hinton, to Louis L'Amour and countless other stories, 
magazines and newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 As I grew out of that genre, my interests graduated from young adult 
literature to sociology, history, mythology, philosophy, poetry, religions and 
classic literature.  
</P>
<P>
 I strongly agree with Dale Buboltz in the article. It should not matter if 
young people are reading comic books or the Sears Roebuck catalogue. What does 
matter is that they form a habit. A habit parents should support. 
</P>
<P>
 I went from Alfred E. Newman to James Baldwin, Carlos Castaneda, Aldous 
Huxley, Plato, Aristotle, Homer, Socrates, Alex Haley and Daniel J. Boorstin. 
Not bad for a man with a ninth-grade education. (I had to work.)

<P>
 Driving home yesterday evening from Hollywood (where my car had just been 
broken into), I got to thinking about Francesca Lia Block's young adult novel 
"Weetzie Bat," which has more than once been cited by your writers as a book 
with a joyous positive vision of L.A. that we can all look to in these troubled 
times (" 'Weetzie Bat' Proves Someone Understands," Jan. 25).  
</P>
<P>
 The thing you have to remember about "Weetzie Bat" is that it is a period 
piece. Like "Ramona" or "The Big Sleep," it offers a nostalgic glimpse of a 
Southern California that exists now only in legend.  
</P>
<P>
 The "glam and slam" of the magical realist "Shangri-L.A." Block describes is a 
pre-recession, pre-riot world full of carefree blond punkettes cruising down 
Sunset with the top down munching Oki Dogs. That was more than five years ago. 
Wake up, dreamers. The palm trees are burning.

UP ALL NIGHT / BETTY GOODWIN: TAKING THEIR CUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since the arrival of such spots as the Hollywood Athletic Club and Gotham 
Hall, L.A's pool scene has not been the same. Sawdust and beer bellies have 
been supplanted by expensive leather jackets, cappuccino and chocolate chip 
cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 And now comes another late-breaking development: Pool has come to the great 
American mall, in this case in the form of the Westside Billiards Cafe at the 
Beverly Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Purists may blanch. Others may call it progress. Mall-style billiards offer 
these novel sights: pool players wearing suits, ties and beepers; pool tables 
that are navy blue instead of green felt; beer served (unless, it seems, you 
request otherwise) in Pilsener glasses instead of bottles. The Westside 
Billiards Cafe is for folks who like their pool clean-cut, convenient and 
valet-parking easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Roominess is another consideration. "My likes are very simple," says patron 
David Corwin, owner of Ambrosia Productions, a catering and event company. "You 
can get a table and there's room to move. You can't have your cue bumping into 
someone's rear end." 
</P>
<P>
 But, if you want to run into a famous drummer from a heavy metal band, go 
somewhere else.  
</P>
<P>
 Your body is pierced with 14 holes, not all of them on your ears? This joint 
is not for you. 
</P>
<P>
 "Melrose Place" is your life story? See ya around.  
</P>
<P>
 You're an anesthesiologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center (across the street) 
and want an after-dinner activity other than tuning in to Leno? Welcome aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Great pains were taken to make the place hip, starting with decorative neon 
ceiling strips and halogen spotlights. But the atmosphere still falls short of 
cutting edge, somewhere in the land of Velvet Turtles and Vegas lounges. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the combination of the decor and the after-work crowd make it tempting 
to give the place another moniker altogether -- California Pizza Billiards? -- 
but that may be because you can also order little pizzas between games.  
</P>
<P>
 Open since October, Westside Billiards seems to be finding a crowd, thickest 
on Friday and Saturday nights. Rather than spillover from the Hard Rock Cafe 
next door ("We get people from L.A., Hard Rock gets tourists," points out Paul, 
a bartender), the clientele consists mostly of people living or working nearby 
who discover the place, located on street level, as Angelenos typically do: 
when passing by in their cars.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a prime location," says J.R. Ahn, a Downtown corporate analyst still in 
his shirt and tie and sipping Bass Ale (from the bottle) with his buddies from 
USC. At a table nearby, two couples out for some entertainment after dinner at 
Cafe Maurice deem the establishment not cool enough for another visit.  
</P>
<P>
 Then there are Saul Bernstein and Claude Arnall, regulars who say they play 
pool here at least once a week. They're heavy into a game, their iced teas 
perched nearby. Also nearby are their wives, Linda Bernstein and Etty Arnall. 
The foursome always comes together. The guys play pool. The gals drink 
cappuccino and hold onto the cellular phones. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're happy and they're relaxed," Linda Bernstein explains. Why the phones? 
"My daughter lives in New York and has a date tonight, so I wanted to hear 
about it," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at his game of billiards, Saul Bernstein just grins and says: "This is 
the best place where you can take the wives out and still have fun." 
</P>
<P>

WESTSIDE WATCH: A HEART-AND-SOUL APPROACH TO HEALTH

<P>
 You could say the Church of the Nazarene is interested in a change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Just in time for Valentine's Day, the Santa Monica church is offering free 
"Love Transplants" for interested parishioners. 
</P>
<P>
 But rest easy. Pastor Clarence Crites, who is making the offer via the 
church's outdoor marquee, assured us the operation is spiritual, not surgical, 
and involves love, not vital organs.

 SACRAMENTO-BOUND? In her role as the intelligent Zelda Gilroy in the 1959-1963 
CBS situation comedy, "The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis," Sheila James Kuehl 
imagined herself guiding Dobie (Dwayne Hickman) into Congress or the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, the idea of a woman running for office was generally 
unthinkable. 
</P>
<P>
 But this week, Kuehl will become a real-life candidate. On Wednesday, her 53rd 
birthday, she plans to file her declaration of intention to seek the Democratic 
nomination for the 41st Assembly District seat. There will be no incumbent in 
the race for the Westside and San Fernando Valley seat. The incumbent, Terry B. 
Friedman (D-Brentwood), announced last month he would pass up a bid for a fifth 
and final term in the Assembly and would instead run for a Superior Court 
judgeship. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl said her candidacy is not an example of an actress trying to cash in on 
her fame, but a "logical continuation" of her legal work. 
</P>
<P>
 A Harvard law school graduate, she currently serves as counsel to the 
California Women's Law Center, a policy development and technical assistance 
center, working on issues affecting women and children. 
</P>
<P>
 Kuehl does not consider her situation analogous to actors who leap directly 
into politics. She said she believes her sitcom past, "could cut both ways." 
</P>
<P>
 "Everywhere I go people know and like the character (of Zelda), so they're 
predisposed to like me," Kuehl said. "On the downside it's possible this could 
trivialize my candidacy, but I'm not worried."

 SLEEP EASY: Erik Beckjord wants you to take the next earthquake lying down.

 The Malibu resident has devised a roll bar for the bed. He calls it Beckjord's 
Cube.

 "It acts like a four-poster bed to keep the roof from falling in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The do-it-yourself bed frame is made of sturdy metal piping, which acts like 
the protective roll bar on a Jeep. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the spirit of post-quake generosity, he is giving away plans for the 
gadget.

THE GREAT WESTSIDE SHORT-CUT HUNT; TRAFFIC: EVER SINCE THE QUAKE COLLAPSED PART 
OF THE SANTA MONICA FREEWAY, PEOPLE HAVE FOUND NEW WAYS TO GET TO WORK -- AND 
SOMEHOW MANAGED TO AVOID GRIDLOCK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Psst! Wanna buy a short-cut? 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, there aren't any. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are ways to avoid the traffic nightmare surrounding the site where 
the Santa Monica Freeway fell down, and Westside drivers are finding them. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic since the Jan. 17 earthquake has almost doubled on some boulevards, 
quiet side streets teem at rush hour, and highways as far away as the Ventura 
Freeway and the newly-built I-105 are taking on extra drivers who once sped -- 
or crawled -- along Interstate 10's elevated roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite frayed tempers and delays, gridlock has been kept at bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Listen up. How many horns have you heard?" asked Max Paetzold, a city 
transportation engineer stationed near the freeway collapse site at rush hour 
one afternoon last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Cars were lined up for hundreds of yards in every direction, but there was 
little honking at the spot, where huge sandbagged tarps -- workers call them 
"Saran Wrap" -- cover the stub ends of the severed freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, Angelenos have a sense of survival," Paetzold said.  
</P>
<P>
 Engineers list several reasons why the system is muddling through, at least 
for now: 
</P>
<P>
 * Staggered work hours. 
</P>
<P>
 * Increased use of car pools and bus service. 
</P>
<P>
 * Shortened detours across the freeway's missing link between Fairfax Avenue 
and La Cienega Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 * Computerized traffic signals that have been adjusted to allow greater flows 
of east-west traffic on surface streets. 
</P>
<P>
 * Just plain flexibility on the part of drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There never is one single magic pill," said Tom Conner, assistant general 
manager of the Los Angeles City Department of Transportation. "It's a 
combination of factors that solves the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the quake, Conner said, traffic along that shaky stretch of the Santa 
Monica Freeway averaged about 271,000 trips a day. With the freeway cut, the 
equivalent of 20 lanes of extra traffic was dumped onto city streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact was drastic. In the days after the catastrophe, traffic along 
Jefferson Boulevard more than doubled. It increased by as much as 90% on Adams 
Boulevard and 80% on Pico Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 With Fairfax Avenue closed, along with La Cienega Boulevard, Venice Boulevard 
and Washington Boulevard, north-south traffic was also thrown into disarray. La 
Brea Avenue, which was already near capacity, showed a 13% increase in traffic, 
and similar delays were reported as far west as Lincoln Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, things have eased a bit with the reopening of Fairfax, Washington 
and Venice, Conner said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also put in a plug for a new freeway bus line, based at an 800-space 
parking lot at the West Los Angeles Veterans Center and offering service to 
downtown Los Angeles at $1.50 each way. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's too early to say that happy times are on the horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people who made discretionary trips before the earthquake are not 
back making those trips, but we know (the demand) is out there," Conner said. 
"Traffic will build up." 
</P>
<P>
 Though what's left of the freeway is running at about a third of pre-quake 
capacity, some drivers have struck out to find their own way through 
residential side streets. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows exactly how many of these adventurers there are. But David J. 
Rizzo, a part-time podiatrist who advises motorists as a Los Angeles radio 
station's "Dr. Roadmap," cited a study showing that 52% of drivers never change 
their customary route. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this case what they're doing is following the Caltrans detours," Rizzo 
said, "but I guarantee you, if one street gets too crowded, (other) people will 
start to look elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Author of a guidebook that angered residents whose surface streets he 
recommended as freeway alternates, Rizzo suggested a nifty way for making one's 
way inland from the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting with an eastbound jaunt down Olympic Boulevard, he said, a canny 
driver might swing south at Manning Avenue to National Boulevard, then zig down 
Robertson Boulevard to Higuera Street, which leads to Rodeo Road and a straight 
shot to the USC area. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his other favorites are Ohio Avenue, Sawtelle Boulevard and Braddock 
Drive, which parallels Culver Boulevard in a northeast-southwest direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a residential street and people are going to complain, but it's 
wonderful," Rizzo said. 
</P>
<P>
 One driver who has changed her ways since the quake is Carol G. Miller, an 
attorney and Santa Monica resident. She has taken to car-pooling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I come in more relaxed, there's less wear and tear on the car and I've got a 
chance to get caught up with friends, which we didn't have the opportunity to 
do before," said Miller, a research attorney at the state Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The commute) is getting to be a lot faster than it was before the quake," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a price. To pick up her two fellow riders and get downtown before 
the worst of the morning traffic, Miller finds herself leaving home at 7 a.m., 
an hour before her usual departure time, and staying later in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Her car pool takes surface streets to get around the gap between La Cienega 
and Fairfax, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a Caltrans official said that car pools and buses have been clocked going 
three times as fast on the freeway, even with its detours, as on surface 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite delays of no more than six minutes, bus-and-car pool lanes are running 
about half empty, said Chuck O'Connell, deputy district director of operations 
for traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suspect people are shying away from the Santa Monica Freeway because of the 
detours, and quite frankly, if they swarmed back on they'd create some 
hellacious queues," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we expect them to increase as more people find out about it," he said. 
"Drivers are selecting the routes that meet their needs. It's like water. It 
tends to find its own level." Car Wars 
</P>
<P>
 Since the collapse of the Santa Monica Freeway on Jan. 17, traffic has swelled 
on east-west surface streets near the freeway. Average daily traffic counts at 
two locations on Pico Boulevard tell the story: 04,17,13,12,08 PICO AT: BEFORE 
JAN. AFTER JAN. CHANGE Robertson Blvd. 32,918 55,588 +69% Sepulveda Blvd.

QUAKE RELIEF PROJECTS HELP RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two forms of relief were set up last week in Southwest Los Angeles to aid 
individuals and businesses still in need after the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 West Angeles Church of God in Christ in Jefferson Park joined forces with the 
Salvation Army to set up a disaster relief center for displaced individuals and 
families at the church-owned 20th Century Plastics building at 3628 Crenshaw 
Blvd.West Angeles communications director James Thomas said the timing of the 
joint venture could not have been better. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've seen so many first-timers since the quake," Thomas said. "Fortunately, 
the Salvation Army happened to hear we were concerned with helping people in 
Central L.A., and they got together with us. They have the resources, we have 
the space. It was ideal." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas said the center, which is open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily, anticipates 
being open for at least another week. Volunteers distribute food, blankets and 
sleeping bags. 
</P>
<P>
 To aid small businesses, Operation Hope announced last week a program that 
will give businesses office furniture and supplies lost or damaged in the 
quake. Called the OHLA In-Kind Mini-Grant program, the project awards grants 
for up to $5,000 worth of chairs, desks, file cabinets, typewriters, fax 
machines and other equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Processing centers are at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church in West 
Adams, the San Fernando Valley Chamber of Commerce, the Korean Youth Community 
Center in Mid-Wilshire and El Centro Pueblo in Echo Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants must have had earthquake-related damage, be underinsured or 
demonstrate a need. ERIN J. AUBRY

VOLUNTEERS; LENDING A HAND -- AND A HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN KELLEHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eleanor Walz had two hours to dump a lifetime of belongings into boxes and 
move them from her Santa Monica apartment condemned because of earthquake 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The task seemed impossible for the diminutive 81-year-old, who doesn't drive 
and has no relatives nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 So when a platoon of strangers wearing orange safety vests and green hard hats 
-- the distinctive clothing worn by volunteers with the Los Angeles 
Conservation Corps -- filled her apartment along the 1100 block of 6th Street 
to help move her out, Walz was overcome with emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no one," Walz said, as the group packed her household. "What would I 
do? I'd go out of my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Conservation Corps directed moving efforts all over post-quake 
Los Angeles, particularly targeting elderly and disabled victims in Santa 
Monica and Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Conservation Corps worked with the Urban Corps of San Diego, 
the Conservation Corps of Long Beach and the United Way of San Diego to help 
more than 1,200 earthquake victims retrieve belongings from apartments and 
houses damaged in the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Some victims contacted the Los Angeles corps after learning through government 
agencies and flyers passed out at shelters that the group was volunteering its 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Bourne, a Los Angeles Conservation Corps training coordinator who lives 
in Venice, headed the endeavor in Santa Monica, overseen by the city's police 
and fire departments. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a huge need in Santa Monica, but all our crews were in Northridge," 
she said. "I wanted to be a catalyst for people coming together. So we got a 
crew in Santa Monica. We did a lot of hand holding. It was very personal. 
People were calling us 'the angels.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Conservation Corps, a nonprofit private organization founded 
in 1986 by Mickey Kantor, who is now the U.S. trade representative, is composed 
of 130 people ages 18 to 23. Corps members are paid minimum wage from grants 
and city funds. When disasters hit, corps members spring to action, often 
without being asked to help and without receiving pay from the communities they 
aid. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They did more than move boxes from ravaged residences such as Walz's, where 
rotting food reeked from the refrigerator and dust from cracked plaster settled 
like baby powder over the couch and coffee table. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the volunteer movers in many cases helped displaced victims collect 
their thoughts as they sifted through their shaken homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are these your glasses, Eleanor," asked Linwood Paul, a trainer for the 
Conservation Corps who recently helped Walz sort her belongings as other 
volunteers packed boxes. "I'll put them in your purse, OK?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to know if you're taking any medication," he queried gently. "Do you 
keep it in the refrigerator?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you have any important papers?" asked Melinda Sills, a volunteer from San 
Diego. "A will, tax returns? Here, would you like a drink of water?" 
</P>
<P>
 "All of this is important," muttered Walz. "The will is in a safety deposit 
box . . . the key?" 
</P>
<P>
 "What about these shoes," Sills asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course," she said with a sigh, "my shoes." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a tough way to move out, but without assistance from the volunteers, 
including a homeless man, a student from San Diego and youths from Long Beach, 
all would have been lost for many like Walz. 
</P>
<P>
 Sills, a student and waitress, arrived with the Urban Corps of San Diego three 
days after the temblor hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you get involved with people like Eleanor, your heart gets caught up and 
says you can't go," she said. "She's alone and she had no one to help her. I 
just pictured her as one in a thousand. After that, I went home, got money and 
drove back." 
</P>
<P>
 When four volunteers arrived at the apartment of Kveta Uher to help her move 
out of her badly damaged apartment at 4th Street and Montana Avenue, the 
70-year-old woman from Czechoslovakia was nearly hysterical. 
</P>
<P>
 For a couple of hours, the movers packed Uher's Czechoslovakian crystal and 
straw dolls, dozens of American flags, piles of shoes and a signed photograph 
of President and Mrs. Bush. They labeled the boxes, offering Uher coffee, 
bananas and kind words when the experience paled her. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Uher threw away stacks of her diaries. Volunteer Liv Torgerson 
observed what Uher had done and said: "You don't want to throw those away. 
Those are your memories." Torgerson pulled them out of the trash and packed 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Such moments forged new friendships. Uher, who is staying with a former 
employer and has no relatives here, later received telephone calls from 
Torgerson and others who helped her, inquiring about her emotional well-being 
and her progress in finding a new apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really did care, comfort me and give me courage," Uher said. "Every kind 
word made me feel like crying. I love them. I wish there was something that I 
could do for them. If I get an apartment, I will make dinner for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Bonk, 40, a homeless man who beds down regularly under lifeguard station 
No. 6 on Santa Monica Beach, responded to a flyer recruiting volunteers and 
helped out for more than a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's made me feel very, very good because even though these people are 
temporarily homeless, I feel for them," said Bonk, who stayed with the other 
volunteers at the Presbyterian Conference Center in Pacific Palisades while he 
volunteered. "I know what they are going through." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "The most touching part for me was when we were all leaving Kveta 
and I gave her a big hug. And she said, 'I haven't been hugged in so long.' "

COMMUNITY NEWS: CRENSHAW; MUSIC INSTITUTE GETS CHANCE AT AN ENCORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While searching for a location to move his growing commercial and music 
recording business in 1986, Randy Woodard thought he had found the perfect 
place when he discovered an aging complex at 54th Street and 10th Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Though a South Los Angeles native and lifetime musician, Woodard had never 
heard of the Institute of Musical Art, a music school and performance hall 
built in 1922 in a pocket of the Crenshaw district then known as Chesterfield 
Square. Intrigued by photos, cassette tapes and other memorabilia he found 
scattered about the building's many rooms, Woodard began researching the 
institute's history and was quickly convinced that it was a tradition worth 
preserving in more ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found out that this place was a hot spot for a lot of black entertainers 
over the years -- Marvin Gaye, Sarah Vaughan, Patrice Rushen, Della Reese," 
said Woodard, 37, seated in the institute's small front office on a recent 
afternoon. "It had a rich history, one that not only needed to be recognized, 
but continued." 
</P>
<P>
 So Woodard and partners Kenneth Smith and John Osborne set about acquiring the 
building at 3210 West 54th St. Two years and $150,000 worth of renovations 
later, it is poised to reopen this month as a new and improved music facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Declared a historical monument by the city in 1987, the building now houses 
the institute, recording and rehearsal studios, instruction rooms, a film 
production office called One Chance Productions, and Woodard's new nonprofit 
group, the Preservation of Endangered Musical Art. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to make this a place dedicated to preserving all the music 
indigenous to black America -- jazz, blues, rap," explained Woodard. "Too 
often, black people don't look after their own musical traditions. We've been 
defined by music industry marketing people. We need to see how each musical 
tradition evolved out of another one. They're all related." 
</P>
<P>
 From its original incarnation as a music school and performance venue, the 
institute evolved in the 1960s into a recording spot for a wealth of jazz and 
soul artists, including Billy Davis Jr., George Bohanon, the Sylvers, Nancy 
Wilson, and Earth, Wind and Fire. It was also patronized by local politicians 
such as former Mayor Tom Bradley and Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), who 
recorded and produced radio spots for their campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Though recording will continue to be the institute's stronghold, music 
instruction will still be its heart, said Woodard. Education will cover the 
technical side of the business -- sound engineering, mixing, recording and 
marketing -- as well as performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scratching and sampling are OK, even creative, but young people don't 
understand the real music beneath the electronics," Woodard said. "Music 
education is dying in the schools. We have to pick up that slack." 
</P>
<P>
 Renovations have suffered some setbacks: A flood last year and the recent 
earthquake have slowed construction. Though Woodard does not expect the 
institute to be visually perfect for another year, the studio is operational 
and IMA is opening this month with a local talent search for the film company's 
first project, an account of the history of black music. 
</P>
<P>
 That suits Woodard, who is also forming a musical archive at the institute, 
just fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the history is already right here in the community," he said, 
gesturing toward a hallway filled with framed gold discs inscribed with the 
names of recording artists. "We didn't think we had a place for it. Now we do."

 A note in Santa Monica's Red Cross shelter gives earthquake victims a prayer 
and inspiration hot line number. But the "hot line" tells you to leave a 
message -- no prayer, no inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 Much to hope for but little to count on -- that's the way it's been for 
thousands of dislocated Westsiders since the Jan. 17 quake. From fortress 
houses in Bel-Air to tarpaulin encampments in Santa Monica parks, the displaced 
found themselves in straits as varied as their backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescue came in many forms. For the more fortunate, it was a sympathetic 
insurance adjuster or a healthy savings account. For others, it was a housing 
voucher, a friend's couch. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble also came in a variety pack. Some of the lucky who could go home were 
afraid to, even to clean up. Others had to rely on an alien bureaucracy for a 
new place or cash to stay afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the experiences of three Westside families -- the Peraleses, Coopers 
and Nelsons -- as they coped with distinct slices of the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Other people may have prayed for the green-tag designation that means a 
building is safe to live in. Hector Perales dreaded it. 
</P>
<P>
 The last thing the 33-year-old restaurant worker wanted was to return to the 
single room he shared with his wife, Maria Martin, and their two children in 
Santa Monica's ramshackle Pico neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The family slept at the Red Cross shelter across the street out of fear their 
five-unit building wouldn't survive the next temblor. During a stopover, 
Perales traced a crack that circled the structure's entire base, like the 
peel-away strip on a tin of Spam. Smaller cracks scored the walls and ceilings 
indoors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel like we're playing with a pistol to the head," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The family stayed with relatives in Whittier during the week after the quake, 
then moved back to Santa Monica, where the children go to school. But returning 
to the apartment was out of the question. "I don't want to go there and swish, 
swish , swish, " Perales said, moving his arm like a washing-machine agitator. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight-year-old Elizabeth was in the top bunk when the quake hit. A window 
shattered onto Gustavo, 6, who slept below. A television broke against a 
dresser but never hit the floor because the place is so cramped. The family 
stayed outdoors the first day. Elizabeth can no longer stand going inside, even 
for a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as she goes inside, she wants to leave," Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, Perales said he has been threatened in the past by 
friends of two gang members who went to jail last year for beating him up. He 
would like to leave by the time they are released this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The family scrapes by most months on about $600 from Perales' evening job in a 
Malibu restaurant and Martin's occasional work in an El Segundo factory. It 
would be hard finding a new home for anything close to the $306 a month they 
pay now. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the first week at the shelter, the worry began to show. 
Elizabeth had developed a rash. The couple thought it was time to leave the 
shelter. Their building had just received a green tag, all but dashing their 
chances for emergency aid to help them move to a new apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Perales pleaded his case to Santa Monica's housing authority, which is 
dispensing the federal housing subsidies. "I think it's very dangerous," he 
told a housing supervisor. "I don't want to put my family there just because 
this guy put a paper there." To no avail; the house was deemed safe. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday night, a gap remained in the shelter where their four Red Cross 
cots had been pushed together. The family had moved home hours earlier; 
Elizabeth and Gustavo had the chicken pox. In the apartment, the children 
huddled under blankets as their mother tidied up. Perales sat glumly in front 
of a borrowed TV. Home didn't feel like home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here because there's no other choice," Perales said. "Not because I want 
to."

new place or cash to stay afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the experiences of three Westside families -- the Peraleses, Coopers 
and Nelsons -- as they coped with distinct slices of the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The quake was a ride all right, then came the roller coaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth and Stephanie Nelson, homeless and living in Santa Monica's Memorial 
Park since summer, had just landed a room in a boarding house. 
</P>
<P>
 They would manage the building instead of paying rent. They had moved some 
things in when the quake struck. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage was bad enough to warrant an enter-at-your-own-risk yellow-tag 
designation from the city, so the Nelsons lost their room. 
</P>
<P>
 Four days later came a saving piece of news. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, with six children living with relatives in San Bernardino, could 
get disaster aid. Lots of it. 
</P>
<P>
 A family of their size would qualify for a subsidy for a four-bedroom house, 
big enough to get the family together again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appeared the quake was going to be a blessing for us," said Stephanie, an 
unemployed office worker. "It looked like everything was going to be all 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 They called their children. There was talk of a big Easter party. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of their good fortune spread through the Red Cross shelter where the 
Nelsons were staying. 
</P>
<P>
 They wondered if they were the only people around better off because of the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when the brick hit," said Kenneth, a former air traffic controller. 
"That's when a dream come true turned into a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 The brick was word that they probably would not qualify for the housing aid 
after all, since the rooming house would be repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 To compound matters, the manager who hired them had left. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner brought in someone else, unaware of the couple's arrangement to 
manage the building. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the shelter, the Nelsons were homeless again. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie fast became one of the most visible people at the center -- flying 
about with an unlighted cigarette, making small talk, trying to stay upbeat, 
wondering what to do next. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth listened to jazz, read the Bible, tried to decipher 
building-inspection reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony was not lost that the earthquake had, for the time being, put a roof 
over their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth pointed to the line for dinner -- pasta and salad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why couldn't they have done this for the homeless?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 At the shelter last week, they were phoning around in search of a new place 
away from Los Angeles. Stephanie had a list of four-bedroom houses she'd copied 
from a San Bernardino newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 She still held out hope the couple would get the housing voucher. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to put this in God's hands because basically that's all we've got 
to go on," Stephanie said, trying to choke back a cry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other people have more problems than I do," she said through clenched teeth, 
wiping a tear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to survive. I'm going to survive."

WESTSIDE COVER STORY; 3 DIMENSIONS OF PAIN; THE COOPER FAMILY; 'I'M GRATEFUL WE 
HAVE INSURANCE AND MY HUSBAND CAN PROVIDE FOR US TO BE HERE. I FEEL BAD FOR 
EVERYBODY ELSE.'

<P>
 A note in Santa Monica's Red Cross shelter gives earthquake victims a prayer 
and inspiration hot line number. But the "hot line" tells you to leave a 
message -- no prayer, no inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 Much to hope for but little to count on -- that's the way it's been for 
thousands of dislocated Westsiders since the Jan. 17 quake. From fortress 
houses in Bel-Air to tarpaulin encampments in Santa Monica parks, the displaced 
found themselves in straits as varied as their backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescue came in many forms. For the more fortunate, it was a sympathetic 
insurance adjuster or a healthy savings account. For others, it was a housing 
voucher, a friend's couch. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble also came in a variety pack. Some of the lucky who could go home were 
afraid to, even to clean up. Others had to rely on an alien bureaucracy for a 
new place or cash to stay afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the experiences of three Westside families -- the Peraleses, Coopers 
and Nelsons -- as they coped with distinct slices of the disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake exiled Robert and Michelle Cooper to a $240-a-night suite in a 
Marina del Rey hotel. Any other time, it might be a dream getaway -- a month of 
beach views and lazy room-service dinners. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is no vacation for the Bel-Air couple, who have tried to turn their 
two rooms into something approaching home for their two children, Harrison, 4, 
and Jennifer, 1. The counters are stacked like a pantry with crackers, sugar, 
paper plates, chips and fruit. A microwave oven has turned one bathroom into a 
makeshift kitchen for heating up soups and other food the kids can eat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Room service is not exactly baby food," said Michelle, 29. "They have cream 
of carrot soup with ginger in it." 
</P>
<P>
 And they've been too busy picking up the ruins of their crumpled five-bedroom 
house to go to the beach near the hotel. They've covered their home's buckled 
roof where rafters collapsed. The chimney tumbled, hardwood floors popped open 
and walls reveal inch-wide gashes. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle's bottom lip, cut when a television fell against her during the 
maddening dash through the darkened house, has not yet healed. Nor has she 
shaken the horror of feeling Jennifer's stiffened body -- apparently a 
temporary fright reaction -- just after the quake. Robert, a 42-year-old 
physician, gave the toddler mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and the little girl 
recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Inspectors have deemed the house livable, but the couple plan to spend another 
week or so at the hotel, then move into a rented house in the marina for a year 
while they repair their own. Their insurance company has been kind, but there's 
still a $30,000 deductible on an insurance claim the Coopers figure will hit 
the policy ceiling of $300,000. The house, which they remodeled after buying 
eight years ago, is worth almost twice that. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle is still afraid to enter the house alone -- or take the kids along to 
clean up the smashed heirlooms and box the rest of the belongings. "It's not 
safe for them up there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison, who's eager to talk about Thomas the Tank Engine or his new shovel, 
won't discuss the earthquake and gets angry if you press him. "He has some 
blocks and knocks them down, pretends it's an earthquake. He's scared," 
Michelle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the losses is the family's Scottish terrier, Mack, who ran off after a 
building inspector left a gate open. Days of calling to area pounds had yielded 
no leads on the missing pet. 
</P>
<P>
 Still with bruises on her arms and legs from the ordeal, Michelle said she 
feels guilty counting herself a victim while in a setting as plush as the 
Doubletree Hotel. "I'm lucky," she said. "Everyone else is in a shelter. I'm 
grateful we have insurance and my husband can provide for us to be here. I feel 
bad for everybody else."

HOMELESS SHELTER: QUAKE DAMAGE AND WEST HOLLYWOOD CITY COUNCIL'S ACTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How fortunate West Hollywood was in having only three buildings suffer major 
damage during the earthquake. One of the three was West Hollywood's homeless 
shelter on La Brea Avenue. Approximately four years ago the majority of the 
City Council approved leasing this old, run-down warehouse at $12,000 per month 
for 10 years. We are currently paying around $20,000 per month since the lessee 
defaulted on his payments. So we are stuck with $20,000 per month on a building 
we DON'T OWN. 
</P>
<P>
 So far we have poured millions of dollars into this building for operations 
and making it earthquake-safe. It is impossible to acquire exact figures from 
the city since it is another of their dark secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after the quake the building was declared unsafe, and a red sign 
placed on the building says, "This structure has been seriously damaged and 
unsafe. Entry may result in death." The director of the shelter made the 
statement that the money was well-spent since no one was hurt. But . . . how 
could all this damage take place after so much money was spent making it 
earthquake-safe? Just ask the city where did the money go? A complete 
investigation needs to be made NOW. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't you think West Hollywood needs a change when the council majority 
continues causing millions of dollars to go down the drain? Remember this 
incident and all the others when you go to the polls in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman John Heilman is up for reelection. He approved this Mickey Mouse 
lease on the homeless shelter even though residents were against this, saying 
we need a hospice for West Hollywood residents with AIDS instead of a shelter 
that would not guarantee that it would be for West Hollywood residents. Mayor 
Sal Guariello raised a series of concerns over this project, but as usual John 
Heilman's council overruled him. 
</P>
<P>
 It is time for change. . . . We need a responsible council that listens to the 
public.

TEACHERS: THE UNION LABEL, PROFESSIONAL QUALIFICATIONS AND RESPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Unlike Kip Dellinger (1/27/94) I can lay no claim to being a California 
licensed professional for 2 1/2 decades. 
</P>
<P>
 But adding up many more decades than that, I am a graduate of L.A. Unified, 
mother of two fellow graduates, have a daughter, sister and sister-in-law who 
teach in L.A. Unified, Mill Valley and Tustin, respectively. You can well 
imagine how school talk, as professionals and as parents, has been a mainstay 
of family conversation about these three widely disparate, but quintessentially 
Californian, school districts for these many years. We've read many of the 
mentioned books, all the way back to "Why Johnny Can't Read." 
</P>
<P>
 Combine that with my own honorary life membership in PTA, and my delight as a 
Girl Scout leader in taking our troop to high school graduation, and I believe 
I can match school involvement hours with the best. 
</P>
<P>
 To disparage teachers, to label men and women who have chosen that career as 
being a subclass somehow unworthy of respect for their professional training, 
seems to bear a substratum of bias, against who, why, what and where artfully 
concealed. 
</P>
<P>
 I distinctly remember my first heated discussion of local achievement. I was 
in the fifth grade, at Sheridan Street Elementary, where a classmate, newly 
arrived from New York, loudly asserted all New York children were smarter than 
all California children. I had difficulty with those flat assertions and 
engaged in a most unseemly screaming match over her alleged statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 But let's switch professions and see if the union label is the culprit for the 
put-downs. 
</P>
<P>
 No names, for privacy, but unimpeachable and Californian. 
</P>
<P>
 Picture a municipal employees' strike. Hitting the bricks in solidarity with 
the garbage collectors, bus drivers, police officers, clerical staff, were the 
district attorneys, the public defenders and the medical staffs. Does their 
public employment render their professional training nil? 
</P>
<P>
 Retired volunteer M.D.s helped out, as did practitioners from neighboring 
cities; common decency makes minimum levels of health care a given. 
</P>
<P>
 But courts were hard pressed to replace those municipal lawyers. Law, and 
respect for justice, demand speedy trials or defendants walk. Trials go forward 
on schedule by hiring private-practice lawyers at going-rate billable hours; 
for litigators this is top of the line. 
</P>
<P>
 One advantage employers enjoy during a strike is their savings in wages. No 
employees at work, no salaries to pay. Even when strikers win, they have helped 
finance their own wage hike. In the 1989 L.A. Unified strike, that 
much-discussed 8% pay hike, minus the nine days of work stoppage, resulted in 
an actual cost to the district of 3 1/2%, well below the then-prevailing wage 
increase. 
</P>
<P>
 So, here is the city, furious at the cutback in services, challenging the 
workers' demands, but at least saving tax dollars. The only man costing them 
those high-priced legal fees, standing in their way, is head of the public 
defenders' group, which includes their investigators and support staffs. This 
man is Phi Beta Kappa, magna cum laude, and Legal Aid Society from Harvard Law 
School (that's a top-10% ranking) and he's carrying a picket sign, organizing 
car pools to enable office staff to participate without spending too much on 
gas, preparing his wage-scale comparison figures for negotiations as if he were 
a specialist in labor accounting. He yielded up his control of the situation at 
the moment he deemed fair to as many parties as possible. His supervisors never 
forgave him for his union activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Does that make him less a professional than when he was sworn to the Bar? 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the nature of the employers establishes when united activity is 
appropriate, rather than the academic degree. We have witnessed medical 
professionals in job actions at our county hospital and at Kaiser Permanente. 
</P>
<P>
 Do we respect only the non-union among us? 
</P>
<P>
 Surely I'm not the only person who feels lack of community support has become 
a teachers' burden, as much as a pay scale which traditionally has been 
non-competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't a career focused on concern for children deserve attention in an 
aspiring social order? Was it John Gardner who remarked that a society which 
doesn't pay as much attention to its plumbers as to its philosophers would find 
neither its pipes nor its theories would hold water? And if nurturing children 
is not a priority, how will a society continue viable? 
</P>
<P>
 Wonder what Dellinger would find an appropriate pay scale for philosophers 
these days.

SHELTER: VOLUNTEER OFFERS ANOTHER VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is late morning, I have just completed my volunteer shift at the Red Cross 
Shelter in Santa Monica. (My shift begins at 5:30 a.m.) I begin to read the 
newspaper. I am very upset by David Groves' earthquake article in regards to 
his comments about the Red Cross Shelter and I feel the need to respond 
immediately. I don't want the Westside readers to have an inaccurate portrayal 
of a shelter that has been a godsend for hundreds. 
</P>
<P>
 First, I am sorry that David is one of the tens of thousands of people who are 
now without a home because of the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 I question how much time David has spent at the shelter. It only takes three 
seconds to notice the cots are not "a sea of blue," but rather they are green. 
That's not easy to miss -- there are close to 300 of these forest-green cots. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids are not "running around unsupervised." They are moving about as kids 
will do, under the direction of their parents in a small area around their 
cots, which has now become their home. If they are not near their cots, they 
are on their way to the bathrooms, the supervised play area or the Ping Pong 
table. No child is allowed to remain unsupervised, and parents and volunteers 
are extremely diligent about that. Children do move about and perhaps that 
appeared chaotic to David. But let there be no mistake, these children are 
human beings. How David thought up the world "cattle" offends me. 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter offers three meals a day, at least two of which are hot. There is 
a certified nurse, a counselor and several volunteers on duty 24 hours a day. 
Doctors and school officials come in several times a week. Buses to FEMA, local 
schools and constant information about medical and pharmaceutical assistance 
are a few of the essential services routinely offered. Modest entertainment 
including a five-piece jazz band are among those scheduled to perform almost 
every night. 
</P>
<P>
 On night shift, even after the lights are turned off, the activity continues. 
Volunteers are always available, registering new residents, giving out 
toothpaste or just taking the time to listen as we serve endless cups of hot 
coffee or juice. 
</P>
<P>
 In regards to David's questioning a 7-year-old about what she missed most, and 
she said her Barbie with the pink hat; I was surprised at David's incorrect 
conclusion about the shelter being short on toys. Not true. The shelter is very 
well-stocked on toys and books because of the generous donations by many 
companies and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Little girls bond with their dolls, as each and every one of us bond with our 
own possessions. Losing them all in a half a minute is not an easy notion for 
adults or children to grasp, and prized possessions are dearly missed by all. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the shelter a community emerges. David's cursory look missed that 
completely. Residents help residents. Volunteers and staff help. Many residents 
become "resident volunteers," chivalrously not allowing me to empty large trash 
cans, or helping to unload trucks full of supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Living with 250 other people in a college gymnasium is not ideal for anyone. 
But more than 10,000 people in L.A. are very grateful to have the option to 
live in a shelter during this time of disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 I was stunned to learn during the course of the last two weeks that some 
residents have actually chosen to live in the shelter than return to their 
apartments that are certified as structurally sound. These residents are of all 
races and ages. They are frightened -- terrified to live inside their now 
heavily cracked walls. The comfort of a large group is preferred until the 
"aftershocks stop" or until they can relocate to another apartment. When I 
spend my four-hour shifts at the shelter, and feel the camaraderie and comfort 
provided by this quickly emerged community, I understand these people's 
choices. Of course, for most of the residents the shelter is not a choice, it 
is a last resort, their only option. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake has taught many of us that our homes, our freeways and 
ourselves are perhaps more fragile than we once thought. Together we cope. 
Together we rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 And my respect for the Red Cross grows daily.

FOR SENIORS; A DRAMATIC TURNING POINT FOR EX-CONVICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rick Cluchey knew how to do two things when he was discharged from the Army in 
1953 -- jump out of airplanes and kill. He was 20 years old, married with 
children -- and broke. His heroes were the macho men of war who took to hunting 
animals rather than people, sported tattoos and enjoyed watching boxing 
matches. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his buddies proposed an easy way out of his financial troubles. Cluchey 
served 12 years at San Quentin for taking that easy route. But eventually he 
changed heroes -- from those who caused pain to Samuel Beckett, who wrote about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 That changed Cluchey's life. 
</P>
<P>
 Cluchey was convicted of kidnaping and robbery in the first degree, sentenced 
to life without possibility of parole and locked up at San Quentin, on March 8, 
1955. He had attempted to rob a man in a car. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the prosecutor had his way you'd be reading my obituary because he asked 
for the death penalty," Cluchey said. "But a person can make a mistake. For 
some, a mistake doesn't mean life is over." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after entering prison, his wife divorced him and he later received news 
that one of his children had died. Cluchey looked for a way out. For a time, he 
boxed. 
</P>
<P>
 "In those days, people from the outside came looking for boxers in the 
prisons. But the Catholic chaplain I was seeing told me, 'Look, you're not 
getting out of prison by boxing. You're in prison because of violence,' so I 
started using my mind," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cluchey went to school in prison. He took UCLA extension courses in literature 
and drama and began associating with the men who wrote the prison newspaper. 
There are two dates he remembers: The date he was locked up and Nov. 19, 1957 
-- the day the San Francisco Actor's Workshop, under the direction of Alan 
Mandell, performed at San Quentin. No live play had been presented at San 
Quentin since Sarah Bernhardt appeared there in 1913. 
</P>
<P>
 The prison authorities ruled that no play could be performed with women in it. 
The workshop chose Samuel Beckett's "Waiting for Godot." Cluchey watched with 
the other 1,400 prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Quentin News, the prisoner-run newspaper, described the scene in the 
aisle: "The trio of musclemen, biceps overflowing, parked all 642 pounds on the 
aisle and waited for the girls and funny stuff. When this didn't appear they 
audibly fumed and audibly decided to wait until the house lights dimmed before 
escaping. They made one error. They listened and looked too long -- and stayed 
to the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Cluchey was profoundly moved by the performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw that guy with the rope around his neck, it was me," he said. "The 
poetry I heard moved me, made me feel connected. Prisoners understand more than 
ordinary people the idea of waiting. Beckett wrote the human condition in 
poetic form. I thought to myself, 'He knows life. He knows what we've been 
through and he uses the most eloquent language to describe it.' "  
</P>
<P>
 Cluchey had found his Godot. He wrote "The Cage," a play about life in prison. 
He and Mandell founded the San Quentin Drama Workshop. Cluchey acted in and 
directed "The Cage" and more Beckett plays were performed inside prison walls. 
</P>
<P>
 He had also found his way out. The parole board granted him a release with 10 
years' probation. He left San Quentin in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 Cluchey decided to keep the drama group together. As each member of the San 
Quentin Drama Workshop was released, he would pick him up at the prison gate 
and add him to the company. They toured 200 colleges performing Beckett. 
</P>
<P>
 He married a journalist who covered the San Quentin productions and life had 
the appearance of success. Then Cluchey left one day. He told his wife he'd be 
back after a six-week tour of Europe, and didn't return. He met Beckett and 
spent the next 15 years following him and learning. "He gave so much to me in 
terms of his friendship, his uncompromising love and commitment," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And now Cluchey is back. He's written an autobiography, "Back from the Dead," 
which ends in 1989, the year Beckett died. He's living in Hollywood and he says 
he's ready for his final act. "My final milestone is to stage Godot in Los 
Angeles. I know what he (Beckett) wanted and I want to make a definitive 
production. Give it a life no one has seen before. And that would end Act III 
of my life. I want to go down with something."  
</P>
<P>
 His dream cast? Alan Mandell as Lucky, John Laroquette as Didi, Charles Dutton 
as Pozzo, and Danny DeVito as Gogo. Why DeVito? Said Cluchey: "Beckett would 
get a laugh out of that."

HOT PROPERTY: HE'S THE 'TALK' OF BRENTWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Comedian GARRY SHANDLING, who stars as HBO's fictional, late-night talk-show 
host Larry Sanders, has moved into his newly built Brentwood home. 
</P>
<P>
 Shandling, who plays Warren Beatty's best friend and lawyer in the upcoming 
feature-film remake of the 1939 romance "Love Affair" (also remade in 1957 as 
"An Affair to Remember"), has been approached several times to regularly host 
real talk shows, most recently in the Fox spot vacated by Chevy Chase. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Shandling, who will host the 36th annual Grammy Awards from Radio 
City Music Hall March 1 on CBS, has a two-year contract covering 35 new 
episodes through this year of "The Larry Sanders Show," which he co-created, 
co-writes and executive produces. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Emmy-winning talk-show spoof went back into production in January, 
Shandling had moved into his new house: an Early California-style, walled-in 
villa with four bedrooms in 8,000 square feet on about two acres, including an 
acre of park-like grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a swimming pool made of rocks and boulders; a basketball court and a 
meditation garden on the site, overlooking the city. One of Shandling's hobbies 
is playing basketball, and he studied Zen meditation after being seriously 
injured in a 1977 car accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Shandling, 44, is sharing his new home with his fiance, Linda Doucett, 35, who 
plays Darlene, announcer Hank's loyal assistant on "The Larry Sanders Show." A 
former model, the 5-foot-7, 118-pound Doucett was featured in last September's 
Playboy magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Chicago, Shandling moved to Los Angeles in 1973 from Tucson, where 
he was raised. He was living in Sherman Oaks before moving to Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brentwood house was designed by architect Robert Earl. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Hollywood celebs and other personalities have leased homes in the L.A. 
area. Among them: NORMAN LEAR, whose Mandeville Canyon home was badly damaged 
in the Northridge earthquake, has leased a former home of Carol Burnett's in 
Beverly Hills, sources say. The asking price was in the $40,000- to 
$50,000-a-month range. 
</P>
<P>
 ALAN LADD JR., who bought the late Fanny Brice's former home in Holmby Hills 
in 1992 for $8 million and then extensively remodeled it, has leased his 
Beverly Hills home to a Beverly Hills businessman who was a quake victim, 
sources say. Delphine Mann represented Ladd, and Judy Hanaur, the businessman; 
both agents are with Douglas Properties. 
</P>
<P>
 JON PETERS, who suffered a fire at his Beverly Park home before the 
earthquake, just leased a 9,000-square-foot Holmby Hills mansion that was for 
sale at $9.8 million and for lease at $35,000 a month. Stan Richman, assistant 
manager of Jon Douglas Co.'s Beverly Hills office, represented the owners, and 
Joe Coons, Prudential Rodeo Realty, represented Peters. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the Sunset Strip-area, Saudi Prince MOHAMMED BIN SAUD AL FAISAL has 
leased a three-bedroom, 3,500-square-foot home for a year at $5,000 a month, 
sources say. The house was once owned by comedian Yakov Smirnoff and, earlier, 
by late comic Lenny Bruce. The prince plans to use the home for only a few 
weeks a year, when he's in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Shultz of Fred Sands, Hollywood Hills, had the listing, and Kurt 
Rappaport of Nourmand & Associates, Beverly Hills, represented the prince.

TAKING IT ON THE CHIMNEY; WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW WHEN DECIDING TO REPAIR OR 
REPLACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE O'NEILL, O'Neill is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Terry and Valerie Lupton knew without question the cracked chimney in their 
rented Atwater Village home would need substantial repair work after the Jan. 
17 earthquake ripped through Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 But what they didn't expect was the subsequent thousands of dollars in 
additional damage and danger caused when an incompetent handyman knocked their 
chimney stack onto their front porch overhang, which collapsed in a splintered 
heap of wood, tar paper and bricks seconds before Terry Lupton returned home 
from a walk with his two young sons. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's chipping away at the chimney from the roof line . . . and it goes down 
at a side angle and crashes through my porch," an incredulous Lupton said. "I'm 
thinking this guy's a joker and he doesn't know how to do things." 
</P>
<P>
 Lupton said the self-professed handyman got on his roof after telling Lupton 
the landlord gave him approval to repair the chimney. In fact, the surprised 
landlord agreed to no such deal, and the wayward handyman has since 
disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're so vulnerable and you'd think a spirit of honesty would run through 
all of this," said Lupton of the post-quake days. "That is the really sad 
part." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the Southland, one of the great earthquake equalizers are broken 
and damaged chimneys. In Los Angeles alone, building and safety officials 
estimated that 15,000 homes, from modest dwellings to lavish mansions, suffered 
substantial chimney and fireplace damage in the 6.6 temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the damage has occurred from the roof line up," said Ron Aarons, an 
architect and owner of Calabasas-based Aarons & Associates, who has spent most 
of his post-earthquake days inspecting chimneys. "A chimney is like a flagpole 
and is whipped back and forth at a different rate than the house. The damage 
has been phenomenal." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some reinforced brick fireplaces that withstood the quake with no 
breakage themselves caused damage to the less sturdy wood walls to which they 
were attached, Aarons said. 
</P>
<P>
 And as aftershocks continue to rumble through the earth, many people feel 
desperate to hire whoever is available to repair damage or remove these 
potentially unstable stacks of bricks sitting above their roofs. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts in the field, however, are warning residents to move cautiously when 
replacing or repairing their fireplaces. A poorly repaired or improperly 
installed fireplace could wind up costing lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably the most dangerous thing you'll put in a house," said Al Wiras, 
a 25-year veteran of the fireplace business and owner of California Fireplaces 
in Chatsworth. "You got to know what you're doing. If it's not put together 
right, fire could come up through the seams and start a (house) fire. People 
think they're saving money, but what's a good price when a guy goes to sleep at 
night and might not get up in the morning?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Abrams, a general contractor who runs the Home Doctor company in Los 
Angeles and Ventura counties and who specializes in general home repair and 
seismic safety, agreed. "The list of things that can go wrong will curl your 
hair," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's some advice for homeowners or renters: Inspection 
</P>
<P>
 Safety should be the first concern of any homeowner or occupant who lives in a 
house with a fireplace. And those familiar with fireplaces and their potential 
hazards urge residents to hold off using them until they're thoroughly 
inspected for damage inside and out, preferably by a licensed contractor or a 
mason familiar with chimneys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm advising everybody, if there's any damage at all, not to use them," said 
Kagel Canyon mason Coddy Nuckols. "If there's any cracking, combustible 
materials can get through those cracks." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, fires were initiated from cooking fires 
in damaged fireplaces," said Capt. Larry Jarvis of the L.A. City Fire 
Department Disaster Preparedness Center in Sherman Oaks. "And not only do you 
have the problem of fire spread, but if you use your fireplace and there's 
damage at any point on the chimney structure itself, it could leak toxic fumes 
in your house." 
</P>
<P>
 Those fumes can even enter the home through cracks inside the flue that aren't 
visible and require an expert to spot them. Wiras gets the close-up view with a 
small video camera that he lowers into the flue on a line. "I let it down, turn 
it around in the flue, and sometimes you'll be surprised what you see in 
there," he said. Check Credentials 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone wants to be a fireplace man right now," Wiras said. " . . . There 
are thousands of them out there who don't know what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Before hiring anyone to inspect or repair your fireplace, make sure they're 
licensed and insured. And it's usually best to seek a referral. If friends or 
family are unable to give you names, Abrams suggests calling a fireplace dealer 
for the names of at least three workers they deal with regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, when you call, tell them who referred you. "You have more clout with 
whomever you're calling if you get their name from someone they deal with," he 
said. Permits 
</P>
<P>
 Don't authorize any fireplace work without the proper building and safety 
permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the city of Los Angeles, permits are issued over the counter at the 
Department of Building and Safety along with new standardized reconstruction 
plans that were modified after the quake to allow only metal flues in 
reconstruction of chimneys broken below the roof line. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have imposed severe restrictions on new masonry fireplaces. The 
newly adopted ordinance bans construction of masonry fireplaces attached to 
wood structures -- as they are in most homes. New masonry fireplaces will be 
allowed only if they have metal flues, are free-standing units or are attached 
to a sturdy material, such as reinforced brick, concrete or steel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not impossible, it can be done," said Nick Delli Quadri, senior 
structural engineer with the Los Angeles City Department of Building and 
Safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The new code change that applies to rebuilding of chimneys has stalled a 
number of reconstruction efforts, but city officials defend the change as 
essential. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fireplaces are the first thing to come down in earthquakes," said Delli 
Quadri. "A masonry chimney is a very heavy part of the building. The pieces can 
fall off into the house and kill or injure the occupants, and it can pull down 
the structure." 
</P>
<P>
 Studio City resident Donna Walker was among the homeowners caught unaware by 
the new code. The day after the quake, she was celebrating her good fortune at 
quickly finding an available contractor to repair her fallen chimney. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I'm sitting here with two levels of brick on my roof and they won't go 
any further," she said recently. "But given the choice, I want something that's 
going to be flexible in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker's broken chimney knocked a large chunk of ceiling plaster onto her 
living room floor and the loose bricks hammered deep dents into her concrete 
driveway. "That's scary stuff," she said. "I want something safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more frightening chimney disasters was the damage wreaked at the 
Toluca Lake home of actor Jerry Van Dyke and his wife, Shirley. 
</P>
<P>
 All four of Van Dyke's masonry fireplaces broke in the quake -- including a 
massive 7-foot-wide bedroom chimney that collapsed intact through his roof, 
breaking the ceiling joist as it crashed onto the bedroom floor. On its way 
down, it ripped a hole in the ceiling more than 10-feet wide and barely missed 
the couple in bed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They happened to be sleeping in a four poster bed, which kept the ceiling 
joist from falling on top of them," said Aarons, who was hired by the couple to 
inspect the damage. Alternatives 
</P>
<P>
 A widely used alternative to traditional masonry fireplaces -- and now the 
only acceptable method for rebuilding a damaged masonry chimney within L.A. 
city limits -- is a combination fireplace with a masonry firebox (where the 
wood is burned) connected to a stainless steel flue. A wood-frame chase is then 
built around the flue and encased in a lightweight veneer that matches the rest 
of the fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "They move a little, they give a little and there's not much weight on top," 
Wiras said of the stainless steel chimneys. "I'm not saying they're going to 
hold in a big earthquake, but they're not going to fall in a driveway or 
through a roof and kill someone." 
</P>
<P>
 Only those brands of stainless steel flues designed specifically for use with 
masonry fireplaces are safe for use. Among the most widely accepted are 
Metalbestos flues (which do not contain asbestos, despite the name). 
</P>
<P>
 Wiras warned homeowners away from contractors who, unfamiliar with chimney 
work, are installing flues designed for metal -- not masonry -- fireplaces. As 
a result, they don't fit correctly and can prove unsafe. 
</P>
<P>
 Combination masonry and metal fireplaces, though not the purists' preference, 
have been the choice in many of the region's fanciest homes long before the 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to talk all my clients into using them," Aarons said of the metal 
flues. "They're good and just as efficient (as masonry chimneys.) What I say is 
put the money where you can touch it and feel it -- put it in the mantel." 
Prefabs 
</P>
<P>
 For those who want to completely eliminate all brick, there's the 
prefabricated metal fireplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Prefabricated fireplaces are the least expensive alternative to traditional 
fireplaces. Because they require no foundation and minimal labor, they can be 
purchased, installed and finished for about $3,500 to $4,000 -- compared to 
$6,000 to $8,000 for the average masonry fireplace. The cost of the typical 
combination masonry and metal fireplace falls somewhere in between. 
</P>
<P>
 With so many fireplaces and buildings damaged in the earthquake, many 
homeowners and renters may find a rather long wait before finding a qualified 
mason or contractor available to do the work. 
</P>
<P>
 In such instances Abrams advises residents, whenever possible, to climb onto 
their roof and give the chimney an initial, close inspection for any cracks, 
loose bricks or other signs of movement. If such damage is evident, he suggests 
family members show extra caution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until it's repaired or taken down, make a conscious effort to simply avoid 
that part of the house," he said. "Use common sense. If you have any doubts, 
stay away from it."

RENT WATCH: LANDLORD MUST EVICT DRUG-SELLING TENANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I've been informed by the police that one of my units is being used 
for the sale of illegal drugs. Do I have a duty to evict the tenants who live 
in that unit? What if I don't evict them and someone gets hurt? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Under the State Health and Safety Code, a landlord is required to 
ensure the safety of residents from a nuisance caused by another tenant's 
illegal drug activity. If the landlord fails to take steps to prevent the 
nuisance, the landlord will be liable for damages to others as a result of the 
illegal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the court may order the closing of the premises, and the landlord 
will then be responsible for the relocation costs of all residents who were not 
involved in the illegal activity. Considering the foregoing, it would be 
prudent for you to terminate the tenancy of all residents who are involved in 
the use, sale or manufacture of controlled substances. You may want to work 
closely with the police department to ensure that you are not violating 
anyone's civil rights in your efforts to maintain a drug-free apartment 
building. Ex-Tenant Must Pay for Repairs, Made or Not 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My kids stained the carpet and also left a few cuts in the linoleum. When 
we moved out, the landlord charged us for the stains and the cuts, but I know 
that he did not clean the stains or fix the linoleum. Since the new tenant 
moved in the apartment with those problems, can the landlord still charge me 
for the damages? 
</P>
<P>
 A: If you caused damages to a rental unit, you are responsible for them, 
whether the property owner takes care of them or not. As in a car accident, the 
owner of a damaged car can collect damages for the costs of repairs and decide 
not to fix the car. The property owner can estimate the cost of the repairs, or 
replacement if it is prorated, and charge you for them. 
</P>
<P>
 If you feel that the charges are reasonable, you should pay; if not, you may 
try to negotiate a reasonable payment with the landlord. If you decide to take 
the landlord to Small Claims Court, the judge will decide if the charges are 
reasonable based on the evidence produced by you and your former landlord, 
including repair receipts. Manager Refuses to Rent to a Woman 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I have spent weeks looking for a small studio apartment closer to my job. 
Imagine my frustration when I found the perfect apartment, only to be told by 
the owner that he would not rent to a woman because women use too much 
electricity drying their hair. Can this be legal? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, this is not legal. The Federal Fair Housing Act protects people from 
discrimination based on their sex. Both male and female tenants use electricity 
for a variety of purposes, including drying their hair. Any attempt to exclude 
members of either sex on the basis of unfair stereotypes about their behavior, 
electrical or otherwise, will have a discriminatory effect. 
</P>
<P>
 There are never any valid reasons for "sex discrimination," but due to a lack 
of education on the Fair Housing Laws, discrimination in all forms still 
exists. You will need to contact your local fair housing agency by calling the 
Housing Discrimination Hotline at (213) HOUSING. Owner Obligated to Maintain 
Area Safety 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I live in a second-story apartment with a dimly lit exterior stairwell. I 
have asked the owner several times if he would put in more adequate lighting, 
but he has taken no action. I have just slipped on a banana peel that I failed 
to see due to the poor lighting, and as a result, have a very sore ankle. What 
can I do to enlighten this owner? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The owner has an obligation to maintain the premises in a safe and 
habitable condition, and may be liable for any harm caused to you due to the 
lack of sufficient lighting. You may wish to write to the owner about the 
relationship between your recent accident and the continuing problem with poor 
lighting in your building. If this does not work, contact your city building 
official who will inspect the premises and notify the owner if the lighting is 
below code requirements or is otherwise unsafe. Your local housing counseling 
program can also assist you by contacting the owner and explaining both the 
tenants' need for better lighting and how his own best interest lies in making 
certain that his building meets all safety requirements. Rent Can Be Raised 
When Lease Expires 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Our lease ends this month; however, the owner and I have agreed to continue 
our arrangement on a month-to-month basis until my husband's out-of-state 
transfer to Washington comes through. Can the owner raise the rent under these 
circumstances? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, now that your lease has expired, the owner may raise your rent, but 
must give you a 30-day notice in keeping with your new status as a 
month-to-month tenant. The 30-day notice allows both you and your landlord more 
flexibility, and as such, makes it easier for the landlord to raise your rent. 
If the increase will create a hardship for your family, you may wish to contact 
a tenant/landlord agency in your area for additional information and 
assistance. Of course, tenants and landlords in rent-control areas should 
consult the appropriate agencies to find out how local ordinances affect the 
timing and amount of any rent increases.

AT HOME: FRIENDLY MIX ABOUNDS IN 'ZONING SALAD'; SANTA BARBARA: ETHNICALLY 
DIVERSE NEIGHBORS LIVE IN HARMONY WITH EACH OTHER AND INDUSTRY IN CITY'S LOWER 
EASTSIDE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY A. PRICE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Price is a Santa Barbara free-lance 
writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Willie Rowan moved to Santa Barbara's Lower Eastside from New Orleans in 1957 
to be near relatives. And while her kin still live nearby, the area itself has 
taken on the qualities of a family. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's open," Rowan said. "It's warm. It's friendly. I can be out in the yard 
watering and people will just stop and talk, and you don't know who they are." 
</P>
<P>
 After renting an apartment for several decades, Rowan recently became a 
homeowner. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a bargain," she said of her two-bedroom California cottage on a 
good-sized lot that she bought for about $250,000. But there is one drawback: 
"I'm in the midst of industry." The problem for Rowan and about 200 other 
homeowners in her little pocket of the Eastside is the manufacturing zoning, 
which prohibits them from making significant improvements to their residential 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
 But she is philosophical about it: "If you want to own, you have to start 
somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 And although she is now looking to buy a larger home, she is not considering 
leaving the Lower Eastside, which is roughly bordered by U.S. 101 to the south, 
Anapamu Street to the north, Salinas Street to the east and Garden Street to 
the west. 
</P>
<P>
 Other parts of Santa Barbara are "so sterile," Rowan said. On the Eastside, 
working-class Latinos, African Americans and whites live side by side. "We have 
a little flavor," she said. "I would hate to see where everything looked the 
same." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Retaining the special character of the Lower Eastside and yet dealing with its 
problems is a goal of the Eastside Study Group, which met recently to come up 
with recommendations for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of a zoning salad," said City Councilman Gil Garcia, an architect 
active with the study group. He is proud of the mix of commercial, residential 
and industrial properties, and the Eastside's "unique sense of community." 
"That's what we want to preserve," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lower Eastside is a community in transition, and not everyone agrees on 
the direction of the coming changes. Restaurateurs and other merchants along 
Milpas Street would welcome some of the elements that help tourist dollars flow 
on State Street: a low-priced shuttle bus, a narrower street, wider sidewalks, 
shady places to sit. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the area is far more than a Restaurant Row, it's also the place 
locals go for automobile services, construction yards, contractor offices, 
schools and social service agencies -- most of which would not benefit from 
slowing the traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, the Lower Eastside is the preferred place to have a business, and a 
drive along Milpas Street reveals far fewer vacant commercial spaces than are 
found on State Street. "The rents have taken a more sane path than those on 
State Street," said Errol Jahnke, a broker with Sunset Co. Realtors. "They 
didn't exceed reason." 
</P>
<P>
 Houses too are reasonable on the Lower Eastside, ranging from less than 
$175,000 for a fixer-upper to more than $400,000 for a view home near the 
Eastside hills known as the Lower Riviera. Lots and houses on the Lower 
Eastside tend to be small, but with its mountain views and ocean breezes, the 
area is considered a bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The Eastside) tends to be lower-priced, so there are more entry-level 
buyers," Jahnke said. "There are a lot of extended families buying real estate 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Danny Reyes, owner of Danny's Masonry, bought his Eastside home in 1967 for 
$19,500. Even though his house has appreciated at least tenfold, he has no 
plans to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's calm here," said Reyes, the father of eight children. "I've been in this 
neighborhood for 30 years and I've never been robbed or nothing like that. . . 
. I've been lucky. But it's also how you treat people."

 Since he bought his property, Reyes has transformed his yellow-and-white house 
by adding ornamental woodwork and by cultivating a garden bursting with roses, 
gladioli, geraniums, cactus, fruit trees and fragrant jasmine. "I've got a lot 
of work in it," Reyes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eastside has long been populated with people who take pride in their 
homes. "In the old days, it was Little Italy," said George Chellini, the 
recently retired executive director of the Boys and Girls Club of Santa Barbara 
County, who was born on the Eastside and went to school there. 
</P>
<P>
 "People worked as gardeners and stonemasons. Now that's changed over to 
Mexican stonemasons." That stonework is evident all over the Lower Eastside, in 
retaining walls, garden walls and even in whole buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 A few businesses owned by Italians in the early part of the century are still 
operating, including two restaurants -- Arnoldi's, which is housed in a stone 
building, and Mom's Italian Village. Both restaurants had boccie alleys in the 
1930s, '40s and '50s, Cellini said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eastside was formed in 1851, when State Street was created and bisected "a 
Mexican pueblo then in the process of changing into an American village," wrote 
the late historian, Walter A. Thompkins. Of course, like most of the Southern 
California coastal lands, the first inhabitants of Santa Barbara were the 
Chumash Indians, who lived in the area for at least 10,000 years. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Eastside youths are a big concern for many Santa Barbarans, who search for 
ways to keep kids out of gangs. One resource for youths is La Casa de la Raza, 
a center that serves as a nucleus for Latino culture and features heavily 
attended art shows, poetry readings, concerts and speakers. La Casa has a youth 
center and a drug-abuse prevention program, as well. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent meeting of the Eastside Study Group, the committee on youth drew 
the largest crowd. Some propose starting a clothing store run by youths for 
youths. Others suggest giving kids tours of local businesses to help inspire 
them toward more skilled careers than the fieldwork or hotel jobs held by their 
parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The number of immigrants coming, that's the big, big change," said Kevin 
Redick, a director of the Boys Club of Santa Barbara, located on the Lower 
Eastside. "There's a lot of transient families." 
</P>
<P>
 Redick and others hope that sports and other activities at the club will help 
kids stay out of gangs and trouble. The club also has a sprinkling of members 
from nearby Montecito, where wealthy parents want their children to interact 
with different cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are proud of the diversity we have," said Susanna Shreeve, a Montessori 
teacher with advanced college degrees, who has rented a small cottage on the 
Lower Eastside for several years. "I prefer diversity. I'm here because I don't 
like all-white. I like brown in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 The tiny cottages in Shreeve's neighborhood rent for $500 to $600 a month. 
Shreeve said she hasn't yet "found out how to live comfortably in these small 
rooms" and has to be out on her patio "to get any thinking done." But Shreeve's 
budget does not allow her to rent a larger place. "Rents are very hard on 
people in Santa Barbara," she said. "There are no secret little places to get 
low rent." 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Foster, the owner of several upscale clothing stores that bear her name, 
has lived on the downtown edge of the Lower Eastside for 25 years. The tiny, 
one-bedroom adobe home she shares with her husband, Pierre Lafond, is one of 
nine landmark homes in "El Caserio," which means "The Compound." 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be the Greenwich Village of Santa Barbara," Foster said of the 
area. Even today, her neighbors include the publisher of a local magazine and 
assorted artists. The 1920s-era houses in the compound, though small, sell for 
around $400,000 to $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she seems to be a woman with many choices in life, Foster has no 
desire to move to a fancier area of Santa Barbara, such as Montecito or Hope 
Ranch. On the Eastside, she feels closer to the fabric of her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can walk to the Botanic Garden, to the movies, to restaurants, to the 
farmer's market," Foster said. "And I just love that." At a Glance Population 
1993 estimate: 12,181

WRITER HOBHOUSE SETS GARDEN TALK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Friends of French Art is bringing Penelope Hobhouse, perhaps best known of all 
contemporary garden writers to Southern California to give an illustrated 
lecture at the Regency Club in Westwood on Feb. 16 at 6:30 p.m. The cost for 
this gourmet benefit dinner is $75 and the proceeds go to the Friends' 
restoration projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Color in Your Garden," "Flower Gardens," and "Garden Style" (all published by 
Little, Brown) are some of Hobhouse's recent books, all gloriously 
illustrated.Her most recent "Penelope Hobhouse's Gardening Through the Ages" 
(Simon & Schuster; $50) tells how plants have influenced garden design (a nice 
turnaround) and what plants were being grown in gardens at the time, which is 
also the subject of her talk. For further information, contact the Friends at 
(310) 377-4444.

YOUR MORTGAGE; RELIEF FOR QUAKE-BATTERED OWNERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT BOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Bond is a Los Angeles free-lance writer. 
</P>

<P>
 Mortgage relief and other help is available for homeowners who are suffering 
financial hardship as a result of the Northridge earthquake, according to 
spokesmen for a variety of government loan programs and commercial lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The kind of help available is determined by the type of loan: 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Housing Administration (FHA) loan. The FHA is offering rehabilitation 
loans for repairs to damaged homes, up to a maximum of $25,000. It is also 
lowering equity requirements and liberalizing down payments for refinancings 
that include repairs to damaged homes, according to Nick Retsinas, an assistant 
commissioner with the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
</P>
<P>
 FHA mortgages are available to any qualified borrower up to a maximum of 
$151,725. FHA, a division of the Department of Housing and Urban Development, 
does not make the loan. Rather, it insures lenders in event of borrower 
defaults and foreclosures. 
</P>
<P>
 Department of Veterans Affairs (DVA). This federal agency is active in four 
specific ways, according to DVA Secretary Jesse Brown. They are: 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- Offering the local DVA inventory of foreclosed properties to the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for use by those rendered homeless from 
destruction of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- Placing a hold on closings for properties in escrow, pending assessment 
of damages and possible renegotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- Expediting tapping into life insurance cash values for veterans needing 
cash in a hurry, accomplishing this in as little as three days. 
</P>
<P>
 4 -- Placing a 90-day moratorium on foreclosures. 
</P>
<P>
 This type of financing is available only to qualified veterans, generally for 
up to a maximum of $184,000, to purchase a residence. Also called GI or VA 
loans, these are not insured, but guaranteed, by the DVA. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal National Mortgage Assn. (FNMA). Fannie Mae is offering five special 
relief efforts to assist homeowners experiencing hardships from the quake, 
according to spokesman Tom Marder. They are: 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- Waive late payment charges. 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- Extend forbearance through temporary suspension of loan repayments. 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- Modify the loan in some form, such as through extending the term for 
repayment. 
</P>
<P>
 4 -- Not reporting delinquencies to TRW and other credit bureaus. 
</P>
<P>
 5 -- Assisting borrowers with evaluating quake damages, filing insurance 
claims and expediting disbursements of funds to which they may be entitled. 
</P>
<P>
 Fannie Mae is not a lender, but a purchaser of mortgages through what is known 
as the secondary market, up to a maximum of $203,150 for a single dwelling, 
including condos, townhouses and co-ops. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (FHLMC). Freddie Mac is asking its mortgage 
loan servicers to provide forbearance services to borrowers whose homes have 
been damaged or destroyed in a variety of ways, said spokeswoman Nancy Condon. 
They are: 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- Suspend collection, foreclosure and eviction proceedings for up to 90 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- Work out delinquent mortgage assumptions, pre-foreclosure sales, short 
payoffs, charge-offs or deed in lieu of foreclosure arrangements. 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- Assist quake victims with the loss-of-use clause where applicable. 
</P>
<P>
 4 -- Help qualified borrowers whose loans are not delinquent to obtain 
insurance advances of as much as 10% of the outstanding mortgage balance to buy 
building materials 
</P>
<P>
 5 -- Check out the licensing status and qualifications of any contractors to 
be involved with repairing or rehabilitating the property. 
</P>
<P>
 Freddie Mac is not a lender, but, like Fannie Mae, buys mortgage through the 
secondary market, up to a maximum of $203,150 for homes, including a condos, 
townhouse and co-op. 
</P>
<P>
 California Department of Veterans Affairs (Cal-Vet). All contract holders, as 
the purchaser is called, are insured for the guaranteed replacement cost 
against structural damage, equaling the insurance coverage, a spokesman said. 
Homeowners should contact the nearest Cal-Vet office for disaster claim forms 
and processing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cal-Vet program is available to all qualified veterans for the purchase of 
homes with a maximum loan of $198,750 in Los Angeles and $210,800 in Ventura 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Conventional loans from portfolio lenders. Although there is no concerted 
effort to provide relief efforts by direct lenders, borrowers victimized by the 
quake should contact their respective lenders to work out forbearance plans.

<P>
 * Earthquakes affect the heaviest parts of the house the most. Masonry 
fireplaces are very heavy, weighing from 1 to 3 tons on a single-story home. 
</P>
<P>
 * Self-contained metal fireplaces, the so-called "zero-clearance" types, are 
much lighter, weighing from 400 to 625 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Most new houses now are being built with zero-clearance fireplaces, which 
are lightweight and more flexible in a quake than traditional masonry 
fireplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 * Metal chimney flues will sway, without toppling over and are less inclined 
to pull away from a building. Masonry doesn't bend, it breaks, whereas metal is 
more flexible. 
</P>
<P>
 * Building a fireplace with a masonry firebox and a metal chimney is possible 
and combines the best of both worlds -- a big firebox and a lightweight 
chimney. But it is imperative that the metal pipe be approved for high 
temperatures that can be generated by a masonry firebox. 
</P>
<P>
 * Metalbestos is a widely used type of metal chimney flue that is approved to 
1700 degrees. It is constructed of stainless steel inside and out, with no 
asbestos in it and can be used with masonry fireboxes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Zero-clearance metal fireplaces use galvanized chimney flues, which must be 
enclosed, usually framed in wood and insulated. This type of metal flue should 
not be used on a masonry firebox. 
</P>
<P>
 * To install metal fireplaces, contractors must have a C-61 license.

CALL OF THE LAST WILDERNESS; LEAVING CIVILIZATION FAR BEHIND IN THE ALASKAN 
ARCTIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We glass the ridgeline ahead with binoculars, looking for wolf. They roam up 
where the breeze is fresh and the tundra dry and where they can see for 100 
miles. We know this becauseon the brow of the promontories they leave behind 
gnawed bones and hairy scat, piles of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, where else would you go but up high if you were a wolf and these were 
the dog days of summer and this was your domain? 
</P>
<P>
 Temporary wanderers into this timelessness, we see no wolf right now. But 
hmmm. Something's moving on the ridgeline. 
</P>
<P>
 First, wide-set, wobbling ears emerge over the crest. Then a big dish face 
with a snout big as a stovepipe ahead of shaggy, rippling shoulders. A blonde 
barren-ground grizzly is on the move. And her shambling, zigzag course is 
bringing her our way. 
</P>
<P>
 She is followed by he -- a larger, darker bear hard on her heels. This is July 
on the North Slope of the Brooks Range mountains in northeast Alaska and 
already courtship has begun. The big boar will follow the coy sow for days, 
perhaps weeks, and then she -- perhaps -- will acknowledge his interest. Why, 
Ed, aren't you looking exceedingly robust today? 
</P>
<P>
 Until then they move in lonely tandem, busily scraping a living from the roots 
and rodents of the tundra. And grabbing off the larger stuff when it's handy. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, I should mention the two bears are still coming our way, and more 
or less directly so. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in the Arctic, beyond where trees break the vista, we live in our 
binoculars. And a good rule of thumb when omnivores are closer than 8-power 
range: Make way, while you can. 
</P>
<P>
 We do, and retreat a quarter-mile before the bears can see or overtake us. 
</P>
<P>
 When we look back, a little bear, maybe a 2-year-old on its first summer away 
from home, is flushed out by the larger bears and dashes up the hillside. The 
little bear seems to have been sitting on a cache of some kind, perhaps the 
meat of a kill, and seems reluctant to venture too far. Nervously, it lurks on 
high ground, and like us, tries to plot the course of those who hold a more 
favored place on the food chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Awhile later, a fourth bear -- it looks like another boar -- wanders into the 
scene from the left. Maybe he has some courtship action in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 By now, we have to name the bears so we can whisper about them as we watch. "I 
think Little Britches is coming back down the hill . . . ." "Look, I think 
Lefty is a little discouraged after he saw the size of Big Ed . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Someone from our group takes a glance behind us. Across the Kongakut River is 
a fifth bear, galumphing across a tundra slope. 
</P>
<P>
 So, you say you want to get away from the hurley-burley and spend some time in 
the natural world? 
</P>
<P>
 This is as far away and as wild as one can go in the U.S. We are on the eighth 
day of a 10-day float down the Kongakut River, near the border with the 
Canadian Yukon, and except for our troupe of 10, we have seen more bears, 
wolverines, foxes, Dall sheep, caribou, moose and eagles than people. We 
haven't caught sight of a wolf, but have stopped along the river and listened 
to one's melodious howl, our skin prickling at the truest call of the wild. 
</P>
<P>
 Across a side creek from our camp, two primitive-looking musk oxen crash 
through chest-high willow thickets. One is a juvenile with flapjack ears in the 
shape of Mr. Spock's. The other is a mature bull with a proud, shaggy coat that 
hangs and sways like a grass skirt. 
</P>
<P>
 And nature doesn't stop with that. Nearby, a low-slung wolverine raids a fox 
den and emerges with a pup in its jaws. Mom and dad fox fill the air with 
tormented squalls and give chase, snapping at the waddling intruder without 
avail. One fox is black, the other red. The chase takes them over the horizon. 
Only red returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Our guide, Macgill Adams, foreman of his own Anchorage-based Wilderness Alaska 
outfitters, is spending his 15th summer here. Today is the wildlife highlight 
of our trip, a record-book day by any measure. We are drained, uplifted, 
astonished, mesmerized and not apt to sleep so soundly in the company of what 
is literally a ton of live grizzly bears. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great wide-open place and there are no guard rails," says Adams, 
smiling. He arches his eyebrows. "And, oh my, I forgot my ruby slippers." 
</P>
<P>
 We gather under a tarp sometime around midnight. Why look at your watch when 
you're far above the Arctic Circle under 24 hours of daylight? One of our three 
rafts is hoisted on its side for a wind break. Macgill fixes a tub of guacamole 
and chips, and passes a flagon of tequila. This is followed by steak fajitas 
the size of the Sunday paper. For dessert, strawberry cheesecake. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuffed and tired, we sit on five-gallon buckets, absorbing the absolute 
stillness of this remaining heritage of America's authentic remoteness. And we 
listen to the satisfied inner voice that whispers congratulations to each of us 
for our wisdom in coming. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
 From my notebook that day: "This is the standard by which all other holidays 
will be judged -- and judged short." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most everyone has a favorite place in the outdoors, where air and sky and 
water renew the spirit, calm the soul. And in extreme places like this, the 
outdoors, at least for a moment, touches more deeply our unsatisfied and 
primitive human yearning for space. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arctic. It ignites imagination with its forbidding, which, yes, it can be. 
But not always. Space and scale here in the refuge portion of the Brooks Range 
is incomprehensible and (so far) untamed -- 19 million acres sharp from the 
chisel of creation -- sheer rock mountains, epic tundra foothills and a vast, 
treeless plain leading to the Beaufort Sea. No roads, no bridges, no man-made 
trails. Proof, if necessary, that a place needs plenty of room to be wild. 
</P>
<P>
 As this is being written, I can report that during the last 12 months I've 
spent more than one day of 10 here on rivers of the North Slope of the Arctic 
National Wildlife Refuge with Macgill Adams. And that's not enough, yet. More 
than half of those who have accompanied us are planning their returns, 
including me. 
</P>
<P>
 Easiest to tell are our stories of the bears and falcons, the warm sun on 
rivers whose banks still hold ice, the fossil rocks, the wildflowers tiny as 
gemstones, the forbidden cliff faces that have never known piton or hammer, the 
tundra plants which reach out to capture and hold precious droplets of rain -- 
the things we see. More subtle, personal and, ultimately, more profound are the 
sensations of casting loose to achieve such latitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of us on this 10-day trip have been in the Brooks Range before. Others 
have not camped out since childhood. We all came by word of mouth or through 
tiny ads in outdoor publications. Adams is one of a small clan of Brooks Range 
naturalist guides with the mastery, sensibility, drive, muscle and ego to, year 
after year, open the Arctic curtain for people who otherwise would never 
venture so far north. 
</P>
<P>
 At the airport in Fairbanks, we become separated from our delusions of 
controlling our lives -- and the faster the better, so we can fling ourselves 
at discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 A single-engine charter carries us about 240 miles to the Athabascan Indian 
settlement of Arctic Village, population 150. A smaller bush plane then 
shuttles us 45 minutes over the Continental Divide in twos and threes to a 
gravel bar landing strip on the Kongakut where we will launch our 14-foot 
boats. The process takes all day. 
</P>
<P>
 We put on the water at 10:30 p.m. in a driving storm, with fat rain pellets 
drumming hard on our eyeballs. To a person, we are euphoric. 
</P>
<P>
 Some days we float, some we hike and some we do a little of both. Our 
movements are determined not by a clock or a schedule but by our moods, by the 
scenery, the weather. These are primordial, honest cadences with a logic too 
many of us have forgotten but which are quickly re-established. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Adams is besieged with questions: How far have we floated today? How 
high is that peak? What is the temperature? How much does that bear weigh? 
</P>
<P>
 He shakes his head. Part of truly getting away is liberating ourselves from 
this kind of slavish box-score accounting. So he answers thus: We floated a 
long way today. That mountain is pretty dog-gone high. The temperature feels 
warm enough to wear shorts, don't you think? And, that is one big son-of-a-gun 
of a bear. 
</P>
<P>
 Flabby muscles throb. Appetites go crazy. And our sense of wonder, stale from 
urban routine, swells larger each day, at every bend of the river, with every 
knoll hiked, under every sudden change in weather, by every scan of distant 
ridges. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 None of us would say it's an easy trip. Wonderful, full of discovery, but not 
easy. For every uplifting moment of wonder, there is a corresponding spell of 
self-doubt. But if we could chart our emotions on an oscilloscope, we'd find in 
our wake almost none of those flat, modulated moments which relentlessly 
consume our otherwise measured lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a seasoned hand like Adams, to our surprise, relinquishes himself to 
euphoric ups and introspective downs that are the rhythms of the wild. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the trip, a couple of miles of Class II rock gardens could surge to 
Class III in higher water, but even our heavily loaded, underpowered paddle 
rafts take the stream easily. The water is spring clear and icy, and is some of 
the last in the world where you dare plunge your face in and gulp it raw and 
untreated. 
</P>
<P>
 Our downhill course will take us 55 miles. We start deep back in the Brooks 
Range, surrounded by imposing, multicolored rock mountains, and we float north 
for several days through a broad-shouldered, winding valley, exploring side 
canyons along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Later the mountains will lose their ragged tops and we will be in foothills, 
which from afar seem covered in velvet. Up close, we see it is tundra, the 
complex mat of lumpy, clumpy, spongy, often soggy, ankle-wrenching vegetation 
that insulates the ice below from the sun above during the short 50-odd days of 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 We conclude our trip where the hills come to rest on the empty vastness of the 
coastal plain, the summer home and calving grounds for more than 150,000 
caribou. We miss their passing migration by only a couple of days, but the air 
still has a faint barnyard bouquet. 
</P>
<P>
 From a nob, our group looks out onto the Arctic Ocean and the far-off ice 
pack. Heat waves shimmer from horizon to horizon across a plain as empty and 
rich and wondrous as Kansas in 1820. 
</P>
<P>
 We hear a buzz that for a change is not a mosquito. A bush plane bounces to a 
stop on our tundra shelf. Outbound adventurers are shuttled to the oil-field 
airport of Deadhorse at Prudhoe Bay, to the west, for a jetliner connection 
back to Fairbanks.  
</P>
<P>
 Too fast, the world of engines and stoplights and telephones and money is 
there with its imposing greetings. With the endless Arctic summer days, 
tonight's sunset will be the first anyone has seen in 10 days and the darkness 
carries a melancholy gloom. The wild is something you can sample, but you 
cannot bring home. Mosquito Madness 
</P>
<P>
 They are spooky, as dense in the Arctic as anywhere I've been, which includes 
the Amazon Basin. But the challenge proves more mental than physical. 
</P>
<P>
 Repellents with 25%-30% concentrations of the chemical Deet will keep 
mosquitoes from biting. (The 100% stuff is hard on your skin and your gear, and 
in my experience gains you nothing.) Tight-weave, loose-fitting nylon pants and 
jackets keep them off your body. For the worst days of our trip, we donned mesh 
jackets (sold under the Bug Armor or Shoo-Bug brand names) soaked in Deet. 
That's the physical part. 
</P>
<P>
 But mosquitoes still buzz in your face and swirl in clouds 20 feet high during 
peak summer season. Huffing up a hill, you'll breath a few. Look in your soup 
cup and you'll find that you're eating a few. Bathing in the ice water of the 
Kongakut River is hard enough, but also exposes tender flesh faster than you 
can spray bug dope. Ditto when using the, ah, facilities. All this is the 
mental part. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds awful, but we all adjusted. By the end, the bugs were a nuisance, not a 
nightmare. Everyone brought a head net, but after a day or two, they were 
stowed at the bottom of the gear bag. GUIDEBOOK

 Adventures North of the Arctic Circle 
</P>
<P>
 Getting there: Alaska Airlines and Delta have direct flights from LAX to 
Fairbanks. United offers connecting flights to Fairbanks out of LAX, Alaska 
Airlines a connecting flight out of Burbank. Round-trip fares start at $445, 
advance purchase. Bush plane shuttles in and out are arranged by guides. 
</P>
<P>
 Clothing: Hardly ever is good gear more important than in the Arctic. Rain, 
fog, 40-degree wind-swept cold, 80-degree sun with no shade for 150 miles, 
mosquitoes, boggy tundra, sharp scree rock -- you get it all in extremes, and 
not uncommonly, in a single day. The only solution is layers and lightweight 
synthetics such as Capilene and fleece, which are best because they resist 
moisture. For rain gear, an impenetrable cagaoule , or long anorak, sailing 
bibs and high rubber boots are standard. 
</P>
<P>
 Choosing a guide: I would only travel with a guide after speaking first to 
people who had been on previous trips with him or her. Compare Arctic 
experience, the tempo of trips, food, naturalist skills, group size, equipment. 
Confirm with the guide whether he or she will lead the trip or contract it out 
to someone else. Try to connect with a trip where everyone has similar physical 
abilities and goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the Arctic's unique flora, fauna, character, weather extremes and 
remoteness, I place my trust in those one-person guide companies who specialize 
in trips in the region rather than those larger, contract operations that 
provide adventure travel elsewhere. The Arctic specialists know best the local 
bush pilots on whose shoulders your trip depends. They know the right gear. 
They know the birds and wildflowers of the tundra. They are willing to 
accommodate your special interests.

HOWLING CONTROVERSY OVER WOLF-KILLING AND BOYCOTT; TOURISM: EVEN THOSE OPPOSED 
TO 'WOLF MANAGEMENT,' DISAGREE ON HOW TO STOP THE PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER; Balzar is Seattle bureau chief for The 
Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once again, the actions and values of citizens in one state have kicked up a 
fury outside, and the controversial stratagem of a tourism boycott hangs over 
the holiday visitor season. 
</P>
<P>
 Previously, the issue was gay rights in Colorado. At present, it's wolf 
protection in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as then, those angry with the state disagree strongly among themselves 
about whether a boycott is the proper response, or one likely to damage the 
wrong targets. 
</P>
<P>
 The background: Alaska hunters want more caribou to put in their freezers. 
They believe a thriving predator population is keeping some caribou herds in 
the interior of Alaska from reaching maximum size. In particular, a 
Connecticut-sized chunk of spruce forests and foothills south of Fairbanks has 
been off limits to hunters for a couple of years because of a sparse caribou 
population. But it is not off limits to bears and wolves. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists and animal rights activists see a perfectly natural cycle 
underway and see no need for human interference. Caribou herds fluctuate 
dramatically in size, and there are plenty of the animals in more remote parts 
of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 But local hunters are less patient. Flexing their political muscle, last year 
they successfully urged the state to undertake the snaring and shooting of up 
to 80% of the wolves in this region to speed up the growth of the caribou herd. 
The wolf kill began with the first snowfall of winter. Up to 150 wolves are 
destined to die, strangled by neck snares or shot while they writhe in the 
traps. Hunters braced for a struggle, anticipating the reaction in the Lower 49 
would be outrage.  
</P>
<P>
 And it has been. Animal protection organizations such as Connecticut-based 
Friends of Animals and the Fund for Animals in Washington, D.C., with the 
support of some Alaska environmentalists, called for a tourism boycott in 
January. If the wolf kill is not stopped now, they believe, it will spread and 
increase in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
 They have taken out advertisements urging Americans to spend their travel 
money elsewhere. And, maybe more importantly, they rallied support via the 
lively network that animal rights supporters maintain among themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a last resort. But we've exhausted all other efforts to halt this 
killing," says Wayne Pacelle, director of Cleveland Amory's powerful Fund for 
Animals, based in Washington, D.C. "Cold, hard cash is the only thing this 
governor will understand." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in 1992, a brief call for a tourism boycott from animal rights groups 
resulted in Alaska Gov. Walter J. Hickel backing away from a plan to have 
wolves shot from the air. At the time, tourism officials openly worried. Some 
said the impact on Alaska's No. 3 employer, the travel industry, could be worse 
than the Exxon Valdez oil spill of 1989.  
</P>
<P>
 But the hunters persisted, and this time Hickel says he is not going to budge. 
The killing of wolves will continue. "We believe the state has a right and a 
responsibility to manage its wildlife resources," says spokesman John Manly. 
</P>
<P>
 Manly expresses hope that curiosity about the controversy may actually prove a 
boon to travel here. "We think more will be interested in coming than will be 
put off by our wolf management program." 
</P>
<P>
 At least some environmental groups who disagree with Hickel on most everything 
else are hoping so -- they want the boycott to fail. They argue that a trip to 
Alaska will energize more Americans to come to the wolf's rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 Groups like the Sierra Club oppose the wolf kill and at the same time sponsor 
many wilderness trips to Alaska. They have come out strongly against the 
boycott. And the scores of Alaska guides and small-scale outfitters who 
specialize in eco-tourism in Alaska say they feel particularly vulnerable. 
They, too, oppose the wolf kill. And they recognize that their natural clients 
are the most likely to respond to save-the-wolves appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the abbreviated 1992 boycott threat cut their business 10% while it 
apparently had no measurable effect on the cruise ship and tour bus business. 
</P>
<P>
 To try to fight back, the Sierra Club and the Alaska Wilderness Recreation and 
Tourism Assn. launched an advertising campaign last week with the slogan: 
"Alaska Needs Its Wolves. Now The Wolves Need Us." 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition urges visitors to select trips and spend money in Alaska with 
those who oppose the wolf reduction plan. "Visit Alaska, Get Involved, Stop the 
Killing," the ads say. 
</P>
<P>
 Mainline tourism companies and state tourism officials appear to be quietly 
accepting the wolf reduction program. 
</P>
<P>
 Alaska hunters believe the controversy is so much emotional hype. They point 
out that wolves are not endangered in Alaska, like elsewhere in America. And 
they believe many Americans have confused this plan for wolf reduction with 
wolf eradication, which is not the aim. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, they note, the Alaska State Constitution provides for the management 
of wildlife for the benefit of human hunters. In the harsh climate of the Far 
North, hunting is one of the traditional pastimes and rewards, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Some hunters believe that urban Americans are not being honest with themselves 
in the debate. After all, many city dwellers freely eat beef and lamb, which 
are raised across great tracts of American land where ranchers have displaced 
many varieties of natural predators. Up to 90,000 coyotes, for instance, are 
killed in the U.S. each year to protect sheep flocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way we live here is much more in tune with the outdoors and the 
environment," says Mary Bishop, a Fairbanks hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 Right now is the peak booking season for the short summer. Officially, both 
sides are calmly claiming gains. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our reaction has been enormous," says Pacelle of the Fund for Animals. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's spokesman, Manly, responds: "We've heard no dire reports on the 
impact of the boycott." 
</P>

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; FUR, FESTIVALS AND BEAR WATCHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even those who love the winter begin to weary of the white stuff by February, 
especially in Alaska, where galloping cases of cabin fever are common about 
now. That could be why so many festivals and blues busters are scheduled 
throughout the state this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest and best known is the Fur Rendezvous in Anchorage, a terrific 
place to meet and mingle with Alaskans. The festival, scheduled to start Friday 
and run through Feb. 20, recalls the era when fur trappers and gold miners, 
escapingwinter's grip, came to the "big town" to replenish their supplies and 
get rowdy for a few days. 
</P>
<P>
 They'd race their dog-sled teams, auction off their caribou skins and otter 
pelts, and grab a saloon girl for a fling. 
</P>
<P>
 Revived in 1936, the festival has been held annually ever since. Today about 
140 different events are scheduled, including the Miners and Trappers Ball, a 
gigantic masquerade party that limits tickets to 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The action isn't confined to Anchorage. Elsewhere in the state, residents will 
be battling winter blues with the Iceworm Festival in Cordova, the Peninsula 
Winter Games on the Kenai Peninsula, the Beaver Round-Up in Dillingham and the 
Tent City Festival in Wrangell. For more information,call (907) 465-2010. As 
March nears, all eyes will be on the Iditarod Sled Dog Race, which begins March 
5 after participating mushers draw for starting positions at the March 3 
Mushers Banquet. This year's 1,049-mile race welcomes back several veterans, 
including last year's winner, Jeff King, and second-place finisher, Dee Dee 
Jonrowe. For information, call (907) 376-5155.  
</P>
<P>
 This is also the time to apply for permits to view Alaska's brown bears this 
summer. The routine varies from site to site but all have two things in common: 
Interest is high and space is limited. 
</P>
<P>
 Deadline for applications is March 1 at McNeil River State Game Sanctuary on 
the upper Alaska Peninsula. Call (907) 267-2180 for forms and permit 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pack Creek bear viewing area on Admiralty Island National Monument begins 
accepting reservation requests on March 1. Write Forest Service Information 
Center, 101 Egan Drive, Juneau, Alaska 99801. 
</P>
<P>
 Permits are not required at Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge where, for the 
first time, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has turned over bear-viewing to 
Munsey's O'Malley Camp. Reservations for four-day tours are on a first-come, 
first-served basis. Cost is $1,400 per person, inclusive. Call (913) 392-2348 
for information. 
</P>
<P>
 At Brooks Fall in Katmai National Park on the Alaska Peninsula, permits are 
not required but campsites fill up fast. They are issued on a first-come, 
first-served basis. Call (907) 246-3305. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, if you'd rather look at things celestial, you might catch one of 
Alaska's most spectacular sights simply by looking up: the Northern Lights. The 
aurora borealis, the magnetically charged bands of color, often dance across 
Arctic skies on clear winter nights.

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; LONDON ARTS AT YOUR FINGERTIPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time, travelers to London can buy tickets to plays, musicals, 
operas, concerts, museums and galleries with one telephone call under the 
auspices of a two-month promotion called London Arts Season. 
</P>
<P>
 Now through the end of March, it's one-stop shopping for more than 100 venues. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the offerings include a major Picasso exhibit at the Tate Gallery, a 
comprehensive Faberge show at the Victoria and Albert Museum, the musicals 
"Crazy for You" and "Sunset Boulevard," and Tom Stoppard's comedy, "Arcadia." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, visitors may book seats for the Royal Ballet and Opera, Royal 
National Theatre, the London Philharmonic, London Symphony and English Chamber 
orchestras, Royal Shakespeare Company and English National Opera. 
</P>
<P>
 Ease of access and availability of hard-to-get seats are the main selling 
points of London Arts Season, which receives daily ticket allocations from many 
venues. (Most ticket prices are not discounted.) In addition, promotion 
sponsors have arranged several backstage tours, special presentations and 
opportunities to meet the casts of shows such as "Starlight Express" and 
"Cats." 
</P>
<P>
 Details are spelled out in a booklet that is available from the British 
Tourist Authority at (213) 628-3525. Travelers can obtain tickets by calling 
London Arts direct (011-44-71-396-4567) or by calling Edwards & Edwards, a New 
York City ticket agency, at (800) 223-6108. Booking fees may be charged on some 
tickets. In London, travelers may also go to the London Arts information center 
at 12 Regent St. SW1, near Piccadilly Circus.

TREADING SOFTLY; A HIGH SIERRA SNOWSHOE SHUFFLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, Epstein is a Costa Mesa-based free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For most people, snowshoeing calls to mind grizzled fur-trappers with French 
accents traversing the Yukon avoiding ze bair while in search of pelts of bee 
vair. But when my wife Kathleen and I found ourselves making like Pierre and 
Lulu in the Far North -- of California, that is -- we were in fact retracing 
some of the steps of pioneer scout Kit Carson on the first east-to-west Sierra 
crossing. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that we'd planned it that way. And not that Kit Carson could ever possibly 
have looked like us, limbs akimbo, our initial rhythmic flailing eventually 
settling into, well, permanent rhythmic flailing. 
</P>
<P>
 No, what we'd originally planned was an extended weekend ski trip. I've 
visited literally dozens of ski resorts since I began skiing a decade ago, and 
Kirkwood, southeast of South Lake Tahoe near Carson Pass, stood out as having 
provided one of my most fun days ever. I'd been trying to get back ever since, 
and this year I wasn't going to let it get away from me. My wife and I arranged 
for a leisurely arrival and three full days at the resort; her only stipulation 
was that the trip not be devoted solely to skiing, that one of the three days 
we try something entirely different. Perhaps she was thinking about a sleigh 
ride. 
</P>
<P>
 We flew into Reno Airport in early January, picked up our rental car and began 
the 77-mile drive to Kirkwood. We'd chosen the least expensive condominium, and 
awaiting us at the 52-unit Meadows was a decidedly functional studio, with a 
Murphy bed and no hangers, but with a fireplace and kitchen that made it 
perfect for romantic evenings in. (South Lake Tahoe accommodations are also 
within easy striking distance, 30 miles, and often more economical.)  
</P>
<P>
 We prepared our own meals -- an elaborate salade Nic oise one night, for 
example, and the best spare ribs of our lives together -- and experimented with 
Australian cabernets we'd found in a Carson City supermarket on the drive down. 
 
</P>
<P>
 At 7,800 feet, Kirkwood Ski Resort boasts the highest base elevation of any 
Tahoe resort. It's a family-style place; junior night life includes a slam dunk 
competition, and two lifts serve beginners' terrain exclusively. Some prices 
had been markedly reduced since my visit several seasons ago. A first-time 
skier package, for example, including lift ticket, rentals and clinic -- the 
word lesson is studiously avoided -- has gone down from $40 to $25. Clinics, 
once $18, are now $12. 
</P>
<P>
 On our first day, I explored all lifts save the double-black-diamond Wagon 
Wheel, figuring I still had two days to screw up my courage. Careening up and 
down the walls of Kirkwood's gullies was a blast. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, when Kathleen was out of town, I'd attended a slide 
presentation on snowshoeing at a local outfitters store. Not to mix metaphors 
too liberally, I was pretty hot to try my, um, foot at the sport, and so it was 
that we shoe-horned a day between two others on the slopes. We began it by 
making a beeline for Kirkwood's Cross Country Center. The snowshoes, $10 per 
day, were one-size-fits-all; poles came with the package. 
</P>
<P>
 The old wooden snowshoes were wide and heavy, up to 10 pounds, and basically 
awkward. Newer aluminum-and-Hypalon models such as those we wore can be less 
than two pounds, and agile enough to run races. Indeed, there are more than 50 
snowshoe races in the U.S. this season, most notably Alaska's 100-mile 
"Iditashoe." If you can walk, you can snowshoe, so there was no need for 
lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 We drove along frozen Caples Lake, out on the middle of which we spotted a fox 
sizing up fish through a hole in the ice, and past the turn-off to the 
Schneider Cow Camp, to Carson Pass at 8,573 feet. We parked at the Sno-Park, 
and immediately knew we'd come to the right place, for there was a monument to 
"Snowshoe Thom(p)son," a.k.a. John Tostensen, "a true pioneer." Thom(p)son -- 
the spelling of his name is a matter of contention -- carried U.S. mail in 
winter over routes impassable by horse or wagon. 
</P>
<P>
 We entered the Mokelumne Wilderness at the Carson Pass trail head. Signs 
warned about avalanche danger and described our itinerary as a 10-kilometer 
loop. We agreed that we could turn back at any point. Descending into the 
forest, we saw no bear tracks, but any number of huge cat paws. We almost 
immediately lost sight of distinctive Elephants Back mountain, and 
simultaneously any sense of orientation. We were not exactly old hands with a 
topographic map, and choosing the right trail often proved tricky. 
</P>
<P>
 But somebody must have known that, for blue diamond cross-country markers, and 
blue ribbons tied to tree branches, helped us find our way. We followed them 
and were occasionally reassured by snowshoe tracks coming back in the other 
direction. Of course, those could have been Snowshoe Thom(p)son's, for all we 
knew. 
</P>
<P>
 My snowshoeing technique could certainly have stood some fine-tuning, since I 
fell not once, not twice, but three times, in each case the toe of one shoe 
becoming ensnared half way up the the heel of the other. (It turns out the 
shoes can easily be adjusted for us pigeon-toed folks.) My wife experienced no 
such problems. We had figured that snowshoeing might be grueling, but the 
exertion proved similar to that of any hike. And as might be expected on any 
hike in any season, quick gains in elevation required the greatest effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The trail suddenly opened onto an incredible vista. We were an hour out, and 
it seemed the perfect time for a PowerBar: "fuel for optimum performance," the 
package proclaimed. Unfortunately, the bars were too cold to bite into, but 
they gradually thawed in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We turned another corner and Elephants Back suddenly loomed before us, 
resembling less an elephant's back than that of a humpback whale. As we made 
our way along its base, the wind-swept slopes of snow offered imprints similar 
to those left by waves at the seashore. We sat down on a rock and looked out on 
an environment undisturbed by motion in any direction, and confident in our 
notion that we were the only people as far as the eye could see. That notion 
was presently dispelled when two cross-country skiers skied up, just in time to 
take our photo with Round Top Peak in the background. 
</P>
<P>
 For those so inclined, the summit of Elephants Back, a couple hundred feet 
above, appeared an easy walk up the south flank. Since we didn't know what lay 
ahead, it seemed to come down to a choice between taking a leisurely lunch and 
soaking in the utter perfection of the moment, or continuing our hike.  
</P>
<P>
 We were awfully happy nestled there, and such moments are not to be taken 
lightly. We enjoyed our picnic in the snow, peppered turkey pastrami sandwiches 
and fruit, delicious out of all proportion. Perhaps if we'd known then that 
Carson and Lt. John Fremont had actually climbed Elephants Back, and from that 
vantage Carson had recognized mountains bordering the coast that allowed him to 
chart the party's course to Sutter's Fort, we'd have decided otherwise. And 
perhaps not. 
</P>
<P>
 On our return trip, a firm sense of direction established, following a trail 
seemed decidedly less crucial. We winged it across an expanse of white until at 
tree line -- in this case a stark boundary between forest and slope -- we 
espied a tiny blue diamond marking our way home.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead of walking on the packed snow of the cross-country trail, however, we 
continued to break our own trail through the woods, making an endless 
succession of what every alpine skier dreams of, fresh tracks in virgin powder. 
Relatively loud on hard pack, the shoes now proved far quieter. With Kathleen 
in the lead, I watched the snow fly from side to side in a motion that lent her 
the air of a happily waddling duck. 
</P>
<P>
 Exiting the trail head, we noticed another marker buried in several feet of 
snow. I could just make out "Carson," and proceeded to dig it out: "On this 
spot . . . stood what was known as the Kit Carson tree, on which the famous 
scout inscribed his name in 1844." 
</P>
<P>
 I also more closely examined the obelisk to Snowshoe Thom(p)son, erected as 
part of bicentennial projects by Nevada members "of the ancient and honorable E 
Clampus Vitus ." Among chapters listed as donors was the Transierra Roisterous 
Alliance of Senior Humbugs, whose acronym apparently would be TRASH. 
</P>
<P>
 When our third morning dawned, Kirkwood's Wagon Wheel lift still beckoned, and 
courage high, sort of, I rode it up. I also skied down, sort of. Budget for Two

WHAT'S IN STORE FOR TRAVEL STORAGE

 Like building a better mousetrap, the search for better products for carrying 
travel gear is an endless quest. Whether it's jewelry, maps or just loose 
stuff, it's always nice to find a new approach to hauling hard-to-organize 
belongings. Herewith, items to hold a variety of travel basics, including a 
neat new option for storing and viewing photographs. Prices exclude shipping 
and handling. 
</P>
<P>
 Found: the perfect case for the woman who travels with a stash of jewelry. 
This 7-by-5-by-2 1/2-inch suede, zippered jewel pouch from T. Anthony, a New 
York store that specializes in leather accessories, has a place for everything. 
The large open compartment has ample space for bracelets, broaches and other 
larger baubles, and there's a snap-off ring holder and a sewn-in strip for 
attaching pierced earrings. A small zippered pocket on the inside of the lid 
can hold slim items or receipts for goodies bought on the go, and a removable 
three-pocket zippered section can store particularly delicate items 
individually to avoid scratching. This gorgeous case doesn't come cheap, but 
it's one of the most efficient (and classy) solutions for toting jewelry I've 
seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Travel Jewel Pouch (Item No. 1478) is $155 in fuchsia, royal blue and aqua 
Nu-Buck suede from T. Anthony; tel. (800) 722-2406.  
</P>
<P>
 On a more budget-minded tack, Sassaby, a California manufacturer, makes 
brightly colored plastic cosmetic organizers designed to appeal especially to 
young women. I liked the sturdy compact case, which at 6 1/4-by-4 1/2-by-2 1/2 
inches, is large enough to store a small powder compact, lipstick, mascara, 
makeup pencils and other basics for a quick touch-up. Behind a mirrored middle 
section (released by squeezing a latch) is still more space for keys, a note 
pad or other small items.  
</P>
<P>
 Sassaby Compact with mirrored compartment in purple, blue or green (No. 110) 
is $4.99 at cosmetic counters of department stores . For a store in your area, 
call the manufacturer; tel. (800) 468-7277.  
</P>
<P>
 Keeping items neatly arranged in a car often is an exercise in futility -- but 
it needn't be if you've got this useful nylon organizer that hooks onto the 
back of a seat via flexible metal hangers. Five mesh pockets of varying sizes 
are ideal for maps, guidebooks, a flashlight, cassette players and tapes, and 
other handy items that otherwise might get lost under a seat or mangled under a 
heavy foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Car Organizer in red (No. 815622) or black (No. 628129) is $9.98 from Lillian 
Vernon, a mail-order company; tel. (800) 285-5555.  
</P>
<P>
 Shoes often either get damaged or do damage to other items in a suitcase. 
These tartan-colored cotton flannel shoe bags can protect both the shoes and 
the rest of your clothes. The bags also keep the shoes together so you don't 
end up finding one shoe, with the other one missing somewhere in the suitcase.  
</P>
<P>
 Tartan Flannel Shoe Bags (No. 1360-5G18) are $7 a pair from Land's End; tel. 
(800) 356-4444 .  
</P>
<P>
 Finally, a really nifty way of storing and displaying snapshots. The Showbox 
Photo Viewer, created by Burns of Boston, a well-known manufacturer of quality 
picture frames, looks like a thick plastic frame and stores up to 40 
photographs in a slide-out drawer. By opening and closing the drawer (which 
slides into the frame part), the photos rotate in sequence, a new photo 
appearing in the window after each open-and-close motion. The Showbox comes in 
a hard cardboard sleeve with an inner pocket for storing extra photos and/or 
negatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Caution: You must store a minimum of 20 photos for the rotation to work, and 
prints should be in good condition, with no frayed edges, or they could snag.  
</P>
<P>
 Showbox Photo Viewer is $14.99 at department stores and camera shops . For a 
location in your area, call the manufacturer; tel. (800) 998-8090.  
</P>
<P>
 Gear & Gadgets appears the first week of every month.

PLANNING A VACATION FROM VACATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EILEEN OGINTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Palm Springs hotel was beautiful, the weather perfect. We couldn't have 
picked a nicer spot to celebrate our anniversary. There was only one problem -- 
the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 As we drove up, they were busy hurling insults and peanuts at each other in 
the back seat. Of course we hadn't planned a romantic interlude with the kids 
in tow (though I had splurged on a second room). We were simply trying to 
squeeze some family time onto the end of a work trip. 
</P>
<P>
 Wistfully, I thought about how nice a romantic anniversary dinner would be. 
Then I got hit on the back of the head with a peanut. It had been a long day of 
driving for everyone. I was desperate for a break -- my husband more so. I felt 
guilty for wanting one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents shouldn't feel guilty. The kids want to get away from you too," said 
Dr. Jeff Fireman, a suburban Los Angeles pediatrician and the father of two. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwestern University psychologist and marital counselor Karen Abram, Ph.D., 
adds that it's important for kids to see that their parents' lives are more 
than just being mom and dad. 
</P>
<P>
 Abram cites research showing that children's happiness is directly impacted by 
how well their parents get along. 
</P>
<P>
 Some families I know bring a baby-sitter along on vacation. (A teen-age cousin 
may be only too glad to oblige.)  
</P>
<P>
 But there are other, cheaper alternatives. Tricia Gallagher's family vacations 
with relatives on the New Jersey shore not far from her suburban Philadelphia 
home. Gallagher, the mother of four and author of "Raising Happy Kids on a 
Reasonable Budget" (Better Way Books, $10.95), said, "That way there's always 
somebody around to watch the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Make sure to budget for your time alone. Remember that it likely will cost 
more to get child-care away from home. "Think of it as part of being on 
vacation -- like room service," Fireman suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't necessarily mean a luxury resort with morning-until-night kids' 
activities. Many destinations that are a lot easier on the wallet -- family 
camps, for example -- frequently offer some activities for children -- enough 
so that you and your spouse can sneak in a couple of hours alone together, 
noted Sutherland, co-author of "The Best Bargain Family Vacations in the 
U.S.A." (St. Martin's Press, $13.95). Ask about what is available when you make 
your reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 Take a morning walk together if that's when the kids are busy, Sutherland 
suggested. Make a date for lunch instead of dinner. The point is to do 
something together -- not just bury your face in a book on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 As for our anniversary, it couldn't have been nicer. Really. 
</P>
<P>
 When we arrived at the Hyatt Grand Champions outside of Palm Springs, we 
discovered that Camp Hyatt, the hotel chain's activities program for kids, was 
in full swing. The kids were as happy at the prospect of video games, crafts 
and movies, as we were of a relaxing meal (especially when we promised them a 
late-night swim afterward). 
</P>
<P>
 The solitude didn't come cheap: $12 an hour for the three of them, plus $5 
each for their dinners. But the thought of being beaned with a peanut at dinner 
put that out of my mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the Kids appears the first and third week of every month.

BAR HUNTING IN ALASKA; FROM FISHING VILLAGE TO MINING CAMP TO METROPOLIS, LOCAL 
WATERING HOLES CAPTURE STATE'S 'WORK HARD, PLAY HARD' TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN GOTTBERG ANDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER; Anderson is news and graphics 
editor for The Times Travel section and author of Frommer's Alaska '94-'95. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He was big and bold and bearded, and he smelled like effluent from a fish 
cannery. 
</P>
<P>
 He wore high rubber boots over patched overalls, and a plaid flannel shirt 
that stretched tight across his barrel chest. Bloodshot eyes glared out from 
beneath his cap -- a navy-blue tuque -- that covered his long, brown hair. He 
sauntered into the saloon, ordered a brew, pulled up a barrel beside me and 
launched into a vociferous soliloquy on environmental politics. 
</P>
<P>
 He was, in short, an Alaskan. And like many Alaskans, whose reputation for 
toughness in an often-harsh climate is well-deserved, the local bar was his 
social center. 
</P>
<P>
 My new acquaintance on this occasion was a fisherman just in from a cold, 
rainy week of halibut fishing on Kachemak Bay and the Cook Inlet. His refuge 
was the Salty Dawg, which occupies a ramshackle lighthouse opposite a 
bald-eagle feeding ground near the end of the three-mile-long Homer Spit, at 
the tip of the Kenai Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1897, the Salty Dawg has weathered nearly a century of catastrophic 
storms, tidal waves and earthquakes, some of them much larger than Los Angeles' 
recent 6.6-magnitude tremor (a devastating 1964 quake measured 8.4). It has 
been a school, a post office, a grocery store, a railroad station, a 
coal-mining office and an oil-company headquarters. Today the Dawg is a 
sometimes-rowdy saloon with a sawdust floor, initials carved into its counters 
and tables, and flags, life buoys and T-shirts hanging from its ceilings and 
walls. When it's too stormy out to launch a boat, some fishermen and workers 
from nearby canneries are here when the door opens at 11 a.m. -- and stay until 
it closes 18 hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salty Dawg is not unique in its ambience. There are similar watering holes 
throughout the 49th state -- not just in old lighthouses, perhaps, but in 
equally atmospheric settings. Skagway's Red Onion, for instance, is lodged in 
what was once a brothel. And the Howling Dog, 11 miles north of Fairbanks near 
the Arctic Circle, is right on the edge of the tundra. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of a fisherman, your company there might be a North Slope oil worker 
escaping the permafrost, a logger who has been thinning the old-growth cedar 
forests of the Panhandle, or a hard-bitten miner with a lode on his mind. For 
that matter, especially in Anchorage, Alaska's Fresno-size metropolis, it could 
be a spiffed-up office worker out for a night on the town. 
</P>
<P>
 Alaska's natural beauty has few parallels on this earth. The same can be said 
of its half-million people. They work hard to earn a living from an unforgiving 
land, and when the work is over, they traditionally play hard. There may be no 
better place to strike up a conversation than in their local saloons. 
</P>
<P>
 Beer drinkers rave about Alaskan Beer, brewed in Juneau (and best enjoyed at 
that city's Red Dog Saloon). The Alaskan Brewing Co. was established only in 
1986, but already its Alaskan Amber has twice been voted the most popular beer 
at the annual Great American Beer Festival in Colorado. There's also an Alaskan 
Pale Ale ("a northern light"). 
</P>
<P>
 Saloon food varies widely, though it's always pretty basic. You won't find 
oyster bars here. Some bars serve up nothing more appetizing than peanuts and 
pretzels (or, in the case of Anchorage's Fly by Night Club, Spam); others, like 
the Malemute Saloon near Fairbanks, go whole hog with reindeer stew or other 
wild-game dishes. The Red Dog is adjoined by an atmospheric restaurant, The 
Cook House; no meals are served in the bar, but steaks and seafood are 10 steps 
away. More typically, Alaskan bar menus feature burgers or burritos, pizza or 
deli-style sandwiches. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberal state licensing laws permit bars, restaurants, liquor stores and other 
licensed establishments to operate from 8 a.m. to 5 a.m., seven days a week. 
Anchorage, Juneau and many other towns have passed local ordinances that have 
reduced open hours, typically to 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During the past 10 years, while researching and revising a guidebook to the 
state, I have made many visits to Alaska hotels, restaurants, tourist 
attractions and, yes, drinking establishments. Here, then, are some of my 
favorite places, chosen for their uniquely Alaskan spirit. These are all full 
bars, serving a full range of spirits along with beer and wine. With one 
exception, they are local hangouts, but places where tourists are welcomed as 
well. The exception is the Malemute Saloon, which I've included because it so 
successfully re-creates a turn-of-the-century gold-rush flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bird House Bar, Indian. A victim of the massive 1964 earthquake, this 
collapsing log shanty, half-buried in sod 27 miles southeast of downtown 
Anchorage near the hamlet of Indian, has nevertheless managed to stay in 
business. A giant wooden bird's head, painted blue, faces the highway; it is 
half as high as the wall from which it protrudes. The interior is, in a word, 
bizarre. Everything slants in different directions: floors, walls, bar, you 
name it. Conventional wisdom is that you've had too much to drink when things 
begin to look normal! The walls are covered with business cards, photos and 
expired driver's licenses, and the bartender may insist that you cannot go 
until you leave something of yours behind. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chilkoot Charlie's, Anchorage. Chilkoot Charlie is a sort of Alaskan Paul 
Bunyan. This mythic character once, for instance, staved off starvation on an 
ice floe by eating the tail of a polar bear and giving the bear the bone to 
chew on. According to legend, that's why the modern polar bear has only a stump 
for a tail. His name is now carried by Anchorage's most stereotypically 
"Alaskan" bar -- with sawdust floors, padded tree-stump stools and 
gold-rush-era decor. At opposite ends of "Koot's," as the club is known, are 
two stages for live music: One serves up high-decibel rock for dancing nightly; 
the other features mainly country and Alaskan "bush ballad" singers. Between 
them are three bars, a snack counter that serves burritos and pizzas, and an 
enclosed courtyard with horseshoe and barbecue pits. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fly by Night Club, Anchorage. The whimsical owner of this enigmatic 
nightspot, a jazz musician who calls himself Mr. White Keys, keeps his tongue 
planted firmly in cheek. The nightly entertainment schedule at his club 
features slapstick revues like "The Whale Fat Follies," performances by top 
local rock and jazz bands, and various special events, from '50s parties to 
lingerie shows. The menu is limited to Spam hors d'oeuvres -- half-price with 
champagne by the glass, free with Dom Perignon. White Keys' own jazz band is 
called the Spamtones, and the club's phone number is 279-SPAM. The Fly by Night 
closes after Christmas until April. Cover charge for the "follies" is $10; 
otherwise, entry is free except when major touring acts appear.  
</P>
<P>
 * Howling Dog Saloon, Fox. Fairbanks' most popular bar isn't even in Fairbanks 
-- it's 11 miles north on the edge of the tundra, en route to the Arctic 
Circle. As the northernmost bar in this listing (most Alaskan native 
communities, which predominate in northern Alaska, have banned the sale of 
alcohol), it's the best place to enjoy the midnight sun of midsummer, far from 
the city lights. Throughout June and July, the volleyball court in the Howling 
Dog's back yard is in use all night long. This rustic establishment is packed 
to the rafters most nights, and especially Thursday through Saturday, when a 
neighborhood band plays home-grown rock 'n' roll. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kito's Kave, Petersburg. A noisy anomaly in an otherwise quiet Scandinavian 
enclave on the Inside Passage, Kito's is lodged in a nondescript red building 
at a decidedly un-Norwegian intersection named for a Chinese (Sing Lee Alley) 
and a native Tlingit (Chief John Lott Street). Hard by the small-boat harbor, 
it draws fishermen who enjoy live rock music . . . and fishermen's wives, 
especially when the Chippendale male dancers are in town. 
</P>
<P>
 * Malemute Saloon, Ester. Made famous by the Robert Service ballad, "The 
Shooting of Dan McGrew," the Malemute looks like a converted barn with classic 
swinging doors and a sawdust floor. Tables are mere boards on kegs; a sign at 
the bar urges patrons to "Please use spittoon." Reindeer stew and other dishes 
are served dinner-show guests who pay $14.95 to see re-enactments of Service's 
narrative poems on stage to the tune of ragtime music. (The show is $5 without 
dinner.) Open summers only, the Malemute is located at the Ester Gold Camp, a 
restored 1890s miners' settlement at the end of a dirt road, eight miles west 
of Fairbanks.  
</P>
<P>
 * Red Dog Saloon, Juneau. Among the old firearms behind the bar is a gun that 
Wyatt Earp supposedly deposited on his way to the gold fields in the 1890s . . 
. and never reclaimed. Overhead, amid other marine memorabilia autographed by 
ships' crews, is a flag from the infamous Exxon Valdez; management swears it's 
the banner the ill-fated tanker was flying when it ran aground in Prince 
William Sound in 1989. Indeed, the decor of the venerable Red Dog -- one of the 
first places cruise-ship passengers see when they alight in the state capital 
-- reflects a century of Alaskan whimsy and history. Though it has changed 
location several times, this friendly saloon still boasts decor straight out of 
a taxidermist's shop. But the argonauts of yesteryear didn't have a bustling 
souvenir shop or the adjoining Cook House restaurant, which re-creates a 
turn-of-the-century mining camp atmosphere. (The menu offers what may be the 
state's biggest hamburger: two pounds, served on a pizza-size bun with two 
pounds of French fries on the side for $13.95.)  
</P>
<P>
 * Red Onion Saloon, Skagway. Many moons have passed since this former brothel 
served its customers more than drinks, but cutouts of scantily clad young women 
still peer through the red-lit upstairs windows, overlooking what was once the 
main route to the Klondike Gold Rush; monogrammed garters are the best-selling 
souvenir. The Red Onion has live jazz frequently, honky-tonk piano and jukebox 
always, and dancing wherever patrons find floor space. It serves huge 
deli-style sandwiches at lunch, too. Like many other establishments in 
tourism-oriented Skagway, the Red Onion closes for the winter. GUIDEBOOK

DENALI DAYS; IN A PRISTINE NATIONAL PARK, WOMEN'S GROUP EXPERIENCES 
COMPANIONSHIP, STATE OF WONDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GAIL FISHER, Fisher is photo editor/projects for The Times Orange County 
edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 We emerge from our tents seeking the day's first cup of coffee. It is 7 a.m., 
but here in the tundra below Mt. McKinley this July morning, there is already 
midday light. Also in search of breakfast is a reddish brown fox that has 
boldly walked into camp. The plentiful Arctic ground squirrels will be easy 
prey for him as they scurry about, oblivious to the campers. 
</P>
<P>
 We are in Savage River Campground, in the eastern section of Denali National 
Park. This Massachusetts-sized preserve, surrounding the highest peak in North 
America, is about 250 miles north of Anchorage. Because of government 
protections limiting development and traffic, Denali survives as one of the 
most pristine of America's national parks.  
</P>
<P>
 The 13 members of our all-woman group -- lawyers, doctors, businesswomen and 
other professionals from New York to California -- share a sense of adventure 
and an appreciation for the wilderness. Our leader is Carole Latimer, founder 
of the Berkeley-based Call of the Wild, a woman's outdoor adventure school. 
Latimer has been guiding women on wilderness experiences for the past 15 years, 
and many of us know each other from previous trips. 
</P>
<P>
 The dynamics of female camaraderie are part of what has brought us here today. 
Women in this particular group are on the fast track, juggling career and 
family. For a lot of us, this trip is a chance to slow down.  
</P>
<P>
 We are camping Denali-style, clearing our campground each day as park rules 
demand, to discourage visits from marauding animals, especially bears. We put 
all our food, food containers, cooking utensils and coolers in our van.  
</P>
<P>
 Soon we join the ranks of the bus-riding tourists, packing ourselves into one 
of the many shuttles that provide the major access into the park. Our driver 
introduces himself as John Moore: "My job is to watch the road. Your job is to 
watch for wildlife. Just yell, 'Stop!' " 
</P>
<P>
 For the first 15 miles, the road is paved and open to private vehicles, with 
roadside services and campgrounds, including the one where our group is 
staying. The rest of the 97-mile road -- most of it narrow, dusty and unpaved 
-- begins at Savage River Canyon, where visitors must board U.S. Park Service 
shuttles or private tour buses, or begin their hike. 
</P>
<P>
 Equipped with my camera equipment, including a 600-millimeter lens for 
photographing wildlife, I make my way to the back of the bus, where I can leap 
from one side to the other as we journey through the beautiful green taiga (a 
Russian term for "land of little sticks," referring to the scant, undersized 
trees).  
</P>
<P>
 It is unseasonably hot, in the 80s, and we're told by our bus driver that 
animal sightings probably will be down today. Summer temperatures average in 
the low- to mid-60s, and in this heat the animals will be hunkered down 
somewhere in the shaded brush. But it's a clear, sunny day and mighty McKinley 
-- 20,320 feet of sharply angled snow, ice and rock -- comes into view. We are 
fortunate. The mountain is visible 20%-25% of the time. It's spectacular!  
</P>
<P>
 Today's trip promises a hot, dusty ride on a school bus with nearly 50 other 
people for the next 12 hours. But this is the only way many of the 500,000 who 
visit Denali annually see the park, some of them taking an inland break from 
their Alaskan cruise packages. Though the buses seem unglamorous and 
restrictive, they minimize human intrusion into the park. Even so, they run at 
full capacity, and reservations are required.  
</P>
<P>
 Denali is one of the few national parks where wildlife remains truly wild. The 
handful of hikers traveling the back country here can experience a nearly pure 
environment. But even overnight backpackers don't have easy access. They must 
wait, sometimes for days, for a permit issued only one day in advance.  
</P>
<P>
 Near Polychrome Summit, our bus slows and driver John points out a marmot 
sunning itself on Marmot Hill. Another one appears. It's getting more 
interesting through a camera lens, but John drives on. 
</P>
<P>
 We stop for lunch at Eielson Visitor Center, named after Alaska's first 
pioneer bush pilot, Carl Ben Eielson. As we eat our bagels, tomatoes and 
cheese, the view of Mt. McKinley -- with its sheer white and gray walls against 
the pristine blue sky -- is awe-inspiring. The Athabascan native people gave 
the massive peak the name Denali, meaning "the High One." Today, many people in 
Alaska refer to McKinley by its Athabascan name. It is the crown of the 
600-mile-long Alaska Range. 
</P>
<P>
 After lunch, it is five more hours to the end of the road. Our bus finally 
makes it to Wonder Lake, a four-mile-long, 280-foot-deep hole in the tundra. 
But there's no time to explore its shores, and we are herded back onto the bus 
for the six-hour ride back to Savage River Campground.  
</P>
<P>
 It is beginning to cool off as we make our way around Polychrome Mountain. Our 
wildlife sightings soon increase. We spot a caribou off in the distance. 
Another bus passes and our driver gives the caribou hand signal: thumb to the 
forehead and four fingers extended upward. We're on a roll now. As we make our 
way through Sable Pass, we spot a mother grizzly and her two cubs digging 
through the boykinia, or bear flower. This area is called the Sable Pass 
Critical Habitat Wildlife Closure. It is prime grizzly habitat and, except for 
the road, is closed to humans. On our way again, we reach Igloo Creek, where a 
cow moose is kicking up her heels as she skids across a patch of snow on the 
tundra.  
</P>
<P>
 We make our way off the bus at 10 p.m. The sun is still high in the sky. While 
part of our group begins to cook dinner, a friend and I head off to a 
campground store in search of some Alaskan Pale Ale, badly needed after the 
heat and dust of the day's ride.  
</P>
<P>
 Tonight we'll have Mexican tabouli , black bean soup and tequila shooters with 
fresh lime. Call of the Wild is known for its delicious meals. Other nights 
there will be Thai tom yum and Szechuan snow peas, linguine and pesto, sherried 
mushroom bisque -- even flaming cherries jubilee one night for dessert.  
</P>
<P>
 On our second day in Denali, we will hike to Primrose Ridge, elevation 4,300 
feet. We begin our 2,500-foot ascent at Savage River bridge. From below, the 
tundra looks soft and velvety. In reality, the ground is mostly lumpy 
permafrost, softened with mosses and lichen. 
</P>
<P>
 This is bear country, so some of the women have tied bells to their shoes and 
packs to scare away any that might be residing in the thick underbrush. Finally 
at the ridge, the bells come off and we can hear the wind blow. Everywhere I 
turn, the scenery looks like a painted backdrop, almost too beautiful to be 
real.  
</P>
<P>
 Our lunch of crackers, cheese, celery, peanut butter and dried bananas 
fortifies us for the more challenging terrain ahead. We continue traversing the 
ridge and arrive at a steep face of scree -- loose, silty rock. On all fours we 
begin our climb. Some of the group members have turned back. I'm questioning my 
sanity, having loaded down my pack with 35 pounds of mostly camera gear.  
</P>
<P>
 Five of us finally reach the top. With its covering of soft, mossy grass, the 
wide clearing looks like a park playground. Walking along the ridge we spot a 
handful of rams on the outcropping of the ridge. They make ridge climbing look 
so simple as they amble up an incline and leap up a rocky patch of scree.  
</P>
<P>
 A few of us are back for more of the shuttle bus today. It's cooler and our 
plan is to hike down the ridge at the Eielson Visitor Center and crisscross the 
river, then return to the center to catch the last bus back to our camp at 
Savage River. As we make our way down the steep, perfumed path, the purple and 
yellow hues of the wildflowers carpet the landscape. We bushwhack our way 
through thick growth until we reach the river. I wade in with the rest of the 
group, but leave the crossings to others when the water level reaches our 
waists. 
</P>
<P>
 The sky is changing rapidly. I can smell rain in the air. Clouds above us are 
moving rapidly and changing from white to gray to black before my eyes. The 
morning gave us a blue, cloudless sky, but by late afternoon Denali is 
swallowed up by cloud cover. The distant roar of thunder, followed by crackling 
bolts of lightning, echo through the canyon. We climb up the ridge back to the 
visitor center as the sky roils, and we discover our bus is ready to depart. By 
the time we've reached Highway Pass, the rain is coming down in torrents, 
bringing some falling rock down on the slippery, narrow mountain road. As our 
bus fishtails near the edge of a steep incline, the passengers around me are 
getting nervous and the tension is rising. One more pass to make it through and 
we're home free. 
</P>
<P>
 As we begin our climb through Polychrome Pass, the light becomes heavenly. A 
rainbow appears as the storm's fury lessens. Rays of light play on Polychrome 
Mountain while black clouds hover. I try to persuade the driver to stop. When 
he finds out it's only because I'm trying to photograph the light and a 
rainbow, he's on his way at top speed.  
</P>
<P>
 We arrive back at Savage River and decide not to cook in the rain: It's going 
to be pizza night out at Lynx Creek Pizza, 17 miles away, just outside the 
park. Civilization has its rewards, too. GUIDEBOOK

AH, TO BE YOUNG AND IN PARIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCY IZON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Student-style travelers visiting France this year can find lodging and tourist 
information from several helpful sources. 
</P>
<P>
 If you drop into the tourist information office at 127 avenue des 
Champs-Elysees, a short walk south of the Arc de Triomphe, you can pick up a 
free copy of "Youth in Paris." It's a 31-page booklet detailing what to see in 
the city and how to do it, and includes a subway map plus emergency telephone 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Another source for assistance is the Accueil des Jeunes (AJF), an 
accommodation booking service that can reserve beds in Paris or other areas of 
France, in youth centers and budget hotels, for a fee of $1.60. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the AJF is geared to travelers under 26, there is no age limit for 
using its accommodation booking service. 
</P>
<P>
 The AJF has 8,000 beds available in Paris in the winter and 11,000 in the 
summer. The AJF also operates its own hostel near the Bastille, as well as 
three restored townhouses. 
</P>
<P>
 Rates for beds in Paris start at $16 a night and rise depending on the 
facility and how many people share a room. 
</P>
<P>
 AJF offices are at 16 rue du Pont Louis-Philippe, tel. (from the U.S.) 
011-33-1-42-78-04-82; 119 rue St. Martin, tel. 011-33-1-42-77-87-80; 139 
boulevard St.-Michel, tel. 011- 33-1-43-54-95-86 (open March to October), and 
Gare du Nord rail station, tel. 011-33-1-42-85-86-19 (open June to October). 
</P>
<P>
 One of the centers into which the AJF can book guests is FIAP Jean Monet, a 
550-bed, 25-year-old youth hotel that was renovated two years ago. Individuals 
are charged $40 for a single room, $26 per person in a double room, about $25 
in a four-bed room and $20 in an eight-bed room. 
</P>
<P>
 The popular student travel guide "Let's Go: Europe" (St. Martin's Press), 
which lists more than 50 budget accommodation facilities in Paris, says FIAP 
Jean Monet rooms are "well-furnished," "all with toilet and shower . . . 
impeccably maintained." It also warns that it's full in summer with tour 
groups, has a three-night maximum stay and reservations are essential. 
</P>
<P>
 FIAP Jean Monet is at 30 rue Canabis, tel. 011-33-1-45-89-89-15 or fax 
011-33-145-81-63-91. 
</P>
<P>
 The AJF offices in Paris can also help you prearrange accommodations in other 
areas of France. This year, for example, much attention will focus on the 
Normandy area for D-Day anniversary events. The AJF can book accommodations 
into a youth center in that area, in the city of Caen. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 6, 50 years after the landings by the Allied nations, seven heads of 
state and 30,000 veterans, dignitaries and representatives will gather at the 
Caen Memorial to commemorate the 50th anniversary of D-Day. 
</P>
<P>
 The special events are not limited to that date, however. Activities are 
scheduled from April until October. For example, on May 14-15, 1940 vintage 
cars will rally on the invasion beaches; approximately 200 of the vehicles are 
expected to parade through the town center, gathering at the Caen Memorial.  
</P>
<P>
 According to a recent French government survey, travelers between the ages of 
15 and 25 represented 10% of the visitors to France. To help service this 
segment of the market, 54 private and nonprofit businesses banded together to 
form an organization called Le Club Francais du Tourisme de Jeunes. CFTJ 
members, which include accommodation services, holiday centers, language study 
programs, holiday activity programs, theme parks and museums, publish a 
brochure called "France, Youth, Travel" that describes their services. A new 
edition is scheduled for publication later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, contact the French Government Tourist Office, 9454 
Wilshire Blvd., Suite 715, Beverly Hills 90212-2967; tel. (900) 990-0040 (calls 
cost 50 per minute).

RAIN FOREST REVERIE; GETTING AWAY FROM IT ALL AT A REMOTE WILDERNESS CABIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOEL SCHWARTZ, Schwartz is a Santa Monica-based free-lance writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The skies are angry with threatening rain clouds, but the locals say that's 
typical for Ketchikan. Although this fishing village on Revillagigedo Island in 
southeastern Alaska can get 200 inches of rain a year, no one around here seems 
to complain about the weather. But Jim and I aren't as concerned about the 
possibility of showers this morning as we are about the lowness of the clouds. 
In about an hour, some wild-eyed bush pilot whom we've never met is supposed to 
fly us over the storm brewing east of Ketchikan to a remote cabin we've never 
seen in the midst of a wilderness called Misty Fiords. The problem isn't that 
we don't know what to expect -- which we don't; we're just concerned the 
visibility will be too poor for us to land. 
</P>
<P>
 We didn't come to Alaska just to see some wilderness from the deck of a cruise 
ship or the shade of an RV, which is how most visitors experience the state; 
and we didn't want to have to backpack for days to get away from civilization. 
So when we heard the U.S. Forest Service maintains nearly 200 public-use cabins 
in remote parts of Alaska's Tongass and Chugach national forests, I thought we 
might have found exactly what we were looking for. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems the cabins come furnished with wood-burning stoves, some firewood and 
an ax, and an outhouse. Many are located on lakes or streams with a rowboat 
included, and all can be rented for up to 14 days at $20 a night, which barely 
covers the Forest Service's fly-in maintenance costs. Within a week of sending 
our reservation to Misty Fiords, an official permit arrived in the mail, 
complete with hand-drawn map showing our cabin on Manzanita Lake. Also included 
was a list of what the USFS would provide and what we would need to fly in. It 
sounded like the real wilderness and became the ultimate destination of our 
trip. 
</P>
<P>
 We gave ourselves a week last June for the drive from Santa Monica to 
Boundary, Alaska, on the border of the Yukon. After days of driving through the 
expansive Canadian Northwest, we were totally psyched for a larger-than-life 
land where fist-sized gold nuggets wash down the creeks in spring; where frozen 
is the natural state for much of the terrain, and nothing but microscopic ice 
worms consider glaciers a living habitat.  
</P>
<P>
 By the time we had crossed the interior and reached the Pacific Coast at the 
Gold Rush town of Skagway, we were ready to trade in the road for the state 
ferry system, which connects the coastal islands and towns. We had reservations 
on a ship called the Matanuska, and wound up spending two relaxing days 
floating at an unhurried pace past rugged fiords through the endless islands of 
the Inland Passage. Now that we've finally arrived here in Ketchikan, we only 
need to locate our bush pilot to reach our wilderness goal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of shirtless guys direct us to an unpretentious shed down on the 
dock. There we meet our bush pilot, Dave, who turns out to be a surprisingly 
normal looking, no scruffy-bearded crazy. Having just called to check the local 
weather conditions, Dave isn't too sure himself if we're going to be able to 
land at Manzanita Lake. But he feels confident we'll at least be able to take 
off safely, as long as we leave during the next half hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Misty Fiords National Monument begins two-thirds of the way across 
Revillagigedo Island and continues eastward across a wild expanse of glacially 
carved coastal mountains on the Alaska mainland. And suddenly there it is -- 
Manzanita Lake, a pristine crescent-shaped body of water in the midst of a rain 
forest with cascades splashing down granite cliffs. I spot the rowboat pulled 
up on the rocks before I actually make out the cabin itself, nearly hidden by 
the abundant overgrowth in spite of being set back only 20 yards from the lake. 
As the plane taxis up to the shore, Dave quickly helps us unload our gear. The 
skies rumble and the drizzle starts. Moments later we find ourselves with our 
possessions getting rained on as we watch the retreating Cessna beat the 
incoming storm, disappearing over the treetops and leaving us alone in the 
middle of nowhere. Undaunted, we barely get our gear inside before the heavens 
finally let loose with a vengeance, as if they had only been waiting for us to 
reach our goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The cabin is cold and damp but somehow looks as if it has the potential to be 
cozy. Through each of the cabin's windows you can see the incredible vegetation 
all around: centuries-old Sitka spruce towering overhead, giant ferns, devil's 
broom with overgrown leaves, all contributing an utterly primeval feel to the 
forest.  
</P>
<P>
 It never stops raining. Occasionally we get a dry spell of 10 or 15 minutes, 
which gives us a little time to reduce a slab of tree trunk to a sizable 
woodpile. But most of the time the weather ranges from heavy drizzle to total 
downpour: hence the term "rain forest." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the chance to be so completely away from it all is everything I want. 
Whether we're outside in the rain watching ripples on the lake or holing up 
inside the cabin cooking food, there is a visceral feeling of utter remoteness 
knowing that we're the only humans within miles. There is the satisfaction of 
reverting to a back-to-basics life, if only for a few days. The very act of 
walking up to the outhouse, with its rock-and-tree-root path overgrown with 
lilies-of-the-valley and tiny floral sprays, is a walk through a world of 
fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not the only one who's had this response. The guest logbook holds pages of 
enraptured journalism by former tenants of the cabin. The fishing people mostly 
note what types of salmon are biting where and when (the most prolific seem to 
be kokanee in July) but other items include a saga about the nightly visitation 
of mice (we never saw them) and the arrival of some lusty Sasquatch in search 
of women (I think we heard them).  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ordinarily I would have taken most of these entries for tall tales, what 
Alaskans call bull-chitna . But this land has a reputation for the 
unpredictable and the capacity for doing weird things to your head. In fact, on 
our final night in the cabin -- and mind you, this is already pretty late in 
June -- overnight the temperature abruptly nose-dived and dropped below 
freezing, and an unexpected blizzard came up across the lake.  
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, we had enough cut wood so the stove kept the cold outside of the 
cabin. But the strangest thing happened around 4 a.m., when the temperature 
dropped to its lowest. Ice worms started crawling out of the frozen surface of 
the lake -- I guess unable to handle the extreme cold -- and began chirping, of 
all things. Neither of us would have seen them but they were chirping so loud 
they woke us up. The only thing missing was the Northern Lights, but aside from 
that we finally got a dose of the Alaskan wilderness. GUIDEBOOK

 Since its founding in 1974, a little-known nonprofit adult education program 
in Southern California called STEP Tours (Steps to Explore Potential) has grown 
into a full-fledged organization with emphasis on day trips to museums, 
botanical gardens, theme parks and other destinations of interest to seniors. 
Activities also include excursions to stage plays, musicals, concerts and TV 
tapings. On some trips, lunch or dinner is part of the package. STEP also has 
one- and two-day bus trips to places such as Laughlin, Nev., Death Valley and 
Palm Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, STEP has expanded its programs to include more distant destinations, 
and is now offering a fully escorted spring trip to Cajun country and the 
Ozarks. This trip is distinct in that seniors have the option of booking both 
packages as a single 15-day tour, or selecting either one as an eight-day trip. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cajun country portion includes Little Rock, Ark., New Orleans and five 
other Southern cities. The Ozarks portion includes Little Rock; Branson, Mo.; 
Kansas City, and four other cities. Both itineraries include visits to museums, 
famous landmarks, antebellum homes, historic mansions, libraries, gardens and 
plantations. 
</P>
<P>
 The per-person cost for the combined tours is $1,550; dates are April 17 to 
May 1. The per-person cost for Cajun country is $720 for eight days, April 
17-24. For the Ozarks, $830 for eight days, April 24 to May 1. Prices are for 
the land portion only, and do not include air fare. For a brochure with the 
complete itineraries and prices, call STEP Tours at (310) 377-1601. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Touring the Netherlands by bicycle is popular with senior travelers because 
the country is small and flat. Holland Bicycling Tours, based in Thousand Oaks, 
conducts tours within the Netherlands and adjacent countries. Prices quoted 
below are per person, based on double occupancy, and are for land only (no air 
fare). Included are breakfast and dinner daily, airport transfers, entrance 
fees for places of interest, hotel tips and taxes, and two professional tour 
leaders. A support van accompanies each tour. Lightweight bicycles with upright 
handlebars are provided at no extra charge for those who elect not to bring 
their own bikes. 
</P>
<P>
 A choice of tour dates is available in June, July and August; prices range 
from $1,125 for seven-night, eight-day tours to $1,625 for 11-night, 12-day 
tours. In addition to three tours within the Netherlands, there are three other 
11-day, 12-night tours: a "European Tour" that includes Belgium and northern 
Germany ($1,625); France's Loire Valley in September ($1,675), and 
Switzerland's lakes in early August ($1,775). The latter includes travel by 
train or postal bus at higher elevations. For more information, contact Holland 
Bicycling Tours, P.O. Box 6485, Thousand Oaks 91359; tel. (800) 852-3258 or fax

GOING WHERE FEW ROADS GO; SHIPS EXPLORE CORNERS OF THE 49THSTATE THAT CAN'T BE 
REACHED BY CAR

 If you spread out a map of Alaska and study the veined lines that denote 
highways, you'll see how little of that vast state can be reached by road. 
</P>
<P>
 But traveling by sea opens up much more of the state. Over the years, we've 
stepped off cruise ships and into the hearts of communities from Dutch Harbor 
in the Aleutians to Barrow, far above the Arctic Circle, and from the Inside 
Passage's southeasternmost port of Ketchikan to Little Diomede Island in the 
middle of the Bering Strait. 
</P>
<P>
 Two midsummer cruises aboard Clipper Adventure Cruises' 140-passenger World 
Discoverer (July 8 and Aug. 9) will take you to the wind-swept cliffs of the 
Pribilof Islands in the Bering Sea, where cartoon-faced horned and tufted 
puffins stare comically down from their ledge perches and thousands of fur 
seals tumble in the icy water among the rocks and kelp. There are Arctic foxes, 
not white in summer but coal black, looking like small furry dogs, and bald 
eagles soaring lazily above the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 The ship also visits Katmai National Park, where Katmai brown bear can be 
glimpsed fishing for spawning salmon, and Dutch Harbor on Unalaska Island in 
the Aleutians, nearer Japan and Russia than Washington and Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost everyone in Dutch Harbor works for one of the Japanese-owned 
fish-packing plants and lives in community housing. Each employee shares a 
12-by-12-foot room and bath with one roommate and is fed in a central dining 
hall at 6 a.m., noon, 6 p.m. and midnight, since work goes on around the clock 
during the short but busy season. 
</P>
<P>
 The 188-passenger Hanseatic, a recently built state-of-the-art expedition 
vessel marketed in the United States by Seven Seas Cruises, will set out Aug. 
18 from Greenland for an east-to-west transit of the rarely visited Northwest 
Passage. Should the transit be successful in getting through the ice, it will 
visit Barrow, Pt. Hope, Little Diomede, Nome, Dutch Harbor and Homer before 
arriving in Anchorage Sept. 14. If not, it will turn around and visit other 
ports of call.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the last great seagoing adventures, the Northwest Passage transit by 
passenger ship has been successful only six times prior to this attempt, the 
first in 1984 from east to west. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, on the first west-to-east transit, we sailed aboard the World 
Discoverer through a world of fire and ice in the Beaufort Sea, surrounded by a 
surrealist fantasy of towering frozen cliffs on one side and the glittering 
sand-colored skyscrapers of an Arctic Manhattan, twinkling with lights and 
belching flames, on the other. A mirage effect called "looming" made the frozen 
cliffs reflect against themselves in the sunlight, and the "city" of the oil 
platforms and administration buildings at Prudhoe Bay reflect upside-down and 
right-side-up in several layers as if suspended in gray aspic between sea and 
sky. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, we visited sparsely settled villages in the Alaskan and 
Canadian Arctic, and went ashore at Beechey Island to see graves from the 
tragic 19th-Century Franklin Expedition. Zodiac landing craft took us close to 
icebergs off Greenland and unexplored inlets along Baffin Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 But while a few of Alaska's seagoing visitors this summer will be aboard 
expedition ships and more casual vessels that offer alternative shipboard 
lifestyles and explore off-the-beaten-track areas, most will opt for classic, 
mainstream cruise ships with professional entertainment, dress-up evenings and 
spa and exercise programs. 
</P>
<P>
 With 32 vessels cruising Alaska this summer, offering some 25% more beds than 
last summer, the range of choices is wider than ever for passengers considering 
a first, or even second or third, Alaska cruise. Better still, early bookings 
earn discounts or special bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Alaska-bound vacationers can select theme cruises that range ofrom 
country-Western and square dance sailings to photography workshops and big-band 
sounds, or opt for a luxury rail trip in a dome car through pristine Alaskan 
wilderness. 
</P>
<P>
 They can go in search of moose and musk ox in Denali National Park, traveling 
between Anchorage and Fairbanks by train, or climb aboard the historic 
narrow-gauge White Pass & Yukon Railway in Skagway for a trip up to Dead Horse 
Pass and the 1898 gold-rush trail to the Klondike. 
</P>
<P>
 They can hoot and holler in a turn-of-the-century saloon with sawdust on the 
floor and dancing girls by the piano, cheer for the hero and boo the villain in 
a melodrama, or recite "The Shooting of Dan McGrew" with a Robert Service 
look-alike.  
</P>
<P>
 They can book a combination cruise/RV overland vacation, or stay before or 
after the cruise in a private fishing lodge in a national park. 
</P>
<P>
 They can cruise fiords and glaciers by day and sleep overnight in a shore-side 
hotel, or take an inflatable Zodiac landing craft into remote waters to watch 
Alaska brown bears fishing for salmon. 
</P>
<P>
 The average Alaska cruise passenger is getting younger. Bill Pedlar, vice 
president of marketing and sales for Princess Tours, an affiliate of Princess 
Cruises, estimates the average visitor's age at 50, compared to 58 or 59 a 
decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 19 large mainstream vessels scheduled to cruise Alaska this summer, 
three will be shiny 1993-model ships: Holland America Line's 1,266-passenger 
Maasdam, which made its debut in December; Cunard's 800-passenger Crown 
Dynasty, which was christened last July, and Norwegian Cruise Line's 
1,246-passenger Windward, which entered service in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Itineraries are about evenly divided between the classic Inside Passage 
seven-day cruise -- with many vessels sailing into Glacier Bay -- and the Gulf 
of Alaska seven-day cruise, which includes cruising past Columbia Glacier with 
an option to visit Anchorage. A few ships -- Cunard's Sagafjord, Royal 
Caribbean Cruise Line's Sun Viking and Princess Cruises' Fair Princess (which 
sails on 10-day round trips from San Francisco) -- offer sailings of 10 or 11 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 While both itineraries include cruise-by looks at glaciers, passengers should 
bear in mind that the bigger the ship, the further away from the ice it has to 
stay. Many large cruise ships, such as those from Holland America, offer 
alternative small-boat glacier cruises as part of add-on land packages. 
</P>
<P>
 Counted among the alternative vessels, which usually number about a dozen, is 
one large ship, the 540-passenger Universe from World Explorer. A seagoing 
university in winter, the Universe offers a 12,000-volume library, a roster of 
expert lecturers and a 14-day cruise that covers nine ports of call, plus 
Glacier Bay, Columbia Glacier and the Kenai Fjords. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest operator in the small-ship field is Alaska Sightseeing/Cruise West 
with six small ships, including the 90-passenger Sheltered Seas, which cruises 
by day and takes passengers to shore-side hotels overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Adventure Cruises' World Discoverer and its 138-passenger Yorktown 
Clipper both sail the Inside Passage, Gulf of Alaska and British Columbia's 
Queen Charlotte Islands. The ships emphasize the flora and fauna of the region, 
with frequent forays in rubberized Zodiac landing craft. 
</P>
<P>
 Special Expeditions takes its 70-passenger sister ships Sea Lion and Sea Bird, 
equipped with Zodiac landing craft, into hidden areas of Alaska's coastal 
wilderness in search of humpback whales, bald eagles and sea lions. 
</P>
<P>
 One new option for Alaska cruises is a combination cruise and overland 
recreational vehicle vacation with Holland America and Alaska Highway Cruises. 
A number of options are available, all combining a seven-day cruise with a 
seven- or 14-day overland drive. Alaska Highway Cruises has 100 new Class C 
cab-over vehicles sleeping from two to six persons, and will provide reserved 
campground spots, maps and other travel information. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Alaska-bound cruise lines are offering early-booking incentives. For 
example, book 120 days ahead of the sailing date with Cunard's Sagafjord or 
Crown Dynasty and get a 15% discount on the cruise fare. Book five months in 
advance with World Explorer's Universe and earn a three-day Vancouver stay or a 
two-day Seattle stay before or after the cruise.

THE FARRAKHAN PARADOX; A SEARCH FOR MORAL AUTHORITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROGER WILKINS, Roger Wilkins is a professor of history at George Mason 
University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Louis Farrakhan's rebuke on Thursday of his associate, Khalid Abdul Muhammad, 
for a vile and ugly speech delivered at Kean College in New Jersey last 
November was lim ited, bitter and contained what can only be interpreted as an 
endorsement of all of the substance of that speech. Though traditional black 
leaders can't say it publicly, Farrakhan's curious and contorted performance 
did them a big political favor. It loosened an embrace with him that was 
dismaying for some and uncomfortable for others -- but from which they had 
found it difficult to extricate themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 At the annual Congressional Black Caucus weekend, two months before the 
Muhammad speech, caucus Chairman Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.) proclaimed that the 
caucus and the assembled black leaders would enter into a "sacred covenant" to 
work cooperatively with Farrakhan's Nation of Islam. Jesse Jackson and Benjamin 
Chavis, executive director of the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored 
People, were on the podium with Farrakhan and Mfume when the "covenant" was 
announced. Mfume's announcement surprised some on the podium and, judging from 
comments they are now making, dismayed some of his colleagues in the caucus. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering Farrakhan's history, the comment sent shudders of apprehension 
through the Jewish community. As an old friend of mine, a former staff member 
of a main-line Jewish organization said: "Won't this Farrakhan problem ever go 
away? Until it does, there'll always be deep divisions between Jews and 
blacks." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, Farrakhan was barely known outside the black community. Most blacks 
knew him simply as a fiery orator who had become leader of one fragment of the 
religious empire once headed by Elijah Muhammad -- for whom Malcolm X had 
served as chief spokesman. In that election year, Farrakhan threw his political 
support to Jackson's bid for the Democratic presidential nomination. His 
comment that Judaism was a "gutter religion" became intertwined with extensive 
press discussions of Jackson's own insensitive comments about Jews. White 
America was then introduced to the intensity of Farrakhan's rhetoric and its 
deeply anti-Semitic subtexts. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrakhan quickly became the human embodiment of frictions long simmering 
between blacks and Jews. Many Jewish leaders urged first Jackson, then other 
prominent blacks to disavow both Farrakhan and his words. Many blacks were 
reluctant to do that for a variety of reasons, and several took great offense 
at the idea that denunciation of Farrakhan had been made into a litmus test for 
a continuation of good relationships between the groups. 
</P>
<P>
 In the years since 1984, Jackson has made consistent efforts -- including a 
dramatic speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention and a major address 
to the World Jewish Congress a year or so ago -- to repair his relationship 
with the Jewish community. Other prominent members of the Jewish and black 
communities worked hard during the decade to heal the rifts. Then, last year, 
it began to look like even Farrakhan was moving to moderate his anti-Semitic 
image. The most dramatic gesture was a violin concert, where he performed works 
by Felix Mendelssohn, a Jewish composer. 
</P>
<P>
 While Jackson's efforts have been appreciated by some (but by no means all) 
Jews, Farrakhan's image had not improved much, if at all. Thus, the dismay when 
Mfume announced his "covenant," with Farrakhan's Nation of Islam. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was hard for black leaders to make the problem "go away," because it 
has at least three prongs -- all of which grow out of the acute problems that 
blacks continue to experience and many whites continue to deny. 
</P>
<P>
 The first is that our struggle for justice produces a utopian, but 
understandable yearning for unity among our people. The tactic of dividing then 
conquering us has been used effectively by our enemies over the centuries, and 
we hate to do it to ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The second problem is that many of us genuinely do admire some of the good 
works the Nation of Islam does. Its ability to rescue human spirits from the 
ravages of drugs or lives of crime and turn them into clean-living, 
constructive and spiritual human beings is enormously constructive. Moreover, 
the Nation of Islam is engaged in a number of anti-violence campaigns that we 
all encourage and applaud. For example, the Washington branch of the Nation 
cleaned up Paradise Gardens, a local housing project notorious as a haven for 
drug addicts and criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 The final problem is more complex. The most vulnerable people in our community 
are being brutalized by economic forces far beyond our control and by a 
politics shaped by a contempt of their fellow-citizens. America has allowed -- 
with hardly any quibble -- the construction of a deadly machine that destroys 
families and civility; robs children of youth, hope and morality at an early 
age, and kills babies on a daily basis. That machine is an unemployment rate 
that reaches 50% to 60% -- even 65% in some neighborhoods, according to 
sociologist William Julius Wilson. The overall black unemployment rate has 
dipped below 10% in only one of the last 20 years. In essence, black America 
has been in a depression for the last two decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The people in these most ravaged precincts are in deep pain and, except for 
political bombast about crime and the end of "welfare as we know it," the rest 
of America hardly notices. The traditional black leaders, though they have 
tried mightily, are unable to change this. Neither can Farrakhan, but he and 
his lieutenants can set the night on fire with cries of venom that unleash the 
clotted rage of the dispossessed and others -- like college students -- who see 
what is going on but are powerless to change things. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hard for black leaders, especially politicians who represent America's 
most injured people, to wander out on the wrong side of these three curves. But 
this has severely strained the social-justice alliance that proved so fruitful 
in the past. We tend to romanticize the civil-rights era. There was, indeed, 
great cooperation between idealistic and activist Jews and blacks. But most 
Jews and most blacks did not participate in the civil-rights movement. And 
since there is a lot of racism and a lot of anti-Semitism in our culture, there 
are and always have been anti-Semitic blacks and racist Jews. But the major 
voices in those days were civil, warm and aligned. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite frictions about black demands for local control of schools in New 
York, antagonism from some Jewish precincts to affirmative action, differences 
about the Palestinian and South African problems, many Jews and blacks engaged 
in social-justice work have continued their cooperation over the years on a 
range of issues. Jackson's strong efforts to make amends for his gaffes of a 
decade ago have been helpful. But until now, Farrakhan has been a continuing 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from reactions to the current controversy from Black Caucus members 
such as John Lewis of Georgia, Major R. Owens of New York and Albert R. Wynn of 
Maryland, there is little appetite now -- if there ever was -- for a covenant 
with Farrakhan. That should ease tensions between blacks and Jews; as should 
the denunciations of the Muhammad speech by such prominent black figures as 
Jackson, Mfume and William H. Gray III of the United Negro College Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrakhan has now deepened his isolation by endorsing the substance of 
Muhammad's rabid and anti-human speech. Though black-Jewish relations are 
strengthened by all this, the big winner is the black leadership. Farrakhan's 
inability to shake his obsession with Jews has always been at odds with the 
humanity and morality at the core of the African American struggle for justice. 
Blacks resented demands that they denounce Farrakhan, because they did not want 
others to dictate their message. But part of the decency of that message was 
diluted from the fringe. With his stubborn adherence to the substance of his 
subordinate's vile message, Farrakhan himself has now handed control of their 
message back to the mainstream black leaders.*

THE EARTHQUAKE REVIVES THE TAX-AND-SPEND DEBATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, Sherry Bebitch Jeffe, a contributing editor to 
Opinion, is a senior associate at the Center for Politics and Economics at 
Claremont Graduate School and a political analyst for KCAL-TV. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just as the 1992 riots redefined the dynamics of Los Angeles' mayoral 
election, the Northridge earthquake may reshape the 1994 race for gover nor. 
The pre-quake hot-button issues of crime and immigration, though still potent, 
have slid a notch or two down California's political agenda. Taxes and 
government are moving up. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic debate appears to center on what constitutes "good government." 
Where does responsibility for Southern California's recovery lie? Who should 
care for its residents' needs? Who should pay? How? How much? It's been quite a 
while -- indeed, too long -- since a political campaign in California raised 
such fundamental questions of governing. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, to listen to some political observers, you'd think the governmental 
responses to the earthquake were engineered just to improve the position of 
certain politicians heading into an election year. But when events become the 
driving force, it's harder for candidates to define themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, Gov. Pete Wilson and one Democratic challenger, state Insurance 
Commissioner John Garamendi, have logged heavy media time as they have gone 
about their jobs. The leadership stage was legitimately theirs -- and they took 
it. But if the recovery stumbles, they'll be tarred with failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi lags behind Wilson and state Treasurer Kathleen Brown, another 
Democratic gubernatorial contender, in fund-raising. He needs visibility, and 
the earthquake gave it to him. Brown, on the other hand, appeared absent from 
battle during the critical days after the temblor. Perhaps it was because the 
media dismissed her office as irrelevant to crisis management. Or perhaps the 
Brown campaign realized that high-flying maneuvers by a public official on the 
periphery could backfire politically. 
</P>
<P>
 "Toughness" has been a byword of Wilson's term in office. And in the past two 
weeks, he has looked good as a crisis manager. Fifty-eight percent of Los 
Angeles County residents surveyed by The Los Angeles Times Poll approved of the 
governor's post-quake performance. Nonetheless, what could have been a major 
political plus for Wilson may not turn out that way. A clue to his problem lies 
in the 70%-plus approval ratings respondents gave President Bill Clinton and 
Mayor Richard Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 In the disaster's aftermath, Clinton and Riordan both showed "connectivity," 
the ability to relate to people and their concerns on an emotional level and to 
sound credible doing it. Voters look for connectivity in their leaders, 
especially during a crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson lacks that ability. Garamendi, with his faded jeans and rolled-up shirt 
sleeves, is trying to persuade voters that he has it. Brown is nothing if not 
warm and fuzzy -- relentlessly connecting. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson understands that Californians are not going to vote for him because 
he's lovable. So he's tried to differentiate himself on issues that concern 
voters more than bedside manner. For example, he clearly had the momentum on 
crime, with his main target being Brown. But the earthquake may have given her 
a reprieve, however brief, from Wilson's attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake's damage has helped to make taxes a defining issue among the 
candidates. Wilson is pushing hard -- some say too hard -- for the federal 
government to pick up all recovery costs. He has shied away from any tax 
increases to pay for earthquake repairs, while talking up the possibility of 
placing a bond issue on the June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving himself the kind of wiggle room the hapless George Bush never did, 
Wilson recently contended, "At a time when Californians are attempting to 
recover from a recession, we don't need additional tax burdens." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has taken a similarly cautious stance on taxes, although separating 
herself from Wilson's hard line on federal government support. She has called 
for immediate use of unsold bond funds and loans from state programs to rebuild 
schools and other public agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, as befits the perceived underdog in the Democratic race, has taken 
the biggest political risk. Insisting an election-year tax increase is 
necessary to pay for earthquake recovery, he is setting up taxes as a potential 
wedge issue in the Democratic gubernatorial primary. "Anybody who says we are 
going to do this without a temporary tax increase," he lectured a recent 
Washington news conference, "is either a fool or a liar." 
</P>
<P>
 The last politician who was that honest about raising taxes was Walter F. 
Mondale, when he accepted the 1984 presidential nomination of the Democratic 
Party. Ten years later, is talk of raising taxes still political suicide? 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll indicates there is some support for an earthquake-repair levy, 
even in quake-affected communities traditionally home to more conservative, 
anti-tax, high-propensity voters. Sixty-four percent of the respondents in the 
San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys indicated they would support a one-year, 
one-quarter-cent sales tax (as compared with 68% of all L.A. County 
respondents). And 49% supported raising the gas tax by 2 to 4 cents a gallon 
(as compared with 52% of all L.A. County respondents). 
</P>
<P>
 There's some electoral evidence that voters will support higher taxes tied to 
programs that directly benefit them. In 1990, for example, Californians 
approved an increase in the state gas tax to pay for transportation projects, 
and last year they supported a one-half-cent sales tax to be used for 
public-safety programs. Will the quake have a similar effect on white, 
middle-class voters whose lives have been disrupted? 
</P>
<P>
 Another critical issue that has surfaced in the post-quake political debate is 
the relevance of government to the lives of these people. In some respects, the 
Northridge quake has functioned as a great equalizer. "Amateur" homeless, as 
the middle-class dispossessed are derisively called, have joined the ranks of 
street people. And it has been government that has stepped in to supply them 
with water, housing and money -- things they thought their tax dollars bought 
only for less-deserving "others." 
</P>
<P>
 Will this brush with government activism score politically with hard-hit 
suburban voters? Currently, public perception of the government's 
post-earthquake action appears to be positive. Fifty-nine percent of The Times 
Poll respondents (61% in the Valley) approved of the activities of the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency. Eighty-four percent rated government agencies' 
efforts to repair freeways as excellent or good. 
</P>
<P>
 If that perception holds -- and there's still a long way to go -- it could 
signal a change of heart among cynical California voters. Politically, 
increased approval of government activism could benefit Democrats this year, 
particularly in close legislative and congressional elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Events since Jan. 17 have underscored, once again, that good government is 
good politics. The problem is that Californians, and their political leaders, 
are far from consensus on exactly what good government is. If they can move 
beyond the sloganeering and simplistic posturing that dominated state politics 
before the quake hit and seriously debate what good government is, this 
election campaign could signal that California has finally begun to turn itself 
around.*

WILL 'WHO LOST RUSSIA?' BECOME 'WHO LOST EUROPE?' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By James A. Baker III, James A. Baker III is former U.S. secretary of state. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the wake of the fascist and communist surge in Russia's December elections 
and the resignations of prominent reformers, pundits are already asking, "Who 
lost Russia?" But this is not the right question. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's why: U.S. interests in Russian reform are part and parcel of America's 
broader interests in a secure, democratic and prosperous Europe. By focusing on 
Moscow, to the detriment of our other interests, we run the risk of failing to 
consolidate democratic gains in Central and Eastern Europe. The fading fortunes 
of economic reform in countries formerly behind the Iron Curtain have fed an 
alarming rise in virulent nationalism -- even neo-fascism. The nightmare 
America and her allies must avoid is a fractured and fascist Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, most observers have only noticed the bad news out of Moscow. The twin 
champions of reform, Prime Minister Yegor T. Gaidar and Finance Minister Boris 
G. Fyodorov, have resigned -- with the latter blasting Strobe Talbott, the 
State Department's "Russia czar" and soon-to-be deputy secretary of state. A 
cast of apparatchiks have seemingly taken control. These events have caused 
consternation in Western capitals, but talk of a "lost" Russia is wrongheaded, 
for at least two reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 First, Russia has not been "lost." In microeconomic terms, the economic 
situation has improved, in many respects, over the last year. More than 75% of 
Russia's small businesses and retail shops are in private hands. More than 25% 
of the labor force is employed in the private sector.  
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the growth of the private sector has been accompanied by a 
rampant increase in organized -- and violent -- crime. Bribery and corruption 
are widespread tools of business. Reformers, like Democrats in Washington, need 
to become as anti-crime as their opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 The main risk to reform is on the macroeconomic front. Fyodorov's efforts had 
just begun to pay off. Inflation was coming down. Indeed, the chief impediment 
to bringing inflation under control was -- and is -- Central Bank Chairman 
Viktor V. Gerashchenko, a communist holdover and bitter opponent of reform. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why the resignations are so disturbing. Personnel determine policy. 
With the departure of the reformers and their replacement by "Red managers," 
there are few left in Moscow's upper reaches -- other than Boris N. Yeltsin 
himself -- with any tested commitment to reform. These resignations are 
reminiscent of Eduard A. Shevardnadze's resignation as Soviet foreign minister 
in 1990. President Mikhail S. Gorbachev felt he could continue reform without 
his trusted colleague -- only to have his new associates from the old guard 
attempt to depose him in a coup. 
</P>
<P>
 Gains made by Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky's Liberal Democratic Party -- neither 
liberal nor democratic nor truly a party -- in the Dec. 12 elections are a 
basic cause of much of Russia's current turmoil. They reveal the extent of 
popular opposition to Yeltsin's economic reform program and the people's 
willingness to look for simplistic solutions. Yet, the Russian people also 
approved a constitution giving the government, not the Parliament, power. It is 
not whistling past the graveyard to say Yeltsin has the tools to accelerate 
reform. The question is: Does he have the will -- and the personnel -- to do 
so? 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the West cannot "lose" Russia. Russia can be "lost" -- but only by the 
Russian people and their leaders. Russia is a nation of more than 150 million 
people, spanning 12 time zones. Great powers are "great" primarily because they 
determine their own destinies. Ultimately, the choices Russians make will shape 
their future. Only they can lose a nascent democratic Russia to fascism or 
communism. 
</P>
<P>
 What the West can lose, however, is the opportunity to reshape Europe. While 
the West's influence over events in Russia is marginal, our influence over 
events in the emerging democracies of Central and Eastern Europe can be 
decisive. But recent events there have been no more conducive to reform than 
those in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 In Belarus, Prime Minister Stanislav Shushkevich, another committed reformer, 
has been ousted by Parliament for pushing reform too aggressively and failing 
to align Minsk's foreign policy with Moscow's. In Kiev, the Parliament has 
again failed to ratify the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. This despite the 
Clinton Administration's promise to double aid to the Ukrainian government so 
it will do the very thing it has promised us twice before it would do. 
Meanwhile, inflation in Ukraine has reached 100% a month, effectively 
undermining the people's economic independence. And in recent elections in the 
Crimea, a Russian secessionist won 73% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Farther west, in the Balkans, the war winds on -- and up, not down. The 
Bosnian Serbs have instituted a general mobilization. There are reports both 
Serbia and Croatia are sending regular army units into Bosnia-Herzegovina. In 
Belgrade on a trip, Zhirinovsky tied these events together when he said, "The 
retreat has ended, we are launching a general offensive, let all our enemies 
fear us. . . . Let them squirm in Paris, London, Washington and Tel Aviv." 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky's trip to the Balkans symbolizes the danger the West faces. We 
should take him seriously -- both because of what he says and where he says it. 
</P>
<P>
 By his words, Zhirinovsky tells us what he opposes. Except for Serbian "ethnic 
cleansing," what he supports is unclear. He is against democracy; against free 
markets; against the West, and against non-Russians and nonwhites -- depending 
on the audience. Anger over Russia's losses is his driving force, as is 
resentment against those who allegedly caused them: Westerners, capitalists, 
Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhirinovsky is, plain and simple, a fascist. The nation is supreme, the 
individual subservient. To him, being Russian is intrinsically good. Being 
anything else is intrinsically bad -- unless for tactical purposes he wants to 
unite Russians with Serbs in a Slavic brotherhood or Russians with white 
Europeans and Americans against the "blacks."  
</P>
<P>
 Where he's been making his pronouncements is equally disturbing. Last week, he 
found a receptive audience in Serbia. He and Serbian strongman Slobodan 
Milosevic are, in many ways, soul mates. Each feeds on a hypernationalism that 
combines authoritarianism at home with contempt for everything foreign. 
</P>
<P>
 The danger is that the Milosevics and the Zhirinovskys will continue to preach 
their message of intolerance and hate, even conspiring in their efforts, 
putting pressure on other leaders to "defend" their peoples. Soon, ethnicity, 
not democracy, could become the organizing principle for the region. History 
would tell us that's likely. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's where that could lead. Serbia could extend its ethnic cleansing to 
Albanians in Kosovo and Sandjak and to Hungarians in Vojvodina. Tensions could 
increase between Greece and Albania over the Albanians already expelled from 
Greece and the 60,000 to 300,000 Greeks living in Albania. (So contentious is 
the issue already that Greece and Albania cannot agree on the actual number.) 
</P>
<P>
 These tensions are likely to rebound in Turkey -- where there will be calls 
for defense of the primarily Muslim Albanians, as well as the approximately 
800,000 ethnic Turks in Bulgaria. Hungarian nationalists could come to power on 
promises to protect the more than 4 million ethnic Hungarians in neighboring 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this pales in comparison with the potential conflicts over the 25 
million Russians living in the "near abroad." Obviously, the Baltics are a 
flash point. But so, too, are northern Kazakhstan and eastern Ukraine -- where 
many Russians live and nuclear weapons remain. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, U.S. interests in Europe and Eurasia comprise more than who does 
what to whom inside the Kremlin walls. Not all problems in Europe can be solved 
via the Moscow-Washington hot line. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks ahead, President Bill Clinton and his key aides need to ask and 
answer five questions: 
</P>
<P>
 One, how can the West contain the conflict in the Balkans and prevent it from 
becoming a broader Balkan war? The West may not be able to stop the war in 
Bosnia at an acceptable cost, but with resolve and foresight, it can prevent 
one from starting in Macedonia, Albania, Hungary or other neighboring states. 
</P>
<P>
 Two, how can the West integrate those Central and Eastern European democracies 
that meet objective criteria (e.g., Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic) for 
full membership in Western institutions? The Partnership for Peace is an 
evasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, how can we promote the independence of the non-Russian former Soviet 
states while working to denuclearize them? Clinton missed an opportunity to 
support democracy when he failed to visit Kyrgyzstan. Under Askar Akayev, this 
state is moving toward democracy and hasn't made and then broken promises. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth, what can be done to support democracy and free markets in Russia -- 
now that most reformers have left the government? Let's hope the West doesn't 
panic and cut off support to reformers at the local levels and in the private 
sector who now desperately need our support. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, what can Washington do to increase West-West coordination and 
cooperation? If America and her West European allies can't agree on a course of 
action, then a Europe whole and free surely will be lost to a Europe fractured 
and fascist. Then the question will not be, "Who lost Russia?" It will be, "Who 
lost Europe?"*

CALIFORNIANS AND THEIR CARS: THE TIES THAT CONTINUE TO BIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Fred M.H. Gregory 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My favorite image of Southern California lies at the end of the road, just 
around the last bend of the I-10. You drive through a dim tunnel, and suddenly 
it hits you like a blinding vision from God -- shimmering white sand, a 
brilliant sky and the breaking surf of the Pacific -- framed by an arch of 
concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 I used to tell first-time visitors to Los Angeles to drive west on the Santa 
Monica Freeway till you ran out of continent. They were always surprised and 
captivated by that amazing sight, that golden glimpse of a California just as 
they had always dreamed it would be. Well, now you can't get there from here -- 
here being any place east of La Brea -- and the idea of Southern California as 
a vision of paradise seen best through the windshield of a car, lies shattered 
like the Santa Monica Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Some see this as a good thing. These neo-utopians hope that out of disaster 
will Fred M.H. Gregory is a contributing editor to Car and Driver magazine.  
</P>
<P>
 come the opportunity to free us from the odious steel capsules that clog our 
streets, poison our air and separate us from meaningful discourse with our 
fellow beings. They see a millennium where we shuttle from home to work in 
shiny rail cars or commuter vans, where parking lots become village greens and 
where most cars sit collecting dust in the garage or, better yet, moldering in 
some scrap yard, awaiting the crusher. 
</P>
<P>
 An idyllic vision, to be sure -- but don't bet on it. Our city and the way we 
live are intertwined with the automobile, and as long as there's an ounce of 
oil under Kuwait, it will probably stay that way. The car is to Los Angeles 
what the gondola is to Venice -- a city symbol that's inextricably linked to 
our history and culture. And that's how we want it, even if we hate to admit 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 This has nothing to do with our alleged love affair with the car. People don't 
fall for hardware. This absurd notion was probably dreamed up by some New York 
intellectual whose bicycle was just stolen. If anything, we take the car for 
granted; it's part of our stuff, like a woman's purse or an agent's tasseled 
loafers. 
</P>
<P>
 Our cars are accessories we change with our mood and circumstances. A writer 
sells a script and it's goodby Nissan Sentra, hello Lamborghini Diablo. A 
bodybuilder bulks up his curb appeal with a big-wheeled Jeep, and a mom and dad 
shuttle the kids in a Ford Explorer complete with ski rack and rhino guards. 
</P>
<P>
 We even transform our cars to suit our taste. Westside high-rollers replace 
the mundane tires of their Mercedes SL's with racy-looking Pirellis mounted on 
$1,000 magnesium wheels. Kids in Koreatown lower their Honda Civics, bolt on 
fiberglass spoilers and fender flares and careen around the neighborhood. In 
East Los Angeles, compact pickups as colorful as pinatas cruise the boulevards, 
their 500-watt sound systems putting out a bass wave powerful enough to 
collapse a bystander's lungs -- and soon people all over the country pick up on 
the style. Next to movies, car culture could be our biggest export. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it any wonder that nearly all the world's car companies have studios 
scattered around Southern California so their designers can find inspiration? 
Automotive fashion was born here. Harley Earl, Detroit's first auto stylist, 
learned how to do it in Pasadena from coach builders who were creating custom 
Duesenbergs for the rich and famous. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the world's great cities, Los Angeles is the only one that passed from 
infancy to maturity in this century. It isn't a collection of baggage from the 
past, like the ancient European and Asian metropolises. It doesn't owe anything 
to the 19th Century -- which set the shape of New York and the other Eastern 
cities. The growth of Los Angeles parallels the evolution of the automobile. 
Its scale was determined by the car and built to accommodate it. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles, after all, was the terminus of Route 66, and all those early 
settlers who chugged out here in their Model T's weren't about to give up their 
new-found freedom to drive around at will. So they built the first freeway and 
went on to web the city with the finest highways in the world. They invented 
drive-in commerce and perfected the drive-in restaurant -- though history gives 
credit for the first one to Royce Harley's Pig Stand in Dallas. Just for fun, 
they created hot-rodding and laid out the first drag strip, in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 People muse wistfully about the Red Car lines that once connected the region's 
distant hamlets, about how civilized and charming they were. In fact, when the 
opportunity arose, Angelenos of the day scrapped the red rattletraps without 
regret in favor of more freeways, more roads and more cars. 
</P>
<P>
 I have little doubt that most of us prefer our cars to any of the 
alternatives, such as they are. Our public transportation is simply incapable 
of getting us to most of the places we might want to go. People point to the 
recent popularity of Metro Link as a sure sign of the future. My survey of one 
rider indicates otherwise. She lives in Canyon Country and works in Highland 
Park, and when her link between the two was severed by the quake, she bought a 
week's worth of Metro Link tickets. Before she used the first one, it occurred 
to her that she'd have to drive to the station, ride the train, then figure out 
how to get from Glendale to Highland Park. Couldn't be done. At least not any 
faster than driving, even with the inconvenience of a detour. I have a feeling 
she is not an isolated example. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't expect to see much more than a few miles of Metro, Blue Line and 
light-rail tracks being laid in my lifetime. A city still spooked by the ghost 
of Howard Jarvis is not likely to spend billions for a Parisian-style 
transportation system. Who needs it when we already have a mass-transit system 
that requires no waiting on platforms, is private and relatively safe and runs 
according to our own schedules -- it's called the car. 
</P>
<P>
 We'll stay in our cars because we like them and need them. We expect them to 
be there when we want them and to get us where we want to go. If we live in 
Santa Monica and decide to drive over to Monterey Park for some Beijing duck, 
we'll still do it. If the Santa Monica Freeway is folded up like some piece of 
reinforced-concrete origami, we'll figure out a way to get around it. Just like 
Londoners in the blitz, we will muddle through, developing a new sense of urban 
cunning as we go. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't expect to hear taps sounding over the automobile just yet. It's going to 
take more than a 6.6 earthquake to shake us from behind the wheel. Besides, 
we'll need our cars when the Big One hits, so that those who survive can get 
the hell out of town.*

THE MAYANS: A NEW FORCE IN GUATEMALAN POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Victor Perera, Victor Perera, who teaches at the Graduate School of 
Journalism at UC Berkeley, is the author of Unfinished Conquest: The Guatemalan 
Tragedy and Rites: A Guatemalan Boyhood, due out in paperback from Mercury 
House next fall. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new, indigenous opposition is emerging in Guatemala that could determine the 
fate of President Ramiro de Leon Carpio's anti-corrup tion constitutional 
reforms, ap proved last Sunday in a referendum that attracted fewer than 20% of 
the country's eligible voters. More significant, this coalition of Mayan 
popular groups could dictate the terms for the next round of peace talks, set 
later this month in Mexico City, between the Guatemalan government and the 
leftist guerrillas of the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Union. Previous 
negotiations broke down over the issue of accountability for human-rights 
violations against the Mayan communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Last June, delegates from four indigenous organizations met in the offices of 
the National Committee of Guatemalan Widows to elect the leaders of the new 
coalition. The three organizations, in addition to the Widows, were the 
Communities of Population in Resistance, the Runujel Junam Council of Ethnic 
Communities and the Permanent Commission for Refugees, which oversees the 
repatriation of 45,000 Guatemalans who have lived in camps along the Mexican 
border for more than a decade. A fifth member of the coalition, which did not 
send a delegate, is the Group of Mutual Support, composed of families of 
Guatemalans disappeared by the military. 
</P>
<P>
 The emerging Mayan coalition represents an interesting historical convergence; 
each of these organizations, headed by indigenous Mayan militants, has been 
associated with the Guatemalan National Revolutionary Union. The alliance 
entered into by these groups thus amounts to a joint declaration of 
independence from their guerrilla mentors. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the five groups, the Communities of Population in Resistance is the largest 
and most disciplined. Its origins date from the military's counterinsurgency 
campaign of the late 1970s and early '80s. The scorched-earth practices 
introduced by President Romeo Lucas Garcia and expanded under evangelical 
President Efrain Rios Montt destroyed more than 440 villages and killed an 
estimated 60,000 Highland Mayas. Another million and a half were forced to 
leave their homes, with as many as two-thirds fleeing into Mexico. Most 
continued north. 
</P>
<P>
 The other half-million Guatemalans who fled became internal refugees, or 
desplazados . The majority drifted to Guatemala City and smaller towns, where 
they scratch out menial livings. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50,000 Mayas from the northern and western Highlands fled to a lowland 
zone of northern Quiche Department known as Ixcan, where they survived on a 
bare-subsistence diet. These desplazados joined together to form the 
Communities of Population in Resistance. In the early years, they maintained 
their solidarity with the leftist guerrillas who had been active in their home 
villages. Early visitors to the Ixcan were often greeted by raised fists and 
shouted Marxist slogans, mixed with a humbling and open-handed Mayan 
hospitality. 
</P>
<P>
 A Chinese-Guatemalan investigator, Myrna Mack Chang, was among the first to 
bring the Communities to the attention of the outside world. Her report was 
careful not to blame the military directly for the plight of these displaced 
Mayas; nevertheless, her implicit denunciation cost Myrna Mack her life. 
</P>
<P>
 The evolution of the Communities of Population into a close-knit, disciplined 
organization is one of the intriguing stories of contemporary Guatemala. Today, 
the army continues to harass the group with bombing raids and public-relations 
jibes depicting them as handmaidens of armed subversion. Representatives of 
international organizations, including a human-rights special envoy from the 
United Nations, have visited these communities. They have been astounded by 
their high morale and tight discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 The Communities of Population's chief objective, apart from survival, is to 
call the world's attention to the atrocities committed by the army against 
Highland Mayan communities, in its pursuit of victory over the leftist 
guerrillas who used the Mayan villages as their bases of popular support. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the organizations is working to expand the political space, or 
apertura , by attacking the most repressive institutions of the Guatemalan 
army. The Runujel Junam Council of Ethnic Communities, focuses on dismantling 
the army's unconstitutional civil-defense patrols, which enlist hundreds of 
thousands of Highland Mayas to carry out the military's dirty work of 
counterinsurgency. 
</P>
<P>
 The Permanent Commission on Refugees has collaborated with the United Nations 
to resettle nearly 5,000 of the 45,000 Guatemalans in Mexican camps. Thousands 
more are streaming back since the uprising by fellow Mayas of the Zapatista 
Army of National Liberation in Chiapas on Jan. 1. The head of the Permanent 
Commission, Ricardo Curtz, has resisted the army's attempts to sow dissension 
among the refugees by accusing their leaders of collaborating with the 
guerrillas. Most of the repatriated Guatemalans have settled in the Ixcan, a 
few hours' walk from the Communities of Population in Resistance. The two 
groups' proven ability to survive under impossibly harsh conditions, plus their 
shared history of persecution by the army, make them natural allies. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Committee of Guatemalan Widows, headed by the resolute Cakchiquel 
Mayan former widow, Rosalina Tuyuc, has earned the army's sworn enmity by her 
efforts to abolish the forced recruitment of teen-age Highland males, whose 
communal bonds are systematically broken by military training before they are 
sent back to the Highlands as soldiers to prey on their own people. 
</P>
<P>
 The election of delegates in the National Committee of Guatemalan Widows' 
offices was particularly impressive for its attention to democratic procedure. 
With the possible exception of Rigoberta Menchu's 1992 Nobel Peace prize, no 
other event highlights more dramatically the preponderance of human rights in 
the emergence of a New Maya from the ashes of the military's 30-year war of 
counterinsurgency. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Mayan opposition made its influence felt in the low turnout in last 
Sunday's referendum. The 43 constitutional amendments approved by the voters 
called for the dissolution of congress and the supreme court. But although they 
included concessions to the chambers of commerce and finance, the reforms did 
not address the issues embodied by the new coalition: the abolition of 
civil-defense patrols; the end of forced military recruitment; the appointment 
of an independent truth commission to investigate human-rights violations; 
agrarian reform and other economic incentives for Guatemala's indigenous 
majority. In coming weeks, as De Leon attempts to enforce the reforms, his 
shaky presidency may depend increasingly for its survival on the support of 
Menchu and the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The aging guerrilla leaders headed for the peace talks will also have to take 
the new Mayan coalition into account, if they, the Guatemalan government and 
the mediators for both sides hope to bring Latin America's longest-lasting 
undeclared war to a merciful end.*

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; JEAN-JACQUES BEINEIX; DEFENDING THE FRENCH FILM 
INDUSTRY AGAINST A GLOBAL U.S. MOVIE MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Scott Kraft, Scott Kraft, Paris bureau chief for The Times, interviewed 
Jean-Jacques Beineix in the Paris offices of Cargo Films, the director's 
production company. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first feature film Jean-Jacques Beineix directed was the kind no Hollywood 
studio would have made. It had a paltry $1 million budget. No name stars. 
Everyone speaking a foreign language. And, of course, a first-time director at 
the helm. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, his 1981 thriller, "Diva," became a critical and commercial success in 
the United States, where it is still among the 10 most-successful foreign 
films. Beineix was hailed as a genius and compared to Orson Welles. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was only natural that the director, now 47, and still one of France's 
most gifted filmmakers watched the recent world-trade talks, and especially the 
battle between French filmmakers and Hollywood studios, with deep concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply put, Hollywood wants the French government to level the playing field 
for entertainment programming by eliminating subsidies for French films and 
minimum quotas for French TV programming. But to the French, guardians of 
Europe's only flourishing film industry, Hollywood's efforts are an unabashed 
attempt to crush France's cultural heritage. France managed to keep the whole 
issue out of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, but the war for the 
big and small screens of France is far from over. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past year, eight of the 10 top-grossing films in France have been 
American. (The only two French films on the list, "Les Visiteurs" and 
"Germinal," are scheduled for U.S. release later this year.) 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute recently reached its nadir when the French producer Daniel Toscan 
du Plantier suggested that the Los Angeles earthquake was a sign that God had 
taken the French side on the issue. (Toscan du Plantier later apologized for 
his "bad private joke." Jack Valenti, head of the Motion Picture Assn. of 
America, accepted the apology.) Although Beineix and other French actors, 
producers and directors have sharply criticized Toscan du Plantier's "joke," 
they remain angered by Hollywood's designs on the French market. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of a Paris insurance salesman, Beineix fell in love with films as a 
youngster, feasting on the classic French works but also on the films of such 
Americans as Welles, John Huston, Woody Allen and Jerry Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 Beineix studied medicine but quit school after three years to work as an 
assistant director on several dozen films. Since "Diva," he has directed four 
films, including "Betty Blue," a modest success in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Beineix works out of an old building in northern Paris, next door to an 
X-rated movie house, and he recently finished several long TV documentaries. 
His most recent feature, "IP5," starring Yves Montand in the late actor's last 
role, made a modest profit in France, though it has yet to find a U.S. 
distributor. "A lot of people were interested, but nothing happened," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Jack Valenti, head of the Motion Picture Assn. of America, contends 
that French films should compete with American films on an equal footing and 
let the audiences decide which films they like best. What's wrong with that?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: What Valenti is talking about is business and, business-wise, he is 
right. But our civilization needs something else. Our fight is to tell this 
(American) lobby that we need some room to express ourselves, not we as French 
or Italians but we citizens of the world -- Japanese artists, Mexicans artists, 
Brazilian artists, whoever they are. 
</P>
<P>
 We know that the strategy of these companies is to make a profit as quickly as 
possible. They now see no difference between making a film and taking out an 
insurance policy. They want insurance for success. 
</P>
<P>
 But creativity is something else. You don't have to always increase a movie's 
pace, become more violent and less intelligent. We don't have to give people 
what they expect instead of trying to raise their expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 That is why I think we are rendering an extremely important service to this 
business. Let's say, it's a kind of research. Even Hollywood needs some fresh 
blood. We are investing in research, and this research will help the system of 
filmmaking to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Meaning the French film industry?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Not just French. It is the same for a lot of artists in America. This is 
not a fight against America at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But by erecting barriers to American entertainment in France, isn't France 
practicing blatant protectionism?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It is very easy to talk about protectionism. But is it protectionism to 
save something that belongs to the heritage of the human community? 
</P>
<P>
 America has always fought monopolies. It is even in your law. So if you accuse 
us of protectionism, then we must accuse you of monopolizing 80% of our market. 
</P>
<P>
 So, we just want some room so that all the people interested in this type of 
creation could have some room for their own sake. And I think the system would 
be much smarter to help this cinema exist. If you don't, you will slowly reduce 
the audience's choices. And I think that is a big mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But let's take Jean Renoir, one of France's greatest directors. He didn't 
need protection.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Who needed protection in that time in the business? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So you think things have changed?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The rules have changed. We are in a position now where a foreign industry 
has 80% of our market and looking for 100% . . . . So I tell the Americans, be 
careful. You are going to lose a lot of image. The feeling of anti-Americanism 
is growing. And the American industry has more to lose than to win. The 
Japanese went too far in America, and it created a backlash. The same will 
happen in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But the fact is that the most popular films in French cinemas today are 
American. Do you think French filmmakers have lost touch with their audience?  
</P>
<P>
 A: This trade fight has nothing to do with America or Europe. It is about 
values, artistic points of view, independence and freedom. The cinema is a 
place of freedom; it is a place where people can express themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But what's wrong with making films that audiences want to see? Isn't that 
the point of making films?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Let's say you have two products. One is selling very well, the other isn't. 
Is it because the first product is better than the second or is it because the 
marketing is better? 
</P>
<P>
 The crisis of our cinema is almost an ideological crisis. The audiences do not 
believe in themselves anymore. So they would rather go and see an American 
film, which is bringing them far from their home, far from their country, and 
they will dream about something they do not know about. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't have the feeling that our films are less interesting than the usual 
American film. I would say our countries have the same average of good and bad 
films. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Then why aren't French films more popular in the world?  
</P>
<P>
 A: You have to know that our language is a language spoken by maybe 1%, 2%, 3% 
of the people in the world. We do not sell abroad. American films do sell 
abroad. With this market, they can have the money for the distribution, they 
can spend the money to advertise, make prints, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 We could improve the quality of our films, of course. But much of it is purely 
technical and financial. A lot of people in this country have the talent to do 
those big American-style films. But we do not have the market. That is the 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 We are now -- and this is what I think is unfair -- investing in research for 
a lot of talent that will work later in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is there some essential difference between French and American films?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't think so. But the big American films are mainly action films, with 
violence and big stars. Look at "Cliffhanger." I went to see that picture. It 
was entertaining, but I couldn't help thinking, is this going to be something 
you are proud to leave your children? 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think it is being unfair to ask this industry to spend a little bit of 
its money to find people like John Ford, Hemingway, Welles. 
</P>
<P>
 Just because these films please an international audience doesn't mean it's 
good cinema. Would you say a hamburger was a gastronomic success in the history 
of cooking? No, but it is a very easy way to provide the biggest number of 
people with the simplest food possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Cinema should do more than just feed people with ready-made, easily 
recognizable products. I expect more. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So you don't think that French cinema would survive without protection, 
without some government assistance?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Well, here I think there is a big misunderstanding. The decision of this 
country to take a percentage of the profits and use it to help fund the next 
project is an investment in the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 When you just consider cinema to be a product, you have a problem. If you let 
the market make all the decisions about pacing, actors and even good and bad 
endings, then it doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 Our (French) system allows us to take some of these risks, to have first-time 
directors and unknown actors. "Diva" would never had been made by a studio. 
"Betty Blue" would never, never had been made by a studio. I find new actors 
all the time. That would be impossible if it had been a studio approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this hell, is this the end of the world? No, I think it is a nice system. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But if films can't survive on their own, with audiences willing to buy 
tickets, maybe they shouldn't exist.  
</P>
<P>
 A: No, No, No. Would you say autistic children shouldn't survive because they 
can't survive on their own? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Surely you're not saying the French film industry is handicapped?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No. But because we are small, because obviously the rules of 
standardization, rough-and-tough liberalization will not allow the system to 
survive, we should still be allowed to render a service to the community of 
artists worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 I think it is common sense to say you can't treat the values of intelligence 
and creativity the way you do soap or soup or cars. Sincerely. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you think about the American film business today?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I've become disillusioned. After "Diva," I was almost ready to emigrate (to 
the United States) because I had the feeling that Europe was old-fashioned and 
decaying. But then I discovered that Hollywood was decaying, too. Not because 
of the people . . . but because of the mentality, the greediness. 
</P>
<P>
 This business is really a business, and artists have become some kind of 
strange, difficult beings. I thought that Hollywood was the place you could 
make dreams come true, where adventure was possible. But it is just 
bureaucratic, and it's less and less involved in creation and creativity. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You had a big success with "Diva" in the United States, and yet you have 
had only one other film, "Betty Blue," distributed there. Why is that?  
</P>
<P>
 A: At first, Hollywood saw me as some kind of exotic puppet. I was pretty hot 
at the time, and they were saying, "Well, he did this 'Diva' for $1 million; 
let's have him do another one for the same amount, but for an American 
audience." An American audience? I still don't understand what that means, but 
I've heard it a lot.*

CAMPUS CORRESPONDENCE; HOW OUR BIGGEST NEWS STORY ALMOST GOT AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL BOND, Paul Bond is editor-in-chief of the Sundial, the Cal State 
Northridge newspaper. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It should have been an easy task. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspaper was already laid out in preparation for the Jan. 17 deadline of 
the 35,000-issue mail-out registra tion edition. I, of course, knew what the 
headline would read: Earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 It took three hours to drive the 20 miles to campus. Once there, I flashed my 
press pass at one of the police officers who surrounded the university. 
</P>
<P>
 "The campus is closed to everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 That was 20 days ago -- and still no paper. Since the Northridge earthquake, 
my staff and I had assembled photos and stories that, in a morbid sort of way, 
are the envy of any university newspaper in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 We had spoken to some of the survivors of the Northridge Meadows, where 16 
people, including two Cal State Northridge students, were killed when the 
apartment complex pancaked. We had stories on students, some of whom had never 
experienced an earthquake, who told tales of being homeless and of sleeping in 
tents. We had interviews with state senators, a congressman and CSUN President 
Blenda J. Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 We had photos of the university's science complex in flames, its library in 
shambles and its $14-million "earthquake resistant" parking structure 
splattered. 
</P>
<P>
 So why did the Sundial sit on the most important edition in its entire 
history?  
</P>
<P>
 The building that houses the Sundial offices has officially been declared 
"stable" and safe to re-enter, but staff members are not allowed in. Not even 
for five minutes, which was all the time needed to get the ads that were sold 
for the mail-out edition. The administration, apparently, was unwilling to 
allow the Sundial to be published without the $18,000 worth of ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Is this any way for a college newspaper to operate? Especially at a time of 
extraordinary circumstances, when students, more than ever, are dependent for 
information on the newspaper? 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson and other administrators have been supportive. "We want you to get a 
paper out; you're our only link to the student," they told us. "You have our 
support. Do whatever it takes." 
</P>
<P>
 As long as it doesn't cost $18,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But why did the administration spend a whole lot more money to buy ads in The 
Times and Daily News to convey the same information to students that the 
Sundial edition would have? To add insult to injury, the journalism department 
even considered having us publish a four- to eight-page follow-up quake edition 
-- without ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, as a result of the generosity of California State University, Los 
Angeles, which allowed us to use its facilities, the edition of a lifetime was 
mailed out Thursday -- with the ads. But should the "only link to the student" 
be held hostage to the bottom line at a time when the need to know can mean the 
difference between life and death?*

PERSONAL PERSPECTIVE; QUAKE AID THAT'S KEEPING THE POOR OUT IN THE COLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GUIDO DE RIENZO, Guido De Rienzo is a staff representative for Council 36 of 
the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees helping to 
find housing for quake victims. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How does the government spell earthquake relief if you are poor and 
non-English speaking? 
</P>
<P>
 G-O-O-D L-U-C-K. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the Northridge earthquake, the availability of low- income housing 
in the San Fernando Valley was woefully short of the need. The "doubling-up" of 
families in single-family apartments was common. Worse, families constituted an 
ever-increasing share of the homeless population in the Valley. Regrettably, 
quake-relief efforts have served to underline just how intractable this housing 
shortage is -- and why the government's programs may be doomed to failure. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Housing and Urban Development administrators of the Section 
8 housing-voucher program were probably oblivious to the lack of low-income 
housing in the Valley. They may have not known that the Civil Rights Division 
of the Department of Justice recently filed a housing-discrimination suit 
against more than 3,000 landlords in the San Fernando Valley, mostly on the 
west side. 
</P>
<P>
 But the result is clear and cruel. Quake-displaced poor families of color, 
with incomes of less than $20,000, have been given a piece of paper that offers 
them new shelter in a region where there are few available housing units and 
where they are unwanted. Which may explain why, as of last week, less than 5% 
of the nearly 10,000 rent-subsidy certificates distributed by the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency had been cashed in. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, according to some of my neighbors who have received the low-income 
certificates, failure to find a landlord willing to accept the Section 8 
voucher within 60 days -- the program is voluntary -- will result in removal 
from the program. Unfortunately, as one displaced resident told me, most 
landlords "don't want those folks on welfare." Even the worst quake in modern 
L.A. history can't knock down the San Fernando Valley's "color barriers" and 
income prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have belatedly begun to recognize the problem of finding Section 8 
housing in the Valley -- fewer than 500 units, according to a list supplied by 
the Rent Stabilization Division of the city Housing Department. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA is also gradually discovering that what housing is available tends to be 
clustered in the Valley's poorer neighborhoods, reflecting the area's longtime 
housing discrimination. Channeling quake victims to these communities would be 
tantamount to reinforcing racially segregation patterns, a clear violation of 
any HUD mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 HUD would face the same dilemma if it decided to move the quake-displaced to 
available low-income housing in other parts of the city, such as in 
South-Central. Furthermore, even if it could, the agency would be relieving 
some of the pressure on the Valley landlords who have been charged with 
discrimination. The quake has thus exposed a problem the city can no longer 
avoid: the clustering of Section 8 housing. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two short-term solutions. Housing placement assistance must be 
provided by those who are issuing the vouchers. If anything, at least FEMA 
should document the persistence of discriminatory housing practices alleged by 
the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, if the use of Section 8 vouchers proves to be an unmovable barrier to 
finding housing in the Valley, the architects of the quake-relief program ought 
to consider distributing housing grants, good for 18 months, to the displaced. 
This would overcome the stigma attached to the Section 8 certificates. 
</P>
<P>
 Short of this, Los Angeles' quake-displaced poor may be indefinitely exiled to 
"temporary shelters" and "tent cities."*

IRELAND WATCH; ACCEPTABLE NOWHERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When two senior senators, a few dozen House members, an ambassador and a 
National Security Council official ask that a U.S. visa be issued to a 
foreigner, it should come as no surprise that the visa is issued. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerry Adams, head of Sinn Fein, the political partner of the Irish Republican 
Army, does not enjoy personal support at that level.He got a visa for his visit 
last week simply because political progress in Northern Ireland requires a 
maximally open political debate. 
</P>
<P>
 That much granted, nothing that Adams said during his 48-hour visit was as 
important as what we hope he heard. And what he needed to hear was that there 
is no Irish American support for any IRA program to bomb the British out of 
Northern Ireland. On that question, Irish America stands with Irish Prime 
Minister Albert Reynolds, who said after last year's Shankill Road massacre, in 
which 10 died: "Those who perpetrate such actions have absolutely no mandate 
from the people, north or south, for their vicious campaigns. Excuses such as 
have been put forward are not acceptable." 
</P>
<P>
 Unacceptable in Ireland means unacceptable in Irish America. No mandate there, 
no mandate here. If Sens. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) and Daniel Patrick 
Moynihan (D-N.Y.) did not make that point to Adams while he was here, they 
should make it to him the next time they are there. President Clinton's 
decision to grant Adams a visa was a defensible move, but it was also a bitter 
moment in British-American relations and one can only hope it will prove to be 
worth what it has cost.

PUBLIC SAFETY MUST NEVER TAKE A BACK SEAT; FEW OVERPASSES HAD BEEN RETROFITTED 
BEFORE THE QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For more than two decades state transportation engineers have been acutely 
aware of the danger of building freeways near earthquake faults. Indeed, the 
lessons learned from the extensive damage caused to freeways by the 1971 Sylmar 
earthquake and the 1989 Loma Prieta quake were the basis for an aggressive 
statewide program to retrofit elevated roads, bridges and overpasses. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, in Southern California many of those upgrades were not 
completed before Jan. 17's devastating Northridge quake. Of the 1,033 bridges 
scheduled to be retrofitted statewide, construction on only one-quarter had 
been finished. 
</P>
<P>
 Substantial structural failures occurred on five of Southern California's most 
heavily traveled thoroughfares in last month's 6.6 temblor, and some critics 
attribute most of those failures to the fact that retrofitting was not done. 
Repair of the five freeways -- the Santa Monica, the Golden State, the Antelope 
Valley, the Simi Valley and the San Diego -- is expected to cost $900 million 
and take up to a year. 
</P>
<P>
 A reason for the delay in retrofitting -- only one reason among several, but a 
significant one -- is a court battle between the California Department of 
Transportation and the union representing its engineers, according to top 
officials of that agency. The legal wrangling began in 1989, when the 
Legislature passed a bill (SB 516) giving Caltrans the authority to award 
contracts for highway design projects to private-sector engineering firms. In 
1991 the Legislature passed another bill (1219) reaffirming Caltrans' authority 
in this regard, but the program was stalled by a subsequent ruling of a 
Sacramento Superior Court judge in a challenge brought by the engineer's union. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year the Legislature again exempted private contracts for earthquake 
repair projects from the court's more general order prohibiting private 
contracting. But in the meantime, as Caltrans Director James W. van Loben Sels 
and the agency's chief engineer, James Roberts, told the Assembly 
Transportation Committee last week, the opportunity for headway on these vital 
repairs was lost. 
</P>
<P>
 It is too soon to say to what extent the litigation, or bureaucratic inertia, 
delayed work on bridges and overpasses along the Santa Monica Freeway, among 
the nation's busiest highways. Retrofitting on the parts that collapsed Jan. 17 
had been scheduled to begin this month. Now rebuilding of major stretches will 
be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, investigation is warranted in this matter. And to prevent more delay, 
Gov. Pete Wilson should expand procedures he implemented to streamline repair 
contracting to include the retrofitting work. And for its part, the engineers 
union should stop its obstructionism. Two major earthquakes in California in 
the last five years are a wake-up call like no other. 
</P>

 Los Angeles, and for that matter much of California, has grown up around a 
vast network of freeways. That system, much of it laid out between the end of 
World War II and 1970, helped to fuel what is perhaps the greatest sustained 
economic boom in the history of the nation. Repair of these roads -- to make 
them as earthquake-resistant as possible -- must be done as fast as possible.

RECHARGING THE ELECTRIC IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The decision by a number of populous states to follow California's lead in 
fostering development of electric cars gives the Clinton Administration added 
political muscle to prod U.S. auto makers to finally get serious about electric 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's vote by the Ozone Transport Commission, which represents 12 
Eastern states and the District of Columbia, makes it clear that California -- 
the home of strict emissions rules and the beginnings of an EV industry -- is 
no longer a voice in the wilderness when it comes to promoting EV technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite objections from the auto industry, the commission approved a series of 
recommendations that are close to ones already adopted by California. The 
commission recommends that its member states implement a low-emissions program 
beginning in 1996 and require the sale of cleaner cars and light trucks 
starting in 1999. The body also called for a progressive reduction in emissions 
with each model year, beginning in 1999, with a reduction of nearly 50% by 
2003; electric vehicles would meet low- or zero-emissions standards. With its 
vote, the commission formally calls on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 
to require "progressively cleaner standards" for automobile emissions. The EPA 
now has nine months to draft final rules on low-emission vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA -- and the Administration generally -- has been on the defensive 
lately with regard to clean-air rules and the potential of EV technology. The 
auto industry has mounted a strong lobbying campaign against California's 
strict emissions standards at a time when the Administration has launched a 
"partnership" with Detroit to develop cleaner vehicles (although not 
necessarily electric cars). The states represented on the commission, together 
with California, are home to slightly more than 50% of the nation's population. 
Obviously Detroit knows there is a big potential market for electric vehicles 
in these states, and that it had better get with the program.

LET'S HOPE HE'S RIGHT; FED RAISES SHORT-TERM RATES; MARKETS PLUNGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Does it make sense to raise short-term interest rates in order to keep other 
interest rates from rising? Yes, according to Federal Reserve officials. Let's 
hope they're right. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual move, the Fed made a pointed public announcement Friday that it 
is tightening credit by raising a key short-term rate for the first time in 
five years. The goal is to check inflation with a preemptive strike, maintain 
stability in long-term interest rates and sustain the economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the Fed's stunning departure from its usual nebulous, go-slow approach to 
fighting inflation succeed? The timing, speed and bold announcement of the 
increase certainly surprised the financial markets. The Dow plummeted nearly 
100 points Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement occurred within a week after Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan 
first signaled that short-term rates would rise soon, and the day after the 
typically secretive Fed Open Market Committee voted to nudge one rate a tiny 
bit. The increase -- a federal funds rate hike on overnight loans of 0.25%, to 
3.25% -- will prove tolerable if it cools inflation worries that could drive up 
long-term borrowing costs for consumers, business and governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Affordable mortgages are crucial to a housing recovery in California. For six 
months home sales have been rising nicely, thanks to both low rates and a 
bottoming in housing prices. Keeping that recovery cooking is vital, especially 
now that the Northridge earthquake is further dampening housing prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's seven-member board has long been dominated by anti-inflation hawks. 
Two such members are resigning, giving President Clinton an opportunity to fill 
the posts. If the appointments tilt the board toward a less attentive 
inflation-fighting policy, that too could drive up long-term rates. The 
President's appointments will be closely watched.

DOWNEY MCDONALD'S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * McDonald's announcement that it will build a "replica" of the historic 
Downey McDonald's while abandoning the original is a totally unacceptable and 
outrageous response to preserving a landmark (Jan. 29). 
</P>
<P>
 A phony reproduction sacrifices the historical integrity of the world's oldest 
McDonald's, a National Register landmark built in 1953 as a model for 
"self-service" dining and the last of its kind anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Would it be OK to build a local replica of Hollywood's landmark Chinese 
Theater and then demolish the original merely because the new one had a bigger 
snack bar and more parking? Certainly not. The same is true of the Downey 
McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
 This "replica" will have indoor seating and a drive-thru and be similar to 
many new "golden arch" prototypes.  
</P>
<P>
 McDonald's: Why is restoring the original stand not a viable solution? And why 
can't you see the value in retaining the last original piece of your own 
history that everyone else seems to recognize?

LLOYD BENTSEN

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It is interesting, and humorous, to see that Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen is becoming part of the U.S. contingent to browbeat Asian nations to 
open their markets more to U.S. products. He said Washington will seek "to open 
markets, not close ours" (Jan. 19). 
</P>
<P>
 This ridiculous strategy has been going on for more than 12 years, and has 
failed.  
</P>
<P>
 The answer is to close off our markets more, the same as Japan and most of the 
other Asian nations do. Especially in products where most of the deficit 
occurs, like automobiles and auto parts. This would show that our politicians 
really are serious, instead of just posturing.

 * It looks like the Clinton Adminsitration is greasing the skids for renewal 
of the "most favored nation" trade status for China regardless of its massive 
human rights and trade rights abuses, including the widespread use of slave 
labor to produce exports to the United States (Jan. 21). 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Ambassador J. Stapleton Roy at the end of December declared that he 
considers it "abnormal" to link China's trade status with its human rights 
abuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, the U.S. Department of State's annual report of human rights fails to 
complain about the 20 million Chinese in the laogai forced labor system.  
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, Bentsen announced "some progress" toward making inspections of 
some laogai forced labor facilities. This "progress" amounted to only five 
sites.  
</P>
<P>
 With such diplomatic nonchalance, the Clinton Administration looks like it 
will accept tokenism instead of full compliance with human rights practices.

DAY LABORERS IN LADERA HEIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * We are writing in response to Supervisor Yvonne B. Burke's column ("The 
Problem Up Close," Commentary, Jan. 25). We are the day laborers who wait for 
work in Ladera Heights, and we take issue with Burke on a number of points. 
</P>
<P>
 First, she stated that she has been "attempting to resolve this problem" for 
more than a year, yet we have never been approached by the supervisor or any of 
her staff. It is difficult to imagine such attempts absent our participation, 
which we believe is key to the process of reaching a viable resolution of this 
issue. A public policy "solution" that excludes a principal party seems doomed 
to failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the supervisor claims that we have not been involved in negotiations, 
yet since Burke first introduced her ordinance in October we have been actively 
involved. In fact, it was the very advocates she accuses of not working with us 
who brought us into the discussion. We have participated in several meetings, 
including meetings in which residents and representatives from Burke's office 
were present. In addition, more than two dozen of us attended the Jan. 25 Board 
of Supervisor's meeting to register our opposition to the proposed ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 As to the supervisor's accusations that we harass women and children, we are 
saddened and offended. As fathers and husbands, we have the utmost respect for 
women and children. We invite Burke and anyone else to come to the Ladera 
Heights commercial district where we wait for work and see for themselves that 
we are not the kind of people she accuses us of being. We have concrete ideas 
on how to resolve the legitimate concerns which many of us share with other 
Ladera Heights community members. We hope the supervisor is willing to listen 
to our ideas and to see us for what we are -- honest workers and family men who 
are struggling to maintain our families and our dignity.

THE QUAKE SHAKES OUT FRIENDS WITH FEET OF CLAY; RELATIONSHIPS: WHAT ARE WE TO 
MAKE OF PEOPLE WE THOUGHT WE COULD COUNT ON WHO NEVER CALLED TO SEE IF WE WERE 
OK? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET LEVER, Janet Lever is an associate professor of sociology at Cal State 
Los Angeles.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Everyone is talking about the compassion shown by strangers and neighbors in 
the aftermath of the Northridge quake. That our civil social bonds have not 
completely broken down is cause for celebration, but what happened to some 
personal bonds has left many of us disturbed. Quietly, among closest friends, 
we are talking about people we had counted on who let us down. In my friendship 
circle, everyone has somebody who just wasn't there: cousins in Northridge who 
didn't check on their elderly mother in Burbank, an aunt who didn't call to see 
what she could do for a niece forced out of her Sherman Oaks apartment, 
boyfriends who didn't call for several days -- or at all -- after the disaster. 
(Sadly, I count myself among the women who were hurt by guys we thought at 
least cared whether we lived or died.) One of my students was stunned that her 
baby's father didn't call. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, in primary relationships, obligations to loved ones are a two-way 
street. Worried out-of-state relatives asked me to help contact a man in Encino 
who never thought to use a pay phone to make a reassuring call during the week 
his phone was out of order. 
</P>
<P>
 Balancing our disappointment was the tremendous reward and comfort when 
concerned friends and family persevered through days of jammed phone lines to 
make connections. I had at least 40 calls in the first three days, and as the 
week came to a close, I'd heard from several long-lost friends. These 
reconnections were an unanticipated bonus of our calamity. But as we heard from 
those at the outer edges of our personal network, the indifference of those we 
thought were closer made the hurt worse. 
</P>
<P>
 So what do we do now? Is it an over-reaction to write off family, friends and 
lovers who flunked God's earthquake test? If we break off ties, it's our loss, 
too, and that kind of loss isn't covered by earthquake insurance. If we try to 
maintain ties, how do we forgive and forget? Or will we just end up lowering 
our expectations of that person and our relationship?  
</P>
<P>
 In the face of real physical suffering and loss, these disappointments may 
seem trivial. But for those of us who count some meaningful relationships among 
the treasures lost or damaged forever in the earthquake, maybe there's comfort 
in knowing that we're not alone.

PERSPECTIVE ON BOSNIA; A FORCED PEACE IS WORTH TRYING; A TRULY HUMANITARIAN 
POLICY WOULD BE FOR THE WEST TO BRING AN END TO THE FIGHTING, EVEN IF IT IS AN 
UNJUST END. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE KENNEY, George Kenney, a consultant to the Carnegie Endowment for 
International Peace, was the State Department's Yugoslav desk officer from 
February to August, 1992, when he resigned in protest of U.S. policy. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Paris recently told Washington that Western efforts to end the war in 
Bosnia weren't working, and weren't going to work as currently structured, the 
French were right. The French worry that an indefinite prolongation of the war 
-- five, 10 years or more -- will seriously debilitate European security. And, 
they point out, our "humanitarian aid" merely helps the combatants. A truly 
humanitarian policy would be for the West to try to bring an end to the 
fighting, even if that means an unjust end. 
</P>
<P>
 The international community must try something new. Instead of rebuffing Paris 
out of hand, Secretary of State Warren Christopher now has an opportunity for 
serious, constructive dialogue. If he does not seize it, he risks a grave 
rupture in U.S.-European security relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's take a fresh look at the situation: 
</P>
<P>
 The net effect of international relief operations in Bosnia is to slowly 
strengthen the Bosnian Muslim army. We are kidding ourselves when we talk about 
humanitarian aid. Everything we send either goes directly to the army or 
substitutes for goods the army would take from civilians anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's not kid ourselves either about the nature of the Bosnian government. It 
used to be a moderate, inclusive regime that enjoyed substantial support from 
the Bosnian Croat and Serb communities. Bosnian Croats and Serbs held key 
positions. Over the past year, however, under the pressures of the war, it 
became a 95% Muslim entity. That is not good, it is not something the Muslims 
themselves wanted, but it happened. Today, Sarajevo is the capital, as the 
Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic told me recently, of a Muslim state. It 
is only to the outside world that the Bosnian government maintains the fiction 
of its "multiethnic" character, for the obvious reason that a multiethnic state 
is more likely to get international aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past several months, the Bosnian Muslim army has made gains, through 
vicious fighting, against Croatian forces in central and south-central Bosnia. 
Croatian villagers in areas of Bosnian army control are scared, with reason. 
Muslim atrocities occur more frequently. The question forces itself on the 
West: Do we support Muslim politics of revenge? 
</P>
<P>
 The logic behind the Bosnian assault is twofold: Remove unreliable, potential 
fifth-column Croatians, and take from them a swath of land down to the coast, 
that is, the access to the sea promised in the Geneva talks, but which the 
Bosnians believe they will not get unless they take it for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Hard-line Muslim military commanders, a majority in the army, would go 
further, to roll back Serbian and Croatian forces from all the territory of the 
former Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 It was one thing for the international community to seek to help the side (the 
Muslims) that suffered disproportionately from aggression, so long as the 
Muslims were losing. But our support for the Muslims finally tilted the local 
balance in their favor. The danger, the French point out, is that our support 
encourages the Muslims to cross some invisible threshold that will bring in 
Croatian and Serbian forces from outside. At that point, Muslims will lose more 
than they have already lost. 
</P>
<P>
 The international community passed up every opportunity to restore Bosnia as a 
multiethnic state. The damage has already been done of allowing an example of 
aggression to succeed. The best we could hope for is to put an end to the 
fighting, an unjust armistice, that would spare the civilian population further 
suffering and keep the conflict from spreading through the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
 The international community faces three choices: Pull out of Bosnia; keep 
muddling on, or attempt to use force to bring about territorial division and an 
end to the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulling out would be a catastrophe. Fighting would escalate and the Muslims 
would lose. Chances are 50-50 that misguided American interventionists, who 
still think the Bosnian government is multiethnic, would push the U.S. 
government into arming the Muslims. Any such arming, overt or covert, would 
bring into the conflict for the first time a set of outside powers backing 
different favorites. It is World War I again. 
</P>
<P>
 Withdrawal would also tell the rest of the Balkans something they don't need 
to hear: The way to settle your political differences is to fight it out. The 
last man standing wins. Just because the entire peninsula hasn't blown up yet 
doesn't mean it won't. 
</P>
<P>
 If we want a Balkan domino effect, this is how to get it. Muddling on only 
postpones the day of reckoning. The war will go on. Meanwhile, our 
"humanitarian aid" operations cost a lot of money -- perhaps between $3 billion 
and $4 billion. For what? We are dreaming if we think we have helped set the 
stage for a peacefully negotiated settlement in this century. 
</P>
<P>
 So forcing a settlement on all the parties starts to look like it's not such a 
bad idea. Exactly how to do that would be difficult to work out. Honestly, it 
may not prove possible, but it's worth a try. All the French are saying is, 
let's sit down and have a serious look at the mess we're in. Washington should 
cooperate.

WHY WAS THERE VIRTUALLY NO LOOTING AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David D.. Dotson, David D. Dotson is former assistant chief of the Los 
Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the weeks since Los Angeles re-earned its country-music name, "Shakytown," 
one statistic has pleasantly surprised many, including the police. Looting has 
been virtually ab sent in the wake of the Northridge earthquake. Official Los 
Angeles Police Department stats for such arrests remain fewer than 10. 
</P>
<P>
 How can this be? Don't all the scenarios for the Big One include scenes of 
shaken citizens defending themselves against bands of looters when the police 
are unable to respond? 
</P>
<P>
 One obvious reason for the overwhelmingly lawful citizen reaction to the quake 
was the rapid and aggressive governmental response. In addition to those 
directly dealing with the physical trauma and property damage, large 
contingents of police, sheriff's deputies, highway patrol and National Guard 
were quickly deployed and kept on duty until reasonable control was 
established. One captain in the San Fernando Valley, for example, reports that 
his nine radio-car patrol force was supplemented by 25 two-per- son units drawn 
from the LAPD, 60 deputy sheriffs assigned to an anti-looting task force and a 
large number of Guardsmen on duty at emergency shelters. Officers who live in 
the most severely affected quake areas report an almost constant presence of 
on-duty law en- forcement in their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 One high-ranking police official believes that early public statements by 
Mayor Richard Riordan and Chief of Police Willie L. Williams, plus the 
imposition of a curfew, also sent a clear message that looting would not be 
tolerated. The relatively smooth functioning of the city's emergency-management 
structure helped to create a feeling that government was in control and had the 
capability to stop lawbreakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Other factors narrowed the opportunity to loot. Business owners and operators 
were at their stores soon after the initial tremor, cleaning up broken glass, 
restacking shelves or boarding up windows. By nightfall, their businesses were 
generally secured. Second, most residents displaced by the quake stayed within 
sight of their homes or apartments. Even those who moved to shelters spent 
considerable time at their damaged residences. 
</P>
<P>
 Plausible as these explanations are, something deeper seemed to have spawned a 
public morality that so broadly rejected capitalizing on the misfortune of 
others. When the extent of the horror became known, some officers reported, 
residents tended to turn inward to deal with personal survival issues. One 
young captain quipped: "The bad guys were as 'rattled' as the good people." All 
agreed, however, that a more powerful motivation than mere self-interest was at 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 For Angelenos, the quake was a shared experience, an experience largely 
unaffected by economic status, age, race or ethnicity, gender, occupation, or 
the myriad other classifications that serve to separate us. Fear, apprehension, 
uncertainty about the future, concern for loved ones, profound personal and 
material loss -- all were unifying forces. As one Valley captain put it, "Not 
all of the walls that came down on Jan. 17 were made of wood or masonry." 
Shared adversity, at least temporarily, become a persuasive advocate for the 
value of mutual respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Cops, as is the case with most other Los Angelenos, have lately become adept 
at searching for silver linings. Every officer I talked with described some 
positive omen he or she discovered while coping with the earthquake's 
aftermath. Some hoped the LAPD would adopt some of the alternative work 
schedules -- longer hours, fewer days -- that have appeared effective since the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 One explanation of the low post-quake crime rate has immediate implications 
for the future of policing. The northwest San Fernando Valley has a reputation 
for effective police-community involvement. It is where Neighborhood Watch 
began in Los Angeles, probably because it was where the program founder, then 
Chief of Police Ed Davis, lived. The program's structure, according to one 
captain, served as a natural vehicle for the initial quake-recovery efforts. 
Block captains reportedly provided organization, leadership and information to 
their neighbors in the hours after the quake. In one instance, citizens stood 
guard over a police-community sponsored computer training facility for teens 
that had lost its windows until police could respond. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, there are lessons to be learned from the virtual absence of 
quake-inspired looting. City officials who can provide leadership for 
earthquake recovery can do the same in other areas of responsibility.  
</P>
<P>
 Public and private agencies that have combined forces to overcome the quake's 
effects can address other interjurisdictional problems. And a citizenry that 
recognizes the common threat of a chilling earthquake can extend that 
recognition to the equally serious threats posed by violent crime and other 
social illnesses.*

NAVAJOS FIND INSPIRATION AT MISSION SCHOOL; NEW MEXICO: NO ONE HAS DROPPED OUT 
OF ST. BONAVENTURE, AND 22 OF ITS 31 GRADUATES HAVE GONE ON TO COLLEGE. MYSTERY 
WRITER TONY HILLERMAN DEDICATED HIS NEW BOOK TO THE SMALL INSTITUTION.

<P>
 The sight of a shivering child standing naked on the dirt floor of a Navajo 
hogan inspired a missionary priest to create an educational success story in 
Indian Country, the St. Bonaventure mission school. 
</P>
<P>
 Set against red bluffs near the Continental Divide off Interstate 40, the 
school has no dropouts and sends nearly all its seniors to college. 
</P>
<P>
 When the bewhiskered, Brooklyn-born Rev. Douglas McNeill arrived here as a 
32-year-old Roman Catholic missionary in 1974, the school wasn't even a twinkle 
in his jade-green eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the more he learned about Navajos, he said, the more he knew they would 
succeed -- and thus, so would a school -- and the more he knew they needed one. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state can boast that in this little spot, something beautiful and 
long-lasting is going on for our Native American people," McNeill said. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea for the Catholic school evolved from various encounters, he said, 
including visits in 1977-78 to rural Navajo homes, many of which lacked water 
or electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 McNeill said he was particularly troubled by what he found in one home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a cold day, and I went into this house with a dirt floor, and this 
little kid had no clothes on and that little kid was freezing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was seeming to me that for the young, this wasn't the best of all worlds." 
</P>
<P>
 He started a mission preschool in 1980 with guidance from a Gallup, N.M., Head 
Start coordinator, giving youngsters breakfast, lunch and early education. A 
few years later, he expanded the school through the high school grades. 
</P>
<P>
 The 300-student school, which is 90% Navajo, graduated its fifth class of 
seniors last spring. All but nine of its 31 graduates in those five years have 
gone to college. Eight of the school's nine current seniors plan on college, 
and there are no dropouts, McNeill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Platero, who heads a federal education program for the tribe in Window 
Rock, Ariz., said that's in contrast to other experiences. Platero said a 
four-year study in the mid-1980s showed a 31% dropout rate among 4,742 Navajos 
tracked from the ninth through 12th grades. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Bonaventure is fully accredited. It's also praised by tribal education 
officials and recently received additional recognition in the latest book by 
New Mexico mystery writer Tony Hillerman, who sets his novels in Navajo 
country. The murder in Hillerman's "Sacred Clowns" occurs at the school, and 
the book is dedicated to McNeill and his staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just makes you feel good to be around people like the gang at that school, 
who are dedicating a big chunk of their lives to helping other people," 
Hillerman said. 
</P>
<P>
 McNeill said the book dedication is bringing a steady stream of modest 
contributions from Hillerman readers nationwide, which eventually could help 
build a new campus nearby, complete with gymnasium. The current school has no 
sports facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite that lack, there is a waiting list to enroll at St. Bonaventure, known 
formally as Kateri Tekakwitha Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominic Pedro, 16, a Laguna Pueblo Indian in his junior year at the school, 
said he wishes it had a baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I like basketball and football because my cousins are involved," he said. 
"I feel a little left out." 
</P>
<P>
 He could have attended Crownpoint High School near his home, but prefers St. 
Bonaventure "because you get to learn more," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He plans to attend college to become a medical technician. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven lay missionaries teach here, many of them young men from Notre Dame 
University on their first assignments, full of "commitment and creativity and 
patience," McNeill said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school features small classes and an acceptance of Navajo culture -- 
showing students "it's good to be Navajo, because sometimes life doesn't always 
tell them that," McNeill said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are less students than in public school," Pedro said. "They (teachers) 
get to help you more." 
</P>
<P>
 Terri Dakia, 16, a Navajo on the school's student council and honor society, 
said: "The work here is more challenging. It keeps me on my toes." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Pedro, Dakia probably would have attended Crownpoint High 25 miles north 
of here if she had opted for public education. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I would've enjoyed myself over there," said Dakia, who wants to 
study psychology in college. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's valedictorian, Tonya Anderson, 19, is now at New Mexico Junior 
College in Hobbs, taking a premedical course and planning to transfer to the 
University of New Mexico or Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 For her, a mission school day included a 40-mile round-trip bus ride, often 
beginning before sunrise and ending after sunset. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got on the bus at 6:30, and it was close to 5 when I got home," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 McNeill said a Navajo woman once told him how a public school counselor 
suggested her son not bother applying to college because he would only be 
disappointed -- and the boy followed that advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remembered thinking the counselor believed she was doing the right thing 
and didn't realize she was crushing his whole future," he said.

ANDRUS UNDER FIRE FOR BACKING BOMB RANGE; IDAHO: DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR, A FORMER 
INTERIOR SECRETARY, FINDS HIMSELF ON OTHER SIDE IN A NASTY DISPUTE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL WEST, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If they ever build a Hall of Fame for environmentalists, Idaho Gov. Cecil D. 
Andrus would be a shoo-in. 
</P>
<P>
 He pioneered the Green era in modern politics in 1970, not long after the 
initial Earth Day, by becoming the first governor elected on an environmental 
ticket. He was a national hero to conservationists as Interior secretary during 
Jimmy Carter's presidency, when the national park system doubled in size and 
the amount of protected wilderness tripled. 
</P>
<P>
 But these days Andrus finds himself on the other side in a nasty dispute that, 
on a small scale, raises the same question bedeviling the Clinton 
Administration over such issues as timber cutting in the Pacific Northwest: Are 
there limits to conservation when economic development is at stake? 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, few American politicians are better suited to navigating the 
perilous path between protecting ecosystems and preserving jobs than "Cece" 
Andrus. 
</P>
<P>
 A popular Democrat in a predominantly Republican state, he rose to the 
governor's office by opposing a plan to mine the White Clouds mountains. Andrus 
argued then that a sound environment and a growing economy could exist side by 
side, and 23 years later, as he begins the final year of his fourth, and he 
says last, term as governor, he would seem to have proved his point. 
</P>
<P>
 This booming state on the western slope of the Rockies led the nation in job 
growth in 1992. Tourism is the state's third-leading industry and the Snake 
River Valley is fast becoming one of the country's leading high-tech centers. 
</P>
<P>
 The promise of low crime rates, relatively cheap housing, breathtaking scenery 
and abundant outdoor recreation -- local boosters like to say that you can play 
golf in the morning and go skiing the same afternoon -- have lured urban 
refugees from both coasts. They made Idaho the second-fastest-growing state in 
the nation last year, although with 1.1 million people scattered across an area 
larger than New England, there is room to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 Presiding over it all, as Sportsman-in-Chief, is the 62-year-old governor, who 
once worked as a lumberjack before entering politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have participated in some of the destruction that I abhor now," said 
Andrus, who looks like he still could take down a Ponderosa pine without 
working up a sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the governor has been battling the federal government over its 
plans to store nuclear waste in Idaho. He succeeded in keeping large, 
coal-burning power plants out of the state when they were the rage elsewhere in 
the Rockies. And he hasn't been afraid to take on the National Rifle Assn., 
which he once termed "the gun nuts of the world," even though Idaho has the 
second-highest percentage of hunters of any state. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a practicing environmentalist," Andrus explained in an interview in his 
sprawling, marble-columned Statehouse office, where a gold-plated rifle and a 
personal computer are both on display. "I'm not a dreamer with a flower in my 
teeth. I'm out there with a fly rod in my hands. I've got a little Brittany 
bird dog that's just super with hunting quail and chukar and pheasants. And I 
hunt elk and I ride horses in the back country." 
</P>
<P>
 All of which makes many fellow Idahoans wonder why Andrus is so stubbornly 
pushing an Air Force plan to put a 25,000-acre training range in pristine 
desert canyon land in the southwestern corner of the state, especially now that 
the Cold War has ended and the need for new military facilities seems remote. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel betrayed," said Nancy Westcott, a Boise housewife, in one of the 
milder comments one is likely to hear from training-range opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrus insists that, without the proposed range, the Air Force is likely to 
eliminate its nearby air base at Mountain Home, Idaho, when the next round of 
base closings begins in 1995. That, he adds, would mean a loss of thousands of 
jobs and hundreds of millions of dollars to Idaho's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our state's largest employer. So we've got to have a training range," 
said Andrus, who maintains that damage to the land will be minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists contend that the range, which would be "bombed" with 
non-explosive flares, dummy ordnance and aluminum chaff, would restrict hunting 
and recreation over a large area, threaten a large herd of bighorn sheep and 
possibly damage archeological sites that include Indian ruins and petroglyphs. 
They also point out that an existing bombing range is only 20 minutes' flying 
time away, in northern Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 For months, the controversy has been the talk of the capital city of Boise, a 
town of 150,000 that sits at the foot of snowcapped hills. There have been TV 
and radio commercials, billboards protesting the range, and heavy coverage by 
the local media. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental leaders, mindful of the governor's record of achievement, speak 
more in sorrow than in anger of his determination to see the range created. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he's on our side there's nobody like him. When he's against us, it's a 
big problem because he's so skillful," said Pat Ford of the Idaho Conservation 
League. "Conservationists obviously want people like Andrus to be on their side 
on every issue. But that hasn't happened, and it never will." 
</P>
<P>
 Even as he fights to "bomb" the Owyhee desert, Andrus is waging his last, and 
most romantic, campaign of all -- to save the oceangoing Snake River salmon 
from extinction. His national crusade, which he likens to efforts to protect 
the bald eagle, pits him against influential House Speaker Thomas S. Foley, 
whose eastern Washington district is home to a series of dams where many of the 
young Idaho salmon perish on their journey of nearly 1,000 miles to the 
Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the cheap electricity generated by those dams that powers aluminum 
factories, which are the major private employers in Foley's district. Andrus 
contends the salmon could be saved if water were allowed to flow more swiftly 
through the dams during the migration period -- at a cost of millions of 
dollars in higher electric power rates and possible economic harm to the 
river-port cities downstream.

ONE CREEK AT A TIME, OREGON IS RESTORING SALMON HABITAT; ENVIRONMENT: THE 
AMERICAN FISHERIES SOCIETY HAS IDENTIFIED 213 WEST COAST RUNS OF SALMON, 
STEELHEAD AND SEA RUN CUTTHROAT TROUT THAT ARE IN DANGER OF EXTINCTION.

<P>
 Walking along the South Fork of Little Butte Creek, fish biologist Jerry Vogt 
didn't have to look far to find evidence of how man has made it tough for 
salmon to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Mounds of gravel along the creek bank showed where bulldozers plowed out the 
channel after the devastating flood of 1964, turning the Rogue River tributary 
into more of a gutter than a spawning bed for coho salmon. 
</P>
<P>
 "People like things neat and tidy and clean. Fish and wildlife like things 
messy," said Vogt, who works for the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife in 
White City. 
</P>
<P>
 One creek at a time, Vogt and others are messing things up. 
</P>
<P>
 They are under the gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Three runs of Pacific salmon already have been protected under the Endangered 
Species Act and more are on the way. Environmentalists petitioned to protect 
coho salmon runs; they plan to file a petition to protect winter steelhead 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Fisheries Society has identified 213 West Coast runs of salmon, 
steelhead and sea run cutthroat trout that are in danger of extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife blames the coho's predicament on a 
lack of food in the ocean, where salmon grow to be adults. The department has 
warned commercial salmon fishermen they probably won't be able to troll for 
coho next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless there's a last-minute miracle, it's harder and harder to find any 
optimism," said Bernie Bohn, harvest manager for the department. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, government agencies have dealt with declining salmon runs by 
cutting back on fishing and boosting production from hatcheries. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just rearranging deck chairs on the Titanic," said Glen Spain of the 
Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Assn., which represents commercial 
fishermen. "The habitat issue is the real issue. I'm real concerned that we are 
not pro-active on habitat protection." 
</P>
<P>
 "The salmon is the preeminent indicator species, because it starts at the top 
of the watershed, goes all through the watershed, into the estuaries and out to 
the ocean and returns again," Spain said. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the salmon go down, it's a clear warning bell that we have destroyed most 
of the integrity of our watersheds." 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon spawn in Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon and California. Until now, 
most of the effort to boost declining runs has focused on the series of dams on 
the Columbia and Snake rivers, which are blamed for killing millions of young 
fish each year as they migrate. The Northwest's first endangered species 
listing of a salmon run was the Snake River sockeye. 
</P>
<P>
 More attention is being paid now to restoring habitat that has been damaged by 
heavy logging, flood control, cattle grazing and urban development. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's proposal for lifting the injunctions that have 
stopped logging in northern spotted owl habitat includes $72 million for 
assessing, protecting and restoring salmon habitat in national forests. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognizing that federal lands alone won't support the restoration of salmon 
runs and other wildlife, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is encouraging big 
timber companies to develop habitat conservation plans to avoid new endangered 
species listings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The list gets longer and longer all the time and the resources we have to 
deal with it don't keep up with it," said Mollie Beattie, director of the Fish 
and Wildlife Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Rivers Council has estimated that it will cost $350 million to 
restore salmon habitat just on federal lands on the west side of the Cascade 
Range. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no big fix. It depends on lots of little fixes, such as the one on 
the South Fork of Little Butte Creek, which runs out of the Rogue River 
National Forest in the Cascade Range and connects with its North Fork before 
emptying into the Rogue River five miles north of Medford. 
</P>
<P>
 On the edge of the national forest, Vogt and a group of volunteers re-created 
a little side channel, where juvenile coho can escape the fast water of the 
creek, hide from predators and find food. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulldozers that dug out the creek bed after the 1964 flood robbed the 
channel of its water. So Vogt and the volunteers cut in a culvert and dug a 
meandering ditch through the flood plain. It's full of logs and root wads and 
alder sticks clipped off by beavers. 
</P>
<P>
 The remnants of the coho run that survive will spawn this winter in the creek. 
Vogt hopes to see the side channel full of young fish this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "This creek is still in good enough shape that we can still get some benefit," 
said Vogt. "If we can work our way downstream, we can extend the range of 
usable habitat in the stream."

OUTSPOKEN DENVER RADIO TALK SHOW HOST ALIENATES BLACK ESTABLISHMENT; LIFESTYLE: 
KEN HAMBLIN TAKES PRIDE IN SAYING THINGS "THAT A WHITE PERSON COULDN'T GET AWAY 
WITH." NATIONAL BLACK CAUCUS THREATENED TO BOYCOTT THE CITY IF HE DIDN'T TONE 
DOWN HIS REMARKS AND DEMANDED THAT THE DENVER POST CANCEL HIS COLUMN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ken Hamblin refers to Denver's black community as "Darktown." On his talk 
show, he rails against quotas, welfare dependency, illegitimate pregnancies and 
the "blame whitey" syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 If this sounds like your typical radio rabble-rouser, think again: Hamblin is 
black. And though ostracized by his community and vilified by black leaders, he 
is determined to speak out. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can motivate one black or Hispanic kid to say . . . 'I'm going to show 
him all Hispanics and blacks aren't that way,' then it's worth it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've tried it all -- more welfare, lowering standards. I would like, just 
once, for these kids to say: '. . . make it harder.' " 
</P>
<P>
 His forums are his talk show on radio station KNUS -- his colleagues call him 
"The Black Avenger" -- and a twice-weekly column in the Denver Post. 
</P>
<P>
 Both have drawn attention -- good and bad. The idea, he told the New York 
Times, was to say things "that a white person couldn't get away with." 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to know why 60% of black babies are born out of wedlock. Is that the 
fault of white people? I want to know why so many black kids can't speak proper 
English. I want to know why black people can't pass a civil service 
examination. The excuse is that it's culturally biased. Well, I'd like to know 
what could possibly be culturally biased on a test for a firefighter." 
</P>
<P>
 Now 53, he has been on the air for 11 years; at first, his was a pleasant, 
liberal, unaccented voice that gave no clue he was black. 
</P>
<P>
 But gradually, Hamblin -- a successful businessman who owns his own plane, a 
boat, a fine home and several sandwich restaurants -- became more strident. 
</P>
<P>
 In so doing, he earned fans, and enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, during a meeting in Denver, the National Black Caucus vowed to 
complain to the Federal Communications Commission about Hamblin's "racial 
epithets" and threatened a convention boycott of Denver if his remarks are not 
toned down. It urged the Post to drop Hamblin's column. 
</P>
<P>
 The caucus criticized Hamblin's references to "Darktown," and to those who 
live there as "Darktown dwellers," and "promoters of violence." California 
State Rep. Diane Watson complained that Hamblin's description of caucus members 
as "spooks" exceeded the bounds of protected free speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamblin retorted that free speech "is something dark little people like you 
(the caucus) could never understand. Dark, because your hearts are dark." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamblin said the caucus should listen to his message: "There is no room for 
the black parasite or for the Hispanic parasite. . . . We must become 
competitive. . . . We can't blame white people." 
</P>
<P>
 The Post, however, responded to the caucus' complaint by announcing his column 
would be edited more closely. 
</P>
<P>
 Editorial Page Editor Chuck Green said Hamblin has become "increasingly 
acerbic and increasingly strident," and has "accelerated his use of words that 
infuriate the black political Establishment and many black citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 "By eliminating the detracting slurs, his message might well take on greater 
clarity," Green said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in January, Hamblin was suspended from KNUS for three days and his 
Denver Post column was dropped for two weeks after he was charged with 
misdemeanor harassment. A KNUS co-worker accused him of pushing her against a 
desk and simulating sex at a New Year's Eve party. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamblin denies he did anything improper, and there is no indication that the 
suspensions will tame his tongue. 
</P>
<P>
 The son of a New York City police officer, Hamblin grew up in the 
Bedford-Stuyvesant area of Brooklyn. He attended Brooklyn College for 10 months 
after a four-year hitch in the Army, then joined a Congress of Racial Equality 
voter registration group in 1960. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been chased by KKK members in Greensboro, N.C., and in Montauk. I was in 
a car not just with black brothers, but with white guys and white women," he 
said. "And we were all the enemy." 
</P>
<P>
 "And when I speak to groups with African brothers who now have foreign names 
and foreign clothing, I remember those people with names like Schwerner, 
Chaney, Goodman, and I remember Emmett Till. I lived it. And when I saw 'Eyes 
on the Prize' on PBS, I cried." 
</P>
<P>
 He has no time for what he calls "The Soul Patrol," black community members 
who dictate politically correct black fashion and street talk. 
</P>
<P>
 And he is unwaveringly critical of Denver Mayor Wellington Webb and other 
members of the black Establishment. He accuses them of guiding blacks into 
government dependency, a morass of broken families and unwed mothers, and a 
victim-entitlement mentality. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Denver's most outspoken black man is shunned, no longer welcome 
at parties and gatherings. "It's heartbreaking," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he has his supporters. After the National Black Caucus attacked Hamblin, 
about 500 people called KNUS to express their support for him. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rocky Mountain News, Denver's other major daily newspaper, defended 
Hamblin's right to state his opinions: "Clearly Hamblin represents a minority 
opinion within the minority community, but so what? Cannot the majority of 
black lawmakers withstand the occasional rough-edged critic?" 
</P>
<P>
 And Mike Rosen, a conservative talk show host on KOA and a contributing 
columnist to the Post, also rose to Hamblin's defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hamblin has caught their (black leaders') attention because he threatens 
their authority. If they don't crush him now, other articulate, independently 
thinking blacks may do the same."

 War in Bosnia was a long way off for Betty Turulja until the evening news 
showed her own brother lying in a pool of blood, wounded among a pile of 
corpses in a Sarajevo bread line. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was it," said Turulja, a Bosnian refugee from an earlier generation. "I 
got on a plane, determined to bring out my family." 
</P>
<P>
 Her brother is still in Sarajevo, but she brought home her sister, another 
brother, a niece and a nephew, getting them safely through barrages of bullets 
and bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Seattle, her husband, Mohammed, got visas for his own nieces and 
nephews. Together, the Turuljas have brought out 14 Bosnians, all on family 
reunification visas. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many more people are still there, desperate and dying," Betty Turulja 
said, stabbing a finger at the tattered list of official phone numbers she 
calls daily to demand action. "We must stop this war." 
</P>
<P>
 In March, she traveled to the Bosnia-Croatia border, where she befriended a 
group of Bosnian soldiers who smuggled her sister and two daughters out of 
Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, she tracked down her brother, Resad Hadzimesic, 53, who had 
been imprisoned and tortured. His wife stayed in Zenica with their 3-year-old 
daughter to care for her blind mother. 
</P>
<P>
 Now she wants to return for her other brother, Dzemil, and also Resad's wife 
and daughter. "I can't bear thinking about another winter," she said. "It is 
unbelievable that this has to go on." 
</P>
<P>
 Mohammed Turulja, a retired clothier, brought his family to Seattle in 1957. 
The Nazis had killed his brother, and he said Serbs put 145,000 Bosnian Muslims 
to death between 1941 and 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows there are other sides to the complex situation, but he thinks few 
Americans are paying attention for fear of seeing modern genocide that might 
force them to get involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are saying, 'Hurry up and finish so we don't have to watch,' " 
Mohammed Turulja said. "But I think the whole world misjudged the Bosnian 
nation." 
</P>
<P>
 The Turuljas' 30-year-old son, Dean, nearly went to Bosnia to fight, but 
decided to stay home and stir up support for ending the war. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen my parents give everything to this community," he said. "They've 
taken care of people, sent food and supplies to refugees, raised money with 
speeches." 
</P>
<P>
 Like his father, he decried what he called a double standard among most 
Americans who speak about human rights but do little to help. "They don't want 
to know," he said.

1812 AMERICAN FLAG HEADED HOME FROM SCOTLAND TO FT. NIAGARA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A giant American flag carried off by British troops during the War of 1812 is 
being returned to the fort where it once flew. 
</P>
<P>
 Old Ft.Niagara, now a historic site along the Niagara River 40 miles north of 
Buffalo, will buy the tattered flag for $150,000 from the Scottish family that 
has owned it since the early 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-by-30-foot wool and linen flag has 15 stripes and 14 stars. It is one 
of the 20 oldest American flags in existence, said Brian Dunnigan, executive 
director of the fort. 
</P>
<P>
 British troops captured Fort Niagara on Dec. 19, 1813, killing 65 American 
troops and taking 344 prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 King George IV gave the flag to Sir Gordon Drummond, a general who commanded 
British troops in the Niagara River region. Since then, the flag has been on 
display at the Drummond family castle in Megginch, Scotland. 
</P>
<P>
 Fort officials learned the flag's whereabouts in the mid-1980s, and curator 
Dennis Farmer said the Drummonds "felt very strongly this is where the flag 
belongs." It is expected to be returned to the United States in the spring.

EDUCATION MUST BE VITAL ROUTE IN SUPERHIGHWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The editorial, "Tricky Pit Stop on Information Highway," (Jan. 23) on the 
need for the coming information superhighway to have public access is an 
important point that has not been strongly articulated up to now. But, in 
considering funding for the superhighway, attention needs to be paid to more 
than the hardware and access issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding of the communication infrastructure should not be seen as something 
totally separate from the information which will go over the highway. In the 
case of educational uses of the new technological delivery systems, it's not 
enough to run the wires or other transmission systems into schools and 
colleges. Educational institutions do not have the funds required for 
production of high quality media-based educational programming, and there are 
currently few companies venturing into the production of educational products 
for the new delivery systems. 
</P>
<P>
 At Coastline Community College, we have been using educational television to 
deliver college credit courses to adult students, using both broadcast and 
cable television. The courses are complete instructional packages that include 
26 half-hour television programs, textbooks, study guides and testing 
materials. To produce a course that meets technical and academic requirements 
and is effective at teaching "distance" students requires about two years of 
production time and costs anywhere from $1 (million) to $3 million. The courses 
can reach thousands of students, locally as well as at other colleges around 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Telecourses are effective instruction and are being seen, along with other 
media-based distance education, as a way of dealing with the increasing number 
of people needing higher education without requiring more campus construction, 
which the state can currently ill afford. Yet there is little state or federal 
monies for the production of telecourses. 
</P>
<P>
 It won't do our schools and colleges much good to be linked into the new 
information superhighway if the only things on the highway are entertainment 
and shopping services. As a society, we have paid teachers to teach in 
classrooms. We need to consider ways to pay for the creation of the educational 
services and products for the new superhighway if we are to truly realize the 
potential of the infrastructure investment and solve some of our pressing 
social problems.

NIXON'S PAST SHOULD NOT BE FORGOTTEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I read with great interest your editorial "Make it a Real Gem," regarding 
the development of the Center for Peace and Freedom as an offshoot of the 
Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
 It was suggested that there will be critics who will see this as another move 
to "rehabilitate the reputation of the fallen president.Whatever shadows remain 
from the Watergate era, the Nixon presidency is taking on a far more complex 
character" with the passage of time, and that "old grudges have subsided." 
</P>
<P>
 This representation of Richard Nixon's arrogant and deliberate betrayal of the 
public trust, which was revealed in the discovery of the Watergate conspiracy 
and provoked his resignation to avoid impeachment after appointing a successor 
who agreed to pardon him, exemplifies the degree of success his efforts to 
rewrite history have achieved. You characterize his Administration as 
"pragmatic," not criminal, and label condemnation of his perfidy "old grudges." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as with the Holocaust, we must not forget, as he who does not know 
history is doomed to repeat it.

BAR TOLLWAY; LEAVE CANYON TO WILDLIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I read with disbelief your recent news story about the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service's shortsighted opinion about the impact of the toll road on 
wildlife ("Tollway No Threat to Birds, New Report Says," Feb. 1). 
</P>
<P>
 The San Joaquin Hills toll road should not be built through Laguna Canyon so 
the area can best recover from the recent fires.Hundreds of wildlife species 
call this place home, including threatened species like coastal cactus wrens, 
California gnatcatchers, horned lizards and orange-throated whiptail lizards, 
along with yellow-rumped warblers, red-tailed hawks, mule deer, cottontail 
rabbits and a myriad of others. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Pulitzer Prize-winning writer/biologist E.O. Wilson, in the next 
three decades, fully a fifth of the Earth's species could vanish forever. For 
example, in recent decades, populations of migratory songbirds in the 
mid-Atlantic United States have dropped 50%. And about one-fifth of the world's 
freshwater-fish species are extinct or seriously threatened. The main culprit 
is habitat destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Protecting the world's species starts in places like Laguna Canyon, with birds 
like the gnatcatcher. It's vital that we not further fragment the habitat that 
remains. Restoration of habitat is not the answer; it simply doesn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 These animals deserve to live, for their own sakes, as well as for the 
richness they've brought to our lives for millennia. Wilson argues that nature 
soothes both body and soul. He argues further that species' extinction 
threatens our human spirit, Clearly, such valuable contributors should be 
protected.

WETLANDS FUTURE SHOULD BE ON BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I spoke at the public hearing, and listened to many others do likewise, 
about the Bolsa Chica EIR (environmental impact report). As a 26-year resident, 
I am now weary of the actions by the city to obstruct the rights of a private 
property owner to use property, which is not even in Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 What is sure to follow is a continuing use of city funds, to obstruct, and 
surely to defend, when the round of probable litigation ensues. But at the 
root, it is all about money and power. I heard objection after objection. 
</P>
<P>
 Our descendants truly deserve for us to leave to them the best environment we 
can, and can afford, as well as homes to live in, parks, open space, sports 
fields, and other public and private resources and infrastructure. Not one 
group I heard objecting stated how they would effect an environmental 
improvement/restoration of the former saltwater wetlands.  
</P>
<P>
 Let's get practical now, since no progress is being made. Let's put an item on 
the ballot, once and for all, whether the residents of Huntington Beach want to 
pay additional taxes, to buy the Koll property, in unincorporated Orange 
County, annex it, and to then restore and maintain the degraded wetlands. My 
own estimate is this could possibly be done for a onetime outlay of about 
$10,000 by each Huntington Beach household of three people. Start negotiating 
price and get businesslike about the whole matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Being even more practical, we know most households couldn't possibly afford a 
onetime outlay of $10,000 to purchase and restore the property. 
</P>
<P>
 So who has a plan? 
</P>
<P>
 The only plan that is fiscally possible is that of Koll Real Estate Group. Cut 
your best deal with the county on developer fees. Do this so my descendants 
have a nice, restored coastal wetlands, and homes to live in. The alternative 
is years of litigation, at residents' expense. 
</P>
<P>
 Put the cost and the issue on the ballot for Huntington Beach to decide.

COUNCIL BROADCASTS NOT THAT EXPENSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Thank you for printing Martin Miller's article ("TV Brings City Councils to 
O.C. Homes -- Warts and All," Jan. 30) on cable broadcast of city council 
meetings in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller says in his article that, regarding nine cities that do not broadcast 
the meetings, "most cities say they want it but lack the funds to install the 
technology."I investigated the situation in Fullerton at the request of Alan 
Morton, who was mentioned in the article. I found that Fullerton's posture of 
"lack of funds" was based on a 1990 consultant's report that estimated the 
installation costs at $135,800. The estimate presumed a "Rolls-Royce" 
installation. In December, 1993, I proposed to Council Member Molly McClanahan 
a "no-frills" installation that would have cost only $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, city staff issued a memo that stated "staff does not take issue 
with Mr. Hume's suggestion that council meetings could be broadcast using a 
single fixed camera and the existing audio source for $15,000 to $20,000." 
</P>
<P>
 The staff's memo was dated Dec. 14, 1993. Because of the memo, pro-broadcast 
Council Member Chris Norby requested that the issue be placed on the Jan. 18 
council agenda, but it was not. McClanahan has never answered my written 
questions about how much the costs of installation would have to be mitigated 
before she would endorse broadcast of council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 The excuse of "lack of funds" is a red herring raised by staff and politicians 
who wish to avoid public scrutiny of their behavior.

CHANGE FOR THE GOOD AT FAIRVIEW CENTER; * OUTPLACEMENT OF DEVELOPMENTALLY 
DISABLED IS A START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Fairview Developmental Center in Costa Mesa offers a textbook example of 
changing theories in serving the developmentally disabled in California. With 
the settlement last month of a lawsuit, more changes are in store. They are 
likely to be good ones. 
</P>
<P>
 The result of the settlement, reached in San Francisco Superior Court, will be 
to reduce the populations of Fairview and the six other developmental centers 
in the state. Equally important is the provision of money to finance the 
outplacements and to provide the high standards of care that the patients 
deserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Fairview opened in 1959, yet it is the newest of the state facilities. Once 
called a "state hospital," it now is called a "developmental center." Those 
once termed "patients" are now referred to as "clients" by the staff. The 
"mentally retarded" are now designated "developmentally disabled." 
</P>
<P>
 But more than terminology changed, as Fairview administrators wisely adapted 
new research into better treatment for those in their care. The Legislature has 
also kept an eye on treatment of the developmentally disabled throughout the 
state, as it should, and has updated laws for the treatment of the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost since Fairview opened, however, the prevailing thinking in the state 
has shifted to trying to move people out of hospitals and into smaller units in 
the community for anyone able to live in that setting. The lawsuit settled last 
month was originally filed in 1990, and argued that the state had dragged its 
feet in transferring patients out of hospitals. The plaintiffs were parents who 
wanted their children moved into the community and support groups for those 
suffering disabilities such as autism and cerebral palsy. The state agreed that 
paring the hospital population was a good idea but argued it did not have the 
money. But the state did agree as part of the settlement to spend more money on 
community facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents were understandably upset by the settlement, insisting that the 
treatment their children receive at Fairview and other hospitals was better 
than they could expect outside the hospitals. But that is true for only a small 
minority of patients, those who need such intense therapy that they probably 
will never be able to leave the hospital. For those, Fairview is best. But for 
anyone able to leave, the best answer is leaving, and living in a house with 
five or six others with good medical supervision, rather than at Fairview. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement does not set up quotas to remove patients. The roster of those 
hospitalized will be reduced by minimizing the number of new patients admitted 
and by discharges and natural deaths of patients already hospitalized. Fairview 
now has about 1,000 patients, a substantial decline from its high of 2,600 in 
1968. 
</P>
<P>
 Another justified concern of some parents was that too many community 
facilities shut down and forced the transfer of patients back to the hospitals. 
The settlement provides for the state to increase its activity in the community 
to keep as many patients there as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 A major impetus to the settlement was winning a waiver from the federal 
government to let more Medicare money earmarked for treatment of patients in 
hospitals be spent on the same patients in community facilities. That's a good 
idea, so long as the homes in the community are carefully monitored to ensure 
they are providing high levels of care. Both plaintiffs and defendants in the 
lawsuit said they are pleased with the settlement, a good sign that the 
developmentally disabled will be protected.

HOMEOWNERS LOCK OUT A HARSH REALITY; * BARRING MIGRANTS FROM TRABUCO HIGHLANDS 
ONLY MAKES A BAD SITUATION WORSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How does an affluent area like Orange County get a situation like that endured 
by the people of Porterville? Last week, this powerless group of tenants, 
caught in a dispute between their landlord and a nearby homeowners association, 
began making steps to leave their migrant camp since they were left with no 
other alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unsatisfactory conclusion for the tenants, the William Lyon Co. and 
landlord Sam Porter reached an agreement in July, 1992, whereby the association 
got the right to build a gate blocking the 645-home subdivision from the ranch. 
The association had complained of traffic and noises generated by the tenants 
in the streets of Trabuco Highlands. Earlier this month, the gate was installed 
and locked, leaving tenants no way onto the ranch except by walking at least a 
mile along a creek bed. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood association says it isn't happy about the outcome, but that 
it was unavoidable. The landlord says the tenants are victims of racism. The 
county, meanwhile, has tried to dismantle the shantytown community over the 
years, citing numerous fire, safety and health code violations. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the tenants are caught in the middle. They work in nurseries nearby, 
but like many migrants toiling in agriculture they are apparently supposed to 
be seen by day and forgotten after nightfall. Fortunately, there are some 
people in this sorry tale who are doing more than lamenting that things are out 
of their hands. A group from nearby St. John's Episcopal Church and School in 
Rancho Santa Margarita was helping to find the families new homes. 
</P>
<P>
 It shouldn't have come to this. Isn't there something the county can do to 
help these people find better living arrangements? Isn't it possible to give 
the residents the time they need to find new quarters? Can't the homeowners 
lighten up until this difficult situation is resolved in a more satisfactory 
manner for these people who are victimized and powerless?

ROHRABACHER'S HARSH RHETORIC MISREPRESENTS LATINOS AND FACTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Rep. Dana Rohrabacher's (R-Huntington Beach) political ambitions are causing 
an entire population to be dehumanized and criminalized. 
</P>
<P>
 Rohrabacher thinks that the major problem after the quake is the undocumented 
working community and then by implication the entire Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
 Rohrabacher not only conveniently overlooks our productive membership in this 
economy but key facts have escaped him. For example, the best research today 
indicates that the majority of undocumented immigrants are in fact members of 
productive, wage-earning households, not social loafers. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, a large number of those in fact are currently awaiting legalization 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, his figures on the size of the undocumented population are not correct. 
The federal government itself has concluded that the undocumented population is 
less than 4% of the total California population. Latinos are only one-third of 
that percentage. And barely 7% of the state's entire Latino population lacks 
legal status. 
</P>
<P>
 Rohrabacher wants us voters to believe that undocumented immigrants are now 
also a drain on disaster relief funds. This is ridiculous. Sound public policy 
cannot be built on the basis of fear, hysteria and deliberate misinformation. 
And to play upon people's fears in this time of crisis is outright racism. 
</P>
<P>
 I've met Dana several times in Costa Mesa and I come away each time convinced 
that he would say or do anything to get reelected. 
</P>
<P>
 So, Dana I'll ask you once again to cease making the Latino community your 
whipping boy for all of California's problems. Your statements do nothing to 
build stronger multiethnic societies. They only foment fear, hatred and civil 
strife. 
</P>
<P>
 The next time I see you I'll have to remind you that my neighbors and I are 
wage-earners and professionals; we are educated and we vote because we are 
citizens. We were also born in Mexico.

AUTO MALL WOULD DRIVE OUT NATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am writing in regard to the article "36-Acre Auto Mall Planned For Rancho 
Santa Margarita," Jan. 29.All this within a 450-acre business park -- all under 
either cement or macadam! And a projection of 611,400 residents. Who needs 
this?! 
</P>
<P>
 There is now a constant drone of traffic -- anytime, day or night! Where are 
the beautiful hills, areas to meander along, original grasses, brush? They have 
either been lobotomized or paved under -- topsoil gone forever! How much money 
does the O'Neill family need? Wasn't Mission Viejo enough to fill their 
coffers?

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON EL TORO; LET IRVINE CO. SWAP FARMLAND FOR 
BASE, THEN WISELY DEVELOP IT; NOW THAT AN AGENCY HAS BEEN FORMED, IT'S TIME TO 
FORMALLY KILL THE AIRPORT OPTION AND EXAMINE CREATIVE SOLUTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY AGRAN, Larry Agran, an attorney, is a former mayor of Irvine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't easy, it wasn't pretty, and too much valuable time was lost. But the 
Orange County Board of Supervisors deserves credit for finally putting together 
a new government authority to oversee the conversion of the Marine Corps Air 
Station at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the supervisors have an opportunity to get beyond the arguments about who 
decides; they can help us all to focus on what we'll decide. 
</P>
<P>
 First, however, these veteran politicians are going to have to publicly 
acknowledge what they privately know to be true: As long as the proposal to 
convert the military base at El Toro into a commercial airport is the only plan 
we talk about, it will be impossible to develop a countywide consensus for the 
conversion and redevelopment of El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because residents in southern and central Orange County understand that 
tens of thousands of commercial aircraft overflights every year will destroy 
their peace, quiet, property values and quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not enough to simply state that a commercial airport at El Toro is a 
bad idea. It's time to start exploring some good alternative ideas. I think 
I've got one -- a new proposal that's worth putting on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's my idea: The 4,700-acre Marine Corps Air Station at El Toro is, of 
course, owned by the federal government. It is surrounded by thousands of acres 
of highly productive agricultural land owned by the Irvine Co. Why not arrange 
for a historic public-private land swap? 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the swap, the Irvine Co. would deed thousands of acres of 
its agricultural land to the federal government. These magnificent lands would 
be placed in trust, ensuring that much of Orange County's remaining 
agricultural open space would be permanently preserved, forever free of 
development. In exchange, the federal government would deed ownership of the El 
Toro base to the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
 But the company would get more than ownership. It would also receive the 
federal funds earmarked for military base conversion, including the hundreds of 
millions of dollars needed to clean up the toxic wastes that now contaminate 
the soils and subsoils at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the costly, labor-intensive cleanup task was underway, The Irvine Co. 
would have rights to develop the base, subject to two conditions: First, there 
could be no commercial airport development at El Toro -- that would be a closed 
issue once and for all. Second, in its development of El Toro, the Irvine Co. 
would be expected to make use of the city of Irvine's $125 million in state 
rail-bond funds to build an innovative monorail system that would serve the El 
Toro-Irvine area and later expand to other parts of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 What are the benefits of this kind of a land swap and development agreement? 
</P>
<P>
 * For the Irvine Co., the swap would be a chance to do what it does well -- 
assert itself as the master developer of a large tract of land, mixing 
commercial, residential and industrial development. In this case, the 
development could take place within the broad guidelines of a 
federal/county/private agreement allowing for what amounts to a large-scale 
enterprise zone that promises unusual flexibility and profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the conversion of El Toro would involve the cleanup and restoration of 
land damaged by toxics, the Irvine Co. would not only have access to millions 
of dollars of cleanup funds, it would also find itself wearing the hat of 
environmental protector. In addition, the swap would permit the Irvine Co. to 
do what it soon has to do anyway -- abandon its "neutrality" on the proposal to 
build a commercial airport at El Toro. Everyone knows that thousands of 
overflights from commercial air operations at El Toro would devastate Irvine, 
the world-famous planned community that bears the company's name. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Irvine Co. were to stand by and let this happen, it might as well trade 
in its reputation as a "community builder" for a new sobriquet: "community 
buster." 
</P>
<P>
 * For Orange County residents, the early redevelopment of El Toro (but not as 
an airport) will put many thousands of people to work. Thousands of scientists, 
engineers and technicians will be needed for the difficult work of cleaning up 
the toxic mess at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 Still more workers, with other special skills, will be needed to begin the 
design and construction of the Irvine monorail, which can be the first 15-mile 
link in an extended monorail or "fixed guideway" system that connects most of 
Orange County's cities, including Mission Viejo, Irvine, Santa Ana and Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Already the site of an Amtrak station, the Irvine-El Toro area is perfectly 
positioned to become a "National Center for Transportation and Environmental 
Excellence" -- a place where thousands work on rail technologies that we first 
manufacture for our own use here in Orange County, then for sale throughout the 
country and even throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The design and manufacture of modern rail systems can provide Southern 
California with the same kind of economic boom by 2000 that military and 
commercial aviation was providing in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 * For the federal government, the El Toro/Irvine Co. land swap is a chance to 
produce a large-scale base conversion success story. It's a chance to shut down 
military operations at El Toro by 1997, as originally planned. 
</P>
<P>
 But the shutdown will take place while a ready-to-go environmental cleanup and 
redevelopment plan is already underway. These arrangements can be part of a 
negotiated land swap that could take place as early as next year. The federal 
government, of course, would emerge with thousands of acres of orange groves 
and prime agricultural land -- a revenue-producing resource but also a 
remarkable open-space resource for everyone who lives and works in Orange 
County or who visits here. 
</P>
<P>
 The government could declare these lands a "National Urban Agricultural 
Preserve," maintaining current farming operations. Or, to effect military 
relocation costs, federal authorities could arrange for rapid resale of the 
agricultural lands. The resale could be part of a popular statewide or local 
bond issue, generating many millions of dollars in quick cash. It could also 
involve the American Farmland Trust or a similar private nonprofit entity that 
would oversee and manage the permanent agricultural operations. 
</P>
<P>
 * For high elected officials -- most notably the five county supervisors, Rep. 
Christopher Cox (who represents Irvine and El Toro), and U.S. Sens. Dianne 
Feinstein and Barbara Boxer -- a land swap and early conversion of El Toro 
represents a chance to demonstrate some real leadership. But if these officials 
are to spare us many years of costly fighting over an airport, they'll have to 
set aside their various shades of neutrality on the issue and take a stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Land swaps with the military aren't new to Orange County. Small-scale swaps in 
the 1970s and 1980s were very successful. 
</P>
<P>
 So, what's it going to be? A 15-year battle over an unneeded and unwanted 
commercial airport at El Toro? Or a large-scale, historic land swap that can 
quickly combine the dual benefits of open-space preservation and planned 
redevelopment?

COMMERCIAL EL TORO AIRPORT COULD ERODE -- OR ENHANCE -- QUALITY OF LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Regarding the letter (Jan. 30) from the chairman of the Committee for El 
Toro Airport Tomorrow (CEAT): 
</P>
<P>
 It may be of interest, to those who might be impressed by Mr. (Eugene H.) 
Moriarty's letter, to know that there are 11 people listed on CEAT's letterhead 
as comprising its executive and advisory committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 11, only one lives in Irvine; eight of the rest reside in areas remote 
from the Marine Corps air station at El Toro, in areas such as Garden Grove, 
Anaheim and Orange. One practices law in Irvine, but his residence area is not 
inferable for lack of a residential phone listing. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Moriarty apparently does not live anywhere near the airport he proposes to 
commercialize, nowhere in the area bounded by Corona del Mar, Silverado, Carbon 
Canyon and Seal Beach -- either that or he has an unlisted residential 
telephone number. 
</P>
<P>
 Surely, should a commercial El Toro become a reality and turn out to be an 
uneconomical community nuisance, Mr. Moriarty and his ilk will be the first "to 
feel the pain" of those living near it. 
</P>

 * It would be nice to see South County have a new golf course, recreation 
center, community park, major sporting complex or jail. Each of these ideas has 
merit. However, in today's economic environment, we must make the best decision 
on how to use any of our existing assets. The decision on how to best use El 
Toro (Marine Corps Air Station) is no different. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4,700-acre air station has been developed extensively as an airport during 
the past 50 years at the cost of hundreds of millions of our tax dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as the owners of this property, are we taxpayers going to intentionally 
ignore the capital improvements we have made in this property, or will we 
attempt to build on the value of the property as it exists today? 
</P>
<P>
 I don't enjoy listening to airport noise, but with that small distraction 
comes a very significant benefit: high-paying jobs! The continued development 
of the airport as a cargo facility can be the economic engine that will power 
South County into the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 The Saddleback Valley has historically been a bedroom community with a small 
job base. Our children will be driven out of this community due to a lack of 
high-paying, high-tech jobs unless we make the correct decisions today that 
will attract and keep those jobs.

MURDER SENTENCE FOR RAPE SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The circumstances regarding (Jose Alonso) Garcia's life ("Rape Stole 
Victim's Will to Live, Prosecutors Say," Jan. 23) don't matter to me. What he 
did was wrong.He quite simply broke the law. I find it unfortunate that the 
victim, Mary Ward, died only a month after the assault. However, this event 
isn't directly related to the case. The defendant should be tried for his 
transgression and punished accordingly. My concern is will the punishment fit 
the crime? The answer is ultimately "no." 
</P>
<P>
 I want Garcia to be tried for murder because the sentence he would receive for 
rape does not fit the crime he committed while the punishment for murder does. 
This is the reason why I and so many others like me cheer at "Dirty Harry" and 
"Die Hard" movies when the bad guy is blown away. I am an average American 
citizen. I believe in and support this country, but too often these days I feel 
trapped between political correctness and criminal rights. Whatever happened to 
justice? 
</P>
<P>
 So, if a burglar steals a treasured heirloom and the owner becomes depressed 
and sad and later dies, I do consider it murder. Until the sentence is swift 
and sincere enough to be regarded as a deterrent and an actual punishment or 
until rehabilitation really works, I say we charge the defendant with as much 
as possible while we have the opportunity. Let's protect and spare family, 
friends and neighbors from the same possible tragedies.

DANA POINT HAS GONE BANANAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * What's this about parks not being welcome in Dana Point ("Parks Have Worn 
Out Their Welcome," Jan. 25)? 
</P>
<P>
 Where have I been hiding out lately? I knew it was bad news when we lost our 
Park and Recreation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 If a park is a haven for crime and violence as Councilman Mike Eggers 
contends, let's do something about it, Mike! Brighter lights, more police 
surveillance. As far as attracting "undesirable elements," a member of our 
Planning Commission, Carlos Olvera, thinks it's partly the NIMBY 
(not-in-my-back-yard) syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 I think it's gone beyond that . . . it's gone BANANAs. Build Absolutely 
Nothing Anytime Near Anything. Or, Ban Anybody Near Anything Now and Always -- 
take your pick . . . (sigh).

SUPERVISORS SILENTLY ASSENT TO DESTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * There used to be an oak tree in Laguna's Woods Canyon close to where I live. 
It grew in a tight ravine, its branches crossing horizontally to the sloping 
ground. One could walk along one of the two branches to the main trunk and sit 
there with a friend or in solitary meditation. The bark of this ancient giant 
was smooth and the leaves exceptionally large. 
</P>
<P>
 This patriarch oak and 20 or so companions provided refuge for owls and other 
birds. From underneath its broad base at the bottom of the ravine there was 
water coming up from the earth and spilling into a patch of green grasses and 
watercress. In the branches above the water a hummingbird sat on its tiny nest. 
Deer would come there to the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Today this majestic oak and its community are gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Laguna Beach residents watched helplessly as Mission Viejo Co. 
bulldozers eliminated the trees and the shelter they provided. There was no one 
to be reached for an explanation of this senseless and sudden destruction, no 
warnings, no hearings, no discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 One does not expect sensitivity from a profit-oriented developer; but why does 
our county leadership lack the wisdom to prevent cultural, historical and 
environmental losses such as this? Why was this small remaining growth of oaks 
destroyed in a time when we are beginning to appreciate the position of trees 
and wild places in our shared universe? Such increasingly rare places have 
special value as points of connection between ourselves and the Earth we live 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 The massive grading done by the majority of Orange County developers is the 
simplest and least costly way to build homes in our canyons and hills. But it 
destroys the natural contours of hillsides, brings up dead, alkaline subsoil 
and exposes the new homes to dangerous landslides. 
</P>
<P>
 If developers instead followed the natural undulations of the terrain, the new 
homes could become part of the existing landscape and ancient trees would not 
have to be destroyed. Such methods are more costly and produce fewer homes, but 
they preserve the natural structure of the canyons for all the residents of the 
community.  
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County supervisors have a responsibility to protect their present 
and future constituents. Their inaction is tacit approval for the destruction 
of our natural surroundings.

QUAKE SHOWS DANGERS OF AN ELSMERE LANDFILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * We in the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys have a silver lining to the 
Jan. 17 earthquake. The proposal by the city and county of Los Angeles to put a 
190-million-ton landfill in Elsmere Canyon has been dealt a "10" on the Richter 
scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsmere Canyon is adjacent to the intersection of the 5 and 14 freeways. For 
years geologists have warned the landfill proponents that this area -- the 
Newhall Pass -- is an area of enormous seismic instability. Hopefully, with 
this act of God, they will now listen. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguably, the Newhall Pass, the juncture of two major mountain ranges (the 
Santa Susanas and the San Gabriels), is the most seismically unstable area in 
Southern California. The 1971 Sylmar quake and the Northridge quake originated 
from two separate fault lines. Yet, in both, serious and costly damage occurred 
in the Newhall Pass. 
</P>
<P>
 I am sick to my stomach when I think what would have happened had the landfill 
been in place when this quake hit. The elevation of our valleys and surrounding 
mountains changed by feet in the course of 30 seconds. Landfills produce deadly 
methane gas. No methane gas system, however sophisticated, could have withstood 
the vertical jolt. The methane gas cloud produced by 190 million tons could 
have killed thousands of people in a passage across our valley floors. 
</P>
<P>
 Geologists cannot yet predict earthquakes. But, along with engineers, they can 
determine potentially dangerous areas in which construction should be avoided. 
Elsmere Canyon is seismically dangerous and should be avoided as a landfill 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally frightening is the fact that the Los Angeles Aqueduct runs right 
through Elsmere Canyon. A contamination of this precious water supply with 
garbage toxins would delay the delivery of a pure water supply by weeks, if not 
months, when the major quake hits. It goes without saying that the plastic 
landfill liner -- designed to protect the acknowledged underground aquifer in 
Elsmere Canyon -- would be breached and the ground water contaminated in the 
next serious earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The already congested Newhall Pass could not support the projected 2,400 trash 
trucks per day under the best of circumstances, and the construction of the 
required landfill off-ramp seems unwise. 
</P>
<P>
 We insist that Mayor Riordan, the Los Angeles City Council and the county 
Board of Supervisors take heed of this warning and immediately cancel the Joint 
Powers Agreement permitting expenditure of taxpayers' dollars for this insane 
and deadly proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Elsmere Canyon Landfill is no longer about the preservation of the Angeles 
National Forest or property values. It is about the preservation of human life.

 * The criticism by Mary Edwards and Esther Simmons of my Jan. 9 Valley 
Commentary article supporting the Sunshine Canyon Landfill (Letters, Jan. 16 
and 23) deserves a response. 
</P>
<P>
 Turning most of Sunshine Canyon into a landfill will not represent the largest 
percentage removal of land from a county significant ecological area. The 542 
acres in the canyon constitute only 2.5% of the 21,680 acres of SEA 20. SEAs 
are not protected by law from any sort of development. About half of several 
SEAs have been lost to development. A few have been totally lost. Defeating BFI 
in its attempt at expansion in Sunshine Canyon will not protect the entire 
remaining system of SEAs. 
</P>
<P>
 Should Sunshine Canyon eventually harbor an operating landfill, large-animal 
migration will continue across Newhall Pass. The present major migration route 
is between the I-5 overpass just north of the Weldon overpass. The passage 
would continue to direct animals into the forests in Weldon and Gavin canyons. 
These lead into the entire Santa Clarita Woodlands. Verification can be 
obtained from the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy. Should Sunshine Canyon be 
an important part of the migration path despite the freeway barrier, its value 
will return after landfill closure. 
</P>
<P>
 Grasses, flowers and shrubs will grow on a filled and closed landfill. 
Herbivores of many species eat these plants and, in turn, become food for the 
raptors and other carnivores. Grasslands constitute a particularly important 
base to food chains. Plenty of forest will remain for cover and habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 Several neighboring canyons are more pristine than Sunshine Canyon and have 
more biological values. Members of the San Fernando Valley Audubon Society have 
been studying spotted owls, pygmy owls and other rare species in these canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 The mitigations attending the expansion of this landfill are not back-room 
deals. They are the results of careful deliberations between the county and 
BFI, which not only protect an unusually large amount of wilderness (950 acres) 
but also provide added protection to the local human environment. In a complex 
democratic society, compromise and mitigation are the keys and tools of solving 
problems such as Sunshine Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago, I wrote lengthy responses to the environmental impact reports and 
proposed long lists of mitigations. I now realize that the mitigations were a 
waste of time and space as far as many opponents were concerned. However, other 
parts of my responses are avidly quoted by Mary Edwards. They may have been 
incorporated in briefs presented to various state courts. 
</P>
<P>
 During my assignment to O'Melveny Park, I once believed the persuasive 
arguments of the North Valley Coalition. It was the "in" thing in this 
community to fight the landfill and, for the sake of city and community, I was 
generally cooperative. However, my studies of the biology of the city park and 
the entire Santa Clarita Woodlands continued. In time, I concluded that 
Sunshine Canyon was not so unique or special at all. In addition, I was always 
a "pro-park" person rather than strictly "anti-dump." These factors caused me 
to change course on the landfill issue. Biologists, including myself, are not 
static. With new knowledge, they modify their beliefs.

GOVERNMENT CAN TAKE STEPS TO HASTEN RECOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Along with thousands of our fellow San Fernando Valley residents, my family 
suffered loss and destruction in the recent earthquake. It will take tremendous 
effort to put our home and our lives back together again, but I am proud to be 
an Angeleno as we now pull together to rebuild our city. 
</P>
<P>
 I was also, until recently, California's state director of planning and 
research. The office I headed was responsible for many of the proposals to 
streamline state permitting and regulatory procedures, and for designing 
small-business tax incentives. I believe there are immediate steps that both 
the state and federal governments can take to speed our rebuilding efforts in 
Southern California: 
</P>
<P>
 * Enact legislation providing for tax credits for out-of-pocket earthquake 
losses not covered by insurance. Many people who have lost their homes have no 
earthquake insurance, or have very high deductibles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Provide emergency, expedited permitting and regulatory relief to allow 
businesses to rebuild or relocate as quickly as possible in order to get the 
local economy back up and running. Slow permitting processes and fear of 
environmental liability under federal laws have left some facilities damaged or 
even unused. 
</P>
<P>
 It is essential that we get California families and businesses back on their 
feet as quickly as possible. Government needs to help us rebuild our jobs and 
homes. I call on all our elected leaders to move quickly.

 * The 6.6 earthquake that arrived at 4:31 in the morning on Jan. 17 has 
affected our community and its residents, some severely. Many needed to take 
action to save their lives and those of their families. 
</P>
<P>
 I am a physician in private practice in the San Fernando Valley and serve as 
chief of staff at West Valley Hospital & Health Center in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 I want to personally and publicly praise the medical staff and hospital staff 
of West Valley Hospital for their heroic services during this disaster. Within 
minutes, the on-duty staff assessed and stabilized the patient population and 
hospital structure and put the triage code into effect. The additional 
physicians, nurses and other hospital staff members arrived within the hour 
following the earthquake to assist with the influx of hundreds of injured 
community residents.

PULL TOGETHER AND REBUILD BOTH L.A. AND ITS ECONOMY; LOS ANGELES MUST TAKE 
ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY CREATED BY THIS CRISIS, AND MUST RECOGNIZE THAT 
THE EARTHQUAKE DID NOT DESTROY OUR REGION'S MANY ECONOMIC STRENGTHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS L. LEE, Thomas L. Lee is 1994 chairman of the Los Angeles Area 
Chamber of Commerce and chairman and chief executive officer of the Newhall 
Land & Farming Co. in Valencia. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 earthquake not only shattered homes, businesses and freeways but 
also challenged our region's near-term prospects for an economic upturn. 
</P>
<P>
 How can we help Los Angeles return to the slow but steady recovery which was 
occurring before the earthquake? 
</P>
<P>
 To begin with, Angelenos must recognize that the earthquake did not destroy 
our region's many economic strengths -- increasing international trade, a 
thriving entertainment industry, cutting-edge high-tech firms, esteemed 
universities and medical institutions, to name a few. 
</P>
<P>
 We must build upon these strengths. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Los Angeles must take advantage of the opportunity created by this 
crisis. The nation and the federal government, from the President on down, are 
focused on this disaster. We must not delay seeking assistance -- from 
infrastructure work to job generation to housing -- to repair the damage. We 
must also keep the media's focus on Los Angeles' recovery activities. 
Otherwise, the federal government and the media will move on to other problems, 
and our recovery will become more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, local governments must circumvent the usual bureaucratic delays in 
issuing permits for the rebuilding of homes and businesses. Rebuilding will 
generate thousands of well-paying construction jobs, which will translate 
directly into economic growth. Accelerated permits and construction will get 
quake-damaged businesses back to work faster. 
</P>
<P>
 One way to jump start this much-needed rebuilding is opening one-stop permit 
centers in the San Fernando Valley, Santa Clarita Valley and other hard-hit 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, state and local government must accelerate seismic retrofits of 
freeways, public buildings, schools, commercial structures, apartment buildings 
and parking garages. This will create jobs in the short-run and lessen the risk 
of future damage and economic dislocation. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth, state and local governments must continue to complete the construction 
of our regional mass transit system. The opening of new Metrolink stations in 
Sylmar, Canyon Country, Lancaster and Palmdale within a week of the earthquake 
was nothing short of amazing. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional expansion of mass transit will create jobs, further strengthening 
our economic recovery. In the long run, mass transit will lessen our region's 
over-dependence on often fragile freeways as well as reduce traffic and air 
pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Caltrans and the region's construction companies must continue to 
repair our freeway system as quickly as possible. In so doing, we will 
eliminate a drag on our economic recovery, remove a frustrating reminder of the 
earthquake and demonstrate our region's recovery in no uncertain terms to the 
rest of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, how do we pay for these projects? 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles must obtain all the federal assistance to which it is entitled, 
not just for big jobs like freeway repair but for individual homes and 
businesses as well. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We must make use of available government funds. For example, the state did not 
spend $237 million from a 1990 earthquake safety bond issue. Nor did Los 
Angeles spend $345 million from its $376 million 1990 bond issue for seismic 
improvements on public buildings and bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 We must seek additional state assistance for infrastructure repairs and 
retrofits, school rehabilitation and additional preparedness programs, among 
others. When other parts of California experienced such natural disasters as 
the Oakland fire and Loma Prieta earthquake several years ago, Southern 
California assisted their rebuilding. Now Los Angeles needs all Californians' 
support in passing emergency legislation in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Hollywood should continue its welcome efforts to raise funds for 
earthquake repair projects. Some stars could host telethons to raise money for 
damaged schools. Others could hold concerts to benefit low-income families who 
lost their homes and possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 If all Angelenos draw together, we can overcome our current challenge, and the 
entire world will know. This June, the monthlong World Cup soccer tournament 
will be held in Los Angeles. Hundreds of millions of people worldwide will be 
watching. Let's make sure that they see a Los Angeles where all residents and 
businesses have banded together not only to repair the earthquake damage but 
also to put our community and economy firmly on the road to recovery.

RECOVERY OFFERS US CHANCE TO CHANGE WAY WE DO BUSINESS; WE MUST TURN THE QUAKE 
INTO AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRANSFORM BUREAUCRACIES. HOUSING, TRANSIT AND GOVERNMENT 
SERVICES ARE AREAS THAT CAN USE BOLD CHANGES FOR THE LONG TERM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By LAURA CHICK, Laura Chick represents the 3rd District on the Los Angeles City 
Council.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The destruction brought by the Jan. 17 earthquake was enormous, but I'm 
beginning to witness hope amidst the despair. As I've visited the shelters, 
parks, damaged businesses and hard-hit residential neighborhoods in my 
district, I've been heartened by the countless ways our city has come together 
in this crisis, reconnecting the frayed bonds of community. 
</P>
<P>
 That heady spirit may ebb as we settle back into our ordinary lives. However, 
we cannot let the positive energy generated by tens of thousands of Angelenos 
dissipate without capitalizing on it. As humans, we must learn from tragedy and 
then do our best to turn it into opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Let us commit ourselves in the coming months to making Los Angeles and the San 
Fernando Valley a model for new ways of doing business. Let's get imaginative 
-- even heretical -- at all levels of government. If we cannot transform rigid 
bureaucracies and outmoded habits today, when everything is fluid, we'll never 
be able to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake is forcing us to experiment. Instead of flinching from change, we 
should cull lessons from the experiment that we can utilize in the coming 
years. Several opportunities have been thrust upon us: 
</P>
<P>
 * We must use this period to create a better kind of affordable housing for 
the Valley. The Valley had an affordable-housing crisis before the earthquake. 
Now we have tens of thousands of people of all ages, backgrounds and income 
levels in desperate need of housing. The private sector must fill this need for 
those who can afford market-rate housing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Valley suffers from a disadvantage: Unlike the rest of the city, the 
Valley does not have an experienced nonprofit housing development community to 
deliver housing in the coming months. Now is our opportunity to develop this 
network, and in the process transform the term "affordable housing" from a 
negative into a positive. We need to create this grass-roots network of 
nonprofit housing developers so the Valley can have affordable housing that is 
attractive, compatible with surrounding areas and seismically sound. 
</P>
<P>
 If we don't respond quickly, I fear that informal solutions people will find 
-- sleeping on the streets, living in their cars, renting illegal and unsafe 
garages -- will create deep structural scars in our society that could prove 
more expensive to fix than the physical earthquake damage itself. 
</P>
<P>
 * Commuters have adjusted to riding trains and buses, taking alternate routes, 
ride-sharing and driving on one-way streets. Innovative transportation 
strategies cannot be reserved for the Olympics and for emergencies. When all of 
the freeways return, let's break gridlock in Los Angeles -- permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 * Just as I've been proud of the cooperation among residents, I've also been 
heartened by the close coordination between city departments during this 
emergency. But why should it take an earthquake for departments to communicate 
with one another, for city employees to adopt a can-do attitude, and for the 
delivery of services to be restructured? The flexible, streamlined, 
customer-oriented approach we've seen in recent days must lay the groundwork 
for a more efficient city government when the emergency ends. 
</P>
<P>
 These opportunities are just the start. The coming months must be a time when 
we embrace all opportunity -- to create a more flexible workplace, new venues 
for educating our children and a different tone of everyday life. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles should err on the side of being too bold, not too timid. It is 
well known that after the 1989 Loma Prieta quake, San Francisco muddled through 
with half measures that have left the reconstruction unfinished five years 
later. We should not repeat their mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 It may not be fashionable to say anymore, but I still love L.A. -- despite all 
that we've been through lately. I've heard it suggested that the earthquake 
served as a noisy exclamation point, putting an end to the all-too-long string 
of tragedies that have struck our city. As we open a new era, let's do things 
right this time.

SMALL CLASS SIZE MAKES FOR A BIG SUCCESS STORY; AN 11TH-GRADE ENGLISH PROGRAM 
THAT WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO RECEIVE FUNDING FROM THE MORGAN-HART ACT EVOLVES 
INTO A COMMUNITY OF LEARNERS AND WRITERS.

<P>
 We're in the midst of a great call for education reform across the state and 
across the nation. My colleagues, who have been in the education arena longer 
than I, are unimpressed. They say they've heard it all before. 
</P>
<P>
 They tend to think that education ultimately happens in the classroom. Quality 
education means well-trained teachers, modern buildings, decent equipment and 
low student-teacher ratios. 
</P>
<P>
 And they often add that since the government seems willing to pay for none of 
those things, the picture is pretty hopeless. 
</P>
<P>
 I often find myself sharing their gloom. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year, the Morgan-Hart Act, passed by the state Legislature in 1989, 
reached my classroom. Morgan-Hart, named for state Sens. Roberta Morgan, its 
originator, and Gary Hart, allocated money to reduce class size in lower 
elementary grades and senior high. It sets a goal of classes of 20 students in 
all core high school classes, although reaching the goal depends on funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Until that utopia is reached, districts apply for grants from the state and 
spend the money where they think it will do the most good. In Los Angeles, it 
goes to 11th-grade English. 
</P>
<P>
 It's true there's not enough money for all classes in all grades, not enough 
for all school districts. And it has taken years for any money to reach its 
destination. But it's a whole lot better than nothing, and when it comes its 
effects are immediate and positive. 
</P>
<P>
 In my 11th-grade English classes, combined American literature and 
contemporary composition, Morgan-Hart translates to a cap of 20 students as 
opposed to the usual 35 to 40. It may not seem like much if you have never 
taught high school English, but for those of us who have, it's the difference 
between success and failure. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With 20 in a class, we do a lot more reading and a lot more writing. Danny, 
one of my students, wrote in a mid-semester letter evaluating the class and his 
progress in it: "During the first three weeks of this class I thought I had 
died and gone to hell. Every night there was writing to do -- descriptive 
paragraphs, thesis statements, narratives. I didn't think you'd ever let up. 
Who'd expect English to be tougher than Chemistry? 
</P>
<P>
 "I really poured my heart into the autobiographical incident and it's the best 
thing I've ever written." 
</P>
<P>
 With 20 in a class, every student gets involved. No one falls through the 
cracks. There's lots of positive peer pressure and no corners in which to hide. 
The class is more personal than a class of 40 students could possibly be. 
Before we left for winter recess, several students requested that next semester 
the class remain the same -- no new students in, none out. They have 
established groups within the class which work well, each student contributing 
his or her share. On a campus of more than 2,700 students, it's especially 
important that students feel some ownership, at least for part of their day. 
</P>
<P>
 In a smaller class it's not "me" managing "them." Instead, we're developing as 
a community of learners. For example, when we read Edgar Allen Poe's "The 
Raven," everyone got to voice an opinion and, even though I've read the poem 
dozens of times, the students helped me understand some nuances I hadn't 
noticed before. The students were able to come to a knowing without a lecture 
from me. They felt comfortable enough to risk stating what they thought and 
felt. The work became theirs, not something to memorize in order to pass a 
test. 
</P>
<P>
 Because we are a small community of writers, we see our work as "works in 
progress." We sometimes use my own writing as class exercises, dissecting it on 
an overhead projector. We can spend 10 minutes arguing over a sentence -- which 
verb fits best, did I stick to my thesis or get off-track.  
</P>
<P>
 We remind one another, as we slash each other's papers with the mighty red 
marker, not to fall in love with our words. Students who were used to turning 
in their first efforts as good enough are now redoing their papers three or 
four times, improving them with each revision. With half my previous student 
load, I have time to read and comment on each of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Los Angeles' Morgan-Hart money doesn't help senior English with 
its 40 students per class, and it doesn't help the emergency credentialed math 
teacher next door who is struggling with 38 students every period. But it has 
greatly helped my 11th-grade students. And, like the teacher from San Jose who 
wrote to Morgan, I feel renewed, "like I've died and gone to heaven."

HELP FOR THE HOUSEBOUND; HEAD START FAMILY CENTERS ARE TEACHING WOMEN WITH 
LIMITED ENGLISH, FEW SKILLS AND NO CHILD-CARE OPTIONS HOW TO BECOME 
ENTREPRENEURS -- AT HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANA BEARD-WILLIAMS, Diana Beard-Williams is director of the Glendale 
Family Service Center. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kelly Donaldson sits pensively across the desk from a young woman who quietly 
assures her that she wants to work and earn money but just doesn't see how it's 
possible. She has three children, all under the age of 5, limited English and 
no idea of what she's capable of doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well" -- Donaldson takes a deep breath and smiles -- "have you thought about 
self-employment?" 
</P>
<P>
 Self-employment? For a housebound, unemployed mother living on government 
checks? Yes, indeed. It has been an important part of employment training for 
two years at the government-supported agency where I work. We are helping 
people learn to be cottage entrepreneurs, running small businesses in their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 My agency is part of a network of 66 Head Start family service centers, 
created in 1991 as an offshoot of the federal program for low-income preschool 
children. Staffed by six people, including Kelly Donaldson, it tries to address 
some of the root causes of the poverty of the children in Head Start: substance 
abuse, illiteracy and, its highest priority, unemployability. Women from about 
one-third of the 230 predominantly Armenian and Latino Head Start families in 
our area seek our assistance and support. Men are eligible, but it's mostly the 
women who feel comfortable enough to reach out and chart a new destination for 
their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Head Start family service centers have wide latitude in setting up programs. 
Self-employment training, along with English as a second language, has become 
the cornerstone of ours. The concept grew out of the realization that cultural 
traditions and unresolved child-care needs dictated that many women can't work 
outside the home. 
</P>
<P>
 We started traditionally, with classes in resume writing and dressing for 
success. This approach assumes that people have basic skills, that they'll be 
able to go to work outside the home and that jobs will be waiting for them. 
Those assumptions proved wrong in many cases. A lot of people learned to dress 
for success but had no success in the marketplace afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of our women had resigned themselves to staying home -- welfare does 
that. For those wanting to learn a traditional skill such as being a medical 
assistant or a preschool child-care assistant, we had plenty of outside classes 
available. We were looking for innovation. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to these traditional classes being offered as viable employment 
training possibilities, we started our three home-based entrepreneurship 
courses in early 1992. They are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Home entertainment and decoration consulting. In 15 weeks of classes taught 
by outside consultants, our women learn to sew everything from lingerie to 
living room drapes. They learn to design flower arrangements, gift baskets, 
jewelry and T-shirts; to decorate cakes, and how to be wedding and party 
consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-one women have completed the technical classes, and 11 are now in eight 
weeks of workshops on marketing, accounting, inventory maintenance and 
licensing. We're also about to lease space in shopping malls and private 
boutiques where they can display their goods until they accumulate enough money 
to be on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 * Licensed family day care. This is an eight-week course focusing on the rules 
for operating a family day-care center and basic child-development skills that 
include age-appropriate activities for the children. Participants are supported 
through the actual fingerprinting and licensing process, which includes 
extensive paperwork. Because of the shortage of affordable day care, the women 
feel confident of attracting customers. Eight women have enrolled in the 
course. One recently got her license and has four infants under her care. Two 
other women are in the licensing process. 
</P>
<P>
 * Word processing. We have outside consultants who teach our clients, one on 
one, to publish newsletters, prepare reports and do general typing at home. 
Some who take this have no typing background but their desire to learn propels 
them forward. This is an open-ended program with, at present, seven students. 
One deterrent to self-employment in this area is that mothers on welfare do not 
have the resources to buy computers. We are trying to get together some money 
to help them get set up. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as I know, we are the only Head Start family service center doing what 
we are doing. We have taken our show on the road, describing the center's work 
before the National Head Start Bureau in Washington and Atlanta and the 
National Assn. for the Education of Young Children in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Self-employment may not be for everyone, but I recommend that it be part of 
any agency's job-training strategy. Entrepreneurship is for everyone.

KINGS BEATEN IN LAST MINUTE; HOCKEY: MACINNIS SCORES WITH 37.4 SECONDS LEFT IN 
OVERTIME, GIVING FLAMES 5-4 VICTORY. GRETZKY 10 SHY OF HOWE. 
</P>

 Almost everything about the Kings is murky and filled with some sort of 
intrigue these days.  
</P>
<P>
 On the ice, they are performing with constant unpredictability. Saturday, the 
Kings failed to survive a wild overtime as Flame defenseman Al MacInnis scored 
a power-play goal with 37.4 seconds remaining, giving Calgary a 5-4 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 The Flames went on the power play when King defenseman Doug Houda went off for 
cross-checking Theoren Fleury. On the game-winner, center Pat Conacher lost the 
draw and after a scramble, Gary Roberts fed it back to MacInnis at the right 
point. MacInnis beat King goaltender Kelly Hrudey between the pads. 
</P>
<P>
 "That one looked like the puck just had eyes," MacInnis said. "It took a short 
hop up and went between his legs." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hrudey: "Regardless of that, I've been around long enough to cover it 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 But King Coach Barry Melrose was upset that Luc Robitaille's cross-checking 
penalty in overtime ended their power play and killed the momentum. "When your 
leaders are doing that, you are in trouble. You just can't do that," Melrose 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Gretzky, who had been having a quiet game, was responsible for pushing 
the game into overtime, scoring his 26th of the season, with two minutes 
remaining in regulation. And he had some help from Flame defenseman Frank 
Musil's skate. 
</P>
<P>
 The sellout crowd of 16,005 at the Forum celebrated along with Gretzky, who 
needs 11 goals to break Gordie Howe's all-time record of 801 goals.  
</P>
<P>
 But it didn't stop the Kings (19-27-6) from losing their third consecutive 
game, remaining in 10th place in the Western Conference with one victory in 
their last nine, going 1-6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 This one almost slipped away with a shoddy second-period effort in which the 
Kings gave up four consecutive goals, including three in a span of 4:34. Their 
collapse allowed the Flames to turn a 2-0 deficit into a 4-3 lead by the end of 
the second as the Kings briefly rallied to pull within one on Robitaille's 
second power-play goal of the night, at 9:42. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings had come out swinging in the first period. Perhaps they were 
inspired after Saturday's morning skate by watching the tape -- three times -- 
of former teammate Marty McSorley's lengthy bout against Bob Probert in the 
Pittsburgh-Detroit game on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 But it doesn't take much to get ready for a natural rival like Calgary. The 
Flames have been leading the Pacific Division since Oct. 30 and had not had 
much competition for first place until a recent surge by Vancouver. Now, 
Calgary leads the Kings by 17 points in the division. 
</P>
<P>
 It's difficult to tell what is going on off the ice. Melrose held a team 
meeting and brought in individuals. Owner Bruce McNall appeared in the dressing 
room on Friday, according to several players, which surprised them. General 
Manager Nick Beverley has not been speaking much with his coaches -- by phone 
or in person. He was in Sweden last month when Martin Gelinas was put on 
waivers by Quebec and picked up by the Canucks when the Kings could have used 
him. Now, with the Kings mired in another losing streak, Beverley is in 
Michigan on another scouting trip. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall acknowledged that there are continuing problems. "I think there is too 
much of it (differences)," he said. "I've always tried to be the bridge. . . . 
I try to find a way to bring some harmony, if there's disharmony. Maybe's 
there's more than I recognize."

BRUINS LOOK MORE LIKE NO. 104 IN LOSS TO IRISH; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: UCLA SHOOTS 
ONLY 31.7% AGAINST NOTRE DAME, WHICH IS 7-13 AFTER 79-63 UPSET. 
</P>

<P>
 Attention, UCLA fans, this just in: Before anyone starts buying those Final 
Four tickets, there is something you should know. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame 79, UCLA 63. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a sellout crowd of 11,418 Saturday at the Joyce Athletic Convocation 
Center, UCLA was colder than the snow piled up outside and about as soft, 
losing to an Irish team that isn't going to the Final Four unless it takes a 
bus tour. 
</P>
<P>
 It was easily the season lowlight for UCLA, 15-2 with two losses in three 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming off a 29-point blowout of USC, the Bruins produced their fewest points, 
fewest points at the half (28), most turnovers (20), worst shooting (31.7%), 
not to mention worst mood in the locker room afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just came out and stunk it up on national TV," Ed O'Bannon said. "I think 
that's something to be embarrassed about. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know anyone can be beaten at any time, but if you play the way we played 
today, you are going to get beat no matter if you're No. 4 or No. 104." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Bannon had 14 points and nine rebounds for UCLA, who were led by Tyus 
Edney's 17 points, seven of them free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Edney: "This won't be good for our morale." 
</P>
<P>
 It did wonders for Notre Dame's. Monty Williams had 28 points in 38 minutes 
for the Irish (7-13), whose season has featured losses to Duquesne, St. 
Bonaventure and Loyola of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame was coming off an 18-point victory over Cal State Northridge, so if 
anyone is interested in comparison scoring, UCLA is two points better than 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, maybe not, but the Bruins were a whole lot worse than Notre Dame. As 
coaches like to say, it was a team effort, even if the direction they were 
going was reverse. 
</P>
<P>
 If they had an open shot, they missed it. If they had an easy pass, they threw 
it away. If they needed a big defensive play, they gave up a layup. 
</P>
<P>
 "Murphy's Law game," Coach Jim Harrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not Eddie Murphy, either, although the Bruins sometimes seemed to be 
downright comical in their transgressions, such as Cameron Dollar's alley-oop 
that went into the third row or Marquis Burns' missed dunk or George Zidek 
falling backward out of bounds or Ed O'Bannon airballing a three-pointer. 
</P>
<P>
 After throwing the ball away 13 times on turnovers, UCLA was fortunate to be 
down by only eight points, 36-28, at the half. The Bruins quickly fell behind, 
47-32, not at all comfortable with being bumped around by Irish defenders. 
</P>
<P>
 It became clear that the book on playing UCLA is to be physical, contest every 
pass and try to get them to shoot from the outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teams are starting to adjust to us," Ed O'Bannon said. 
</P>
<P>
 After playing Thursday night against USC and traveling all day Friday, the 
Bruins didn't seem to have a lot of spring in their legs, but Harrick said he 
wasn't going to use that as an excuse. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins had one small comeback left in them. With Notre Dame ahead, 49-34, 
Burns, playing because Charles O'Bannon fell on his wrist and injured it, made 
a couple of free throws and Edney added two more. When Ed O'Bannon rebounded 
his missed shot and scored, the Bruins were within 49-40. 
</P>
<P>
 They got as close as 51-44 at 12:29 on a couple more free throws by Edney, but 
on the next five UCLA possessions, the Bruins had four turnovers and a missed 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm embarrassed," Ed O'Bannon said. "I don't want to down the other team, but 
I feel we should have won. We didn't play well, didn't ever get anything 
going." 
</P>
<P>
 Any idea why? 
</P>
<P>
 "If I knew, it wouldn't have happened," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said he thinks the Bruins failed to take the Irish seriously. He said 
a friend whom he would not identify but who plays for California told him that 
the UCLA players regarded the Notre Dame game as an easy victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like it was a bye for them," Williams said. "That kind of makes you mad." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA missed 25 of 33 shots in the second half. The Bruins were 0 for 16 from 
the three-point line, which means that in their two defeats, UCLA is one for 35 
from long distance. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst part was toward the end. Notre Dame finished the game with two dunks 
and a layup, fans streamed out of the stands to celebrate, players fell on the 
floor in joy and the Irish marked their fifth consecutive victory in the series 
at the Joyce Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrick said the closing dunks didn't mean much. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lost fellas, whether it's two or 22, what's the difference?" he said. "How 
many times a year do they have a chance to be excited? It basically saved their 
season." 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Kurowski, who scored 19 points in 25 minutes, said he had a reason to be 
proud. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are always comparing us to Notre Dame football," he said. "They go to 
bowl games and they are in the top 10. People tell us, 'You're never even in 
the top 50 and you lose to schools we never heard of.' We showed 'em today." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ed O'Bannon: "We'll use this. There's no way we're going to forget it." 
Bruin Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Rodney Zimmerman was not in uniform because of a back injury that kept him out 
of practice last week. Coach Jim Harrick said Zimmerman will get an MRI exam. 
Said Zimmerman, who kept himself out of the game: "I let them down. I 
apologized to the team. It'll never happen again." . . . Charles O'Bannon 
re-injured his left wrist and went scoreless in 14 minutes, O'Bannon fell on it 
in a game at Washington Jan. 15. Harrick said O'Bannon will have X-rays. . . . 
George Zidek led the Bruin turnover derby with seven in 21 minutes. Harrick's 
reaction? "My heavens, goodness gracious."

DRAG RACING / WINTERNATIONALS AT POMONA; YOUTH PAYS MINOR DIVIDENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Larry Minor, the potato baron from Hemet, put together his drag racing 
team this season, he reversed the trend toward experience and went for youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Minor dropped his popular veteran top fuel driver, Ed McCulloch, 52, in favor 
of Cory McClenathan, 31. For his funny car, Minor kept Cruz Pedregon, 30, who 
won the National Hot Rod Assn. championship in 1992, his rookie funny car 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend had been the other way. Eddie Hill, the defending top fuel champion, 
will be 58 next month. John Force, the defending funny car champion, is 44. 
</P>
<P>
 Minor's youth movement paid dividends Saturday when his two McDonald's drivers 
won the No. 1 qualifying positions for today's 34th annual Chief Auto Parts 
Winternationals at the Pomona Raceway. Eliminations start at 10:30 a.m., with 
$1,290,200 at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 McClenathan, who left his Yorba Linda-based, family-owned team to drive for 
Minor, set a track record of 4.774 seconds to wrest the top spot from Jimmy 
Nix, 55. The 16-car top fuel field is the fastest in NHRA history. The slowest 
qualified car is former four-time champion Joe Amato's, at 4.920. 
</P>
<P>
 The fastest previous field was the one that qualified last year at Heartland 
Park in Topeka, Kan., where the slowest time was 4.931. McClenathan was 
quickest there, too, running 4.762, the fastest official quarter-mile in drag 
racing. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Kalitta powered his family's American International Airlines car to a 
track-record 303.03 m.p.h., but his elapsed time of 4.802 was only fourth 
fastest, behind McClenathan, Nix and Shelly Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, a Cal State Fullerton graduate, became only the eighth driver to 
better 4.80 seconds with her run of 4.789 in a car prepared by her father, Brad 
Anderson, a former three-time top alcohol funny car champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he was in a different car, with a different uniform, it was more of 
the same for McClenathan. This was the third time in a row that he had been 
fastest qualifier at Pomona. His 4.784 was tops in last year's Winternationals, 
and so was his 4.795 last October in the Winston Finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very pleased the way our new team has jelled," McClenathan said. "I think 
one reason was that we made a (TV) commercial for McDonald's and got to work 
with each other before we started testing. Then we went to Firebird (near 
Phoenix) and ran 4.750, so we came here with a positive high." 
</P>
<P>
 The run at Firebird is the unofficial all-time quickest top fuel run. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having owned a race team, as I did with my family for three years, helped me 
make the adjustment to a new team," McClenathan said. "I've been coming to the 
track with the same enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is one big difference and that's not seeing all the bills and invoices 
coming to my house. I feel extremely relaxed. Maybe that's the reason." 
</P>
<P>
 McClenathan will meet Amato in the first round, setting up a curious 
circumstance. Jimmy Prock, who was McClenathan's crew chief during his three 
years as driver of the family's Mac Attack top fueler, now has the same job 
with Amato. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be strange, running against Prock, but it's definitely going to 
be a rivalry all season long," McClenathan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedregon's time of 5.010, set in the first round Thursday, stood up through 
three days of time trials for the funny cars. His quickest run Saturday was 
5.028. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't go any faster, but we were very consistent," Pedregon said. 
"Consistency is what wins rounds, and winning rounds wins races. That's what 
we're looking for this year, and the team is pleased with the start we've 
made." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the fourth time Minor's cars have been No. 1 in both top fuel and 
funny car qualifying. It is also the second consecutive Winternationals in 
which Pedregon has been quickest. 
</P>
<P>
 His speed of 297.06 m.p.h. was a personal best and the fastest in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordie Bonin, driving the Smokin' Joe Mustang that was introduced in the 
off-season with such flair, failed to qualify. His best was 5.522, in 18th 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren Johnson, two-time pro stock champion from Sugar Hill, Ga., in an 
Oldsmobile Cutlass, continued to dominate his class with a track-record 
7.060-second run at 195.69 m.p.h. It was Johnson's third consecutive No. 1 
qualifying position at Pomona.

HARPER'S EFFORT DOES TALKING; PRO BASKETBALL: OFTEN-OUTSPOKEN CLIPPER GUARD 
EARNS TRIPLE-DOUBLE IN 500TH GAME AND KEYS 122-110 VICTORY OVER KINGS. 
</P>

<P>
 Outspoken Clipper guard Ron Harper, who sometimes gets more attention for what 
he says, let his game do the talking Saturday night against the Sacramento 
Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper recorded the third triple-double of his NBA career, getting 24 points, 
10 rebounds and 10 assists as the Clippers handed the Kings their eighth 
straight road loss, 122-110, before 10,773 at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, who received the game-ball after playing in his 500th NBA game, made 
nine of 25 shots, including two three-pointers, and made four of five free 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper didn't know that he had played in his 500th game until informed by a 
reporter after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you for telling me," Harper said. "It was my 500th game . . . 500th 
game and a triple-double. That's how much they know. I play my 500th game and 
they didn't even tell me. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's all right. It was a good 500th game. I'll take the win. I don't care 
about no triple-double." 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper forward Danny Manning had 27 points and nine rebounds as the Clippers 
(16-27) ended a two-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning had 13 points in the third quarter, hitting six of seven shots, as the 
Clippers shot 66.7% and outscored Sacramento, 35-26, to overcome a six-point 
deficit and take a 93-88 lead into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Two others starters scored in double figures as the Clippers handed Sacramento 
(13-31) its ninth loss in the last 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Elmore Spencer, who had averaged 13 points in his last three games, 
scored a career-high 19 points, 13 in the first half, and grabbed seven 
rebounds. Rookie forward Harold Ellis had 18 points, including 14 in the second 
half. Guard Mark Jackson had eight points and seven assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward-center John Williams, who was suspended for the first 42 games after 
entering a weight reduction center at Duke University, played his first game of 
the season after being activated Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who reportedly weighed 330 pounds before entering the weight loss 
center, is listed at 270 by the Clippers. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who received a warm ovation when he entered the game with 2:43 
remaining in the first quarter, had three points, two rebounds and three 
assists in 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "John looked good," Clipper Coach Bob Weiss said. "He did the things 
defensively for us and he made some nice passes to set up easy shots." Clipper 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Grinker, Danny Manning's agent, maintains that the Clippers won't trade 
Manning because Coach Bob Weiss has asked General Manager Elgin Baylor to 
retain the All-Star forward. "Danny told me that Bobby Weiss says he wants him 
to stay there," Grinker said. "I guess if Bobby's going to say that, it's going 
to take away from them trading him." Weiss denied making the statement, saying 
that Grinker might have misinterpreted a statement he made before a recent 
practice. "I didn't mention any player specifically. I said, 'If this is the 
way we go to the end of the season I'll be happy with that,"' Weiss said. 
Manning declined comment. Clipper spokesman Joe Safety said: "As usual, it's 
apparent that Danny's representative is manipulating the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers, who might open the 1994-95 NBA season in Japan, are being 
considered to play in a four-team exhibition tournament in Mexico City before 
the start of next season. The other teams being considered for the tournament 
are Houston, San Antonio and Seattle. Details could be finalized at next 
weekend's All-Star game in Minneapolis. . . . Sacramento guard Randy Brown sat 
out the fourth quarter after spraining his left knee in the third quarter.

GOLF ROUNDUP; MILLER TURNS BACK CLOCK WITH 67, GAINS ON HART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dudley Hart, the leader through three rounds of the Pebble Beach National 
Pro-Am, is one of the young men Johnny Miller is trying to impress. 
</P>
<P>
 And the 47-year-old Miller, making one of his rare appearances on the PGA 
Tour, will go head to head with Hart, 25, today in the final round of the 
$1.25-million tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, now a television commentator, has won only once -- the 1987 edition of 
this tournament -- in more than a decade. He shot a five-under-par 67 Saturday 
to pull within one stroke of Hart's 10-under-par total of 206. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart and Miller will play in the final foursome at Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Watson, with a round of 72, trails Miller by one stroke at 208. Ted Tryba 
is another shot back at 209 after a round of 69. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-round leader Davis Love shot a 78 and dropped out of contention at 213. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 George Archer and Kermit Zarley were part of a four-way tie for first place 
after the second round of the Royal Caribbean Classic at Key Biscayne, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Charles and J.C. Snead also shared the lead at 137, five under par. Seven 
other golfers were within three shots of the lead in the senior tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 First-round leader Lee Trevino, slowed by a balky putter, watched five players 
overtake him and slipped two strokes back with a two-over 73. 
</P>
<P>
 Snead and Zarley each shot 66. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 11 of 78 players broke 70 as many struggled to read greens that were 
redesigned after last year's tournament. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Ian Woosnam shot a four-under-par 68 and tied Fred Couples for the third-round 
lead in the $900,000 Johnnie Walker Classic at Phuket, Thailand. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Norman of Australia shot a course-record eight-under 64 and tied 
Germany's Bernhard Langer and Taiwan's Hsieh Chin-sheng for third place. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman, one stroke behind the leaders, came into the tournament with a lung 
infection and didn't practice before the event. If he finishes first or second, 
he will replace Nick Faldo of England as the world's top-ranked player. Faldo 
failed to make the cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples, who has held the lead since the opening round, shot a 70 for a 
three-round total of 208, matched by Woosnam. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Davies, who almost wasn't allowed in the tournament, was tied for the 
lead with Lisa Walters going into today's final round of the LPGA Palm Beach 
Classic at Lake Worth, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Davies has seven birdies and an eagle on the eight par fives during the first 
two rounds. Her two-round total was 134 after a 69 Saturday. Walters shot a 68 
and Dawn-Coe Jones was two strokes back after a 69. 
</P>
<P>
 Davies was originally marked down for the new Oldsmobile-sponsored event at 
Michigan in June and omitted from this field in a mix-up. 
</P>
<P>
 LPGA Commissioner Charles Mechem allowed Davies to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the more notable not to make today's final round: Hall of Famer JoAnne 
Carner (145), Brandie Burton (147) and Patty Sheehan (146).

 Senior Grant Hill scored a career-high 33 points, including 15 of Duke's 17 
points during a key five-minute second-half stretch, to lead the No. 1 Blue 
Devils to a 78-74 Atlantic Coast Conference victory over Clemson at Durham, 
N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, a 6-foot-8 forward, made 10 11 of 12 free throws and had nine rebounds, 
six assists and two steals as he helped the Blue Devils (16-2, 7-2) bounce back 
from their loss to No. 2 North Carolina on Thursday. Devin Gray paced Clemson 
(12-9, 3-6) with 22 points.  
</P>
<P>
 No. 2 North Carolina 77, North Carolina State 64 -- Jerry Stackhouse scored 11 
of his 17 points in the second half and Dante Calabria scored five consecutive

<P>
 No. 5 Connecticut 73, Miami 57 -- Donyell Marshall scored 20 points as the 
Huskies (19-2, 8-1) gave Coach Jim Calhoun -- who missed the last two games 
because of pneumonia -- his 400th victory with an easy Big East Conference 
decision over Miami (7-11, 0-10) at Storrs, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 6 Arkansas 131, Montevallo 63 -- The Razorbacks (16-2) scheduled 
Montevallo (16-9), an NAIA school, last summer after a game with Illinois fell 
through, and crushed the Falcons behind 21 points by Scotty Thurman at 
Fayetteville, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 10 Temple 73, St. Bonaventure 52 -- The Owls (16-2, 9-1) extended the

critical Penn State fast break when he lost a contact lens to lead the Hoosiers 
in a Big Ten Conference game at State College, Pa.

<P>
 Officials stopped play for Graham with 3:52 left, interrupting a Penn State 
five-on-four break that could have cut Indiana's lead to two. After Graham was

close again.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL / PAC-10 ROUNDUP; HUSKIES FINALLY WIN ONE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just minutes after Washington defeated No. 12 Arizona, 74-69, for its first 
Pacific 10 Conference victory of the season Saturday at Seattle, first-year 
Coach Bob Bender raced for a telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you hear our score yet, Coach?" an ecstatic Bender asked excitedly. 
</P>
<P>
 The coach on the other end of the line was Duke's Mike Krzyzewski, a former 
Bender mentor. Bender played and was an assistant coach at Duke. 
</P>
<P>
 "This game means more than just one win in this particular year," Bender said. 
"For our kids to finally be rewarded for all of their hard work makes it really 
special." 
</P>
<P>
 Maurice Woods and Jason Tyrus each scored 20 points as Washington (3-15, 1-9) 
beat the Wildcats for the third time in four games in Seattle and broke a 
nine-game overall losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Damon Stoudamire had 21 points to lead Arizona (17-4, 6-3), which had a 
four-game winning streak broken, but he was only one of 10 from three-point 
range. Backcourt mate Khalid Reeves had 17, but made only one of eight 
three-point attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoudamire compared the defeat to Arizona's 64-61 loss to Santa Clara in a 
first-round NCAA tournament game in Salt Lake City last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought in my wildest dreams that we would lose to this team," 
Stoudamire said. "It was just like the Santa Clara game. I haven't seen 
Washington play much, but I know they had to be playing better than they've 
ever played in their lives today." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington State 73, Arizona State 70 -- Mark Hendrickson's three-point shot 
with no time left lifted the Cougars to a dramatic victory at Pullman, Wash.  
</P>
<P>
 Washington State led, 70-67, with 4.5 seconds to go when the Sun Devils' 
Stevin Smith made a three-point shot to tie the score. On the final possession, 
Eddie Hill dribbled upcourt and then hit Hendrickson with a pass with a second 
remaining. Hendrickson shot from the right side, just behind the three-point 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 Hendrickson scored a game-high 24 points for the Cougars (15-6, 5-4), who also 
got 21 points from reserve guard Isaac Fontaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith led the Sun Devils (11-7, 6-3) with 23 points, and Dwayne Fontana and 
Isaac Burton added 18 and 16, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 19 California 81, Oregon 61 -- Before a crowd of 8,975 -- Oregon's largest 
since the 1990-91 season -- Jason Kidd had 19 points, 11 assists and seven 
rebounds and Lamond Murray had 26 points and 12 rebounds to lead the Bears 
(14-4, 7-2) over the Beavers (6-12, 2-7) at Eugene, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford 71, Oregon State 67 -- Brent Williams scored 27 points, including two 
clinching free throws with 4.8 seconds left, as the Cardinal defeated the 
Beavers at Corvallis, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Poppink scored 24 points and grabbed 16 rebounds for Stanford (13-15, 
6-3). Brent Barry scored 19 for Oregon State (5-13, 1-8), which has lost five 
in a row.

GONZAGA SHOWS WAVES WHY IT'S ON TOP, 70-48; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: POOR SECOND 
HALF LEAVES PEPPERDINE WITH ITS WORST WCC HOME LOSS SINCE 1973. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Just when everything appeared to be falling into place, Pepperdine's 
basketball team took a giant step backward Saturday night against West Coast 
Conference leader Gonzaga. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of their worst outings ever at home, the Waves absorbed a 70-48 loss to 
Gonzaga before 3,296 in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 How bad was it? 
</P>
<P>
 It was their worst WCC home loss since a 96-71 defeat by San Francisco in 1973 
at Veterans Memorial Auditorium in Culver City -- the final season before 
Firestone Fieldhouse opened. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also their worst home loss since an 88-62 defeat by Kansas in the 
1990-91 season. 
</P>
<P>
 And it was their lowest point total since they lost, 67-46, to UC Santa 
Barbara in the opening game of the 1989-90 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a good, old-fashioned butt-kicking, that's all it was," Pepperdine 
Coach Tom Asbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 The game didn't start out that way for the Waves (12-8, 4-4). Although Gonzaga 
led most of the way, Pepperdine trimmed its deficit to 28-25 by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Bulldogs (15-5, 7-1) went on an 11-2 run at the start of the second 
half and never led by fewer than nine points the rest of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was especially satisfying for Gonzaga Coach Dan Fitzgerald, who 
recorded his first success in 11 tries at Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've played some great games here and lost," he said. "Tonight, I thought we 
just played a great second half. To come in and hold them to (23) points is 
really remarkable." 
</P>
<P>
 The Waves made 37% of their shots in the second half, and guards Damin Lopez 
and Bryan Parker were a combined 5 of 24 in the game. Gonzaga made 62.1% of its 
shots in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Jeff Brown scored 22 points and guard Geoff Goss 15 for Gonzaga.

BROWN'S 10 THREE-POINTERS NOT ENOUGH FOR UC IRVINE 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UC Irvine hung close to Pacific during much of the first half Saturday night 
and got to within six points with six minutes to play, but the Anteaters gave 
up a couple of easy layups and took a couple of quick shots and lost, 88-79, in 
front of 4,571 at the Spanos Center. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the sixth loss in a row for UC Irvine, which got 36 points and a 
school-record 10 three-point baskets from Chris Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown also tied the Big West Conference record for three-pointers, set by 
Freddie Banks of Nevada Las Vegas in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "The effort was pretty good," Irvine Coach Rod Baker said, "but in crucial 
situations, we just didn't make the plays." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine is 5-13 overall and 2-8 in the conference. Pacific is 14-8, 8-3, half a 
game behind New Mexico State. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters suffered from the same problem that has contributed most heavily 
to their recent woes. Pacific shot 54% from the floor and Irvine made only 39%.

 Cal State Fullerton's basketball team finally got the close game it wanted 
Saturday night against San Jose State, but the Titans came up short. 
</P>
<P>
 A 15-foot jumper by Fullerton's James French bounced off the rim with five 
seconds left, and the Spartans held on for an 84-82 Big West Conference victory 
at the Event Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans, who had lost their previous two games by 22 points to Long Beach 
State and by 31 points to Pacific, are 4-15 overall and 2-9 in the Big West. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose (11-8, 7-4) swept both regular-season games from Fullerton for the 
first time since 1981. The Spartans beat the Titans, 69-63, two weeks ago. MIKE

SANTA BARBARA HOLDS OFF LONG BEACH STATE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Long Beach State could not convert two possessions in the final 4.7 seconds 
Saturday, and UC Santa Barbara held on for a 67-66 Big West Conference victory 
in the Events Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara (9-12, 5-5) took a 67-63 lead with 21 seconds left on a basket 
by forward Doug Muse.It followed his steal of a Long Beach pass intended for 
Terrance O'Kelley. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rod Hannibal of Long Beach (10-6, 5-4) made a three-point shot with 12 
seconds left, and Santa Barbara's Wayne Butts missed both free throws after a 
foul by Brian Camper with nine seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach got the ball, and after timeouts by both teams, the ball was 
inbounded to O'Kelley. Muse blocked the shot, but Long Beach retained 
possession with 1.2 seconds remaining. After a timeout, Jeff Rogers lobbed the 
ball over the hands of Hannibal to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Four three-pointers by Hannibal helped the 49ers tie the score twice in the 
second half, the second time at 58-58. 
</P>
<P>
 Butts put the Gauchos up for good, 61-58, with a three-point shot with 4:11 to 
go. Rogers made a three-point shot, and Mike Atkinson hit a pair of free throws 
as the 49ers stayed close. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a messy first half. During one span, the teams combined to turn the 
ball over eight times in nine possessions. There were 24 turnovers in the first 
half alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara led, 34-30, at halftime. PAUL McLEOD

LOYOLA GAINS MOMENTUM WITH 2ND STRAIGHT VICTORY; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: LIONS STOP 
PORTLAND, 91-79, AND MOVE WITHIN ONE GAME OF THIRD PLACE IN CONFERENCE PLAY.

<P>
 Loyola Marymount continued to earn newfound respect in the West Coast 
Conference by beating Portland, 91-79, Saturday night at Gersten Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third victory in four games for the Lions (4-15, 3-5), who moved 
within a game of third place in the WCC after starting the weekend tied for 
last.It gave Loyola back-to-back conference victories for the first time since 
the 1991-92 season, having upset first-place Gonzaga on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it sends a message to the rest of the conference," Coach John 
Olive said, "but it shows us that we're capable of playing with and beating 
anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 All five Loyola starters scored in double figures for the first time this 
season, led by sophomore center Ime Odouk with 19 points, 10 rebounds and a 
Gersten Pavilion-record five blocked shots. Guard Robin Kirksey added 18 points 
and forward Wyking Jones had 17 points and a game-high 13 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions led by as many as 15 points in the first half before Portland 
(11-12, 4-4) rallied and pulled within 69-64 on Ronnie Fines' three-pointer 
with 9:25 to play. Loyola responded with a 12-2 run capped by Rahim Harris' 
breakaway dunk to take an 81-66 lead with three minutes left. 
</P>
<P>
 Portland, losing its ninth consecutive game at Gersten Pavilion, got 21 points 
from forward Canaan Chatman, who missed all nine of his second-half shots after 
scoring 18 in the first half.

SKATING FIGURES AS FOCAL POINT OF CBS' WINTER GAMES COVERAGE 
</P>

<P>
 In January of 1984, a month before it would televise the Winter Olympics at 
Sarajevo, Yugoslavia, ABC agreed to pay $309 million for rights to the 1988 
Winter Olympics at Calgary, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal, made in Lausanne, Switzerland, left a sour taste in the mouths of 
Roone Arledge and other ABC executives. 
</P>
<P>
 They believed they had been had. The bidding was turned into an open auction 
by Barry Frank, acting as a consultant to the International Olympic Committee, 
and it pushed the price higher than anyone believed possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The $309 million was three times greater than the $91.5 million ABC had paid 
for the Sarajevo Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna de Varona, who was then Arledge's assistant, recalls that Frank had ABC 
over a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roone was very big on motivating the troops, and losing out on the Calgary 
Olympics one month before the Sarajevo Olympics would have killed morale," De 
Varona said. "Frank knew he could take Roone to the wall." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank got his price, but the Calgary Winter Games would be the last Olympics 
televised by ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 By agreeing to pay so much, ABC took itself out of the bidding for the 1988 
Summer Olympics at Seoul, Korea, which went to NBC for $400 million. 
</P>
<P>
 De Varona recalls that Arledge told IOC President Juan Antonio Samaranch that, 
at these prices, there was no way one network could televise two Games in the 
same year, as ABC had done during the years it billed itself as "the network of 
the Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
 If Arledge was right, one network would always be automatically eliminated 
from the bidding. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a solution, however. Arledge suggested that the IOC stagger the 
Winter and Summer Olympics, holding one every two years instead of both every 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The IOC, normally a slow-moving, cautious group, acted quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting at Lausanne in October 1986, the IOC, prompted by Samaranch and its 
11-member executive board, broke a 70-year-old tradition and rather quietly and 
without much fanfare agreed to stage a Winter Games in 1994 and continue 
thereafter at four-year intervals. 
</P>
<P>
 So now CBS, only two years after televising the Winter Olympics at 
Albertville, France, will be televising another. 
</P>
<P>
 Only last month, CBS also won the rights to the 1998 Winter Games at Nagano, 
Japan, with a bid of $375 million, which was $80 million more than the rights 
fee for this month's Winter Olympics at Lillehammer, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS has lost the NBA, major league baseball and the NFL, but now it can bill 
itself as "the network of the Winter Olympics." 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that we have the experience and the confidence in our production and 
sales staffs to do the Winter Olympics better than anyone," said Neal Pilson, 
president of CBS Sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "NBC knows the Summer Olympics, and that gives them an advantage there." 
</P>
<P>
 And the new setup -- an Olympics every two years -- is good for everyone in 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are only positives," said Mark Harrington, CBS' vice president in 
charge of Olympic coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Klatt, coordinating producer of TNT's coverage, echoed that sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 The big pluses are (1) it spreads out sales, meaning sponsors aren't asked to 
support two Olympics in one year; and (2) it spreads out promotional aspects. 
</P>
<P>
 It would seem also to be a plus for viewers. They no longer will have a 
four-year wait for an Olympic competition. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 CBS will devote 120 hours to the Lillehammer Winter Games, with 50 hours in 
prime time. 
</P>
<P>
 TNT will add 45 hours of supplemental weekday coverage of the event, which 
opens next Saturday and runs through Feb. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS generally will have three blocks of coverage, with a fourth added on some 
weekend days. 
</P>
<P>
 Weekdays, coverage will run 7 to 9 a.m., 8 to 11 p.m. and 12:37 to 1:37 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 TNT's weekday coverage will run from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 With Lillehammer nine hours ahead of the West Coast, almost all of CBS' 
programming will be tape-delayed. Some of TNT's will be live. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Gumbel will be the host of CBS' prime-time coverage, replacing Tim 
McCarver and Paula Zahn, who split that chore at Albertville in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Gentile, CBS' senior vice president of production, admits that the "fit 
wasn't right" with McCarver and Zahn. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Gumbel, he said, "He's an easy look and listen, a good traffic cop, 
personable and a good story teller." 
</P>
<P>
 Oversimplifying it, Gumbel said, "My job is to make sure I don't make people 
throw up." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "I'm no genius. If it was up to me, I'd mount the goalie on the 
goalie-cam (rather than the other way around)." 
</P>
<P>
 Gumbel's younger brother, Bryant, was the prime-time host for NBC at the 1988 
Seoul Olympics. Similarities between Greg and Bryant are only coincidental. If 
Bryant is three-piece suits, Greg is jeans and a T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't bad-mouth Bryant to Greg. "One time someone came up to me and said: 
'You're not the jerk your brother is,' " Greg said. "My response was, 'Have you 
ever met my brother?' He said he hadn't, so I told him he didn't know what he 
was talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 Gumbel co-anchored the weekend morning broadcasts from Albertville in '92. 
</P>
<P>
 Zahn returns for the Lillehammer Games. She and Harry Smith will co-anchor the 
weekday morning telecasts; Andrea Joyce and Jim Nantz will handle the weekend 
daytime slots and Pat O'Brien will again be host of the late-night shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Hosts for TNT include John Nabor, Nick Charles and Fred Hickman. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives of CBS and TNT will meet each weekday to decide which network gets 
what. CBS has priority. 
</P>
<P>
 TNT's Klatt said his network will devote considerable time to hockey, with a 
complete or almost-complete game each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Figure skating figures to be CBS' big sport.

NHL ROUNDUP; PENGUINS OVERHEAT, DEVILS JUST GET HOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Forward Claude Lemieux has a way of annoying the New Jersey Devils' opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a little nudge of his leg annoyed the Pittsburgh Penguins Saturday night 
at East Rutherford, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Boy, did it annoy them. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half an hour after the Devils scored five third-period goals to 
defeat the Penguins, 7-3, several Pittsburgh players were still screaming at 
Matt Pavelich, one of the NHL's supervisors of officials, outside the 
officials' dressing room. 
</P>
<P>
 The topic was Lemieux and his goal at 7:24 that tied the score, 3-3. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Chorske sent a pass toward Lemieux, standing at the right corner of the 
net. He tried to steer it past goalie Tom Barrasso with his stick, but the puck 
hit off his shin and went into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 The Penguins maintained that Lemieux kicked the puck into the net. No, referee 
Don Koharski said, even after the game, and Pavelich said replays were 
inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was three feet away," Koharski said. "It was legal. I'm adamant." 
</P>
<P>
 Koharski said he never asked for a replay, nor was he asked to do so by the 
replay official. 
</P>
<P>
 The Penguins' level of play dropped immediately, especially in the final 5:26 
when Scott Niedermayer, Lemieux, John MacLean and Alexander Semak all scored. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very questionable goal," Penguin defenseman Marty McSorley said. "We 
stopped playing and started arguing. We completely lost our composure. That 
should not happen with that much time left in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington 6, Tampa Bay 3 -- Peter Bondra, who had scored 14 goals in 40 
games, became the 10th player in NHL history to score four in one period, then 
added another in the second period at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 His four goals in one period, on four consecutive shots in a span of 4:12, 
matched an NHL record last accomplished by Joe Nieuwendyk for Calgary on Jan. 
11, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Islanders 3, Quebec 2 -- Right wing Yan Kaminsky, playing in his 
first game for the Islanders, broke a 1-1 tie in the second period, and Travis 
Green added the winning goal at Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
 The Islanders had obtained Kaminsky from Winnipeg Tuesday. He had played in 
only one other NHL game. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was only the third in the last 10 games for the Islanders. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 4, Philadelphia 0 -- Jon Casey, whose poor play put his job in jeopardy 
only three weeks ago, recorded his second shutout in eight days at Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Bourque scored his 15th and 16th goals and added an assist for the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 The Flyers, losers of six games in a row, haven't won on the road since the 
new year began. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 4, San Jose 3 -- Vitali Prokhorov's goal with 5:53 remaining capped 
a three-goal rally for the Blues at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sharks led, 3-1, before the Blues came back on third-period goals by Kevin 
Miller, Kelly Chase and Prokhorov. 
</P>
<P>
 Prokhorov scored the winner on a shot from the slot when a rebound off the 
boards landed at his skates. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 4, Ottawa 3 -- Lyle Odelein and Gilbert Dionne scored third-period 
goals for the Canadiens at Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Canadiens' fourth victory in a row and Ottawa's fourth consecutive 
defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 4, Toronto 3 -- Two goals by Ray Sheppard and one by Sergei Fedorov 
led the Red Wings to a victory at Toronto that ended an 11-game unbeaten streak 
for the Maple Leafs. Toronto is 7-1-4 in its last 12 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Chaisson also scored for the Red Wings, 7-3-1 in their last 11 games.

SANTA ANITA; STALCREEK WINS, ECLIPSES '93 STAR IN THE LA CANADA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saturday was a bad day for Eclipse Award winners. 
</P>
<P>
 Several hours after 2-year-old champion Dehere was upset in Florida in his 
first start of the year, Hollywood Wildcat, the 3-year-old filly champion, was 
soundly beaten in her 1994 debut, the $205,000 La Canada Stakes at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing for the first time in six California starts and seemingly uncomfortable 
on a dull main track, Hollywood Wildcat finished third at 1-2 odds, beating 
only Golden Klair. 
</P>
<P>
 On or near the lead throughout, Stalcreek picked up the biggest victory of her 
career, defeating Alyshena by three-quarters of a length in 1:48 4/5 for the 1 
1/8 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 In a race devoid of pace after Sensational Eyes was scratched, Stalcreek and 
Hollywood Wildcat raced together for the first half-mile, but the former 
asserted her superiority from there and went on to her fifth victory in 11 
starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really proud of her," said David Bernstein, who trains the Stalwart 
filly for owners Gaylord Ailshie and Sena and the late Joe Shields. "She's very 
consistent and tries hard all the time. Gary (Stevens) rode her just super. 
</P>
<P>
 "He decided to go for the lead and run alongside (Hollywood Wildcat), and we 
thought if ever there was a day to beat her, today would be the day. When you 
beat the champ, it really makes you feel good. It was an emotional win, too. 
Mr. Shields passed away (of cancer on Jan 24), but we know he was watching 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens has two victories in three rides on Stalcreek, who was the 5-2 second 
choice, and he liked the way things went from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Hollywood Wildcat) never did look comfortable to me," he said. "She was 
lugging out around the first turn, and I wasn't really concerned with her after 
I turned into the backstretch. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Stalcreek) is a very consistent filly and she ran a huge race today. She 
worked awfully well the other day (Jan. 29). They wanted me to go (the first 
six furlongs) in 1:14 and change, and she went in 1:12 1/5 -- and that was as 
slow as I could possibly go." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Wildcat's trainer, Neil Drysdale, didn't seem especially concerned 
after his filly was beaten by more than five lengths in her initial outing 
since edging Paseana by a nose in the Breeders' Cup Distaff. He admittedly 
hadn't trained her too hard for the La Canada, reasoning that there are more 
important races later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a little fresh and she got tired," Drysdale said. "Eddie 
(Delahoussaye) said some birds flew up in front of her and scared her (in the 
first turn) and she bore out, and the track was still drying out and a little 
loose. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eddie didn't abuse her, and she probably needed the race, anyway. She 
appeared to come back well. She'll be fine. We'll wait and see (about entering 
the Santa Margarita on March 6). It's a long year." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Pleasant Tango, a troubled third in the San Fernando Stakes last month, is the 
5-2 favorite in the $500,000 Strub Stakes today. 
</P>
<P>
 Making his first start since finishing fifth in the Breeders' Cup Classic, 
Pleasant Tango lacked room early in the stretch of the San Fernando, then 
finished well to be third behind Zignew and Nonproductiveasset, both of whom 
are also back for the 1 1/4-mile Strub. 
</P>
<P>
 Kissin Kris, who has the biggest bankroll in the field with nearly $1.4 
million, is the 9-2 second choice. He was fifth in his 1994 debut on Gulfstream 
Park's turf and has worked out three times since returning to California. He 
finished third in the Breeders' Cup Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Zignew, 21-1 in the San Fernando, and Nonproductiveasset, a $40,000 claim by 
trainer Wally Dollase last year, are both 5-1, as is the Allen Paulson-owned 
entry of Diazo and Stuka. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the Strub field, the largest since 1986: Dinand, Justtofit, 
Goldigger's Dream, Tinners Way, Fight For Love and Bat Eclat. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Although it didn't come as easily as expected, Trishyde did what she was 
supposed to do in the $77,025 Las Potrancas Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1-5 favorite against three outclassed opponents, the 5-year-old Nureyev mare 
had to work hard to beat 8-1 shot Afaladja by a half-length in 2:03 for the 1 
1/4 miles on turf. 
</P>
<P>
 The two horses battled for the lead throughout, and after Trishyde opened up a 
one-length margin an eighth of a mile from the finish, Afaladja, who had been 
soundly beaten in three previous U.S. starts, came back to make it close. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dehere was beaten as the 1-10 favorite in an allowance event at Gulfstream 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Running against three other 3-year-olds, the Deputy Minister colt was in front 
through slow fractions most of the way, then was overtaken by Ride The Rails 
and lost by three-quarters of a length in 1:43 3/5 for the 1 1/16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the first start for Dehere since he finished eighth in the Breeders' 
Cup Juvenile on Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he got a lot out of it as I expected," said trainer Reynaldo Nobles, 
who had scratched Dehere from the Hutcheson Stakes a week ago when the horse 
came down with a mild case of colic. "I knew he would need a race. That's why I 
decided to do this. This race got him dead fit, and from here I expect him to 
go forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Dehere, who finished 12 1/2 lengths behind third-place Senor Conquistador, was 
booed loudly when he returned to be unsaddled.

HOMELESS, TINY SATICOY LIBRARY STRUGGLES FOR SOME ATTENTION; SERVICES: SOME SAY 
THE FACILITY IS VENTURA COUNTY'S MOST NEGLECTED. IT OPERATES FROM A COMMUNITY 
CENTER MEETING ROOM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PEGGY Y. LEE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three afternoons a week, a lone librarian lines up four carts in the middle of 
a colorless meeting room, sets up a portable scanner, and the Saticoy Library 
is open. 
</P>
<P>
 The library, the smallest branch in the Ventura County Library system, is also 
the most neglected, neighborhood residents say. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly three years after its former site was demolished, the Saticoy Library 
is still homeless. At one point, it was operating out of a van at a local park. 
Last year, service was cut off for two months during summer. Now it operates 
from a meeting room at the Saticoy Community Center on Violeta Street, where 
the old library once stood. 
</P>
<P>
 "They forget about us out here," said Lark Stevens, who has been bringing her 
children to the various sites for four years. "We need a library. They made 
lots of promises, but we don't have a permanent library yet." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Saticoy Library was razed three years ago, county library officials 
said they anticipated opening a new branch by June, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 But first there was a problem with water hookups. Then the permitting process 
was delayed. Now library officials say they have selected a site on East 
Violeta Street, but need about $150,000 to complete the project, and they do 
not know when it will be completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've hit one roadblock after another," said Donna Roff, assistant manager of 
community libraries for the county. "It's very discouraging. Saticoy needs 
their library and we're doing the best we can." 
</P>
<P>
 The best is a small, austere, harshly lit meeting room in the Saticoy 
Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Tuesday and Thursday afternoons, librarian Evelyn Cuevas hauls out 
four book carts from storage and sets them up in the meeting room. 
</P>
<P>
 One cart has nonfiction books, one has fiction, one geared for children and 
the last cart is filled with Spanish books. Most of the library's volumes are 
in storage, and patrons have only about 1,000 books to choose from. The 
magazine selection is meager, bestsellers are scarce and few books on tape are 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Cuevas says "we have a little bit of everything here," she concedes 
that her library is not situated in the best of places. The room, which is 
about 700 square feet, has all the ambience of a hospital ward. 
</P>
<P>
 No posters or decorations are allowed on the white walls. No carpet or rugs 
are available for children to sit on during storytelling hour. No computer is 
handy for patrons to look up books. Also, the room frequently is poorly heated, 
Cuevas said, and few patrons stay very long. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very sterile," she said. "We can't put anything on the walls, so we try 
to decorate the carts." 
</P>
<P>
 The room's seven long white tables and numerous brown metal chairs do not 
appeal to her young patrons, Cuevas said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The children don't stay long to do their homework," she said. "We encourage 
them to stay, but many times they don't." 
</P>
<P>
 The Saticoy Library, one of the county's oldest, has been in existence since 
1919. At one time, there were two branches, which were consolidated into a 
single library in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 Library officials say the Saticoy branch has the smallest collection and the 
lowest circulation of any library in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the library moved to the community center last September, it was 
operated solely out of the bookmobile, a roving van that came to Saticoy Park 
two afternoons a week. 
</P>
<P>
 When the van broke down in July, two months passed before the library was 
moved to the community center. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuevas said the bookmobile offered a larger selection of books, and while she 
rotates different books on her carts, her patrons sometimes complain about 
reading the same books over and over. Most of the library's 8,000-volume 
collection is in storage, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be a lot bigger," said Jodi Bradley, who brought her 7-year-old son 
Jimmy to the tiny facility. "A lot of these books here are looking familiar. 
He'll go through them soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Vera Jetton, a longtime library patron, said part of the problem is that 
Saticoy residents have not been pestering their elected officials to get a 
permanent library faster. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a poor area, and I don't think the people here have contacted the 
politicians too much," Jetton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jetton said Saticoy in particular is in dire need of a larger library because 
many of the poorer residents do not have cars and cannot travel west to 
Ventura, where larger libraries are available. 
</P>
<P>
 Other libraries in the county have received attention after lobbying by 
elected officials and residents. The Ventura Avenue Library was on the verge of 
shutting down before a group of residents and the Ventura City Council 
persuaded library officials to let it remain open. Just two years ago, after 
heavy lobbying, Supervisor Vicky Howard got her fellow board members to approve 
an allocation of $260,000 in emergency funds to more than double the size of 
the Moorpark Library, which is in her district. 
</P>
<P>
 Jetton, president of the Parent-Teacher Assn. at Saticoy Elementary School, 
said her community has been overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time they say they're going to do something, they come up with an 
excuse not to do it," Jetton said. 
</P>
<P>
 But county library officials say the Saticoy Library is a high priority. They 
are applying for federal grants for the library, and are hopeful of getting a 
permanent site eventually, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a lease has been negotiated for the site on East Violeta Street, the 
library agency does not have the money to put in a parking lot, move a modular 
building to the site and install plumbing and utilities in the building, Roff 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big priority that we get it going," Roff said. "But we had a 
tremendous cut in budget and services all over." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Library Services Agency incurred $1.7 million in budget 
cuts this fiscal year. About 45 full-time employees and all 75 part-time 
workers received layoff notices, and all 16 libraries scaled back on staff 
members and number of hours open. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuevas, who has been the Saticoy librarian since 1985, said she is grateful at 
least to have a temporary facility to reach out to hungry young minds. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many patrons disappeared after the bookmobile broke down, they have 
gradually been finding the new site again, Cuevas said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not much, but at least it's something."

unit in the county prosecutor's office, Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury lists 
those groups as some of the targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury said he believes the unit has deterred local officials who might 
otherwise be tempted to peddle their influence. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you know there is a watchdog, honest people tend to remain honest," 
Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics, however, call the unit unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 They say public officials in Ventura County adhere to a high code of personal 
ethics and that time spent looking for corruption against them is not well 
spent. 
</P>
<P>
 "My experience in this county has been that I have not run into any evidence 
or instances of political corruption," said county Supervisor Maggie Kildee, 
adding political corruption should be investigated only when there is 
sufficient evidence that it exists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I personally have never been approached by someone with that as a 
politician," she said. "I'm simply not aware of that happening in this county." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Bradbury said he is glad he established the unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nice thing about this unit is it helps keep political figures out of 
trouble, and it smacks them when they step across the line," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury announced the formation of the political corruption unit last June. 
At the time, he said the unit had been formed four months earlier and started 
its work by conducting an inquiry into possible laundering of contributions by 
card club promoters to the Oxnard City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the new two-investigator unit would routinely analyze campaign and 
personal-finance documents filed by city officials and by holders of county and 
statewide offices. 
</P>
<P>
 And he added that the specially trained investigators would undertake a broad 
range of investigations, looking for corruption not only among politicians but 
in government-related transactions involving large amounts of money. 
</P>
<P>
 But -- after almost a year of operations -- there is evidence that the unit 
has had difficulty finding anyone to charge with political corruption crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Charges have been filed in only one case since the unit was created -- six 
misdemeanor counts of money laundering and one felony count of grand theft 
against two former promoters of a card-club casino in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 They broke state law by making small contributions indirectly to two Oxnard 
councilmen, one former councilwoman and an assemblyman, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the shortage of cases actually leading to charges, the unit has 
also been scaled back in size. Bradbury said he now has only one investigator 
-- not two -- assigned to political corruption investigations. And that 
investigator spends no more than "25% to 30%" of his time on such matters, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it would be wise or appropriate to devote a great deal of 
resources to something like this," Bradbury said. "On the other hand, it 
wouldn't be wise to ignore it." 
</P>
<P>
 Some public officials, especially those who consider the unit a luxury, said 
they are pleased to learn that the unit is not being touted as highly as in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would agree that we always need to be aware and look at any allegations 
that are raised," Kildee said. "But it would seem that in a time of limited 
resources, it wouldn't be my highest priority at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 Other politicians agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I know is that those people who I've associated with in the political 
arena in my short term in office I've found to be of great integrity," said 
Oxnard Councilman Andres Herrera, who was elected in November, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Others say Bradbury should not let up on political corruption investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Politics can and often does lead to corruption," Oxnard Councilman Michael 
Plisky said. "And I think the best prevention is just this kind of department. 
The presence of such a department may go a long way toward preventing any 
problems with political corruption." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Preventing problems before they occur is what the political corruption unit 
has been doing, its architect said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When unsavory individuals are courting public officials, we will let them 
know" about the person's background, Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said there have been several instances since formation of the 
unit that his office has persuaded local officials against dealing with 
organized crime figures. He would not say which local governments received the 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said his office was the first to alert Oxnard city officials that 
several people involved in last year's card-club proposal were convicted 
felons. 
</P>
<P>
 But the political corruption probe into the card-club promoters yielded 
charges against two promoters who had no criminal records -- Michael E. Wooten, 
45, of Camarillo and Frank Marasco, 48, of Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Each is charged with six misdemeanor counts of violating state law by making 
small contributions -- all less than $99 -- indirectly to two Oxnard 
councilmen, including Michael Plisky, who authorities say was unaware of the 
true source of the donations. 
</P>
<P>
 But the level of the charges against Wooten and Marasco -- misdemeanors 
instead of felonies -- has caused the defendants' supporters to claim Bradbury 
is prosecuting them to justify the resources used during the probe. 
</P>
<P>
 "He put a lot of time, energy and money into it, and didn't find anything," 
argued Richard C. Loy, Wooten's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "What did he uncover?" Loy asked. "Perhaps some technical violations of 
reporting. In any other jurisdiction in the land, this would have been handled 
civilly." 
</P>
<P>
 The defense has filed a motion in court, accusing the district attorney's 
office of prosecutorial indiscretion, Loy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means, 'Mr. Prosecutor, use some common sense here,' " he said of the 
motion. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis B. Samonsky Jr., Marasco's lawyer, was also incensed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that's the political corruption that exists in this county, then I don't 
know that there is a necessity to have a political corruption unit," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe how clean the politics are in this county, compared to the 
east coast -- where if you are stopped for a traffic ticket you hand the 
officer a $20 bill with your driver's license," said Samonsky, a native 
Pennsylvanian. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury agreed that Ventura County government officials generally are above 
suspicion. But he stands behind his prosecution of Wooten and Marasco, who are 
also charged with a felony count of grand theft unrelated to the contributions 
in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 In the felony case, prosecutors allege Wooten and Marasco -- co-owners of the 
defunct Darrik Marten Co. in Ventura -- submitted a false $10,000 construction 
voucher to a consortium of Ventura County investors in 1992, then used the 
money personally without telling the lender. 
</P>
<P>
 And Bradbury said the work of his political corruption unit goes beyond the 
charges filed against Wooten and Marasco. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County prosecutors initiated an ongoing FBI investigation into 
suspected double-billing by Lehrer McGovern Bovis, the nation's second-largest 
construction management firm, on projects including the $64-million performing 
arts center in Thousand Oaks, Bradbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury also said that his political corruption investigators were involved 
in obtaining search warrants in a bookmaking investigation that led last week 
to the suspension of some Inglewood police officers residing in Simi Valley. 
But Bradbury would not disclose details of that case. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury said the political corruption unit is important because Ventura 
County is a fast-growing community and the site of major development projects. 
He said even honest public officials can be tempted by the lure of making a 
fast buck. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County's political corruption unit is modeled after one in Orange 
County -- which has had a string of major political corruption cases during the 
last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County has four district attorney's investigators who devote about 50% 
of their time probing political corruption, said Chief Assistant Orange County 
Dist. Atty. Maurice Evans. 
</P>
<P>
 Evans said those investigators also routinely check campaign and personal 
finance records of public officials. But most of their cases are referred to 
them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, the public probably will never see the benefits of the new 
unit, Bradbury said. Most of its work is designed to head off problems before 
they occur, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury said investigating political corruption is not like investigating 
more routine crimes such as burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're blessed in this county with pretty honest political figures, so you are 
not going to see indictments charging mayors. . .and other political officials 
with crimes," he said.

QUAKE-DAMAGED FILLMORE HOME TORN DOWN; RECOVERY: OWNERS SALVAGE A FEW FINAL 
ITEMS FROM THE HOUSE. RED CROSS PLANS TO CLOSE A SHELTER IN SIMI VALLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The demolition of a quake-damaged home in Fillmore neared its end Saturday, 
while the American Red Cross prepared to close up shop at one of its two 
remaining county shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With a brooding sky overhead, workers made one final sweep through the 
Fillmore residence of Francis and Denise Beauduy, salvaging the last objects 
from a once-complete household before razing the two-story home by hand. 
</P>
<P>
 By Saturday afternoon, a demolition crew -- employing crowbars, ropes, 
pickaxes and brute strength -- had reduced the structure to a near skeleton. 
Wall panels were pried lose and parts of the roof were yanked down. Wood beams 
were salvaged when possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's crap," said a somber Denise Beauduy. "Your life is reduced to just 
crap." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the razing began, the Beauduys were handed a few belongings that 
remained -- a lamp, a ceiling fan and a few other mementos. 
</P>
<P>
 "Francis watched them take the front porch off and that was enough for him," 
Denise Beauduy said. Her husband could not stand to watch any further, she 
said, and he left soon after. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 14 structures citywide are set to be torn down, city officials 
said. Heavy equipment will be brought in starting Monday to knock down what is 
left of the Fillmore Hotel, some Central Avenue businesses and the historic 
Masonic building, constructed in 1919. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of history left in there still," said Ken Glenn, 78, president 
of the board for the Santa Paula-Fillmore Masonic Lodge. "There's one room we 
haven't gotten into yet that has several filing cabinets with lodge member 
records from as far back as 1906." 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts will be made to retrieve the records when the demolition begins. The 
wrecking crew is scheduled to start on the building Monday, Glenn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Emotions were more cheerful in Simi Valley, where the Red Cross made plans to 
tear down the city's temporary shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelters in Piru and at the Veteran's Memorial Building in Fillmore already 
have closed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley site has been at Hillside Junior High School since it was 
moved there from Royal High School a week after the quake.  
</P>
<P>
 At one point, 125 residents were lodged there, but by Saturday night, that 
number had dropped to 45, Red Cross officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We open the shelters to close them as soon as possible," said Gregory Smith, 
a mass-care coordinator for Ventura County Red Cross operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Once emergency centers open, Smith said, the family-service arm of the Red 
Cross steps in to plan long-term recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Family service helps them find another place or, once they find another 
place, they can provide them with bedding furniture, clothes and food. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ideally, the shelters are designed not to be opened for an extended time," 
Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The remaining 45 shelter residents will move to various locations, including 
motels, or join family and friends, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy it's coming to an end, but sad at the same time," said shelter 
manager Melissa Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you work as close with these people as I have -- hearing their stories 
-- you become very close. We're an extended family," the 43-year-old Moorpark 
resident said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelter residents were planning a party Saturday night to honor the Red Cross 
volunteers at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them not to do this, but that's what they wanted to do," Lawrence 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people have been real nice here," said Sylvia Milian, who, along with her 
11-member family, moved in when their Simi Valley house was deemed unsafe. "We 
feel very safe here, thanks to (the Red Cross volunteers.)" 
</P>
<P>
 Milian, 28, and her clan -- including children, brothers, sisters, parents and 
grandparents -- were told their home is now safe, but they remain hesitant to 
move back in. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very scary, having to leave the shelter," Milian said. "We may move back 
to Chicago." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 100 residents will continue to live at the last remaining county 
shelter at Fillmore Middle School for at least another week, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is lack of alternative housing in Fillmore," said Mike Goth, 
director of emergency services for the Ventura County chapter of the American 
Red Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 "There wasn't much before, and they're ain't a whole lot now," Goth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who traveled from San Francisco to help relief efforts, said Ventura 
County is well on the road to recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, I think the recovery here is going extremely well," he said. 
"But the real gauge is the fact we have closed three of the four shelters."

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; SUSPECTS SOUGHT IN CONDOMINIUM HEISTS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Port Hueneme police are searching for suspects in a series of daytime 
burglaries at three condominium complexes. 
</P>
<P>
 Since October, residents have reported about a dozen break-ins at the Harbor 
Lights, Marlboro by the Sea and Sandpiper Village developments.In each case, 
residences were entered after someone kicked in a front door that was shielded 
by a courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're using their feet," Officer Kenneth Dobbe said. "They just kick the 
door until it breaks the door frame and breaks the locks off." 
</P>
<P>
 The items most frequently stolen have been jewelry, VCRs and televisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators thought that they had the burglaries solved in early January, 
when they recovered stolen property and linked several burglaries to a man who 
was already in jail. But the break-ins have continued and police are searching 
for additional suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information on the burglaries is asked to call Crime Stoppers at 
986-TALK or 385-TALK. If the information leads to criminal charges, the tipster 
may be eligible for a cash reward. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people would just start calling us every time they see something 
suspicious, maybe something would come out of it," Dobbe said. JULIE FIELDS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VENTURA; LESSON THAT COUNTS TAKES KIDS BEYOND 99

<P>
 Unlike the end of the first 100 days of a new presidency, the 100th day of 
school normally passes without notice. 
</P>
<P>
 But E.P. Foster School in Ventura uses the anniversary as a tool for teaching 
its 580 kindergarten through fifth-grade students about the numerical value of 
100. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the 100th day of the 1993-94 school year, E.P. Foster students 
spent the entire day working on projects having to do with the number 100. 
</P>
<P>
 Some classes strung necklaces with 100 Cheerios, counting out the crunchy 
ornaments 10 pieces at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 Other students held 100-meter sprints. Some groups of children worked together 
on murals that included 100 illustrations. 
</P>
<P>
 And at the end of the day, all the school's students gathered on the 
playground for a grand finale, teacher Judy Neumann said. Eight-year-olds who 
were born 100 months ago in October, 1985, and students who have had perfect 
attendance during the first 100 days of school this year received balloons, 
which they all popped at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 One teacher donned a mask and cape and made an appearance as "Zero the Hero" 
to remind students of how zeros serve the important role of holding places in 
the decimal system. "When you write that number 100, the zeros have no value 
except to reserve that place," Neumann said. 
</P>
<P>
 And all E.P. Foster students counted backward from 100 in unison. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's another way to count," Neumann said. "It's another way to look at 100." 
</P>
<P>
 The activities on the concept 100 may be most useful to students in the second 
grade, who are learning for the first time to do double-digit addition and 
subtraction, she said. MAIA DAVIS

 A Newbury Park man was in critical condition Saturday evening after he fell 
from the Borchard Road overpass onto the Ventura Freeway and was struck by a 
car, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pushpanden (Peter) Dhillon, 36, of Newbury Park was seen hanging from the 
overpass about 12:20 p.m. Saturday, shortly before he fell into a southbound 
lane, according to the Ventura County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 A motorist told sheriff's deputies she saw Dhillon as he fell and she swerved 
but was unable to avoid hitting him. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic in the southbound lanes was stopped for about 30 minutes while Dhillon 
was treated by paramedics, officials said. He was then taken to St. 
John's-Pleasant Valley Hospital, where he was listed in critical condition late 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dhillon has multiple fractures to his legs, pelvis and ribs, a hospital 
spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not known if Dhillon intended to jump or if he fell accidentally, a 
sheriff's official said. MATTHEW MOSK

 A Simi Valley bank robber escaped with an undetermined amount of money 
Saturday morning, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man walked into HomeFed Bank at 2860 Cochran St. at 11:30 a.m., gave the 
teller a note and walked out with the cash, police said. At no time did he 
threaten anyone or show a weapon, according to Detective Bill Daniels. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniels said police and federal agents are looking into the possibility that 
the man has robbed other banks. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, described as 38 to 45 years old, wore a gray sweat suit and was last 
seen walking south through the parking lot outside HomeFed Bank. MATTHEW MOSK

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CABLE SHOW TO FOCUS ON THE COMMUNITY

<P>
 What motivates a senior citizen to volunteer to raise funds for social service 
groups? What compels a city councilman to spend hours poring over dense 
paperwork? What encourages an entrepreneur to sink her life savings into a 
start-up business? 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to answer such questions, Thousand Oaks resident Skip Lewerentz will 
launch a cable television show on the public access channel later this 
month.The weekly one-hour program will be called "Up Close and Personal." 
</P>
<P>
 Guests will include elected officials, business people and volunteers with 
various nonprofit community groups. After interviewing the guests, Lewerentz 
will invite call-in questions -- the more personal, the better. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to show (viewers) that, hey, these people are real," he said. "When 
you start seeing them on TV all the time (at City Council meetings), you get a 
different impression. Until I got to know them personally, I didn't like any of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewerentz, a projects manager at a local construction firm, said he hopes his 
call-in program will provide role models. He also wants to use the forum to 
publicly praise volunteers who "work their tails off for years and never get 
recognition." 
</P>
<P>
 The first show will air within three weeks, though Lewerentz has not settled 
on a firm date. He said "Up Close and Personal" will be broadcast on Channel 8 
from 4 to 5 p.m. Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Lewerentz has lined up one potential viewer -- Councilwoman Jaime 
Zukowski, who said she would appreciate more publicity for the volunteers who 
do vital work behind the scenes. STEPHANIE SIMON

 Less than one day after receiving approval, workers on Saturday began building 
a temporary Metrolink station in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials on the site of the planned station at Lewis Road and 
Ventura Boulevard called the cooperation between government and private 
industry remarkable. 
</P>

 "The ability to react in an emergency has been nothing short of amazing," said 
Joe Castro, manager of construction operations for Metrolink. "This kind of 
project would have normally taken months to complete." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Castro said trains should begin running from the station to downtown 
Los Angeles in just nine days, on Feb. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week officials from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Metrolink, the 
Ventura County Transportation Commission, Southern California Edison, GTE and 
chief contractor C.A. Rasmussen Inc. will all converge on the small plot of 
land to get the station up and running. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's wonderful seeing government and private industry working together and 
working quickly," said Paul Biere, the project manager for Rasmussen, the Simi 
Valley company that received the contract at 3:30 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame it took an earthquake to get things running so smoothly," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Biere said the station would include only the absolute necessities -- a 
platform, parking lot, telephone, ticket booth and tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Transportation Commission will decide in about 1 1/2 years 
whether to make the station permanent, Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only the weather could delay construction at this point, Biere said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we have rain, that would make this whole area a mud pit, and we would have 
to wait for it to dry out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters said there is a 70% to 80% chance of rain late today and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro said commuters from Camarillo will find the train an appealing 
alternative because of increased traffic on the Ventura Freeway following the 
partial closure of the Simi Valley Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "People don't want to deal with the frustration of the freeways since the 
earthquake," Castro said. "This is a quick and easy way to get into the Valley 
and downtown." 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink plans to run two trains from Camarillo each morning, stopping in 
Moorpark, Simi Valley, Chatsworth, Northridge, Van Nuys, Burbank, Glendale and 
Union Station in downtown Los Angeles. The planned schedule would have trains 
leave Camarillo at 5:45 and 6:35 a.m. and arrive in Los Angeles at 7:03 and 
7:54 a.m., Castro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trains, which can accommodate about 750 people each, would leave Los Angeles 
at 5:01 and 5:40 p.m. and arrive in Camarillo at 6:24 and 7:03 p.m., he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fare will be $12 round-trip between Camarillo and downtown L.A., said 
Ginger Gherardi, executive director of the Ventura County Transportation 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Jan. 17 earthquake, daily ridership on Metrolink trains in the Los 
Angeles area has surged from 8,100 to 19,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of the construction that began Saturday is estimated at $250,000, 
Biere said. Building and running the station are expected to cost about $1.9 
million over the next year, county officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Gherardi announced that the commission would pay the entire cost of 
the station if expected federal and state subsidies fall through. 
</P>
<P>
 An Army Corps of Engineers official at the construction site Saturday said his 
crew had been asked to assist in the operation by the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency. County officials said FEMA is expected to pay for about $1.3 
million of the project, while $500,000 would come from the California Office of 
Emergency Services. The rest is expected to come from the Ventura County 
Transportation Commission.

11 STARVING HORSES DONATED TO SHELTER; OJAI: THE OWNER OF THE ANIMALS WILL 
SUFFER NO PENALTIES AFTER AGREEING TO SIGN THEM OVER, ALONG WITH SEVEN OF 11 
CATS. 
</P>

<P>
 The owner of 11 starving horses found in the Lockwood Valley last month has 
agreed to donate them to the Humane Society shelter in Ojai, where they have 
been living since January, shelter Director Jolene Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Dist. Atty.Michael D. Bradbury and representatives from the 
Humane Society met with the horses' owner, 75-year-old Connie Warner, on 
Thursday and she agreed to donate the animals to the Ojai shelter, Hoffman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury's office referred requests for information about the case to Hoffman. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner has agreed to sign over 11 of the 14 horses and seven of the 11 cats 
found on her property during a Jan. 5 inspection, Hoffman said. Two horses died 
after being rescued. One horse and four cats will be returned to family 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 Three dogs that were also taken in the inspection will be returned to Warner 
because they were found in good condition, Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because she signed over the animals, nothing will happen to her," Hoffman 
said. "If she would not have, we would have turned the paperwork over to the 
D.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Warner refused to comment Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The horses are being fed three times daily to increase their weight, Hoffman 
said. She estimated that the first month of care cost more than $6,881, and the 
shelter will continue to house the horses for an additional six to nine months. 
</P>
<P>
 The Humane Society, a nonprofit organization funded by donations, has received 
$2,500 earmarked for the horses but needs more, Hoffman said. It also needs 
horse supplies, such as brushes, fly spray and hay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the food runs out and donations stop we're going to be in trouble," 
Hoffman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Donations should be sent to the Humane Society at 402 Bryant St., Ojai, 93023.

AN ANTIDOTE FOR THE POISON OF GOUGING; THE LAW IS ON THE SIDE OF CITIZENS 
AGAINST THOSE WHO WOULD EXPLOIT DISASTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A San Fernando Valley activist group has been visiting merchants suspected of 
price gouging after the Northridge quake. Leaders of VOICE, or Valley Organized 
in Community Efforts, ask the merchants to listen to the complaints of 
customers who feel they have been charged inordinately high prices. VOICE then 
demands that the shop owners sign a pledge agreeing to stop gouging. 
</P>
<P>
 Another way to proceed would be to involve local authorities and laws already 
on the books. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Willie Williams of the Los Angeles Police Department has already urged 
citizens to notify police immediately when they suspect they have been charged 
absurdly high prices for normally inexpensive items. That is one option. 
Another would make use of the fact that it is against the law in Los Angeles to 
increase the price of consumer goods, repair services and the like by more than 
10% above the prices that immediately preceded a declared state of emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 Such gouging is punishable by up to six months in jail and a $1,000 fine. You 
can report these matters to a quake-related task force for investigation at 
1-800-897-6677. 
</P>
<P>
 Quake victims whose homes have sustained damage are vulnerable to another kind 
of parasite. We refer to those who present themselves as honest, experienced 
and licensed contractors, but may be none of the above. 
</P>
<P>
 State contracting officials suggest the following rules of thumb: Always get 
three or four price estimates on quake-related repairs that must be made before 
you pay a dime to anyone. Also, you should demand to know the state license 
number of the contractors. If they refuse to give you one, tell them to take a 
hike. Finally, once you have their license numbers, call the state contractor 
hot line at 1-800-321-CSLB and they will tell you whether the contractor is 
indeed licensed with the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Suspected contractor fraud can also be reported to the Consumer Affairs 
Earthquake Fraud Hotline at 1-800-897-6677. 
</P>
<P>
 Several arrests have already been made in the aftermath of the quake for 
gouging and the like, including the case of an unlicensed contractor who was 
going to charge $1,000 for a roof repair that ultimately cost $50 to fix. 
Unlicensed contractors who attempt to do reconstruction work during a state of 
emergency are subject to up to three years in prison or a fine of as much as 
$10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Making use of such laws will keep the few price-gouging merchants out there in 
line and the fake contractors out of your wallet.

LOSS TO PACIFIC ALL TOO FAMILIAR FOR ANTEATERS; BIG WEST: THEY SHOOT POORLY 
EARLY, CLIMB BACK INTO IT, THEN MAKE ENOUGH MISTAKES TO FALL, 88-79. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Another game, another arena, another team, another loss. 
</P>
<P>
 What can you say? 
</P>
<P>
 "Not a whole lot," UC Irvine Coach Rod Baker admitted after the Anteaters lost 
their sixth in a row Saturday night. "The effort was pretty good, but in 
crucial situations, we just didn't make the plays." 
</P>
<P>
 So what else is new? 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine hung close to University of the Pacific during much of the first half 
and was six points down with six minutes to play. But the Anteaters gave up a 
couple of easy layups and took a couple of quick shots and succumbed again, 
88-79, in front of 4,571 at the Spanos Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific is 8-3 in the Big West, a half game behind New Mexico State (8-2), 
which lost to Utah State Saturday night. The Tigers, who haven't been in first 
place in the conference since 1979, are one point short of being 11-0 at home 
after losing in overtime to New Mexico State last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine (5-13, 2-8) got a school-record 10 three-pointers from Chris Brown, who 
made 11 of 20 shots and finished with 36 points. Brown surpassed Scott Brooks' 
1987 school record of nine three-pointers against Nevada Las Vegas and tied the 
Big West record of 10 set by Nevada Las Vegas' Freddie Banks in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the way I usually shoot, this is what I'm used to," said Brown, who 
made 130 three-pointers last season at Bakersfield College. "It's hard to 
celebrate, though, because we ended up with another 'L.' We're just having a 
lot of bad luck right now."' 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine's misfortunes began early Saturday night when point guard Lloyd Mumford 
and center DeForrest Boyer both got into foul trouble. Mumford, the team's 
leading scorer coming in, finished with only two points. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shots Lloyd got tonight were no different than the ones he got at Long 
Beach (when he scored 31)," Baker said. "I don't know what the difference was 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when he's in foul trouble, you get a very tentative human being. He wants 
to play, and play a certain way, and when he gets into foul trouble, he can't 
play like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine suffered from the same problems Saturday night that have contributed 
most heavily to its recent woes. It's a hit-and-miss game for the Anteaters: 
Their opponents hit, they miss. Pacific shot 54% from the floor and Irvine only 
39%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers got a big boost from forward Michael Jackson, the conference's 
leading scorer who had just eight points in the first meeting between the 
teams. Jackson made six of his first nine shots and finished with 27 points and 
seven rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't play as well tonight as we did (Thursday) against Fullerton, but 
that was probably our best game of the season," Tiger Coach Bob Thomason said. 
"But tonight we did the things we had to do to win. I think we gave up too many 
points, but they only shot 39%." 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific shot 61% in the first half and led at the intermission, 43-30. They 
had seven points off the fast break and six points off turnovers. Irvine had 
zeros in both categories, so there's your 13-point halftime margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who scored 25 in the second half, began netting long shots -- a couple 
of times he made them from two or three yards beyond the three-point arc -- and 
Irvine started to sneak back into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 When Brown was fouled on a three-point attempt and made all three free throws, 
the Anteaters trailed, 65-59, with 6:11 remaining. But Pacific's Glenn Griffin 
scored on a layup, was fouled and made the free throw. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine got a layup from Boyer, but on its next two possessions, Brown and 
Mumford took and missed three-point attempts before more than a couple of 
seconds had run off the shot clock. Then the Tigers made 12 of 14 free throws 
in the final 1 1/2 minutes to hang on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lloyd's was a bad shot, but with Chris at that point, it's hard to complain," 
Baker said. "I'd prefer we would show more patience on offense, but when Chris 
is feeling it like that . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown's magic touch wasn't enough, and the Anteaters are left feeling only 
numb.

TIMEOUT, LUCK RUN OUT ON CAL STATE FULLERTON; BASKETBALL: HOLLAND PUZZLED BY 
OFFICIALS' DECISION LATE IN 84-82 LOSS TO SAN JOSE STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James French's 15-foot jump shot with five seconds left bounced off the rim, 
but that wasn't what angered Cal State Fullerton Coach Brad Holland. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton went scoreless for 2 minutes 25 seconds down the stretch, but that 
wasn't what made Holland mad, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland's emotions were mixed after the Titans' 84-82 loss to San Jose State 
in a Big West Conference game Saturday night at the Event Center. 
</P>
<P>
 He was pleased with how the Titans (4-15, 2-9) played tough after losing 
consecutive road games at Long Beach State (by 22 points) and at Pacific (31 
points). 
</P>
<P>
 But he was disgusted with how the Titans had to scramble onto the court after 
a timeout with 1:03 remaining after the game official sat the ball down on an 
inbounds play and began running off the five-second count. The Titans trailed, 
83-82, at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Winston Peterson grabbed the ball and called a timeout, saving the 
possession but costing the Titans their final timeout. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland argued that the officials never gave the Titans a required warning to 
break their huddle. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to talk to the officials about that," Holland said. "You saw the 
game. You point out the particular plays and tell me what happened. I can't say 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (officials) are supposed to give us a warning (near the end of) the 
timeout. But no one from our staff heard from an official. Here we were, in the 
gut of a game ... you ask them (officials) that question." 
</P>
<P>
 That final timeout the Titans wasted would have come in handy when French got 
the ball with 12 seconds left and drove down the right side of the court. He 
pulled up from 15 feet on the right side, but his shot drew only iron. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I could have had a 10-footer because the defense sagged off me," 
French said. "I had a good look at the basket. It felt good when I went up, but 
when it left my hands, I knew it was short." 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose's Lossie Mitchel got the rebound and was fouled by Fullerton's David 
Frigout. Mitchel made one of two free-throw attempts to make it 84-82, and 
Fullerton's Danny Robinson was short on a desperation shot beyond half court at 
the buzzer. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some aspects, this game was tougher on us (than the Pacific loss)," French 
said. "We deserved to win this game. We gave a better effort." 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose (11-8, 7-4) swept the regular-season series with Fullerton for the 
first time since 1981. The Spartans beat the Titans, 69-63, two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton led, 40-34, after Frigout hit two free throws with 3:36 left in the 
first half. But the Spartans turned consecutive Robinson turnovers into 
three-pointers by Jason Allen and Mitchel, keying an 11-5 run that tied it, 
45-45, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans kept it close in the first four minutes of the second half, but San 
Jose pulled away with a 7-2 run sparked by a short jumper and a layup by 
leading scorer Terry Cannon. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose pushed its lead to nine, 67-58, after a dunk by Roy Hammonds with 
10:20 left. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fullerton kept chipping away at the deficit. David Little hit a 
three-pointer. Greg Vernon added two free throws. Fred Amos hit a free throw, 
and Vernon followed the miss. French hit a three-pointer to cut it to 73-72 
with 6:51 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton its first lead since early in the second half when Winston 
Peterson's layup with 3:16 left gave the Titans an 80-79 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Titans went scoreless for the next 2:25. Cannon intercepted a bad pass 
by Robinson, and Hammonds followed a Cannon miss to make it 83-80 with 1:45 
left. Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The men's game, scheduled for a 7:30 p.m. start, began 45 minutes behind 
schedule. Officials for the women's game were an hour late because of a 
typographical error on a Big West Conference schedule. The women's game was 
scheduled for a 5 p.m. start, but the schedule said 7:30 p.m. The game began at 
6, about 15 minutes after the officials arrived.

 For the third consecutive time this season, the Pirates beat Moorpark, this 
time by 94-82 in a Western State Conference North Division game Saturday night, 
to reinforce their No. 1 ranking in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't as easy as the final score might indicate. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark (20-8, 2-3 in conference play) sent its own thoroughbreds out and 
gave Ventura (29-1, 5-0) a run for its money. It was the 28th consecutive 
victory for Ventura, which beat the Raiders in a tournament game in November 
and on Jan. 24 in a conference game. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Moorpark) came out much more focused this game," Ventura Coach Philip 
Mathews said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders stayed in the race throughout but faltered in the last four 
minutes, when Ventura was able to pull away. 
</P>
<P>
 The score was tied, 79-79, after Ventura forward Steve Amar made the second of 
two free throws with 4 minutes 16 seconds remaining. Then the Pirates went on a 
10-2 run sparked by forward Brandon Jessie that iced the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessie scored seven of the 10 points in the rally, including four on offensive 
rebounds. He finished with 34 points and 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jessie played a great game," Nordquist said. "He made a big difference." 
</P>
<P>
 The teams took turns trying to build leads but neither could open much of a 
cushion. 
</P>
<P>
 The lead changed several times in the first half, with neither side ahead by 
more than five points until Moorpark pieced together a 7-2 run to take a 42-33 
advantage with 3:47 until intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura responded with a 9-0 spurt to even the score, 44-44, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates tightened their defense in the second half, particularly against 
Sean Martin, who finished with 23 points, 17 in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about shutting Martin down (in the second half)," Mathews said. "We 
put more pressure on him and the entire team." 
</P>
<P>
 With Martin not being able to find his shots, forward Danny Alexander stepped 
up and scored 11 of his 18 points. Forward Paul Foster, who was limited to four 
points in the first half, scored 10 for the Raiders in the final 20 minutes, 
but neither player could bring Moorpark all the way back. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates got 18 points from Amar in one of his best shooting nights of the 
season and 16 from point guard Joey Ramirez, who was playing with damaged 
cartilage in his right knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez, who was injured in Ventura's last game against Moorpark, will undergo 
arthroscopic surgery Monday and will miss 10 to 12 days, Mathews said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll replace him by committee," Mathews said.

CS NORTHRIDGE FINDS COMFORT IN SACRAMENTO; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: AMID 
FAMILIARITY, MATADORS DEFEAT HAPLESS HORNETS, 84-67, FOR FOURTH VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When a team hasn't played a game at home for as long as Cal State Northridge, 
it takes familiarity where it can be found. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Sacramento's gym is built similarly to Northridge's, and Saturday 
night it even further resembled the Matadors' home haunt. 
</P>
<P>
 Right there in the bleachers, cordoning off a reserved seating area, was 
yellow tape with black lettering that read: Crime Scene Do Not Cross. 
</P>
<P>
 Buildings have been Northridge draped in the stuff since the Jan. 17 
earthquake, and the Matadors seemed to take to the familiar surroundings, 
routing Sacramento, 84-67. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Andre Chevalier and getting a much-needed boost from Brent Lofton off 
the bench, Northridge turned a close game in a runaway in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors (4-14) were ahead by only five points with 12 minutes 22 seconds 
to play, but they blew the game open with a 15-1 run. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they caught us they hit two or three (three-point baskets)," Northridge 
guard Brooklyn McLinn said, "and they're a bunch of non-shootin' dudes, so I 
knew that wasn't going to keep going." 
</P>
<P>
 Right he was. After Vincent Stewart scored on a dunk to trim Northridge's lead 
to 50-45, the Hornets (1-20) missed their next 12 shots, going 8:39 without a 
field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge stayed in a zone for most of the game, content to let Sacramento 
fire from the perimeter. The strategy worked. The Hornets were five of 24 from 
three-point range and made six fewer field goals than the Matadors on 14 more 
attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevalier paced the Matadors with 21 points and seven assists as Northridge 
snapped a four-game losing streak and won its second road game of the season. 
Lofton scored 14 points on seven of eight shooting and grabbed nine rebounds in 
23 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 McLinn added 16 points for the Matadors, who led by as many as 25 late in the 
second half. McLinn, a senior, also had five steals and set a Northridge record 
for three-point baskets by sinking the 122nd of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge committed 23 turnovers, but Sacramento made 26, including several 
that were unforced. The Hornets did, however, hold a 43-38 rebounding edge, 
including a 22-10 margin on the offensive boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento held its own in the lane, but outside the Hornets were stone cold. 
Take away the five three-point baskets and Sacramento made only three shots 
from outside the paint. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors, as usual, tried a zone defense early. For one of the few times 
this season, it was consistently effective. Sacramento shot only 34.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were going to test the water with it and see what happened," Northridge 
Coach Pete Cassidy said. "It worked, so we stayed with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Damone Williams led the Hornets with 19 points. Michael Boyd, a freshman from 
Gardena, added 18 points. Williams, who made eight of 16 shots, was the only 
Sacramento player to shoot 50% or better. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Northridge had an unusually strong shooting night. The Matadors 
shot 52.5%, making slightly more than half of their attempts in each half. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not really too excited," Chevalier said. "We play Cal on Monday. If we 
beat them, you'll see happiness then."

OKENWA ENABLES MASTER'S TO CONTINUE ROLL

<P>
 It has not happened often this season, but Saturday night The Master's College 
rode the broad shoulders of Emeka Okenwa to an 84-75 victory over Biola in a 
nonconference men's basketball game. 
</P>
<P>
 Okenwa, a 6-foot-7, 230-pound center from Owerri, Nigeria, scored 24 points -- 
including 16 in the second half -- as the Mustangs won their 11th consecutive 
game and their 19th in the last 20 before a partisan, standing-room only crowd 
of 1,400. 
</P>
<P>
 Okenwa scored 14 of the final 25 points for Master's, including nine of the 
last 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a credit to this team that we've had a lot of different guys step up for 
us this season," Master's Coach Bill Oates said. "And tonight, Emeka just took 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 Master's (22-3) was clinging to a 73-69 lead with 2 1/2 minutes to play when 
Okenwa made a series of moves. 
</P>
<P>
 He hit a pair of free throws with 2:32 left to give the Mustangs a six-point 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 He added two more 19 seconds later to give them a 77-69 advantage, and 
following a basket by Biola's Chris Sandahl, he made another two free throws to 
give Master's a 79-71 edge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles (18-9) narrowed the deficit to 79-75 with 38 seconds to play, but 
Okenwa rebounded a missed free throw by Andy Thompson with 36 seconds 
remaining, scored on the put-back and converted the free throw after being 
fouled by Johnny Debbs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because they were playing behind me, I had a chance to get the ball and turn 
to shoot," Okenwa said. "To beat Biola is big for us. It's fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Master's had a 57-45 lead midway through the second half, but Biola went on a 
18-10 run to narrow its deficit to 67-63 with 5:23 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Five different players scored points during the run for the Eagles, who were 
led by Debbs with 22 in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 James Mosley scored 17 points for Master's and Doug Leaman added 13 as Oates 
chalked up his 620th victory during a coaching career that has included stints 
at the high school, junior college, NCAA Division I, international (Athletes in 
Action) and now NAIA level. 
</P>
<P>
 Master's led, 41-28, at halftime as Okenwa hit a fall-away 14-foot jumper with 
two seconds remaining to give the Mustangs their biggest lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Okenwa was one of three Master's players who scored eight points in the half. 
Thompson, the point guard, and Mosley, a forward, were the others. 
</P>
<P>
 Biola was led by Debbs, a 6-7 left-hander from Phoenix, who scored 11 points 
in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Biola scored the first basket, but Master's did not trail again, scoring on 
nine of its next 10 possessions to take a 19-9 lead with 11:19 left in the 
half.

MOVIES; HE'S BAD, BUT NOT TO THE BONE; MICHAEL MADSEN DOESN'T REALLY WANT TO 
MAKE A CAREER OUT OF PLAYING CRAZED KILLERS -- HE HELPED FREE WILLY, REMEMBER? 
BUT HE'S SO GOOD AT BEING "BAD" THAT IT JUST KEEPS HAPPENING. (AND HE DOES 
ENJOY IT.)

<P>
 "I think I'm a leading man in a bad guy's body," jokes actor Michael Madsen, 
clearly aware of the tough-guy persona he's developed since he delivered the 
performance everybody remembers from Quentin Tarantino's critically acclaimed 
low-budget thriller, "Reservoir Dogs." Madsen played Mr. Blonde, the cool 
killer who casually slices the ear off a bound and gagged police officer while 
prancing around to Stealer's Wheel oddball '70s hit, "Stuck in the Middle With 
You." It was a horrifyingly convincing performance, but the 35-year-old actor 
is determined to prove he can do other things than play the heavy. 
</P>
<P>
 Toward that end, he took the role of sensitive dad Glen Greenwood in last 
year's surprise box-office hit, "Free Willy," the story of a killer whale and 
the troubled kid who befriends him. Madsen looked surprisingly at home tossing 
a football with 12-year-old actor Jason James Richter, who played his foster 
son in the film, but it didn't take long for him to trade the football back in 
for a gun. Madsen recently completed work on Lawrence Kasdan's "Wyatt Earp," a 
Western epic slated for release on July 4, which finds him cast as Wyatt's 
older brother Virgil (Kevin Costner has the lead in the film). Madsen is also 
prominently featured in Roger Donaldson's "The Getaway," which opens Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Getaway" is a remake of the 1972 Sam Peckinpah chase picture that starred 
Steve McQueen and Ali MacGraw, which was based on a book by pulp novelist Jim 
Thompson. Donaldson's version features Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger as lovers 
on the run from the law as they struggle to extricate themselves from a life of 
crime. Madsen turns up here as Rudy, a sociopathic killer who pulls a heist 
with the couple, then proceeds to double-cross everybody within firing 
distance. So ferocious is his performance that Madsen is going to need to do 
some major back-peddling in order to persuade anybody he's not the most 
dangerous actor in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting with Madsen at a Beverly Hills restaurant, one encounters a man who 
both lives up to his reputation as a ruffian, yet is unexpectedly cordial and 
accessible. Dressed in motorcycle boots and a leather jacket, he has a few 
beers and several cigarettes for lunch, and talks in a hoarse whisper that's 
vintage Brando. A few minutes are spent discussing the finer points of tattoos 
-- Madsen has several quite beautiful ones, including the Harley-Davidson logo 
on one biceps, and his wife's name (Jeannine) on the other -- and when the 
conversation drifts to literature Madsen remains perfectly in character and 
names Charles Bukowski as his favorite author. 
</P>
<P>
 When one points out that guns have figured prominently in most of his films 
and asks if he owns any himself, he says, "Sure, I have a few guns -- I've used 
them, too, because I've been in life-threatening situations. There's a lot of 
bad men out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, Madsen's been around the block, but he's not 100% muscle. "I'm shy," he 
confesses, "and I'm not the kind of guy who wants to be at a party with a lot 
of people because I prefer being an observer to being a participant. I've 
always been a loner," he adds. "We could sit here and talk for hours and you 
could leave knowing absolutely nothing about me." 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to say exactly what Madsen might be hiding, but some who've 
succeeded in penetrating whatever defenses he has erected around himself insist 
he's one of the nicest guys in the business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael's quite sentimental but he doesn't want people to know that, and I 
find that a very endearing thing about him," says "Wyatt Earp" director 
Lawrence Kasdan. "He's a tough guy with a soft heart, and he and I connected 
immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin concurs: "Michael's a very special guy, and I grew to love him over 
the course of making 'The Getaway' -- he's absolutely amazing in the film too. 
To play the part of Rudy you have to be able to convey that you're really 
capable of hurting somebody, and Michael can do that with next to no effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of a shame he's such a convincing bad guy because he's capable of 
doing a lot of different things, and Hollywood rarely lets an actor break out 
of the typecasting that gets laid on them," Baldwin adds. "Hollywood isn't the 
greatest place in the world to have a career that revolves around 
self-expression, and I think Michael should make some money, then go back to 
Chicago and do a play. I'd love to see him on stage -- he'd probably be one of 
the greatest actors we've seen, because he's just the right amount of crazy." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 It was in Chicago, in fact, that Madsen's crazy quotient began percolating. 
Born there in 1958, the middle of three children (actress Virginia Madsen is 
his younger sister), Madsen recalls being attracted to movies, and to extremes 
of human experience, from a young age. 
</P>
<P>
 "My childhood was chaotic and diversified," Madsen flatly declares. "My 
parents split up when I was 9 and after that we never lived in the same place 
for more than a year because we didn't have much money and my mother had to 
work two jobs (Madsen's mother is a writer and producer who currently lives in 
Los Angeles). I suppose I was a juvenile delinquent, and that was probably 
because I was always the new kid in school coming in at the middle of the year, 
so I tended to hang out with the outsiders, underdogs and losers. They were 
more interesting to me and I never fit in with the privileged-people scene, so 
I wound up getting in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother introduced me to Kerouac, Henry Miller, Hemingway and Van Gogh, and 
my father, who was a Chicago fireman for 30 years, introduced me to people who 
were burned alive and run over by trains. My father's work exposed me to a very 
violent aspect of life, and maybe that's where I first got a taste for danger. 
I remember jumping off roofs and getting into fights from a very young age, so 
it's hard to say exactly where that came from. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I wasn't outside tearing up in the neighborhood, I was home watching old 
movies on TV," he continues. "I was a big Humphrey Bogart fan when I was 
little, and I also remember being totally knocked out by this Robert Mitchum 
movie, 'Heaven Knows, Mr. Allison.' Kirk Douglas' film 'Lonely Are the Brave' 
was also a big favorite of mine -- it was those two films that got me thinking 
acting might be something I was interested in doing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The films Madsen admired as a child left an imprint on him that is clearly 
apparent to those who have followed his work. In fact, it was Madsen's 
evocation of an acting style that dominated American movies in the '40s and 
'50s that led Tarantino to cast him in "Reservoir Dogs." 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael's a throwback to a breed of actor that includes people like Robert 
Mitchum, Aldo Ray and Lee Marvin," says Tarantino. "Many actors of that 
generation had been in World War II and they'd seen life, and most actors today 
can't fill their shoes -- Harvey Keitel, Sean Penn and Larry Fishburne are the 
only ones I can think of who have that kind of weight, and Michael has it in 
spades. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael has all these weird mannerisms," he adds, "and in the process of 
making 'Reservoir Dogs' I just fell in love with them. In the course of a short 
conversation he'll pick at his thumb, then he'll rub his eyebrow, bring his 
finger down his nose and drag it across his lip, then he'll stick his finger in 
his ear and scratch his neck. It's classic Method actor stuff, but having 
gotten to know Michael I can tell you these aren't affectations -- this is 
genuinely who he is." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Madsen was enchanted by movies from an early age, it wasn't until he 
was 20 that he began to seriously pursue acting. "I was working as an auto 
mechanic and I went with a friend to meet some girls at the Steppenwolf 
Theater," says Madsen, who was considering becoming a cop at the time. "The 
girls stood us up, but I saw 'Of Mice and Men' with John Malkovich, and wound 
up taking a scene study class with him for a few months -- I didn't get the 
idea of studying acting, though. I figured if you can do it, then you do it, 
and if you can't, then you don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Madsen may have been indifferent to acting classes but he was excited by the 
work itself, and in 1983 he landed a small part in "War Games" that brought him 
to L.A. "When I first got here I didn't know anyone in L.A., I worked in a gas 
station in Beverly Hills for nine months, and was living in an apartment at 
Western and Franklin," recalls Madsen. "I had a '65 Cadillac with a smashed 
door that I drove around town in, and I spent most of my time chasing girls, 
auditioning for parts, working on my motorcycle and meeting people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very idealistic about the life of an actor then, but that changed 
dramatically because my idealism was subjected to a major reality check early 
on," he continues. "What happened was, I'd done a pilot for a TV series based 
on Barry Levinson's film 'Diner' -- I was cast as Boogie, the character played 
by Mickey Rourke in the film -- and that led to a small part in Levinson's next 
film, 'The Natural.' I was 23 at the time and had a couple of big scenes with 
Robert Redford that I think I handled pretty well, but when the film came out 
and I went to see it I'd been completely cut. Nobody had the dignity, honesty 
or respect to let me know, and in the long run that was a good thing because it 
was a slap in the face that wised me up fast to what this business is really 
like." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bloodied but unbowed, Madsen pressed on, briefly marrying in his mid-20s (to 
Cher's sister, Georganne LaPiere), and landing small parts in more than a dozen 
films that prepped him for the second lead in John Dahl's 1989 film, "Kill Me 
Again." Cast as a psychotic killer, Madsen was allowed to stretch out and 
really show what he could do onscreen for the first time -- and the main thing 
he proved was that he could more than hold his own in a milieu of cinematic 
violence. It was this performance that led Tarantino to cast him in "Reservoir 
Dogs," a film that's been taken to task by many for its over-the-top violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, 'Reservoir Dogs' is violent, but it's a subliminal film and you have to 
look below its surface," Madsen points out. "It's actually a film about men 
trusting each other and the price they pay for doing that, and the violence is 
simply a catalyst for getting into this theme. You couldn't have this bunch of 
men dancing together to 'The Nutcracker,' because when we stopped dancing, 
who'd give a damn what we said to each other? Everybody responds to violence 
because it's a very real part of life. I've seen a lot of violence in my life 
and it's not something I have to pretend to know about, because I've been in 
trouble in my life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Performing in a violent film does take a toll on your psyche," he admits, 
"and that's easy to forget when you're working because it has a cumulative 
effect. It sinks progressively deeper into you as you're making the picture, 
then when it's over you suddenly find yourself with a weird personality you 
can't get rid of for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I didn't want to do 'The Getaway' because the 'Reservoir Dogs' thing 
was hanging on me and I didn't want to play any heavies for a while, but 
ultimately I couldn't resist," he says of the role of Rudy, which was played by 
Al Lettieri in the Peckinpah original. "It's fun to play a character like this 
because it's a part that has no boundaries, and the crazier you are the better. 
I don't think it's ever a good idea to play a character with just one color, 
though, so I tried to bring a lighter touch to Rudy. If you're gonna play 
somebody really demonic you've got to have some humor." 
</P>
<P>
 The most ingenious bit of shading Madsen brings to the part is the fact that 
he cradles a kitten in his arms in several scenes -- a kitten who purrs 
contentedly, and appears to be in heaven lounging about on the chest of the 
psychopathic Rudy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cat is a great detail for the character," says director Roger Donaldson, 
"but it also created difficulties because it's hard to act when you're worrying 
about which way a cat is looking. There were several great takes that didn't 
make the movie because the cat is looking in the wrong direction -- luckily the 
cat really took to Michael and was prepared to sit there for long periods." 
</P>
<P>
 The cat -- who goes by the name "Kitty" in the film -- does add a perverse bit 
of whimsy to Madsen's character, but his performance is nonetheless savage and 
disturbing. That may be why one senses a trace of relief in Madsen's voice when 
he reports that Kasdan's "Wyatt Earp" "isn't a violent film -- it's a 
historically accurate account of 30 years in the lives of the Earp brothers. 
There's killing, sure, because killing was part of the world these men lived 
in, but it's not like 'Rambo' killing. It's a film about the Old West, which 
was a hard place to live -- just like L.A. now," he laughs. "I wish I had a 
couple of brothers like the Earps." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When he's in L.A. between jobs, Madsen says he pretty much keeps to himself. 
Currently separated from his second wife, Jeannine Bisignano, with whom he has 
a 4-year-old son, Christian, Madsen says that the worst thing about an acting 
career is that "it makes it impossible to have a stable personal life because 
other people find it hard to be comfortably involved in your lifestyle. I'm 
happy when I'm working on a film, but whenever I return from a location the 
neat little package I'd tied my life up into when I left has come undone. You 
always come home to a big mess, so I tend to go into a cocoon when I'm not 
working and just want to sleep all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if I've resigned myself to the fact that I'll always have a 
chaotic personal life as long as I'm an actor, but it seems like I can't get 
away from that, because I've tried. I'm not frivolous and it's not like 'This 
ain't working out, so screw you, baby' -- I've tried to hang in there and do 
the right thing, but sometimes you don't get much cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you do this kind of work, a lot of people throw themselves at you and 
that's why I'm glad it took a while for whatever success I'm having to come to 
me," he concludes. "If all this had happened when I was 22 I probably would've 
gotten into some bad trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 When one points out that it's never too late for that, Madsen laughs and says 
"yeah, I know -- I'm in trouble right now."

ART; LISTENING TO THE MILITANT MUSE; THE STREETS ARE DANIEL MARTINEZ'S GALLERY. 
HE LOVES TO MAKE WAVES ABOUT PROBLEMS THAT ARE MAKING WAVES FOR OTHER PEOPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX BENAVIDEZ, Max Benavidez is a writer and critic based in Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I am an extreme person," asserts Daniel J. Martinez. Not missing a beat, he 
adds, "If I hadn't been an artist, I would have been a terrorist." 
</P>
<P>
 And maybe he would. Certainly the Los Angeles-based artist takes himself and 
his artwork seriously enough for the role. Like an uncompromising guerrilla 
bent on justice at any cost, Martinez is mad and wants everybody to know it. 
Without apology, he manipulates aesthetics and mixes mediums to make a social 
or political point. He typically opts for colossal scale and inevitably vents 
his wrath against the inequities of this postmodern, high-tech, paranoid 
culture. 
</P>
<P>
 If nonstop exposure is any measure of talent, then Martinez is very good at 
what he does. Within the last few years, his art of rage has been seen in 
venues no less impressive than Seattle's 1991 "In Public" series, last year's 
prestigious and controversial Whitney Biennial in New York, the 1993 Venice 
Biennale and last summer's watershed public art exhibition "Culture in Action" 
in Chicago. Each time he has managed to command both public attention and 
critical debate. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Martinez stirs up trouble just about everywhere he goes. His 
installation at Cornell University last year was vandalized by white 
supremacists. That attack led, in turn, to an impassioned demonstration by 
Latino students. His banners in Seattle sparked a rancorous debate on the very 
nature of art that went all the way to the front page of the city's major 
newspaper. Even the museum tags he created for the 1993 Whitney Biennial 
reading "I Can't Imagine Ever Wanting to Be White," were ultimately taken to be 
mean-spirited symbols of multicultural dogmatism. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez has created a high volume of disquieting work in a relatively short 
time, and it has earned him dual-edged critical recognition. Newsweek magazine 
recently named him American art's hot "new face" for 1994, calling his Whitney 
tags "the sharpest thorn" at the show. Meanwhile, when asked for this article 
what he thought of the tags, Time magazine art critic Robert Hughes called them 
a "cute one-liner of zero aesthetic value." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the critics think, Martinez has managed to gain a foothold in the art 
world. He is a quintessential hybrid artist who crosses disciplines, mixes 
technologies, applies theories and appropriates disparate elements from the 
tangled web of postmodern society. Simultaneously, he is a construct, an angry 
decolonized individual who has made himself over from the fragments of his 
original culture and the debris of postindustrial society. In many ways, he 
embodies a migrant nomadism, an exilic and oppositional sensibility moving 
subversively through our cool, digitized culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he now identifies himself as a Chicano, the 36-year-old Martinez is a 
classic study of the colonized Mexican American. Growing up in the 
working-class city of Lennox (near Los Angeles International Airport), he never 
learned to speak Spanish. Although both his parents were fluent, they spoke 
only English with him and, he says, "Spanish was strictly forbidden by my 
teachers." By his account, he never learned anything positive about his ethnic 
background. So, like many of his generation, he just drifted into an unthinking 
identification with "whiteness." 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting on that period, he says: "The orientation of my world was toward 
whiteness. Mexican music was not played in my household. Spanish was never 
spoken. For me, white meant better. It meant privilege." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he graduated from high school, Martinez knew he wanted to be an 
artist: "I wanted to learn about the art world and what it meant to actually be 
part of it. So I applied to every art school in the country, and I was rejected 
by every art school in the country. Finally, the only place left to try was 
CalArts," which was where he ended up. 
</P>
<P>
 But art school wasn't what he expected. In his mind, it would be a place of 
creative exchange. Instead, he found it to be a continuation of the prejudiced 
education he felt he had received all his life. "Even there, I was looked down 
on by others. On the surface the place seems open, but it's as alienating and 
racist as anywhere else," he claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps that's where Martinez's irrepressible urge to expose the ugliest 
truths took root. Even before graduating in 1979, Martinez began a long, 
intense series of what he calls "aesthetic investigations." 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked through several art forms," he explains, "searching for that form 
that would carry the content. I found myself dissatisfied with the object in 
the gallery. So I started to combine forms, to collaborate with other artists, 
with whole communities. This finally led to where I'm at now: large-scale 
interventions into public landscapes." 
</P>
<P>
 During that molting period in the the early '80s, he fell in with Harry Gamboa 
Jr. and ASCO (Spanish for nausea), a Chicano art group based in East Los 
Angeles. ASCO's work was infused with social commentary and a cutting sardonic 
edge. A master of appropriation, Martinez recognized the power in this 
specialized ethnic aesthetic and began reinventing it. 
</P>
<P>
 He also worked with local performance artists and often stayed up until dawn 
discussing political theory with radical academics. He earned money working as 
a free-lance photographer and stole whatever free time he could to read: 
existentialist Albert Camus, Italian Futurist manifestoes, Michel Foucault and 
even '60s Situationist tracts. 
</P>
<P>
 As his universe of conceptual reference points expanded, his anger continued 
to brew. He was in training, "arming myself with a philosophical position, a 
base of thought. Once that foundation was grounded, I could move anywhere I 
wanted to go." 
</P>
<P>
 By the early '90s, it all began to come together. His 1992 show, "I Pissed on 
the Man Who Called Me a Dog," opened at New Langton Arts in San Francisco. It 
exemplified all the basic elements of Martinez's world view. An especially 
angry, almost rabid installation, the work was a claustrophobic labyrinth 
strewn with old clothes and cardboard boxes that reeked of mildew. A shrieking 
soundtrack of deranged gospel music played in the background while 
strategically placed video monitors ran endless loops of violence excerpted 
from film, cartoons and other sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The installation also presented several photographs superimposed with quotes 
from famous thinkers. One piece depicted a grisly atrocity from the Bosnian 
war. Over it was Aristotle's dictum: "Anyone can become angry -- that is easy. 
But to be angry with the right person, to the right degree, at the right time, 
for the right purpose and in the right way -- that is not easy." Aristotle's 
words could well be Martinez's motto. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, insult is a through line in his work. Every installation becomes 
another opportunity to agitate, another chance to deliver a well-deserved punch 
into the gut of mainstream America. In the process, Martinez joins with other 
artists whose work only succeeds to the extent that it offends 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to get to people," Martinez says. "So, to be successful by the 
standard I've set for myself, the work must go straight to the core of the 
issue and deliver a deathblow. Anything less would be just empty posturing." 
</P>
<P>
 In his installation for the 1993 Venice Biennale, "Big Bad Wolf," Martinez 
offended his Italian hosts by including grisaille paintings on black velvet, 
each one depicting members of Italy's most notorious terrorist group. One 
writer in the journal Art in America said that Martinez's work represented the 
"strongest current of honest anger" in the show. The whole installation was 
imbued with a "sense of suppressed aggression." 
</P>
<P>
 That's Martinez's forte: He apprehends the anger of a place -- political, 
social or personal. Then, he turns the intangible emotions into palpable 
artworks. 
</P>
<P>
 His long journey into ethnic self-awareness makes the lapel buttons he did for 
last year's Whitney Biennial a lesson in high irony. As he says, "The buttons 
were open to multiple readings. White people thought it was reverse racism. 
People of color thought it was funny. For me, personally, the buttons were 
something else again. Even though I once tried to be white, I have now reached 
the point where I can't imagine ever wanting to be white." The tags incensed a 
great many patrons and reviewers. The buttons pushed a button, and they became 
emblems of the mainstream art world's disdain for multiculturalism. 
</P>
<P>
 He struck a nerve once again when he built the outdoor installation "The 
Castle Is Burning" last fall at Cornell University. When a giant black asterisk 
of particle board started going up on campus, Ithaca's pristine Ivy League 
community was told that the panels that composed the asterisk were a behavioral 
science experiment. In actuality, they were the building blocks of his 
installation, part of "Revelaciones/Revelations: Hispanic Art of Evanescence," 
the first Latino site-specific exhibition in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez selected the Arts Quad as his site, he says, precisely because "it is 
the most beautiful place on campus. It is the view, and that is directly 
related to privilege. It's about the whole notion of beauty and who has the 
privilege of having the beautiful view." 
</P>
<P>
 To further punctuate his point, Martinez placed red Styrofoam letters on top 
of the asterisk. Hovering high above ground they cut through the landscape with 
sayings such as this one from Diogenes: "In the rich man's house, the only 
place to spit is in his face." 
</P>
<P>
 These colossal billboards of contempt functioned as both sculpture and 
painting. The asterisk's panels, with their luxuriant, almost velvety, black 
fields could have been abstract canvases from the '60s. The pitch-covered 
boards and the razor-thin slits that cut horizontally across them also 
suggested modernist sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
 But the work was never taken seriously on its own terms. Many on campus saw it 
as nothing more than a nasty jab at Cornell's hallowed traditions. The student 
newspaper called it "non-art" and a "monstrosity." By the time the show opened, 
vandals had spray-painted a swastika and vulgar racial epithets all over the 
piece. Although the university president eventually condemned the racist 
graffiti, Latino and other minority students occupied the administration 
building for four days to protest campus intolerance. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back on the dispute, Chon Noriega, co-curator of the show and a 
professor at UCLA's School of TV and Film, claims that "the piece made manifest 
all the conflicts hidden by the Ivy League facade. It exposed the hypocrisy of 
a place that hides behind the notion of beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what Martinez does best," Noriega maintains. "He peels back the outer 
skin and shows the worst of what lies just beneath the surface. And then he's 
on to the next project. 
</P>
<P>
 "Daniel is a nomad," Noriega continues with a tone of both respect and 
cultural pity. "I don't think he has ties to any particular, localized 
community. He flies into a place and gets a sense of it. He dissects it and 
pinpoints its soft underbelly. He then presses down on its most sensitive 
pressure points. He's a catalyst." 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall of 1991, Martinez played a similar role in Seattle. Commissioned 
to create street banners to commemorate the opening of the Seattle Art Museum, 
he used the medium to question the city's social reality. Calling it "The 
Quality of Life," he fabricated two-sided banners based on the idea of 
society's haves and have-nots. 
</P>
<P>
 The black-and-white banners were Spartan, almost grim. The "have" sides asked 
such questions as "Do you have a beach house or a mountain house?" The other 
side read: "Do you have a place to live?" 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the banners went up, the local retail business association was 
outraged. In a letter to the Arts Commission, they said they had been led to 
believe that the "banners would be colorful, cheerful and enjoyable . . . ." 
Instead, the letter complained, "they were sociopolitical messages." The 
Seattle Times ran a front-page story and photo as well as an editorial 
condemning the flags as false art. 
</P>
<P>
 For Martinez, that was the point. "Art is an encounter," he says. "My work 
stimulates people to ask questions and re-examine their role in society. The 
real question in the Seattle situation wasn't whether or not my work was really 
art. The real question was control. Do business interests own all the avenues 
of discourse in a retail core, or can artists contribute?" 
</P>
<P>
 Besides drawing the whole city into a debate about art, his Seattle project 
caught the attention of one of America's most innovative curators, Mary Jane 
Jacobs. "What I saw in his work," she says, "was a real consideration for his 
audience. I was drawn to that. In the past, audience was a given -- there were 
patrons, dealers, collectors, museums. But now, in a post-studio reality, work 
that matters is much more audience-specific. Artists now ask: 'Who is it for?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 In late 1991, Jacobs approached Martinez about being part of a new public arts 
project sponsored by Sculpture Chicago that would take an audience-specific, 
non-institutional approach. Their collaboration was so natural that she took 
the project's title, "Culture in Action," from a presentation he had made to a 
Mexican American group. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Martinez spent two years working on a twofold Chicago project. 
An assistant professor in the Department of Studio Art at UC Irvine, he would 
leave for Illinois every Thursday night to spend the next four days working 
with community organizations in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 One result was "100 Victories/10,000 Tears," an installation that moved giant 
concrete blocks (from a building the University of Illinois was literally 
deconstructing) to a nearby university site that had been the locus of labor 
protests during the 19th Century. Using these discarded building blocks, 
Martinez created an "alternative university" space. 
</P>
<P>
 The second part of his project, "Consequences of a Gesture," (in collaboration 
with Vinzula Kara) was, as Martinez describes it, an "absurdist parade, 
carnival and spectacle." The procession, which took place last June, involved 
800 marchers from Mexican American and African American communities. The artist 
explains that at least one of the goals of the project was to generate a 
community "intervention" that would allow the audience to displace art objects 
as the central element of work. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next two years Martinez will show his work -- in one form or another 
-- in Dublin, Moscow, Pittsburgh, San Francisco, Venezuela, Saskatchewan and 
Riverside. Through it all, Martinez says he's ultimately driven by the fervent 
desire to make art part of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Otherwise," he says, "why make it during these times of crisis? Is it worth 
our effort and energy if it can't be part of real life and affect us in some 
way? The answer is no."

CRANK UP THE COLORS; ARMED WITH BLAZING SIX-STRINGS AND SUPER POWER AMPS,

 For generations, rock 'n' rollers have dreamed of being the Beatles or Stones. 
But now some of them are trying to out-muscle Batman and Superman. 
</P>
<P>
 No, Metallica hasn't started wearing capes and Ozzy Osbourne can't leap tall 
buildings in a single bound, but they've each got the one thing that certifies 
super-hero status: their own comic book. 
</P>
<P>
 In an ambitious appeal to rock fans and comic fans alike, the first four 
issues of Rock-It Comix have swooped upon comic book shops, music stores and 
newsstands. The magazine-size books are the newest series from Westlake 
Village-based Malibu Comics. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the company's non-rock comics take place in an "Ultraverse" populated 
by well-muscled heroes with names like Sludge and Firearm, as well as fiendish 
villains such as Bloodbath and Bruut. Rock-It stories are more likely to begin 
on a tour bus, and might describe the adventures of a wailing guitarist beset 
by fiendish censors. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first batch of rock comics, the exploits of Metallica, Ozzy and metal 
queen Lita Ford are all detailed in explosive, full-color artwork, while the 
story of upstart record company World Domination is told with striking 
black-and-white paintings. 
</P>
<P>
 The current release of the first four titles gives Rock-It its kick-off, and 
monthly releases are now planned throughout 1994. Metallica's historical 
retrospective will be spun through three special issues, with Part Two coming 
in March. A Black Sabbath book is scheduled for release this month, with a 
Megadeth book also coming in March. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, nearly 30 bands have become interested in working with Rock-It, and 
confirmed forthcoming titles will cover such diverse acts as Santana, Pantera, 
Pharcyde, the Doors, Yes, PM Dawn and the Lemonheads. Many groups have provided 
exclusive photos and interviews to for their comic sagas. 
</P>
<P>
 The flesh-and-blood rockers depicted in the Rock-It line couldn't be happier 
about being rendered two-dimensional -- they helped to create their books. 
</P>
<P>
 Ex-Runaway Ford even helped write her own story, in which she, her band and 
her faithful dachshund Chili Dog do battle with the oppressive forces of Libby 
Snore (almost rhymes with Tipper Gore) -- leader of the PMRC and commander of 
some zombie-like Young Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford also oversaw the artwork for her book, which was done by respected comic 
illustrator Jim Balent. She's thrilled with the results. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like having an album out. There's the same level of excitement. 
Fans are coming up and saying, 'We love your comic,' and asking me to sign it, 
just like they'd do with a record." 
</P>
<P>
 Ford is not only proud of her comic book, she's actually a bit envious of her 
penciled and inked self. "It's fabulous and wild-looking," she says. "I'm 
putting some of the artwork on one of the guitars I'll use in concert, and I 
also hope to wear on stage the costume that the artist created for my 
character. But I keep looking at the breasts he drew for me, and I wish the 
real ones looked as good!" 
</P>

 Comics have been good to Scott Rosenberg, the founder and president of Malibu 
Comics. He became an entrepreneur at 13 when, having exhausted his meager 
savings buying up comics, he promptly began selling off his more valuable 
titles. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the only way I could make enough money to keep buying more comics," 
says the 31-year-old self-described comic fanatic. "I started renting tables at 
conventions and began my own mail-order business. In 1986, having graduated 
college, I decided it was time to become a legitimate publisher. The way I 
funded the company's start-up over the first few years was again by selling off 
half of my comic collection." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg is extremely happy to be producing a rock 'n' roll comic book that 
the rockers themselves can enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We only wanted to work with bands that really wanted to bring their creative 
vision to an illustrated form," he says. "A lot of what goes on in music 
merchandising is distanced. Somebody buys a license to use a band's name or 
image and then goes off and makes widgets using that name and image. The bands 
aren't involved. But we want the bands to take pride in their comic book." 
</P>
<P>
 The story lines in the Rock-It series will range from straight bio to 
phantasmagoria, and the artwork may be presented as traditional comic panels, 
stylized paintings, or something in between. But Rosenberg explains that the 
process of putting a Rock-It title together is always the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our creative people begin by brainstorming about the bands they want to 
cover," he says. "It doesn't have to be an act from the pop charts, but it does 
have to be somebody who will be exciting on the page -- somebody could sell a 
million records and still not be a good choice for a comic book story." 
</P>
<P>
 Through a partnership with the Gold Mountain Entertainment management firm, 
Rosenberg has access to a wide range of musicians, whom he hooks up with 
appropriate writers and illustrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we've decided on the acts we want to work with, we approach them through 
Gold Mountain and let them know that they can do anything with our resources," 
Rosenberg says. "Anything they ever wanted to do in a video or a movie, they 
can now do in a comic book without ever worrying about the budget. The 
musicians approve the artwork and contribute to the writing of their story. 
Panel by panel, they tell us what to do, and we love it." 
</P>
<P>
 John C. Anderson of the marketing and promotion company International 
Strategic Marketing liked the Rock-It concept enough to sign on as a third 
partner. His company will have the finished books selling alongside the X-Men 
in comic book shops, and alongside Rolling Stone in music outlets and at 
newsstands. Future plans may have the $3.95 comics sold at concerts as 
inexpensive alternatives to tour programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great cross-pollination," says Ron Stone, president of Gold Mountain, 
whose acts include Nirvana, the Lemonheads and Bonnie Raitt. "Comic book 
culture and rock 'n' roll culture head toward each other anyway, and both are 
taken very seriously by some people. Comic books are no longer the domain of 
pimply-faced 12-year-olds. A lot of people read them, and a lot of those people 
listen to rock 'n' roll." 
</P>
<P>
 Stone and Jack Jacobs, Gold Mountain's director of acquisitions, began 
discussing a blending of rock 'n' roll and comic books two years ago when they 
were looking for a novel way to publicize World Domination, Stone's newly 
formed alternative record label. 
</P>
<P>
 They did some research into the comic book world and found that publishing 
giants Marvel and DC were more interested in owning characters outright than 
working directly with musicians to create new books. 
</P>
<P>
 But with Rosenberg, they found a kindred spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been a fan of music -- everything from the Carpenters to Poison," 
he says. "And I'm a madman about comics, so the idea of Rock-It was something I 
jumped at right away." 
</P>
<P>
 While typical comic books can go from conception to publication in a few 
months, the inclusion of the musicians in the approval process means that it 
can take a year for a Rock-It title to go from drawing board to comic racks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poor Scott," says Gold Mountain's Stone, chuckling. "None of the characters 
he's created have ever talked back to him before." 
</P>
<P>
 Rock-It Comix are not the first books to plunk down rock 'n' rollers in a 
format normally suited to super-heroes and dastardly villains. Batman and 
Superman were joined for a short time in 1992 on the DC Comics roster by Prince 
& the New Power Generation (another installment is due soon). 
</P>
<P>
 Marvel, home of the Fantastic Four, once put out an Alice Cooper comic, and a 
pair of KISS titles it released in the late '70s have become collectors' items 
now selling for $50. Marvel has also just released the first edition of, 
huh-huh, a Beavis and Butt-head comic (it is "recommended for immature readers 
only"). 
</P>
<P>
 From less-well-known comics publishers there have been lines of unauthorized 
band histories and one-shot rock 'n' roll parodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the unauthorized books have had unimpressive black-and-white art and 
have been kind of shoddy," Rosenberg explains. "They were unauthorized not in 
the cool sense of that word. They were just slapped together. We're doing 
authorized versions, but these aren't all publicist-polished biographies. 
They're not sanitized. Sometimes the bands want to go in directions that 
surprise us." 
</P>
<P>
 Ford didn't shy away from allowing herself to appear as the sexy protagonist 
of a violent story. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like sex and violence," she says, laughing. "They make my day. I've always 
been a fan of tough women in films -- Sandahl Bergman wielding an ax and that 
sort of thing. Now, in my comic book, it's like I'm getting to be an actress in 
that kind of movie." 
</P>
<P>
 Illustrator Balent, a hot name among comic fans due to his powerful drawings 
of such sexy super-vixens as Vampirella and Catwoman, says he enjoyed turning 
Lita into a heavy metal Amazon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a big fan of strong women, fangs, claws, and rock 'n' roll," he says. 
"Working with Lita was a dream come true." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some books, like Ford's, will take advantage of the form and stretch into the 
fantastic. The Ozzy tale sends the singer into an ominous nether world to pit 
his wits against hellish monsters. Ozzy's late guitarist Randy Rhoads appears 
as a force of light to steer him back to the world of the living. 
</P>
<P>
 Other rockers will use the comic book as an opportunity to tell their band's 
history in their own words. 
</P>
<P>
 Geezer Butler of Black Sabbath is a comic collector himself and is the proud 
owner of first issues of Spider Man, X-Men and, most appropriately, Iron Man. 
He co-wrote the story line for the Black Sabbath comic, and says there was 
satisfaction as well as challenge in putting together the authorized history of 
the band. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to be able to get the facts straight about Black Sabbath for a 
change, but I found out it's possible to get too factual for the comic book 
form," he says. "A good comic has to have the right kind of drama, and most of 
all it has to be a good read, so our history had to fit the form we were 
using." 
</P>
<P>
 He and longtime bandmate Tony Iommi opted for a fairly straight historical 
approach in the Sabbath comic, rather than use elements of fantasy, horror or 
science fiction. They also felt the band would be miscast as supermen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe if Ozzy was still in the band we could all be super-heroes, but I can't 
really imagine me and Tony flying around and doing good deeds," Butler says.  
</P>
<P>
 Illustrator Balent believes that Rock-It has finally solved the difficult task 
of giving a comic book some rock 'n' roll spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always been a real problem mixing music and comics, because you're 
just never going to capture a truly electrifying performance in a comic book," 
he says. "You're not going to get killer guitar licks off of an inked page. My 
first concern with Rock-It was that they might just want flat representations 
of concert scenes, and frankly I couldn't imagine anyone wanting to read metal 
lyrics for 22 pages. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when I found out that the artistic approaches and story lines were wide 
open, and that the wishes of the musicians involved would be treated as gospel, 
I knew this was the way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rock-It line is currently being featured prominently at the three Golden 
Apple comic book shops in the Los Angeles area, and owner Bill Liebowitz says 
they are making an impression. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Ozzy book is selling well because he's so well known, and the Lita book 
is selling well because Jim Balent's art is so well-liked," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Liebowitz is giving the Ozzy book a special push on Feb. 22, when Osbourne 
will make an in-store appearance to sign 1,000 special editions of his books, 
which will be sold on Feb. 20 and 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg is past validation these days, and is well into uncontrolled glee. 
The expectant father says that he sometimes finds it hard to believe that his 
adult day job consists of running a comic book company and fielding calls from 
his favorite rockers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the kid in the candy store. When I wake up Monday morning, I'm bummed 
because it's been a day or two since I was at the office. I may be a grown-up, 
but I'm still kind of nuts about comics and rock 'n' roll."

MAGIC; IT'S JUST MAGIC. REALLY.; RICKY JAY -- CONJURER, HISTORIAN, COLLECTOR OF 
EXOTICA AND DAVID MAMET'S PERSONAL MERLIN -- IS RIDING HIGH WITH A SOLD-OUT OFF 
BROADWAY SHOW AND NEW STATURE IN THE WORLD OF ENTERTAINMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When you meet Ricky Jay, it's impossible not to look first at his hands. As an 
artist of sleight-of-hand illusions, one of the greatest performing today, he 
should have special hands, perhaps extra large, extra long, with an extra 
finger. Something. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he has hands that are surprisingly small for his bearlike size. They 
are also remarkably soft. Better, perhaps, to caress the cards, to make them do 
what he wants them to do. 
</P>
<P>
 In his one-man show, "Ricky Jay & His 52 Assistants," directed by David Mamet 
and opening tonight at Off Broadway's Second Stage Theatre, Jay recites 
esoteric verse and tells stories about esteemed past personalities in magic 
while performing illusions with a simple deck of cards, tricks that leave even 
the most jaded audiences gasping. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting at a table in a stage-set living room crammed with curiosities and 
wood shelves -- a combination of his real Los Angeles living room and Mamet's 
-- he plays blackjack with two volunteers from the audience, dealing himself a 
perfect 21 every time, and poker, dealing himself four aces again and again. An 
audience member picks a card; after some supposed misfires, Jay pulls the 
correct card from a new deck that's sealed in plastic. Another audience member 
selects a card; Jay throws the cards in the air and the one he catches in 
flight is the one. 
</P>
<P>
 To really capture the essence of Jay's magic, though, you have to listen as 
well as watch. In a baroque illusion in which he moves the four queens from 
four separate groups of cards into a group together, the visual illusion itself 
is enough. But what really keeps the audience involved is his rich description 
of each of the queens -- it's not as if they're cards; you feel as if they are 
real women too delicate to actually consort with regular cards. He delivers 
their stories in a courtly, almost hypnotic manner. 
</P>
<P>
 After each trick, you can hear members of the audience asking each other, "How 
did he do that?" Obviously a moot question since Jay will never tell. He's even 
amazed that observers would look at his hands while he's performing and try to 
figure out how the illusions are achieved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why would they think they should be able to figure something out that the 
performer has done for years and years?" he asks evenly, sitting in one of the 
chairs in the theater the day after a preview performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what makes magic different from other art forms -- the concept of 
fooling someone, what that does to the psyche. For some people, it's a really 
wonderful experience. It is for me. Sometimes, though, people get angry. They 
think you're trying to make them feel stupid. I've had people throw punches at 
me or glasses of liquor, grab rosary beads and run screaming out of theaters 
because they thought I had read their minds. The range of emotions is just 
remarkable. You never know what to expect." 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, the audience for a Ricky Jay performance has been devoted and 
cultlike, catching him on the "Tonight Show," reading his books ("Many 
Mysteries Unraveled," "Cards as Weapons" and "Learned Pigs & Fireproof Women," 
a history of eccentric behavior and magicians) and watching for him in Mamet's 
films, notably "House of Games." 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, though, through the formation of his Los Angeles-based consulting 
company, Deceptive Practices, Jay's hand seems to be everywhere in Hollywood -- 
designing sleights and effects for a range of films from "Leap of Faith" to the 
upcoming "Wolf" and "I Love Trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 And since the publication of a profile of him in the New Yorker last spring, 
he finds the focus on him intensifying. His stage show had been in the talking 
stage for several years, but suddenly it got a production go-ahead after the 
piece appeared. The eight-week run then sold out so quickly that there's a line 
nightly waiting for ticket returns. 
</P>
<P>
 The audiences who do get in are, Jay observes, pretty raucous, especially when 
he indulges in his more physical card tricks, hurling them for distance and 
aiming them with laser precision to knock the heads off plastic chickens and 
pierce the tough hide of a watermelon, an out-of-season fruit so pricey, as he 
tells the audience, that it warrants its own credit in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching Jay hurl cards at a melon, it seems so spontaneous that it's easy to 
forget he spends years perfecting each of his tricks -- the gambling moves, for 
instance, are particularly difficult -- and that there are tricks he's spent 
years on that he hasn't mastered yet. His practice doesn't just take the form 
of going over it again and again either. To perform his pure form of magic, Jay 
is also a passionate student of the field, amassing a library of thousands of 
rare volumes pertaining to magic, including the earliest known book about 
conjuring, "La Premiere Partie des Subtiles et Plaisantes Inventions," printed 
in Lyons, France, in 1584. 
</P>
<P>
 "So much of sleight of hand is cumulative, it's taking what's happened before 
and then taking it in a new direction," he explains. "That's the way I got 
interested in the art; I was initially looking for material that people had 
forgotten about." 
</P>
<P>
 From his years on the road opening for such pop acts as the Nitty Gritty Dirt 
Band (a job he inherited from friend and sometime collaborator Steve Martin), 
Jay has canvassed antique and curio shops around the world for rare books and 
vintage toys. They line the walls of his Spanish-style Hollywood apartment, so 
he had a few moments of panic after the recent quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first thoughts were about my friends," he says. "But the books were a 
quick second. Fortunately, they're all right. I just lost a few shelves." 
</P>
<P>
 Mixed in with his books on magic are other, more curious books. He's a 
passionate devotee of "unusual entertainments," collecting anything having to 
do with, among many other subjects, equestrian beekeepers, Swiss bell ringers 
and armless calligraphers, a subject he discussed as part of a chapter on 
accomplished men and women who lacked various limbs in "Learned Pigs & 
Fireproof Women." 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably have the largest collection of artifacts by armless 
calligraphers," he says, his dark eyes twinkling as he grins, enjoying the fact 
that it's just so much more esoteric to collect that than, say, vases or 
stamps. "At least, I know how strange that is. Some collectors are just so 
serious." 
</P>
<P>
 One collection Jay briefly had under his supervision was the Mulholland 
Library of Conjuring and the Allied Arts in Los Angeles, a collection of magic 
journals and artifacts amassed by John Mulholland, a magician, editor and 
friend of Harry Houdini. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, however, magician David Copperfield bought the collection for more 
than $2 million and tried to bring Jay in as an adviser. His first visit to 
Copperfield's display area in Las Vegas was so jarring, however -- to get to 
the collection, he had to go through an antique lingerie display and push a 
mannequin's breast for entry -- that Jay doesn't want to discuss it. He says 
simply "no" when asked if he's ever been back to visit it. And when asked to 
describe the technique of flashy Vegas performers like Copperfield, he answers 
plainly: "I don't describe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the lights-and-costumes approach of Copperfield and Doug Henning before 
him, Jay's style is more closely akin to the great sleight-of-hand artists of 
decades ago, men like Nate Leipzig and Max Malini, who could work wonders 
vanishing objects. 
</P>
<P>
 As a young boy in Brooklyn, he was told about these masters by his 
grandfather, Max Katz, an accountant and all-around curious person. Katz was a 
good-enough amateur to hang around with the best magicians, such as Slydini, 
Francis Carlyle and Dai Vernon, described by Jay as the "greatest 
sleight-of-hand artist of the century." 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded and influenced by these venerable men, Jay performed his first 
trick at the age of 4 at a Society of American Magicians outing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I'm sure I was dreadful," he recalls. (His trick was multiplying coffee 
creamers.) "I was some goofy little kid doing magic. At some point young boys 
growing up all have some experience with magic, and most stick with it for a 
month or two. The only difference was that I stayed with it." 
</P>
<P>
 He studied with these "transcendent" magicians and performed on a few 
children's TV shows. Then, at 13 while performing an act producing doves and 
dressed in a toreador costume made for him by Slydini, he had a meeting with a 
booker for the "Ed Sullivan Show." 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to pretend that I was from South America," he says, "which I knew 
gave me a better chance to go on the Sullivan show than being a kid in high 
school from New Jersey (where the family had moved). I was going to mumble and 
speak through a translator." His family, however, refused to go along and he 
didn't get to go on the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, though, he now shares an office with the producer who bought the 
"Ed Sullivan Show" library and, ever the student, he takes advantage. "It's 
great to go through the office and say I'd like to see Channing Pollack's 
sensational dove act or Rene Levon, the one-armed magician. It's wonderful that 
I have access to all the footage that used to excite me as a kid." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time he was 18, he had moved away from home and was performing in 
Upstate New York, in Lake George and, later, Ithaca, putting in some time as 
well at Cornell's School of Hotel Management. He tended bar in clubs, 
performed, started his own clubs in Ithaca and, when the comedy club boom 
started, talked his way in there. 
</P>
<P>
 At 20, he made his national TV debut on the then-New York-based "Tonight Show 
With Johnny Carson." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very exciting, we were at a rehearsal and I heard the voice over the 
loudspeaker say, 'Johnny's coming,' and he came down and talked to me about 
what I was doing," Jay says. "One piece was Charlie Miller's, a great 
sleight-of-hand artist. Carson knew it. And that to me was just so wonderful." 
(Carson was, as his viewers know, an amateur magician himself.) 
</P>
<P>
 Jay appeared several more times with Carson, eventually in Los Angeles, where 
Jay had moved to follow his mentor, Dai Vernon. 
</P>
<P>
 It was almost inevitable that as a master of deceptions, Jay would become 
involved with Hollywood, a tie initiated with the 1982 film "The Escape Artist" 
from co-executive producer Francis Coppola and starring Raul Julia and Teri 
Garr. In it, Jay advised Griffin O'Neal, who played a young magician. 
</P>
<P>
 "We taught him how to pick locks," Jay says. "And later we found out that 
Griffin was running through the Holiday Inn in Cleveland opening everyone's 
doors." 
</P>
<P>
 Jay met David Mamet when the writer attended one of the magician's shows and 
the two quickly became friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our interest in cons was an immediate thing that we shared," Jay explains. 
"So he asked if I would do various things. He was teaching a course and I did a 
guest lecture. A few projects after that, he cast me in 'House of Games.' " 
(Jay played a con man.) 
</P>
<P>
 He and Steve Martin (with whom he created Martin's magician character Flydini, 
in which the actor unzips his pants and removes an egg, a ringing telephone, a 
glass of wine, etc.) teamed on 1992's "Leap of Faith." Jay designed the con 
games that Martin's faith healer character would use as well as some of the 
visual effects, such as the stigmata appearing on a woman's forehead. 
</P>
<P>
 Other film work came in as well, persuading Jay to formalize his consulting 
work by forming Deceptive Practices (whose slogan is "Arcane Knowledge on a 
Need-to-Know Basis") just over a year ago with friend and fellow magician 
Michael Weber. Their recent efforts include teaching Julia Roberts how to pick 
pockets, perform sleight-of-hand tricks with a coin and cause some research 
papers to vanish for "I Love Trouble," now in production. Roberts has shown 
"quite an ability; she's actually very good with her hands," Jay says. 
</P>
<P>
 For the upcoming film "Forrest Gump," starring Tom Hanks as a Vietnam veteran 
who appears ubiquitously in comic situations, Jay and Weber devised an illusion 
to show a Vietnam vet amputee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since Gary (Sinise, who plays the vet) was unwilling to actually have his 
legs amputated for the film, they had to call us in," Jay explains dryly. 
</P>
<P>
 They also devised the moment onstage in Tony Kushner's play "Angels in 
America, Part 2: Perestroika" in which a man climbs to the top of a ladder of 
light and vanishes in midair. 
</P>
<P>
 The film work pays well, something Jay says that at his undisclosed 
fortysomething age he should be considering. For the immediate future, though, 
his life is occupied with the run of the Off Broadway show, a run that might be 
extended if he can find the time. 
</P>
<P>
 He still has commitments to write a book, "The Magic Magic Book," for the 
Whitney Museum of American Art in New York, a history of early trick-magic 
books for a series produced in tandem by artists and writers, and another book 
on the history of eccentric wagers. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he has to put out his quarterly Jay's Journal of Anomalies, a compendium 
of the oddities he has unearthed, in which he details the lives of conjurers, 
cheats, hustlers, pranksters -- his usual favorite suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the first issue," he says, showing a several-page publication that looks 
as if, in type and yellowish heavy paper, it was printed in the mid-1800s, "I 
do a story on dogs who stole the acts of other dogs." 
</P>
<P>
 The absurdity of it is so wonderful he can't help but smile.

SHE MADE FRIENDS WITH DEATH; CATHERINE BUTTERFIELD WROTE 'JOINED AT THE HEAD,' 
A PLAY ABOUT A BRAVE FRIEND DYING OF CANCER. BUT THAT WASN'T ENOUGH. SHE THEN 
DECIDED SHE HAD TO PLAY THE FRIEND. IT TURNED OUT TO BE GOOD THERAPY AND, 
INCIDENTALLY, A HIT

<P>
 Actress Catherine Butterfield was on tour with a play in Boston and decided to 
give an old boyfriend a call. They chatted for a while, and he invited her over 
to meet his wife, then seriously ill with breast cancer.  
</P>
<P>
 The two women, both in their late 30s, bonded fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was one of those women you meet and like instantly," Butterfield 
explains. "I had just met her, but something about her made me feel I knew her 
for a long time. And the stakes were dramatically heightened by the fact she 
was dying." 
</P>
<P>
 Butterfield, who is also a playwright, couldn't start writing about the 
evening fast enough. At first it was cathartic, helping her sort through a very 
emotional encounter. But soon she was transforming that experience into 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
 She turned out a first draft in three weeks, and several months and rewrites 
later, her play, "Joined at the Head," premiered at New York's Manhattan 
Theatre Club, in October, 1992. The award-winning drama, which is onstage at 
the Pasadena Playhouse through Feb. 20, depicts how a new friend's illness 
affects the life and times of an emotionally guarded, wisecracking novelist. 
</P>
<P>
 Butterfield's tale chronicles the unusual and intense friendship that develops 
between single novelist Maggie Mulroney, and Maggy Burroughs, the dying wife of 
Mulroney's former boyfriend Jim Burroughs. As much about life and vitality as 
about sickness and death, "Joined at the Head" follows the three friends from 
the two women's initial meeting through and beyond Maggy Burroughs' death. 
</P>
<P>
 But Silver Lake-based Butterfield wasn't content to write her story and leave 
it there. She also chose to play one of "Joined at the Head's" three principal 
characters. And her choice was not the role of novelist Mulroney (played in 
Pasadena by Robin Pearson Rose) that is so much modeled on her own experience. 
Rather, it is the role she created in New York -- Maggy, the dying wife of Jim 
(played here by Jeff Allin). 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to play the muse," Butterfield says matter-of-factly. "No one else 
who could play the part knew her. I wanted to communicate her essence and felt 
it would be very difficult to explain her. Maggie Mulroney was more open to 
interpretation because she was an amalgam of people." 
</P>
<P>
 But there was more to it. "The traps are lying all over the place with the 
Maggy Burroughs role. The temptation to go for pathos or pity or try to make 
her some kind of angelic, long-suffering martyr figure is very strong." 
</P>
<P>
 The dying wife was also the smaller of the two roles, and Butterfield was, 
after all, the author of a new, untested play that might need rewrites. 
</P>
<P>
 "The amount of work you potentially do the first time a play is produced could 
be enormous," says Pamela Berlin, who directed the play in both New York and 
Pasadena. "If either the writing or the acting had to suffer, I was much more 
concerned she (first) get the play up to where it had to be." 
</P>
<P>
 The play is complicated structurally, full of flashbacks, asides to the 
audience and even replays of scenes from different characters' points of view. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were many nights she was up for hours working on rewrites," Berlin 
says, "but she was really able to separate herself. When she was onstage, I 
know her writer's mind was going, but she could allow herself to become the 
character." 
</P>
<P>
 Butterfield, a professional actress for 20 years, has been trained to do that. 
When the play was first read at Manhattan Theatre Club, in fact, Artistic 
Director Lynne Meadow recalls, "I thought the woman reading the part of Maggy 
was wonderful. I asked who it was, and they said, 'That's the playwright.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Butterfield was back on a New York stage last fall for the WPA Theatre 
production of her play "Snowing at Delphi," and she is the first to admit she's 
usually writing parts she would enjoy playing. Like everyone from Harold Pinter 
to "A Bronx Tale's" Chazz Palminteri, Butterfield knows the value of writing 
herself a good part. 
</P>
<P>
 As a 40-year-old woman, Butterfield also knows that good parts for women over 
30 are rare: "I know so many talented women who are out of work and I know so 
many not-very-talented men who are working a lot, and I find that really 
appalling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I write to purge myself. But I also write to create good roles, honest roles 
for women instead of the usual panoply of bimbos and mothers. I know women who 
consider themselves lucky to be playing somebody's basically characterless 
mother on TV when they are worthy of so much more." 
</P>
<P>
 It no doubt helps to be as attractive, self-assured and outgoing as 
Butterfield. It probably also helps to be raised in a media-aware family; her 
father managed different CBS affiliate stations around the country, and her 
mother is a former playwright, radio writer and TV talk-show host currently 
affiliated with San Diego Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Butterfield, the oldest of five children, started writing plays in second 
grade and would enlist family members for performances in the garage or 
basement. New York-born, she lived long periods in Massachusetts and Minnesota, 
has a degree in theater from Southern Methodist University in Dallas and did 
stints with California Actors Theatre and the Oregon Shakespeare Festival 
before winding up back in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 She was doing well with her acting career in New York when, in 1983, she came 
down with hepatitis. During her six-month recuperation, she picked up a pen and 
yellow pad and started to write. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't act and had all these juices that needed to flow," she explains. 
</P>
<P>
 She sent that first play off to the Eugene O'Neill Theater Center's 
prestigious National Playwright's Conference. It wasn't selected for a reading, 
but it did make the finals. "I took it as an encouraging sign," Butterfield 
says, "and thought I should keep going." 
</P>
<P>
 If she had any doubts left, reception to "Joined at the Head" should erase 
them. New York Magazine's John Simon called it "an incontestable achievement," 
and other critics generally predicted good times ahead for Butterfield. Last 
fall she received Newsday's George Oppenheimer Award, given annually to a 
writer making an initial New York bow and awarded in prior years to such 
writers as George C. Wolfe and Beth Henley. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Butterfield was also ready for this breakthrough play when she ran into Kathy 
and Peter, the Boston couple she identifies only by their first names. She had 
joined the touring production of Wendy Wasserstein's "The Heidi Chronicles" in 
1990, understudying the lead character at Hollywood's Doolittle Theatre and 
elsewhere, to stock up both money and free time to write plays. She brought 
along her portable computer. 
</P>
<P>
 It is clear talking with Butterfield that Kathy and Peter were far more than 
muses. Asking if the interviewer would like to see what they looked like, for 
instance, she immediately produces a photograph, and the photograph remains 
close at hand, propped up against a vase throughout the entire visit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joined at the Head" closely parallels her own relationship to the couple 
during the last few months of Kathy's life. Portions have been imagined or 
altered for dramatic tension, she says, but the basic main structure is true. 
</P>
<P>
 She tried to be particularly faithful to the character modeled on Kathy. Aside 
from dropping Kathy's Boston accent, Butterfield says, she wrote her character 
much as she perceived her, from her bright, colorful wardrobe to her bravery 
and humor in such an unfunny situation.  
</P>
<P>
 Her novelist-narrator Maggie Mulroney, she says, is "partly me, partly my 
speculations about successful women like Wendy Wasserstein and partly all my 
girlfriends who don't have men in their lives but have careers. That's where I 
came up with the idea of her being kind of a lonely outsider who meets these 
people and is affected by them deeply." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Much of "Joined at the Head" is drawn from Butterfield's experience, of 
course, including a riotous depiction of a pompous TV talk-show host. She was 
writing away in her Boston hotel room when a cable interview with Wasserstein 
came on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been sort of fascinated with her, this successful writer who seemed 
kind of lonely in some ways," Butterfield says. "I think some of her bled into 
the play." 
</P>
<P>
 (Wasserstein, who was also a judge on the Oppenheimer Award, says she enjoyed 
that scene in Butterfield's play and considers her "a playwright with a great 
deal of promise because she is both witty and humane. Also, she's able to treat 
a tragic subject with humor, which is very difficult to do.") 
</P>
<P>
 "Joined at the Head" evolved through several readings, including one in a 
Washington, D.C., hotel room during the "Heidi" tour, another at the New Voices 
playwriting program at Los Angeles' Matrix Theatre and, eventually, at 
Manhattan Theatre Club. Hearing in Butterfield "an interesting new voice," 
MTC's Meadow booked the play for a full production. 
</P>
<P>
 Commitment from a major New York theater put Butterfield in a quandary: how to 
tell her friends she had turned their lives into theater and was already 
speculating on Kathy's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kathy was a nurse and knew her prognosis; the cancer had reached her vital 
organs," she says. "But it felt kind of presumptuous, which is why when they 
said they were going to do the play, I was thrilled and terrified at the same 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 She also wondered when to tell her friends. So when Peter was dancing with her 
at her October, 1991, wedding to agent Larry Corsa in New York, "I thought, 
'This is the moment,' and I told him." Both members of the couple read the play 
and, she says, "Kathy called to say, 'You got everything right. You told the 
truth.' After we hung up, I burst into tears." 
</P>
<P>
 The play was postponed once, which worried Butterfield. Kathy was "failing 
fast" and had a goal of getting to New York to see the play. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy, who made it to previews, died eight weeks later on the show's closing 
day. "It sounds like hubris," Butterfield says today, "but I really felt our 
play was keeping her alive." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, she says, it was difficult for her to play in the show again in Los 
Angeles, particularly repeating her role as the dying wife. She says she had 
hoped to play the larger role of the novelist this time out but was convinced 
by Pasadena Playhouse producers to reprise her New York performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so meaningful the last time, so supercharged," says Butterfield, her 
eyes filling with tears. "Now that she's gone, it's more difficult to play her 
with the same hopefulness, and I sometimes go home very depressed." 
</P>
<P>
 It probably helps that she's written a sequel of sorts. The Manhattan Theatre 
Club commissioned "The A.V. Man," a drama that follows Jim's life after his 
wife dies. The play, which MTC is considering for next season, opens with a 
grief-therapy group session but is less tied to real events than is "Joined at 
the Head." 
</P>
<P>
 Not one to waste an experience, Butterfield has also started work on a new 
play that came indirectly from her publicity efforts on "Joined at the Head." 
After her mother started questioning remarks Butterfield made in the Village 
Voice about growing up with Hedda Gabbler, the playwright thought it might be 
interesting "to rework 'Hedda Gabbler' as a woman trapped in suburbia in the 
'50s." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, she's not about to give up acting: "I know there's much more demand 
for good writers than for good actresses, but I don't want to give acting up, 
because it's so satisfying. So if I can do both, I'd consider myself the 
luckiest of women."

COVER STORY; INSIDE THE ROSENTHAL ZONE; AS SHE WATCHES THE WORLD FALLING DOWN,

NOT ABANDONING HER GLOBAL THINKING, IT'S JUST THAT THE NEW CHAOS CAN GET TO BE

 It's Super Bowl Sunday and UCLA's Royce Hall is quiet. A maze of freshly 
installed whitewall corridors blocks the entrances to the landmark building's 
theater, which is closed until the damage from the recent temblor can be fixed. 
The few usable classrooms and offices are temporarily empty. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the back of the otherwise dormant building, however, an after-lunch 
crowd of people in sweats and kneepads gathers near a loading dock, while six 
large mutts loll contentedly in the afternoon sun. 
</P>
<P>
 The dogs are the tip-off. 
</P>
<P>
 When on the trail of Rachel Rosenthal, all you have to do is look for the 
omnipresent canines. And sure enough, the artist's famous shaved head is soon 
visible, bending over to smooch a pooch, as a bevy of performers hovers nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet no sooner does Rosenthal turn to a discussion of the scenes to be covered 
in this afternoon's rehearsal than an assistant breaks in to tell her that Dojo 
has arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "I rescued a dog," Rosenthal explains, as she excuses herself to attend to the 
more pressing affairs of a black-and-tan shepherd mix. "Mehmet Sander is 
thinking about adopting him and they're going to be meeting each other, so I 
have to go," she says, referring to the choreographer and Rosenthal 
collaborator. 
</P>
<P>
 A company member standing just out of earshot says what many think. "She's 
more interested in animals than people," he quips affectionately. And Rosenthal 
might not dispute the charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately though, she's changing. "My usual work is centered on a very 
anti-anthropocentric view of things," says Rosenthal, 67, who's at Royce to 
rehearse "Zone," an interdisciplinary performance with a 50-member cast. 
</P>
<P>
 "And in this piece, because of what's happening in Los Angeles and the world 
-- and maybe also because of my age and mellowing a bit -- I've become very 
interested in people, much more than ever before." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal is concerned not just with Los Angeles' riots and natural disasters, 
but also the ways in which L.A.'s evolution into a Third World city is part of 
a global sea change. She is out to show society the errors of its destructive 
and divisive ways, and her medium is a grand multimedia theater that 
incorporates text, dance, music and large-scale visual set pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheer force of her on- and offstage personality, though, also helps get 
the message across. And while she has been criticized for failing to tread 
carefully on such volatile topics as race, she's also been hailed for the 
passion of her beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the elements of her work are held together by the strength of her 
human spirit, a sense of humanity," says producer Jedediah Wheeler, who 
presented Rosenthal in New York in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Her topics are as personal as autobiography and as grandiose as the annals of 
planet Earth. In fact, a characteristic Rosenthal work would overlap two such 
disparate histories in order to show connections between the two. Nearly 
always, though, Rosenthal's essential subject is man's inhumanity to man and 
the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm saying in different ways is that unless we can learn to see 
ourselves cosmically as a species, and not reduce ourselves to groups racially, 
nationally or however, we are probably going to become extinct. We can't go on 
destroying ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 With "Zone," her message seems even more urgent, and this time the scale and 
ambition of the work far outstrip the artist's many previous efforts, 
threatening to make this one of the most important works of her 40-year career. 
Co-commissioned by the UCLA Center for the Performing Arts and the Rachel 
Rosenthal Company, "Zone" plays the Wadsworth Theater in West L.A. on Friday 
and Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal's topic is the approaching millennium, as seen through a dramatic 
and choreographic collage of text, movement and music in which the artist and 
an ensemble of five play the family of Nicholas II, Russia's last czar, pitted 
against more than 40 other performers, labeled collectively "the throngs." 
</P>
<P>
 Brewing since 1992, "Zone" is Rosenthal's first full work to appear on an L.A. 
stage since she premiered "Pangaean Dreams" at the 1990 Los Angeles Festival. 
And the new work is generating a national buzz, thanks to Rosenthal's singular 
stature in the experimental performing arts world. 
</P>
<P>
 As an artist who helped create and define not only the feminist art movement, 
but also that ever-expanding open-ended genre known as performance art, she has 
been influential through her art, her teaching and her outspokenness in the 
media. Rosenthal is, after all, one of the enduring larger-than-life figures of 
the American avant-garde. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Inside Royce's basement rehearsal room, the pooch-cuddler has been replaced by 
the commandant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have two weeks, that's it," Rosenthal reminds the polymorphous crowd 
spread throughout the room, chastising latecomers with a glance. "So, come ." 
They all line up and listen. Pronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing about 5-foot-6 without the black platforms she sometimes wears, 
Rosenthal still seems a giant. She's dressed simply today, in a baggy green 
cotton outfit and black tennies. The only vestiges of hipness are the exotic 
dangling earrings that hang from the multiple-piercings in her ears, her chic 
eyeglasses . . . and of course the trademark bald pate. 
</P>
<P>
 First shorn onstage in a 1981 performance called "Leave Her in Naxos," 
Rosenthal has kept the Kojak look ever since. "It felt comfortable and it 
throws people," she says with her usual blend of didacticism and 
down-to-earthness. "It goes against gender roles. And it's easy to take care 
of." 
</P>
<P>
 It's the same mix of wit, confession and globally conscious commentary that 
has marks Rosenthal's performance pieces. In "L.O.W. in Gaia" (1986), for 
instance, she posed as a city-dweller out on a trek in the desert, where she 
met the dying goddess Gaia. By the boil of a Sterno campfire and to the music 
of Erik Satie, Rosenthal offered a jocular litany of her daily ablutions on the 
trek. And she displayed the endless caravan of tissue-stuffed plastic bags 
she's got in tow to prove it. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Pangaean Dreams," Rosenthal entered in a wheelchair, railing at the 
destruction of the environment, then went on to juxtapose the image of the 
breakup of the mythical supercontinent Pangaea with tales of the disintegration 
of her own body. When the piece played New York in 1991, the New York Times' 
Stephen Holden wrote: "Rosenthal can be growlingly ominous. . . . She can also 
be very funny." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal's performances, combining text and movement with a multimedia 
collage of sights and sounds, have included solos and larger-cast spectacles. 
"Zone," however, will be not only the largest work she's ever made, but also 
the first to integrate her character into an ensemble instead of singling 
herself out as a featured performer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a style which involves incredible verve, polish and range, like a 
singer who can sing from a high soprano to a bass," says Moira Roth, Trefethen 
Chair of Art History at Mills College in Oakland. "Her self-mockery allows her 
to get away with (things). I think of her as a wonderful intellect in 
ecological and cultural history." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially in larger works such as "Zone," the theatrical montage evokes 
traditions ranging from Antonin Artaud's theater of cruelty to the political 
theater of Erwin Piscator, with its combination of visceral emotion and 
panoramic drama. It also shares qualities with the contemporary spectacle 
theater of Robert Longo, Robert Wilson, Richard Foreman and others that first 
flourished during the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Rosenthal also belongs in the company of her fellow diva- auteurs -- women 
who create swirling, high-voltage spectacles around their own central roles. 
She's broken ground with a performing persona in much the same way as the late 
choreographer Martha Graham or the younger vocalist-composers Diamanda Galas 
and Laurie Anderson. But then, the world sorely needs its arts Amazons. 
</P>
<P>
 In Greek mythology, the goddess Gaea (or Gaia) is the Earth. Born out of 
chaos, she goes on to become the mother of all things. 
</P>
<P>
 Rachel Rosenthal can relate. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just that she's invoked Gaea in works, from "L.O.W. in Gaia" to 
"Pangaean Dreams." Nor only that she's also an imposing figure that The Times' 
Martin Bernheimer has called "a monument, and a marvel . . . a force of nature 
. . . (who) defies the observer not to be magnetized." 
</P>
<P>
 It's that Rosenthal knows what it means to come up out of chaos and go on to 
create. 
</P>
<P>
 The daughter of well-off Russian parents, she was born in Paris in 1926. Her 
family fled the Nazis when she was 13 years old, leaving their wealth behind in 
a series of close-call escapes. After stays in Spain, Portugal and Brazil, in 
1941 they landed in New York, where she attended the High School of Music and 
Art. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, she continued her studies in New York and Europe with some of 
the most famous names of modern art, dance and theater, including Piscator, 
Hans Hofmann, Merce Cunningham and Jean-Louis Barrault. 
</P>
<P>
 She moved to Los Angeles in 1955 and shortly thereafter launched the Instant 
Theatre, an experimental theater group that she directed for a decade. As she 
remembers the late '50s and early '60s, her group stood out in a very 
conventional L.A. art scene: 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing. It was a cultural desert. The only thing besides me was 
the Ferus Gallery, the home of California art, and all these people who were 
there -- the men with their girlfriends, because, of course, there were no 
women artists -- were my first audience. They came every weekend to see my 
Instant Theatre." 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1970s, Rosenthal was one of the key figures, along with Judy 
Chicago, Sheila deBretteville and Arlene Raven, associated with the feminist 
art movement centered in Los Angeles, which emphasized the previously hidden 
lives of women. It was during this period that Rosenthal and performance art 
found each other. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, experimental performance was largely conceptual rather than 
theatrical -- the Happenings of Allan Kaprow as an example -- based on an 
art-school/anti-art aesthetic that often focused on the human body as canvas. 
Feminist artists, however, saw the chance to have a genre of their own. And 
their typically autobiographical solos gave shape to the feminist slogan "the 
personal is political." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal saw an affinity with her own work -- "I realized I had been doing 
things like (performance art), just calling it something else" -- and she 
brought her extensive background in theater and dance to bear on the form, 
pushing it in a new, more theatrical direction. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s, Rosenthal made a number of works about her childhood, her 
family, her body and her love-hate relationship with food -- archetypal 
feminist topics. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has always had a wonderfully grand sense of autobiography, with a mythic 
undercurrent to it," says Mills College's Roth. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, around 1981, the year L.A.'s Feminist Studio Workshop shut down and 
feminism in general began to suffer body blows, Rosenthal began to de-emphasize 
autobiography and gravitate toward global concerns. That was the "symbolic 
moment," as Roth puts it, and the beginning of the Rosenthal most people know 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Even people who know nothing, or maybe only one thing, about the avant-garde 
often know of Rosenthal. So when NBC needed someone to play a performance 
artist on the series "Frasier," for example, Rosenthal was the natural choice. 
</P>
<P>
 And Rosenthal has dabbled elsewhere in the popular media too, including a part 
in the upcoming Michael Tolkin film "The New Age" and one appearance as a 
panelist on PBS' "MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour." 
</P>
<P>
 She has also been known to speak out on issues of the day. In 1990, for 
instance, Rosenthal rejected her badly needed $11,250 National Endowment for 
the Arts grant in a gesture of solidarity with the artists known as the NEA 4 
and to protest the endowment's enforcement of a so-called obscenity clause. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she's best known for her stage work. Rosenthal has performed at 
prestigious festivals around the world, including the 1987 and 1990 Los Angeles 
Festivals, Documenta 8 in Kassel, West Germany, in 1987, and Festival 
Internacional de Teatro in Granada, Spain, in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Jed Wheeler brought Rosenthal's "Pangaean Dreams" to Lincoln Center's 
Serious Fun! Festival. (The annual festival, produced from its inception by 
Wheeler's International Production Associates, was widely considered a premier 
showcase for progressive and avant-garde work. Wheeler's ties with the series 
ended last summer after Jane Moss, Lincoln Center's new director of 
programming, took over the festival.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Zone" was first conceived in July, 1992, when Wheeler invited Rosenthal to 
create a new work for 1993's Serious Fun! Four months later, however, Moss 
vetoed the Rosenthal project without public comment. Meanwhile, Rosenthal had 
already arranged to present the work in Los Angeles through UCLA's Center for 
the Performing Arts. UCLA picked up the ball and co-commissioned the project 
with Rosenthal's own company. The work includes choreography by Mehmet Sander 
and an original score written and performed by Amy Knowles. 
</P>
<P>
 On a broad level, the piece reflects Rosenthal's interest in chaos theory, a 
field that has blossomed with computer technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chaos dynamics show that every system and every aspect of our world contain 
the seeds of chaos within order and the seeds of order within chaotic systems," 
she says. "The 'zone' is that fine line, the bifurcation (where) you can go 
either way; the point at which free will comes into consciousness in human 
beings. All of Western science until this century, because we didn't have the 
capacity to accurately measure turbulent systems, simply ignored them. And of 
course most of nature is made up of turbulence." 
</P>
<P>
 That's one whopping metaphor for human wrongheadedness, from Rosenthal's point 
of view. But it's not the only image of biped folly that appears in "Zone." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal and an ensemble of five white performers in whiteface (Angie Bray, 
Harvey Perr, Carol Katz, Joan Spitler, Kirk Wilson) portray the family of 
Nicholas II. They share the stage with 40 or so mostly nonwhite women and men, 
"the throngs," who move about the stage in Sander's electrically athletic 
choreography. 
</P>
<P>
 "I use the metaphor of the family of the last czar of Russia because they 
really (expletive) up at the beginning of the century and we're (expletive) up 
at the end of the century," Rosenthal says. "I wanted to use them as the 
epitome of a certain class of privileged people who go on with certain totally 
erroneous assumptions about the world. And of course they get murdered." 
</P>
<P>
 "The throngs" are the contrast. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have these people onstage who are multiethnic and whose presence, pressure 
and activities are continually felt by this small island of white Western 
patriarchal civilization," Rosenthal says. 
</P>
<P>
 Her methods of assembling "the throngs," however, have already ruffled 
feathers. To find the unpaid volunteers who appear onstage, Rosenthal sent out 
faxes and letters to artists of color and others, looking for people who might 
want to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of people who received these inquiries were insulted by the 
suggestion that they should work for free, and by what they saw as the racial 
specificity of her request. But then, Rosenthal has taken heat for alleged 
insensitivity before. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, she was awarded a $20,000 grant from the Los Angeles Department of 
Cultural Affairs to support her work with a group of young artists of various 
ethnic backgrounds. In August of that year, an interview about the grant 
appeared in The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one artist, performer-writer Keith Antar Mason of the Hittite Empire, 
was angered by Rosenthal's comments that she expected African American artists 
from the inner city to have an "interesting approach to language," Latinos to 
have "flashiness," Asian Americans to have "brashness" as well as "tremendous 
subtlety." 
</P>
<P>
 "This sounds like stereotypes," Rosenthal was quoted as saying, "but . . . 
these are the flavors I've experienced in my previous classes." 
</P>
<P>
 Later that year, Mason wrote and performed two works locally taking Rosenthal 
to task: "Rachel Ain't Got No Brain," Parts I and II (a play on the title of 
Rosenthal's 1987 work "Rachel's Brain"). 
</P>
<P>
 The issue, Mason says, was that what Rosenthal said in The Times "reeks of 
superiority, like she could come in and understand every nuance of someone 
else's culture. That's what 19th-Century anthropologists were saying." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenthal, of course, knows that her subjects of race and oppression touch on 
deep sensitivities: "Absolutely I'm pushing people's buttons. I'm sure that a 
lot of people will misunderstand." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not her way to mince words, though, especially given what she sees as an 
urgent planetary state of affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people come (to Los Angeles) and they are totally different from the 
dominant culture and their numbers grow, which is what's happening, then things 
are going to be turned around, whether there's bloodshed or not," she says. 
"It's going to be as big a historical event as some of the great migrations and 
invasions of Europe, simply from the bulk of the population involved." 
</P>
<P>
 And Rosenthal, for one, is not about to let the changing world go by without 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm eager to create pieces that both expose what's happening and are 
healing," she says. "My only problem is that I'm at the age where you can sort 
of expect to die in a limited amount of time. It's a pain, frankly, because I 
am so curious to see what happens next."

MOVIES; PREVIEWS -- HOW EARLY IS TOO EARLY?; SOME FILMMAKERS REALLY HATE IT 
WHEN THE MEDIA REPORT ON TEST SCREENINGS OF WORKS THAT ARE FAR FROM FINISHED. 
BUT FOR MEMBERS OF THE PRESS, THESE REAL SNEAK PREVIEWS ARE AN INCREASINGLY 
IMPORTANT PART OF THE MOVIE BEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Director Barry Sonnenfeld was in the midst of screening "Addams Family Values" 
last fall when he decided to show research audiences a more daring rough cut of 
the film. 
</P>
<P>
 After mulling it over, he changed his mind. The Paramount film had played well 
in past screenings. Why add something that might prompt a negative reaction? A 
nightmarish fantasy began swirling in Sonnenfeld's head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought to myself, 'What if the film didn't play well and the Los Angeles 
Times finds out about it? Then suddenly I'm going to pick up the paper and read 
that I'm the director of a movie that's in trouble.' " 
</P>
<P>
 From the point of view of Hollywood filmmakers, Sonnenfeld isn't being 
paranoid. Over the past year or so, The Times, Entertainment Weekly, the New 
York Times and other publications and entertainment TV shows have been 
aggressively increasing their coverage of what were once closed-door show-biz 
events: test screenings, movie re-shoots and multimillion-dollar budget 
overruns. Just a few examples of the controversial practice that industry 
powers call "let's get 'em" journalism: 
</P>
<P>
 * In December, 1992, the "Today" show interviewed Jim Meigs, then 
Entertainment Weekly's film editor, who predicted that "Toys" would be the bomb 
of the season -- even though he hadn't even seen it. 
</P>
<P>
 * Early last May, two weeks before "Sliver" was due out, the Los Angeles Times 
wrote about rumors that the Paramount film was "in serious trouble" and had 
undergone re-shoots of scenes that amounted to as much as 40 pages of dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 * In September, Entertainment Weekly pounced on James L. Brooks' $40-million 
musical, "I'll Do Anything," offering details from a "disastrous" test 
screening that one anonymous attendee described as "the worst torture 
possible." 
</P>
<P>
 * In what proved to be the most controversial story of all, the Los Angeles 
Times ran a news item last June 6, citing anonymous sources talking about a 
poorly received test screening of Columbia Pictures' "Last Action Hero." The 
news item, written by free-lance writer Jeffrey Wells, was hotly contested by 
Columbia, which briefly threatened to pull the studio's advertising and deny 
the paper's reporters access to future Columbia film releases. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight months later, Columbia marketing chief Sid Ganis is still seething about 
negative pre-release reporting on "Hero."  
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost yellow journalism," he says. "The press is in an 'Oh my God, is 
this film in trouble' mode. How can a film be in trouble if it isn't finished 
yet?" 
</P>
<P>
 The practice has also extended to coverage of TV and pop music. Before Conan 
O'Brien's NBC show "Late Night" hit the air, for example, Entertainment Weekly 
reviewed a dress-rehearsal show, panning the fledgling host's "painful" banter 
with his sidekick, Andy Richter, noting how frequently his jokes bombed 
("often") and deriding what it called his lackluster interviewing style. 
</P>
<P>
 And five months before Nirvana released "In Utero," its much- anticipated 
follow-up album to 1991's "Nevermind," the Chicago Tribune and Newsweek ran 
stories saying that Geffen Records, the band's label, had been unhappy with the 
album's abrasive sound -- and had persuaded the band to hire a hit-making 
engineer who would give the songs a more polished sheen. 
</P>
<P>
 But the really big battles have erupted over coverage of Hollywood 
work-in-progress decisions. Filmmakers see such stories as a sign of the 
media's growing obsession with easily digestible info-bites and gotcha-style 
reportage. Action-movie impresario Joel Silver, angry after being stalked by 
the press while making "Hudson Hawk" and "Die Hard 2," says the intrusive media 
scrutiny has made him wary of producing risky, high-profile movies. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I made 'Die Hard 2' for 20th Century Fox, it was followed by clouds of 
bad press -- every publication said I was a crook and that everything was out 
of control. That's why I didn't make 'Beverly Hills Cop 3,' " contends Silver, 
who was asked by Paramount to produce the sequel after its original producers, 
Don Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer, left the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, entertainment reporters say poorly received test screenings or a 
sudden flurry of re-shoots are newsworthy events, since they often serve as 
early indicators of the success or failure of high-profile film projects. And 
in many cases, it is a coterie of top Hollywood producers, agents and studio 
executives who are the first to whisper in reporters' ears about problems 
plaguing a rival's film. 
</P>
<P>
 The increased scrutiny has prompted a series of ferocious spin battles for 
control of a film's image, a battle that can sometimes signal the difference 
between box-office triumph or disaster. Since a movie's success is often 
determined by its opening-weekend grosses, Hollywood marketers are under 
increased pressure to build a fever pitch of awareness for a film with a 
barrage of celebrity interviews, TV trailers and ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Any negative buzz about an upcoming film can break this marketing spell. 
Entertainment Weekly recently reported that Kurt Russell, star of Disney's 
"Tombstone," hated a rough cut of the "troubled" film so much that he called it 
the "worst (expletive) he's ever acted in." Russell later disputed the quote, 
saying he was talking about the movie's music, not the film itself. Meanwhile, 
"Tombstone" has gone on to perform well at the box office, despite that bad 
buzz and mixed reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 The heightened tensions between movie studios and the media focus on a simple 
truth -- this is a media age in which perception is reality. If a film studio 
has a stinker on its hands, its top marketing priority is keeping the press off 
the scent for as long as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter if the movie doesn't deliver," Columbia Pictures publicity 
chief Mark Gill said in Harper's magazine last year. "If you can create the 
impression that the movie delivers, you're fine." 
</P>
<P>
 But if the movie makes a bad impression, watch out. One well- placed news item 
about a supposedly troubled film can prompt a wave of skeptical press coverage. 
The bigger the wave, the more likely the impact on the film's box-office 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a monumental task for filmmakers to overcome," says PMK's Pat Kingsley, 
the powerful and combative Hollywood publicist who has loudly complained about 
media coverage of her celebrity clients, most notably Tom Cruise. "One little 
item can do a lot of damage. Once it gets picked up by every other newspaper, 
it sets the agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 To no one's surprise, filmmakers never question press accounts of a successful 
test screening. Francis Ford Coppola blasted The Times for printing "innuendo" 
about an early "Bram Stoker's Dracula" test screening. But there were no 
complaints when gossip columnist Liz Smith hyped a pre-release screening of the 
same film, saying it "played through the roof" with an audience that "screamed, 
gasped and laughed in all the right moments." 
</P>
<P>
 Believing they had a potential hit on their hands, the producers of last 
summer's "Sleepless in Seattle" didn't hide their film from the press, either. 
Though the film wasn't due in the theaters until June, the producers held two 
advance screenings in late January, only weeks after the studio first saw the 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
 They invited a handpicked audience of key newspaper, magazine and TV media 
representatives, who were shown what producer Gary Foster describes as a rough 
cut of the film. 
</P>
<P>
 "By giving the press an early peek, before the film was finished, we felt it 
put them on our team," Foster explains. "It was a conscious decision to let the 
journalists decide for themselves. That way, when they became our mouthpiece, 
the word of mouth had a lot more credibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Credibility cuts both ways. In Hollywood, bad buzz regularly originates from 
studio insiders eager to gain an edge over their competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not fair to call the media negative," says Times movie editor Claudia 
Eller. "People in this town are so competitive that they're always putting a 
negative spin on their rivals' films. As reporters, we try to figure out what's 
really news -- and what's just someone with an ax to grind." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem is that test screenings serve two purposes. Filmmakers see 
them as an artistic tool, using audience reaction to help them make hundreds of 
subtle alterations in narrative, theme and character development. 
</P>
<P>
 But film studios frequently use screenings in other ways -- either as a way of 
determining whether audiences will embrace a particular ending, or as a 
marketing weapon, using positive audience reactions as a means of building good 
word of mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, filmmakers say, stories about poorly received test screenings are, in 
effect, judging a movie before it is finished. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're really reviewing a rough draft of a film," says Polly Platt, producer 
of "I'll Do Anything," which opened on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is some little old lady in Indiana going to think when she logs onto 
Prodigy and reads our clips? 'Oh, it's that musical film that had terrible 
screenings and now they've delayed the release date and taken out all the 
music.' She's going to say to herself, 'Wow, that must be a bad picture.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Many moviegoers may have been thinking the same thing about last summer's "So 
I Married an Axe Murderer." As early as last January, in the midst of a story 
about a battle over the film's script credit, The Times reported that the Mike 
Myers vehicle was in trouble. Re-shoots were in the works after several 
mediocre test screenings. The film's release was being bumped back from March 
to August. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though executives at TriStar, the film's distributor, said the film had 
tested well and Myers' agent insisted that re-shoots "are more the rule than 
the exception" these days, the bad buzz spread quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Axe Murderer" producer Rob Fried compared the process to a wildfire. The 
Times piece was followed by an Entertainment Weekly piece about bickering 
between Myers and "Wayne's World" co-star Dana Carvey, which also mentioned 
"mixed reactions" to "Axe Murderer." People magazine ran a gossip item saying 
the film was getting bad word of mouth after poor test screenings. 
</P>
<P>
 These were followed by more negative press in Us, Premiere and the New York 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got to the point where everybody in Hollywood thought our movie was in 
trouble," Fried says. "My mother in Boca Raton was talking about it at the 
mah-jongg table." 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the "Murderer" production team did a junket to promote the movie, 
the film's perceived problems -- and accounts of Myers' difficult personality 
-- became a major part of nearly every feature piece on the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 "It affects you everywhere," Fried says. "Theater owners hear the bad buzz and 
they get reluctant to book the film. The studio marketing executives hear about 
it and they get nervous about supporting the film. When the movie came out, 
even the critics -- who should be judging the film on its merits -- were 
writing about problems on the set." 
</P>
<P>
 "Toys" producer Mark Johnson says he and director Barry Levinson were on the 
dubbing stage in late 1992, working on the film's score, when they turned on 
the "Today" show and heard Entertainment Weekly's Meigs tell host Bryant Gumbel 
that "Toys" was going to be the Christmas season's big bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very unfair and demoralizing," Johnson says. "The film wasn't even 
finished. No one had seen it yet. Yet everyone who watched 'Today' already 
thought we were a flop." 
</P>
<P>
 Meigs' prediction was accurate: "Toys" grossed only $23 million. But Johnson 
believes it was a self-fulfilling prophecy: "It just created a terrible 
climate. It really branded us." 
</P>
<P>
 But not every film is harmed by negative advance press. Also in late '92, the 
press was full of bad buzz about "Bram Stoker's Dracula," including a Los 
Angeles Times piece by contributor Jane Galbraith that reported on re-shoots 
and negative comments from anonymous test-screening audience members, who said 
they found the film "hard to follow." 
</P>
<P>
 "Dracula" director Francis Ford Coppola was so incensed by the story that he 
wrote a letter to The Times, disputing the piece. He concluded by saying: "What 
does an incomplete, early preview . . . have to do with a finished movie? How 
can a movie be anything but formula if you can't even preview it as part of the 
creative process without printed gossip?" 
</P>
<P>
 The movie went on to become a major box-office hit, prompting some filmmakers 
to argue that test screenings aren't especially reliable indicators of 
box-office performance -- and hence aren't especially newsworthy, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of all the films I've made, 'For Love or Money' had the best test-screening 
scores," says director Sonnenfeld. "Yet 'The Addams Family' made 10 times what 
'Love or Money' did. 
</P>
<P>
 "To say a movie is in trouble because of a bad screening is like looking at a 
building when it's still all raw steel girders and scaffolding and saying it's 
going to be ugly. You really can't tell until it's finished." 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for all this jousting between filmmakers and journalists has been 
the explosion of media interest in Hollywood. Visit any newsstand and you'll 
see a tidal wave of movie industry coverage, from magazines with puffy 
celebrity profiles to newspapers with savvy business reporting to tabloids with 
sharp-tongued gossip items. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have become an entertainment junkie culture," says Entertainment Weekly's 
Maggie Murphy, the senior editor who oversees the magazine's News & Notes 
section. "Now there's a generation of entertainment consumers who are curious 
about the decisions that come into play before the films reach the theaters." 
</P>
<P>
 With the arrival of chart-oriented publications like USA Today and info-hungry 
shows like "Entertainment Tonight," movie studios shrewdly began using a new 
film's opening-weekend business as a sign of box-office success. Early each 
week, movie fans can find weekend box-office results in hundreds of newspapers 
around the country, not to mention on CNN, E! Entertainment cable and 
innumerable local TV news shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "By Monday night, everyone knows that some movie didn't open as big as it was 
supposed to," says People magazine senior editor Leah Rozen. "That's part of 
moviegoing in the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrities have always sold newspapers. But now newspaper readers are more 
sophisticated -- they want to read spicy coverage about conflicts over 
financing, budget overruns, on-location snafus and other behind-the-camera 
Hollywood action too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the print media started competing with tabloid-TV news shows like 
'Inside Edition' and 'A Current Affair,' you had everyone searching for 
brand-name material, names that people know," Joel Silver contends. "Nobody 
cares if they put out a candy bar in Hershey, Pennsylvania, that doesn't sell. 
But if Barry Levinson, the director of 'Rain Man,' makes a movie and it doesn't 
work, that's news." 
</P>
<P>
 The question for Hollywood journalists: What part of the filmmaking process is 
fair game for news coverage? 
</P>
<P>
 "If a finished film is being test-screened, I think it's appropriate to report 
on the results," says Anne Thompson, a senior writer at Entertainment Weekly. 
"But I don't think it's fair to report on an unfinished film that's being 
tested simply to help the filmmaker decide what works." 
</P>
<P>
 Weekly Variety "Buzz" columnist Michael Fleming says he largely avoids writing 
about test screenings, pointing to directors like Robert Zemeckis and James L. 
Brooks, who view the screening process as a crucial editing tool. 
</P>
<P>
 Some reporters believe otherwise. Pat H. Broeske wrote an Entertainment Weekly 
piece that detailed the fallout from a "disastrous" early screening of "I'll Do 
Anything." 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a highly touted $40-million musical by a major director which wasn't 
going to make its Christmas release," Broeske says. "When a monster gamble like 
that is having problems, it's news. Reporters in Detroit write about problems 
cars have in their design and manufacture. They don't always wait till they've 
come off the assembly line." 
</P>
<P>
 Times Executive Calendar Editor John P. Lindsay says newspaper readers have 
every right to read about the process of movie-making, especially since they're 
eventually going to pay money to see those same movies in the theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of our job, especially for a paper based here in Hollywood, is to cover 
the process," he says. "If a movie's out there and the filmmaker is showing it 
to people, then it becomes our responsibility to write about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Responsible reporting may be one thing, but gossip and innuendo are something 
else again. Pat Kingsley contends that the print media have taken a "let's get 
'em" attitude toward the industry. She has repeatedly scolded the press, in 
particular Entertainment Weekly, for "hostile" coverage of her client Tom 
Cruise's casting in "Interview With the Vampire," citing reports that the actor 
was wearing shoe lifts and jealous of co-star Brad Pitt. 
</P>
<P>
 Kingsley also has been unhappy with The Times' coverage of "I'll Do Anything." 
She contends that The Times "forced" Brooks into letting staff writer Terry 
Pristin attend test screenings and question him about the film's problems for a 
story that ran in September. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times had originally planned to report on an earlier, poorly received test 
screening, based on eyewitness accounts from several unnamed audience members. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we hadn't agreed to invite the reporter, the paper would have printed an 
item saying Jim had a negative test screening," Kingsley says. "I think 
covering a film before it's finished is below-the-belt. Jim resented doing the 
interview. He felt it was a violation." 
</P>
<P>
 Calendar's Lindsay says The Times never forced Brooks to agree to anything: 
"It was a negotiation, not extortion," he says. "It was our way of getting more 
access and information. I think the story we ran presented a balanced account 
of the test-screening process." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the filmmakers who have felt the glare of bad press are pulling their 
wagons in a circle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't imagine that we'd ever preview a movie in town again," says producer 
Platt. "We had bad screenings on 'Broadcast News,' but we were allowed to 
experiment without every reporter in town calling. Now the climate has changed. 
What was once a private process has gone public." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Columbia's Ganis: "Movie-making is both a business and an art form. And 
you can't write about something that's essentially artistic, like screening an 
unfinished movie, as if it's just business." 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone defines the debate as art versus commerce. From the media 
perspective, the issue is viewed as a time-honored struggle for access to 
information, a tug of war reporters engage in while covering every beat, 
whether it's Hollywood or the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until recently, most entertainment coverage was very controlled," says 
Entertainment Weekly's Maggie Murphy. "But that's all changing. And I think the 
studios get uncomfortable when they realize we're no longer part of their 
marketing plan."

A CLASSIC CASE OF CROSSOVER ARTISTRY; JAZZ PIANIST ELIANE ELIAS MAY BE FROM 
BRAZIL, BUT HER REPERTOIRE IS NOT JUST FROM IPANEMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN, Don Heckman is a frequent contributor to Calendar. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eliane Elias hasn't needed the force of an earthquake to break down the glass 
ceilings and stylistic barriers of the music business. In the last decade, the 
Brazilian pianist/composer has convincingly demonstrated her skills in the 
still sometimes macho world of jazz improvisation. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't always easy. 
</P>
<P>
 When she first came to New York in 1981, "I had to work very hard," she said 
recently in a phone conversation from her New York City home. "Harder than a 
man with my skills might have had to work to become established. And, being 
attractive, being Brazilian, people had preset ideas. When I moved to New York, 
I got nice smiles and, 'Oh, what's your phone number?' and I really wasn't used 
to that. At first I thought, 'Well, what's all this about?' But whenever I got 
a chance to sit down and play, oh boy, it changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "And, in a way, maybe it worked out for the best. If you go to a club and like 
the way a guy plays, you might remember him. But if you go and see a girl, and 
you like her playing, you're going to definitely remember her." 
</P>
<P>
 Last winter, Elias knocked aside yet another wall when she released a 
recording of exquisite performances of classical works by Bach, Chopin, Ravel 
and Villa-Lobos. The reception in the classical community has been, in Elias' 
description, "very positive -- much better than I ever expected." 
</P>
<P>
 Elias, who performs Thursday at the Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena with 
drummer Peter Erskine, bassist John Patitucci and her 9-year-old daughter, 
Amanda, had no plans for a classical music career when she came to this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never really thought of becoming a performing artist with classical music," 
she said. "I had studied a lot of classical music as a child, of course, but 
jazz was always my first love. After I came to America I started studying at 
Juilliard mainly for the purpose of improving my technique to play jazz -- 
exploring how the piano is a stringed, as well as a percussion instrument. And 
that kind of study had a real effect on the way I was writing, as well as the 
way I was approaching the instrument. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I didn't expect was that I began getting these wonderful reactions from 
people I respected in the classical world. Then, when I made a tape of the 
Gershwin 'Rhapsody in Blue,' some of the people who heard it began to rave 
about it. So when EMI approached me to do an album of solo classical pieces, I 
felt ready to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps appropriately, the ambitious, eclectically gifted Elias was born in 
Sao Paulo, southwest of the more laid-back and better known Rio de Janeiro. It 
is South America's largest city and the energy center of Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first came to America from Sao Paulo, I thought Manhattan looked like 
a little suburb," Elias said with a laugh. "Sao Paulo is so big, and so crazy, 
even though it's filled with very hard-working business and career people. But 
it's somewhat neurotic, and very energetic -- very different from the vibes 
from Rio." 
</P>
<P>
 Which may be one of the reasons why Elias has seemed, at times, so elusive to 
the American jazz audience. From the moment the slender, attractive pianist 
became a visible performer, she has been the most unusual of Latin American 
imports -- a jazz musician who happens to be Brazilian, rather than a Brazilian 
jazz musician. 
</P>
<P>
 Elias' prodigal talents were recognized and respected at an early age, 
especially by her mother, Lucy, a classical pianist with a strong affection for 
jazz. But Elias' vigorous appetite for all kinds of music also included a 
healthy sampling of Brazilian street rhythms -- samba, choro -- as well as 
American pop tunes. By the age of 15, she was already teaching master classes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her jazz skills had surfaced even earlier. At 11, she could play most of the 
repertoire of American classic pop songs. Her record collection included a wide 
array of American jazz pianists: Bud Powell ("He gave me goose bumps"); Red 
Garland ("When I heard him play 'This Can't Be Love' it made me cry"); Nat Cole 
("He made me crazy"); Art Tatum ("I couldn't even believe what he was doing"). 
</P>
<P>
 "It was always very easy for me to write things down," she recalled, "so I 
would spend hours with my little phonograph, putting the needle down here, 
putting it down there, and transcribing the solos." 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, she resisted Brazilian musical associations when she came to the 
United States, eager to prove herself as a jazz musician. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, she has begun to examine the Brazilian repertoire familiar to 
American audiences -- the music of composers such as Antonio Carlos Jobim, Joao 
Gilberto, Ivan Lins, etc. Even with Brazilian music, however, she has insisted 
upon framing her readings in a dynamic jazz context. 
</P>
<P>
 Her Ambassador program will be a mixture of "everything I do -- all my musical 
sides." The performance of one of the Villa-Lobos pieces from her EMI classical 
album is a strong possibility. Among the certainties are some straight-ahead 
jazz, a few Brazilian numbers and at least one extended solo rendering of a 
ballad standard. Her daughter Amanda will also make her public debut, singing a 
Milton Nascimento song. 
</P>
<P>
 Balancing single parenthood (Elias, now 33, is currently separated from her 
husband, jazz trumpeter Randy Brecker) with a busy music career has not been 
easy for Elias. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been very difficult," she said. "And it's even more difficult now that 
she's not so little anymore. When she was small, I worried about when she cried 
and got a fever. But now she's a little person with feelings and emotional 
needs, which makes it very hard to leave her when I have to go on the road. 
Fortunately, she loves to go to Brazil in the summer to be with her 
grandparents, and that's the time I try to schedule my touring. But it's hard. 
I love music so much, and I could never get away from it, but I also want to 
center my life around my daughter, as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Personal challenges aside, Elias has done a remarkable job of maintaining her 
creative integrity while establishing a successful entertainment business 
career in a new country. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe in walls between people, no matter where they come from, or 
between creative kinds of expression," she said. "And I enjoy being an 
attractive woman. Why shouldn't I? But my looks have nothing to do with my 
music. When you hear me play, judge me by my creativity, not my appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the same thing, in a slightly different way, is true about playing 
different styles -- Brazilian, classical music, jazz, whatever," Elias 
continued. "If I can bring some of the free spirit of jazz to my classical 
playing, some of the discipline of classical music to my jazz improvising, and 
some of the spirit of Brazil to everything, then it seems to me that I can't 
help but be a better artist with all kinds of music."

ONE FROM THE HEART; SCOTTISH TRIO ONE DOVE ADDS SINCERE LYRICS, ORGANIC EDGES 
TO ITS HOUSE-BORN DANCE MUSIC. 'THERE'S SO MUCH MUSIC OUT TODAY THAT IS JUST 
ABOUT NOTHING,' SAYS LEAD SINGER DOT ALLISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 "We've taken our hearts and wrung this music out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Dot Allison, the 24-year-old lead singer and co-lyricist of the promising new 
Scottish dance music trio One Dove, chuckles slightly at her melodramatic 
description of the group's music. 
</P>
<P>
 But only slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 She's a woman who believes music should be personal and revealing -- not 
exactly qualities often associated with hit dance music. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our music's sincere in the same way good country & western is sincere . . . 
sincere in the same way good soul music is sincere," says Allison, a 
classically trained pianist. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what separates our music from the typical dance album is that it's 
really heartfelt. There's so much music out today that is just about nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking from her mother's home in Glasgow, the city where the group was 
formed in underground dance clubs in 1991 and continues to live, Allison is an 
articulate woman who shows little of the coyness of so many young British pop 
musicians of recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Outlining the group's artistic goals and ambitions, she displays the candor 
and wit that make One Dove's debut album, "Morning Dove White," such an 
inspired step in the evolution of dance music. (The album, on London Records, 
was named after the tribe of Elvis Presley's Native American 
great-great-grandmother.) 
</P>
<P>
 While One Dove's roots lie in the dance clubs that spawned the group, it also 
embraces influences that range from Brian Wilson, '60s girl groups and Bobbie 
Gentry to Marc Bolan, Iggy Pop and reggae legend King Tubby. 
</P>
<P>
 One Dove -- which also includes guitarist Jim McKinven and 
keyboardist-programmer Ian Carmichael -- effortlessly merges disparate musical 
elements. That has led to the group's initial stateside success coming in 
rather unexpected places. 
</P>
<P>
 "It received a lot of requests when we first put it on," says Darcy Sanders, 
music director at L.A.'s leading alternative rock station, KROQ-FM. "It's 
something that sounded really different. We're all waiting to see what the next 
trend is in the whole ambient-dance genre, what is going to be the dance 
equivalent or counterpart to Nirvana and Pearl Jam, and it seems like they may 
be it." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Neil Harris, director of A&R for London Records in New York: "Reaction to 
this record has been surprisingly positive. We expected the first single, 
'White Love,' to simply be a setup, to just introduce the band on their own 
terms. We wanted to let them establish themselves on their merit as a real 
band. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also wanted to avoid hyping them too much as the next big thing from the 
U.K., which only asks for a backlash, so we were going for a more low-key push. 
We've been a little surprised at how quickly and positively reaction has 
built."  
</P>
<P>
 If others seem surprised at there being an audience for rule-breaking, 
ambitious dance rock, the members of One Dove predict bigger shocks are in 
store. 
</P>
<P>
 "What excites us right now," Allison says, "is that there's a bit of a 
revolution going on. We're at the end of an era. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the charts in U.K. are really congested with bland, formulaic pop 
songs that are only there because radio programmers won't allow anything else 
to filter through. But people are starting to get really bored with it, and the 
record companies are starting to come 'round to the realization that there is a 
market for something different." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One Dove's flight began in the late '80s, when house music -- the bass-heavy, 
groove-driven music epitomized by later mainstream hits such as Madonna's 
"Vogue" -- was the dominant sound in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, the three members were in separate groups, but all identified 
with the underground dance-club scene in Scotland, which embraced the 
do-it-yourself punk ethic. Bands recorded limited-edition pressings of records 
that were mainly passed around to other bands just to see who was currently up 
to what. 
</P>
<P>
 The old "art for art's sake" adage was embraced, and it was just as well. The 
major labels weren't sure of what was happening and showed little interest in 
what was going on within the club scene. 
</P>
<P>
 After all three passed through various bands (McKinven was also a member of 
the early-'80s band Altered Images), they formed One Dove, where they felt a 
chemistry at work. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, they recorded a demo tape that contained a rough version of the lush 
"Fallen," a song that also appears on the debut album. The group managed to get 
it into the hands of acclaimed British producer Andy Weatherall, who signed One 
Dove to his own independent label, Boy's Own. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's tape became one of the hottest on the club circuit, receiving a 
barrage of press coverage before there was even an official record release. 
Working with Weatherall, the trio, which insists that the album is not that far 
removed from the tape it initially presented to the producer, put the finishing 
touches on what would become "Morning Dove White." 
</P>
<P>
 Collectively, the group has stitched together an aural quilt unlike anything 
else that has come out of the dance arena. 
</P>
<P>
 Where dance music since the glory days of disco has had a sense of drama and 
theatricality, One Dove makes music that is cinematic. Its trance-inducing 
atmospherics and literate lyrics blend into a whole that is also very visual -- 
a subtle, skillful play with darkness and light. 
</P>
<P>
 With a base of thick bass lines influenced by the Jamaican dub style and 
occasional blistering guitar, the threesome combines Allison's shimmering, 
clear vocals (often distorted or used to breathy effect), a pop master's sense 
of melody and penetrating lyrics that explore the rockier side of 
relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 One Dove's scope extends from the lilting, echo-driven, Phil 
Spector-goes-reggae groove of "Breakdown," which will be the next single from 
the album, to the spare, beautiful "There Goes the Cure." 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim brings a more somber side to us," Allison says of the guitarist. "He is a 
big Marc Bolan fan and a big fan of Brian Wilson, but he's more interested in 
the darker side of the Beach Boys -- the kind of music where when you scratch 
the surface, you find it's not quite what it seems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't write nice, girly kinds of lyrics or anything, but what I write might 
be more sensual or more feminine sounding, so we set each other off as a 
contrast to begin with. 
</P>
<P>
 "And Ian's sound is quite his own. He's very interested in very ethereal 
sounds. He sometimes writes lyrics that are more feminine than mine are." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Having already toured the United Kingdom to warm reviews, One Dove, which has 
been augmented by a lead guitarist and a drummer from a Glasgow jazz-funk band, 
is preparing to tour the United States. The band will be at the Whisky on Feb. 
23, where it will be joined by deejay Scott Hardkiss, who will try to lift the 
event beyond the typical rock show. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're bringing in the deejay," says London Records' Harris, "because it 
really is all about joining the two cultures, rock and dance. That's one of 
their goals on this tour." 
</P>
<P>
 Allison stresses, though, that although there will be a deejay, there won't be 
any of the glitz normally associated with tours by dance-oriented artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to avoid doing what so many dance acts do, which is to try to use that 
(glittery aspect) to mask a certain hollowness. People try to enhance the 
superficial aspects of their act, and that's why they get so theatrical or what 
have you. There's got to be a bit more work, a bit more sincerity in there. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has to be a more organic feel if you're going to be taken seriously as 
an artist. (Those acts) have to comply with the competition, which will be 
artists who are not trying to sell their fans short. Our show is really quite 
organic. What you see is what you get. There's nothing else, really." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked if she feels any added pressure, being not only a musician and 
singer but the visual and emotional focus of the band, Allison starts off in 
one direction, then swings unexpectedly to deliver a punch -- much like the 
music of One Dove. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mind that there is a huge amount of pressure on me in the live 
situation," she says, "because that's my job. That's what I've undertaken. It's 
up to me to communicate with the audience, and hopefully I can do that. The 
downside, though, is that people think you're just a puppet, and that really 
annoys me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because I'm just as much a songwriter and equal musician as anyone else in 
the band. But because of my position, and because of my blond hair, there are 
so many people, especially here in the U.K., who jump to the conclusion that 
I'm just another Wendy James (the sexpot lead singer of the defunct band 
Transvision Vamp) and there's nothing but hot air underneath the blond hair." 
</P>
<P>
 What type of audiences does Allison think One Dove will attract in the United 
States -- where, unlike England, the dance and rock worlds seem mutually 
exclusive? 
</P>
<P>
 She's hoping the group's cleansing and emotional music brings together fans 
from both areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never want to lose sight of the fact that our audience is not only every 
shade of sexuality or what have you, but every shade of musical taste or 
sensibility," she says. "We want to break through all the barriers."

HOMELESS COUPLE TIE THE KNOT AT SHELTER WEDDING; CEREMONY: THEIR VOWS AT 
NATIONAL GUARD ARMORY ADD NEW MEANING TO THE WORDS 'FOR RICHER, FOR POORER . . 
.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The bride wore a lacy beige dress. The groom was in a freshly pressed red 
shirt. And the guests were sprawled on cots nearby.  
</P>
<P>
 A few people nodded off during the ceremony, but Lorraine Cronjager and Ron 
Barklow didn't seem to notice. They were too busy looking at each other 
Saturday night as they became the first couple to get married at the National 
Guard Armory. 
</P>
<P>
 Cronjager and Barklow, who are both homeless, nervously exchanged wedding 
vows, promising to care for each other "in sickness and in health, for richer 
or for poorer." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the culmination of a whirlwind three-month courtship in the shelters 
and on the streets of Santa Ana, where Cronjager, a former waitress in her 
mid-40s, and Barklow, 40, a former warehouse worker, both searched for 
friendship and respect. They found it in each other.  
</P>
<P>
 "I know it will work," Cronjager said as she twirled her bouquet of pink 
carnations just before embarking on her sojourn up the aisle between the 
gymnasium's cots. "We're a lot alike and we've both been through a lot."  
</P>
<P>
 Cronjager, who is from Newport Beach, has been married twice before, each time 
for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Barklow, whose red shirt and black slacks were donated for the wedding, said 
he doesn't quite know what to expect because he's never been married.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't plan on getting married again. She's the right woman. That's the way 
I feel," Barklow said.  
</P>
<P>
 The wedding brought an evening of excitement to the armory, where the county 
provides food, showers and beds to about 100 homeless people on cold winter 
nights.  
</P>
<P>
 As banda music and the song "Tomorrow" from the musical "Annie" blared from a 
stereo, Orange County Clerk Gary L. Granville officiated -- free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew what the conditions were, and so it would be fiendish for me not to," 
Granville said. He also waived the fee of $62.50 couples normally pay for a 
marriage license. 
</P>
<P>
 Groomsman Valdivio Harvey, who has been homeless about six months, said he 
wished the couple great happiness. "Having someone is important, because if you 
don't have the necessities the other people have -- a companion -- you're very, 
very sad," Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony, replete with two wedding cakes, sparkling cider, and the 
throwing of the garter and bouquet, brought some uncommon joy to the people who 
call the armory home during the winter, said Maria Mendoza, the county director 
of homeless issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are not a lot of things for these people to look forward to. Times are 
pretty tough," Mendoza said. "But the little community around the shelter has 
been cheered up by all this. Someone has found a bit of happiness."

SAN JUAN'S PAST, FUTURE MEET DOWNTOWN; REDEVELOPMENT: THE CITY MUST BALANCE THE 
INTERESTS OF PRESERVATION AND COMMERCE WHILE CONSIDERING HISTORIC TOWN CENTER 
PLANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A wealthy rancher rides in from the dusty hills to rescue a financially 
struggling town. He and a local saloon owner round up more than $1 million in 
cash and promise to buy an entire city block, outmaneuvering a band of 
out-of-town investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Millionaire rancher Richard J. O'Neill's recent bid to buy a major chunk of 
downtown San Juan Capistrano may play like a spaghetti Western, but it's 
actually the latest real-life chapter in the history of this city, one of 
California's oldest communities.  
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill's plans -- although as yet unspecified -- have stirred up new 
questions over an ongoing local dilemma: How does historic San Juan Capistrano 
inject new life into its aged, Spanish-style downtown while still preserving 
its history? 
</P>
<P>
 It is a question that has plagued the city for two decades. But it has new 
life with the arrival of O'Neill and the anticipated unveiling in the coming 
months of the city's plans for a new downtown renovation called the Historic 
Town Center. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are hoping that O'Neill, other prospective downtown investors 
and the town center project will bring economic vitality to the city without 
sparking another battle between two powerful local political factions -- the 
historic preservationists and downtown business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "City leaders since the mid-1970s have given an enormous amount of thought 
about what should occur in the historic downtown," Councilman Gary L. 
Hausdorfer said. "Hopefully, what evolves there will be something that is 
pleasing to all the competing political interests in town." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, keeping peace downtown has not been easy. The city's 
redevelopment agency, which was launched in 1983 to inject new vitality in the 
city and now owns most of the downtown, is the moving force behind new projects 
and owns the land that O'Neill wants to buy. In town, the agency is regarded as 
a villain or a savior, depending on who you ask. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents on the preservationist side, such as Dr. Roy Byrnes, a former mayor 
and city councilman, charge that redevelopment has over-commercialized a 
charming old city, bringing in traffic and tourists at the expense of a bucolic 
way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Redevelopment in San Juan Capistrano has been a severe mistake," Byrnes said. 
"The whole thing was a foolish adventure and the people with their hands on the 
wheel running this city should have known better." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonsense, said Ken Friess, a former 17-year city councilman who helped launch 
the agency and continues to be its outspoken promoter. He is now a downtown 
builder and consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any objective person can go downtown on a Friday night and see 
the life, the vitality there and say it was a mistake," Friess said. "None of 
that could have happened without the redevelopment agency." 
</P>
<P>
 Like it or not, the redevelopment agency will remain a downtown player, 
largely because it owns about 10 acres of city property straddling El Camino 
Real, just south of the 218-year-old Mission San Juan Capistrano. The O'Neill 
parcel along Ortega Highway across the street from the mission is also agency 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 Later this month, the City Council is expected to vote on whether to sell the 
property to the rancher. O'Neill has declined to comment during the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, city planners have labored painstakingly to avoid a replay 
of what occurred in the late 1980s, the last time the redevelopment agency 
planned a town center along El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
 While preparing environmental documents for a proposed hotel and commercial 
project in 1988, city workers discovered a wall of buried 200-year-old adobe 
bricks, determined to be an old portion of the mission's barracks. 
</P>
<P>
 The preservationists erupted and, within months, their outcry halted the 
complex and chased the San Diego-based developer out of town. Downtown 
businessman Paul Farber, whose own Franciscan Plaza project was caught up in 
the protest, still shudders at the thought of that time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city at that time suddenly became very political, very political," Farber 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, however, city officials insist things are different. By summer, six 
new historic town center proposals will be unveiled.  
</P>
<P>
 Meant to embody both the new and old of San Juan Capistrano, the range of 
projects is designed to appeal to diverse interests, including a plaza, a 
museum, and archeological sites interspersed with shops and restaurants, city 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 And this time the planning process has been staffed side-by-side by business 
leaders and preservationists, said City Manager George Scarborough. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are doing is responding to a community process with unprecedented 
community involvement that is underway as we speak," Scarborough said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hausdorfer, who was a backer of the old hotel project and is the only 
remaining council member from those days, now says it may all work out for the 
best. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will never know how that project would have evolved . . . but ironically, 
it has all turned out to be a positive," Hausdorfer said. "It has given the 
residents the opportunity to do some things that otherwise might have been 
impossible. We now have an opportunity to make an intelligent decision, a truly 
rational decision."

DRIVER KILLED, 2 INJURED IN HEAD-ON CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 37-year-old Newbury Park man was killed in a head-on collision on California 
150 near a Lake Casitas campground, the California Highway Patrol reported 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Buc was traveling east on Lake Casitas Road at 4:45 p.m. Friday when he 
swerved into the westbound lane and crashed into a pickup truck driven by Randy 
Crabtree, 36, of Oak View.

 Buc was pronounced dead at the scene, authorities said, and his passenger, 
Robert Dennis of Eagle Rock, was flown to the Ventura County Medical Center and 
treated for head injuries. Dennis, 32, was in fair condition Saturday, a 
nursing supervisor said.

 Crabtree was taken to Ojai Valley Community Hospital, where he was treated for

MAN HELD IN FATAL 1993 SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura police have arrested a suspect in the slaying of a Ventura man who was 
shot and killed last year outside his apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Garabet Majoubian, 45, of Canoga Park on Friday in the Dec. 20 
shooting of Erasmo Moro, 48, an Italian national.Moro's body was found in the 
carport area of the Scandia Apartments in east Ventura after police and 
firefighters answered reports of gunshots. Moro had been working at a pizza 
shop in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on a tip from a woman who knew both men, Ventura detectives focused 
their investigation on Majoubian soon after the shooting, according to a police 
report. It could not be immediately determined where detectives picked up 
Majoubian on Friday, although he was arrested without incident, according to 
the report.

AT I-POLY, THE WORLD IS THEIR CLASSROOM; EDUCATION: INTERNATIONAL THEMES ARE 
WOVEN THROUGH THE CURRICULUM OF SPECIAL HIGH SCHOOL. STUDENTS LEARN VIA E-MAIL 
WITH GLOBAL PEN PALS.

<P>
 Around the globe, high school cyberspace is jamming with talk of Mortal Kombat 
video games, the rock sounds of the Smashing Pumpkins and Doc Martens 
grunge-wear boots. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day, students at a new high school on the Cal Poly Pomona campus can't 
wait to jump into the action and read their computer E-mail from English 
classes in places such as Hong Kong, Japan and Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 The conversation is the fast and furious language of youth, in which debates 
on U.S. troops in Bosnia turn on a dime to, "Hey, did you read the messages 
from those 16-year-old boys in Europe who get to drink beer legally?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like we're all one people," said Sonya Torres, 14, a freshman at the Los 
Angeles County International Polytechnic High School, known as I-Poly. "There's 
one race, the human race. I've lost a lot of my prejudices . . . like the 
Japanese eat rice or whatever, or the Russians are, like, smarter," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Sonya and 11 other freshmen are part of the first class at I-Poly, a public 
high school in which international themes are woven through the curriculum. The 
students, for instance, study English through international E-mail pen pals, 
math through tracking stocks on the global market and foreign languages at Cal 
Poly's language laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 On Fridays, students review what they learned that week through class skits. A 
recent one involved mock interviews with President Clinton and former President 
George Bush, complete with presidential masks. 
</P>
<P>
 I-Poly, which is run by the county Office of Education and Cal Poly Pomona, 
was funded by a $150,000 grant from the state Department of Education's high 
school education office. Teachers and staff are from Cal Poly Pomona and local 
school districts. The county's two other specialty high schools are Cal State 
L.A.'s performing arts high school and Cal State Dominguez Hills' math/science 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Poly's high school is open to students in Los Angeles, San Bernardino, 
Riverside and Orange counties. Selection is based on applications, personal 
interviews and essays. The first class, which started in September, ranges from 
honors students to at-risk teen-agers with potential, said Principal Chris 
Dayian. This month, 60 more students will join the school. The numbers will 
gradually increase until enrollment reaches about 500. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next couple of years, Dayian plans to arrange for the students to spend 
a semester abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Heather Anderson, 15, said I-Poly is more demanding than other high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, other schools teach out of a book," she said. At I-Poly, teachers 
"get right down into the culture."

LONG BEACH GETS NICE CUT FROM HAIR SHOW; COMMERCE: MORE THAN 52,000 STYLISTS, 
SALESPEOPLE AND MODELS DROP $33.8 MILLION INTO THE LOCAL ECONOMY DURING TRADE 
CONVENTION.

<P>
 Sitting on the arm of a raggedy couch backstage at the Terrace Theater, 
Stephen Moody watches four women in light mesh tops and filmy shorts dance to 
synthesized music.  
</P>
<P>
 The choreography is incidental. Moody is concentrating on the models' 
close-cropped hair, glimmering in a rainbow of blond shades. 
</P>
<P>
 "Short, textured hair with quite a lot of height in the center, along the top, 
that's what's new," said Moody, principal of Vidal Sassoon's internationally 
known hair academy in Los Angeles. "And blond is big, very big." 
</P>
<P>
 Moody nodded. The models were ready to hit the theater's stage in the Long 
Beach Convention Center, where hundreds of hairdressers were waiting for just 
such trend-setting pronouncements from Sassoon and other national and 
international stylists who trotted out their designs. 
</P>
<P>
 The models danced. The company's top stylists also demonstrated new cuts on 
other models. Instamatic cameras flashed throughout the audience to record the 
latest trends. And then, armed with The Word (blond is big, short is hot), the 
hairdressers would return home. 
</P>
<P>
 This three-day Long Beach Beauty and Trade Show has an impact on fashion as 
well as the local economy, promoters and city officials say. Yet it came and 
went with hardly a ripple in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 52,000 stylists, salespeople and models arrived from throughout the 
country and abroad, and dropped about $33.8 million into the local economy by 
the time the show ended, according to promoters.  
</P>
<P>
 The show's economic impact is second only to the Grand Prix, according to 
figures offered by the Long Beach Area Convention and Visitors Council. The big 
race brings in more than 200,000 visitors a year and adds $40 million to $60 
million to the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the beauty and trade show gathering, which began in 1939 as a competition 
among local hairdressers in the basement of the Masonic Temple on Locust 
Street, may be harder to ignore in the future. The show will be expanded to 
five days instead of three. Although the show isn't open to the general public, 
the crowd is expected to approach 80,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers also expect to take advantage of an expanded Convention Center, 
nearly quadrupling exhibition space to 320,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 That means space for hundreds more booths selling nail polish, hair 
extensions, acrylic nail extensions, skin care products, capes, T-shirts, wigs 
and coloring products. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors hope to attract stylists and beauty manufacturers from Japan, South 
Korea, Europe and South America, said William Prather, president of Long Beach 
Hairdressers, which organizes the show. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, the Long Beach event is the only hair show of this 
size. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was an L.A. show like this, but it bombed," said Sassoon's Moody. "It 
was downtown and was just not conducive to young girls walking around looking 
like this." 
</P>
<P>
 He gestured at dozens of young women, staring into mirrors or accepting yet 
another coating of hair spray. These models had quarter-inch yellow buzz cuts, 
fountains of red hair springing into space, or mountains of complicated, 
multicolored curls. 
</P>
<P>
 The haircuts shown on stage are usually not everyday styles. This is the 
avant-garde, the idea factory for your local beautician, who might try to sell 
the short and blond idea, but probably not that red fountain of hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the theater, stylists were buying more modest hairpieces, along with 
bagloads of hair spray, coloring agents and combs. They stopped at various 
booths to see the latest permanent wave techniques and test new nail enamels.

WINTER OLYMPIC WONDERLAND; SNOW, READINESS AND PRICES ARE HIGH IN LILLEHAMMER 
LESS THAN A WEEK FROM OPENING CEREMONY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 As members of Lillehammer's bid committee waited in the garden of a Seoul 
hotel in the summer of 1988 for International Olympic Committee President Juan 
Antonio Samaranch to read the name of the city that would organize the 1994 
Winter Games, their leader, Petter Roenningen, was nine time zones away. 
</P>
<P>
 The banker thought little more of Lillehammer's chances than he had when he 
first suggested the idea to other town leaders in 1977. "It was just a joke," 
he said. Even Crown Prince Harald, who is now Norway's king, called it a "wild 
idea." 
</P>
<P>
 Roenningen and his colleagues, however, made enough of an impression during 
their first bid, for the 1992 Winter Olympics that were awarded to Albertville, 
France, that the IOC encouraged them to return. In Korea, they again expected 
to win the prize for congeniality and nothing more. 
</P>
<P>
 On the night before the IOC's vote, in a party for the bid committees from 
Oestersund, Sweden; Sofia, Bulgaria; Anchorage, Alaska, and Lillehammer, the 
Norwegians were easy to pick out of the crowd because they were the most 
carefree, sporting red noses to match their red blazers after numerous toasts 
to their Swedish neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Oestersund was the favorite, so much so that Samaranch was overheard the next 
afternoon, before receiving the sealed envelope with the results of the voting, 
practicing the pronunciation of the name. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, Roenningen was back home. He figured it would be considerably more 
fruitful to be in Lillehammer for the opening of the hunting season than to be 
in Seoul to commiserate with the other losers. 
</P>
<P>
 Other members of the bid committee were no more optimistic, which is why they 
sat for several moments in stunned silence when Samaranch, without practice, 
mispronounced the name of the winner as "Lilly-hammer," instead of the correct 
Lill-uh-hammer.  
</P>
<P>
 Listening on his car radio, Roenningen was so shocked he almost drove off the 
street, which minutes later was filled with virtually all of the 23,000 
citizens of Lillehammer, the smallest city other than Lake Placid, N.Y., to 
become an official Olympic host. 
</P>
<P>
 The national drink, aquavit, flowed for 48 hours before the people sobered up 
to the challenge ahead of them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee (LOOC) sought to inspire 
confidence, adopting the slogan, "They Said It Couldn't Be Done, but We'll Do 
It." When some Norwegians complained that all that did was advertise their 
insecurities to the rest of the world, the slogan was abbreviated, "We'll Do 
It." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, as the digital calendar in LOOC headquarters counting down the days 
until next Saturday's opening ceremony reaches 6, it appears as if they were 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 Storefronts on the picturesque main street, Storgata, are made up like a 
debutante at her coming-out party. State-of-the-art venues have seals of 
approval, not only from athletes but also from architects and 
environmentalists. Sewers have been upgraded, roads widened and trains and 
buses added to accommodate the estimated 100,000 persons who will visit here 
during each of the 16 days of the Olympics. Most of them will stay 110 miles to 
the south, in Oslo, because there are only 3,100 hotel beds in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the weather has gotten into the spirit. For five years, no 
self-respecting snowman would be found in Lillehammer, a condition so worrisome 
to organizers of the ski competitions that they enlisted the aid of snow-making 
cannons. But so much snow has fallen this winter that 7,000 truckloads are 
being carted out each day. Enough is still standing -- more than nine feet in 
places -- that fences built to separate spectators from competitors at some 
outdoor venues have been buried. 
</P>
<P>
 As evidenced by the 3,000 miles of cross-country skiing courses in the region, 
and the fact that Lillehammer is the world's only known city with a skier in 
its coat of arms, those who live here enjoy snow. But this is too much of a 
good thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a scene out of the television show "Northern Exposure," a moose in search 
of food was spotted two weeks ago on Storgata, and elk have abandoned the pine 
forests for more open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 People have had to forage through their basements for standing sleds, called 
spark s, that enable them to travel through the snow quickly and safely. But 
despite the inconvenience, they understand that they are helping to create a 
favorable ambience. The Lillehammer that will be seen on television throughout 
the world is a winter wonderland, and that was the image the town leaders had 
hoped to sell when they bid for the Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 A stopover on the King's Road between Oslo and Trondheim during the Middle 
Ages, Lillehammer was a commercial crossroads for centuries, then a market town 
that attracted the region's farmers, who were immortalized in Henrik Ibsen's 
"Peer Gynt." 
</P>
<P>
 The road to prosperity in the modern ages, however, is lined with tourist 
dollars, and Lillehammer found itself losing to Norway's fiords. 
</P>
<P>
 Located at the north end of Lake Mjosa, Norway's largest body of fresh water, 
Lillehammer became popular among Scandinavians for summer vacations. But the 
city also aspired to be recognized for its winter beauty, which has been 
captured for years by native artists, whose landscapes show off snow-covered 
rolling hillsides and an ethereal, pastel-shaded light. 
</P>
<P>
 To become a winter resort today, though, requires not rolling hillsides but 
mountains, and although there are a couple near here, they were not developed, 
even after Norwegians caught Alpine skiing fever in the 1970s. Before then, 
only cross-country was considered true skiing. 
</P>
<P>
 To catch up, town leaders knew they needed the impetus of the Olympics. But to 
get the Olympics, they needed slopes. To their credit, they were able to 
convince the IOC that they could create mountains out of molehills. 
</P>
<P>
 That, however, was not the decisive factor in Lillehammer's favor. Numerous 
reasons for the IOC's vote have been advanced, including an outrageous one 
involving Eastern Bloc pique over Swedish treatment of Soviet submarines, but 
it was probably tradition that carried the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Although 4,000-year-old rock carvings depicting men on skis have been 
discovered north of here, allowing Norway to proclaim itself "the cradle of 
skiing," and its athletes have dominated competition in Nordic sports for 
decades, the IOC was sensitive to the fact that the only time the country has 
served as host of the Winter Games was in 1952 at Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
 The IOC also was impressed by Lillehammer's plan for an Olympics that would be 
inexpensive and compact, neither of which materialized. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we got the Games, all the cities that hadn't offered a single Norwegian 
kroner for the bid wanted a piece of the cake," Roenningen said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the federal government decreed that Lillehammer would share 
venues with the entire valley, which covers 72 miles and includes two larger 
cities, Hamar and Gjovik, each of which has a population of about 26,000. On 
the region's primary highway, a two-lane farm-to-market road that is often icy 
and always congested with trucks, travel is tedious. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government also responded to pressure from environmentalists, 
insisting that organizers stage the greenest Games ever. The site of the 
speedskating venue in Hamar was altered to leave a bird sanctuary undisturbed; 
a hockey rink in Gjovik was constructed inside a mountain, and fines of up to 
$10,000 were assessed for cutting down trees unnecessarily. 
</P>
<P>
 Suspecting that ski resorts in other parts of Norway were siding with 
environmentalists in an attempt to prevent one from being built in his city, 
the mayor of Ringebu, site of much of the Alpine skiing, pulled the cord on the 
chain saw that brought down the first tree there. In the subsequent election, 
his opponent labeled him "the Chopper of Ringebu." 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor kept his job, but other politicians in the region who fought the 
environmentalists did not. A poll in Norway revealed that 67% of the people 
considered protecting the environment the number one aim of the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 In return for its interference, the federal government picked up most of the 
tab for the $1.05-billion budget, which is four times higher than originally 
projected. 
</P>
<P>
 The people here have not complained about the expense, perhaps because they 
expect to get rich. Tourists complain about the high prices, such as $8 glasses 
of beer, $3 cups of coffee and $600 hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials, pointing out that Norway is one of the world's most 
expensive countries, report that they have found few instances of 
price-gouging, but LOOC's president, Gerhard Heiberg, warned: "Prices are too 
high. These people are cutting off the branch they are sitting on." 
</P>
<P>
 Heiberg, however, predicted that these Olympics will be remembered as the best 
ever "just out of the sheer joy of our people." 
</P>
<P>
 That might not be apparent to visitors because of the stereotypical Norwegian 
stoicism. A local businessman donated $70,000 to send merchants from the region 
to a charm school, which included a course in smiling. Only six enrolled. Time 
Difference 
</P>
<P>
 Norway is nine hours ahead of Pacific time. So, when it is 8 p.m. in Southern 
California, it is 5 a.m. in Lillehammer.

JIM MURRAY: YOU NEVER SEE MOVES LIKE THIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have a confession to make. All my life what I really wanted to be was an 
opera singer.  
</P>
<P>
 But that's not unusual. Almost everyone wants to be something he's not. 
Placido Domingo probably wants to be a sportswriter.  
</P>
<P>
 I have known movie stars -- Paul Newman comes to mind -- who would rather be 
race drivers. Jockeys probably wish they could be basketball players. We all 
fantasize about being something else. Bartenders want to be Secretary of State. 
Secretaries of State probably dream of owning a bar. 
</P>
<P>
 But when you're the best in the world at what you do, why wouldn't you let it 
go at that? Accept what you are? Get on with it? 
</P>
<P>
 Let me ask you something. Has there ever been anyone who played basketball 
better than Michael Jordan? Did God give him some of the most extraordinary 
talents ever visited on a human being? Like, almost the ability to fly? I mean, 
how many people do you know right offhand who can hang in the air for minutes 
at a time or soar along like a 747 defiant of gravity? You ever see anyone who 
can hover in the air like Mary Poppins, only he doesn't need the umbrella? He's 
"Air Jordan." He's the identified flying object. He should be licensed as an 
aircraft.  
</P>
<P>
 You'd think that would be enough for him. Take the money and jump. Stay at 
what you do best. I mean, did Edison take up channel-swimming? 
</P>
<P>
 But no. Michael got bored up there. He was so good, it got monotonous. 
</P>
<P>
 So, he wanted a career change. OK. Happens to a lot of people. A doctor 
recently moved over to be a rap musician. Lawyers turn newscasters. Prime 
ministers take up painting. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe you think Michael wants a career in politics? Wants to be governor? 
</P>
<P>
 Nope. Michael wants to be a baseball player. You heard me. He wants to opt for 
that quaint turn-of-the-century sport where three strikes you're out, the ball 
is only five inches and you have no 24-second clock.  
</P>
<P>
 It's a strange career choice. Look, if you stopped 10 kids on a playground 
anywhere in this country and asked them which sport they would rather star in, 
basketball or baseball, chances are eight out of 10, or more, would answer 
basketball. If you asked them which they would rather be, Michael Jordan or 
Barry Bonds, they might say, "Barry Who?" It wouldn't surprise me if Barry 
Bonds said he'd rather be a basketball player.  
</P>
<P>
 Pro basketball is the "in" sport. Baseball is having trouble keeping its TV 
contracts, its grip on the public generally.  
</P>
<P>
 Michael Jordan has always been restive. Not so long ago, his sport of choice 
seemed to be golf. He thought he might be the next Jack Nicklaus. Until a few 
million-dollar Nassaus disabused him. I mean, if he couldn't beat a small-time 
hustler out of San Diego, what would he do with the real Jack Nicklaus? 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball should be flattered. The greatest basketball player, by common 
consent, of all the ages of the game has opted for the grand old game. You 
couldn't script one better than that. Holy hot dog! Buy me some peanuts and 
Crackerjack, I'm going to go out and see Michael Jordan try to hit a knuckler, 
do to Roger Clemens what he did to Charles Barkley.  
</P>
<P>
 You have to admire Jordan's chutzpah. At stake, no less, is his reputation as 
an all-time athlete.  
</P>
<P>
 I have regarded Jackie Robinson as the greatest athlete I have ever seen for 
one reason: He could play and excel in major league baseball. He could hit the 
curveball, which Ted Williams said is the single most difficult thing to do in 
sports. Sports lore has it that Jim Thorpe was the greatest athlete who ever 
lived -- until they found out he couldn't hit the major league curveball.  
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Robinson could. It separated him from the field. He could run track 
(sprints, long jump) at an Olympian level, he was a great basketball player, an 
All-American in football -- and he could hit the curve.  
</P>
<P>
 Can Michael Jordan? I hope so. But I doubt it.  
</P>
<P>
 You see, you get to be a major league baseball player not by walking off the 
half-court line in Chicago Stadium and putting on a uniform that says "White 
Sox" across the front.  
</P>
<P>
 You become a ballplayer by playing in the Sally League (or its modern 
equivalent) or the American Assn. or the Pacific Coast League till you hone 
your skills, get smart, learn what pitches to jump on and which to lay off. And 
so on. It's a little like diamond-cutting. You need an apprenticeship. And 
today, it seems, you need to be second-generation.  
</P>
<P>
 It's not lightly learned. Only a handful of players ever started out at the 
major league level and stayed there. Sandy Koufax comes to mind. But even Babe 
Ruth started in the minors. Jackie Robinson started in the Negro Leagues.  
</P>
<P>
 Nine years in the NBA hardly qualifies. You can't dunk a baseball any more 
than you can a putt.  
</P>
<P>
 There is an additional consideration: Michael Jordan is 6 feet 6.  
</P>
<P>
 That, dear fans, is a lot of strike zone. That gives a pitcher a lot of real 
estate around the plate. I mean, he can throw a pitch that is almost impossible 
to hit -- and it can still be a strike. Don't look for Michael Jordan to get a 
lot of unintentional bases on balls. Don't look for him to get a lot of good 
pitches to hit.  
</P>
<P>
 Does this mean Michael Jordan can't make it? Well, put it this way: I 
certainly hope he can. I cannot think of a greater shot in the arm for the 
national pastime. I hope he's Babe Ruth. Or Jackie Robinson.

<P>
 Do I think he can? Regrettably, in a word, no. 
</P>
<P>
 But I'll tell you one thing: If he makes it, I'm going down to the 
Metropolitan Opera first thing the very next morning.

WAITING FOR HIS PITCH; DODGERS MIGHT HAVE TO CHANGE THEIR WAY OF DOING BUSINESS 
TO SIGN MIKE PIAZZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 They spent about an hour together, poring over yellowing scrapbooks and 
talking about the Babe as if he were the next-door neighbor. Mike Piazza was 
curious if Martha Berger's husband ever said much about Joe DiMaggio; Martha 
explained that DiMaggio was just coming up when Wally played. But the Babe, 
well, he and Wally were close. They had lived together in the same apartment 
house when they played together for the Boston Braves. 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza smiled. "Let's hear those stories," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was more than just being neighbors in Manhattan Beach that brought Martha 
Berger and Piazza together recently at her beach cottage, where she has 
continued to live since Wally's death six years ago. Toward the end of last 
season, Piazza was chasing Berger's National League rookie records for home 
runs and runs batted in, which Berger has held since 1930. Piazza fell three 
short of Berger's and Frank Robinson's 38 home runs, and drove in 112 runs to 
Berger's 119, but his numbers were still enough for him to be unanimously voted 
rookie of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a remarkable ending to a tumultuous season for the Dodgers and Piazza, 
who set all kinds of team rookie records. He excelled on a team mired in 
mediocrity on the field and burdened with tragedies off it. Piazza played 
tenaciously through the final game of the season, when he finally was given 
center stage in a 12-1 pounding of the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Many times after that game, Piazza said he wasn't sure when any of his 
accomplishments would sink in, or if they ever would. But by the time he 
visited Berger's house one January afternoon, the season tucked away in his own 
mental scrapbook, the reality of baseball as a business had already affected 
his spirit. Accomplishments aside, Piazza is learning quickly that some things 
never change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even with what Wally accomplished, $12,000 was the most he ever made," Martha 
Berger said. "In Wally's days, they didn't have agents. He had to do everything 
himself. And they would always tell him, 'There is no money.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza picked up a book about Berger from the dining room table. Leafing 
through it, he stumbled on a letter Berger had written in 1931 to Emil E. 
Fuchs, then president of the Boston Braves, when Berger was trying to get a 
raise. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'I know the amount that I am asking of you sounds like a large jump but I 
feel that I drew enough fans through the gate and was popular enough with the 
Boston fans to be worth $10,000 a year to your club,' " Piazza read out loud. " 
'Now Judge, don't think me fatheaded, but just look things over and if you were 
in my position, would you take a cent less than $10,000 a year?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza closed the book and looked at Martha. "I admire him for doing this," he 
said. "Maybe I should read this book and get some pointers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The one thing you don't want to mess with is Piazza's feelings. He's so 
sensitive, he could seemingly hold a grudge long into a decade. He's a player 
who beats his batting helmet unmercifully when he goes one for three. Call him 
moody, he'll agree. Call him intense, he'll nod. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't care what you call him, just respect him.  
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I do equate respect with pay," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 About a week after Piazza visited Berger's house, he and his agent, Dennis 
Gilbert, met with Dodger officials to talk about Piazza's 1994 contract. As a 
second-year player, Piazza is at the Dodgers' mercy. They can renew his salary 
of $126,000, raise him or even cut him 20%. All Piazza can do to protest is not 
play. In recent years, Fernando Valenzuela held out after the 1981 season; 
Ramon Martinez held out after the 1991 season and Pedro Guerrero, well, that's 
another story. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was excited to be included, because it was the first time they (the 
Dodgers) asked for a player to be in on that type of meeting, and I thought, 
well, it might be something special," Piazza said. "They might surprise me, 
maybe say, 'Mike, we appreciate everything you have done for the organization 
and we want you to be happy.' Then, what happened was so bizarre, disappointing 
and frustrating. It really set me back. Sent me soul-searching." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers, who have long adhered to the philosophy that no player is bigger 
than the organization, offered Piazza about $500,000 that day, using as a 
comparable salary the $435,000 they paid teammate Eric Karros after he won the 
1992 rookie-of-the-year award. But the key for the Dodgers is not statistics, 
but service time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers point to Ramon Martinez, who received $485,000 after the 1990 
season, after one-plus years of service. They mention Texas Ranger outfielder 
Juan Gonzalez, who received $280,000 after leading the team with 27 home runs 
and 102 RBIs his first season in 1991, and who received $525,000 after his 
second season, in which he hit 43 home runs in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, the Dodgers pay second-year players higher salaries than most 
other clubs, barring those signed to a multiyear contract -- a philosophy they 
do not subscribe to. The $500,000 offered to Piazza would put him among the 
top-paid second-year players. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a reason we included Mike in that meeting," said Fred Claire, 
Dodger executive vice president. "Mike had a great year, and we wanted to tell 
him how much we appreciated it. We wanted to let him know we were not 
interested in a multiyear deal at this time, not that we won't be in the 
future. And we wanted him to understand our approach in negotiations, and that 
is that players with one-year service time will be paid according to the system 
that is in place. 
</P>
<P>
 "After three years, players have arbitration, and after six years, they have 
free agency. That's the structure of the collective bargaining agreement," 
Claire said. "We have had players who have had outstanding first seasons, not 
that I'm comparing Mike because his accomplishments were great, but we have 
paid our players well. Eric Karros and Ramon Martinez are good examples of 
players we paid well after their first seasons, and they (were) among the 
top-paid players in the game with one-plus years of service." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert, though, is comparing Piazza to Chicago White Sox first baseman Frank 
Thomas, who hit .318 in 158 games with 32 home runs and 109 runs batted in 
during his first full season of 1991 and was given a three-year contract worth 
$4 million. Piazza hit .318 in 149 games with 35 homers and 112 RBIs. Karros 
hit .257 in 149 games with 20 homers and 88 RBIs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thomas' contract was a multiyear deal, and what the White Sox did was to buy 
out arbitration," Claire said.  
</P>
<P>
 But because the Dodgers had recently paid a $1.2-million bonus to an amateur 
Korean pitcher and $1.3 million to Darren Dreifort, their 1993 No. 1 draft 
choice, Piazza had higher hopes. He would like about $1 million. The Dodgers 
say paying bonus money is different than the system applying to Piazza. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the problem is, they came to us, and we told them that they paid 
Darren $1.3 million and Chan Ho $1.2 million and last year Ryan Luzinski 
$500,000," Piazza said. "They said that is like comparing apples and oranges 
because these guys were draft picks. We said, 'Look at the contract that Frank 
Thomas got after his first full year instead of the one you gave Eric Karros.'  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to say that I'm a better player than Eric; he's a very good 
friend. I love him like a brother. But when you look at the numbers, I think 
that's like comparing apples and oranges. If I had only hit two or three home 
runs more than Eric, or if my average was only 10 points higher, I would 
understand. But my numbers are there. My numbers are almost identical to 
Thomas' " 
</P>
<P>
 The day after the meeting, Piazza didn't show up for the voluntary workout at 
Dodger Stadium. A few days later, he left for Philadelphia to spend time with 
his family, a trip that was previously planned. The Dodgers and Gilbert have 
had more talks, but Gilbert says nothing has changed.  
</P>
<P>
 "Fred Claire and (counsel) Sam Fernandez are smart people, and I anticipate 
them doing the right thing," Gilbert said. "I'm hopeful it will be resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 So Piazza remains in Philadelphia, where he is working out daily, hitting two 
hours in his own batting cage and spending time in a gym. He hopes that the 
contract is settled before Feb. 17, when pitchers and catchers report to Vero 
Beach. He wouldn't become an official holdout until March 1.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not making any threats -- we have some time left," Piazza said. "Dennis 
and Dan (Lozano, Gilbert's assistant) are in touch with me off and on, and I 
hope we get something done soon.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not looking to break new ground. I'm not looking to go to the moon. I 
just want to be rewarded and supported for the year that I had and what I 
hopefully will do next season. I wouldn't go that far now to say I'm going to 
hold out. That's too premature. I realize it is a business. I'm just a little 
bit disappointed. It's going to take some time for me to sort it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone familiar with Piazza's intensity is wondering how his psyche will be 
affected if negotiations drag out. Gilbert believes Piazza is mature enough to 
handle the negotiation process. Claire says playing baseball and contract 
negotiations are separate issues. Piazza doesn't want to think that far ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deep down inside, I want Eric (Karros) and I to continue to go out and play 
hard and be the foundation of this team for years to come," Piazza said. "We 
have proven we can play on this level, and now we need to step up and lead a 
little more. I'm kind of torn. I want to get (the contract) done and get down 
there and start working, but I also want what's fair." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Philadelphia, Piazza said, he isn't as recognized as he is in Los Angeles. 
He's starting to get used to people he has never seen before addressing him by 
his first name, as in, "More water, Mike?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you hear that?" Piazza said recently at a Southland restaurant. "He 
called me Mike." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the best parts of fame, as Piazza sees it, are those people who know 
who he is but respect his right to be out in public. "It's an adjustment you 
have to make, but people are pretty cool," he said. "I think the funniest thing 
I always hear is when people approach me to talk or sign an autograph and say, 
'You are probably sick of this, but . . . ' And I say, 'No, I'm not sick of 
this, I'm sick of people telling me I am probably sick of this.' " 
</P>
<P>
 There's also the down side, such as the kid who followed him through LAX 
recently, yelling at the top of his lungs, "There Mike Piazza, there's Mike 
Piazza."  
</P>
<P>
 "He followed me all the way to the baggage claim," Piazza said. "It was 
scary." 
</P>
<P>
 Lozano, Gilbert's assistant, said the attention Piazza gets is on a superstar 
level. "I've done a lot of things with Jose Canseco, and Mike gets attention 
the way Jose does, where people can be somewhat frantic about him," Lozano 
said. "It doesn't matter where we are, if he is there, it's more than just to 
get his autograph. People want to be around him, they want to talk to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Appearance requests for Piazza this winter have been overwhelming, but he 
chose carefully, keeping them to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept it kind of low, because I am preparing to play and that is my No. 1 
job," Piazza said. "I turned down a lot of things. I'm kind of superstitious in 
my season preparations, and I wanted to do the same things I did before last 
season. But I did the MTV Rock and Jock softball game, that was fun. And I just 
finished a commercial.  
</P>
<P>
 "Those kinds of things the fans like to see and I enjoy doing. I also enjoyed 
going to the hospital to see children and the people, to see the strength they 
have after what they have to go through. And I use that strength toward 
baseball. I feed off of that. It's a small thing you can do, but it gives me 
something, too. It's a trade-off." 
</P>
<P>
 All business on the field, Piazza is mostly business off the field, at least 
during the season. He loves heavy-metal music and likes to play the drums, but 
almost everything he does revolves around the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I become a different person when I'm playing," he said. "I'm like 
anybody else when I'm not playing. I like to unwind, go out and have fun. But 
when I'm playing, it's like I'm Jekyll and Hyde. It's no nonsense. I don't like 
to fool around. I hate to say it, but it's a job, and you need to prepare 
yourself and play with that intensity between the lines.  
</P>
<P>
 "During the season, I don't like to do anything. I eat, sleep, go to the 
ballpark. I feel uncomfortable saying no to all the things that are asked of 
me, but you have to do that to keep your sanity. There is a fine line, and 
there are some very good causes and you have to make some time to do those 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to continue to be positive for the Dodgers. I feel like Los Angeles 
has adopted me as a native son, and this whole thing that's happening with my 
contract is just a small bump in the road.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's unfortunate it has to happen, but it's not a perfect world."

MARYLAND'S CLOCK IS TICKING ON LURING A TEAM TO BALTIMORE; FOOTBALL: IF RAMS OR 
RAIDERS HAVE DESIGNS ON RELOCATING, THEY MIGHT HAVE TO MEET A FEB. 15 DEADLINE 
FOR A STADIUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The window of opportunity for either the Raiders or the Rams to move to 
Baltimore will be slammed shut in nine days, says the governor of Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not optimistic that . . . something will be finalized," Governor William 
D. Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Shaw, Ram executive vice president, has met with officials of the 
Maryland Stadium Authority. The Raiders won't concede that they have even made 
contact with officials from Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not aware of any conversations with Baltimore officials," said Al 
LoCasale, Raider executive assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke insists those conversations have taken place. 
Schmoke stressed that they occurred before Los Angeles was hit with an 
earthquake on Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to get into a situation where it would look like we are 
capitalizing on Los Angeles' misery," Schmoke told the Baltimore Sun. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step in a move to Baltimore would be for one of the teams to send a 
letter declaring serious intent to relocate. If that doesn't happen by Feb. 15, 
the $160 million in Maryland funds earmarked for a new stadium in the Camden 
Yard area of downtown can be diverted. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaefer would like to see the money used to build an arena to lure an NBA or 
NHL team. 
</P>
<P>
 Other groups are also expected to put in bids for the funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaefer said that, if no club responds by Feb. 15, he will support Washington 
Redskin owner Jack Kent Cooke, who wants to build a new stadium in Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do know that two teams will move within a year," Schaefer said. 
</P>
<P>
 He would not, however, identify the teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore is offering the new stadium to a team at a cost of $1 per year in 
rent. The club will get all ticket revenues, including those from luxury boxes, 
and all revenues from parking and concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore officials are also courting the Canadian Football League, but not 
with the same lucrative offer. Should their attempt to get an NFL team fail, 
city officials would try to get a CFL team to play in Memorial Stadium, home of 
the Baltimore Colts before the team moved to Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 While they won't concede they are looking outside Los Angeles, the Raiders 
can't say with certainty where they will be playing in 1994. The earthquake 
damaged the Coliseum so badly that its availability for the upcoming season is 
in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Oakland, former home of the Raiders, has offered its stadium as a 
temporary home, but that suggestion was met with less than enthusiasm by Yvonne 
Brathwaite Burke, president of the Coliseum Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the lack of luxury boxes in the 71-year-old Coliseum and poor 
attendance at Raider games, there have been constant rumors and speculation 
that the team will move. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, unhappy with Anaheim Stadium, will invoke the escape clause in their 
lease on May 3, but haven't firmly committed to leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram officials have said they have no intention of moving up their timetable 
because of the upcoming Maryland deadline.

MORNING BRIEFING: THEY'D HAVE HAD LITTLE USE FOR 'BIG BERTHA' 
</P>

 Shiny sticks will be out en masse Wednesday when the pro-amateur launches the 
Nissan L.A. Open at Riveria Country Club, the oldest civic-sponsored tournament 
on the PGA Tour. But a look back reveals that you don't always need expensive 
golf equipment to be a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1938, Jimmy Thompson won the championship with a putter he bought for $1. 
In 1941, Johnny Bulla won with bargain golf balls bought over the counter at 
Walgreen's Drug Store. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Add Open: It took the first 42 years of the tournament for the 
purses, added together, to total more than $1 million. Now, the total purse for 
each year's L.A. Open is $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Lighthorse Harry Cooper, winner of the first tournament in 1926, earned 
$3,500. This year, the 44th-place finisher will receive that much. And the 
winner? $180,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who was the first and only woman to qualify and play in the L.A. 
Open? 
</P>
<P>
 Pretty funny: Troy Aikman was a guest on the "Tonight Show" the other night, 
and during the monologue, Jay Leno said: "You know my favorite part of the 
whole Super Bowl was at the end of the game when Troy Aikman was knocked down 
by a photographer. Did you see that? The photographer knocked him right down. 
In fact, right after it happened, five Buffalo players ran up to the 
photographer and asked: 'Hey, how'd you do that?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Teeth fetish: Jo Lasorda says that if there is one thing her husband Tom is 
good about, it's cleaning his teeth. "You know those little floss things you 
get from the dentist? Well, Tommy has so many of them that when you open the 
medicine cabinet, they all fall out," she says. "He spends so much time on his 
teeth that at night I tell him, 'Dad, go get your teeth done so I don't have to 
hear the water running so long.' You know how it's the little things that can 
bug you." 
</P>
<P>
 One man's opinion: Tom Keegan of the Southtown Economist in Chicago, on 
Michael Jordan's tryout with the White Sox: "A ploy to sell tickets? I think 
not. The Bulls are more exciting without Jordan, so how can the White Sox be 
more exciting with him?" 
</P>
<P>
 On the map: Jordan says he would go to the minors if he has to, prompting 
Steve Shaad, general manager of the Class AA Wichita Wranglers to say that 
Jordan can play in Kansas if his attempt to make the White Sox roster doesn't 
work out. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Shaad: "Chicago was a one-horse town before Michael arrived. He would 
have a similar impact on Wichita." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Jordan: General Manager Ron Schueler pitched to Jordan in batting 
practice. But Larry Stone of the San Francisco Examiner suggests that it might 
have been a better test to pit Jordan against Schueler's 18-year old daughter, 
Carey. An accomplished athlete, Carey Schueler was actually drafted by the 
White Sox in the 43rd round last year as a left-handed pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope he's better than this: The Pittsburgh Pirates had an outfielder in 1890 
named Michael Jordan, who batted .096 in 37 games and struck out 19 times. He 
did, however, steal five bases.  
</P>
<P>
 12 He'll try anything: In 1991, then Wichita Wrangler outfielder Darrell 
Sherman was ejected from a game for throwing a bat onto the field. So Shaad 
thought he would capitalize with a Darrell Sherman Bat Throw contest the next 
night. Six fans were selected to throw a bat from the dugout steps onto the 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fourth guy, a left-hander, looked like he had been drinking a little," 
Shaad told The Times' Mike DiGiovanna. "He was aiming for the pitcher's mound, 
but hurled the bat up into the stands down the first-base side. I saw my 
sports-promotion life flash before my eyes. It was a definite lawsuit. 
Fortunately, the bat landed in a bank of empty seats. Just another stupid, 
off-the-cuff promotion." 
</P>
<P>
 Greying whiskers: Former relief pitcher Rollie Fingers, known for his 
handlebar mustache, recently took part in promoting a new brush-in color gel 
for men's facial hair. Said Fingers: "I've had my mustache for years. I grew it 
in '72 when we (the Oakland A's) won the World Series, so I kept it and we won 
in '73, then again in '74. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did come close to shaving it off once when I lost both ends of a 
doubleheader against Baltimore. I put the razor to my nose but I just couldn't 
do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Fingers: "People come up to me all the time and say, 'You've got a 
mustache just like Rollie Fingers,' " Fingers said. "They obviously recognize 
my mustache more than they do me." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Mildred (Babe) Didrickson in 1938. 
</P>

inexpensive motels: "Maybe I'm a miser, but all you need is a toilet, bed and 
TV." MARYANN HUDSON

MIKE DOWNEY: CHIPPING AWAY AT A NEW JOB

 Now that Dan Quayle has done a potato-chip advertisement for the Super Bowl 
football telecast, well, other offers have simply been pouring in. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dear Mr. Vice President: 
</P>
<P>
 On behalf of the Nike corporation, may we say how natural and convincing you 
were in your TV commercial for Wavy Lay's potato chips. You were, as we say 
here in the ad biz, boffo. 
</P>
<P>
 Our principal advertising agency, Maykum Lykett & Paye, is eager to run a new 
idea up your flagpole. 
</P>
<P>
 As you know, our "Nothing but Net" ads featuring Michael Jordan and Larry Bird 
have become wildly popular. Surely you have seen our spots in which Mike and 
Larry try to outdo one another by shooting a basketball from off a rooftop, 
over a freeway, through a window, off Mt. Rushmore, etc., etc., hitting 
"nothing but net." 
</P>
<P>
 We would like you to shoot against Mike and Larry in our next ad.

TURNING 40 IS A MAJOR EVENT; TOM KITE, STILL WINNING, DEFENDS HIS L.A. OPEN 
TITLE THIS WEEK AT RIVIERA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ROBLEDO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The prevailing theory on the PGA Tour is that you must accomplish as much as 
possible by 40. 
</P>
<P>
 If goals haven't been attained by then, they probably won't be. 
</P>
<P>
 All that's left, presumably, are 10 years of missing cuts against steadily 
improving fields while trying to keep your game together for the Senior PGA 
Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 The exception is Tom Kite, defending champion in the Nissan Los Angeles Open, 
who turned his game up a couple of notches when he turned 40 four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 If Kite comes close to performing this week at Riviera Country Club the way he 
was playing a year ago, he can become the first player to win consecutive L.A. 
Opens since Arnold Palmer did it at Rancho Park in 1966-67 and the first to 
repeat at Riviera since Ben Hogan in 1947-48. 
</P>
<P>
 Kite left his mark on the Southland last winter. He opened with a second place 
in the Tournament of Champions at La Costa; won the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic 
at PGA West in La Quinta in mid-February with a 35-under-par 325, a record for 
a 90-hole tournament; and two weeks later won the rain-shortened Los Angeles 
Open with a 54-hole score of seven-under-par 206. 
</P>
<P>
 Kite opened in Los Angeles with a 73, but bounced back with a 66 and a 67. On 
the last day, he came from behind with a 31 on the back nine with a 
demonstration of precise iron play to beat defending champion Fred Couples, 
Payne Stewart, Donnie Hammond and Dave Barr by three strokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad for a guy everybody was feeling sorry for in 1988 and '89, when he was 
known as the best player never to win a major. 
</P>
<P>
 Kite was particularly proud of the streak he had going into '88. He had won at 
least one tournament seven years in a row. But it had been nagging him that 
none of the victories were in major championships. Then that year, he earned 
$760,405 without winning a tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 He had one final chance to extend his winning streak in the Nabisco 
Championships at Pebble Beach, the last event of the year. But he lost a 
sudden-death playoff to Curtis Strange. 
</P>
<P>
 At 38, Kite's streak of winning at least one tournament annually came to an 
end. 
</P>
<P>
 He promised himself that Tom Kite was not through, that he had merely stumbled 
on a bump in the road. 
</P>
<P>
 If that was a bump, his loss in the 1989 U.S. Open at Oak Hill Country Club in 
Rochester, N.Y., was a brick wall. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't get many chances at winning a U.S. Open, and Kite had a golden one. 
He had a one-stroke lead going into the final round and increased it to four 
with 14 holes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came a disastrous fifth hole on which he twice hit into water and wound 
up with a triple-bogey to bring Strange and the rest of the contenders back to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 He still had the lead, but after bogeys at the eighth and 10th holes, Kite 
felt it slipping away. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a stroke behind when he double-bogeyed the 13th and went on to shoot 
78. He could have won his first U.S. Open with a two-over-par 73. 
</P>
<P>
 At 39, that could have been the end of his serious major championship 
aspirations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kite wasn't thinking that way. He came to the press tent and told what it 
felt like to blow a U.S. Open. "It's just a U.S. Open," he said. "I will 
survive it. It was a fluke. I'll come back and contend in more majors, I 
promise you." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a brave moment, even if the promise seemed hollow. 
</P>
<P>
 He was about to turn 40, and even the great ones have had problems after 40. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Nicklaus has won only four PGA Tour events since his 40th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnold Palmer, who won 41 times as a 30-something golfer, won only six after 
reaching 40. Two of them were in team events with Nicklaus as his partner. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Trevino added five victories to his regular-tour ledger after 40; Raymond 
Floyd won only four more times. 
</P>
<P>
 Kite, 44, has already won six tournaments, one of them a major, since turning 
40. 
</P>
<P>
 That elusive major championship came in 1992 in the U.S. Open at Pebble Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an extraordinary performance under grueling conditions as Kite battled 
strong winds off Carmel Bay and demon thoughts that kept popping into his head. 
</P>
<P>
 The turning point in his round of 72 on the final day came at the 107-yard 
seventh hole. After the wind blew his tee shot into the rough, Kite hit a flop 
shot from 20 yards that carried a bunker and rolled into the cup for a birdie 
on a hole that was yielding mostly bogeys and doubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Kite remembered the wedge shot Tom Watson had made from the rough at the 17th 
to set up his U.S. Open victory on the same course in 1982, but this one was 
different: Watson had one hole to play; Kite had the toughest part of the 
course ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 For the remaining 11 holes, Kite battled the course and negative thoughts of 
previous disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was over, and he was the U.S. Open champion, he would finally admit: 
"It was bugging the living daylights out of me." Tom Kite was no longer the 
best player never to win a major. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that he has one major to his credit, he thinks about winning more. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not? He still believes he is improving, and has a record that backs him 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview in Golf Digest last September, he was asked if he had to work 
harder after he turned 40 to keep his competitive edge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't work harder," he said. "I have always worked hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Kite added that players who thought they had to work harder might not have 
worked hard enough in the first place. He questions whether golfers who don't 
like to practice are really trying to be as good as they can be. 
</P>
<P>
 Some players cut back on their schedules when they get older because they want 
to be fresher for each event they enter. 
</P>
<P>
 Kite is unwilling to experiment with this. His way works and he sees no reason 
to change. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Nicklaus, satisfied with the way he is striking the ball, has entered the 
Los Angeles Open -- his first appearance in the tournament since 1978. Riviera 
is one of the few great courses on which Nicklaus has never won. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Nicklaus' sons, Gary, 25, will also play after getting one of seven 
exemptions. The others were granted to professionals Bob Burns of Valencia, 
Mike Donald, Yoshinori Mizumaki and Bobby Wadkins, and amateurs Ted Oh of 
Torrance and Chris Tidland of Placentia. 
</P>
<P>
 Festivities begin today with a celebrity-amateur round, then the professionals 
will arrive and begin practice rounds Monday. The Merrill Lynch nine-hole 
Shootout is the Tuesday feature, followed by the pro-amateur Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-day tournament begins Thursday.

POINT OF VIEW / BOB OATES; KICK OUT THE WALLS; HOW TO END THE NFL'S SCORING 
SLUMP AND ENCOURAGE OFFENSIVE COACHES TO TRY HARDER: ENLARGE THE END ZONES, 
WIDEN THE GRIDIRON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bob Oates 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the start, football has been a game of change. 
</P>
<P>
 More than perhaps any other game, it has repeatedly reinvented itself. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet at times, after more than 700 rule changes in its first century, it 
has failed to change fast enough. In the NFL, this is one of those times. 
</P>
<P>
 Touchdowns were drastically down again this past season, the nation's most 
gifted offensive players frustrated by steadily improving defenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, NFL teams scored 1,164 touchdowns. This season, they scored 
906. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a dramatic rise in field goals, annoying those spectators who 
maintain that if you've seen one field goal, you've seen them all. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the first 16-game season in 1978, field goals have jumped from 427 to a 
record 673. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the league's most talented six or seven teams played a little better 
in January -- when the playoff coaches, taking their best shots, opened up a 
bit -- the cheering did not drown out the regular-season complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 The league heard a steady drumbeat of criticism from August to the final days 
of the regular season, when eight pro clubs, in one weekend, compiled this 
dismal file: New England Patriots 7, Cincinnati Bengals 2; Tampa Bay Buccaneers 
13, Chicago Bears 10; Buffalo Bills 10, Philadelphia Eagles 7, and New York 
Jets 3, Washington Redskins 0. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, during a December interlude that wasn't greatly different from 
earlier weekends this fall, one-fourth of all NFL teams scored an average 6.5 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a touchdown problem, and we've got to do something about it," NFL 
Commissioner Paul Tagliabue said the other day in Atlanta, commenting on 
season-long warnings of trouble ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the warnings took the form of wild and crazy suggestions from fans and 
critics who, among other things, would abolish zone defenses . . . or forbid 
all contact with quarterbacks after the ball has been thrown . . . or forbid 
all contact with receivers before the catch . . . or award points for first 
downs or crossing the 10-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a better idea. 
</P>
<P>
 At next month's annual meeting, the league's rulemakers -- the 30 club owners 
-- can end the touchdown crisis with one simple change. 
</P>
<P>
 What NFL offensive players need most is more elbow room. They have simply 
outgrown the field, which should be bigger. SPRINTER VS. SPRINTER 
</P>
<P>
 Unchanged in length and width since 1903, the playing field needs to be wider, 
and it needs deeper end zones. 
</P>
<P>
 The players are unimaginably faster than they were in the early 1900s, when 
football was still being invented. They are also awesomely larger and stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 For defensive stars in particular, playing football today is like pitching 
horseshoes on a half-size court. 
</P>
<P>
 The field wasn't always so small. 
</P>
<P>
 When American football began to evolve out of British soccer and rugby in the 
final years of the 19th Century, all three sports were played on grounds that 
were considerably longer and wider than the present American field. 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans, for various reasons, downsized, deciding on a 100-yard 
playground with end zones 10 yards deep. 
</P>
<P>
 So, there is precedent for changing it again. If they could shrink the 
playground, they can enlarge it. 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously, the width of the American field, 53 1/3 yards, was arrived at as a 
matter of necessity. A field that wide was the largest that would fit in 
Harvard Stadium, which in 1903 became, and ever since has been, home to Harvard 
football. 
</P>
<P>
 There was an accompanying serendipitous effect: The smaller playing surface 
proved to be the making of the American game. 
</P>
<P>
 As football developed into a nationwide pastime, it was played by those who 
had just the right speed and size for a Harvard-type field. 
</P>
<P>
 Even until quite recently, the game's fastest running backs were known as 
10-second men in tribute to their ability to proceed 100 yards in 10 seconds, 
more or less. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, some defensive linemen and linebackers are that fast. And there are 
defensive backs who approach 10 seconds for 100 meters. 
</P>
<P>
 As for height and bulk, more than one good football player 90 or 100 years ago 
was a five-footer weighing in the 150s. Big players stood about 5 feet 10 and 
weighed in at 190 or 195. 
</P>
<P>
 When former NFL coach Clark Shaughnessy was a college fullback on the 1913 
Minnesota team known as the "Giants of the North," he weighed an even 200 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I was the biggest man on the team," he used to say. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern NFL players, many of them, stand 6-3 or more and weigh 300 pounds or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL's really fast players are the defensive backs, who have the speed to 
catch a receiver whose Olympic speed is blunted a bit by pads and the 
requirement that he pack a ball under his arm. 
</P>
<P>
 With so many sprinters facing one another on the same old field -- a field now 
crowded with giants -- it can't come as a surprise that total points are down. 
And falling. DEFENSIVE TAKEOVER 
</P>
<P>
 One extraordinary thing about football is that rule changes enacted to benefit 
offensive teams tend to make only a temporary difference. 
</P>
<P>
 The defenses always catch up. Thus, the game has had to be re-created 
periodically. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been done each time with new rules -- often radical changes such as 
those legalizing blocking, outlawing the flying wedge, authorizing forward 
passes or sanctioning free substitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Revolutionary in their time, all of these changes were outdated eventually by 
clever defensive players and coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it is that without another meaningful change soon, pro football is 
heading again for the kind of trouble it most recently had 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, an ominous decline in touchdowns was reversed only with a dozen 
significant rule revisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The league's 1970s owners legalized offensive holding -- for the most part -- 
and curtailed, among other things, bump-and-run bumps, head slaps, head blows, 
excessive abuse of quarterbacks and other impediments to offensive mobility. 
</P>
<P>
 But the defenses are getting back at offensive teams with zone defenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Barred from beating up on downfield receivers in man-to-man schemes, defenses 
have found that zones -- or, for variety, combination zone and man-to-man 
defenses -- are more effective now. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because NFL defensive backs are so much faster than they were only a 
few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The technical difference is in the size of the seams -- the space between 
defensive backs. 
</P>
<P>
 Most zone-defense backs worried, until recently, that their seams were too 
wide. They lacked the speed to get to a receiver who drifted into the middle of 
a seam. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's faster defensive players can get there easily. As they say, they have 
shrunk the seams. 
</P>
<P>
 This is most disturbingly true from the goal line out to the 10- or 15-yard 
lines. There, not so long ago, no NFL team could afford to play zone defense. 
In that area, one completion in a seam meant a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 No more. 
</P>
<P>
 The sprinters in today's secondaries have proved that the best offensive teams 
can only rarely jam the ball into their shrunken seams. 
</P>
<P>
 And once more, the game is out of balance. A BIGGER CHESSBOARD 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball was the first of the major team sports to confront the problems 
created by modern athletes' greater height, weight, speed, quickness and 
athletic ability. 
</P>
<P>
 One night, basketball's leaders looked under the basket and found a multitude 
of giants who could just stand there and flick the ball in. 
</P>
<P>
 So they acted. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening a can of paint, they redrew the floor to keep the big men away from 
the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL, by expanding the field, could reach similar objectives. 
</P>
<P>
 And some of the league's coaches and players are in favor. Even some defensive 
players -- Ronnie Lott among them. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he might be professionally harmed, Lott, one of the finest defensive 
backs in NFL history, argues for wider fields and deeper end zones for the 
greater good of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a better game if the end zones were 15 yards deep instead of 10," 
he said. "Offensive teams can still get down the field now, sometimes, but they 
can't score. The end zone is loaded with defensive players who are much faster 
and more talented than they used to be." 
</P>
<P>
 They're standing there in all but impenetrable zone or combination defenses, 
said Lott, whose Hall of Fame career has reached from the San Francisco 49ers 
and the Raiders to the New York Jets, with whom he is planning on at least one 
more season. 
</P>
<P>
 "If world-class chess players wanted a bigger chessboard, they'd make it 
bigger, and we should do the same," he said  
</P>
<P>
 Lott's field would be four or five yards wider. Others suggest 10 yards. In 
time, no doubt, 10 will be needed -- meaning that it might be wisest to do it 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the end zone, (wider) fields would be a big help to the offense," Lott 
said. "The way it is now, when a quarterback has to throw into the end zone, 
what he sees is a seven-across defense, with the other four defensive players 
rushing at him. He has to throw quickly -- but most of the time there's no 
place to throw." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the league's passing experts who were in Atlanta for the Super Bowl 
agreed with Lott. Most defensive experts -- Maxie Baughan among them -- 
disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 A former Ram Pro Bowl star, now linebacker coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 
Baughan said: "What are you trying to do, get my job?" 
</P>
<P>
 Taking the other side, Kevin Gilbride, offensive coordinator of the Houston 
Oilers, said: "If they can't enlarge the field, it would help if they'd at 
least outlaw zone defenses from the 20-yard line in." 
</P>
<P>
 Outlawing zone defenses is, in fact, a frequently mentioned remedy. 
</P>
<P>
 But that would change the nature of football, and Lott represents a persuasive 
group opposing such changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm against a lot of new rules," he said. "Let's not make things harder on 
the officials. It would be a mistake to change the structure of the game by 
banning zone defenses, or awarding first-down points, things like that. You can 
accomplish the same thing by just enlarging the field a little." NO GIMMICKS, 
PLEASE 
</P>
<P>
 Three related questions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- What will larger fields accomplish?  
</P>
<P>
 The NFL's more imaginative and courageous coaches and players, when they have 
more room to work with, will make it a more open and stimulating game. And 
their reward will be more touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 That will require the other teams to go for touchdowns, too, resulting in a 
more interesting game. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't just low scoring that will be reversed, it's the recent trend to dumb 
football. 
</P>
<P>
 Current rules invite the coaches to run the ball twice, take a sack and summon 
a kicker. 
</P>
<P>
 A larger field will invite them to use their intelligence to create something 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 -- When the league's defensive coaches slow things down again, what next?  
</P>
<P>
 Field goals should then be devalued from three points to two -- encouraging 
offensive coaches to play for six points instead of two. 
</P>
<P>
 Many fans have called for other kinds of special-team changes: eliminating the 
extra point, adopting a two-point conversion or placing various restrictions on 
kickers. 
</P>
<P>
 But any repairs resting on historical foundations are preferable to gimmick 
fixes. 
</P>
<P>
 And to decrease the importance of field goals, football people have 
consistently favored a reduction in their value. The field goal was a 
five-point play in the 1890s, reduced to four points in 1904 and to three in 
1909 -- for the same reason each time: To diminish the bloated influence of the 
kickers. 
</P>
<P>
 -- What other NFL rule change would help?  
</P>
<P>
 Limiting substitutions would make football a more human game for players as 
well as spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 With frequent packages of substitutes rushing in from both sides, no fan can 
keep track of who's playing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the not-too-distant future, substitutions should be restricted to one per 
series. That's one new player for each side, maximum, after every first down. 
</P>
<P>
 It's true that football is most scientifically played with two platoons, 
offensive and defensive. 
</P>
<P>
 But it doesn't follow that unlimited substitution makes football more fun to 
watch -- whatever its attraction to coaches.

<P>
 As a spectator sport, to the contrary, the game is most appealing when the 
matchup is one team's best all-around offensive unit against the other team's 
best all-around defensive unit, as it was when two platoons were first 
authorized. 
</P>
<P>
 In that brief era, the fan could see who was excelling and who wasn't. And 
with limited substitution, that would be true again. Even on a larger 
chessboard. Especially on a larger chessboard.

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; AFTER FAST FALL TO BOTTOM, LAKERS FACE TOUGH CLIMB 
</P>

 Rebuilding, it's not as much fun as it looks: It's a new, dark day for the 
Lakers, now engaged in a battle for sixth place in the seven-team Pacific 
Division while the celebrities and many of their fans abandon the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Old Laker dynasts, unaccustomed to listless losses in empty halls, chafe at 
the process. Jerry Buss almost punched Randy Pfund's ticket last season. Jerry 
West has to put his fist in his mouth to keep from exploding. Magic Johnson 
went off last week, accusing the young Lakers of lacking pride, suggesting they 
weren't developing as fast as they should because they weren't working as hard 
as they should. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the progress of Doug Christie, and especially Anthony Peeler, has been 
uncertain but there are some fallacies at work, too, and you hear them all the 
time around the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers will get a lottery pick plus a free agent such as Danny Manning or 
Derrick Coleman and turn this thing back around in a year.  
</P>
<P>
 It's not that easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning seems to have turned his sights toward Orlando and Charlotte. Coleman 
is a thorny rose, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 You have to be lucky in the lottery. Ask the Sacramento Kings and Washington 
Bullets, who are in annually without ever getting the player they need. Even if 
there's another undergrad rush into the draft to beat the new collective 
bargaining agreement, this won't resemble the Shaquille O'Neal-Alonzo 
Mourning-Christian Laettner-Jim Jackson-Tom Gugliotta '92 crop. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers lack pride.  
</P>
<P>
 I don't want to endorse a lack of pride; pride means everything to good teams. 
The Lakers are a great player or two away from being a good team. Pride or lack 
thereof isn't their problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The young players aren't developing.  
</P>
<P>
 It's true, Peeler was such a disappointment after a fine rookie season, Pfund 
actually rejoiced when he learned he had a stress fracture in his foot; it 
explained why Peeler had stopped going to the basket. Christie looks like the 
second coming of Scottie Pippen one moment, a mad stork the next. Vlade Divac 
is Vlade Divac. Nick Van Exel is adventurous. For months George Lynch was known 
as "the 6-foot-6 power forward." 
</P>
<P>
 That's how it goes. It's easier to break in one young player like James 
Worthy, Byron Scott or A.C. Green slowly with a veteran nucleus than to break 
in a half-dozen kids all at once with no great player alongside for a role 
model.  
</P>
<P>
 Actually, as such things go, the Lakers are doing well. 
</P>
<P>
 Without having yet bottomed out -- remember, they still haven't missed the 
playoffs or drawn in the lottery -- they turned an old roster into a young one, 
with five players 26 or younger in regular rotation. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news for Laker fans, wherever you are, is not that they are losing a 
lot of games. It's that they may have a lot more to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Just because it's intolerable doesn't mean it has to be quick. THE CONTENDERS: 
SUNSET, SUNRISE 
</P>
<P>
 Teams change over a season. The way it is in November or February probably 
won't be the way it will be in April. 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, let's look at the powers: 
</P>
<P>
 Houston Rockets -- They started 22-1. Since, they're 10-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse, they are bickering among themselves. Hakeem Olajuwon is trying to keep 
everyone together, but point guard/clubhouse lawyer Kenny Smith ("The guys look 
to me for leadership") is complaining about Scottie Brooks finishing all the 
games. Forward Robert Horry, whose unselfishness was considered a key to their 
chemistry, said he wanted to play more, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Rudy Tomjanovich, asked about the possibility he would coach the West in 
the All-Star game, answered: "Who needs that? I'm having trouble keeping nine 
guys in a rotation happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Tomjanovich was having so much trouble he traded Horry, a bulwark in his 
prized defense, to Detroit for Sean Elliott, a softy. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle SuperSonics -- They started 26-3. Since, they're 8-7. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knows the problem we have," Coach George Karl said through clenched 
teeth after an upset in New Jersey last week. "It's attitude. I just don't 
understand how you can feel the way you feel after a game like this. I would 
rather die than . . . feel like this." 
</P>
<P>
 The SuperSonics have a roster full of volatiles, including Gary Payton, 
pouting about not making the All-Star team, scoring 17 points in the first half 
against the Nets, looking at press row and yelling, "Tell that to the damn West 
Coast coaches!" 
</P>
<P>
 Said captain Nate McMillan: "Right now our minds are somewhere else. This is a 
team sport. There's too many guys who think they're All-Stars or should be 
All-Stars or consider themselves superstars. That's BS." 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix Suns -- They started 24-6. Since, they're 5-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Their problem isn't chemistry but injuries to Charles Barkley, Kevin Johnson 
and Danny Ainge. On the other hand, Cedric Ceballos and Oliver Miller have 
stepped up. Given good health, the Suns will be back. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Knicks -- The good news is their 24-3 record against the small fry. 
The bad news is their 8-9 record against teams better than .500. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago Bulls -- They were 5-7 when Scottie Pippen rejoined the team, 27-5 
since. 
</P>
<P>
 Go figure. Phil Jackson, who didn't get one coach-of-the-year vote while 
taking the Bulls to a third consecutive title, was named coach of the month 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta Hawks -- They started 1-4. Since, they're 31-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Go figure II. Everyone's waiting for them to fade, but they haven't. Mookie 
Blaylock, now considered by some the East's best point guard, and Stacey Augmon 
lead a tenacious defense. Lenny Wilkens is a shoo-in for coach of the year. 
HE'S GONZO, TALES OF YOUNG ALONZO 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte's ferocious Alonzo Mourning, like Will Rogers, has the same feeling 
about everyone he meets. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Rogers, it's not a warm feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 In New Jersey, Mourning snarled at Net Coach Chuck Daly, who was checking his 
wrist watch to protest Mourning's deliberate free-throw style. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Allan Bristow, Mourning's coach and constant defender: "Talk about 
something dragging out a game, look at them running their half-court offense." 
</P>
<P>
 Mourning, who once growled, "I'll see you again" to referee Jack Madden, is 
constantly warned by officials about physical play. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like Zo's always getting tugged on or roughed up," says Bristow. 
"But Zo's the one who's always being talked to by the refs." 
</P>
<P>
 Every time Bristow complains to the league office, he is reminded Mourning is 
No. 2 in the league in free-throw attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's that Nike ad Mourning did, using an off-day to fly to Phoenix, 
flying back to Charlotte on the red-eye that night to make practice the next 
day, drawing a request from Bristow not to do it again. 
</P>
<P>
 With a world of athletes to select from, why is the sneaker company promoting 
this prickly pear? Mourning even managed to tick off Nike's hirelings who were 
shooting the commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Stacey Wall, a Portland ad agency exec: "Alonzo Mourning got out of his 
limo and said, 'No dribbling, no rebounds, two dunks. That's all I'm doing.' " 
DERRICK VS. THE NETS 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations continue, after a fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 After a week of talks, New Jersey General Manager Willis Reed and Coleman's 
agent, Harold MacDonald, arrived at a figure -- $75 million for eight seasons, 
with a ninth at club option for $15 million. 
</P>
<P>
 MacDonald said the Nets had made them an offer. Reed said he had to show it to 
the Secaucus Seven owners, who rarely agree on anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it was the reception he got, but Reed didn't come back sounding too 
enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at all factors including Derrick's personality," Reed said. "He 
laughs with his teammates, but on the other side, he yells at those guys, too. 
That's something I don't like. With the kind of money we're talking about 
giving Derrick, he should be one of the main reasons we should win. He should 
be our leader." 
</P>
<P>
 Replied MacDonald: "If they don't sign him, people are going to say it's 
symptomatic of the same old sorry Nets. They can say he's a problem child, a 
head case, this and that. They can make all kinds of excuses. They can put 
whatever spin they want to on it, but if they pay him, they can step up to the 
highest level." 
</P>
<P>
 What can you say? They're both right, except for that bit about the highest 
level, still unrealized despite three years of Coleman. FACES AND FIGURES 
</P>
<P>
 I don't understand it, honey, they're still following us: Scottie Pippen, who 
said he needed a gun to protect himself, was arrested while driving a car with 
a vanity plate that read: "DA PIP." Pippen has plates on other cars that read, 
"MR. PIP" and "BULLS 33." . . . Old Laker Byron Scott on the young Lakers: "I 
hear young guys talking about how the coach should be gone or the offense is 
terrible, this and that. You can't win when you've got that going on. I just go 
by what I read in the newspaper, and what I read is a lot of disarray." 
</P>
<P>
 The source: Pacer General Manager Donnie Walsh is vowing not to tell Coach 
Larry Brown about any more trade talks because Larry blabs it to the nearest 
writer. Latest package to get out: Antonio Davis, Malik Sealy and Sam Mitchell 
to Sacramento for Lionel Simmons and Randy Brown. . . . The comeback: The 
Bullets are dismayed at the lack of progress of (Never in Service) Pervis 
Ellison, still plagued by sore knees. "Obviously, he's not close to being what 
Pervis Ellison was at his best," General Manager John Nash said. "That's the 
single greatest disappointment of this season." . . . The fox: Dallas Maverick 
Coach Quinn Buckner continues to pack the front office with enemies of General 
Manager Norm Sonju and personnel director Rick Sund. The latest is former coach 
Dick Motta, hired as a consultant shortly after publicly ripping Sonju and Sund 
for putting "self-preservation" before the team. . . . Our Hardest Working Man 
in Showtime Award goes to Laker assistant publicist Raymond Ridder, one of the 
few who wasn't awakened by the recent earthquake. At 4:31 a.m. on Jan. 17, 
Ridder was in the office, working on game notes.

SKATER'S FATHER IS STABBED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ice dancer Elizabeth Punsalan has not withdrawn from the Winter Olympics 
despite the stabbing death of her father at his Sheffield Lake, Ohio, home, 
U.S. Olympic Committee officials said Saturday. The skater's brother has been 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 Punsalan had originally planned to arrive here next Thursday with Jerod 
Swallow, her partner and husband, and although USOC officials would not confirm 
that date, they said they've been informed that she does not intend to change 
her travel schedule. Her competition begins on Feb. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Punsalan, 23, and Swallow, 27, were driving from their home in Northville, 
Mich., to Ohio and could not be reached for comment. But the U.S. Figure 
Skating Assn. released a statement from Punsalan that said: "My father was 
proud of my skating achievements and would have wanted me to go on to 
Lillehammer. I will try to skate my very best there in his memory." 
</P>
<P>
 According to a source close to the investigation, police found Dr. Ernesto 
Punsalan, 54, stabbed twice in the chest with a kitchen knife in his bedroom 
Friday night. They were responding to a call at 8:48 p.m. by his wife, Theresa. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Punsalan, a surgeon, was dead on arrival at St. Joseph Hospital in Lorain, 
Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said his son, Rickey Punsalan, 20, will be arraigned Monday in Lorain 
Municipal Court on a charge of aggravated murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a continuing problem in the family," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheffield Lake is a small city in northeastern Ohio, 20 miles west of 
Cleveland. Dr. Punsalan and his wife were planning to travel to Hamar, Norway, 
site of the figure skating competition, to see their daughter and son-in-law 
skate. There was a large sign on the Punsalan's front lawn congratulating the 
skaters for earning Olympic berths with their Jan. 7 victory in the National 
Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon learning about the death Saturday morning shortly before a hearing 
resumed in Colorado Springs, Colo., on the Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan case, 
USFSA spokeswoman Kristin Matta said she was "deeply saddened."

BOB TOLEDO TO COORDINATE UCLA OFFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With Bob Toledo as offensive coordinator, Texas A&M set the Southwest 
Conference rushing record with 3,629 yards two seasons ago and a school scoring 
record with 404 points in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 With Toledo as offensive coordinator, Oregon quarterback Bill Musgrave 
finished second in the Pacific 10 Conference in touchdown passes, with 60 for 
his career, and Chris Miller twice passed for more than 2,200 yards in a 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 So is Toledo a rushing or passing coach? 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to throw the ball," said Toledo, who Saturday was named offensive 
coordinator at UCLA, replacing Homer Smith, who resigned Jan. 15 to take the 
same job at Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still going to be balanced," UCLA Coach Terry Donahue said. "We're not 
going to change the sets, the structure or nomenclature of the offense. Bob 
knows that. Every coach comes in with a new idea, but I'm committed to doing 
what we've done successfully since 1980." 
</P>
<P>
 No problem, said Toledo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's easier for one coach to learn a system than for all the 
players," he said. "Actually, they're doing the same things I've always done. 
They just call them something different." 
</P>
<P>
 Toledo, 47, was a quarterback at San Francisco State and has longstanding 
Southern California ties. He was head coach at UC Riverside from 1973-75 and an 
assistant at USC from 1975-78 before becoming head coach at Pacific. He was 
offensive coordinator at Oregon from 1983-88 before going to Texas A&M in the 
same position. 
</P>
<P>
 He was fired at Texas A&M two days after a 23-20 Cotton Bowl loss to Notre 
Dame. Toledo reportedly was made a scapegoat for the Aggies' third consecutive 
Cotton Bowl loss, and Donahue said Aggie Coach R.C. Slocum had recommended 
Toledo for the Bruin job. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second move of the weekend for the Bruins, who on Friday lost 
offensive line coach Bob Palcic to the Atlanta Falcons, where he joins the 
staff of new Coach June Jones.

BILL MURRAY TELLS DEANE BEMAN TO GET OUT OF THE CADDYSHACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Murray is teed off at Deane Beman and vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 The comic actor, fuming over criticism of his on-course antics at the AT&T 
Pebble Beach National Pro-Am, took aim at the PGA Tour commissioner with 
criticism of his own. 
</P>
<P>
 He began an interview Friday with New York's WCBS-TV by "asking for the 
resignation of Deane Beman." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he lashed out at the tour commissioner, saying Beman was pursuing the 
decorum of golf to ridiculous heights. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a Nazi state out here," Murray complained. "He's trying to ban us from 
the tournament because it's too much fun. He's out of touch. He's just another 
screwhead too big for his britches." 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, who draws one of the biggest galleries at the tournament, has had 
several run-ins with golf officials. 
</P>
<P>
 He irritated Beman at last year's tournament when he pulled an elderly woman 
out of the grandstand on the 18th hole at Pebble Beach and dragged her into a 
bunker. Earlier this week, Beman called that behavior "inappropriate and 
detrimental." 
</P>
<P>
 Murray's pro playing partner, Scott Simpson, said everyone should just lighten 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't the U.S. Open," Simpson said. "In two years, (Murray) never swore, 
never told a dirty joke. And that's more than some pros out here can say."

SIX PLAYERS AND THE COACH ARE SICK, SO WASHINGTON STATE WOMEN CANCEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Washington State canceled its women's basketball game against Arizona State on 
Saturday night because of illness to six players and Coach Harold Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific 10 Conference will decide this week if the Sun Devils (2-14, 0-8) 
will be given a victory by forfeit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars (7-10, 2-6) lost, 82-71, to Arizona at Tucson on Thursday night 
and contemplated returning to Pullman, Wash., because the six players still had 
a viral infection. The team traveled to Tempe and hoped rest Friday would help 
the players and Rhodes recover.

ON-TIME DEPARTURE; TRAKH NO LONGER QUESTIONS MOVE FROM BREA-OLINDA TO 
PEPPERDINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The differences between coaching high school and college basketball players? 
There aren't many says Mark Trakh, in his first season as the Pepperdine 
women's coach after 13 outrageously successful seasons at Brea-Olinda High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 "They may be 19, 20 or 21, but they're still kids," Trakh says. "They still 
need positive strokes, motivation, open lines of communication." 
</P>
<P>
 What about recruiting? Is that the toughest thing about college coaching? Nah. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people say I did a pretty good job of that at Brea," Trakh jokes. "We 
put 13 kids on Division I scholarships at Brea, I sat in on 50 to 60 home 
visits, and I made some campus visits with kids. It gave me an idea of how 
coaches did it, what worked and didn't work." 
</P>
<P>
 Trakh has made a fairly smooth transition from high school to college. His 
Waves are 8-11 entering Tuesday night's nonconference game at Cal State 
Fullerton, they're competitive -- only three losses have been by 10 points or 
more -- and Trakh has received an unwritten commitment from one of the state's 
top community college recruits as he begins to put his signature on the 
Pepperdine program. 
</P>
<P>
 But one aspect of this new job has been very unsettling for Trakh, one he's 
not sure he'll ever grow comfortable with: 
</P>
<P>
 Road trips. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hates to fly," said Pepperdine senior Aimee McDaniel, a former Brea-Olinda 
standout who was reunited with Trakh this season. "When the plane starts to 
take off, you can see the blood rush from his face." 
</P>
<P>
 Trakh, whose team has played in Lincoln, Neb., Portland and Spokane, Wash., 
has always feared flying. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have no control of the plane, you're 30,000 feet up, going 500 m.p.h. . . 
. " Trakh says. "Maybe it's me, but I think that's a pretty natural fear." 
</P>
<P>
 Major anxiety also gripped Trakh last summer when his coaching career was 
about to take off. 
</P>
<P>
 Trakh, who had a 356-42 career record, including 120-1 in the Orange League, 
and won four State championships at Brea, accepted the Pepperdine position June 
16. But after meeting with his players and assistant coaches on June 18, Trakh 
had a change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
 He called Pepperdine Athletic Director Wayne Wright late that night and 
declined the offer, only hours after the Malibu school had made the official 
announcement that Trakh was replacing Ron Fortner. 
</P>
<P>
 After several meetings with players, ex-players, coaches and community members 
over the next week, Trakh came to the conclusion that if he turned this job 
down, he might never get another opportunity to coach in college. 
</P>
<P>
 He called Wright to see if the job was still available. It was, and Wright 
took Trakh back. On June 30, Trakh became the Pepperdine coach. Again. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of anxious moments that week," said Trakh, who had applied 
for previous openings at Cal State Fullerton, UC Irvine, UC Santa Barbara and 
Hawaii and turned down the Chapman job in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went with my heart the first time I turned it down. When you're at a place 
for 13 years, when you watch kids grow up from elementary school until they're 
seniors in high school, you become emotionally tied to a place." 
</P>
<P>
 The clincher in the decision to decline the job might have come during a 
discussion with then-assistant John Hattrup and long-time friends Bill Lantini 
and John Joslin, who run the Brea junior girls' basketball programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were sitting around the office, talking about all the great players who 
were coming up and all the championships we could win," Trakh said. "And then 
Hattrup says, 'Yeah, you can see the ocean from Pepperdine, but on a good day 
you can see it from Brea, too.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Problem was, there were simply too many good days at Brea; coaching had become 
a breeze. Trakh had done such a good job building the dynasty and developing 
the feeder system, and his teams were so successful that his job was no longer 
a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ladycats were so dominant -- 50-point victories were routine, and Brea won 
31 or more games in each of Trakh's last five seasons -- that Trakh could 
usually cruise on automatic pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 And this is what led him back to Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have been a big mistake to not take this job," Trakh said. "Things 
got so easy at Brea that I got complacent. The youth coaches handled the kids, 
the players all wanted to play and excel. I really didn't have to do much." 
</P>
<P>
 The thing Trakh did the least of at Brea is what he wanted to do most -- 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "The past few years, I was really only coaching three or four games a season," 
Trakh, 35, said. "The rest of the time, especially in the Orange League, since 
our athletes were so much more skilled, all you're doing is substituting. 
That's the extent of your coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that makes you complacent, and you don't work as hard. I'm like, 'How 
hard can you prepare for some of these teams?' But that was more a reflection 
on the kids than everyone else. We won because we had better players, not 
coaching. It's not like that at this level." 
</P>
<P>
 Now when Trakh walks into a gym, he has the new sensation of being on the same 
level as his opponents.  
</P>
<P>
 "You've got not only the potential to lose every game, but the potential to be 
blown out every game," Trakh said. "It's funny, you can have a real good game 
against someone good, then lose to a team you should beat. Anything can happen 
at this level. In the Orange League, there was no way in the world, barring 
natural catastrophe, anyone could beat us." 
</P>
<P>
 Trakh has already lost as many games this season as he lost in the previous 
six at Brea, but he seems to be handling it well. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fear of losing is a good thing, it's a good motivator," Trakh said. "I 
have no idea whether I'm a good coach, but I think the next three or four years 
will tell. I definitely have a lot to learn. I look at some of the great 
college coaches I've seen and thought, 'Wow, they really know what they're 
doing.' I want to get to that point." 
</P>
<P>
 He'd also like Pepperdine to ascend to new heights. The Waves have hovered 
around the .500 mark for the past 10 years, they've never won a West Coast 
Conference championship, and they've never earned an NCAA tournament berth. 
McDaniel thinks the new coach will get Pepperdine on the runway toward success. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's already brought a lot of things we were lacking, like team spirit, and 
he knows how to get people motivated," McDaniel said. "The players are learning 
more about each other, plus, we respect him, and he respects us. I think in a 
couple of years he'll have a Brea-type of program established here." 
</P>
<P>

THE HIGH SCHOOLS / JEFF FLETCHER: BEYOND CLICHE AT ALEMANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To say the Alemany High boys' basketball season has been filled with obstacles 
is like saying Charles Manson has a slight public relations problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The season, which was bad to begin with, crumbled, so to speak, at 4:31 a.m. 
Jan. 17, when the Northridge earthquake damaged the school so severely that 
nine of the 12 campus buildings will have to be leveled. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Indians, out of school for two weeks, became nomads, practicing 
wherever they could find a gym or an outdoor court without too many cracks in 
it. Some of the players' homes were damaged enough that they had to find 
temporary lodging. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that they are back in school, the students are attending classes in split 
sessions at Our Lady Queen of Angels Seminary across the street. Portable 
classrooms will be brought in soon and assembled in a nearby orange grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, life's rough, but the earthquake isn't the half of it. Throw all the 
happy cliches out the window with this team. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for the silver lining.  
</P>
<P>
 A few days after the earthquake, Phillip Aldrete's home in Sylmar was looted. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'Coach, it looked like they just pulled up a truck and scooped out 
all they could,' " Alemany Coach Robert Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
 The only way to go is up.  
</P>
<P>
 Last Tuesday, Brandon Patin was driving teammate Tim Kubasak to his home in 
the Santa Clarita Valley after a morning practice at Notre Dame. The roads were 
slick, and Patin slammed into a guard rail where Interstate 5 meets Highway 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Kubasak suffered a slight shoulder separation, Webb said. Otherwise, just 
bumps and bruises for the two. The car, which belonged to Patin's mother, will 
require about $4,000 worth of repairs, Patin said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's darkest just before dawn.  
</P>
<P>
 Last Wednesday, with the lots at Alemany closed for safety reasons, assistant 
Mike Huggins parked his car in the Holy Cross Hospital lot before practice. 
</P>
<P>
 When he returned to his car, he found the windows broken and the radio stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 Huggins had planned to go from practice to meet with his fiancee and the 
pastor who would be marrying them, but his change of clothes was also stolen. 
He had to go in his Alemany sweat suit. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were all understanding," Huggins said. "It's one of those things you 
don't expect to happen after an earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 Things can only get better.  
</P>
<P>
 Last Saturday, when the Indians met at Alemany for a trip to Torrance and a 
game against Bishop Montgomery, the van that was supposed to transport them 
wasn't there. The team waited and waited, finally making it to Bishop 
Montgomery as the final buzzer from the junior varsity game was sounding. 
</P>
<P>
 With only 15 minutes of preparation, Alemany went out and lost by eight 
points. A moral victory, considering the Indians lost by 35 the first time the 
teams met. 
</P>
<P>
 When the going gets tough, the tough get going.  
</P>
<P>
 All of it is Webb's introduction to being a head coach. At 25 -- "I feel like 
I'm about 95" -- Webb is in his first year of running a program. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the years get tougher than this, I'm not going to be doing this long," he 
said. "I'll be on a farm somewhere picking vegetables. Or fishing a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides dealing with the off-court problems, he's trying to coax victories out 
of a basketball team that lacks height and experience. The Indians are 3-17, 
0-11 in the Mission League.  
</P>
<P>
 Webb says the team is improving despite the setbacks. After all, the first 
time through the schedule the Indians lost to Bishop Montgomery and St. Bernard 
by a combined 65 points. In post-earthquake games, they lost by only 15 to 
those opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Break out the champagne. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teams are going to be glad they don't have to play us one more time," Webb 
said. "I have to commend my players. The easy thing is to say 'Let's just 
forget this,' but they are battling and playing better than ever. Don't ask me 
to explain it. We shouldn't be playing well, but we are." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He Said It: After Agoura's Benon Ureda swished the winning three-pointer with 
11 seconds remaining in overtime against Simi Valley on Friday, he said he was 
comfortable with the shot. "I was in a rhythm," Ureda said. 
</P>
<P>
 A rhythm, huh? Must have been a mental one. Ureda made only one other basket 
in the game, and it was in the first half. Nice shooting anyway, Benon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Looking Ahead: One of the more interesting playoff matchups we might be seeing 
would be Harvard-Westlake against St. Francis. Both are among the top teams in 
the Southern Section's Division III-A, so they could meet in the semifinals or 
the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard is 19-2, largely because of freshmen Jason and Jarron Collins. At 
6-foot-8 and 6-foot-7, the twins don't find many eyes in the Mission League 
into which they can look directly. The Wolverines have been winning by posting 
up against shorter players and making layup after layup. 
</P>
<P>
 "They won't be able to do that to us," St. Francis Coach John Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden Knights (18-5) feature 6-8 Braden Weber and 6-11 Chris Ott. 
</P>
<P>
 Stay tuned. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Great Outdoors: Because Highland Hall's gym was being used by the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency to implement earthquake relief and West Valley 
Christian's was damaged by the quake, the teams played their Westside League 
makeup game Saturday morning on a full-sized blacktop court at West Valley 
Christian. 
</P>
<P>
 The game had regular officials and spectators and everything. Even an 
electronic scoreboard was rigged up, with the help of an extra-long extension 
cord. 
</P>
<P>
 "You couldn't see the clock because of the glare of the sun, though," Highland 
Hall senior Kamal Van Scoy said. 
</P>
<P>
 One might have expected the wind to create shooting problems, but Van Scoy 
didn't use that excuse for his team's 47-25 loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't the wind," he said. "We were just missing our shots."

SALSA TO PLAY KEY CONCACAF CUP GAME TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Salsa will attempt to stay alive in play in the CONCACAF Cup at 4 p.m. 
today when it plays Alianza of El Salvador at Cal State Fullerton's Titan 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The game is the second of a two-game series, and the Salsa needs more than 
just a victory to advance in the Cup, a tournament for soccer league champions 
and runners-up in North and Central America and the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 Alianza won the first game last Saturday in San Salvador, 1-0. Under the 
scoring system, visitors earn two points for each goal and the home team one. 
</P>
<P>
 Salsa victories of 2-1 or 3-2, for example, would still advance Alianza. The 
Salsa would advance by winning, 2-0 or 4-2. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Salsa is ahead by 1-0 or 3-1 at the end of 90 minutes, leaving the 
teams tied in points, they will go immediately to penalty kicks to decide a 
winner.

DIGEST: SKIERESZ FAILS TO QUALIFY FOR JUNIOR NATIONAL TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amy Skieresz of Agoura High placed eighth in the U.S. World Junior (age 19 and 
under) cross-country trials in Memphis, Tenn., on Saturday, but fell two places 
shy of qualifying for the national team for the second year in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Skieresz, who won last year's trials race before placing 39th in the World 
Junior championships, timed 15 minutes 9 seconds over the 4,000-meter course at 
Plough Park in Shelby Farms. 
</P>
<P>
 Brigham Young freshman Maribella Aparicio, a former Fillmore High runner, 
placed 11th in 15:20. 
</P>
<P>
 Dartmouth freshman Maribel Sanchez placed first in 14:44. 
</P>
<P>
 The top six finishers in both the men's and women's races qualified for the 
U.S. team, which will compete March 26 in the World championships in Budapest. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno State sophomore Fernando Mendoza, a former standout at Channel Islands 
High, placed 21st in the junior men's race with a time of 28:07 over the 
8,000-meter course. Thousand Oaks High senior Brandon Del Campo finished 29th 
in 28:36. Auto Racing  
</P>
<P>
 Lance Hooper, whose racing budget vanished in the wreckage of last month's Los 
Angeles earthquake, set a NASCAR Southwest Tour qualifying record in Phoenix 
while winning the pole for today's 50-lap final. 
</P>
<P>
 Hooper, 26, had to borrow money to bring his Oldsmobile Cutlass to Phoenix 
International Raceway for the $53,500 event, the last of four in the Skoal 
Bandit Racing Copper World Classic. But he paced a 66-car field with a one-mile 
lap of 130.833 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sponsors were wiped out in the earthquake," Hooper said. "It was iffy 
getting here. I borrowed some money from Ron Hornaday Jr. and a couple of other 
guys." Basketball  
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth High senior Trenell Floyd has left the basketball team and is 
seeking an opportunity transfer to Taft, he said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just felt like the season was over for us after the earthquake," said 
Floyd, a center who was averaging 14.6 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Floyd will learn Monday if the transfer has been granted. He said he will not 
play basketball at Taft.

HISTORY IN THE MAKING; BASQUE COMPILES HIS CULTURE'S CONTRIBUTIONS TO SAN JUAN 
CAPISTRANO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRAD BONHALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Visitors to San Juan Capistrano a century ago could be forgiven for thinking 
they had somehow been transported to Mediterranean Europe: Here was the 
identical seaside climate, the same fragrant, hilly landscape. That dust 
spiraling above the center of town was from hundreds of sheep being herded down 
Camino Capistrano, then a dirt road. And tending the sheep, looking as if they 
were straight out of the West Pyrenees, were Basques. 
</P>
<P>
 A people of obscure origin who inhabit the mountainous border region of 
western France and Spain, Basques were prominent among the early settlers of 
San Juan Capistrano, having been lured by opportunities to invest their money 
and ancient skills in ranching and farming. Today, their descendants are among 
the oldest residents of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 San Juan, as Orange County cities go, has a rich history, and at least one 
local Basque, Jean Lacouague, fears that his culture's contributions have been 
lost in the shuffle of historical attention that tends to revolve around the 
Mission, the Aghachamem Indians and white land barons. 
</P>
<P>
 Since October, Lacouague, 70, has been compiling narrative histories of a 
dozen or so Basque families who lived and worked in San Juan and the immediate 
area. He plans to donate the completed project to the San Juan Capistrano 
Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Basques were a significant bunch of landowners and provided work and 
contributions to the economy," said Lacouague, on a break from an equipment 
repair project on his five-acre farm near San Juan Creek.  
</P>
<P>
 "I got to thinking, hell, the Forsters have their history plastered all over 
town; the Indians have their history recorded, but there's nothing written 
about the Basques. Nobody knows a damn thing about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the Basque immigrants, Lacouague says, were sent for in Europe by 
successful Basques already living here. Lacouague's father, Pierre, immigrated 
to San Juan from Ainhoa, France, in 1910, to work as a farmhand. Others came by 
way of Latin America, Nevada or California's Central Valley. Many learned 
English while working as shepherds, citrus farmers and hotel maids. 
</P>
<P>
 Basque ranchers and farmers at one time were the largest seasonal employers in 
San Juan Capistrano, according to historian Pamela Hallan-Gibson. After the 
Civil War, the sheep industry boomed because of a shortage of wool, and the 
Orange County climate proved perfect for raising sheep. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most prominent Basques were the Oyharzabal family," Hallan-Gibson said. 
"They came early, in 1878, were big property owners, and (their descendants) 
still live in downtown San Juan." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1890s, Domingo Oyharzabal, from the Basses-Pyrenees, France, owned 
4,000 acres and, along with fellow Basques Cornelio Echenique and Jean 
Daguerre, employed Basque sheepherders on property that is now Leisure World 
Laguna Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "The major sheep area was where Marco F. Forster Junior High is now," 
Hallan-Gibson said. "The business was so big the local guys couldn't handle it, 
and Basques from the Temecula and Pala area would come in on a seasonal basis. 
They would run the sheep right through San Juan Capistrano, down Del Obispo . . 
. to the sheep shearing grounds beyond Del Avion." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1880, Oyharzabal began to accumulate real estate with another Basque, Juan 
Salaberri, in and around downtown San Juan Capistrano. They bought the 
1840s-era Miguel Garcia and Domingo Yorba adobes, which still stand side by 
side on Camino Capistrano and are on the National Register of Historic Places. 
The two-story Garcia adobe served as the French Hotel until 1903 and as a 
general store until 1918, according to Oyharzabal family documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Eugenie Oyharzabal, the widow of Domingo's nephew Esteban, has lived in the 
Yorba adobe since arriving as a bride from St. Jean Le Vieux, Spain, in 1924. 
Eugenie, 103, spends much of her days knitting and reading her French-language 
prayer book, according to her daughter Carmen, 67. The Oyharzabals, who speak 
Basque, Spanish, French or English to each other, still own the adobes and 
collect rent from the merchants in the Garcia adobe. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Carmen appreciates the controlled-growth development policies of the 
city, she fondly recalls the days before the early 1970s when there were just 
1,400 families in San Juan Capistrano. "We knew practically everybody then, and 
now there are 25,000 people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always lived in this house," she said. "When I was growing up, we used 
to sit on the porch and watch the traffic on Camino Capistrano, which was the 
main route then" between Los Angeles and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Changes in the Basque community have been subtle but absolute. There is, of 
course, far less ranching and farming, and fewer young people are learning to 
speak the Basque language. For decades, Carmen Oyharzabal and her friends 
played a Basque card game called mus every Saturday night. But the longstanding 
games stopped three years ago because her mother no longer cared to be the 
fourth player, Carmen says, and the younger-generation Basques showed no 
interest in learning the game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The Oyharzabals were the biggest single employer in San Juan at one time," 
said Lacouague, who is using the Oyharzabals' old payroll lists of ranch, hotel 
and store employees to pin down names and dates for his history project. "They 
ran a boarding house, had a water district and supplied water to the town 
initially, (then) hooked up different houses." 
</P>
<P>
 With his wife, Marie, who is also Basque, and two of his children, Lacouague 
lives on the same property where he was born. Letter carriers have little 
excuse for misdirected mail: The Lacouagues live on Camino Lacouague. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lacouague Ranch is believed by some historians to be the site of both an 
Aghachamem village and the Franciscan mission before it was moved to its 
permanent site downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 The property is part of an orange and walnut farm bought by Pierre Lacouague 
from his employer, Cornelio Echenique, who along with Frank and John Forster 
was one of the largest landowners in the early 1900s. The Echenique home was on 
land that is now Four Oaks Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Oyharzabals, the Lacouagues have left an imprint on the city they've 
called home for most of the 20th Century. A senior citizens' recreation 
building in San Juan Capistrano is named for Jean Lacouague, and he served as 
chief of the city's volunteer fire department until 1982, when his son, Dan, 
took over the job for 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Lacouague's project will be a "wonderful and significant addition" to the 
San Juan Capistrano Historical Society museum, said director Gwen Vermeulen, 
adding that the society's board of directors will decide how to publish and 
present the work. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacouague, who has not set a completion date for his project, has been 
enlisting the help of friends and acquaintances for his family narratives. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm 70 years old and know a lot firsthand, and there are still a few people 
my age who are helping me," he says. "But I'm also talking to grandchildren of 
Basques, finding out the dates their people came here, the towns they came 
from, who they worked for. I want to get everything accurate."

PERSONAL HEALTH; CURING DOCTORS OF FIGHTING ON JOB

 Did you hear the one about the surgeon and the anesthesiologist who got into a 
fistfight in the surgical suite while the patient awaited her gallbladder 
operation? 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, this is not a joke. 
</P>
<P>
 The bizarre spectacle made news recently when the two doctors reached an 
agreement with the Massachusetts State Board of Registration in Medicine, which 
fined them $10,000 each and put them on probation for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Peculiar as the case may seem, heated quarrels between doctors on the job are 
not unusual. And although most doctors stop short of duking it out, conflicts 
among health-care professionals are sometimes serious enough to interfere with 
patient care. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Gitlin, chief of the Massachusetts medical board that investigated the 
case, said the clash was classic, in that it involved a surgeon and an 
anesthesiologist. Individuals in those two specialties are well-known for their 
mutual antagonism, born of the intense pressure of shared responsibility for a 
patient's life and traditionally different personality types. Surgeons are 
typically personified as cowboy go-getters, anesthesiologists as cool, calm, 
fine-tuners. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, conflict-resolution has become a component of medical school 
training.

TESTING THE LIMITS; THANKS TO BOLD NEW TECHNOLOGY, A WOMAN CAN GIVE BIRTH IN 
HER 40S, 50S AND 60S. BUT SHOULD SHE? 
</P>

<P>
 There are careers to juggle, toys to avoid stepping on, earaches to have 
treated and play dates to arrange. The diapers mount up, and so do the bills 
from the baby-sitter and the pediatrician. Most days, Lynn Grossman-Getoff and 
her husband, Peter Getoff, are so busy caring for 15-month-old Emily that they 
give little thought to the fact that they arrived at parenthood at an age -- 
and via a route -- that trouble some people. 
</P>
<P>
 But sometimes, reality hits home. "You are dealing with so many stages of life 
at one time that it's disorienting, to say the least," Grossman-Getoff said. 
"You're dealing with all the issues of a young mother -- and, at the same time, 
menopause." 
</P>
<P>
 Using eggs donated by a younger woman, Grossman-Getoff, a West Los Angeles 
family therapist, gave birth when she was almost 45 -- six years older than her 
husband, a social worker. She is well aware that her age by no means thrusts 
her into the book-of-records category for first-time mothers, a distinction 
held by a 61-year-old Italian. Still, by using ovum transfer and high 
technology to conceive when her own body was at a stage called perimenopausal, 
Grossman-Getoff entered an arena where science is dueling with physiology -- 
and where, at the moment, no one is quite sure who is winning. 
</P>
<P>
 Donor eggs and bold new procedures that prepare an aging uterus for pregnancy 
are enabling women to test the biological limits of maternity. Doctors in this 
field stress that such procedures are still new and are by no means widespread, 
with only 50 to 75 babies born to post-menopausal women around the world in the 
last three years. But, they concede, sacred societal notions about motherhood 
are suddenly on the line. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue came to prominence not long ago when a 59-year-old British woman 
went public with the fact that she had just given birth to healthy full-term 
twins. Her announcement added fuel to the debate about high-tech reproduction: 
If men can embark on parenthood at any age, shouldn't women have the same 
option? Is a post-menopausal woman physically capable of raising an infant? 
Will she live to see her child grow up? Does a child get a fair shake in a 
household where Parents magazine arrives alongside Modern Maturity? 
</P>
<P>
 To Dr. Mark V. Sauer, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at USC who is 
among the leading specialists in egg-donor pregnancies, such questions reduce 
to a matter of individual choice between a patient and her physician. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we have reproductive choice in this country and we have technology that 
works," Sauer said, "then why deny the choice?" 
</P>
<P>
 But another pioneer in post-menopausal pregnancy, Dr. Ricardo Asch of the 
University of California, Irvine, said that even though his clinic imposes no 
age limit for what are sometimes called third-party pregnancies, some kind of 
guidelines are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the case of using egg donations for someone who underwent normal 
menopause, you're not treating pathology," said Asch, a dean at UC Irvine's 
School of Medicine. "You're just challenging physiology, the normal events that 
happen to a human being. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have mixed feelings about this, I really do," Asch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, parents who have benefited from ART, or assisted 
reproductive technology, are not so ambivalent. 
</P>
<P>
 Working through the technological steps that saw his sperm mixed with a 
donor's eggs, then inserted into his wife's womb, required "a certain stamina," 
Peter Getoff recalled. "There was so much at stake, and there was a sense of 
unreality to it." 
</P>
<P>
 But in a culture where "we mess with Mother Nature in lots of other ways," 
many people still cling to "some very rigid and idealized notions about how 
things should be in terms of motherhood," Getoff said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, I just have very strong feelings that a woman has a right to have a 
child fairly late in life." 
</P>
<P>
 Getoff and his wife are unusual among ovum-donor parents interviewed by The 
Times in that they readily agreed to be quoted by name and were comfortable 
revealing their ages. More typical was the 49-year-old mother in the San 
Francisco area who asked that she be called "Laura" and that her husband, 62, 
be referred to as "Sid." These are made-up names; Laura said she was worried 
about personal security, adding that when she discusses post-menopausal 
reproduction on television, she does not disclose her real name or hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 What is true is that Laura and Sid were married for 30 years before they 
became parents. Married young, they dreamed of a big family, six kids at least. 
But nature failed to cooperate. No specific cause could be isolated for their 
failure to conceive, making treatment a challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple went through seven cycles of in vitro fertilization. They tried a 
procedure in which a fertilized egg is inserted directly into a woman's 
Fallopian tube. Again, no luck. There were other treatments, such as hormone 
injections and intrauterine injection of Sid's sperm into Laura. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing worked. We never even got a nibble," Laura said. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura was well into her 40s by the time she was ready to consider adoption. 
She found the process troubling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Adoption takes so long," she said. "And you have to sell yourself, like a 
product." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Laura and Sid had adopted a baby boy when they received a call 
from their fertility specialist, Dr. Geoffrey Sher. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was December, 1991, and egg donation wasn't being talked about," Laura 
recalled. "But they said they were having a lot of success. So I said sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Three months later, Laura was pregnant after her first attempt at receiving a 
donated egg. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took me three months before I really believed it," Laura said. "I kept 
doing home pregnancy tests, just to make sure." 
</P>
<P>
 That child, a boy, is now a year old, and Laura is trying to become pregnant 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 Sher, whose Pacific Fertility Center has clinics throughout California, cites 
remarkable success rates for pregnancies attained through egg transfers. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half of his clinic's donor-egg recipients are post-menopausal, Sher 
said, noting that menopause normally occurs between 40 and 55. But regardless 
of the age of the recipient, "assuming she has a healthy uterus and the donor 
is under age 35," Sher said, the birth rate per attempted embryo transfer is 
56%. 
</P>
<P>
 Hormone preparations enhance the "friendliness" of an older uterus, Sher said. 
A notable example is a 53-year-old patient of his from Central Europe, who is 
now in her second post-menopausal pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Because egg donation is illegal in her country, that patient would not permit 
her name or the country she resides in to be used in this article. But in a 
telephone interview, she and her husband said they had tried for many years to 
have children by more conventional means. They said they ignored the 
reproachful relatives and friends who chastised that they would be in their 70s 
when their children entered college. 
</P>
<P>
 "Listen, we are very healthy. We don't look the age we are. And you can die 
also at 35," the woman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband, 55, sloughed off concerns that he might not live to see his 
grandchildren: "Ah, but that could happen also if I had a child at 35."  
</P>
<P>
 Age is relative, this couple insisted. In birthing classes to prepare for the 
arrival of their daughter 10 months ago, for example, it was the younger 
parents who were uncomfortable in their presence -- not the other way around, 
they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the relationship with the child is good, age doesn't matter anyhow," the 
woman said. "I remember when I was a very young child, I thought anyone who was 
20 was terribly old. At 40, I thought they were dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Sher has not been confronted with patients in their 60s or 70s who 
are seeking to become pregnant, he believes strongly that physicians cannot 
arbitrarily draw an age line. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not discriminate on the basis of age, marital status or sexual 
preference," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are here to do is to responsibly enhance the human condition, using 
technology to enhance that condition. We're here to help people have families." 
</P>
<P>
 But even some of Sher's own patients falter in the face of time. Laura, for 
one, has decided not to try for any more pregnancies after her 50th birthday. 
Still, she supports other women in her age group who might decide to push 
beyond that limit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people should mind their own business," Laura said. "If people want 
to have a baby in their 50s, they're going to raise that child. No one is 
asking them to do it. Just the fact that you want to have a baby at that age 
tells me you're not an old 50." 
</P>
<P>
 But 50 remains the magic number, the age when an unseen buzzer goes off and 
people get edgy about pregnancy. In many circles, a 49-year-old pregnant woman 
is a source of amazement, a miracle of human fecundity, while a 50-year-old in 
maternity clothes is more likely to be viewed as a grotesque curiosity. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a psychological barrier at 50," agreed Carole Lieber-Wilkins, a West 
Los Angeles psychotherapist who counsels couples undergoing fertility 
treatment. "But that used to be 40. Now it's really common for 40-year-olds to 
be having their first children." 
</P>
<P>
 Anne Adams, a New York journalist who until recently published a newsletter 
geared to older parents, predicted that as egg donation becomes more common, 50 
will seem less significant. 
</P>
<P>
 "As science and people's desires to procreate collide to push the age 
frontiers out, it seems to push what we regard as old parents further out on 
the timeline," Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not saying people will ever stop scratching their heads at a 58-year-old 
woman who wants to experience pregnancy, and I still don't think most people 
are going to opt to get pregnant at 60," she said. "But I think the shock value 
will wear off." 
</P>
<P>
 But Sher maintains that questioning the motives of a 50-year-old woman who 
wants to have a child is a reflection of outdated values. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just so happens that women lose their fertility over the age of 40 for 
reasons that applied when the life span was 50, not 70," Sher said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 55-year cutoff age that he has imposed at his Los Angeles clinic is 
arbitrary, USC's Sauer said. "It's simply that my comfort level gets stretched 
beyond that, because I do have a problem with longevity issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Sauer said 18 of the 29 women older than 50 whom he has worked with since 1990 
have become pregnant. One 51-year-old had triplets, Sauer said; a 55-year-old 
patient gave birth to twins. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the novelty element of this kind of parenthood is clear even to Sauer: 
"Every time we take on a 50-year-old, to me I still think of it as 
experimental." 
</P>
<P>
 In the view of UC Irvine's Asch, the uncharted nature of this technological 
territory is cause for concern. Asch has performed embryo transfers on women 
older than 50. He has also used the procedure to aid much younger women who 
wished to become pregnant but experienced premature ovarian failure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Technology so far is dictating" reproductive age limits, Asch said. "That is 
where we need to examine where we are going with all this." 
</P>
<P>
 Scientific progress is one thing, Asch said. "But from there to say that there 
should be no limits at all to reproductive freedom is a mistake. I think we 
need guidelines. We need to agree to limits, as a society, and among the 
medical community." 
</P>
<P>
 But for those contemplating such procedures, the limits may be more pragmatic. 
High-tech pregnancies are expensive and generally little if any of these costs 
are covered by insurance. Lynn Grossman-Getoff estimated the cost of conceiving 
Emily at about $12,000 -- high enough that she is not sure she can afford 
another such pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial constraints have been a major concern for another of Sauer's 
patients, who asked that her identity be disguised. "Fran Jones," as this 
44-year-old, unmarried attorney from Sacramento asked to be called, said her 
earlier attempts at pregnancy -- using her own eggs and donor-inseminated sperm 
-- cost her about $3,500 per attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Since her projected success rate using that method was only about 5% to 10%, 
Jones said she turned to a younger sister for an ovum donation. 
</P>
<P>
 "You continue to read these stories about these 59-year-old ladies who've had 
twins, and you figure why not give it a shot," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, she added, "I guess I've always wanted to be pregnant. I've always 
wanted to have my own baby. I would have preferred to do it the more 
traditional way, but it didn't happen to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Relationship after relationship failed to work out, Jones said. Before she 
knew it, she was 41 and worried that her childbearing years were winding down. 
</P>
<P>
 That description squares with stories psychotherapist Lieber-Wilkins said she 
has heard time and again in her counseling work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the myth that really gets me is this idea that women have just kind 
of postponed pregnancy because of their careers," Lieber-Wilkins said. "The 
truth is, most of the women in my practice have been going through infertility 
treatment for years." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of these women have similar profiles as Jones -- women who had never met 
"the right man" or a man willing to have children at the same time they were. 
So women of 40 and older who seek out high-tech reproductive options are 
probably not doing it as a lark, Lieber-Wilkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The very nature of high-tech reproduction doesn't allow for frivolity," she 
said. "It's expensive, it's time-consuming, it's grueling on your body -- and 
it's hard on a relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Should the process succeed, the struggle to become pregnant may pale in the 
face of raising a child in a world that is not accustomed to vintage parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're walking in the dark," said Christi Taylor-Jones, the author of 
"Midlife Parenting" (Veracity Press). "There are no role models." 
</P>
<P>
 Older parents may seek to dismiss the age issue, Taylor-Jones said, "but the 
reality is that they may not be alive when their kids have kids. They may be 
old and healthy -- but they may also be ill and elderly, and their kids are 
going to have to take care of them, just at the point when they're getting 
their own lives launched." 
</P>
<P>
 As the editor of a short-lived magazine called "Over-30 Parenting," 
Taylor-Jones, of Los Angeles, said she talked to many older mothers who 
reported intense feelings of isolation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were a kind of island. Their friends their own age either had grown 
kids, teen-agers or no kids," she said. And while "20-year-old mothers often 
defer to their own parents" for information, most older mothers and fathers 
felt uneasy soliciting guidance from their elderly parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor-Jones also found that older parents often came face to face with 
complicated expectations that did not mesh with the reality of raising children 
at any age. 
</P>
<P>
 "They think because they are older that they really ought to be able to do 
this thing called parenting," she said. "But parenting is sort of like an 
earthquake. No one is prepared for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquakes are touchy subjects in Southern California these days. But at 
Sauer's office, near USC, temblors have earned a spot in the folklore of 
high-tech medicine. One of Sauer's patients, Jones, the 44-year-old attorney, 
recalled that her first attempt at embryo transfer took place the morning of 
Jan. 17, only hours after the 6.6 Richter-scale quake that jolted Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 As she left the hospital following the procedure, Jones said, Sauer gave her 
an affable smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this one works," Sauer told her, "we'll have to remember to shake all our 
eggs up in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe a sense of humor goes with the turf in the sphere of assisted 
reproduction. In Central Europe, the 55-year-old first-time father has vowed 
that the first compound phrase he will teach his daughter is: "That is not my 
grandpapa. That is my papa."

STARTING FROM SCRATCH; FOR VICTIMS OF THE NORTHRIDGE QUAKE AND LAST FALL'S 
FIRES, REBUILDING BEGINS WITH THE CLOTHES ON THEIR BACKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAMELA WARRICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Suppose you woke up one morning to find all your clothes gone. Everything, 
that is, except for some red underwear you bought on a whim one silly day long 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," Megan Edwards said, "that's me. The fires were raging all around us and 
I had just minutes to get out. I grabbed a few things for my husband, but what 
I took for myself was that red underwear. Like I can really rebuild a wardrobe 
based on that ." 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of wildfires and earthquakes, Edwards is just one of hundreds of 
disaster victims struggling to put their lives back together. For some, that 
means coming face to face with the fashion challenge of a lifetime: starting 
over from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 For those without insurance money, the task is "unimaginably difficult, 
impossible really," said a young woman who lost everything when her rented 
mobile home was destroyed two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with insurance, the task is formidable. "A wardrobe is something you 
accumulate over time, it's a collection," said fashion writer Mimi Avins, who 
lost her home to the Malibu fires. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid the answer to how you replace a wardrobe is you don't. You just 
don't," Avins said with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
 But you can create a new one. And maybe, in the process, reinvent not only 
your closet but also the way you present yourself to the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "When something like this happens, you find out that it's true what they say: 
less is more," Los Angeles clotheshorse and author Judie Stein said. "The 
challenge is making the right choices." 
</P>
<P>
 In a Red Cross shelter three days after the Northridge quake, Michelle Adams, 
41, pondered the contents of her life: two oversize acrylic sweaters, a pair of 
sturdy brown shoes, a T-shirt and bicycle shorts -- all folded neatly into a 
cardboard box next to her cot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nothing, really," she said in a flat voice. "It's all I have left and 
it's nothing. But things don't matter to me anymore. How can they? I'm alive. 
I'm just grateful to be alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams, a free-lance writer and photographer, says the floor of her 
fourth-floor Hollywood walk-up was giving way even as she reached into the dark 
for a few possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I wanted my family photos and my journals, my writing. And I pretty 
much knew I wouldn't be back, so I grabbed the clothes."  
</P>
<P>
 Picking at her shelter lunch of chicken, bread and applesauce, she looked 
overdressed in a bright blue silk shirt. "It matches my eyes and it makes me 
feel good. That's why I'm wearing this," she said. "If I get some money coming 
in soon, I'll buy more things like this -- things that make me feel good. No 
matter what." 
</P>
<P>
 Joey Tenorio, 11, whose family also lost everything in the earthquake, is 
counting on Red Cross clothing vouchers to help rebuild his wardrobe. But he 
knows some things cannot be replaced. "My Raiders hat. Man, what a loss! It was 
just right, the way it fit, the way it felt. I won't find that again. No way." 
</P>
<P>
 Joey's mother, however, is not sorry the hat is gone. "I always wondered about 
the way he wore it, the message it sent on the street, you know?" 
</P>
<P>
 While loss is never welcome, some disaster survivors concede that the changes 
it forces may not be all bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "To put the best spin on a tragic situation," said Edwards, a 41-year-old 
Altadena real estate agent, "our great loss has freed us to try new and 
different things. We're taking advantage of our stuffless situation. We're 
buying an RV and traveling around the country. And I'm changing the way I've 
always dressed. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Most of my clothes were from when I was a schoolteacher -- like that denim 
jumper with the big pockets for chalk. I won't miss that. I had so many 
conservative clothes -- the kind that made Lands' End famous. Everything 
matching. Don't-rock-the-boat clothes." 
</P>
<P>
 The new Megan Edwards wears black stirrup pants with big, bright chenille 
tops. She has a new black leather swing coat and a clingy little dress from 
Jones New York. And thanks to a generous sister, she now has a fur -- "one of 
those little stoles with the foxes all biting each other's tail." 
</P>
<P>
 Stein said one of her Malibu neighbors has undergone a complete sartorial 
make-over. "He was kind of a '60s hippie who lived in a tent across the road. 
When his tent burned and all his clothes, everybody started giving him things 
and he's never looked better," she said. "Now he walks around in fancy running 
suits, a Burberry raincoat, Adidas shoes. . . . He looks fabulous!" 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to rebuilding after disaster, Patsy Dickerman has become a 
reluctant expert. In 1975, she lost everything in a fire that consumed her 
brand-new Texas home. Today, she is recovering from the loss of her 2-year-old 
"dream house" in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's underestimated is the emotional impact it has on you. And it's tougher 
when you know what's ahead, like I do," said Dickerman, a sales executive. "I 
could just feel how tired I was going to be for a long period of time.  
</P>
<P>
 "People say, 'Oh aren't you lucky to be able to go on a big shopping spree.' 
But, gosh, that's just the last thing in the world you feel like doing after 
something like this. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Dickerman knows the routine. "First my husband, Jim, and I replaced the 
basics, what we absolutely had to have to carry on. Underwear, of course, and 
shoes and raincoats, then business suits for him and a couple real dressy 
things for me, along with jeans and T-shirts." 
</P>
<P>
 Many survivors said they derive comfort in replacing what they loved most in 
their closets and putting off other purchases until they feel more like 
shopping. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Edwards' husband, Mark Sedenquist, 39, has made a few changes in the 
way he dresses, he spent much of the first emergency insurance check they 
received on a new white wool suit, white buck shoes and a red tie to replace 
the outfit he has worn for years as a Tournament of Roses official. 
</P>
<P>
 The first piece of post-fire clothing purchased by Avins' husband, movie exec 
Wolf Schmidt, was a pair of hiking shorts. "Hiking helped him feel that life 
was going on. We always hiked in the Santa Monica Mountains. The house burned, 
but the mountains didn't," Avins said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My advice to others is to decide what your own personal 'uniform' is," Avins 
said. "Is it jeans and a blazer? Pleated trousers and a silk blouse? A big 
sweater and leggings? Start rebuilding from there."

 For those with the resources to shop retail, there is plenty of free help 
waiting from personal shoppers, such as Tella Archambault at Bullock's in 
Pasadena. "Some things you truly cannot replace, but we're here to help people 
find what they need, to create a new closet of pieces that may or may not 
resemble what was lost." 
</P>
<P>
 Archambault and Billur Wallerich, her counterpart at Neiman Marcus, advise 
shoppers to stick to neutrals at first. "Start by building on blacks, or taupes 
or grays," Archambault said. "Choose classic styles, nothing too trendy. These 
may have to last you a long time. You don't want to grow tired of looking at 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Similar advice was offered at Nordstrom, where disaster victims are served 
Evian and tiny sandwiches while they review their needs with store helpers.  
</P>
<P>
 But for survivors like Diana, 33, who lost her wardrobe and her rented trailer 
in the quake, the question isn't which color scheme to go with, but where to 
find Scout uniforms and school shoes for her young daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been wearing the same two sweat suits for about two weeks now and when I 
get some money, I'll probably buy another one because, well, you could say it 
fits my lifestyle just now," said Diana, who asked that her last name not be 
used. "Call it 'the Shelter Look of the '90s.' "

THIS MARRIAGE CAN BE SAVED IF PAIR IS MOTIVATED, EXPERTS SAY; RELATIONSHIPS: 
MANY TROUBLED UNIONS CAN BE FIXED IF COUPLES REMEMBER A FEW THINGS, THERAPISTS 
SAY: COMMUNICATE, AND AGREE HOW TO HANDLE CONFLICTS.

<P>
 Their problems seem overwhelming; the marriage, hopeless. Still, they wish 
they could make it work. 
</P>
<P>
 It's really quite striking, given how miserable they've been, how easily the 
problems of many such couples can be solved. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the hopeful message from psychology professors and marital therapists 
Clifford Notarius and Howard Markman, who have made careers of studying what it 
is that makes marriages work. 
</P>
<P>
 Notarius, of the Catholic University of America, and Markman, of the 
University of Denver, are authors of "We Can Work It Out: Making Sense of 
Marital Conflict" (Putnam, $21.95). 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you figure out what's gone wrong, it's not too difficult, if you're 
motivated, to fix it," Markman says. "We try to provide a road map on how to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The book is an effort "to convey to people why marriages work, why they don't 
work -- really give people an understanding of the research. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of nice," he says, "because what the science is showing" is not 
that marriages fail because of personality factors, or such things as age 
differences. "It's not things that are hard to change that seem to be at the 
heart of marital problems," Markman says. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, the critical factors are how well couples communicate, and whether 
they can agree on ways to handle the conflicts that are inevitable in any 
intimate relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Markman and Notarius find "six simple truths of marriage": 
</P>
<P>
 * Each relationship contains a reservoir of hope. "We find that most partners 
retain their wish for relationship improvement even when the going is toughest" 
-- a source of great potential. The problem is that people's attempts to 
improve things often have destructive effects. 
</P>
<P>
 * One "zinger" will erase 20 acts of kindness. "Our research has shown that it 
takes one put-down to undo hours of kindness you give to your partner. . . . 
Intimate partners must learn how to manage their anger and control the exchange 
of negative behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 * Little changes in you can lead to huge changes in the relationship. "Add to 
your relationship acts of thoughtful kindness -- compliment your partner on how 
he or she looks, touch your partner's back when you walk by -- and subtract 
from your relationship acts of thoughtless nastiness -- ignoring your partner 
when you are angry, calling your partner names. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you live and breathe this formula, you can rediscover and preserve 
feelings of love, attraction and satisfaction in your relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 * It's not the differences between partners that cause problems but how the 
differences are handled when they arise. "Rather than focusing on areas of 
agreement and disagreement, partners in happy relationships develop good 
listening skills . . . (which) involve understanding and acceptance of 
differences in personality and taste. Having a good listener is having a good 
friend. In a happy relationship, a partner can count on his or her mate's being 
a good friend and never a judge or counselor." 
</P>
<P>
 * Men and women fight using different weapons but suffer similar wounds. For 
various reasons, men often have a harder time handling conflict, and women have 
a harder time tolerating emotional distance, Markman and Notarius write. When 
couples learn to monitor and contain their responses, they learn to work 
together to achieve the closeness that both partners want. 
</P>
<P>
 * Partners need to practice relationship skills to become good at them. 
"Partners enter into relationships with no agreed-upon rules or skills for 
handling the strong negative feelings that are an inevitable part of all 
relationships. Without rules, in the face of conflict, partners often resort to 
forms of guerrilla warfare with random sniping that can seriously wound their 
mates. Instead of taking control of conflict, partners let conflict take 
control of them." 
</P>
<P>
 "We find that many people are motivated to work on their relationship," 
Markman says. "They just don't know exactly what to do."

CYBURBS OFFER REFUGE TO LIFE-WEARY URBANITES; COMPUTERS: THE INFORMATION 
HIGHWAY LEADS TO THE LAND OF GAMES, BUT IT'S A PATH THAT MAY BE HIGHLY 
ADDICTIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Welcome to the Cyburbs, that computer-driven game land on the outskirts of 
Reality just off the Information Highway where more of us are stopping these 
days to avoid getting a life. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, we're succeeding. 
</P>
<P>
 For while we may cluck publicly about our kids wasting time and mind with TV 
video games like "Mortal Kombat," it turns out that we, their parents, are 
privately firing up the PC and going bug-eyed till dawn playing "Falcon3," the 
next best thing to a government warplane simulator. 
</P>
<P>
 Or "Links 386 Pro," which simulates a round of golf at Hilton Head Island. Or 
"Betrayal at Krondor," or "The 7th Guest," or "The Castle of Dr. Brain" or 
"CyberStrike." 
</P>
<P>
 Or you name it. Highly sophisticated computer games -- both the boxed variety 
available in software stores and those available only through on-line network 
services -- have gotten their hooks into more grown-ups than would like to 
admit it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Computer games have the potential for real addictiveness," says Johnny 
Wilson, editor of Computer Gaming World, where gamers who go overboard are 
jokingly referred to as "cyburbs." 
</P>
<P>
 But Michelle M. Weil, of Orange, Calif., a recognized authority on the effects 
of computer use on the psyche, isn't joking when she says, "Computer games are 
extremely addictive." And not just the store-bought ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think playing on-line network games has a much higher addictive potential 
than regular computer games," says Weil. "With a (boxed) computer game, you're 
always aware it is a game. With on-line types of services, people can spend 
lots of time talking in the protection of their own home or office with no 
face-to-face interaction. The underlying danger: The more time you spend facing 
the screen the less time you spend doing other things." 
</P>
<P>
 Endless anecdotes scroll forth from gaming groups about people spending $800 
or more a year on boxed computer games, or those spending so much time playing 
multi-player, on-line games with unseen opponents at $3 an hour that they run 
up annual bills as high as $15,000. Some networks, recognizing the potential 
for problems, encourage subscribers to set limits on the amount of time they 
spend. Says one network representative, "They are so engrossing that players 
have no perception of time. People have to slap you on the head or set an alarm 
to tell you when to quit." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not unlike alcohol consumption," says gamer Steve Ames, a free-lance 
photographer in Alexandria, Va., by day and devotee of "Falcon3" in his off 
hours. "Some people savor the flavor. Some just like to take the edge off. And 
then there are those that binge. Some make the joke, 'I should have a life.' 
There's more than a little bit of nervous laughter about that." 
</P>
<P>
 And there should be, says Valerie Lorenz, a Baltimore psychologist who heads 
the National Center for Pathological Gambling Inc. "We know that many people 
become totally mesmerized by computer games," says Lorenz, who sees many 
similar behavior patterns between avid computer gamers and compulsive gamblers. 
"Unfortunately, nothing is ever done about it. There is no visible negative 
impact other than the tremendous amount of time spent. There is no concrete 
problem such as loss of money, so people tend not to see it as a problem, where 
it really is." 
</P>
<P>
 When GEnie, a Rockville, Md.-based company that offers games and a variety of 
information services, agreed to arrange an on-line question-and-answer session 
for the Baltimore Sun, about 40 players from across the United States and 
Canada weighed in with their comments during a two-hour period. 
</P>
<P>
 Most said the cost of gaming wasn't an issue for them, but they were divided 
on whether heavy game-playing kept them from real-life friendships. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you spend too much time on-line, the real world can suffer to the point 
that the only people you are left with is the on-line types," offered Bruce 
Gessleman from Texas. Another player, identified only as Jay from Sun Valley, 
Calif., added, "Sure, you can play games and have relationships on-line, but it 
just isn't the same as a face-to-face relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 And it's time, not money, that is at issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "With my job and Army Reserves and gaming, the family does resent the time I 
spend," said an attorney from Annandale, Va., commenting via the GEnie network. 
"But at least I'm home most nights." 
</P>
<P>
 That's similar to what another "Falcon3" buff from Virginia said earlier. "I 
tell my wife it could be much worse. I could have bought a bass boat and still 
have nothing to show and be gone on weekends." 
</P>
<P>
 But such arguments sound a lot like rationalizing to Lorenz. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's classic denial," she says. "Anything done to excess, one would have to 
evaluate the real reason for it, not the stated reason. Compulsive gamblers say 
they gamble for money, but they gamble because they can't tolerate the pain or 
the difficulty they are having in relating to their family or job stresses."

FIRST PERSON: MARRIAGE SEPARATES MEN FROM THEIR TOYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN REIMER, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The moment I walked into the house, I knew instinctively that I didn't belong 
-- that none of my kind had been there for more than a weekend. The other women 
at the party given by the bachelor knew it, too. "My God," whispered one, as we 
tiptoed through his apartment, "this belongs in a museum." 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly. 
</P>
<P>
 He is young, very successful and very handsome, and he had outfitted his house 
by the water with every toy known to men. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a kind of compact Disneyland for guys. No sign of a woman's touch 
anywhere except in its immaculate cleanliness. And that woman probably visits 
only every other Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sliding glass doors frame a view of the water. Outside, there's a hot tub on 
the deck next to the hammock. A power boat, a catamaran, a windsurfer are 
docked nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 His basement game room is exactly that. Ping-Pong table, pool table, dart 
board, and a beautifully crafted cherry-wood bar, complete with a brass foot 
rail and every liquor and liqueur ever concocted. His state-of-the-art 
weightlifting machines are surrounded by a wall of mirrors. Nearby is a walk-in 
closet, empty but for 100 hangers that wait patiently for a party like this 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 In an upstairs family room, the head of a wild boar (wearing sunglasses) is 
mounted on the wall. Nearby, a bear skin and a deer's head. The bachelor had 
been hunting in Alaska this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The dining-room set is immense, including a huge breakfront that housed, not 
grandma's china, but a collection of crystal wine glasses. In the kitchen's 
pantry, soda is stacked on each shelf. No Frosted Flakes, no Fruit Roll-ups, no 
Spaghetti-O's. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to see the bedrooms," the women say to each other, whispering still. 
What boudoir tastes does the game room portend, we all wonder, though no one 
dares say it. 
</P>
<P>
 The master bath has a Jacuzzi tub, a stereo radio in the shower and glass 
shelves on which eight different colognes are displayed. No makeup bags, no 
curling irons. No fussy lace shower curtain. 
</P>
<P>
 And the bedroom . . . the bedroom. We are almost afraid to look. 
</P>
<P>
 Above the bed, a black velvet painting of a panther superimposed on an ancient 
pyramid. Stereo in the corner. We laugh nervously and quickly leave. 
</P>
<P>
 The quintessential guy place. So close to the core of manliness that the women 
-- the wives -- feel so ill at ease we want to sip our drinks in the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 Discreetly, I ask the men -- the husbands -- what they think. But like the 
family dog, domestication seems to have erased their memories of life in the 
wild. "I think it needs a woman's touch," says one husband, and then he changes 
the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 My own husband walks straight to the pool table as if drawn by a magnet. I 
didn't know he played. How could I not have known he played? He keeps winning. 
How could I not have known that he was good at it? 
</P>
<P>
 Later, I find him staring at the glistening steel of the weight machines and 
their reflection in the mirrors around them. "The only time I get to use my 
weights," I hear him say, "is when I move them out of the way to get to the 
lawn mower." 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't know he still had those weights. 
</P>
<P>
 I confess that since we consolidated our households, my husband's treasures -- 
the bust of an American Indian, the painting he had done of a hang glider, the 
knight's helmet ice bucket that held his change -- made their way, slowly, 
secretly, out of our decorating scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing this bachelor pad made me ashamed that I had supplanted all his stuff 
with all of mine. 
</P>
<P>
 There are lace curtains in the bedroom he must share with me, and a gaggle of 
handmade dolls sit atop the quilted bedspread. I don't recall ever asking him 
what he would like to hang above the bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Our garage holds not only his weights, but also his other keepsakes. His Iron 
City beer poster of the Pittsburgh Steelers, his painting of a mountain 
landscape, his model airplanes. Even the miniature railroad he creates each 
Christmas with the train his father gave him as an infant has moved from the 
family room to the garage. "I'll buy a space heater," he said cheerfully. 
</P>
<P>
 And so my face goes crimson and I stutter when, as we drive home from the 
bachelor's party, my husband asks: "What ever happened to my Indian head statue 
anyway?"

LAUSD RESPONSE TO QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * George Ramos' comments in "Maligned School District's Muscle Comes in Handy 
in Crisis" (Jan. 31) couldn't have been further off the mark. He and Marshall 
Diaz argue that the bureaucratic blob of an LAUSD is better able to deal with 
emergencies than smaller districts would be. They still don't get it. In times 
of emergencies, where people are often isolated, it is community-based groups 
and facilities that come to the rescue. Bureaucracies lack the ability to do 
much other than throw bales of money out of helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 Money alone does not solve the problem. How do Ramos and Diaz explain the fact 
that Vaughn Street Elementary School, an independent charter in one of the 
poorest and hardest hit areas, was able to open sooner than its nearby cousins 
in the Los Angeles Unified School District? It was thanks to independent 
leadership, community-based efforts, and the flexibility to get back on-line. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Chambers of Commerce and other private volunteer organizations from 
the Valley have been working directly with FEMA, the SBA, and other government 
agencies to help direct assistance to critical areas of the commercial and 
public infrastructure. Valley groups have a long history of taking on issues 
that would normally be handled by local government. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been a number of public officials who have used the quake to 
rekindle the Valley vs. Basin debate. Some have had the incredibly bad taste to 
suggest that the Valley is getting too much attention. This kind of attention 
we don't need. To be deprived of local control of our schools is one thing -- 
but to point to the bureaucratic chaos and tell us how fortunate we are is 
insulting.

 * I read with great interest "Closings No Vacation for Youths, Teachers" (Jan. 
31). I am the producer of the 10-year-old award-winning Homework Hotline 
television series. While our live show is geared to answering homework 
questions, we are adapting the show to the post-earthquake situation. Our 
teachers are offering more structured lessons, and suggesting many tips and 
strategies for self-directed learning. In fact, tuning in on any day can 
provide a dose of instruction to students of virtually any age or grade level. 
</P>
<P>
 While Homework Hotline won't garner student viewers a grade, or settle the 
score regarding high school sports standings, we're confident that making the 
effort to watch the program will impress college admittance offices -- at least 
to indicate that the students who watch the show in lieu of attending their 
regular (and now unavailable) classes are trying their best to complete their 
studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Homework Hotline is seen live on KLCS, Channel 58 (as well as 110 local cable 
systems in Ventura, Orange, Los Angeles, San Bernardino and Riverside counties) 
every Monday through Thursday from 4:30 to 5:30 p.m.

 * We are all stunned by the amount of damages, disruption and costs to repair 
Los Angeles schools. Fortunately, there is a lot that the citizens of Los 
Angeles and the Los Angeles Unified School District can do to overcome the 
damages and begin building and modernizing schools for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 With an assessed value of over $200 billion, LAUSD has the largest property 
tax base in the state. At a tax rate, for example, of 3 cents per $100 of 
assessed value (that's just $30 per year for a $100,000 property), LAUSD could 
conservatively generate more than $750 million in school construction bonds. 
With any appreciable matching funds from the federal or state level, LAUSD 
could be well on the road to earthquake recovery as well as relieving 
overcrowding and deterioration.

 JUST LIKE OPRAH: You know those TV talk shows where you can call up and plug 
yourself right into the discussion? They'll do the same thing at the Irvine 
City Council chambers on Wednesday, for a much different cause. . . . The 
council and the Irvine Chamber of Commerce will hold a joint community forum on 
the future of the El Toro air base. It will be televised live on cable. 
Officials are inviting viewers to call in during the 7 to 9 p.m. meeting to 
give opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 GO FOR THE GREEN: The annual gift reports for county officials shows that many 
of them love golf. Now they have a chance to get into the golf business and 
even make a little money for the public. . . . The Irvine Ranch Water District 
has invited the county to become a partner in building an 18-hole course on 
about 200 acres near the Sand Canyon Reservoir. . . . The proposed joint 
venture, dubbed as a "revenue generator" in a county starved for additional 
golf courses, will be considered by the county supervisors on Tuesday.

 NEVER TOO LATE: Audrey Hauth, a retired schoolteacher from Seal Beach, was 
active in tennis, but her daughter convinced her she probably couldn't run 
three blocks. "She was right too," Hauth says. That was some 15 years ago. 
Hauth, now 60, has been running since. She's one of only two women who has run 
in all 12 Long Beach marathons. She's back for the annual marathon again today. 
Says Hauth: "It's a great race, very runner-friendly." 
</P>
<P>
 REMEMBERING JOE: A shorter run will take place in Anaheim Hills this morning. 
But some participants have a special reason for showing up: More than 1,000 
police officers and firefighters from throughout Southern California will 
compete in a "Joe Molloy Memorial Division" of Anaheim Memorial Hospital's 5K / 
10K walk-run. They'll raise scholarships to honor Molloy, the Anaheim police 
chief who died of a heart attack last July. He was an avid runner and fitness 
buff.

CASE OF SHADOWY DOCTOR INCLUDES POISONINGS, LIES, DEATHS, HUBRIS; MEDICINE: 
MICHAEL SWANGO CHARMED HIS WAY INTO JOBS DESPITE HIS TROUBLED PAST. MEDICAL

 Barron Harris walked into a New York hospital last September, sick with 
pneumonia. Days later, he lapsed into a coma. Weeks later, he died. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knew why. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks earlier, Andrew Woods had entered the same hospital. He, too, had 
pneumonia, and he says he developed seizures. 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't know why. 
</P>
<P>
 The two military veterans of two generations had one common bond: Michael 
Kirk, the charming doctor who had prescribed some of their medication and 
hovered attentively nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kirk was concealing a web of frightening secrets: He had lied to his 
patients about his name, he had lied to his superiors about his criminal 
record, and he had lied to everyone about his troubled past. 
</P>
<P>
 The solicitous doctor -- real name, Michael Joseph Swango -- had served two 
years in an Illinois prison for tainting fellow paramedics' food with ant 
poison. He had been under suspicion years ago in several Ohio hospital deaths. 
His medical license had been revoked in two states. And he had been kicked out 
of a South Dakota medical school. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came New York, the latest stop in a bizarre 11-year odyssey of a troubled 
man so determined to be a doctor that he stitched together half-truths and 
out-and-out lies to manipulate the medical Establishment, exploit the legal 
system and cajole his way into a world of life-and-death decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Swango lost his job in New York when his past was revealed. He has not been 
charged with wrongdoing there, but the FBI is investigating. 
</P>
<P>
 His story is more than a tale of a once brilliant, promising young student 
with a diabolical mind and a ghoulish fascination with gore. It's a cautionary 
example of how medical authorities blindly trusted one of their own, violating 
their own common-sense policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's outrageous that something like this could pop up time and time again," 
said Dennis Cashman, the Illinois judge who sentenced Swango to prison in 1985 
for the poisonings. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Last summer, Michael Swango was among 12 of 190 applicants to win a 
psychiatric residency at what was then the University Hospital at Stony Brook. 
Just months earlier, the school's emergency medical department -- nine floors 
up -- had rejected his application, citing too many gaps in his resume. 
</P>
<P>
 While being interviewed by Dr. Alan Miller, director of the Psychiatric 
Residency Program, Swango volunteered that he had been convicted of battery in 
a barroom brawl. He did not mention, however, that he had served time for 
poisoning colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 No one checked his story or his credentials, a violation of policy. But it was 
not the first time Swango had sweet-talked his way into a job. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a pathological charmer," said Stephen Villano, associate dean at the 
medical school. "He found a sympathetic ear and pushed the right buttons, 
asking to be given a second chance." 
</P>
<P>
 "This was no slouch that he had to convince," Villano said of Miller, a 
respected mental health expert who has served as a consultant worldwide. "But 
Swango was so polished he was able to fool this giant." 
</P>
<P>
 Swango, 39, was assigned to Northport Veterans Administration Medical Center 
in August. At some point, he changed his name. He told some folks that it was 
to make a fresh start, others that it was his stepfather's name. 
</P>
<P>
 The reports were glowing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was extremely caring," said Andrew Woods, a 41-year-old Vietnam veteran 
and Northport patient. "He'd spend a long time, sometimes hours, just talking, 
asking me how I was." 
</P>
<P>
 Woods said Kirk -- the name he knew him by -- never gave him medication 
directly, but wrote prescriptions for it. When he developed mysterious 
seizures, he said, his wife had him transferred. 
</P>
<P>
 Barron Harris, a 60-year-old Korean War veteran, was hospitalized Sept. 29 
with a fever. The retired cabinet-maker, who had emphysema, was transferred to 
intensive care, where he became agitated and began tearing out his IV tubes, 
his widow said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsie Harris said Swango -- they, too, knew him as Kirk -- told her he gave 
her husband a sedative Oct. 2. A day later, Harris lapsed into a coma. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said to Dr. Kirk, 'How? Why?' " she recalled. Elsie Harris said he told her 
he hoped it wasn't something he -- or others there -- had done to put her 
husband in that state. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris died Nov. 9; autopsy results have yet to be released. 
</P>
<P>
 The Harris and Woods families and a third patient have filed suits totaling 
$30 million against the State of New York, alleging malpractice and negligence, 
but Swango has not been sued. His whereabouts are unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts by the Associated Press to reach him at his former apartment and 
through a stepbrother were unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 He was dismissed by Stony Brook in October, and Miller resigned days later. 
But that doesn't ease the pain for some who had trusted him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was someone you would want to bring home to meet your daughter," Elsie 
Harris said of Swango. "Sometimes, I would walk in and he'd be standing there 
alone at the head of my husband's bed, just looking at him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now," she added, "we would like to rip him apart." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The road to New York began in Quincy, Ill., a quiet Mississippi River town, 
where Michael Swango seemed destined for success. 
</P>
<P>
 The blond, hazel-eyed student was a clarinet player, school band president and 
valedictorian. He was voted Most Likely to Succeed in the class of 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 Classmate Steve Siebers said Swango was highly motivated and "probably the 
smartest kid I've ever known." He remembers him excelling in a physics class 
that bewildered everyone else. He also recalls that Swango seemed to overreact 
when peers teased him. 
</P>
<P>
 Swango's father, now dead, was a decorated Army veteran who served in Vietnam. 
The son won a music scholarship, but dropped out to join the Marines. 
</P>
<P>
 After the military, Swango enrolled in Quincy College, hoping to become a 
doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wrote glowing reports for him to get into medical school. He was very 
conscientious," recalled William Gasser, his chemistry professor -- who later 
analyzed tea Swango had been suspected of poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 John Natalini, his college adviser, admired Swango's tenacity. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got very good grades. He spoke well. He was a gentleman," said Natalini, 
who later shipped science journals to Swango in prison. "Nothing would say 
there's going to be problems in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 But the problems started soon after. 
</P>
<P>
 At Southern Illinois University School of Medicine in Springfield, Swango was 
regarded as a loner; peers called his last-minute cramming "Swango-ing," and he 
stretched himself even more by working part time as a paramedic. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of his last year in medical school, some members of a student 
governing body moved to have him expelled. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. David Chapman, a classmate who now is a doctor in Springfield, said he and 
others thought Swango was doing a superficial job working with patients -- he 
would jot down their histories in five minutes, when they should take an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The group failed to win the unanimous backing required for expulsion, but did 
succeed in holding Swango back in school, Chapman said. Swango lost a 
neurosurgery residency in Iowa, but he did graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His next stop was Ohio. There was more trouble there. 
</P>
<P>
 Swango lasted only one year at an Ohio State University Hospitals internship 
that was supposed to lead to a three-year neurosurgery residency. 
</P>
<P>
 He left in 1984. The official reason: He didn't perform well. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a year later, Ohio authorities, contacted by the Quincy Police 
Department for a background check on Swango, discovered there was more to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward Morgan, an assistant Franklin County prosecutor, said he and Ohio State 
police learned the hospitals had conducted a secret, internal probe prompted by 
an unusual number of code blues, or emergency alerts, that led to several 
unexpected patient deaths or suspicious illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 All occurred in areas where Swango had worked, Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an affidavit taken by campus police at least 18 months later, a nurse said 
she entered a woman's room to find Swango "putting what appeared to be 
something into the patient's IV tube line with a syringe." 
</P>
<P>
 A code blue was called; the patient had stopped breathing. After the patient 
was revived, she wrote a note saying a blond person had injected her IV. A 
nurse's aide said she saw Swango leave a room down the hall and found a syringe 
in a sink in that room. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan said three bodies were exhumed to test for poisons; none was found. But 
he also noted that castor beans found in Swango's Quincy apartment can be used 
to produce a poison that tests can't detect. 
</P>
<P>
 In one exhumation, a man believed to have died in 1984 due to injuries from an 
automobile accident was found to have a wad of gauze stuck down his throat. 
There was no medical reason for it, said attorney Wayne Link, who represented 
the widow in an unsuccessful suit against the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The coroner ruled the death a homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Link said the widow had learned of her husband's death from Swango, who called 
her and kept repeating the news to her. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan reported another strange occurrence: Doctors at a hospital on Swango's 
rotation became violently ill -- some vomited so hard they broke blood vessels 
in their eyes -- after eating chicken Swango purportedly purchased at a 
fast-food restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said the symptoms were consistent with arsenic poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 But the trail was cold by time his office learned what had gone on, Morgan 
said. Syringes and other physical evidence had disappeared, fingerprints 
weren't taken, and Swango hadn't been interviewed by a trained investigator. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you what a hospital should do when they think they have an 
intern running amok," Morgan said. "They made an inquiry to what the heck was 
going on and . . . they got rid of the problem. But the problem continued for 
other people." 
</P>
<P>
 Malcolm Baroway, director of communications at Ohio State University, said the 
hospital's first internal probe was aided by an attorney who said they didn't 
have evidence that would hold up in court. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Quincy case surfaced, the university president, who had been unaware 
of the hospital probe, ordered an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 That report concluded the first probe was inadequate, but noted that personal 
animosities and low morale may have given rise for someone "to find blame when 
none was warranted." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan doesn't buy it. 
</P>
<P>
 'If it was just one or two incidents, fine," he said. "If you add it all 
together, you've got a sick puppy here." 
</P>
<P>
 "Where's there smoke, there's fire. And there was a lot of smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By the summer of 1984, Swango was back in Quincy, working part time as a 
paramedic. That fall, several paramedics reported becoming ill after eating 
doughnuts he brought to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Brent Unmisig ate one and vomited. The next night, the paramedic says, Swango 
handed him a soft drink at a football game. He got sick again. 
</P>
<P>
 He and other paramedics discovered that their symptoms -- nausea, vomiting, 
dizziness, headaches -- matched those of arsenic poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks later, Unmisig said, when some paramedics faked a call 35 minutes away 
to divert Swango, others found arsenic-based ant poison in his bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, one paramedic left a pitcher of unsweetened tea when a crew was 
dispatched for a call. When they returned, it was sweet; a co-worker said he 
saw Swango leaving the area. Tests found arsenic in the tea. 
</P>
<P>
 After Swango was arrested, Tero ant poison, books on satanism, guns, survival 
knives and recipe cards for pesticides, botulism and cyanide mixtures were 
found in his apartment. Some co-workers were not surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would call people on calls that had been pretty gruesome and try to elicit 
details," said Mark Krzystofczyk, a former paramedic. "He kept a scrapbook." 
</P>
<P>
 Trial testimony painted a grisly portrait: Swango cheering TV reports of a 
shooting rampage in California, saying, "Every time I get a good idea, someone 
beats me to it," expressing admiration for serial killers, and saying the 
ultimate call would be a tanker crashing into a busload of kids, creating an 
explosion that would impale them. 
</P>
<P>
 Swango denied the poisonings, but admitted to some ghoulish remarks, saying he 
was trying to defuse tension. 
</P>
<P>
 Medical professionals concede that black humor is common in such situations. 
And paramedics concede there was another side to him -- the calm, cool, 
consummate professional. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worse the call," Unmisig said, "the better he would act and perform." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said they didn't think he was trying to kill anyone, and Swango 
was convicted of aggravated battery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't know what his motive was," Unmisig said. "I was never mean to 
the man. I didn't do anything to harm him or embarrass him." 
</P>
<P>
 In sentencing Swango to the maximum five years, Judge Cashman said he didn't 
understand how someone so smart could leave such a blatant trail. 
</P>
<P>
 But Swango maintained his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 "In no way, shape or form, under no conceivable circumstances," he said, "am I 
now or could I ever be, a danger to any human being on the face of the earth." 
</P>
<P>
 Swango served two years in prison and was released in August, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his release, in a 1986 interview with the ABC-TV show "20/20," he again 
denied wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could never do any of the things that have been alleged I've done," he 
said. "I think my whole life speaks for that, everything I've done in the past 
-- my work, both as a paramedic and a doctor -- and . . . I simply could have 
not done those things." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After Swango's release, Cashman said, he received calls from private 
medical-placement groups, including one in Atlanta, inquiring about Swango's 
character. "I just told them it probably would be wise to stay away from 
assisting him," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge also said he heard reports that Swango had forged documents 
suggesting he helped a fellow doctor in a brawl and had been pardoned for his 
crime. He is angry that those accounts have been accepted at face value. 
</P>
<P>
 "The medical profession has a certain arrogance that they would choose to 
believe a doctor over the courts," Cashman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Published reports in 1989 indicate Swango worked at a medical-career 
vocational school and placement center in Newport News, Va., where three 
co-workers became ill; police say they don't comment on investigations unless 
charges are filed. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Swango legally changed his name to David Jackson Adams and was 
certified as an emergency medical technician in Virginia. While working for an 
ambulance company, a hospital nurse recognized him -- possibly from the TV 
interview -- as a doctor who had served time in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1991, hospital officials told the state Office of Emergency 
Medical Services they had learned that Adams -- who had reverted back to Swango 
by then -- had been convicted in a poisoning case, agency official Scott 
Winston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Winston notified Swango of potential problems because of a state law 
prohibiting felons from holding that job. Swango repeatedly balked when asked 
for records pertaining to his conviction, Winston said, and the issue died. He 
retained his job. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the same time, using the Adams name, he applied to the Ohio Valley 
Medical Center in Wheeling, W.Va. 
</P>
<P>
 "To tell you the truth, we liked the guy," said Dr. Jeffrey Shultz, who heads 
the internal medicine residency program. 
</P>
<P>
 But the name change and an admission that he had been in prison -- he again 
claimed it was for a bar fight -- alarmed Shultz, who contacted Illinois 
authorities and learned the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made the hair stand up on the back of my neck," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1989 to 1991, Ohio State received inquiries about Swango from hospital or 
medical boards in North Dakota; Washington, D.C.; and Virginia. It's not known 
if those were the only places where he tried to get a foothold back into 
medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Swango was back in a hospital setting again -- despite his admission 
that he had served time for poisoning co-workers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to know this guy," said Dr. Anthony Salem, director of the 
internal medicine residency program at the University of South Dakota School of 
Medicine, which accepted Swango into a one-year program. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had convinced me not only that he was not guilty . . . but that it was a 
total miscarriage of justice." 
</P>
<P>
 Salem said Swango told him he didn't understand why he had been arrested in 
the poisonings because he had gotten sick himself. He said he'd changed his 
name to start over, but had reverted to his original one when it became a 
hassle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believed him rather than calling the court and saying, 'Send me the 
documents.' . . . I said, 'Well, shoot, let's give him a chance.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Salem said he did check Swango out -- he knew he lost his medical license in 
Illinois and Ohio for an unspecified felony and was denied a license in 
Virginia -- but thought he knew why, so he didn't pursue it. 
</P>
<P>
 But just before Thanksgiving, 1992, South Dakota officials were alerted to 
Swango's past by two developments, Salem said: He applied for membership in the 
American Medical Assn., and some hospital employees saw an updated rerun of his 
"20/20" interview on cable. 
</P>
<P>
 Swango was confronted, dismissed and lost his appeal in February, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, just before those events, Salem said he told Swango he was 
performing well enough to keep him past his year's residency. A check of 
medical records in cases where Swango may have been involved found no 
irregularities, Salem added. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Salem said he's embarrassed, he's not calling for new safeguards to 
prevent this from happening again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you set up a major national system to catch this aberration that comes up 
1 in 1 million or 2 million?" he asked. "There was ample opportunity for those 
people we contacted to say, you better think about this." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, at least one hospital decided to take the initiative in doing just 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 After he was dismissed, officials at Stony Brook sent letters to 126 medical 
schools -- where Swango must apply to complete his residency -- alerting them 
to his history. Villano said more than 60 requested his photo. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that was after Swango had slipped through their safety net. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his strange history, Michael Swango still arouses sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do I still think he's a human being capable of being a contributing member to 
society? Yes, I do," said attorney Daniel Cook, who represented Swango in 
Quincy and was his high school history teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's somewhat of a shame to see him in this situation," said high school 
classmate Siebers. "I would have expected a lot of great things from him." 
</P>
<P>
 Others are less charitable, and more leery of his next step. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's trying to find a niche where somebody is going to believe his smiling 
face and take him at his word," said Chet Vahle, who prosecuted Swango in 
Quincy. "He wants to be a doctor and he's willing to do anything he has to do 
to get there." 
</P>
<P>
 Krzystofczyk, the former paramedic, puts it another way. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all figure," he said, "Mike's not done yet." 
</P>

JUSTICE SYSTEM QUESTIONED IN GIRL'S HIT-RUN DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW WATERS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The impact hurled Lisa Doell out of her shoes and into a tree. 
</P>
<P>
 A 12-year-old girl who loved to dance, she was walking along the road on that 
autumn day when the car struck her from behind, almost squarely at the knees. 
At first she was knocked backward, her head denting the hood. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no skid marks -- and no witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, passers-by found a license plate. And that led to the arrest of a 
16-year-old boy who had told friends of rape fantasies and had written grisly 
poetry -- who, in fact, told police he had killed Lisa Doell. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't an accident. I did it on purpose," Andrew Whitaker said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a year after Lisa's death, a jury rendered a surprising verdict: Whitaker 
was not guilty of murder, but of manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 There was another surprising twist: The prosecutor blamed the steadfastness of 
one juror for this failure to convict on the more serious charge. Twenty years 
earlier, that juror's son had hit a child who ran in front of his car. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe Andy Whitaker got away with murder," said Lake Oswego police Cpl. 
Michael Hammons. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammons investigated the case that has so troubled this affluent suburb of 
Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial marks the scene of Lisa's death -- a picture of a girl with curly 
blond hair and a wide smile; a poem about why God would reclaim a child so 
early in life. Children still drop by to leave candy. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who knew her recall Lisa's charisma, her enthusiasm and her knack for 
negotiating peace among her many friends. Her nickname was "Peacer." 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a sparkle," said Dottie Fields, Lisa's dance instructor. "There's no 
doubt in my mind that Lisa would have found a place for herself in the theater 
world. . . . She was unusually talented." 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 20, 1992, the day before her death, Lisa was on her way to dance 
lessons when she saw someone staring at her from a car. As she later told her 
mother, the episode scared her enough to duck into a frozen yogurt shop. When 
she came out, the car was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammons said Whitaker talked with a classmate, Matthew Dickman, that night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Andy talked about girls and how he had never kissed a girl," Hammons said. 
"He also talked about impulses, and he said he saw a girl walking down the 
street and he had an impulse to stop and rape her." 
</P>
<P>
 Was Whitaker the man who unnerved Lisa? It's not known. 
</P>
<P>
 What is known is that shortly before 4 p.m. the next day, Lisa Doell died on 
North Shore Road. And about 4:15 p.m. that day, Dickman later testified, 
Whitaker drove to his house and said he just hit someone with his parents' car. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'I went through with one of my impulses,' " Dickman testified. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At LaSalle High School, said Principal Timothy Edwards, Whitaker was an 
"average to better" student who enjoyed poetry and literature. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was quite intelligent and his grades got better as he proceeded. He was 
quiet and quite reserved," Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Whitaker's tranquil appearance belied an emotionally volatile side. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice, LaSalle Vice Principal William George had called 911 when Whitaker 
appeared to be having panic attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammons said writings found in his room revealed a disturbed, irrational 
personality, "a person not knowing which way to go, what to do -- not knowing 
what was real and what wasn't. The kid was messed up. No doubt about it." 
</P>
<P>
 How he got that way is a matter of speculation. Hammons says Whitaker hates 
his mother and stepfather and had "a terrible family life." 
</P>
<P>
 In a $10-million wrongful death lawsuit against the Whitakers and their son, 
Lisa's mother charges that the Whitakers physically and mentally abused Andrew 
for 10 years when they knew or should have known that such abuse could result 
in violent behavior by him that could injure someone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Andrew Whitaker nor his parents would comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Trial testimony portrays a very troubled youth. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, English teacher Timothy Joy read one of Whitaker's poems, "The 
People's Possum." In it, a baby possum is struck by an automobile and "squashed 
like a pumpkin on Hallow's Eve." 
</P>
<P>
 Joy said Whitaker gave him the poem less than an hour before Lisa Doell's 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 During jury selection, potential juror Betty Maxwell acknowledged that her son 
had been involved in an accident two decades before. But Deputy District 
Attorney Michael P. Regan allowed her on the panel; he was convinced that she 
could separate the two incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Andrew Whitaker who testified was not so confessional as the one police 
interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 He testified that he was depressed and upset about personal problems as he 
drove home from high school the day of Lisa's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember seeing her, but I didn't realize she was there," he said. He said 
he did not speed up, swerve or put on his brakes. "I was scared." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he told his schoolmates that he had given in to an impulse partly 
because "it seemed so unreal to me." 
</P>
<P>
 And when he told police it wasn't an accident, he was confused and merely 
trying to accept responsibility, Whitaker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was trying to tell him it was my fault," he said. "My interpretation of an 
accident is where no one is at fault." 
</P>
<P>
 The jury deliberated 16 hours over three days before convicting Whitaker on 
manslaughter charges. Two of the 12 jurors voted against a murder conviction, 
which must be unanimous; one of them was Maxwell, who later said she voted for 
acquittal because of her son's experience and was sympathetic toward Whitaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trial bothered me bad enough. But it's all the criticism I've been 
getting," she said. "I still feel I did the right thing." 
</P>
<P>
 She feels the evidence against Whitaker was flimsy, and said other jurors 
bullied her and the other woman who voted against a murder conviction. 
</P>

 Andrew Whitaker's attorney, Gary Bertoni, did not grant a request to interview 
Whitaker at MacLaren School for Boys, a state reformatory school, where he is 
serving his three-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor, Regan, learned a sad lesson: "Now, knowing what I know, I 
probably won't put anyone on (a jury) who has any kind of connection." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he does not think the system failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand the strengths and weaknesses of the jury system," he said. "We 
are witnessing one of the great weaknesses -- that sometimes injustices occur. 
If I had to sit down and devise a better system, I could not do it."

 The Doell family is not so accepting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wake up every morning and go, 'Is Lisa really gone? Did someone really 
murder her? Did we really go through a criminal case and her murderer is being 
set free?"' said Lisa's mother, Colleen Doell. "It's just not real." 
</P>
<P>
 Her ex-husband, Steve Doell, took his outrage over the verdict to the Oregon 
Legislature, which passed a bill making it harder for people who kill with 
automobiles to regain their driver's licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 He still chokes up when talk turns to his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not been easy," Doell said. "I've not only lost my daughter, I've lost 
my best friend too." 
</P>
<P>
 Colleen Doell says she's been so focused on the criminal aspect of her 
daughter's death that she hasn't had a chance to deal with the loss -- and 
doesn't know if she ever will. 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't walk into a room, she bounced into a room, she danced into a 
room," Colleen Doell said. "It's pretty quiet in our house now."

POPULATION FLIGHT, TOURIST INVASION, NATURE GANG UP ON VENICE; ITALY: CITY'S 
SERENITY, PERHAPS ITS VERY EXISTENCE, ARE THREATENED. VARIOUS GROUPS SUGGEST 
POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS, INCLUDING REQUIRING A TICKET TO GET IN. 
</P>

<P>
 Along the Grand Canal, once-glorious Renaissance palaces are boarded up or 
hidden behind scaffolding and signs explaining that they are "in restauro" -- 
"under restoration." 
</P>
<P>
 On narrow flagstone streets, people wearing jeans and carrying cameras far 
outnumber those wearing suits and carrying briefcases. 
</P>
<P>
 In a residential area that used to be filled with vegetable markets, hardware 
stores and bakeries, shops sell papier-mache carnival masks, miniature gondolas 
and goblets decorated with bright fake jewels. 
</P>
<P>
 This city, once known as "La Serenissima," is no longer "most serene." Its 
unique character -- perhaps its very existence -- is threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 "Venice has changed. It is no longer the place I knew," said Count Alvise 
Zorzi, who grew up in Venice, has written its history and has been at the 
forefront of efforts to preserve it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Each time I return, I feel happy because I'm back to my roots," said the 
71-year-old historian, whose family ties to Venice go back nearly 1,000 years. 
"But I become sad when I have to face the concrete problems of today." 
</P>
<P>
 The problems that trouble Zorzi and Venice-lovers everywhere include a 
shrinking population, an uncontrolled tourist invasion and the ravages of 
nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Zorzi summed up their impact: "This was once a living city. Now it's like a 
holiday resort, and its future is in danger." 
</P>
<P>
 At its zenith in the 15th Century, Venice was a rich and powerful state that 
ruled a vast maritime empire. Magnificent palaces and churches, a renowned 
school of artists and the charm of its watery setting made it a rival of Paris, 
Rome and other great cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, during the last half-century or so, two elements that shaped 
Venice -- the Adriatic Sea and foreign visitors -- have become the sources of 
many of its troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Built on piles driven into the center of a crescent-shaped lagoon, Venice is 
disrupted regularly by high tides and floods that weaken the foundations of 
residences and historic buildings and leave low-lying areas like St. Mark's 
Square under water. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is the tides of tourists that are causing much of the concern these 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Venice attracts an average of 20,000 visitors a day, more than 7 million a 
year. On some days during the summer peak season, more than 100,000 clog the 
city, as many as two-thirds of them day-trippers who spend little money and 
seldom wander far from two or three major attractions, mainly St. Mark's and 
the shop-lined Rialto Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 While tourists pour into the city, old-time Venetians are pouring out. Since 
the end of World War II, Venice's population has dropped from more than 170,000 
to fewer than 75,000. The decline continues at a rate of about 1,500 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not easy to live in this city anymore," Zorzi said. "One needs a great 
deal of heroism." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the city is shabby, in constant disrepair. For centuries, boats 
cleaned the canals and repaired the foundations of the houses that lined them. 
That stopped in the 1960s because of political and budgetary problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of living is extremely high. Food, clothing, building materials and 
other goods must be brought in by boat and on foot. Garbage and other waste 
must be removed the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the huge residences have been subdivided into small apartments, but 
their aging plumbing and wiring have not been replaced. Flooding leaves the 
ground floors unlivable, and there are no elevators. 
</P>
<P>
 When buildings are renovated, their cost soars beyond the reach of average 
Venetians. Susanna Scarpa, a young tour guide, would like to live in the city, 
but she can't afford $1,250 a month for a tiny, one-room apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 So houses and apartments are sold to wealthy foreigners or to Italians from 
Milan, Florence and Rome who live in them only a few months each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the prices weren't prohibitive, blue-collar workers and middle-class 
families would leave the city to follow jobs to the mainland. There, the 
mainland suburb of Mestre has become the region's industrial center. Its 
neighbor, Marghera, has taken over much of the maritime activity. Both have 
surpassed Venice in population. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is left," Zorzi said, "is a city that serves tourists and the wealthy. 
Venice cannot survive that way." 
</P>
<P>
 This realization has aroused concern from the Rialto to Rome, from Europe to 
the United States, and has inspired a number of suggestions and plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Venice Consortium, a group of 26 Italian companies, was created in 
1984 to confront the challenges of the sea. Among its strategies is a 
sophisticated system of mobile gates that could limit the inflow of sea water 
during high tides. 
</P>
<P>
 Reversing damage done by decades of neglect will require more money and less 
politics. A push is being made for a single governing authority in place of 
Venice's local-regional-national system. 
</P>
<P>
 And what can be done about the tourist invasion? As a start, Zorzi suggests 
that local officials work with tour operators to spread out the dates that 
visitors come and to encourage them to spend time in other parts of the city 
besides its main attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Randolph H. Guthrie of New York, president of the United States-based Save 
Venice, one of many international groups working to preserve Venetian art and 
architecture, believes more drastic steps are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 One possibility, he and others suggest, would be to sell a limited number of 
visitor tickets to the historic city. But critics fear that approach would turn 
Venice into a floating museum, a Disneyland with gondolas, that shuts its gates 
each night after the last bus and train depart for the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
 Another proposal is to make Venice an international city, governed by the 
European Parliament or some similar multinational body. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever is done, Zorzi cautioned, Venice must remain a living city, 
accessible to everyone, and retain the charm, the traditions and the magic that 
made it "La Serenissima."

SOCKS' STAND-IN SOCIAL SECRETARY A PURRFECT PENMAN; POLITICS: WHITE HOUSE 
FELINE IS THE CAT'S MEOW TO HIS MANY FANS, WHO DELUGE HIM WITH CORRESPONDENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Socks the cat has a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 No, not the reports about his clawing the White House furniture and being 
banished to the basement. 
</P>
<P>
 No, not the fact that he can't roam around freely like he did in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 Socks has a much more basic problem: He has no thumbs. Because of that, he 
can't hold a pen -- so he can't answer the 200 letters a day that he receives. 
Enter special agent James Garaufis, an 8-year-old from New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 His mission during a recent trip to Washington was to help Socks answer his 
mail. 
</P>
<P>
 James, known as Jamie, was invited along with other children from across the 
country as part of a program sponsored by the Smithsonian. Their day included a 
tour of the White House, along with rooms not normally shown to the public, and 
a personal meeting with Socks. After all, it would be hard to answer someone's 
mail without having met him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was cute and cuddly -- a very nice cat," said Jamie, whose 
mother, Eleanor Prescott, is an executive producer with ABC News and whose 
father, Nicholas Garaufis, is counsel to Queens Borough President Claire 
Shulman in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie said he was impressed with the White House -- although he didn't look 
for claw marks on the furniture -- and was particularly impressed with the 
history. "It's nice to know that the President's desk was made out of a sailing 
ship," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also learned that a bust of Lincoln in the hallway near the Oval Office has 
been traditionally used to show what mood the President is in. 
</P>
<P>
 The tradition reportedly started with President Lyndon B. Johnson. When he was 
in a bad mood, aides would turn the bust outside the office to face the wall to 
warn others. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can turn his head, but we weren't allowed to," Jamie said. It was unclear 
whether that was because the statue was valuable or because President Clinton 
was in a good mood. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie said that the White House takes Socks' letters seriously and tries to 
answer all of them. The replies include a full-color photo -- with a paw-mark 
as an autograph.

FRENCH FISHERMEN RIOT TO PROTEST PRICES; EUROPE: DISTURBANCE GREETS PREMIER IN 
BRITTANY, PROMPTING GOVERNMENT PROMISES TO PROTECT THE INDUSTRY FROM FOREIGN 
COMPETITION. SIXTY-ONE PEOPLE WERE INJURED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of fishermen battled riot police Friday during a visit by Premier 
Edouard Balladur, prompting government promises to protect the ailing fishing 
industry from foreign competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said 61 people -- 25 policemen and 36 protesters and bystanders -- 
were treated for injuries they suffered in daylong clashes hours in Rennes. The 
city is the capital of Brittany, the region at the center of a violent campaign 
by fishermen across France. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 600 riot officers and paramilitary policemen repeatedly used tear 
gas, and occasionally clubs, to combat protesters armed with baseball bats, 
cudgels and paving stones ripped from the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Fishermen continued to block ports into the night, all but paralyzing traffic 
between France and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 Anxious to end the violence, Balladur pledged that his conservative government 
would act on its own to protect the French fishing industry if the 12-nation 
European Union does not move swiftly to prop up fish prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade bloc later announced that at France's request it was setting minimum 
prices for Atlantic salmon and certain types of imported white fish, meeting 
one of the protesters' key demands. The EU Commission said the prices will 
remain in effect at least until March 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Widespread violence by fishermen last week has resembled protests by French 
farmers who pressured the government to demand, and eventually win, concessions 
on farm subsidies in the recently completed world trade accord. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Puench, the fishing minister who joined Balladur in talks with a 
delegation of fishermen, said the government will cut by half the fishermen's 
required contributions for health care, retirement and other social programs. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the government promised $51 million in new aid to fishermen and 
ordered tighter customs checks on foreign fish to make sure they meet quality 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 After the latest concessions, protest leaders urged their followers in Rennes 
to disperse but indicated they would still press for formal restrictions on 
fish imports. 
</P>
<P>
 Balladur warned against further violence, saying the concessions should be 
sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 "One never obtains anything lasting by violence or excess," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Protesters, many masking their faces with scarves, pelted police with eggs, 
empty beer cans and paving stones. One protester's hand was partly severed when 
he tried to pick up a tear gas grenade. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 13 of the injured policemen required hospitalization, including two 
wounded in the legs by shots from flare pistols. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor of Rennes, Edmond Herve, and a Parliament member, Jean-Michel 
Boucheron, were beaten by protesters and escorted by riot police to City Hall, 
where they remained trapped for several hours. Fishermen overturned cars and 
smashed store windows. 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters arrived in Rennes by train and bus, some from distant ports. 
The crowd was estimated at 4,000 to 5,000, including fishermen, their wives and 
other supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 fishermen raided a Rennes supermarket, throwing imported fish to the 
ground. Two supermarkets were attacked in Arcachon, outside Bordeaux, where 
protesters blocked a highway with burning tires. 
</P>
<P>
 Normandy fishermen formed a blockade near the mouth of the Seine, preventing 
ocean traffic from reaching the port at Rouen. The port in Le Havre also was 
blocked, and fishermen in Mediterranean ports stopped work.

MOUNTAIN TRAGEDY: CHILD-SELLING CHARGE, SUICIDE; VIRGINIA: JAMES OWENS AND HIS 
WIFE, STEPHANIE, WANTED A BETTER LIFE. THEY SET OUT TO GET IT BY PEDDLING THEIR 
VALUABLES -- INCLUDING, PROSECUTORS SAY, THE CHILDREN. 
</P>

<P>
 James Owens was hungry for a new life, a new start, a new place. The forlorn 
hollows of Appalachia had little to offer the impatient man of 21 or his 
17-year-old wife, Stephanie Gail. They were ready to move on. 
</P>
<P>
 First, they sold the new furniture James' parents had bought them on credit -- 
the black leather couch and the full bedroom suite. Then they wrenched out the 
dishwasher and unscrewed the light fixtures from their double-wide trailer and 
sold those too. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, authorities say, they tried to sell the last thing holding them back: 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
 They would insist later, after being arrested in a police sting, that it was 
all a joke, that James was just "playing a game" when he offered strangers 
their 9-month-old daughter for $25,000 and the son Stephanie was carrying for 
$20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was too late. In his jail cell, James knotted a bedsheet into a noose 
and hanged himself before he was even arraigned. Stephanie was forced into 
protective custody after a judge, in an unprecedented move for a Virginia 
court, placed her unborn child in foster care. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months later, James Ira Owens was taken from his mother immediately after 
his birth. Stephanie remained free on bond, drifting from her grandparents' 
home to her mother's cramped apartment to a place with a new boyfriend now 
facing robbery charges. 
</P>
<P>
 She goes to court Feb. 28 -- her 19th birthday -- to stand trial in a case 
that offers a troubling look into the emptiness and dull ache of young lives in 
a place like Dickenson County, where the population dropped 11% in the last 
decade and the unemployment rate is slightly less than 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 After 29 overworked years in this impoverished spit of Southwest Virginia, Roy 
Rose, the director of county social services, is an expert on the sorrows of 
the hardscrabble ridges and valleys where James and Stephanie Owens were 
brought up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone who wants to get ahead in life has to leave here," Rose said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 For two years, James Owens dabbled at college. He also pumped gas, drove a 
truck and worked as a hospital security guard. He talked a lot about becoming a 
police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 But mostly, James counted on welfare checks and gifts from his parents to 
support his growing family. His wife didn't work either. She had eloped at 15, 
and with just an eighth-grade education, a baby underfoot and another on the 
way, her prospects were bleak. 
</P>
<P>
 "She mostly slept or sat around playing with that ol' Nintendo game," recalled 
her mother-in-law, Ellen Owens, 64. "She didn't have any friends. No one ever 
came to visit." 
</P>
<P>
 The yellow mobile home Ellen and Ira Owens bought and parked on their land in 
Haysi, about 30 minutes up the mountain from the county seat of Clintwood, was 
filled with new furniture and appliances for their only child and his bride. 
James' parents speak without rancor or embarrassment about his demands. 
</P>
<P>
 "No is something I never did tell the boy," said Ira Owens, who is 68. "We 
just went along with everything the boy wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 The father himself was just 15 when he went into the coal mines that scab 
Appalachia. He wanted a better life for James. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Stephanie was unfriendly and a slovenly housekeeper, said her 
mother-in-law, she "treated the young'un real good. I'll give her credit for 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 If people around here know where Stephanie is now, they're not saying, and her 
defense attorney did not respond to telephone calls or a letter seeking an 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie's pregnant mother, who lives in a grim government-subsidized housing 
complex near Haysi, said she was too ill to talk. The grandfather who helped 
rear Stephanie allowed that she "does not belong to me. She'd get on me if I 
was to say anything about her." 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Owenses haven't heard from her in months. "You can't get no sense 
out her anyway," Ellen Owens said. 
</P>
<P>
 County social workers who visited Stephanie and James found both of them to be 
resentful of the family counseling sessions and parenting classes they were 
told to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could have had a support network," Rose said. "They didn't take 
advantage of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the social services director is surprised. Teen-age marriages are 
"part of the culture in this area," he said, and the sad consequences of those 
unions are reflected in the agency's bulging files. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps to avoid having the court take their daughter, Victoria, away, the 
young couple gave temporary custody to friends, who later testified that the 
baby had cigarette burns on her hands and a foot. They also said Stephanie was 
"too rough" with the child during her visits. 
</P>
<P>
 As for James, court files quoted him as saying: "I don't trust myself or my 
wife not to hurt the baby." 
</P>
<P>
 By December, 1992, the towheaded little girl was back home and Stephanie was 
pregnant again. James no longer considered the two-bedroom trailer sufficient. 
His parents sold the land out back, which they always had planned to use as a 
family cemetery, and bought a three-bedroom trailer for $21,000. 
</P>
<P>
 After the nest egg that was supposed to put James through college was gone, 
the Owenses took out loans to buy James and Stephanie new furniture, a new Ford 
truck and a new Geo car. When the two began selling off the gifts, the older 
couple watched in puzzlement from their little brick house. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie later told investigators that she and James planned to live with 
relatives in Alabama. They already had leads on jobs: Stephanie would work at a 
K mart, her husband in an auto shop. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had anything he wanted," his mother said sadly. "Maybe we just give him 
too much. But there just wasn't no reason for this to happen. We don't know 
why. They didn't need to sell that baby." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of what did happen is still unexplained. What's clear, however, is that 
on Dec. 14, 1992, a classified ad appeared in a local paper seeking people 
"seriously interested" in adopting a baby. 
</P>
<P>
 "They interviewed potential candidates," said Commonwealth's Attorney Don 
Askins. "We have witnesses who will testify that money was discussed." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies posing as a childless Roanoke couple arranged to meet the 
Owenses in the parking lot of a fast-food restaurant in Clintwood. They said 
Stephanie, then 17, offered an ultrasound image of the son due in two months. 
</P>
<P>
 "We met a couple of times before money was ever mentioned," said investigator 
Ron Kendrick. Finally, James took the detective for a ride and made what 
sounded like a rehearsed sales pitch. "He gave me a whole spiel," Kendrick 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Owens children now are in foster care and up for adoption. Social workers 
said Stephanie often misses her supervised visits, though she has petitioned 
for the return of her children. 
</P>
<P>
 The suicide note James left in his cell was neither a confession nor an 
expression of remorse, according to the prosecutor. It was "more or less a love 
note," Askins said, but it was written to both Stephanie and another woman. 
</P>
<P>
 A search of the couple's trailer turned up several spiral notebooks that 
Stephanie had used as diaries, according to court documents. In excerpts read 
aloud during preliminary hearings and published in local newspapers, she 
mentioned her pain over the couple's decision to give up the unborn baby she 
already had named after her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I could get the money to give him so we wouldn't have to do this," she 
wrote three days after the newspaper ad ran. 
</P>
<P>
 It is in juvenile court that Stephanie Owens will be judged; if convicted, she 
could be confined until her 21st birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Bledsoe, the lawyer who handled last year's custody hearing involving 
Stephanie's unborn child, remembers her as "a gullible young girl." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how many options you think you have at 17," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 James lingered in a coma for a month before dying. His parents remember that 
Stephanie was at his bedside every day, fierce and dry-eyed, doing word 
puzzles. "She wouldn't let hardly anyone go in to see him, and she wouldn't say 
why," Ellen Owens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Juvenile probation counselor Greg Cyphers also was perplexed by the young 
woman who so desperately wanted to have a family but may have been willing to 
sell her own children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen a Stephanie that'd break your heart and a Stephanie who's 
heartbroken," Cyphers said. "I've seen Stephanie stubborn, streetwise and tough 
as a pine knot. 
</P>
<P>
 "But life'll do that to you."

OZARKS MUSIC MECCA OFF KEY FOR HOMELESS; BRANSON: SERVICE- INDUSTRY JOBS ARE 
PLENTIFUL, BUT MOST OFFER NO HEALTH BENEFITS AND PAY LITTLE MORE THAN MINIMUM 
WAGE -- NOT ENOUGH TO PAY THE HIGH RENTS.

 John Mabeus had heard all about Branson -- the fast-growing entertainment 
mecca of the Ozarks -- so when his employer went bankrupt, he headed West to 
look for work. 
</P>
<P>
 He was in for a surprise. Branson has provided a home for Anita Bryant, John 
Davidson and Bobby Vinton, but there was no place for John Mabeus. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's work everywhere but there's no place to stay," said Mabeus, a 
29-year-old heavy equipment operator from Severna Park, Md. "I can't believe 
all those stars, with all their money, can't get together and build some 
affordable housing. All guys need is a place to shower and sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 So Mabeus is homeless in Springfield, 35 miles north. And he is not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 From homeless shelters to food pantries, relief organizations are swamped with 
people who end up in Springfield, a city of about 145,000, because they can't 
find affordable housing or make a decent living in Branson. 
</P>
<P>
 "This Branson thing is getting progressively more serious," said Ellie Widmer, 
director of the Missouri Hotel, the city's largest shelter. "When people go 
there with nothing, they are marked for failure. I know hundreds and hundreds 
are doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of those seeking assistance are not the stereotypical homeless, afflicted 
with mental illness or drug and alcohol problems, relief officials say. Many 
have housing and commute to jobs in Branson but need occasional help paying for 
groceries, rent and medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of these people are what I call the 'new poor,' " said the Rev. Dorsey 
Levell, executive director of the Council of Churches of the Ozarks, based in 
Springfield. "These are people who want to work, who are . . . getting employed 
in Branson in a matter of hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there's no place to live, so they come to Springfield. Their social needs 
fall on the people of Springfield, from the single man who freezes out and 
comes to The Kitchen (a shelter) to families that are out of money." 
</P>
<P>
 Branson has received national attention for its 30-plus music theaters 
featuring top country and pop acts, which lure 5 million visitors a year. The 
town of 3,700 has exploded into a mini-Las Vegas, minus gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 Springfield, too, has prospered. Tourists bound for Branson spent almost $30 
million here in 1992, according to one study. 
</P>
<P>
 But job seekers often are caught in a cruel Catch-22. 
</P>
<P>
 Although service-industry jobs are plentiful in Branson, most offer no health 
benefits and pay little more than minimum wage -- not enough to pay the high 
rents Branson landlords can demand. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, some people hold jobs while living out of vehicles, trailers and 
tents in campgrounds. A late-fall survey by social service agencies found more 
than 250 people homeless or under-housed in Branson, although the actual number 
is believed to be much higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Relief officials say they don't know how many people who hoped to find a good 
job and shelter in Branson have given up and moved to Springfield to seek help 
from social service agencies and charities. 
</P>
<P>
 But this unwelcome aspect of Branson's boom has been felt at the Victory 
Mission, whose 65 beds have been filled beyond capacity since mid-October. 
</P>
<P>
 At Crosslines, a local assistance agency operated by the Council of Churches 
of the Ozarks, requests for food and clothing are up 15% over this time last 
year, Levell said. 
</P>
<P>
 And at the Ozarks Food Harvest, a branch of the church organization that 
supplies food to 300 social service agencies in the region, demand is also up 
10% to 15%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really can't equate that except for Branson," Levell said. "The only thing 
we can equate it to is the influx of people into this area." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Lindell and Lorrie Gavin and their two daughters came to Branson so Kim 
could work as a plasterer, but he hurt his back. After camping out in their van 
for four days, the family got gas money from a Branson church to get to the 
Missouri Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Widmer said the hotel is filled with similar stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "Working minimum-wage jobs, there's no way they can find an affordable place 
to live in Branson," she said. "As a result, there's an increase in 
homelessness, poverty and family problems. These people are suffering." 
</P>
<P>
 Drawn by tales of Branson he saw on television, Mabeus hitchhiked from 
Maryland in December, arriving broke and with blistered feet. The police 
directed him to a motel that put him up for free for one night, then he moved 
on to Springfield and the Missouri Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Mabeus said he's met about 20 others in his situation at the shelter -- men 
with construction backgrounds who are hard workers but can't work because of a 
lack of affordable housing in Branson. 
</P>
<P>
 What Branson needs, relief officials say, is several hundred low-income homes 
or trailer homes -- unlikely because of the astronomical price of land, which 
continues to sprout new theaters, restaurants, motels and golf courses. 
</P>
<P>
 Groundbreaking is set for summer on the first phase of a private housing 
complex that will include eight low-cost apartments and a child-care center. 
But that's just a drop in the bucket, officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Orlando and other Branson entertainers have held fund-raisers to help 
remedy the housing shortage. And relief officials say they appreciate the boost 
Branson's thriving tourism industry has given to the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But Widmer said the stars and attractions that reap millions in tourist 
dollars must do more to relieve the desperate housing situation for the labor 
force -- starting with opening their pocketbooks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they have a moral responsibility to take care of the byproduct of 
their success," she said.

THE PARTY'S (ALMOST) OVER FOR NEW ORLEANS' CARNIVAL; MARDI GRAS: TOUGH ECONOMIC 
TIMES ARE FORCING CHANGE ON THE GLITZY EVENT. THIS YEAR, CORPORATE SPONSORS AND 
"OFFICIAL" PRODUCTS MAY HELP FINANCE THE EFFORT.

<P>
 Tough times are forcing change on the glitzy, mad carnival that is Mardi Gras. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, exclusive groups known as krewes made hosting the street party a 
point of civic pride. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, struggling to finance the gaudy parades and lavish balls expected to draw 
more than a million revelers to the city on Feb. 15, some may plug corporate 
sponsors on their parade floats. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've avoided it as long as possible. Now we're at the point of doing it or 
losing more parades. It's need, not greed," said one krewe captain, who 
according to tradition must remain anonymous until the group's ball. 
</P>
<P>
 And to pay for police and other services, the city is exploring a plan to 
license and sell "official" products during what has always been an extremely 
unofficial festival. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mardi Gras tradition dates back to 1827, when a band of exuberant Creoles 
just back from their studies in Paris donned fantastic costumes and startled 
the city with a street procession. 
</P>
<P>
 It has since become a huge tourist draw, generating $567.7 million in spending 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The spectacle builds toward Fat Tuesday, when parades wind into the city's 
French Quarter laden with celebrities and masked riders who fling trinkets into 
a forest of outstretched hands. 
</P>
<P>
 But all those toys and tinsel cost a pretty penny. 
</P>
<P>
 About 32,000 people rode in parades last year, spending an average of $440 
each for beads, stuffed animals, underwear, and other items to toss to the 
crowds, according to economist Jim McLain. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, krewe membership dues average $300, and although some krewes are 
raising them, they do so at their peril, said Arthur Hardy, publisher of the 
Mardi Gras Guide, an annual publication that describes floats and parade 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-thirds of the approximately 100 krewes traditionally raised revenue 
through bingo halls, but attendance and earnings dropped sharply when casinos 
opened on Mississippi's nearby Gulf Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, meanwhile, is considering defraying its costs with official 
T-shirts, gadgets and drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at every proposal that can help us make money and I take most of 
them," Mayor Sidney Barthelemy said. 
</P>
<P>
 An advisory committee of krewe captains rejected the city's proposal to market 
Mardis Gras, but others say the commercialization of Carnival is a foregone 
conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it can be done the right way, I think krewes will go along with it," Hardy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will always be Carnival. Right now, people are just waiting to see what 
it will be like."

DUTCH ZOO GOES APE OVER APE ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After they gaze at great works by Rembrandt and Van Gogh, art lovers can take 
in pieces by lesser known artists at the local zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 The big names in Dutch art may have spent hours of painstaking labor over 
their canvases, but most of the 30 pictures on display at the Artis Zoo took 
just seconds to execute. The exhibition is dedicated exclusively to ape art. 
</P>
<P>
 "They use pencils, charcoal and even water colors," zoo spokeswoman Henrietta 
Plantenga said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The primate pictures, some dating back to the 1950s, were created by 
orangutans and chimpanzees from all over Europe and collected by the 
Dutch-based Staring at Scribbles Foundation.

GUMBO POT OF CANDIDATES VIES FOR NEW ORLEANS MAYOR; POLITICS: WITH 10 
CONTENDERS IN THE RACE, A LITTLE CONTROVERSY IS BOUND TO SPICE THINGS UP. ONE 
LEADER'S AIDE IS INDICTED IN MUDSLINGING CASE.

 Ten candidates sought the city's top office Saturday, including the sons of 
two popular ex-mayors and a former port authority chairman whose adviser was 
indicted a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates were fighting to replace Mayor Sidney Barthelemy, who is barred 
from seeking a third four-year term. If no one receives a majority of the votes 
cast, a runoff for the top two vote-getters will be held on March 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls showed attorney Donald Mintz in a close race with state Sen. Marc 
Morial, son of the city's first black mayor, Dutch Morial. 
</P>
<P>
 Mintz's candidacy was damaged Friday when adviser Napoleon Moses was indicted 
for distributing anonymous, and therefore illegal, campaign literature. 
</P>
<P>
 The misdemeanor indictment did not specify which flyer Moses allegedly 
distributed. But several flyers smearing virtually all of the major candidates 
have surfaced around the city. 
</P>
<P>
 One flyer claimed that Morial, the acknowledged father of one child born out 
of wedlock, had fathered others. It also called him bisexual and a drug abuser. 
</P>
<P>
 State Rep. Mitch Landrieu, son of former Mayor Moon Landrieu, called for Mintz 
to withdraw from the race. Landrieu had been running a distant third in recent 
polls. 
</P>
<P>
 The race was an open primary, meaning members of any party could run. But 
eight of the 10 candidates ran as Democrats and the other two as independents, 
and party did not seem to matter as much as race. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's electorate is 62% black, and seven of the 10 candidates are black. 
Mintz, one of the three white candidates, lost four years ago to Barthelemy. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever is elected mayor will inherit recurring money woes and a 
$380-million-plus budget; the prospect of dealing with the world's largest 
gambling casino, expected to open in a year or two; and a burgeoning crime 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of just under a half-million people recorded 386 murders in 1993 -- a 
36% jump from the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 Barthelemy is backing City Councilman Lambert Bossiere, but his support may 
prove a liability. Barthelemy's popularity sank during his last term, and a 
report in the Times-Picayune newspaper charged that professionals with city 
contracts were pressured to help the Bossiere campaign. Barthelemy and Bossiere 
denied the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The other candidates are tax assessor Ken Carter, state Rep. Sherman Copelin, 
lawyer Roy Raspanti, Jerome Slade, Arthur Jacobs and Julius Leahman.

THERE'S TROUBLE IN RIVER CITY -- WITH A CAPITAL G; IOWA: STATE IS UNDER 
PRESSURE TO REMOVE LIMITS ON BETTING TO COMPETE WITH OTHER AREAS. FOES CALL IT 
IMMORAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD WALSH, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In his 1957 Broadway hit, "The Music Man," Meredith Willson captured some of 
the nostalgic flavor of his native state, portraying a land of gentle, 
good-hearted, if somewhat gullible, country folk who made easy targets for a 
traveling con man hawking high-school-band instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 That is part of the Iowa image, which made it all the more surprising when, in 
1989, the state seemed to turn its back on its folksy ways to follow the trail 
of glitz and easy money. 
</P>
<P>
 Iowa, of all places, became the first state outside Nevada and New Jersey to 
authorize full-scale casino gambling -- on riverboats on the Mississippi and 
Missouri rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Iowa hoped to avoid the high rollers who flock to Las Vegas and Atlantic 
City and hoped to make gambling here a wholesome, "family" diversion. 
</P>
<P>
 It imposed limits of no more than $5 per bet and a $200 total loss per person 
on any single riverboat cruise. No one would be allowed to lose the house or 
farm at a blackjack or roulette table in Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years after the floating casinos began operating on the rivers, this 
political compromise, which enabled the gambling law to squeak through the 
state legislature, is under assault, reviving a contentious debate over the 
extent to which Iowa should rely on gaming for revenue and as a tool to promote 
tourism and economic development. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with fierce competition from other states that have jumped into the 
gaming business without betting limits -- and Native American tribes that have 
opened unrestricted casinos on reservations here -- a coalition led by business 
interests is pushing for elimination of the limits and an easing of other 
restrictions on the riverboat operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition also has proposed that Iowa's four struggling dog- and 
horse-racing tracks be allowed to install slot machines to beef up revenues 
that have been diminished in part because of competition from the riverboats. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents of the expansion plan cry, "Enough is enough," and argue that 
once the current gambling fever, encouraged by revenue-hungry state 
governments, has swept across the country, Iowa will never be able to compete 
with more glamorous locales. 
</P>
<P>
 In an election year, the political sniping over the issue already has begun, 
much of it directed at Republican Gov. Terry E. Branstad. 
</P>
<P>
 Branstad does not approve of gambling, but critics note that during his three 
terms Iowa has plunged headlong into the gaming business -- first authorizing 
parimutuel betting, followed by a state lottery (which Branstad vetoed twice 
before signing) and finally the riverboats. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, in a lament that could have come from Willson's lyrics, Branstad 
acknowledged mishandling the gambling issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a country kid that grew up learning hard work, and I don't know much 
about gambling," he said. "It's probably true that I've not handled that very 
well. . . . I've tried to do my best, and I'm still learning." 
</P>
<P>
 In January Branstad called for elimination of the betting limits in the 
riverboat casinos but, citing the recommendation of a state task force, said 
more study is needed on whether to put slot machines at the racetracks. 
</P>
<P>
 Both those who favor adding slot machines at the tracks and those who oppose 
any expansion say Branstad's compromise is doomed in the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year legislators narrowly rejected a gambling-expansion bill, in part 
because of squabbling among the racetrack owners and between them and the 
riverboat interests. This year the pro-expansion forces have formed a united 
front. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Fred Grandy (R-Iowa), who is mounting an unexpected challenge to Branstad 
in the Republican gubernatorial primary, said the governor's plan is "a clear 
example of his indecisiveness." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you can't be a little bit pregnant on this issue," said Grandy, who 
advocates both putting slot machines at racetracks and eliminating casino 
betting limits. "You have to come down on the side of economic reality instead 
of moral repugnance." 
</P>
<P>
 Iowa Atty. Gen. Bonnie Campbell, who is seeking the Democratic gubernatorial 
nomination, supports slot machines for the racetracks and raising the 
per-cruise loss limit on the riverboats to $1,000, which she has been told 
"would basically solve the problem," said Phil Roeder, her campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Van Vooren, a lawyer and GOP activist in Davenport, is spearheading the 
effort to expand gambling here. Between July, 1992, and April, 1993, three Iowa 
riverboats left for more lucrative, unlimited markets in Mississippi and 
Missouri. Three remain, including The President at Davenport, but it is 
competing with a no-limit Illinois boat across the Mississippi at Rock Island. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Davenport, 1,000 jobs are in jeopardy because the Iowa statute is not 
competitive with the Illinois law," Van Vooren said. " . . . The limits must 
come off if Iowa is going to remain a factor in the gaming industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the opposition to expanded gambling is coming from religious groups. 
The Rev. Carlos Jayne, a United Methodist minister and lobbyist for a coalition 
of religious organizations, said opponents realize they cannot repeal existing 
gambling laws but are determined to halt further expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's actually an immoral thing for the state to be out promoting something 
and claiming it is nothing but recreation when it is in fact a very dangerous 
activity, like drinking and smoking," he said.

PRESCRIPTION FOR CHECKING OUT TROUBLED DOCTORS 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There are several ways for medical schools, hospitals and members of the 
public to find out about doctors in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Practitioner Data Bank, authorized by Congress in 1986, keeps 
information such as licensing actions against doctors and malpractice 
payments.It is available to hospitals, state licensing boards and professional 
societies conducting credential reviews -- but not the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The data bank has been operating since 1990 and doesn't include disciplinary 
actions before September of that year. But the Texas-based Federation of State 
Medical Boards has older records and maintains files on revocations or other 
disciplinary steps taken by 66 state medical boards for doctors and osteopaths. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency responded to 300,000 queries last year, including those from 
hospital credentialing committees, said Dr. James Winn, the federation's 
executive vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Winn said his agency has a thick file on Michael Swango that includes 
licensing actions taken against him in Illinois and Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that safeguards to prevent bad doctors from manipulating the system 
are adequate, but that the medical profession must be encouraged to use them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult for me to understand how a hospital would allow a physician to 
practice . . . and for them not to check out their credentials," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the data bank and federation assist only professionals, the Public 
Citizen's Health Research Group, founded by Ralph Nader, developed its own book 
of "10,289 Questionable Doctors" for the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The book includes doctors who have been disciplined by the federal government 
and state licensing boards, said Dr. Sidney Wolfe, the group's director. 
</P>
<P>
 For $15, citizens can buy books listing all "questionable" doctors in an 
individual state. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Ohio book, page 65 includes one doctor who has been in trouble. His 
name: Michael Swango.

campus from Downtown Los Angeles to La Mirada in the 1950s and was fondly 
remembered as "Mr. Biola," has died. He was 93. 
</P>
<P>
 Sutherland died Jan. 21 in his retirement home in Wheaton, Ill., university 
officials announced this week. 
</P>
<P>
 A memorial service is scheduled for Monday at 9:30 a.m. at Chase Gymnasium on 
the Biola campus in La Mirada. 
</P>
<P>
 A graduate of Occidental College and Princeton Theological Seminary, 
Sutherland began his career as pastor of Grace Presbyterian Church of Highland 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined the Bible Institute of Los Angeles Inc. in 1936 and became dean in 
1942 when the college had 400 students. Biola is an acronym for the institute, 
which was organized at the turn of the century to train Christian missionaries, 
ministers and music directors. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his university and civic duties, Sutherland helped found the 
American Assn. of Bible Colleges.

STAYING AFTER SCHOOL MAKES GRADE WITH EAGER LEARNERS; EDUCATION: SOME SCHOOLS 
STAY OPEN LATE, OFFERING HOMEWORK HELP AND RECREATION, SO THAT CHILDREN DON'T 
HAVE TO BE HOME ALONE OR ON THE STREETS. STUDENTS WHO PARTICIPATE USUALLY

 It's 3 p.m. and classes are over for the day, but fifth-grader Keisha Cox is 
settling down for several more hours at McKinley Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 With no one at home until evening, the school is her refuge. "There are people 
here to help you with your homework, and after you're done with your homework 
you can have a little fun," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assisted by social service organizations and private business, schools around 
the country are staying open into the evening -- some until 10 p.m. or later -- 
to give children a haven in dangerous surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Bill Bradley (D-N.J.) wants the federal government to get involved in the 
so-called community school concept. At his initiative, the crime bill passed by 
the Senate late last year includes $400 million over four years for community 
schools. The bill is awaiting action by a joint House-Senate conference 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, grants would be awarded to states based on the number of 
poor children living there. To be eligible, communities must demonstrate 
significant problems of poverty and juvenile delinquency. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley said keeping schools open is simply common sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Home in urban America in many cases is a war zone," he said before touring 
McKinley School in December. "If you've got a place that has books and want a 
place for kids to study and play a sport or talk to somebody about life, why 
not connect the two?" 
</P>
<P>
 There's support for Bradley's position in the Education Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "In many urban areas, the school is the only safe place to be," Deputy 
Education Secretary Madeleine Kunin said recently. "The longer you keep the 
schools open, the more lives you save." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's proposed reauthorization of the Elementary and 
Secondary Education Act would grant greater flexibility to use money for 
disadvantaged students. "It will allow people to use funds for extending school 
hours," Kunin said. 
</P>
<P>
 At McKinley, adjacent to two public housing projects, 125 children are 
registered for the community school program and 45 to 60 participate on any 
given day. The community school is fully financed by the city of New Brunswick; 
there is no charge to students. 
</P>
<P>
 If not for the program, "some children would be at home alone, some children 
would be literally out in the streets, some would be in child care centers," 
said David Blevins, the city's community school coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 The afternoon begins with an hour of homework help. Children then move to 
recreational activities such as dance, photography or open gym. 
</P>
<P>
 The program draws heavily on volunteers from nearby Rutgers University. Jon 
Dunham, a junior majoring in biology, is fulfilling a community service class 
requirement while at McKinley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't give them the answers," he said, as he moved around the room helping 
children with their homework. "You have to make them do the work." 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Joyce McGee said she can see a difference in the grades of the 
children in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Regina Sharpe, who oversees the McKinley community school, said changes extend 
beyond academics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see children with more confidence in themselves. I've seen some children 
mature," she said. "The children are learning that they can trust someone." 
</P>
<P>
 Boston has had community schools since 1974. "In the very beginning, they were 
started to make better use of school buildings, which sat empty after school 
and on weekends," said spokeswoman Sandy Holden. "Now, they offer a safe haven 
in the neighborhood and offer activities that kids can't get in other places." 
</P>
<P>
 Each of Boston's 38 community centers -- 20 are situated in schools -- is a 
separate nonprofit corporation. Each can set its own programming, although most 
have a mix of academic assistance and recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, community schools called Beacons were established in 1991 as 
havens for children and their families in neighborhoods hit the hardest by 
poverty, violence and substance abuse. The program has spread from 10 schools 
to 37.

IF FUGITIVES QUALIFY FOR WELFARE, THEN CRIME REALLY PAYS, CRITICS SAY; SOCIAL 
POLICY: THOSE ON THE LAM CAN LEGALLY COLLECT BENEFITS, AND PRIVACY LAWS LIMIT 
INFORMATION THAT CAN BE SHARED WITH POLICE. SOME LAWMAKERS CALL IT AN OUTRAGE. 
</P>

<P>
 Convicts who jump bail before sentencing or who violate parole or probation 
can legally collect welfare benefits while lying low. Under current welfare 
law, the government can't do a thing about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal welfare statutes do not exclude fugitives from public assistance. 
Privacy laws limit the exchange of information between police, who have 
hundreds of thousands of fugitive warrants on file, and welfare agencies, which 
have no way to know which of their clients are fugitives. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you meet the eligibility requirements, then you're eligible for 
assistance," said Joe Silver, a lawyer with the Ohio Department of Human 
Services. "If your benefits are terminated or your application is denied, it 
has to be because you didn't meet the criteria." 
</P>
<P>
 In Cleveland, Cuyahoga County sheriff's deputies were surprised to learn that 
at least 91 of 330 fugitives rounded up in a six-month sting last year were 
receiving welfare. The suspects were getting an average of $300 a month in 
benefits, Lt. Daniel Pukach said. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of Cleveland fugitives on welfare may actually have been higher; 
deputies didn't begin tracking the number until the third month of the sting, 
Pukach said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Department of Human Services had known where these people were living and 
was subsidizing their criminal activity at taxpayer expense," Pukach said. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the rising clamor for national welfare reform, word of this legal 
loophole raises hackles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's outrageous that we have a situation where . . . taxpayers are 
supporting someone who is a fugitive from justice," said Rep. Rick Santorum 
(R-Pa.), ranking Republican on the subcommittee that will consider President 
Clinton's expected welfare reform proposals this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can escape justice and the government will support you in doing so? And 
you have no fear of getting caught by getting access to government benefits? 
It's ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 No firm figures exist on the number of felons who are on the lam and on the 
dole. Silver says he's never seen a survey that tried to link the two. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because it's not an eligibility factor, it's not something that's really been 
looked at," Silver said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pukach, a 22-year veteran of the sheriff's department, said "easily a 
third" of the fugitives he arrests have identity cards from the county welfare 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just the other day we sent 80 cards over to the welfare department from 
people who had come through the jail," Pukach said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cards are turned over to the welfare department because it is illegal to 
receive welfare while jailed. Valid cards are returned to eligible recipients 
when they are released from jail or post bond. 
</P>
<P>
 But unless fugitives are caught -- and officers say many never are -- they can 
continue to collect benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 About 357,000 fugitive warrants, some of them dating back years, are on file 
at the National Crime Information Center, which gets its data from police 
jurisdictions around the country, spokesman John Kundts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuyahoga County alone has almost 13,000 outstanding warrants, and deputies can 
pursue only a fraction of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to prioritize who you can look for -- the suspected murderer or the 
probation violator on a grand-theft conviction," Pukach said. "A warrant is a 
warrant . . . but there really comes a point where you have to prioritize." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Cuyahoga County deputies tried to make a dent in the backlog. They 
picked 4,000 files and sent letters to last known addresses, informing 
recipients they were eligible to collect part of a settlement the state had won 
in a consumer fraud class-action lawsuit. Claimants were told where to pick up 
their checks. Those who showed were nabbed. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the sting's relative success, deputies were furious when county Human 
Services Director Joseph Garcia refused to allow them to match the warrants 
against welfare rolls. He said he had no choice: State and federal laws make 
much information about welfare recipients confidential. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government has three primary welfare programs: Aid to Families 
with Dependent Children, designed to meet the needs of children in families 
where one or both parents are missing or unemployed; Medicaid, which provides 
basic health coverage for the poor; and food stamps, coupons that can be spent 
like cash for staple foods. 
</P>
<P>
 State programs, such as General Assistance and Disability Assistance in Ohio, 
pay benefits to people who have no income or cannot work because of health 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 At the federal level, only AFDC rules permit any information exchange between 
law officers and welfare workers, said David Boomer, a spokesman for the 
Department of Health and Human Services in Washington. Confidentiality laws for 
state programs vary. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither federal nor state regulations disqualify fugitives from receiving 
welfare. And states can't exclude fugitives on their own because they may not 
impose stricter eligibility criteria than the federal government's, Silver 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Freedman, director of the Center for Social Welfare Policy and Law in 
New York City, a nonprofit advocacy organization, said no one should be denied 
such basic needs as food, clothing and shelter -- even if fleeing the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are things people need to survive," Freedman said. "By the same token, 
you wouldn't say emergency rooms should turn away people who are fugitives and 
in need of medical assistance." 
</P>
<P>
 Freedman acknowledges the problem but opposes adding language to welfare 
regulations to bar benefits to fugitives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever you add more hurdles to receiving aid," Freedman said, "you keep 
many needy individuals and families from getting the aid they need." 
</P>
<P>
 But Dennis Martin, a retired police chief in Maple Grove, Mich., and incoming 
executive director of the National Assn. of Chiefs of Police, said any system 
that subsidizes crime is out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have a system where it's difficult for agencies like the police and 
social services to work together . . . not only are criminals not paying the 
price for the crimes they've committed, but you're really hammering the 
taxpayer," Martin said. "It appears that crime really does pay."

EXERCISE CAN WARD OFF ILLS THAT COME WITH MENOPAUSE, MEDICAL JOURNAL REPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRA DREYFUSS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Menopause doesn't have to make a woman feel suddenly old. Exercise can help 
retain strength and vitality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Exercise decreases risk factors for coronary artery disease, decreases the 
risk of osteoporosis, strengthens pelvic structure and improves mood," said a 
report in The Physician and Sportsmedicine, a medical journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies find that taking up aerobic exercise can increase endurance, according 
to the article by Dr. Kathleen M. Hargarten of the Medical College of Wisconsin 
in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Diseases of the heart are a special concern to women at menopause because 
diminished estrogen production robs them of that hormone's apparent protective 
effect against cholesterol increases, the article said. 
</P>
<P>
 But exercise seems to increase production of high-density lipoproteins, which 
sweep away low-density lipoproteins, the cholesterol component that can lead to 
artery-clogging buildups of plaque. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are indications that even relatively low- to moderate-intensity 
exercise can produce significant increases in HDL cholesterol," Hargarten wrote 
in the January issue of the journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Her personal prescription leans toward moderation, calling for a minimum of 
three vigorous 20-minute aerobic exercise sessions per week. But some 
researchers have found that daily walking can improve HDL levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Reduction in estrogen can also lead to the brittle-bone disease known as 
osteoporosis. But exercise puts stress on bones, which stimulates them to 
become stronger, the article said. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrogen replacement is considered the best therapy against bone loss in 
post-menopausal women. But "recent evidence suggests that exercise also helps 
prevent and possibly reverse bone loss caused by aging," the article said. 
</P>
<P>
 This may be overstating the benefits, said Barbara L. Drinkwater, a researcher 
on osteoporosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Some women will think that exercise, combined with adequate calcium, the raw 
material of bone, will protect them -- but there's no evidence to support this, 
Drinkwater said. 
</P>
<P>
 Exercise can, however, prevent a bad thing from getting unnecessarily worse, 
said Drinkwater, a research physiologist at Pacific Medical Center in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would prevent the bone loss that would occur from being inactive," 
Drinkwater said. But the value of exercise alone "is not really very 
impressive," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no evidence that exercise can help a woman control hot flashes, the 
article said. But exercise can fight atrophy of the muscles and ligaments of 
the pelvis -- an important point, because atrophy can increase the risk of 
prolapse, Hargarten said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hargarten praises Kegel exercises -- tightening of the pelvic diaphragm 
muscles -- to fight these problems. Women should first learn how the muscles 
function by stopping urine midstream, she said. She recommends 25 Kegels twice 
a day, for up to 10 seconds per contraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Some studies have found that middle-age women who exercise regularly showed 
less anxiety and depression than did women who didn't exercise, the article 
said. Exercise can give a person a feeling of accomplishment, it said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Individuals who are capable of exercise can maintain their independence and 
sense of well-being, so the basic issue is quality of life," said Dr. Raul 
Ortal of the SUNY Upstate Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology in Syracuse, 
N.Y. This can lead indirectly to brighter moods, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To gain psychological benefits, women should decide what they want from 
exercise, what they enjoy and how exercise would best fit their schedule, 
Hargarten wrote.

BOTANIST FINDS RARE PLANT -- IN BACK YARD; MISSOURI: TOPSOIL DELIVERED TO HIS 
HOME SPROUTED TRIFOLIUM STOLONIFERUM, ALSO KNOWN AS RUNNING BUFFALO CLOVER, 
WHICH HAD ALL BUT VANISHED IN THE WILD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For someone who makes his living studying plants, George Yatskievych is an 
indifferent gardener. 
</P>
<P>
 It took the botanist several months to notice that a load of topsoil delivered 
to his home in St. Louis was sprouting several clusters of trifolium 
stoloniferum -- also known as running buffalo clover, a native plant that had 
all but vanished in Missouri. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was out weeding a flower bed near this topsoil, down on my knees, when I 
sort of came nose to nose with these things," said Yatskievych, who works at 
the Missouri Botanical Garden in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 "You spend all this time and effort looking for this in nature. . . . (The 
discovery) was so unexpected." 
</P>
<P>
 Yatskievych and other botanists took the six clovers found in his topsoil and 
began a project to reintroduce the plant to Missouri. Now, about five years 
after his discovery, the Missouri Department of Conservation oversees 700 
seedlings in 25 experimental plots statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 Yatskievych, who serves as an adviser to DOC botanists, says results have been 
mixed. Botanists need several years to learn what habitat the plant requires 
and whether it will be able to reproduce naturally, Yatskievych said. 
</P>
<P>
 The clover, which once ran wild from the eastern Great Plains to Pennsylvania 
and West Virginia, is protected by the federal Endangered Species Act. 
</P>
<P>
 "By clover standards, it's a very pretty plant," Yatskievych said. "It has 
larger flowers than the common weedy clover, and the plant itself is a very 
elegant plant." 
</P>
<P>
 Buffalo fed on the plant's long runners, and botanists think they helped 
propagate the plant in two ways, Yatskievych said: They trampled areas, wiping 
out the clover's natural competitors and giving it an open space to take root, 
and they spread the seeds through their droppings. 
</P>
<P>
 The decimation of the buffalo herds may be one reason the running buffalo 
clover declined, experts say. The last known geographic sample in Missouri was 
found in 1907. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years botanists have found "remnant populations" in West Virginia, 
Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky, Yatskievych said. 
</P>
<P>
 But botanists in Missouri still haven't found it occurring naturally despite 
intense field surveys in 1990, 1991 and 1992 after Yatskievych's back-yard 
discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 His topsoil was traced to an area along the Meramec River near St. Louis in 
Jefferson County, but Yatskievych and others have not found clovers at the 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know whether the seeds I got in my topsoil were washed downstream 
from some population that's still growing or whether they were buried some time 
ago and simply remained in the soil layer until they were exposed when the 
topsoil was moved," Yatskievych said. 
</P>
<P>
 Botanists know of other seed species that have survived in rodent holes for 
hundreds of years. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kansas, the last known sample of running buffalo clover was taken in Miami 
County in 1895, according to Ralph Brooks, a senior environmental scientist at 
a Kansas City engineering firm. He was one of 13 botanists from universities 
and colleges who collaborated on the book "Flora of the Great Plains," 
published in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as we know there are no living (buffalo clover) plants in Kansas," 
said Brooks, who at the time was assistant director of the University of Kansas 
herbarium. 
</P>
<P>
 Botanists in West Virginia have had more luck finding running buffalo clover 
in the wild, though it's still rare, said P. J. Harmon, a botanist for the 
state's Natural Heritage Program. 
</P>
<P>
 Yatskievych said the seedlings that came from the clovers in his topsoil are 
"quite precious" because they are the only genetic material for the clover from 
the state of Missouri. It will be unfortunate if they can't be coaxed into 
growing naturally, he said.

MASS TRANSIT, NOW MORE THAN EVER; THE QUAKE WAS A LESSON, BUT BETTER OPTIONS 
ARE NEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not even the worst earthquake in modern Los Angeles history was enough to 
break up the romance of solitary Southern California drivers and their 
automobiles. That was the finding, at least, of a recent Times poll in which 
86% of respondents in the Santa Clarita and San Fernando valleys said they do 
not plan to switch to mass transit or organize car or van pools. 
</P>
<P>
 The percentage of San Fernando Valley workers who had been using public 
transportation, for example, was quite small before the quake, ranging from a 
high of just 7.5% in the Mission Hills-Panorama City-North Hills area to a low 
of 1.3% in Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 This is unfortunate because success in coping with the Northridge quake 
depends on the use of more efficient transportation options. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena said as much when he emphasized 
that the long-term plan to rebuild the Los Angeles area's transportation 
network must include efforts to persuade as many commuters as possible to park 
their cars and use mass transit. To make such options more convenient, Pena was 
arranging to have more locomotives and trains added to Metrolink. He was also 
securing federal waivers to allow an increase in the average speed of Metrolink 
trains running between Palmdale and Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 As we have said before, if this disaster gets enough people out of their cars 
and riding to work by bus or rail, the quake may help put Los Angeles on its 
way to a more efficient and far less vulnerable 21st Century transit system. 
</P>
<P>
 We have repeatedly applauded, for example, the safety valve of the new rail 
options. Transportation officials, with the help of Navy Seabee crews, have 
done an admirable job of pressing new stations and alternatives into service in 
the Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys. Ridership, however, must resume its 
climb to alleviate the strain on congested roadways and broken highways. True, 
Metrolink ridership on some lines increased more than tenfold, but that says 
more about how few people were using the trains in the first place. And 
ridership took a disappointing dip last week -- by 40% in the Santa Clarita 
Valley -- which we hope represents only temporary testing of resumed commuting 
by car. 
</P>
<P>
 As more and more stations are rushed into service, we must also remind 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials and local governments that 
parking cannot be forgotten. It hardly helps to spark interest in the rails if 
drivers cannot find a parking spot. 
</P>
<P>
 In this regard, the San Fernando Valley Bus Restructuring Study takes on a 
heightened importance. Residents are unhappy with their bus options and the 
study was designed to take a comprehensive approach to the problem. Perhaps it 
will conclude that Valley residents would be better served by a point-to-point 
system in which the routes would connect major activity and employment centers, 
rather than the current grid system, which involves north-south and east-west 
routes and too many transfers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lastly, we are pleased to hear that MTA officials and Caltrans were working on 
adding high-occupancy vehicle or car-pool lanes to several freeways that serve 
the Valley before the quake. What better way to stress the advantages of ride 
sharing than the sight of car-pool traffic speeding past commuters during rush 
hour?

RETURNING TO SCHOOL ROUTINE IS CRUCIAL; PARENTS CAN HELP THEIR CHILDREN RECOVER 
FROM QUAKE BY GETTING THEM BACK ON TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even those San Fernando Valley parents who are not normally that involved in 
the life of their children's schools have had ample reason to be interested of 
late. They have had to inquire about the status of school buildings and 
campuses after the Northridge Quake, and have waited to hear about when those 
schools will resume operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Others are not so certain that the reopened structures are safe, and have held 
their children out of school. The latter is a mistake if the buildings have 
been inspected and declared sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important for a community that's had a major disaster to get back in to 
the daily rhythm of life as soon as possible," U.S. Education Secretary Richard 
Riley said after a recent visit to Kennedy High School in Granada Hills, 
"Schoolchildren in the schools is one of the most important parts of that 
rhythm." Translation: let the little loved ones back into that routine. It 
might be an important psychological and emotional boost. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents have a simple option for a little reinvestment in normalcy as well. 
They can ask for a copy of the Accountability Report Card on their children's 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandated by a 1988 state law and available since 1990, the report cards assess 
a school's academic performance, class sizes, teacher assignments, instruction, 
curriculum, teacher evaluations, attendance, dropout rates, and much more. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem? Most parents don't ask for them, or simply don't know what they 
are and that they are available. Unfortunately, the Los Angeles Unified School 
District simply can't afford to send out regular copies of the report cards, 
especially when so much of its resources have been devoted to getting schools 
in shape for classes again after the quake. And there is a related footnote to 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 LAUSD officials took on the task of reopening schools after the quake. Had the 
effort to break up the LAUSD succeeded, and had this been a Valley-only school 
system, it would have borne the brunt of the local repair costs. The fact that 
the LAUSD still exists means that the quake damage is a citywide problem, not 
just a Valley problem.

MASTERS OF MULTIMEDIA; TECHNOLOGY: FOR THE HANDFUL OF O.C. COMPANIES PRODUCING 
CD-ROM SOFTWARE, THE FUTURE HAS FINALLY ARRIVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chuck Cortright and Angela Aber were pioneers in multimedia before it became a 
buzzword. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were the idiots out there babbling about multimedia," said Aber, 
co-founder with Cortright of software company the Graphix Zone in Irvine. 
"People said, 'Multi-what?' Now it's in the paper every day." 
</P>
<P>
 After a long journey, multimedia -- a combination of video, animation, 
graphics, text and sound in a single computer program -- has arrived, thanks in 
large part to the CD-ROM: short for compact disc, read-only memory. In a 
typical computer store, the snazziest software is now running on computer and 
video game systems that use the CD-ROM, a cousin of the music CD. 
</P>
<P>
 The dazzling graphics and audio of CD-ROMs are available to anyone with a 
fairly new home computer and components that can cost less than $500. The discs 
themselves are sold everywhere from software stores to Wal-Mart for an average 
price of $42. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Graphix Zone and a handful of other Orange County software companies 
producing CD-ROMs, that means a chance to generate not only "oohs" and "aahs" 
but also dollars and jobs in deals with some of the biggest names in the 
entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
 In partnership with media giant Time Warner Inc., the Graphix Zone is 
producing an interactive music video featuring rock artist Prince. That 
program, not yet titled, will let fans listen to the singer in stereo, watch 
animation and view music videos. To be shipped on June 7, the star's birthday, 
it is the first in a series of rock music titles planned by the two companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The Graphix Zone and other local companies expect the new technology to give 
their revenue a huge boost. 
</P>
<P>
 "The CD-ROM is like manna from heaven for us," said Martin Alper, president of 
video game publisher Virgin Interactive Entertainment Inc. in Irvine. "There is 
a significant market today, and we expect exponential growth to take place in 
this sector." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mainstream acceptance of CD-ROM technology didn't happen overnight. Graphix 
Zone co-founders Cortright and Aber have dabbled in everything from cinematic 
production to computer training since they started the company in 1989 as a 
desktop publishing software reseller. But now that the company has focused on 
the development of CD-ROMs, its access to the information superhighway, which 
promises interactive TV with 500 channels, seems assured. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next three years will be very lucrative for people creating titles for 
CD-ROM," said Tim Bajarin, a computer consultant at Creative Strategies 
Research International in Santa Clara. "You can see it as a transitionary 
technology with a very long life." 
</P>
<P>
 The CD-ROM, like the music CD, uses a laser to read a pattern of bumps and 
troughs that are permanently engrained on a five-inch metal platter. Those 
patterns are basic digital data that can be understood by a computer. On music 
CDs, only sound is stored in the patterns. But CD-ROMs add pictures, words, 
video images and animation -- multimedia. 
</P>
<P>
 Personal computers equipped with information readers known as CD-ROM drives 
can scan the data stored on the discs, which can pack more than 600 times the 
amount of information on a typical floppy disk. 
</P>
<P>
 For enthusiasts, the difference between floppy disk video games and CD-ROMs is 
as great as that between silent films and modern motion pictures, said Johnny 
Wilson, editor of Computer Gaming World, an Anaheim Hills magazine that reviews 
computer games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long time coming, but the year of the CD-ROM is here," he said. 
"By 1995, all software games will be on CD-ROM." 
</P>
<P>
 Competing technologies, as well as personal computer owners' reluctance to 
abandon their floppy disks, kept CD-ROMs from taking off initially and could 
still forestall growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the CD-ROM was introduced in 1985, "the graphics quality . . . has been 
fairly primitive," said Raymond Boggs, analyst at market researcher BIS 
Strategic Decisions in Norwell, Mass. "But now it's like watching the first 
movie when it came out. People are excited." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The quality of CD-ROM animation has improved as home computers have gotten 
more powerful and technologists have learned how to pack more data into a small 
space. Falling prices have helped too: Typical double-speed drives now cost as 
low as $200, down from $1,000 two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The format also got a boost last year when Sega of America Inc. and a small 
Silicon Valley start-up firm called 3DO started shipping video game and 
entertainment systems that use CD-ROMs. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest factor, though, is that close to half of all personal computers 
sold in 1994 will feature CD-ROM drives, said Julie Schwerin, president of 
InfoTech, a market researcher in Woodstock, Vt.  
</P>
<P>
 "The CD-ROM industry is doubling every year, while the computer industry is 
growing 10% a year," she said. "In the 1980s, the manufacturers set these 
expectations that were too high. Some of the companies that dug in and waited 
are doing very well today." 
</P>
<P>
 Floppy disks still dominate software sales. The Software Publishers Assn. 
estimates that CD-ROMs accounted for only 2% of U.S. software revenue last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 But 2.6 million CD-ROM drives were sold last year, more than the total for 
1986 through 1991, InfoTech estimates. And 6.6 million home computers now have 
CD-ROM drives -- a good chunk of the estimated 40 million PCs in U.S. 
households. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of CD-ROM titles has also exploded. There are 7,183 in print now, 
up from 5,283 in 1992 and only 94 in 1986. Together, sales of CD-ROMs and 
drives are expected to be worth $7.7 billion this year -- equal to the total 
box office receipts of all U.S. movie theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Software companies are taking varied approaches to grab a piece of that 
action. Besides games, companies are putting reference books, encyclopedias, 
product catalogues, phone directories and other data on CD-ROMs. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinnacle Micro in Irvine sells kits that allow companies to create their own 
master copies of CD-ROMs. Service bureaus that also duplicate the discs have 
sprouted up to help entrepreneurs who want to create CD-ROMs. 
</P>
<P>
 Don and Toni Davis, a husband-and-wife team, created a CD-ROM company, CD Book 
Publishers, in their Fullerton home after Don lost his job in May, 1992. He 
publishes the text of federal regulations -- which on paper can be as much as 
10 feet thick -- on compact discs and sells them for $75 to $200. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Fullerton company, Takin' Care of Business, puts out a catalogue -- on 
interactive CD-ROM, of course -- of multimedia products. And Pixis Interactive 
in Tustin sells an adult CD-ROM title for people who want to play video strip 
poker with beautiful models. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine-based Rainbow Technologies Inc. has developed a system that allows 
customers to try out programs on CD-ROM at home without setting foot in a 
store. Purchases can then be made by telephone with a credit card. Rainbow has 
licensed the system to Apple Computer Inc. and other large computer makers. 
</P>
<P>
 Media Resources in Brea has an interactive multimedia storybook on CD-ROM, 
"T.J. Finds a Friend," that shows children how to avoid being kidnaped and how 
to recognize missing children. It was produced in cooperation with the National 
Center for Missing and Exploited Children. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Developing CD-ROM projects is neither simple nor cheap. Text, audio, video and 
animation must be coordinated seamlessly, and a sophisticated program such as 
an elaborate computer game can take 18 months and more than $1 million to 
complete. 
</P>
<P>
 But going to market with poor-quality programs known as "shovelware" will not 
generate either big revenue or pacts with high-tech giants, Graphix Zone's 
Cortright said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to be a pioneer to be a player," he said. "A big reason we got to work 
with Time Warner was that they saw the in-house experience and industry 
contacts that we had." 
</P>
<P>
 His company's 30 employees labored for six months to produce the Prince 
CD-ROM, which includes the star's latest songs, glittery 3-D animation and 
video. 
</P>
<P>
 The company expects to work with other artists on the new genre, which is 
neither video game nor music CD. Because the programs are interactive, the user 
can explore them for hours, jumping back and forth from the videos to 
animations or just listening to the songs. 
</P>
<P>
 Such intense projects create positions for graphic artists, illustrators, 
programmers, animators, musicians and video experts. But despite openings and 
an abundance of resumes, Cortright said, hiring goes slowly because "it's hard 
to find experienced people." 
</P>
<P>
 Practical knowledge, rather than formal education, usually determines who gets 
the job. Sean Dunn, 25, who is integrating the parts of the Prince CD-ROM into 
a single multimedia presentation, has been at the Graphix Zone since he 
graduated two years ago from the University of Redlands. He studied multimedia 
computer skills in his senior year but learned how to put together projects by 
doing custom designs for Graphix Zone clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were only beginning to teach this in school when I graduated," Dunn 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the technology is so new, those in the business often learn it by 
banding together and sharing their knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis of CD Book Publishers leads a group for the North Orange County Computer 
Club. Its monthly meeting at Chapman University in Orange draws 30 to 50 people 
who exchange information about the finer points of "romming." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a revolution," Davis said, "and we're making it happen."

A NEW WASHINGTON AWAITS HOSOKAWA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KARL SCHOENBERGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa arrives here for Friday's 
summit with President Clinton, he is likely to find that the red carpet 
welcoming him has a very different hue than the one rolled out for his 
predecessors during the good old days of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 The pomp and protocol will not be all that different, but the diplomatic 
overtones will. Hosokawa and his entourage of handlers from Japan's powerful 
economic bureaucracies will find that the rules of engagement have changed in 
the long simmering dispute over U.S.-Japan trade relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Strategic allies or not, Americans are obsessed with their own "economic 
security" now, and they are redefining the linkage between trade and 
geopolitical security. 
</P>
<P>
 The shift in priorities is subtle and still largely beneath the surface of 
open policy pronouncements. But early warning signs portend a new mode of 
confrontation with powerful ramifications for the way the world will look in a 
decade or so, during the so-called Pacific Century. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer, in the post-Cold War era, does the threat of Soviet expansionism -- 
or even North Korea's nuclear brinkmanship -- demand that America paper over 
its nettlesome trade disputes with Japan, the old bulwark against communist 
domino-tumbling in East Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States is no longer faced with the absolute need to trade off 
economic interests for security interests," said W. Bowman Cutter, deputy 
director of the president's National Economic Council and a key White House 
strategist on Asian affairs. "We have more discretion now." 
</P>
<P>
 At stake is not just tension in ties with Tokyo. The old China card, long held 
up America's sleeve in the showdown with Moscow, is all but forgotten now in an 
escalating clash between Beijing and Washington over trade and human rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone, too, is a benign tolerance for developing Asian nations' tendency to 
emulate Japan's brand of capitalism. 
</P>
<P>
 That model of mercantilist state guidance, many critics contend, has allowed 
booming Asian economies to prosper on exports while protecting home marketsand 
to take advantage of an open U.S. market while enjoying the benefits of an 
unconditional security umbrella. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton articulated the evolving attitude on trade and security linkage when 
he complained about market barriers in a speech to the Asia Pacific Economic 
Cooperation (APEC) forum in Seattle in November: 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not intend to bear the cost of our military presence in Asia and the 
burdens of regional leadership only to be shut out of the benefits of growth 
that stability brings," the President said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is open to interpretation whether his remark was intended as a veiled 
threat of military withdrawal -- a kind of reverse saber rattling -- or a 
simple plea for voluntary economic reciprocity.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the President's message was perhaps intentionally vague. 
</P>
<P>
 No one has forgotten the blunder Jimmy Carter made in the late 1970s, when he 
threatened to withdraw U.S. troops from South Korea to push his human rights 
agenda. Carter's gesture emboldened the volatile Communist regime in North 
Korea, which the CIA believes now has a nuclear warhead or two in its arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really are out there to defend American interests," said a Pentagon 
official knowledgeable about Asia. "I don't see us saying that if we don't 
resolve trade barriers we're pulling out. That's shooting ourselves in the 
foot." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the U.S.-Japan security alliance -- for more than four decades the 
cornerstone of America's estimated $9 billion-a-year engagement in Asia -- may 
come under mounting pressure if the public perception of economic unfairness 
grows, analysts warn. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that bad economic relations with Japan are souring the rest of 
our relationship," said Joan Spero, the State Department's undersecretary for 
economic affairs. "We can't continue to justify to the American people that we 
maintain these costly commitments without benefiting from the economic peace." 
</P>
<P>
 It remains unclear whether Hosokawa can bring to Washington a significant 
package of results-oriented trade concessions, as the Americans demand. More 
likely, analysts predict, he will ask Clinton to take the heat off and help him 
keep his fragile, change-minded coalition in power. 
</P>
<P>
 But if tough-talking trade officials in the Administration prevail, the summit 
could become a benchmark in an unforgiving U.S. trade policy -- never mind the 
political consequences for the reformist Prime Minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the heat is rising in trade with Japan very soon after the 
Administration's triumphal "triple play" in global trade initiatives late last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, Clinton pushed the North American Free Trade Agreement through 
Congress. Then he hosted the much ballyhooed summit of Asian leaders in 
Seattle, setting a tentative course for regional economic cooperation. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, cliffhanger negotiations gave a new lease on life to the global 
framework for free-market trade -- the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.  
</P>
<P>
 But the new GATT agreement does not offer remedies for the most vexing 
problems of market access to Japan and other Asian economies, from South Korea 
to Indonesia, U.S. officials and trade analysts contend. Rather than erecting 
high tariff walls and quotas, these economies protect themselves with informal 
barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 That, supposedly, is why Japan -- despite its ascendance as the world's 
largest creditor nation -- is surprisingly insular when it comes to foreign 
participation in its domestic economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreigners own less than 1% of all corporate assets in Japan and account for 
only slightly more than 1% of total sales there. In contrast, Japanese 
interests alone control nearly 5% of corporate America and account for nearly 
17% of all U.S. sales, according to a recent study by David L. Asher, an 
analyst with the House Wednesday Group, a congressional forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Asher's study, based on Japanese government statistics, finds that foreign 
penetration of the Japanese market is actually somewhat smaller today than it 
was 30 years ago, when Tokyo joined the Organization for Economic Cooperation 
and Development -- where it remains an anomaly in terms of the scant foreign 
presence in its home markets. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Seiichiro Noboru, economic minister at the Japanese Embassy, decries the 
proliferation in official Washington of this type of negative analysis of 
Japan, which he dismisses as "revisionism." 
</P>
<P>
 Noboru, who will become consul general in Los Angeles later this month, 
recalled with chagrin an incident that illustrated the new American audacity 
during trade talks in Tokyo late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 A high-level U.S. negotiator, apparently frustrated by the lack of progress in 
the talks, denounced Japan as an "outlier" among advanced industrial nations. 
Noboru and his colleagues saw the remark as an insult, labeling Japan an 
international pariah, akin to Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 "We understood the idea was that Japan is so different from other countries 
that if you don't target it with sanctions, it won't move an inch," Noboru 
said. "That idea hurts the (Japanese) people." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the Clinton Administration appears to have been influenced widely by 
so-called revisionist critics of the Tokyo government who assert Japan is 
hardly the champion of free-market economics it professes to be -- and 
therefore must be treated differently than, say, Britain or Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen echoed this view as he ended his visit to 
Tokyo last month, branding Japan as "out of step." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an untenable situation," said Robert E. Rubin, head of the National 
Economic Council and the Administration's principal coordinator for domestic 
and international economic policies. "In the long run, you are not going to 
solve U.S. trade deficit problems unless you have access to these markets." 
</P>
<P>
 The fundamental problem is Japan's "broadly held mercantilist perspective," 
Rubin added. "For whatever the reason, they have deeply embedded ways of doing 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 The major bone of contention is Japan's trade surplus with the United States, 
which has risen inexorably from $17 billion in 1982 to $50 billion in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 The trade gap is expected to hit a record $59 billion , when last year's 
figures are compiled -- despite a jump in the value of the yen that 
theoretically should make Japan's products more expensive and less competitive 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Automobiles and auto parts alone account for some three-quarters of the 
bilateral imbalance, which is why U.S. negotiators are seeking to pry open 
markets for foreign automotive products. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But if there is a focus in the current round of U.S.-Japan "framework" 
negotiations, it is the question of "objective criteria." The issue: How can 
both sides agree to measure improved market access and monitor progress in 
bringing down Japan's stubborn trade surplus? 
</P>
<P>
 From this point, the framework talks take on the ethereal quality of a 
theological debate. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. side is asking Tokyo's influential bureaucrats to use their powers of 
informal "administrative guidance" to coerce the private sector into importing 
more American goods. Japanese officials say that is impossible, arguing they no 
longer have the "government reach" to manipulate imports in the same way they 
planned and guided Japan's export machine in years past. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese side takes the moral high groundat least in the eyes of its own 
publicby rejecting American demands for market access as "managed trade" that 
violates the spirit of GATT. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, this abstract exchange comes down to earth with the bogyman of 
economic sanctionsand the question of whether the Clinton Administration is 
posturing or really intends to strike out to enforce its point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese negotiators have categorically rejected the use of "unilateral 
actions" -- a euphemism for sanctions -- and vowed to suspend talks if things 
come to blows. The U.S. has refused to assuage Japanese nerves by ruling out 
the use of sanctions if the talks fail, or if trade promises are not kept. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to disarm," said Spero, the State Department official. "I 
think the Japanese are very concerned about that." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the idea of imposing sanctions under existing trade lawsnamely Section 
301, a provision that empowers the President to assign punitive tariffsis a 
subject of great controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 It is debatable whether such a bludgeon would effectively break down the 
entrenched mind-set that obstructs market access to Japan -- or merely 
reinforce it. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, sanctions could hurt American business interests at home, where 
Japanese companies are tied deeply into the economy. (Japan held $96.7 billion 
in cumulative U.S. direct investment -- from auto plants to office towers to 
bank portfolios -- at the end of 1992, putting it ahead of Britain as the 
largest investor nation.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Five years ago, it was easy to retaliate. But today, because of economic 
integration and strategic business alliances, a lot of U.S. interests are going 
to be hurt," said William T. Archey, senior vice president at the U.S. Chamber 
of Commerce. "And they'll be in the front of the line to complain." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond tariff sanctions, few forms of leverage are available. Pundits discuss 
downgrading airline landing rights, denying privileges to bid on federal public 
works projects or prosecuting Japanese multinationals under tax and antitrust 
laws. But such tit-for-tat retribution smacks of protectionism, and risks 
igniting a trade war. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the final analysis, is the new breed of trade warriors in the Clinton 
Administration merely bluffing -- pretending to play hardball, but without a 
real bat? 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, said Rubin, the White House economic field marshal. 
</P>
<P>
 This time things are really different, he said. There will be no backing away 
to protect a friendly prime minister in a jam, no soft peddling because the 
Japanese economy is in a slump. 
</P>
<P>
 "This trade situation has gone on for well over a decade," Rubin said. "Each 
time we try to deal with it, there's another reason not to deal with it. We 
need to be sensitive to their political problems, but we also need to get 
things done." The Clinton-Hosokawa Summit 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa arrives in Washington on Friday for 
a summit meeting with President Clinton. Here are the agendas that each leader 
is expected to bring to the negotiating table: 
</P>
<P>
 What Clinton will be telling Hosokawa: 
</P>
<P>
 * There must be objective criteria to measure improvements in market access 
for a variety of foreign products and services, especially in the automotive 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quantitative targets are necessary to assure the reduction of Japan's 
massive bilateral and global trade surpluses. 
</P>
<P>
 * A significant package of income tax cuts and public works spending is needed 
to boost Japan's domestic economy and promote imports. 
</P>
<P>
 What Hosokawa will be telling Clinton: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Japanese government does not have the "administrative reach" to force 
the private sector to import more foreign products. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quantitative targets are tantamount to "managed trade," which violates the 
spirit of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and makes Japan vulnerable 
to punitive sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Japan, doing its "utmost" in an unstable political environment, is still 
considering a $130-billion domestic stimulation package, even after Hosokawa's 
$49-billion proposal had to be abandoned.

JAMES FLANIGAN: IN BIG-TIME HEALTH CARE, ROOM FOR COMPROMISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Big business last week opposed President Clinton's health care reform plan 
because it would use government price controls and regulations to reduce 
medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Small business is extremely suspicious of the Clinton plan because it would 
impose mandates on all employers, including store owners with a few helpers, to 
provide health insurance for their employees and pay 80% of its cost. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Clinton plan, drawn up under the leadership of First Lady Hillary 
Rodham Clinton, would determine total U.S. medical costs, region by region, 
through limits set by a National Health Board appointed by the President. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there a time warp here? Are the Clintons and their health care planners 
characters left over from a Soviet Politburo? Not really, although the Clintons 
believe in state power to regulate health care reform much more than does the 
business community. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Clintons also recognize something that the business community doesn't 
talk about: That medical care in America, in going from a cottage industry of 
doctors' offices and small and large hospitals to a business in which only big 
organizations can play, is becoming an oligopoly. That's a big economic word 
that Webster defines as "control of a commodity or service in a given market by 
a small number of companies or suppliers." 
</P>
<P>
 That's a trend to be watched but it's also inevitable. To handle more patients 
and deliver care under tighter cost guidelines, hospitals and medical practices 
and health maintenance organizations have been merging for years.  
</P>
<P>
 And the trend to bigness will continue whether the Clinton plan or an 
alternative proposed by Representatives Jim Cooper (D.-Tenn.) and Fred Grandy 
(R.-Iowa) or some combination of both becomes law. 
</P>
<P>
 In the present controversy we need to see where the Administration is on the 
right track and where it isn't, and what intelligent compromise would bring 
truly beneficial health reform when the issue nears a vote in Congress in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 First, let's look at the health business, which is quite profitable these 
days. Insurance companies such as Prudential -- whose chairman, Robert Winters, 
wrote last week's Business Roundtable opposition to the Clinton plan -- Aetna, 
Cigna and others, are doing very well. Health insurance profits in some cases 
are up 80%. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is insurers are passing on the risk to health care providers and to 
the patients. That's what happens every time the insurer tells a doctor it will 
cover only so much surgery, or tells the patient it won't cover a certain 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The business has shifted to managing risk rather than underwriting medicine on 
demand as used to be the case. 
</P>
<P>
 But premiums haven't come down appreciably, and the Clinton Administration 
sees markets being distorted. So it threatens to limit premiums. The 
Administration also talks of regulating drug prices, believing that controls 
will hold down prescription costs. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the real effect would be to make medicine a utility like electricity, 
gas and local telephone service. "If you set prices in an industry, then you 
have to allow rate of return on investment and also eliminate competition," 
notes Viren Mehta of Mehta & Isaly, a New York investment firm that specializes 
in the pharmaceutical field. "Utilities don't often lower costs," he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Big companies, already lowering their own costs by making employees shoulder 
higher co-payments on care, don't want to see a medical utility system, and 
they're right. Innovation and unforeseen competition are much better than 
regulation at keeping oligopolies in line -- witness what MCI did to the old 
AT&T, or international competition did to the U.S. auto industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Changes will come about as large organizations in the health market compete 
for patients, and technology and individual preferences come into play -- 
Americans of Asian descent will seek out different types of physicians than 
Hispanic Americans," says Dr. Schumarry H. Chao, a Los Angeles physician who is 
now a consultant to business.  
</P>
<P>
 Small business fears are different, and less justified in some cases. Today 
98% of companies with more than 100 employees provide health coverage, and more 
than 70% of companies with more than 10 employees offer coverage -- although 
not all pay for it. However, among the 3.5 million smallest firms -- offices, 
workshops and stores -- 73% do not offer coverage for their employees. They 
face a hit. 
</P>
<P>
 But since there is no free medical care, we might ask who has been paying for 
their employees -- who make up almost half of the 37 million uninsured 
Americans? The answer goes to the heart of the crisis in U.S. medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 Treatment for uninsured patients is paid for by shifting costs to the fully 
insured, typically 20% more on hospital bills, say medical experts such as 
Kenia Casarreal, a Los Angeles consultant who has worked with hospitals and 
large corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the uninsured go to emergency rooms for ordinary care, where the bill -- 
paid for by taxpayers or fully-insured patients -- might be $500 to treat a 
child's stomach ache. 
</P>
<P>
 Those excesses would be eliminated if all Americans were brought under health 
insurance, so the cost of universal coverage would not be that large. By some 
estimates, total U.S. medical costs would rise by less than $50 billion in 1994 
if universal health coverage were put in effect today. 
</P>
<P>
 That's only a 5% increase in the country's $900-billion annual health care 
bill. And long-term savings could follow from a healthier population as all 
Americans enjoyed a basic level of care. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Clintons are right to demand that small business offer insurance to 
employees. The argument is over who pays and how much -- the boss or the 
workers. It's an argument colored by unhelpful attitudes. Hillary Clinton's 
widely quoted remark in testimony last year that "I can't be expected to save 
every undercapitalized entrepreneur" reflected the disdain of a Washington 
elite toward ordinary business people. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the small business owners' stance that their employees' health care should 
be financed by big business and taxpayers doesn't make sense either. 
</P>
<P>
 An intelligent compromise would be for employers and employees to negotiate 
how they'll split health premiums, with protection and public subsidy for the 
poorest workers. 
</P>
<P>
 That way individual good sense could come into play. Ultimately, if we 
acknowledge that neither government nor business has all the answers or the 
virtue, the country might get a better-financed health care system.

EXPORTS IN OVERDRIVE; SUDDENLY U.S. AUTO SALES SURGE OVERSEAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD W. NAUSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Boxy Jeep Cherokees built by Chrysler in Toledo -- Ohio, that is -- zip down 
Germany's autobahns from Bonn to Berlin. Right-hand-drive Ford Probes made in 
Flat Rock, Mich., draw stares on London streets. And wide-bodied Chevrolet 
Caprice sedans, assembled in Texas, are status symbols in Saudi Arabia. 
</P>
<P>
 Once shunned as shoddy, shameless models of excess, U.S. vehicles now carry a 
certain cache internationally. The surprising result is that the Big Three auto 
makers quietly have become a significant exporting force. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, Chrysler, Ford and General Motors exported nearly 350,000 vehicles 
from North American plants last year. That was up 18% from 1992 -- and a more 
than fourfold increase from 1986 levels. Exports easily could double again in 
the next five years, industry officials estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 While nowhere near the same league as Japan -- which exported 5 million cars 
last year, including 1.6 million to the United States -- the Big Three are 
showing that their newest products have global appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're selling more cars and trucks in a tougher global market because we're 
building better products," said Andrew Card, president of the American 
Automobile Manufacturers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 That's hardly the only reason for the export boom. 
</P>
<P>
 North America has become an efficient, low-cost manufacturing center. The weak 
dollar makes U.S. products cheaper abroad. Trade barriers are coming down. The 
telecommunications revolution is resulting in a growing convergence of consumer 
tastes worldwide. And Detroit companies are headed by a new generation of 
leaders with international experience and global vision. 
</P>
<P>
 These forces have resulted in some profound changes in the North American 
vehicle market. 
</P>
<P>
 The Big Three themselves were net vehicle importers through the 1980s and 
early '90s. Detroit sold as many as 400,000 Japanese-made vehicles under U.S. 
nameplates. That reversed in 1992. Last year, GM, Ford and Chrysler exported 
twice as many vehicles as they imported. 
</P>
<P>
 With the construction by Japanese car makers of U.S. assembly plants in recent 
years, total U.S. imports dropped from 4.6 million vehicles in 1986 to 2.2 
million last year. The Japanese, too, are exporting vehicles from the United 
States. Together, Honda, Nissan and Toyota exported 93,700 vehicles from U.S. 
plants last year, mostly to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 With a strong yen, Japanese production in the United States is expected to 
continue growing. So will the Japanese makers' U.S. exports. And German auto 
makers also are gearing up U.S. production to take advantage of lower operating 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, BMW begins production in South Carolina of its 3-Series sedan. 
Operating costs will be a third less at its Greer, S.C., plant than in Germany. 
Mercedes-Benz is building a plant in Alabama, with plans to export half the 
sport-utility vehicles built there to Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of their total sales, Big Three exports are still quite small. The 
U.S. industry sold 13.9 million cars and trucks last year. Exports amounted to 
only about 2.5% of the total. 
</P>
<P>
 But the export growth came in the face of severely depressed markets in Europe 
and Japan. And looking forward, exports could provide an important hedge 
against an economic downturn in the United States, analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there clearly are limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Both GM and Ford have extensive global manufacturing operations. Neither wants 
to compete for sales with their own foreign units. Instead, their focus is on 
finding underserved niches, such as the minivan or sport-utility markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Market differences also may hamper exports. Because of lower gas prices in 
America, the Big Three's vehicles tend to be bigger and less fuel efficient 
than the popular-selling cars in Europe, Japan and Latin America.  
</P>
<P>
 "America is not going to be a great exporter of vehicles," said Ford Vice 
Chairman Allan Gilmour.  
</P>
<P>
 But such thinking is no longer universal. Another school of thought holds that 
market differences are narrowing because of rapid changes in the global flow of 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're finding that as the world gets smaller and smaller through mass 
communications and transportation technology, automobile markets worldwide are 
becoming more and more similar," said Thomas Gale, vice president of design and 
international operations for Chrysler. 
</P>
<P>
 If that's correct, well-built, well-designed U.S. vehicles may have appeal in 
other countries with only minimal modifications. 
</P>
<P>
 As a case in point, consider Chrysler's minivans and sport-utility vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 With only minor changes from its U.S. cousin, the Voyager/Caravan minivan is 
finding eager buyers in Europe. Likewise, the Jeep Cherokee and upscale Grand 
Cherokee are in demand in Germany, Taiwan and Argentina. Chrysler also is 
producing right-hand-drive Cherokees for Japan, Great Britain and Australia at 
its plant in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, the company exported 132,000 vehicles last year, up 26% from 1992. 
The sales abroad were more cars than Volkswagen, Volvo, BMW, Mercedes, Audi, 
Isuzu, Subaru and Hyundai sold, individually, in America during the same 12 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for the export successes is that Detroit has learned a lot from 
these competitors and others. The Big Three have adapted Japanese production 
techniques to become more efficient and measured their cars against their 
rivals' best to improve quality. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Big Three still trail the Japanese in quality surveys, the gap in 
defects has narrowed. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, some say the differences are negligible. 
</P>
<P>
 "All three domestic manufacturers are better than the Japanese were when they 
established their reputation for bullet-proof quality," said Chrysler President 
Robert Lutz. "The rankings distort reality." 
</P>
<P>
 Chrysler may be emerging as the world's most efficient and profitable car 
company. Many analysts say much of the reason is that it used Honda as a model 
for its corporate face-lift. 
</P>
<P>
 And Ford and GM, too, are using their ties to Japanese competitors to help 
boost exports. The sporty Probe, for example, was designed with Mazda's 
assistance; Probes roll off the line right behind Mazda 626s and MX-6s at the 
companies' joint Auto Alliance International assembly plant in Flat Rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Ford shipped 11,000 Probes abroad, mostly to Europe. Exports should 
grow now that the plant has been expanded and modified to build 
right-hand-drive Probes. The first such models, destined for Great Britain, 
were driven off the line in December. The cars eventually will be sold in Japan 
and Australia, as well. Ford, with total exports of 71,000 vehicles last year, 
also is planning right-hand-drive versions of its Explorer and Taurus for sale 
in Japan later in the decade. The redesigned 1994 Mustang will go on sale in 
Japan in mid-May. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a shot at exporting 100,000 (vehicles) next year," said Alexander 
Trotman, Ford's chairman and chief executive. "Our aspiration is to go for 
250,000 by 1998." 
</P>
<P>
 GM also is seeking to bolster its exports from last year's 139,000 cars and 
trucks. It recently signed an agreement with Toyota for the sale of 20,000 
right-hand-drive Chevrolet Cavaliers in Japan. The cars will be built in 
Lordstown, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 But GM's most aggressive export move is production of a minivan at its 
Doraville, Ga., plant for sale in Europe under its Opel badge. Up to 30% of the 
plant's output may be dedicated to vehicles for sale abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts attribute the Big Three's newfound interest in exporting to the 
new leaders who have assumed the top operating posts in the last 15 months. 
John F. Smith, GM's chief executive officer, established his reputation as head 
of GM's European and international operations. Trotman ran Ford of Europe. And 
Chrysler's CEO, Robert Eaton, was recruited from GM-Europe. They all have a 
broad understanding of global competition and consumer demands in different 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because they have international experience, they bring a totally new 
personality to the American auto companies," said Maryann Keller, analyst with 
Furman Selz, a New York brokerage. "It makes them more flexible." 
</P>
<P>
 Flexible, perhaps, but still tough -- particularly when it comes to Japan. The 
main reason is the stubborn U.S. trade deficit, estimated at a record $59 
billion for 1993. Sixty percent of the imbalance is related to autos and auto 
parts. 
</P>
<P>
 So even as the Big Three have rebounded, they have pressed their fair-trade 
case against Japan with renewed vigor. Detroit notes that while exports are up 
strongly, the gains have little to do with Japan, where U.S. car makers sold 
just 17,093 North American-built vehicles last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The auto makers say it is nearly impossible to sell cars in Japan because of 
difficult certification rules and lack of access to dealer networks. The 
Japanese argue that U.S. auto makers have not built cars for the Japanese 
market and that product quality is poor. 
</P>
<P>
 In the current "framework trade talks" between the two countries, the 
Administration wants Japan to accept numerical targets for vehicle sales and 
auto parts purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 But such quotas are difficult for Japan to swallow. Its market has been 
shrinking for three years, and it is under pressure to limit exports to Europe. 
More competition at home from Detroit could only hurt Japanese manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the Big Three last month dispatched Card, their chief lobbyist and 
former U.S. transportation secretary, to take Detroit's case to the Japanese 
consumer. His message: The average Japanese is paying higher prices because GM, 
Ford and Chrysler are being kept out. 
</P>
<P>
 "American auto makers and Japanese consumers will both benefit," Card 
preached, "from the same open access to Japan's market that Japanese auto 
makers have enjoyed in the United States for decades." Big Three Exports Are 
Booming... 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond recent gains, industry officials estimate that exports will at least 
double in the next five years. 04,17,14,14,16 Auto maker 1992 exports 1993 
exports Percent change Chrysler* 104,723 132,123 +26% Ford 50,090 70,999 +42% 
General Motors* 134,506 139,435 +6% Total 289,319 342,557 +18% *Includes sales 
of knock-down kits for assembly of vehicles abroad and sales to U.S. military 
personnel overseas. ... but Japanese Exports From the U.S. Are Flat 
</P>
<P>
 Exports from Japanese plants in the United States dipped in 1993, largely due 
to a drop in exports of Honda Accords because of a model changeover. Honda 
expects to export 75,000 vehicles this year. 04,17,14,14,16 Auto maker 1992 
exports 1993 exports Percent change Honda 55,850 41,694 -25% Nissan* 829 3,457

exports of new Altima sedan. Still, Japan Remains Wary of U.S.-Made Cars 
</P>
<P>
 Only a small percentage of Japanese consumers say they would be willing to 
purchase a car manufactured by the Big Three. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't want to purchase at all: 68% Definitely want to purchase: 2% May 
purchase: 9% Not likely to purchase: 21% 
</P>
<P>
 And Japanese car dealers say the Big Three need to improve almost every part 
of their operations if they hope to boost sales in Japan, including: Parts 
supply system: Percent of import-brand dealers citing need to improve: 46.8% 
Percent of Japanese-brand dealers citing need to improve: 78.8

TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS: CLINTON DEFENSE CUTS DEAL CALIFORNIA ECONOMY ITS 
GREATEST JOLT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL J. BOSKIN, MICHAEL J. BOSKIN, former chairman of the President's 
Council of Economic Advisers, is Tully M. Friedman professor of economics and 
senior fellow, Hoover Institution, at Stanford University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern Californians, like Job, are being tested by a remarkable string of 
disasters: drought, fires, riots, earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of all the devastation, the media focused on President Clinton 
seizing the opportunity to come out and show how much he is helping California. 
After all, the President and the Vice President show up in California almost as 
frequently as Ronald Reagan did when he was President -- and he was a 
Californian. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is determined not to fall prey to the charge of disinterest in 
domestic matters economic that plagued President Bush, and polls so far show 
California has responded positively to his attention. 
</P>
<P>
 But eventually, Clinton will have to confront a harsh reality: His budget 
policy -- the tax increases, but even more the enormous defense cuts -- is 
inflicting much more harm on California's economy than the sum of all his 
efforts to help the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the numbers: When Administration officials talk of Clinton's 
five-year plan for California, they suggest spending several hundred million 
dollars -- not counting the recent proposal for quake recovery. But this 
amounts to less than a penny on the dollar compared to the annual amount of 
income -- and with it employment--that Clinton's defense drawdown is sucking 
out of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the President's defense plans are the economic equivalent of the "Big 
One" -- the hypothetical gigantic quake on the San Andreas Fault. A more 
prudent defense drawdown would be 100 times more favorable to the California 
economy than the sum of everything else Clinton is doing or proposing. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, some defense drawdown and reprioritization was in order following the 
end of the Cold War. Defense spending was 5.1% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) 
in 1980. The Reagan buildup peaked in 1986, at about 6.5% of GDP, and a sizable 
drawdown was begun under Presidents Reagan and Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 But we are heading into uncharted water, with defense spending in the Clinton 
blueprint falling to 3% or less of GDP, levels not seen since the Great 
Depression. The reductions amount to $200 billion over five years from the 
amounts agreed to in the 1993 budget. Worse yet, the cuts get progressively 
larger, building to over $60 billion per year by 1998, unadjusted for 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since one out of five dollars America spends on defense -- for personnel, 
bases and procurement, including aerospace -- is spent in California, the added 
drawdown on a pro rata basis would cost California $8 billion on average over 
five years, growing to $13 billion per year by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse yet, the Clinton budget does not provide sufficient funds for Clinton's 
own defense program! Defense Secretary Les Aspin told President Clinton that 
the Pentagon's so-called bottom-up review will require $50 billion more over 
the next five years than in Clinton's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Private estimates are larger. That's at least another $10 billion per year for 
the country -- and roughly $2 billion per year and growing for California, 
bringing the state's total hit by 1998 to at least $15 billion per year, about 
1.5% of the gross state product. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the primary purpose of defense budgets should be to provide 
national security commensurate with America's role in a dangerous and still 
volatile world. Many defense experts, such as former Defense Secretary Dick 
Cheney, believe the Clinton plan is extremely risky; Californians certainly 
have learned the devastating consequences of being unprepared for danger. The 
state must bear its fair share of a prudent defense drawdown, but it should not 
be forced to bear a disproportionate share of one that damages the nation's 
security. 
</P>
<P>
 Even last month's earthquake can't compare to the Clinton defense plan in 
terms of the harm done to the state's economy. The $15-billion to $30-billion 
estimate for quake damage is a one-time cost. The federal government will pay a 
hefty share for rebuilding infrastructure and emergency relief; the current 
estimate is $8.6 billion. Private earthquake insurance will pay part of the 
repair cost for about one-third of homeowners. Thus, a sizable fraction of the 
cost will be paid from outside the California economy. 
</P>
<P>
 If roughly $15 billion is borne by Californians, by borrowing or digging into 
savings, the annual cost equivalent is about $1 billion at current mortgage or 
home equity rates -- less than one-tenth the annual cost of the Clinton defense 
drawdown. And the rebuilding -- while expensive and inconvenient -- probably 
will give a slight net boost to the California economy over the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Most private experts believe, and recent economic data suggest, that 
California's economy has about bottomed out. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the strong drag of the defense drawdown, the state finally will start 
to grow after a long and steep recession in which half the job losses were 
attributable to the direct and indirect effects of recent and planned defense 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson and the Legislature sent a good signal last year with 
job-creating business tax reforms and cuts and workers' compensation reform, 
hopefully the beginning of the end of the anti-business, job-destroying tax, 
regulatory and legal environment in California. 
</P>
<P>
 If the state can get its fiscal and regulatory house in order and the Congress 
and President -- perhaps prodded by my talented former Stanford colleague, 
Defense Secretary William Perry -- move to a more prudent defense drawdown, the 
natural advantages of climate, ideal location for trade with Asia and Latin 
America, quality work force and entrepreneurial spirit and talent will once 
again make California a leading incubator of new business and employment 
opportunities, earthquake or not.

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: LONG-TERM MORTGAGES USUALLY MAKE MORE 
CENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Trying to save tens of thousands of dollars in interest charges, conservative 
home buyers and owners seeking to refinance are flocking to 15- and 20-year 
mortgages instead of the traditional 30-year variety. 
</P>
<P>
 But many financial experts say these borrowers are turning to shorter-maturity 
mortgages at the absolute worst time. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to a combination of low mortgage rates, rising tax rates and relatively 
strong potential returns in stocks and other investments, borrowers can end up 
thousands of dollars richer by choosing the 30-year mortgage instead. That's 
largely because 30-year loans will have lower monthly payments than 
shorter-term loans; homeowners can invest the difference and earn enough over 
the years to more than offset the added payments in later years. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, nearly one out of every two homeowners who refinances today opts 
for a short payoff of 15 or 20 years, says Robert Van Order, chief economist at 
the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. (Freddie Mac) in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The shorter loan term allows homeowners to secure a slightly lower interest 
rate and eliminate 15 years worth of interest charges. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, that's a compelling argument for a 15-year loan, acknowledges 
Tim Kochis of the San Francisco financial consulting firm of Kochis & Fitz. 
But, when you delve more deeply, you find that you lose more than a dollar in 
tax breaks and "opportunity" costs -- what you could make by investing the 
savings elsewhere -- for every dollar you save, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 How so? Thanks to historically low interest rates, you can reasonably expect 
to earn more on your long-term investments than you pay on your mortgage 
borrowings, particularly when you consider the tax advantages of mortgage 
interest expenses. Over the long haul, that means the person who borrows long 
term and invests the difference can be thousands of dollars ahead of the person 
who uses their excess cash to pay off their mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider two hypothetical borrowers, Jane and John. 
</P>
<P>
 They both have $100,000 mortgages that they're refinancing. They're both 35 
years old, have no long-term savings and both have $895 a month that they can 
invest either in their mortgages or elsewhere. They both want to retire at age 
65, at which time they plan to have no mortgage payments and live off the 
amount they've saved and invested. 
</P>
<P>
 John opts for the 15-year loan. It's got a 6.93% interest rate and requires a 
$895 monthly payment. When his mortgage payments are complete, John will put 
the $895 a month in a 401(k) retirement-savings plan that's invested in equity 
mutual funds, where he earns an average 10% return. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane takes the 30-year mortgage at a 7.4% interest rate. Rates on 30-year 
mortgages are generally between 0.4 and 0.5 percentage points higher than 
15-year loans, according to Keith Gumbinger, analyst at HSH Associates in 
Butler, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Her monthly mortgage payment amounts to $692. She invests the $203 difference 
in a 401(k) plan that's also invested in equity mutual funds earning an average 
10% return. She continues to divide her $895 in investable income between the 
mortgage and the mutual funds throughout the 30-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of 30 years, they have both invested $322,000 and they both own 
their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 What about their savings? John has $370,951. Jane has $458,879. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane's magic was simply to earn more on her investments over a long period of 
time than she paid on her borrowings. In a sense, she earned interest on 
somebody else's money -- a concept that's made many a banker wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
 But is it realistic to assume Jane can invest her money at a higher rate than 
what she pays on her mortgage borrowings? If she's investing in stock funds, 
absolutely, says Ernie Mysogland, senior vice president and chief investment 
officer for Northstar Funds in Greenwich, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 People tend to think of stocks as a risky investment because stock prices 
fluctuate -- sometimes dramatically -- over short periods, Mysogland notes. But 
when you're investing for the long haul, the stock market's performance looks 
much more stable. In the 45-year period following World War II, stocks have 
posted an average annual return of 12.1%, Mysogland notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Over that period, the nation has suffered recessions, wars, political 
upheaval, soaring and plunging interest rates, so it wasn't a uniquely positive 
period for stocks, he says. There's no reason to think that the stock market is 
going to perform differently over the next 30 years, he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 What about the impact of taxes? In this case they tend to even out. Jane gets 
greater mortgage interest deductions, particularly in the early years. John 
makes larger 401(k) contributions, thus deferring taxes on larger portions of 
his salary, in the later years. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, financial advisers say there are instances -- even in today's 
investment environment -- when a 15-year mortgage does make sense. Namely, if 
you are older and don't have time to wait out stock market gyrations, it may be 
safer to pay off the loan. Also, if you're undisciplined and know you would 
spend the $203 difference instead of saving it, you're better off paying off 
the mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 "A 15-year mortgage isn't a bad idea, there's just something better," says 
Kochis. "And given the numbers we're looking at today, the alternative is much 
better."

KEYING INTO LITERATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Frustration was the catalyst that drove two Garden Grove brothers to start 
World Library Inc., which publishes literary works on CD-ROM. 
</P>
<P>
 After searching reference books for three days to find an obscure quotation 
from 18th-Century German philosopher Immanuel Kant, Robert Hustwit came up with 
the idea of poring over great literature electronically. He and his brother, 
William, launched their company in 1989 and published the first edition of 
"Library of the Future" in June, 1990. It contained the texts of 450 works of 
literature. 
</P>
<P>
 The family-run business soon followed with editions that included even more 
text. The $395 third edition had 3,500 works plus illustrations and video 
clips. 
</P>
<P>
 World Library now has 20 titles and has shipped about 200,000 copies. 
Distributors include Compton's NewMedia, an electronic encyclopedia publisher 
that is one of the industry's largest multimedia companies. 
</P>
<P>
 William Hustwit said he expects sales to double or even triple this year, and 
the privately held company will be moving its headquarters from Garden Grove to 
Irvine to accommodate that growth. "As more consumers buy computers with CD-ROM 
drives, they want a lot more than just text," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Building on its success, World Library recently started a subsidiary to go 
beyond the electronic book. Called Cinerom Inc., it is headed by Hustwit's 
27-year old daughter, Sharon. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, a joint venture with Hollywood Select Video Corp., will launch in 
mid-February "The Gospels: A Multimedia Bible Guide." The $49.95 title contains 
nearly two hours of video, more than 100 illustrations, and audio segments of 
the four religious texts of the Bible. The user will be able to listen to 
passages of Scripture while reading them on the screen or watching scenes from 
Biblical movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Cinerom Inc. also aims to publish a series of CD-ROMs adapted from home video 
titles such as "The Three Stooges" and "Our Gang." In effect, the subsidiary 
will create interactive movies, Sharon Hustwit said. 
</P>
<P>
 While "Library of the Future" appealed to researchers and book lovers, she 
said, "I think Cinerom will have a wider appeal, especially among younger 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 As improved data storage techniques enable the company to put as many as six 
movies on a single disc, William Hustwit said, the CD-ROM could be a rival to 
the videocassette. "You could watch all three parts of 'The Godfather' on one 
disc," he said. DEAN TAKAHASHI

BIG BETS PLACED ON GAME DISCS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Though Virgin Interactive Entertainment in Irvine isn't a huge company, it has 
the backing of the world's biggest toy maker and the world's biggest video 
rental company. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasbro Inc. and Blockbuster Video Entertainment have invested more than $55 
million in the video game publisher in the past few months, so Virgin has 
plenty of money to spend on its next-generation CD-ROM titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Virgin Interactive President Martin Alper predicts that compact discs will be 
one of the fastest-growing segments of the video game business, mainly because 
profits on CD games can be much higher than on Nintendo or Sega cartridges. 
Floppy disk games, which can require 10 disks, cost about $12 apiece. Nintendo 
game cartridges can cost $25 to produce. But a single CD-ROM costs less than $5 
to produce and stores more than 600 times the data of a floppy disk. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 7th Guest," a game developed by Trilobyte Inc. in Oregon and published by 
Virgin, ranks No. 1 on Computer Gaming World's list of top CD-ROMs. 
</P>
<P>
 Alper said "The 7th Guest" will have sold more than 500,000 copies through 
retail outlets and in bundled software packages by spring. And he has even 
greater expectations for "The 7th Guest's" sequel, "The 11th Hour," to be 
released in May. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has high hopes for a CD-ROM interactive drama that is being written 
especially for the medium by best-selling horror novelist Clive Barker. That 
title, "Ectosphere," is scheduled for a release as early as Christmas, 1995. 
And in the interactive music disc genre, Virgin expects this year to release 
"Virtual Graceland," a computer-animated trip through Elvis Presley's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Such titles can generate more profits than Nintendo games that sell 1 million 
copies, Alper said, largely because of lower costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The market is sure to get a boost, too, when Blockbuster begins offering 
CD-ROMs in its video rental stores. Blockbuster is already testing CD-ROM 
software and hardware rental in its San Francisco area stores. DEAN TAKAHASHI

INTERPLAY DIGS DEEP TO DEVELOP DISCS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a decade of producing computer games on floppy disks, the head of 
Interplay Productions Inc. in Irvine gave the order last year to shut down all 
new production of such titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, company President Brian Fargo invested $3 million in new computer 
equipment and diverted all development money to CD-ROM games. He feared a drop 
in sales as the company shifted, but the trough never appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe it's going to be a CD-ROM world, at least by Christmas," Fargo said 
in an interview at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas in January. 
"CD-ROM is steaming ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with 20 CD-ROM projects already being developed, Interplay is digging 
deep into its pockets for money to do more. Last week, the company announced 
that it has invested in Northstar Studios, a new Palo Alto company headed by 
video game industry veteran Ronald Spitzer. Fargo said the investment was a 
strategic move that will generate CD-ROM games and games on other platforms for 
Interplay over the next several years. 
</P>
<P>
 With an estimated $60 million in 1993 sales, Interplay is now Orange County's 
second-largest video game company behind Virgin Interactive Entertainment Inc. 
Half of its revenue comes from CD-ROM game sales, Fargo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides creating new titles, Interplay is making money by converting older 
floppy disk titles to the CD-ROM format. In the next several months, the 
company plans to release a new version of "Sim City" -- a popular game that 
simulates the growth or decline of cities -- on CD-ROM with video and enhanced 
computer animations. 
</P>
<P>
 An added incentive for such conversions is that the CDs are a read-only 
format, so they can't be pirated easily. The data is permanently encoded and 
can't be erased or modified. 
</P>
<P>
 Fargo estimates that for every floppy-disk game his company sold, eight to 10 
illegal copies were made. 
</P>
<P>
 Some rewritable discs are being made, but the CD-ROM drives necessary to play 
them are expensive. Yamaha Corp. of America in Buena Park plans to introduce 
one such product this spring for about $3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want the industry to create a rewritable CD as a standard," Fargo 
said. "If that happens, then we're back to the drawing board." DEAN TAKAHASHI

COMPETITORS PLAY CD-ROM CATCH UP

<P>
 The success of companies like Virgin Interactive Entertainment and Interplay 
Productions Inc. has video game competitors scrambling to avoid being left 
behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunsoft Inc. in Cypress, which expects sales of $80 million this year, has 
relied in the past on subcontractors to develop most of its Nintendo and Sega 
video games based on Warner Bros. cartoon characters.The company has waited for 
the CD-ROM market to grow before launching such games -- and now the moment is 
at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 David Siller, director of product development, said the Japanese-owned company 
is searching for new headquarters space and is recruiting a team of about 20 
game designers and development artists for the future. The company has also 
licensed rights to make games based on DC Comics super-heroes Superman and 
Batman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The CD-ROM is coming, and we'll be there developing games on it as it makes 
economic sense," Siller said. "We'll show people how to make a real compact 
disc game. By 1995, you'll see our first of the next generation CD-ROM games."

COMARCO DISPUTES OVERCHARGING CLAIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Comarco Inc., a provider of wireless communications and engineering systems, 
said it disputes a claim by a customer it declined to name that says it was 
overcharged by $5.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement released Friday afternoon, Comarco Chief Executive Don M. 
Bailey said the dispute is over indirect charges passed along to the client 
over a seven-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yorba Linda-based company claims, however that the costs charged were part 
of its general and administrative costs charged on two of the customer's 
completed contracts, Comarco said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on our initial review, (Comarco) management believes that it has a 
strong meritorious defense, and intends to vigorously defend its position," 
Bailey said. "In addition, we believe that our reserves are adequate, and 
therefore do not currently plan to record any charge to this situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Comarco had fiscal 1993 sales of $84.7 million. The company's stock closed 
unchanged at $4.875 a share on the Nasdaq market Friday.

VIETNAMESE FACTIONS PROTEST TRADE BAN'S END; O.C. RALLIES: IN A SHOW OF UNITY 
IN LITTLE SAIGON, MARCHERS ASSAIL CLINTON, CALL FOR HUMAN RIGHTS IN VIETNAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 About 600 demonstrators from rival Vietnamese factions set aside political 
differences Saturday, uniting to protest President Clinton's decision to lift 
the trade embargo against their native land. 
</P>
<P>
 Two separate rallies merged in Little Saigon as Vietnamese exiles, young and 
old, carried banners calling for human rights in Vietnam. Among them were about 
a dozen veterans of the Vietnam War and relatives of missing U.S. servicemen. 
All chanted their animosity toward Clinton for what they termed a betrayal of 
their cause against communism. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now is not the time to be frustrated or to give up," Diem Do, a rally 
organizer, told the protesters who punctuated his every word with claps and 
cheers. "The Vietnamese people will carry on with our struggle to restore 
democracy and human rights to Vietnam. Only in a free and democratic Vietnam 
can the fate of our missing servicemen be determined." 
</P>
<P>
 Do and about 400 others had gathered in the Vietnamese commercial district on 
Bolsa Avenue Saturday morning in the exile community's first collective show of 
opposition to the end of the trade embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstrators later were joined by 200 others who attended the swearing-in 
ceremony at the Westminster Civic Center for Ban Binh Bui, the new president of 
the Vietnamese Community of Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 In his acceptance speech, Bui encouraged the crowd to put aside political 
differences to continue the fight against communism in their homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 His group is an umbrella organization that represents more than 300,000 
Vietnamese residents from San Diego to Santa Barbara. Of the 5,000 people who 
voted in a January election in the organization, 2,273 cast ballots for Bui. 
</P>
<P>
 As Bui spoke Saturday, supporters passed around petitions that ask Clinton to 
demand improved human rights from the Hanoi government before moving toward 
full diplomatic relations with Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Bui extended the olive branch toward his opponents, who had accused him of 
winning by fraud, and invited them to be on an advisory committee to draft a 
battle plan against Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to attack them instead of reacting to their attacks," said Bui, a 
resident of Irvine. "Let's pull together our knowledge of the Communists to 
continue our fight." 
</P>
<P>
 He urged those gathered not to think of the lifting of the 19-year-old trade 
ban as a victory for the Communist nation, but merely as a routine decision by 
the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
 He also became the first Vietnamese leader in the community to concede in an 
official speech that the opening of Vietnam's trade might benefit its citizens. 
Previously, leaders have branded as Communist anyone who says the lifting the 
trade ban would bring a higher standard of living to Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Communist nations that have gone through economic changes also go through 
political changes," Bui said. "Their thinking will have to retreat little by 
little until democracy flourishes in Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
 In another first in the history of Southern California's exiled Vietnamese, 
the new president acknowledged that there are shades of opinions in the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Though there is some bickering among expatriates, Bui said, "no one has beat 
his chest to say that he is a Communist. We are all against communism, but we 
just have varying views." 
</P>
<P>
 Across town, Bui's rival in the election, Huu Dinh Vo, had also called for 
reconciliation as he stood in front the 400 protesters on Bolsa Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to work together; we need to support each other. For too long, some 
of us have been unnecessarily fighting among each other," said Vo, president of 
the Pomona Vietnamese community and a co-chairman of the Vietnamese Community 
of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is time for us, the Vietnamese, to work together because we all have the 
same hope, and that is that one day, our people in Vietnam will be free once 
more," he said. "And when that day comes, we will be able to return to our 
homeland and help rebuild it." 
</P>
<P>
 When the two rallies came together at noon in a peaceful union, traffic on 
Bolsa Avenue came to a standstill. 
</P>
<P>
 People marching on the street carried flags of the former Republic of Vietnam 
-- three red stripes on a yellow background. Others held black flags 
representing U.S. prisoners of war and those missing in action. Still others 
carried banners calling for more human rights in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 All chanted their anger over the lifting of the embargo. They shouted: 
"Freedom for Vietnam! Democracy for Vietnam! Human Rights for Vietnam! Freedom! 
Democracy! Human Rights!" 
</P>
<P>
 Motorists honked and waved to the demonstrators. Two American veterans of the 
Vietnam War, one on crutches, stood at a corner and shook hands with the 
marchers, who in turn patted the veterans on their backs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe the world watched Pepsi pass out their cans on the streets of 
Vietnam right after the embargo was lifted," said Stewart Resmer of Santa 
Monica, holding a Coke can as he stood supported by his crutches. "I find that 
very offensive, totally absurd." 
</P>
<P>
 One marcher, holding a "Clinton Betrayed Us" sign, invited passersby to join 
the rally. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're on an important mission," he said. "The Vietnamese need to join each 
other and fight because we won't win if we don't work together." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the bystanders joined and picked up the chant. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Bolsa rally, a parade of speakers bitterly assailed Clinton as a 
traitor to their cause. 
</P>
<P>
 They also encouraged each other not to give up their fight to restore 
democracy in Vietnam and to have all unanswered POW/MIA questions resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lifting of the embargo simply means that we will have to adjust our 
tactics in a new environment," said organizer Do. 
</P>
<P>
 He and other speakers asked people to boycott "businesses that blatantly 
ignore the misery of the Vietnamese people and the pain of the MIAs' families." 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of POW/MIA groups clasped hands with Vietnamese Americans at 
the rally, sealing a promise both groups made to work together and do 
everything possible to prevent the United States from establishing full 
diplomatic ties with Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hanoi needs to listen to Americans, and we're all Americans here," said Fran 
Masterson, 60, of Upland. Masterson's husband was declared missing in action in 
1968 in Laos. "We need to tell them: 'No more lies.' "

ASSESSING HITS, ERRORS OF '3 STRIKES' CRIME BILL IN O.C.; JUSTICE: THE 
FELON-FIGHTING BIDS ARE SEEN AS LONG OVERDUE BY THE D.A. AND THE PUBLIC, BUT 
OTHERS WARN OF PITFALLS.

<P>
 Each time he comes home to Santa Ana from his latest stint behind bars, Jose 
Hilario tells his mother the same thing: "I'm not going to get into trouble 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 And each time, he winds up proving himself a liar, his mother says, led away 
by the cops for gangbanging, or doing drugs, or even helping in a drive-by 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 One week shy of his 19th birthday, the high-school dropout is heading off this 
week for his first trip to the big house -- state prison -- after he allegedly 
threatened someone with a screwdriver and stole a car. 
</P>
<P>
 It's just another turn in what Hilario's friends and family members fear is an 
endless cycle of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But under a slew of new proposals that have gained momentum in Sacramento 
after the murder of Polly Klaas, a 12-year-old Petaluma girl kidnaped from her 
home by a habitual criminal on parole, Hilario and people like him may not get 
many more chances to screw up; three "serious" or violent felonies could land 
them behind bars for life. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea passed a key hurdle this past week when the state Assembly approved 
five versions of the legislation, sending the bills along to the Senate. 
Supporters, led by a man whose daughter was killed by a parolee outside a 
Fresno restaurant in 1992, are also trying to get a statewide measure put 
before voters on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The "three strikes and you're out" proposals, as they've become popularly 
known, have met with some resistance from district attorneys around the state 
who question whether the legislation would accomplish what proponents claim. 
Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, for instance, says lawmakers are 
overreacting to public "fear" with legislation that may be too severe. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Orange County, Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi sees the proposed 
legislation as long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (the measure) is going to pass, either through the legislative or the 
ballot initiative process. It's pretty evident from the speed with which it's 
now driving through the Legislature that they're finally doing something," 
Capizzi said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Capizzi says the Klaas tragedy has fueled legitimate public concerns about 
putting dangerous felons in prison and keeping them there. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public does not want to live with that potential danger, and there's no 
reason they should," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, those pushing for tougher sentencing requirements are quick to point 
to numbers demonstrating a "revolving door" of habitual criminals in the 
system. Several recent studies have shown that more than 60% of prison inmates 
are rearrested within a span of several years. And with each passing 
conviction, the odds of reincarceration grow higher. 
</P>
<P>
 A startling 84% of voters surveyed in a recent poll said they supported the 
"three strikes" concept. Yet amid a wave of public support for the idea, there 
are pitfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the measures could reverse gains made by Orange County officials 
in two key areas. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when the county has spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on 
programs to help delinquents straighten out their lives, the "three strikes" 
measure would eliminate any chance of reform for some felons. And at a time 
when the county has trumpeted successes in cutting down on the time and expense 
of trials, the measure could clog up the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult to believe that anyone who's considered this doesn't believe 
it's going to have a significant impact on the caseload (in the courts). It 
doesn't take a rocket scientist to figure that out," said James L. Smith, 
presiding judge for the Orange County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The thinking is this: 
</P>
<P>
 Only about 5% of the more than 8,000 felony cases moving through the Orange 
County courts each year actually go to trial, because the overwhelming majority 
of criminal defendants agree to plead guilty in plea-bargained deals with 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 But if three serious or violent felonies are bound to land a criminal in 
prison forever, offenders will be far less likely to cop a plea, and would 
instead insist on time-consuming jury trials where a "reasonable doubt" by only 
1 of 12 jurors could set them free. Facing life behind bars, the thinking goes, 
these defendants would have little to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could arguably be malpractice for (a defense) attorney to plead out a case 
that could mean life in prison for the defendant," Smith said. He estimated 
that the "three strikes" measure could mean twice as many trials in Orange 
County, increasing demands on public defenders, prosecutors, judges and other 
facets of the court system. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a lot of ways, I tend to be sympathetic, and agree with the philosophy 
that's behind the legislation," Smith said. "But for (lawmakers) to stick their 
heads in the sand, and ignore the practical results of the legislation. . . . 
To me, that's absolutely ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say they aren't sure how many Orange County felons might be "thrown 
out" under the "three strikes" measure. 
</P>
<P>
 But clearly, said defense attorney Gary Pohlson, the newly installed president 
of the Orange County Bar Assn., "it's going to jam up the courts in some ways, 
because people are going to fight these things instead of making a deal. That's 
a real problem for the court system." 
</P>
<P>
 But Capizzi argued that the measure could end up saving the court system time 
and money, eliminating the prospect of seeing the same offenders over and over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than have 30 arrests, 30 prosecutions and 30 victims" for the same 
offender, the district attorney said, "it might be far more economical to put 
him in prison for life for three convictions." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the issue of fairness. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the cost of the measure, both Smith and Pohlson maintained that 
lawmakers should give prosecutors and judges some discretion in setting 
punishment on a case-by-case basis, instead of putting every defendant who 
qualifies behind bars for life. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could get some guy in a situation where it's not appropriate to end up in 
prison for life," Pohlson said. "Suppose somebody's had some ticky-tack 
burglaries, and all of a sudden he gets convicted of a violent crime. There 
could be situations where it's just not as serious as people (drafting the 
legislation) had contemplated." 
</P>
<P>
 The measures now being considered in Sacramento clash on some critical points, 
centering on the issue of what types of felonies should count as "strikes" 
against an offender. 
</P>
<P>
 While some of the proposals would send a three-time loser away only for 
violent felonies, such as murder, rape or aggravated assault, others are 
broadened to encompass other nonviolent felonies. As defined in the state Penal 
Code, these serious crimes include residential burglary or selling drugs to a 
minor. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Smith sees the distinction as crucial, saying only violent crimes should 
be included. "I just don't find (sending away nonviolent offenders) to be an 
acceptable solution to the problem. That's just a Jean Valjean approach -- you 
know, (steal) the bread and send them away for life. If you're going to do 
that, you might as well just execute them." 
</P>
<P>
 The wording of the broader proposals would mean, for instance, that someone 
like Brian (Flaco) Martinez, 26, would not have any strikes against him -- even 
though he entered guilty pleas in connection with nine separate burglaries in 
Santa Ana, Orange and Anaheim in 1990 and 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 And 30-year-old Ronald Gene Herndon, who has been convicted of four felonies 
-- one each year between 1989 and 1992 -- would only have one strike against 
him, for a residential burglary in Anaheim, even though he has been convicted 
of felony narcotics crimes in both San Clemente and Anaheim, as well as an 
escape from the prison where he had been sentenced for the burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because the proposals regard residential burglaries as "serious 
felonies," but not commercial break-ins. And narcotics crimes are only viewed 
as serious under the three-strikes initiative if someone is caught selling 
narcotics to a minor. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez admitted to having stolen tens of thousands of dollars in cash, 
stereos, computer equipment and other items at a church, a realtor's office, a 
flower shop, hair salons and several other commercial locations, but never at a 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 He was also charged in 1991 with assaulting a man with a stun gun, but that 
charge was dropped as part of a plea bargain that Martinez struck with 
prosecutors. He was released from state prison in September, 1992, and 
completed his probation four months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 For someone like Jose Hilario, however, the prospects of avoiding the reach of 
the "three strikes" legislation appear dimmer. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 18, Hilario has been in trouble with the law for the past several years, 
getting into trouble too many times to count, says his girlfriend, 18-year-old 
Claudia Miranda. "Most of the time he gets picked up (by police), they don't 
even take him to jail. They just take him home to his parents," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 After several stints in the juvenile correction system, Hilario's first 
conviction as an adult felon came in 1992 after he and two friends went looking 
for rival gang members who they thought had painted over their graffiti. One of 
his friends shot another man dead outside a house, and Hilario served less than 
a year in County Jail as an accessory to murder. 
</P>
<P>
 He stayed clean only a few months. Last July, he was arrested in Santa Ana 
after he allegedly threatened a man with a screwdriver, robbed him of $20 and 
stole a car, court records show. Police also found crack on him, Miranda said. 
</P>
<P>
 Convicted on a probation violation, he was sentenced to 16 months behind bars. 
Now in custody in the Orange County Jail, he is heading this time for his first 
stint in state prison -- perhaps as early as Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 With or without a "three strikes" law working against him, Lilia Hilario 
worries that her son may have already lost any hope he once held for the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 Even at the young age of 18, life on the outside appears bleak for an ex-con, 
she said. "He says to me, 'Mom, how am I going to find a job after this? They 
might as well keep me here.' "

LIFE'S DRAMAS PLAY OUT VERY PUBLICLY AT SHELTERS; QUAKE: REFUGEES ADAPT TO THE 
FORCED INTIMACY AMID THE BICKERING AND CAMARADERIE, MISERY AND JOY. 
</P>

 They have smelled the feet of strangers and sometimes heard them in the throes 
of furtive sex. They have staked out their own little neighborhoods and made 
new friends and enemies. They have comforted babies whose names they do not 
know, squabbled over whether to watch TV shows in Spanish or English and 
yearned like tortured prisoners for a night of peaceful sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 For a couple thousand earthquake refugees still living in 25 shelters, this is 
the end of Week 3 on the gym floor -- where privacy exists only in your head 
and silence is a fantasy. The displaced have adapted with varying degrees of 
success and enthusiasm, bringing with them the tensions and compassions of the 
outside world. There is interracial bickering, toy-sharing and camaraderie. The 
forced intimacy has bred contempt and understanding, misery and joy. 
</P>
<P>
 And every bit of it is played out in public. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing what you see here," 15-year-old Jessica Serrano said with a mix 
of wonder and amusement as she spoke late last week of her home under the 
basketball hoops, the women's gym at Los Angeles City College. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, the shelter life is almost too much to bear. "It's somewhere between 
hell and the twilight zone," groaned one of Jessica's gym mates, Virginia 
Johnson, 41. "I keep waking up every morning and realizing it's real -- it's 
not a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 For others it is a friendly haven, in some ways more hospitable than their 
prior environs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a colonia (neighborhood) without walls," said Marin Rivas, 55, who 
lived alone in an unheated garage before the quake drove him to the Red Cross 
shelter at the San Fernando Recreation Center. "We talk, we play cards. The 
only problem is all the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more than anything, shelter life resembles a slumber party with 
reluctant adult guests: Only the children seem to be in a truly celebratory 
mood, giddy with new playmates. 
</P>
<P>
 They careen across the wood floors, sliding on pieces of cardboard, wildly 
pushing toddlers in walkers and tossing balls within centimeters of heads. They 
rush en masse into a bathroom to tease the occupant. And they never, never seem 
to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 The shrieking and crying are unceasing. Every little footfall is amplified in 
the gyms' cavernous spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 "They run all night, and if they don't run, they cry," sighed Johnson, a 
writer from Oakland who had been in Los Angeles for only a short while when the 
Jan. 17 Northridge quake struck, damaging the friend's apartment she was 
staying in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to like children, but I never want to hear another baby cry," she 
added, shaking her head. 
</P>
<P>
 In the city college gym, the floor was still crowded with cots last week -- 
although they were emptying as the shelter population declined from a high of 
320. 
</P>
<P>
 Absent tenants leave small signs on their beds, claiming their tiny patches of 
real estate beneath the grimy blue walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gone to service center. I be here today. Mario," read one on a recent day. 
Mario also wanted to leave no doubts about which pink acrylic blanket was his. 
"Mario. Don't Toch," he had scrawled in heavy blue ink. 
</P>
<P>
 Some cots bore the touches of home: A comforter decorated with big, smiling 
Dalmatians, a small, stuffed gorilla toy standing sentinel over another bed. 
The favored storage method was black plastic trash bags, always bulging. 
</P>
<P>
 Jessica Serrano sat on her folding cot, dispensing shelter tales like the 
village grande dame. Around her sprawled several younger girls, playing and 
coloring books distributed by shelter management: "I Love Not Smoking." Across 
the gym a Bugs Bunny cartoon blared from one of two televisions in the room. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, the TVs, the TVs are a problem," the teen-ager acknowledged with a roll 
of her eyes. "People want to see (shows) in English and we want to see them in 
Spanish. And they wind up off." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that television is the only source of skirmishes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The little girls are always fighting over their boyfriends," said Jessica, 
who arrived at the shelter a week after the quake with her mother and older 
brother -- having spent a few days with friends, as well as in their car. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are the mothers. "The mothers get in fights because they don't want 
other kids taking their kids' toys," Jessica explained. The police were 
summoned to quiet one tussle between moms. "They started fighting like little 
boys, pulling hair and punching each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Ever observant of the social dynamics of shelter life, Jessica and her friends 
have dubbed one single mom "Sexy." 
</P>
<P>
 "We named her Sexy. She's not sexy, but she thinks she is," Jessica said 
knowingly. "She doesn't talk to the ladies. She talks to the men, the married 
men." 
</P>
<P>
 Jessica also keeps an eye on her belongings. "If you move from your bed, 
things go away from your bed like that, " she said with a wave of her hand. 
Since $500 worth of food stamps were stolen from one woman, Jessica's 
20-year-old brother sleeps with their meager cash ("the $18 we've had since the 
earthquake") and even takes it to the shower -- wrapped in a plastic bag. 
</P>
<P>
 Some disagreements are more charged than tiffs over toys and soap operas. 
Racial friction has flared between Latinos -- who made up about 90% of the city 
college shelter's residents -- and blacks, who express frustration with Red 
Cross management. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a segregated gym," said Benny Gibbs, 39, who accuses management 
of favoring Latinos and whites. "The blacks became very standoffish, stayed to 
ourselves. . . . When you're living in close quarters like this it causes a lot 
of tension. People were really getting hot." 
</P>
<P>
 Shelter officials say that given the circumstances and the mix of people, 
there have been amazingly few disruptions. "But sometimes, no matter what you 
say or do, it's not going to change problems that existed before this 
disaster," said Ce Anderson, the city college shelter manager, who usually 
works in her father's boat business in San Pedro. "I think we have a very 
select group that are unhappy." 
</P>
<P>
 At the San Fernando Recreation Center shelter, the lone African American, 
Willie Moore, 43, of Sun Valley, also feels isolated. His wife died of lung 
cancer three days before the quake and he says he is glad his apartment was 
condemned because he could not bear to live there without her. Grief-stricken 
and dispirited, he is able to summon up only anger for his fellow shelter 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of prejudiced people here," Moore said. "This drunk guy came 
up to me and said all these things he was going to do to me. I told the Red 
Cross and I can't believe they didn't do anything about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the shelter's occupants are Latinos from poor neighborhoods in the 
northeast San Fernando Valley, where they shared crowded apartments with 
relatives or other families. The gym deprived them of what little privacy they 
had previously enjoyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's too many men," declared Esther Morillo, 27, whose one-bedroom Pacoima 
apartment was condemned, leaving her and nine others -- including her four 
children -- homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most of her shelter mates, Morillo sleeps in her clothes and changes in a 
bathroom stall. 
</P>
<P>
 The group showers -- set up in a blue tent in the surrounding park -- do not 
offer much more escape from scrutiny. Even sex and illness have an audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see that short, fat lady over by the TV? She's the one we heard in bed 
last night having a real good time," said security guard Hugo Macias, adding 
that the sounds prompted a certain amount of tittering. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the laughter is cruel. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was this old man watching TV and he started shaking and spilling his 
coffee, and the kids were laughing and pointing," recounted Josefina Morillon, 
29, a San Fernando resident who arrived at the shelter with her six children 
shortly after the quake. "It turned out he was having a heart attack." She said 
he survived. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as Luis Antonio, 24, well knows, the shelters are at least less public 
than the streets, where he had been living before the quake, picking up day 
labor jobs. "I'm going to be straight with you," Antonio said. "I'm very 
comfortable here." 
</P>
<P>
 Others, such as Arnold Garcia, 66, resent the routine. He said the lights pop 
on at 6 a.m., and switch off at 10 p.m., regardless of whether residents like 
it or not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we were going to be here only a couple of days and then they place 
you," lamented Garcia, who said he is having difficulty finding an apartment 
for himself and his 10-year-old grandson because his income is only $1,050 a 
month. "I didn't realize it was going to be forever and forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Morillon, who reported the heart attack, takes her mind off the discomforts by 
volunteering in the shelter kitchen. A religious woman, she has also found 
herself acting as a volunteer cop of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw this lady shooting drugs in the bathroom and reported her because of 
the kids," Morillon said. "I'm still waiting for my sheriff's badge," she 
joked. "But, really, we are in this together, and we have to take care of one 
another like a family." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Robert Gatewood, 24, says that at its best the Hollywood High School 
shelter has been like one big happy family, with people helping one another. A 
tad less impressed with all the togetherness, his wife, Annie Tucker, 21, said: 
"It's a good shelter; they supply you with everything you need. It's just the 
people in the shelter." 
</P>
<P>
 But then she concedes that she has made some friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I decided I have to live here with these people so I might as well get along 
with them," she said, holding one of the couple's twin infants. "I found a 
group of people and we're real close." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Laird, 23, who used to sell cleaning agents, even enjoys all the 
youthful high jinks. "You can have a depressing day and come here . . . and 
kick back on your cot and watch the kids and realize it's just not that 
serious." 
</P>
<P>
 One thing he would like to know, though. "Why do all these shelters smell like 
feet?"

 The United States warned Saturday that it stands ready to support NATO air 
strikes in Bosnia-Herzegovina's civil war and branded the shelling of a crowded 
Sarajevo marketplace "a deliberate criminal attack." 
</P>
<P>
 "We rule nothing out," President Clinton said of possible U.S. responses to 
the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 The President ordered a stepped-up role for the U.S. military in evacuating 
the wounded. In a written statement, he asked that the United Nations "urgently 
investigate this incident and clearly identify those who are guilty." 
</P>
<P>
 "There can be no possible military justification for an attack against a 
marketplace where women, men and children of the city were pursuing their 
everyday lives," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher, using particularly harsh language, 
called the action "a deliberate criminal attack designed to kill large numbers 
of innocent civilians." 
</P>
<P>
 He kept alive the possibility of sending jets from the United States and other 
NATO nations on raids over military positions -- but only if responsibility for 
Saturday's attack can be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the sharp words, there was no firm indication that the United States 
and others in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization would ultimately respond 
with force. U.S. leaders, in particular, have expressed willingness to 
retaliate with air strikes in the past but have taken no action. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of NATO's potential involvement, no air strikes can be 
launched without the approval of the U.N. Security Council. And Secretary 
General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has stipulated that ground forces be reinforced 
in advance of any use of air power that could be expected to spur retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 Other U.S. officials took note of the failure to act as they reacted to the 
carnage Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said that while the massacre was 
tragic, it was "not surprising in light of the international community's utter 
lack of will and principle in responding to nearly two years of aggression 
against Bosnia." 
</P>
<P>
 And Rep. Frank McCloskey (D-Ind.), a member of the House Armed Services 
Committee, called the attack "a major turning point and an escalation in the 
war in Bosnia." 
</P>
<P>
 Urging Clinton to support the bombing of Serbian artillery positions, he 
asked, "How many people have to suffer death, maiming, destruction and 
dispersal from their homes before Bill Clinton and the West move ahead and do 
the right thing?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the attack, at least 66 people were killed and more than 200 others wounded 
when a single large shell struck a busy marketplace. It was the bloodiest 
attack on the ravaged citizenry of Sarajevo in the 22 months of war there. 
</P>
<P>
 Although U.S. officials were careful to avoid fixing blame, they sought to 
squelch any suggestion that Bosnian Muslims had fired the shell to discredit 
their Serbian enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Administration official said the President's decision to use American 
aircraft to evacuate wounded Sarajevans demonstrates a new readiness to step up 
U.S. involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 While U.S. aircraft have been used, reluctantly, for past medical evacuations, 
Clinton's order to Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of 
Staff, was seen as a more aggressive stance. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Department spokesman Dennis Klauer said Saturday night that the first 
plane was being dispatched from Rhein Main Air Base in Germany in time to reach 
Sarajevo at first light today. 
</P>
<P>
 While the statements from the White House and State Department suggested 
growing impatience, the Pentagon made it clear that it is not about to dispatch 
ground troops without full support from the warring parties. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States is not ready, NATO is not prepared to send armies into 
Bosnia . . . against the will of the people," Defense Secretary William J. 
Perry said in Munich, Germany, where he was attending a conference on security 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 But Perry said that the United States remains willing to "consider stronger 
action, including air strikes."

SKATING PANEL CALLS HEARING ON HARDING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND and RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tonya Harding moved one step closer Saturday to possible expulsion from the 
U.S. Olympic team when a U.S. Figure Skating Assn. panel unanimously called for 
a disciplinary hearing to determine the extent of her role in the Jan. 6 attack 
on rival Nancy Kerrigan. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel's hearing procedure allows 30 days for Harding to respond to its 
statement of charges. The figure skating team is officially named on Feb. 21, 
so that leaves the decision on Harding's participation in the hands of the U.S. 
Olympic Committee. The USOC can suspend her from the team after its own 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 USOC officials in Lillehammer, Norway, said Saturday that they will decide 
later this week whether to call a hearing of the 13-member Games Administrative 
Board to determine Harding's status. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a hearing, they said, would be held in Norway within the next two weeks. 
The opening ceremony for the Winter Olympics is Saturday in Lillehammer. 
</P>
<P>
 Some USOC officials, who did not want to be identified, told The Times that it 
is virtually certain that the hearing will occur but that the organization is 
exercising caution until all of the legal ramifications are explored. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to get as much information as possible," USOC Executive Director 
Harvey Schiller said. "It's important that the entire matter be given as much 
consideration as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 The USOC was put in this position when the five-member figure skating panel 
said there was reasonable grounds to believe that Harding, the U.S. national 
champion, violated the association's code of ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 But because of the USFSA's 30-day hearing period, the decision on Harding's 
status for the Olympics was left to be determined by the USOC. 
</P>
<P>
 The figure skating panel determined that Harding "committed an act, made a 
statement, or engaged in conduct detrimental to the welfare of figure skating 
and/or failed to exemplify the highest standards of fairness, ethical behavior 
and genuine good sportsmanship in her relations with others." 
</P>
<P>
 The panel also found that Harding "committed an act to carry out a plan and/or 
was involved in a plan to injure Nancy Kerrigan; or knew about a plan to injure 
Nancy Kerrigan and either failed to oppose it, failed to report it, or made 
false statements about her knowledge concerning it." 
</P>
<P>
 William Hybl, the panel's chairman, said if Harding does not respond within 30 
days, the disciplinary hearing will be held without her. 
</P>
<P>
 The USOC must submit names for the figure skating competition on Feb. 21. The 
figure skating panel will now give the USOC more than 300 pages of documents 
and several videotapes to assist in its decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ball's back in the U.S. Olympic Committee's court," Hybl said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to USFSA rules, President Claire Ferguson could have removed Harding 
from the Olympic team after hearing the panel's findings. But she chose to 
defer action. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until she (Harding) has had her fair chance at the hearing panel to make her 
statements and ask her questions, it would be wrong for me to take a position 
to kick her off the team," Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the USFSA announcement, Harding emerged from the Portland, Ore., 
apartment where she is staying with a friend but said nothing to reporters who 
are maintaining a daily stakeout there. 
</P>
<P>
 Her primary attorneys, Dennis Rawlinson and Robert Weaver Jr., issued a brief 
statement: "USFSA does not conclude that Ms. Harding has in any way been 
involved in any wrongdoing or in any way violated its code of ethics. The 
statement of charges is based upon conflicting evidence, including, in part, 
allegations by (Harding's ex-husband) Jeff Gillooly and (her ex-bodyguard) 
Shawn Eckardt, which Tonya has denied," the lawyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonya Harding will respond to the statement in compliance with the bylaws and 
rules of the USFSA. We would like to thank the USFSA for strictly adhering to 
its bylaws and rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Another of her attorneys, Brian Burton, earlier remarked: "Obviously we're not 
happy that they decided it was sufficient to proceed. But we're not overly 
concerned at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 Hybl, past president of the USOC, said the USFSA panel members took great 
pains to ensure that Harding's rights were protected. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharon Watson of Los Angeles, chairwoman of the USFSA's sanctions and 
eligibility committee and a member of the USFSA's board of directors, said the 
decision was difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's painful to see someone who has spent her whole life training for this 
and whose future in a sense is resting on this," she said. "We had to be sure 
we gave her a fair shake. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the other hand, seeing something like this happen in our sport and happen 
to Nancy . . . it's a real tragedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Schweitzer, athletic director of the Air Force Academy, said that as the 
panel examined the evidence it was apparent "not everything was right." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the message we send is loud and clear, and it is very important for 
athletics across the spectrum," Schweitzer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan, a Bronze Medal winner at the 1992 Games in Albertville, France, was 
clubbed on the right leg on Jan. 6 in Detroit. The attack the day before 
competition knocked her out of the U.S. Figure Skating National Championships. 
But the USFSA named her to the U.S. team anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding later acknowledged she learned after the attack that people close to 
her were involved but that she failed to report immediately to authorities what 
she knew. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillooly has pleaded guilty to racketeering in the attack, and three other men 
have confessed to taking part. Harding has not been charged and denies any 
involvement, but Gillooly and one of the alleged conspirators have implicated 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing panel, which also will determine any disciplinary measures, 
reviewed 20 areas of evidence in making its decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the evidence was uncovered by the panel's counsel, John Bennett, a 
former Portland prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 Hybl said Bennett, working with a private investigator, is conducting an 
independent investigation into the allegations on behalf of the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some specific questions and charges that John is looking at," Hybl 
said. "We need to tie up some loose ends." 
</P>
<P>
 Hybl also said that the panel took into account Harding's history as a 
representative of the USFSA. He refused to elaborate on why Harding's past was 
a factor in the panel's conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 If the USOC calls a hearing in Norway, Harding would be invited to appear 
before the board, as required by the Amateur Sports Act of 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiller said Harding's attorneys were informed of the possibility of a 
hearing but would not say if their client would appear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would expect her to come," said John Ruger, the chairman of the USOC's 
athletes' advisory council and a member of the Games Administrative Board. 
"Whether that will make a difference or not remains to be seen. She didn't go 
to Colorado Springs. I don't know if that worked for her or against her." 
</P>
<P>
 In her last major public statement Jan. 27 on the Kerrigan attack, Harding had 
pleaded to stay on the Olympic team, saying she was not involved in the attack 
and had done "nothing to violate the standards of excellence, of sportsmanship 
that are expected in an Olympic athlete." 
</P>
<P>
 One member of the Games Administrative Board is USOC Vice President George 
Steinbrenner, who contributed $20,000 to Harding before this year's national 
championships. Schiller said he did not believe that Steinbrenner's presence on 
the board represents a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think it would be inappropriate for him to participate in any 
function of the USOC," Schiller said. 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed out that Steinbrenner has contributed money to many amateur 
athletes, including figure skater Michelle Kwan of Torrance, who received 
$7,000 from the New York Yankees owner last year. 
</P>
<P>
 If Harding does not skate in either the Olympics or in the World 
Championships, she will be replaced by Kwan, the first alternate, because of 
her second-place finish in the national championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Harding scheduled no skating practice this weekend but reserved after-hours 
time at her local rink Monday through Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 It has not been disclosed when she is scheduled to leave Oregon for Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors in Portland, meanwhile, said that the grand jury investigation of 
the attack on Kerrigan would continue next week and "at least" into the 
following week. 
</P>
<P>
 Almond reported from Colorado Springs and Harvey from Lillehammer, Norway. 
Times staff writer John Balzar in Portland contributed to this story. Statement 
of Charges 
</P>
<P>
 Following are excerpts from the statement of charges against Tonya Harding 
issued Saturday by the U.S. Figure Skating Assn.: 
</P>
<P>
 After considering the evidence presented, and after providing you an 
opportunity to present evidence, the hearing panel has unanimously determined 
that reasonable grounds exist to believe that you have violated the code of 
ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing panel has determined that reasonable grounds exist to believe: 
</P>
<P>
 (a) that Tonya Harding 
</P>
<P>
 (b) while a member of the USFSA 
</P>
<P>
 (c) committed an act, made a statement, or engaged in conduct detrimental to 
the welfare of figure skating and/or failed to exemplify the highest standards 
of fairness, ethical behavior and genuine good sportsmanship in her relations 
with others. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing panel further finds that reasonable grounds exist to believe that 
Tonya Harding: 
</P>
<P>
 (a) committed an act to carry out a plan and/or was involved in a plan to 
injure Nancy Kerrigan; or 
</P>
<P>
 (b) knew about a plan to injure Nancy Kerrigan and either failed to oppose it, 
failed to report it, or made false statements about her knowledge concerning 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the hearing panel has determined, based upon the evidence 
presented to it . . . , that reasonable grounds exist to pursue disciplinary 
proceedings against you. 
</P>
<P>
 . . . You have 30 days to submit your reply to these charges. Upon receipt of 
your reply, the hearing panel will set a place and date, at the earliest 
possible time, for the hearing reasonably convenient to all parties.

66 DIE AS SHELL RIPS THROUGH BOSNIA MARKET; SARAJEVO: TWO HUNDRED ARE INJURED 
AS CHAOS REPLACES ROUTINE IN THE WORST ASSAULT ON THE CAPITAL SINCE THE 
FIGHTING BEGAN. CLINTON SAYS HE IS 'OUTRAGED' BY THE 'COWARDLY ACT.' 
</P>

<P>
 A single, large-caliber shell slammed into an open-air marketplace in Sarajevo 
on Saturday, killing at least 66 people and injuring more than 200 in the worst 
attack on the Bosnian capital since the country's civil war began. 
</P>
<P>
 The 120-millimeter mortar was fired from northeast of the marketplace just 
after noon as people took advantage of fair weather to stock up on provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 In seconds, chaos replaced routine. Victims were laid out on tables that had 
once held the meager goods offered for sale. Blood spattered the concrete. The 
dead were lined up along a wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a little difficult to identify the victims and the number of killed, 
because a lot of them are in pieces," morgue worker Alija Hodzic told the 
Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. officials were unable to pin blame for the attack on any of Bosnia's 
warring parties. They said that U.N. troops are analyzing the crater to 
determine the shell's origin. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman from Bosnia's Muslim government said the shell was fired from a 
Serb-held position. Serbian leaders denied the charge and even suggested that 
government soldiers had fired on their own people as a way of persuading the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization to go ahead with threatened air strikes on 
Serbian positions. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, President Clinton said he was "outraged" by the "cowardly act" 
and called on the Pentagon to dispatch U.S. aircraft to Sarajevo to help 
evacuate victims. Clinton repeated a U.S. promise to support NATO air strikes, 
although he gave no indication that such a move was imminent. And he urged the 
United Nations to "urgently investigate" who was to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali repeated that call, and his 
special representative to the Balkans, Yasushi Akashi, planned to go to 
Sarajevo today. 
</P>
<P>
 Akashi reportedly will try to use the macabre incident to help persuade the 
warring factions to make more strident efforts at the bargaining table. Bosnian 
peace talks had been set to resume Thursday in Geneva. 
</P>
<P>
 "I express my outrage and that of the whole international community at this 
unspeakable act of barbarity," Akashi said in a statement. "We shall be 
carrying some specific proposals to the parties for concrete action to reduce 
the tensions." 
</P>
<P>
 The marketplace, partially enclosed by buildings at least three stories high, 
had been considered relatively safe from much of the shelling that has besieged 
the capital for 22 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes after the shell struck, the air was filled with the voices of wailing 
survivors and the howl of ambulance sirens. Rescue workers commandeered the 
green canvases that had covered the market stalls to ferry away the dead and 
wounded. Other bodies were loaded onto open trucks and vans because there were 
not enough ambulances and morgue vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Graphic television footage showed rescue workers scrambling to take survivors 
to Sarajevo's Kosevo Hospital. One survivor shouted: "Thank you, Boutros-Ghali! 
Thank you, Clinton!" 
</P>
<P>
 Many in Bosnia-Herzegovina have become increasingly frustrated with the United 
Nations and the United States for their inability to prevent further bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
 Munever Bavtic, who was shopping on the square when the blast occurred, told 
the Associated Press: "This was done by the world, not by the Chetniks (Serbian 
forces). You must send greetings to all those politicians out there sitting in 
their armchairs -- it wasn't their kids who were killed today." 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic echoed the woman's remarks. In an 
interview on CNN late Saturday, Silajdzic warned the international community 
that the horrific scenes they were watching were "coming to your doorsteps." 
</P>
<P>
 He placed blame for the attack on the international community and the U.N. 
Security Council, which has refused to lift an arms embargo that has kept 
Muslim forces from securing arms to protect themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. Manojlo Milovanovic, the Bosnian Serb army chief of staff, demanded from 
Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, the U.N. commander in Bosnia, that Serbs be included on 
a commission to investigate the latest massacre. Otherwise, he warned, Serbian 
forces would sever all cooperation with the U.N. force and all humanitarian 
organizations as of Monday. There was no immediate U.N. reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic suggested that Muslim government soldiers 
fired the deadly shell as a means of forcing the international community to 
retaliate against the Serbs. That charge was immediately dismissed by the 
Bosnian government. 
</P>
<P>
 NATO allies have threatened to use their air power in the Bosnian war, but 
only with U.N. Security Council approval. Boutros-Ghali has been reluctant to 
back allied air strikes without reinforcement of ground forces. In addition, 
Clinton Administration officials have characterized previous attacks on 
Sarajevo as either below the threshold for allied response or as a justified 
retaliation for Bosnian Muslim ground assaults. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's attack came just a day after 10 people were killed and 18 wounded 
in shelling of the Sarajevo suburb of Dobrinja.

ANC OFFICES TARGETS FOR TERROR BOMBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB DROGIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The late-night bomb exploded without warning, shattering windows in five shops 
and offices and scattering shrapnel that cratered concrete, pierced metal 
frames and splintered wood furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the broken glass and debris, the target was obvious: The bomb -- one of 
at least 30 tallied by police since late December -- had been placed on the 
doormat of the recently opened office of the African National Congress. The 
black-led ANC is the largest political party and likely winner of the country's 
first democratic elections this April. 
</P>
<P>
 "This area is a conservative area, right wing," explained the local ANC 
leader, Neo Mutle. "And putting an ANC office in this place, we should expect 
retaliation." 
</P>
<P>
 The wave of terror has seen a sudden surge, with nine bombings since 
Wednesday. Targets have included ANC offices, billboards and homes of 
supporters. Two explosions Friday night derailed a freight train and destroyed 
a rural electric pylon, blacking out a small town. 
</P>
<P>
 No one has been killed and no one has claimed responsibility, but police and 
other authorities say they have no doubt who is to blame: increasingly 
desperate far-right whites, who have repeatedly threatened to use violence to 
sabotage the transition to black majority rule after more than three centuries 
of white domination. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have every reason to believe it is the far right wing," Craig Cotze, 
spokesman for the Ministry of Law and Order, said Saturday. Police have made no 
arrests, he said, partly because they have too many potential suspects in the 
ever-splintering network of neo-Nazi, pro-apartheid groups. "It could be any 
one of 200 far-right-wing groups. . . . It's hard to point the finger at any 
one group." 
</P>
<P>
 Cotze and other officials warned that the suspected right-wing terror campaign 
could mark the start of a long-threatened war of resistance by racist militants 
who are demanding a self-ruled white homeland and are opposed to the country's 
first all-race elections, scheduled for April 26-28. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must expect the closer we get to the election, the more extremist 
right-wing behavior will manifest itself," Cotze said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 4,000 people died in political violence last year, and officials 
fear even greater carnage unless the right-wingers and other ANC opponents are 
somehow persuaded to join the democratic process. Intensive, closed-door talks 
to bring the holdouts on board have been deadlocked for months, with only a 
week to go before a deadline expires for political parties to register for the 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotze cautioned that the right-wing threat should not be underestimated. 
</P>
<P>
 "They operate in cells," he said. "Many have special training from the 
military or police. They are well-armed. They are highly motivated. We're 
dealing with formidable opponents." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Maninger, spokesman for the Afrikaner Volksfront, a coalition of 60 or 
so right-wing groups, said his organization is not involved in the bombing 
campaign. But he didn't deny that right-wingers are responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an indication of the frustration on the grass-roots level," he said. 
"We've been experiencing a lot of problems trying to restrain people because 
they feel the negotiation process has brought nothing. We feel marginalized, 
and a lot of individuals are becoming restless." 
</P>
<P>
 On a campaign swing through the Western Transvaal and Orange Free State, the 
right-wing strongholds where the bombings have been concentrated, ANC President 
Nelson Mandela grimly warned that the bombings could backfire. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have made a mistake by trying to use force to intimidate us," he told 
cheering black supporters who packed a soccer stadium Friday in Maokeng, a 
township outside Kroonstad. "People are angry, and we're finding it difficult 
to stop them from taking the law into their own hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Mandela chided several dozen mostly white business leaders in 
Sasolburg for staying silent while armed right-wing whites try to "turn this 
country into Bosnia, into Somalia." 
</P>
<P>
 "The threat from the right wing is to plunge the country into civil war," 
Mandela said. ". . . When that happens, it is not just blacks who are going to 
die, as is happening now. Blacks and whites are going to die." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the ANC bombed Sasolburg's sprawling synthetic-fuel-producing 
complex in 1980, when ANC-backed guerrillas attacked symbols of the apartheid 
regime. Two chemical tanks were destroyed, and a guard was wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Richard Goldstone, who heads a widely respected independent commission 
that investigates violence in the country, said last week in an interview in 
Johannesburg that the ultra-right threat will probably be most severe in the 
weeks ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the causes of political violence is . . . people who want to derail 
the current process and stop the election," he said. "After the elections, that 
threat is gone." 
</P>
<P>
 The demand to create a self-ruled white homeland appears impossible to 
fulfill. Mandela, who is almost certain to become the country's first black 
president, has repeatedly said he will not allow the dismemberment of the 
nation to satisfy a militant white minority. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing of the sort will ever happen," Mandela said Friday. "They are going 
to live in South Africa like everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 But the demand, among others, lingers on the table in negotiations among the 
ANC, the government and a coalition called the Freedom Alliance. The alliance 
is made up of the Afrikaner Volksfront, the right-wing umbrella group, together 
with several anti-ANC black leaders, including Mangosuthu Gatsha Buthelezi, who 
heads the Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the more bellicose members of the Volksfront, neo-Nazi leader Eugene 
TerreBlanche, insisted at a right-wing rally Saturday that the demand for the 
homeland, or volkstaat, is non-negotiable. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mandela, give us a volkstaat or you'll have total war in South Africa," he 
told several hundred khaki-clad followers, according to the South African Press 
Assn. He warned that "more explosions will occur from tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 As before, most of the bombings this week used commercial explosives. Among 
the targets was a wall outside the home of Jan Serfontein, one of the few white 
farmers supporting the ANC in Potchefstroom. He made local headlines when he 
greeted Mandela at a nearby training center for black farm workers Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Other targets included an ANC office in Ottosdal, two trade union offices in 
Klerksdorp and a community hall in Groot Marico. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in Bothaville, a sleepy white farming town where traffic signs are 
plastered with blue-and-white stickers that proclaim, "This is our Volkstaat ," 
the Jan. 17 bombing of the ANC office came as little surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Several hundred right-wingers gathered to block the road when the ANC opened 
the election campaign office downtown last fall. The white owner of the 
building later received telephone threats for renting the space. 
</P>
<P>
 Mutle, the local ANC coordinator and a former guerrilla, said the explosion 
caused up to $60,000 in damage. But he said the bombers failed if they hoped to 
frighten him or to force him to close the office he'll use to organize blacks 
to vote for the very first time in the land of their birth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The right wing, if they are trying to scare us, they are mistaken," Mutle 
said. "We know the danger. We expected this. . . . But whether they like it or 
not, we are going to use these offices."

COLUMN ONE; INS 'LIFERS' LOCKED UP IN LIMBO; THEY HAVE SERVED THEIR TIME BUT 
ARE CONSIDERED TOO DANGEROUS FOR RELEASE IN THE U.S. THEIR HOME COUNTRIES WON'T 
TAKE THEM BACK. SO A GROUP OF IMMIGRANT FELONS LANGUISH BEHIND BARS.

<P>
 The fine points of federal immigration law, with its statutes and technical 
revisions, are lost on Nirayo Tirfe, a former Ethiopian guerrilla once granted 
political asylum in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 His understanding is more visceral, coming as it does from being locked up 
indefinitely in a maximum security prison without any remaining criminal 
charges or even a sentence to serve. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. government tried to deport Tirfe after a marijuana conviction, but 
his country refused to take him back. Now he is stuck behind bars, a "lifer" in 
Immigration and Naturalization Service slang. 
</P>
<P>
 Like scores of other illegal immigrants, Tirfe is a man without a country, an 
undesirable under U.S. law who has become an international pariah. Immigration 
law says they have committed crimes ranging from drug offenses to murder that 
make them too dangerous to release here. 
</P>
<P>
 They have slipped into a void created by global politics and Congress' desire 
to get tough on immigrants who turn to crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The INS estimates that nationwide there are no more than 100 detainees who 
fall into this category. But over the next few years, hundreds more are 
expected to finish their prison terms, only to be warehoused by the INS. 
</P>
<P>
 A little-noticed legal fine point, included in the Immigration and Nationality 
Act of 1990, controls Tirfe's fate and handcuffs government officials required 
to keep him and others like him indefinitely behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 The law says these so-called "non-releasable aggravated felons" remain a 
danger to society -- even though they have completed their sentences in state 
or federal prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a problem that we feel as an agency -- having somebody locked up 
forever and ever," said John Simon, INS deputy assistant commissioner for 
deportation and detention in Washington. "We are trying to deal with it in a 
humane way." 
</P>
<P>
 Tirfe is told not to think of his time at the Orleans Parish Prison in New 
Orleans -- and before that at an INS detention center in Arizona -- as 
punishment, but as an administrative "hold" -- one that has stretched beyond a 
year. There is no relief in sight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not dangerous to society," Tirfe said from Mississippi's Hancock County 
Jail, where he had been moved temporarily so that he could speak to a reporter. 
"I didn't kill nobody. I didn't rob nobody. They lock me up forever because of 
these three lousy joints." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Tirfe, most detainees have been convicted under the country's 
zero-tolerance drugs laws, and some of the offenses involve relatively small 
amounts of drugs. Others are murderers, armed robbers and rapists. They all are 
illegal immigrants, including some, like Tirfe, who were allowed into the 
country but never completed the legal immigration process. 
</P>
<P>
 An immigration judge has ordered each of them deported, but if the order 
cannot be carried out, they must be locked up until another nation agrees to 
accept them. 
</P>
<P>
 That could take months, or years, or it might not happen at all. The U.S. 
government pays the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The list of such prisoners is growing so quickly that the agency has notified 
its offices throughout the country that "on a very select basis" they may send 
them to prisons and jails in the South. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, it is cheapest to house them -- the going rate in county and parish 
jails is $45 a day -- and the locals look upon the INS detainees as a cash 
crop. Prison construction, too, is booming. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't always agree with the INS holding them," said Hancock County Sheriff 
Ronnie Peterson as he strolled through the jail he runs in Bay St. Louis. "But 
we like the money." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although the number of such detainees is relatively small, the INS worries 
about those in the pipeline: inmates from Vietnam, the former Soviet Union, 
Cambodia, Laos, Iraq and Ethiopia who are serving state or federal prison 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the currents of international politics, these countries and a few 
others have generally refused to take back their criminal citizens. The INS 
says other countries -- such as Nigeria and Jamaica -- routinely engineer 
excessive delays. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's simple," said INS spokesman Duke Austin in Washington. "Countries don't 
want bad people back." (The U.S. repatriates American criminals deported by 
other countries.) 
</P>
<P>
 A check with state corrections departments in California, Texas, Florida, 
Illinois and New York, and the federal Bureau of Prisons, shows that as many as 
900 prisoners from these nations might one day become INS "lifers." 
</P>
<P>
 This does not include more than 5,000 Cubans who are serving state prison 
terms or being indefinitely held by the INS in local jails at U.S. expense. 
They have been the subject of on-again, off-again negotiations with Cuban 
President Fidel Castro. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at the Vietnamese, because we think that is going to be the 
core population," said John B.Z. Caplinger, INS district director in New 
Orleans, which has jurisdiction over detainees in Louisiana, Mississippi, 
Tennessee, Arkansas and Kentucky. "Right now, this ag (aggravated) felon thing 
is so new, we are still bouncing the ball to see which way it is going to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Caplinger said the law's intractability has created a Kafkaesque scenario 
where different branches of the U.S. government are playing tug of war over the 
fate of at least three INS prisoners who have been promised new identities 
under the federal witness protection program. 
</P>
<P>
 Their criminal histories make the prisoners "aggravated felons." But if they 
are deported, the presumption is they would be killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got prosecutors calling me every day," Caplinger said. "I've got people 
who testified against (former Panamanian strongman Manuel) Noriega who can't be 
released. That's how difficult this is." 
</P>
<P>
 Citing policy, a spokesman for the U.S. Marshals Service declined to confirm 
or deny any information about participants in the witness protection program. 
</P>
<P>
 The backgrounds of most other detainees are relatively mundane. 
</P>
<P>
 Abed El-Abed, a 35-year-old Palestinian born on the West Bank, entered the 
United States by walking out of New York's John F. Kennedy Airport when he was 
making a stopover in 1977, leaving behind his luggage and a Jordanian passport. 
Later, he opened a convenience store in Houston, got married and fathered four 
children in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, he was busted for selling heroin and served nearly seven years in 
federal prison in Texas. A positive drug test forced officials to revoke his 
immigration bond; he has been held by the INS at the federal detention center 
in Oakdale, La., for more than 17 months. The cost of his detention, according 
to prison officials, is $25,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan has refused to accept him, as have other countries he asked: Italy, 
Germany, Greece, Sweden, Denmark, Austria and Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 El-Abed said that if he cannot be freed in the United States, he would like to 
go home. "I prove to them that I am Palestinian and they still don't believe I 
am Palestinian," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 INS officials said that may be, but they will continue to list him as a 
Jordanian. There is no Palestinian state, much less one that would take him 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 Tirfe, the former Ethiopian guerrilla who fought the government for an 
independent Eritrea, also has nobody to come to his aid. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a written INS analysis placed in his file, his two convictions 
for simple marijuana possession are analogous to an aggravated felony under 
federal law. But Tirfe, 43, has no lawyer to challenge this argument, no money 
to hire one, and no hope of getting out. Ethiopia will not accept him and 
neither will anyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather stay three years in state prison than one year here," he said of 
his cell at the Orleans Parish Prison in New Orleans. "I'd rather take a chance 
to go back home, even though my life is in danger." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff Charles Foti Jr., who has run the 5,000-bed Orleans Parish Prison 
since 1974, confirmed that the non-deportable prisoners have been kept in 
lock-down 24 hours a day. He refuses to allow reporters to talk to inmates at 
the facility or to see the conditions in which they are held. 
</P>
<P>
 But asked about complaints by Tirfe and other detainees of being shackled 
every time they leave their cell and of being denied food, Foti snapped: "These 
are felons who are security risks, who demand maximum security. And while we 
are providing a service for the INS, that is how they are kept." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Tirfe: "They treat us like animals." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the Cubans who arrived in the United States 14 years ago as part of the 
Mariel boat lift -- and who won the right to an annual parole board review 
after rioting at federal prisons in Oakdale and Atlanta in 1987 -- the 
non-deportables have no higher authority to whom to appeal. The mechanism does 
not exist in the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing I have left is my sanity, for now," said Iraqi Khaled Najib, 
33, who served four years in federal prison for selling cocaine and is 
approaching eight months in INS custody at the federal detention center in 
Oakdale. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I did my time, I had something to look forward to. But this is torture." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very depressing, mental torture," said Vi-Kiet Giang, who served 10 
years in Idaho state prison for stabbing his fiancee to death in 1983, just a 
few months after the U.S. Navy rescued them from a rickety boat in 
international waters off Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was paroled from prison -- and Vietnam refused to take him back -- 
Giang was sent to the Orleans Parish Prison. Because Giang committed his crime 
before completing his legal admissions process, he may not be released on bond. 
</P>
<P>
 The law, insisted Simon of the INS, ties the agency's hands. "The intent of 
the law was good, but I don't think Congress realized what a bind they were 
putting us in," he said. "And what you have to understand is if you have just 
one guy who knows that he has nothing to lose, that he may never get out, 
that's a (potential security) problem." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, three internal INS proposals to give the agency more discretion to 
release aggravated felons remain just that. Another that could be submitted to 
Congress as a technical amendment to the Immigration and Nationality Act is 
under review by the INS general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 But some mechanisms exist to persuade nations to take their citizens back. The 
problem, according to the INS, is that they are rarely used. "As the most 
extreme step, the State Department is supposed to stop issuing immigrant visas 
to those countries," said INS spokesman Austin. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that has never happened, not to anyone's knowledge. They just don't do 
it. They are not willing to do it. And the foreign countries know it. So they 
say, 'Why should we bring them back here?' " 
</P>
<P>
 A State Department official, who asked not to be identified, said the U.S. 
government did briefly stop issuing immigrant visas to Cubans after the Mariel 
boat lift. 
</P>
<P>
 "There would be serious ramifications in this country to doing something like 
that," he said. "Who would you be hurting? You're talking about family members 
of immigrants here. These are not people coming to Disneyland or coming to buy 
goods." 
</P>
<P>
 Even when countries reach agreement on the repatriation of criminals, the 
best-laid plans can go awry. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first INS operation of its kind, the agency chartered a plane in 
December to return 74 male and nine female prisoners to Nigeria, a cheaper 
alternative than flying them commercially. 
</P>
<P>
 The detainees were held at Oakdale, in jails throughout Louisiana and in 
Miami. The Nigerian government finally issued travel documents for them. The 
operation took months to plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the Royal West 727 landed to refuel in Cape Verde, Nigerian 
authorities ordered the pilot to fly into Lagos -- where the U.S. government 
refuses to allow American aircraft to land for security reasons -- instead of 
Ibadan, the negotiated destination. 
</P>
<P>
 While negotiations between officials in Washington and Lagos continued, the 
refueling stop stretched past five hours and the prisoners, who were shackled, 
staged a revolt. 
</P>
<P>
 The leader had managed to slip his hands in front of his body, and strode to 
the front of the aircraft to encourage the others to make their move. Before 
order was restored, officials said, INS agents were bitten, shoved and kicked. 
</P>
<P>
 When the plane landed in Lagos, authorities there turned out the runway lights 
and tried to arrest the INS officials for bringing the Nigerian prisoners back. 
Finally, the prisoners were accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 INS headquarters later issued awards lauding the bravery of the 11 officers 
who made the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Soviet immigrant Alexander Okner's probation officer in Santa Monica describes 
him as a career criminal who has committed despicable acts. 
</P>
<P>
 "After he serves the longest possible prison sentence as allowable under the 
law, probation officer is hopeful that the immigration service can find some 
means by which this country no longer needs to accept his kind of refugee," the 
officer was moved to write in her report. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike Giang, who murdered his fiancee, or even Tirfe, convicted of 
possessing marijuana, Okner is not an aggravated felon under immigration law. 
That is why INS officials in New Orleans refused to accept him in Orleans 
Parish Prison, where agency officials in Los Angeles recently asked that he be 
moved. 
</P>
<P>
 Okner's most recent felony -- the kidnaping and rape of a Santa Monica woman 
-- took place in 1982. This crime, for which Okner served eight years in state 
prison, was not included in the immigration act's aggravated felon provision 
until 1990 -- and the law is not retroactive. 
</P>
<P>
 But INS officials in Los Angeles consider him such a threat to society that 
they have jailed him at the federal detention center at Terminal Island since 
October, 1992. They say they would like nothing better than to remove him from 
the United States, where he has lived for 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But they say their efforts have been stymied. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia refuses to take him, as does the Ukraine, the former Soviet republic 
where he was born. Israel, where he applied for admittance because of his 
Jewish heritage, has also declined. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, the INS took the extraordinary step of booking him and an 
immigration agent on an Aeroflot flight to Moscow, without travel documents. 
Russian authorities refused to let Okner in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to get out of here," Okner said from Terminal Island. "If I'm such 
a menace to society, and they don't believe that I've been rehabilitated, then 
deport me. This is a life sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope one day they will get me out of here, dead or alive. I've been 
promised employment (in Los Angeles). I want to marry my girlfriend, help my 
parents," he said. "If they think I will rape someone again, please make me a 
woman. Have the government pay for it. I'm serious." 
</P>
<P>
 Okner provided a letter from a psychiatrist who has treated him that said he 
"would pose no hazard whatsoever" if released. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, INS officials in Los Angeles say they have no intention of releasing 
Okner, despite a series of motions and lawsuits he has filed, despite his claim 
that he has changed and despite a desperate plea from his mother and father, 
who now suffers from cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 He has convictions for assault and battery, assault with a deadly weapon, 
extortion, kidnaping and rape. He has admitted using drugs. INS officials also 
suggested that the unsolved slaying of Okner's fiancee in 1981 has been weighed 
in their decision to keep him behind bars, although he has not been charged. 
</P>
<P>
 They say they will hold him "forever," if it comes to that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles has the strictest detention policy in the U.S.," said Donald 
Looney, INS deputy district director in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason behind this stance, INS officials indicated, is the case of Bela 
Marko, an illegal immigrant from Hungary with a long criminal record. The INS 
came under fire because Marko had been released from INS custody before he and 
Los Angeles Police Detective Russell Kuster killed each other in an October, 
1990, shootout. 
</P>
<P>
 Like today's non-releasables, Marko's homeland had refused to take him back.

BECKWITH IS CONVICTED OF KILLING MEDGAR EVERS; VERDICT: THE AVOWED WHITE 
SUPREMACIST, NOW 73, HAD BEEN TRIED TWICE BEFORE. HE IS SENTENCED TO LIFE IN 
PRISON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC HARRISON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thirty-one years after the assassination of civil rights leader Medgar Evers, 
Byron De La Beckwith, the man arrested within two weeks of the murder, was 
found guilty Saturday and sentenced to life in prison for the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 A cheer went up from spectators in the courtroom gallery as the verdict was 
read. Beckwith's wife, Thelma, broke into sobs. But the 73-year-old avowed 
white supremacist showed no emotion as Hinds County Circuit Judge L. Breland 
Hilburn handed down the mandatory sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite likely appeals, which a prosecutor acknowledged could keep Beckwith 
out of prison for the rest of his life, Myrlie Evers said the conviction 
fulfilled the promise she had made to her late husband to seek justice in his 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have prayed for either hearing (Beckwith) say he was guilty or a jury 
saying he was guilty," she said after the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 She praised the prosecutors who "went further than they had to" in pursuit of 
her husband's killer. 
</P>
<P>
 It was she who persuaded prosecutors to reopen the case four years ago after 
newspaper reports revealed new evidence of jury tampering in Beckwith's two 
1964 trials, which both ended in hung juries. She has been present for nearly 
every hearing or major development in the case since then. 
</P>
<P>
 She wept when the verdict was read Saturday and grasped the hand of her 
daughter, Reena Evers-Everett, while her eldest son, Darrell Kenyatta Evers, 
applauded. 
</P>
<P>
 After rushing from the courtroom in tears, Myrlie Evers sought a few moments 
of seclusion with her family. She said she wept, jumped for joy, let loose a 
shout and then raised her eyes to the heavens to tell her late husband: 
"Medgar, I've gone the last mile of the way." 
</P>
<P>
 She was still jubilant when she spoke to reporters. "It's been a long journey, 
and it's been a lonely one," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beckwith ordinarily would be eligible for parole in 10 years, but he might be 
eligible sooner because he remained in jail for more than a year while awaiting 
his most recent trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Beckwith's lawyers, who called repeatedly for a mistrial during the 
proceedings, left the court after the verdict and could not be reached for 
comment. An appeal, however, is widely expected. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury, made up of eight African Americans and four whites, deliberated for 
more than six hours Friday and Saturday before reaching a verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 The jurors, who had been chosen 140 miles north of Jackson in Panola County, 
were taken home by bus. Upon disembarking in front of the Panola County 
Courthouse, they told reporters they had agreed not to talk about the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were exhausted. They were just drained," Panola County Sheriff David 
Bryan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Evers, the 37-year-old field secretary for the NAACP, had been a highly 
visible crusader against segregation and for equal rights for African 
Americans. He was shot in the back on June 12, 1963, by a sniper hidden near 
his home. 
</P>
<P>
 An Enfield 30.06 rifle belonging to Beckwith was found hidden in a honeysuckle 
thicket nearby. One of Beckwith's fingerprints was on the scope, and witnesses 
identified his car nearby that night. 
</P>
<P>
 But two all-white juries were unable to reach a verdict in 1964. If Beckwith 
had been convicted then, he would have faced the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that justice has been done," said Dist. Atty. Ed Peters, whose 
aggressive and theatrical questioning of witnesses was among the dramatic 
highlights of the latest trial. "I'm sorry that it took so long, but I'm glad 
that it was done." 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Dist. Atty. Bobby DeLaughter said he felt vindicated by the verdict. 
"Now the world knows what we have known for years," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, he continued to offer justification for his pursuit of a case that 
many Mississippians, white and black, said they considered a waste of time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would've been derelict in our duty if we had not proceeded as we've 
proceeded," DeLaughter said, acknowledging that he, like the public, had mixed 
emotions about prosecuting so aged a defendant in a 30-year-old case that 
already had been tried twice before. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite criticism that he had reopened the case because of political 
ambitions, Peters said he did it "in spite of politics." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gotten two letters of praise and hundreds of letters of condemnation," 
he said, adding that he was stunned by apathy in the black community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shocked and dismayed at the number of black (prospective) jurors who 
said that we shouldn't be prosecuting the case, that they didn't know who 
Medgar Evers was and what were we doing wasting money," Peters said. "That was 
the last reaction I expected." 
</P>
<P>
 Myrlie Evers said she also was concerned by the lack of awareness of Evers' 
importance to the state. "I'm hopeful that from this point on he would be in 
his rightful place in history and people could be able to know who he was, what 
he did and be able to relate where they are now to what he did." 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently there have been few memorials to Evers in Jackson. When black 
leaders wanted to erect a statue to his memory, it took years to raise the 
money, but work is now under way to turn his home into a museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Myrlie Evers, a retired Los Angeles commissioner of public works who now lives 
in Oregon, said that seeing Beckwith for the first time since the 1964 trials 
was a traumatic experience. But by the end of the trial, he had become "a 
nonentity," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Darrell Evers, a Los Angeles conceptual artist who bears a strong resemblance 
to his father, said he attended the trial so that Beckwith could see "the face 
of the person he shot" in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 While family members said they knew Beckwith might never spend another day 
behind bars, Evers-Everett, who lives in Claremont, Calif., said: "I'm happy 
that it has been acknowledged that he did it." 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, prosecutors painted Beckwith as a "bushwhacking, ambushing 
coward" so opposed to integration that he was willing to kill for it, and as a 
man so cocky that he openly bragged of the murder to people who he thought 
would be impressed by it. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the six witnesses who testified that they heard Beckwith brag of the 
murder was one man who said Beckwith told a meeting of Ku Klux Klan members: 
"Killing that nigger didn't cause me any more discomfort than our wives have 
when they have a baby." 
</P>
<P>
 While Beckwith has always denied killing Evers in his frequent interviews with 
the press, his conversation has been littered with racist epithets aimed at 
African Americans and Jews, and he suggested that he was pleased by the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 While he was mostly silent during his trial -- he opted not to testify, his 
lawyers citing his waning memory and physical infirmities -- he wore a 
Confederate flag lapel pin into the courtroom every day. 
</P>
<P>
 His defense consisted largely of three police officers from his hometown of 
Greenwood, 90 miles away, who said they saw him there the night of the 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 But Peters told the jury that Mississippi police departments in 1964 were 
composed of men who tended to share Beckwith's segregationist beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 And James Holley, the only one of those witnesses to testify live in the 
courtroom, acknowledged that he had held strong segregationist views in the 
1960s.

TOWNS PAY THE PRICE WHEN GOVERNMENT VENTURES FAIL; TECHNOLOGY: LIST OF 
ABANDONED MEGA-PROJECTS GROWS. FOR PLACES LIKE IUKA, MISS., THE IMPACT IS 
PROFOUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By RUDY ABRAMSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The industrial complex 20 miles out in the piney woods north of Iuka looks 
like one of the New Age factories springing up in the Sun Belt. 
</P>
<P>
 On one side of the highway, a sprawling gray-and-white administration building 
sits in the middle of a freshly paved parking lot with spaces for 500 cars. 
Across the road, guards in crisp uniforms stand at gates leading to a 
high-security production area. Painted signs direct visitors and job-seekers to 
security and personnel offices still housed in temporary quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Landscapers have yet to install shrubbery, and winter has interrupted work on 
Route 25, which is being widened to four lanes between Iuka and the site on 
Yellow Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 But the vans that now come and go are moving people out, not in. 
</P>
<P>
 With work 80% complete, the government is walking away from this $1.5-billion 
installation because the budget-cutter's ax has fallen on NASA's plans to build 
more-powerful booster rockets for the space shuttle. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,000 construction workers have been let go, and a similar number of 
rocket engineers, secretaries and officials of the National Aeronautics and 
Space Administration will follow. 
</P>
<P>
 In Iuka, where residents had looked for the project to bring prosperity, the 
disillusionment is profound. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day Congress killed the project, "this was like a ghost town," said 
Harold Fulton, longtime owner of the local Piggly-Wiggly market. "Everybody 
just stayed at home. This was a despondent community." 
</P>
<P>
 For Fulton and his wife, Janet -- who had just modernized their store -- and 
all the other longtime residents of this community of 3,200 people, NASA's 
pullout evoked a strong sense of deja vu : This was the second time they had 
experienced a governmental change of heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Iuka's experience is an example of a phenomenon that is occurring across the 
nation with increasing -- and some say alarming -- frequency: The government 
launches an ambitious, expensive, high-tech project. Then, in the face of 
rising costs, technical difficulties or shifts in political currents, it walks 
away -- leaving billions of wasted taxpayer dollars in its wake. 
</P>
<P>
 The effects on some of the communities chosen to host such mega-projects can 
be devastating. 
</P>
<P>
 With expectations that Iuka would become a boom town, for instance, state and 
local taxpayers ponied up for improved schools, hospitals, sewers and roads. 
But when the NASA project failed, the community wound up instead facing an 
additional economic pinch replete with unemployment and rising crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The increasing inability to see ambitious projects through to completion is 
worrisome to many. The danger, say analysts in business and government, is that 
the United States will become unwilling to take on the challenging, 
groundbreaking, government-sponsored projects that have been its hallmark for 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be that the day of U.S. mega-projects -- such as the space shuttle, the 
superconducting super collider and the Hubble Space Telescope -- is already 
past and nations must share the risk in great technologies, said Rep. George E. 
Brown Jr. (D-Colton), chairman of the House Science, Space and Technology 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 In the future, multibillion-dollar science and engineering endeavors may be 
carried out "through international consortia or treaties," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Iuka's experience is extreme. Only a few years before the space 
agency arrived, the Tennessee Valley Authority left Iuka after spending $1.2 
billion on a nuclear power plant on the very same site now being vacated by the 
rocket people. 
</P>
<P>
 About the same time the TVA dropped the half-finished nuclear plant, work was 
completed on the Tennessee-Tombigbee Waterway, which joins the Tennessee River 
near the site. That ended jobs for hundreds more workers. 
</P>
<P>
 To the disappointment of Iuka residents, it quickly became obvious that the 
waterway -- which forms a shortcut from the Tennessee River to the Gulf of 
Mexico -- had not attracted the new industry they had dreamed about. 
</P>
<P>
 Unemployment shot to nearly 30%, and the area suffered a veritable crime wave. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden Tishamingo County had one of the highest arson rates in the 
United States," said Harold Luminek, an insurance agent in Iuka, "and you 
couldn't keep a Silverado pickup because somebody would steal it right out from 
under you." 
</P>
<P>
 The TVA's massive reactor-containment structure still stands amid the empty 
rocket-fabrication buildings. So does an incomplete cooling tower, rising like 
some Mississippi Stonehenge. 
</P>
<P>
 Altogether, calculates Iuka Mayor David Nichols, the TVA and NASA investment 
in the 1,200-acre site beside the little-used waterway amounts to about $2.5 
million per acre. For that reason, he and others had a hard time believing that 
the nearly finished rocket project would be killed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kept thinking that prudent people would eventually prevail in Washington," 
Nichols said. "It was hard to imagine even the federal government wasting that 
kind of money." 
</P>
<P>
 The Iuka experience is particularly notable because the town was left with two 
government lemons -- three if you count the Army Corps of Engineers' 
Tennessee-Tombigbee project. But the projects abandoned here are peanuts 
compared to other high-tech ventures that have been ditched. 
</P>
<P>
 On the same day the plug was pulled on the advanced solid-rocket project, 
Congress also axed the Energy Department's super collider -- upon which $2 
billion had already been spent. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as anything, the laboratory near rural Waxahachie, Tex., was a victim 
of cost overruns. The estimated tab had soared from $2 billion to $11 billion, 
setting off alarm bells in congressional offices all over Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of March, fewer than 1,000 of the 2,250 construction workers, 
scientists and engineers who were on the project last fall will be left. By 
summer there will be only 500, disposing of computer equipment, closing out 
laboratories and securing the 14 miles of 14-foot-diameter tunnel that had 
already been excavated for the huge atom smasher. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mississippi and Texas projects join a long, old and growing list of 
technological lemons, false starts and reversals that have cost taxpayers tens 
of billions of dollars since the beginning of the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is certainly not a new phenomenon," said Norman R. Augustine, chairman 
of Martin-Marietta Corp., "but it is getting worse." 
</P>
<P>
 For example: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Air Force and the old Atomic Energy Commission invested more than $1 
billion in a nuclear airplane project before it was canceled by President John 
F. Kennedy in 1961. Pushing for a separate military space program, the Air 
Force put another $1.7 billion into its own Manned Orbiting Laboratory before 
dropping it. Similarly, it dropped plans for a space glider it called Dynasoar. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Transportation Department spent nearly $1 billion on design and 
development of a supersonic transport plane before the congressional purse 
snapped shut. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the 1960s, the National Science Foundation undertook to drill a hole 
through the Earth's outer crust, but called it quits with the estimated cost 
soaring toward $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 * After spending $3.5 billion, the Energy Department dumped construction of an 
Ohio plant where it proposed to use centrifuges to enrich uranium. Plunging 
uranium prices and new technology overtook the venture when it was but a third 
completed. The department spent another $1.7 billion on its proposed Clinch 
River Breeder Reactor -- and an estimated $7 billion-plus on breeder technology 
-- before Congress concluded it was economically unjustified and 
environmentally hazardous. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the aftermath of the Middle East oil embargo and huge increases in oil 
prices in the 1970s, the government-backed Synfuels Corp. spent several billion 
dollars on a variety of sophisticated schemes to increase the use of coal. The 
massively unsuccessful undertaking was killed by the George Bush Administration 
as the United States again succumbed to the appeal of cheap imported oil. 
</P>
<P>
 * Killed by degrees, President Ronald Reagan's much ballyhooed and ridiculed 
"Star Wars" strategic defense initiative soaked up about $30 billion over a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Reasons for the waste go on and on: underestimated costs, overestimated 
results, unexpected difficulties, poor management, political uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
 Too often, said Robert M. White, president of the National Academy of 
Engineering, fragile and flawed designs emerge when officials faced with 
shrinking budgets take shortcuts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The space station is a good example. You come up with a design and it is 
approved by Congress. Then you find that the money you need is not going to be 
available, and you design to fit budget, and then you budget to fit design." 
</P>
<P>
 Redesigned three times in 12 years, the space station so far has cost $9 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Conceived during the heyday of the Cold War space race with the Soviet Union, 
the station is now expected to cost $30 billion to build and operate for a 
decade. Ironically, it may survive only because Russia is joining the United 
States, Canada, Japan and the European Space Agency in the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional opponents will make their bid to kill the project for good this 
year, having come within a single House vote in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sen. Barbara A. Mikulski (D-Md.), who chairs the subcommittee handling 
NASA appropriations, said the super collider cancellation "served as a wake-up 
call" for contractors and government officials involved in aerospace projects. 
</P>
<P>
 After years of debate, the mission of the space station is coming into focus 
and it has public support in spite of its troubled history, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin-Marietta's Augustine blames the space station dilemma and similar 
experiences on three fundamental problems: a year-by-year budgeting process 
that creates delays and rising costs, excessive reviews and investigations 
"that turn every little problem into a big issue," and a national "aversion to 
risk." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have reached a point," he said, "where the objective is to prevent 
anything from going wrong, rather than making things go right. The rewards are 
not for accomplishment, but for avoiding a hearing, a headline or an 
investigation. We have taken away much of the incentive for accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a very different atmosphere from that of 33 years ago, when Kennedy 
called for the United States to send men to the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 Warning of the heavy costs and obstacles in the project, Kennedy asked for a 
firm commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we are able to go only half way, or reduce our sights in the face of 
difficulty, in my judgment it would be better not to go at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no sense in agreeing, or desiring, that the United States take an 
affirmative position in outer space unless we are prepared to do the work and 
bear the burdens to make it successful. If we are not, we should decide today." 
</P>
<P>
 What has been decided these days, Rep. Brown said, is that wherever possible, 
high-tech projects should be "reduced in size, cost and duration." Objectives 
will be attacked in steps rather than leaps. Partners will be sought to share 
the risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a good time for good, long-range policy-making," he said. "Most 
members of Congress have no recollection of why we got started on many 
long-range projects. We have no institutional basis for planning beyond the 
next two years. It's a defect, but it's a defect that most democracies have." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, back in Iuka, plans have been announced for Thiokol Corp. to 
manufacture rocket nozzles at the abandoned NASA complex. About 850 engineers 
and technicians are to be at work there within two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The town's residents took the news, announced in December, with understandable 
skepticism. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had to bet my lunch money," said Luminek, the local insurance agent, "I 
would bet that they will be gone in three to five years."

A NEW POLITICAL FIRE TESTS COSTA; POLITICS: POLICE WILL NOT PURSUE CASE 
INVOLVING MARIJUANA FOUND IN ASSEMBLYMAN'S HOME. BUT ELECTION-YEAR INCIDENT MAY 
NOT BE AS EASY TO QUELL AS PREVIOUS RUN-INS WITH THE LAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Assemblyman Jim Costa was one of the bright, young lights on the Democratic 
scene when one summer night in 1986 he was charged with soliciting a Sacramento 
prostitute and a police decoy posing as a prostitute for a three-way sex act. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing of his arrest -- in the midst of a reelection campaign -- could 
have hardly been worse, and a chastened Costa returned home to Fresno and 
apologized to a roomful of supporters that included his mother and political 
mentors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I deeply regret my action," he said. "This is a bad dream that keeps 
recurring. I wish I could wake up from it." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, in the zeal of a new campaign for the state Senate, the San Joaquin 
Valley legislator hurried home to put out another potential political fire -- 
this time to explain why a small quantity of marijuana was found inside his 
Fresno condominium by police during a burglary investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The break-in occurred while Costa, 41, was in Sacramento pushing his "three 
strikes and you're out" anti-crime bill. The thieves made off with a VCR, cuff 
links, leather jackets, a keepsake watch, wine and beer. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa, whose home had previously been burglarized three times, said it 
"reminded me once again how painful it is to be a crime victim." 
</P>
<P>
 But voters who excused his earlier peccadillo may not be so forgiving this 
time. Rumors of fast living have dogged the veteran legislator, a bachelor, for 
years -- rumors he has attributed to dirty politics and speculation. Now his 
political opponents say Costa has stretched credulity with his explanation of 
how the marijuana debris and paraphernalia -- a hemostat, plastic sandwich bags 
and a 35-millimeter film canister -- got inside his bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 In a media blitz last week, he told voters that the residue and related items 
were left by either burglars using his condo to party or by someone trying to 
sabotage his political career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can only speculate that it was a drug-related crime or someone was trying 
to set me up politically," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although both scenarios have been deemed "possible but unusual" by Fresno 
police, the department will not pursue an investigation because the amount of 
marijuana is too small and the question of possession is too hazy. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the matter is not likely to end, not with a tough election around the 
corner in the 16th District, a conservative Democratic farm belt that stretches 
from Fresno to Bakersfield and is represented by Republican Sen. Phil Wyman. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyman's supporters are already calling it "two strikes and Costa's out." Wyman 
is not about to let it die. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm angry that Mr. Costa is trying to cover up his indiscretions by throwing 
a political charge of sabotage at me or someone associated with my campaign," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will not be sullied by a man who has been surrounded by controversy and 
questions of his lifestyle since we were both elected to the Legislature in 
1978." 
</P>
<P>
 Wyman has challenged Costa to a polygraph and drug test to "see which one of 
us is lying and which one of us is drug-free." 
</P>
<P>
 Costa, an eight-term assemblyman, called Wyman's challenge "shameful, 
insensitive and political grandstanding." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to play that game. I did nothing wrong. I'm a victim of crime 
and I wouldn't wish that on anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Costa's strong base of support has led to easy reelection over the last 
decade. He has been an effective voice in Sacramento on behalf of farmers and 
supporters of a San Joaquin River parkway and advocates of cleaner air through 
rail transportation. In 1990, he was chosen by fellow Democrats as caucus 
chairman -- one of the top party positions in the lower house. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim is as hard a working legislator as you will find," said John Krebs, a 
former congressman from Fresno and one of Costa's political mentors. "He has 
been a very effective advocate for San Joaquin Valley interests." 
</P>
<P>
 This work ethic, his supporters say, is rooted in Costa's youth, when he would 
awaken before dawn to milk cows on his father's dairy farm in west Fresno. But 
even they concede that Costa's skill and maneuvering inside the halls of 
Sacramento have been undermined at times by a careless, self-destructive bent 
when he stepped out. 
</P>
<P>
 One year after the prostitution incident, in which he pleaded no contest and 
was placed on three years probation, Costa's lifestyle was back in the news. 
Fresno County sheriff's investigators delving into a 1987 murder found photos 
of the main suspect, a Paraguayan drug dealer, socializing with Costa. 
</P>
<P>
 The assemblyman told the Fresno Bee that he and the drug dealer had been 
friends. "I started wondering about how he supported himself and then I sort of 
distanced myself from him when I found out about his reputation as a big drug 
dealer," Costa was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 As for last week's incident and Costa's explanation that political foes may 
have planted the marijuana, his supporters say the theory is not as improbable 
as it sounds. They note that the behavior of whoever broke in was bizarre. 
Burglars left many expensive items while taking items of sentimental value to 
Costa. They also spent some time rifling through Costa's photos and papers. 
</P>
<P>
 David Provost, a political science professor at Cal State Fresno, said Costa 
probably made a mistake raising the specter of dirty tricks and thus giving 
Wyman a chance to seize the moral high ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Costa) left an opening for the Wyman people and they took it," Provost said. 
"But I still don't think this whole episode will have a lasting effect. The 
public forgave him once and even if they believe the marijuana was his I think 
they'll forgive him again."

OUT ON A LIMB; DEVELOPMENT ENCROACHING ON BALD EAGLES' ROOSTS AT BIG BEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM GORMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They return here each winter: distinguished bald eagles, stealthily swooping 
low over mountain lakes, standing sentry-like on patches of ice, perching 
proudly atop the tallest Jeffrey pines. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, this mountain valley has hosted the largest concentration of bald 
eagles in Southern California, wintering here from as far away as northern 
Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 By day, they patrol Big Bear and smaller lakes from the shoreline, scouting 
for dead fish or waiting to snatch a coot, their favorite waterfowl feast. At 
night, they retreat deeper into the quiet woods to roost in seclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is growing concern that the endangered bald eagle is being squeezed 
out by development, and that these San Bernardino Mountains will no longer 
provide winter hospitality. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Forest Service is in its third year of trapping bald eagles so they 
can be fitted with radio transmitters, tagged and monitored to determine how 
many return each year, and where they roost at night. 
</P>
<P>
 The objective, said Forest Service wildlife biologist Robin Butler, is to 
protect parts of the forest favored by the bald eagles. This is accomplished by 
learning where the birds spend their nights and ensuring that trails, 
campgrounds and other human amenities do not intrude on the birds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Forest Service started counting Big Bear's bald eagle population in 1978. 
The numbers have ranged from as high as 28 in winter 1983-84, to as low as 12 
in winter 1988-89. Last month, 16 eagles were counted in the valley by a score 
of volunteers who took positions around the lake and conducted a head count of 
the national symbol. 
</P>
<P>
 Local experts say the fluctuation in numbers is due, in part, to how harsh the 
winters are farther north and the availability of food. If local lakes are 
mostly frozen, the bird will migrate farther south. 
</P>
<P>
 But biologists and residents are fearful that the bald eagle could be scared 
away by residential and commercial development here, at neighboring Lake 
Arrowhead and at several adjoining lakes. The bald eagle can tolerate the 
intrusion of humans near its day perches, but demands seclusion at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents are going to court to protect the bird. Ann and Dave Bellis, 
who live along Papoose Lake, just west of here, are suing San Bernardino County 
to force a new environmental impact report on a planned eight-acre subdivision 
near them. The land is a popular perch site for the bald eagle, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 Ann Bellis said the removal of 120 trees for street widening late last year 
was tantamount to an eviction notice for the eagles. She said she wants to halt 
construction on the housing tract -- which was approved more than 10 years ago 
by the county -- before more damage is done. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said that because the tract was approved, it cannot be 
stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, county planners say they are sensitive to development encroaching on 
eagle habitat. Four years ago, county land-use planners rejected a proposed 
resort because it was planned for an area that was host to both the bald eagle 
and rare plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Other proposed developments have been approved after plans were redrawn to 
save as many trees as possible, in accordance with the county's tree protection 
ordinance, said Randy Scott, a county environmental planner. 
</P>
<P>
 The bald eagle is listed on national and state endangered species lists, 
although officials say it will soon be downgraded to a "threatened" species 
because its numbers have steadily increased in recent years. But state and 
federal wildlife officials cannot automatically block a proposed development 
because of the effect it might have on the bald eagle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under the Endangered Species Act, unless there is a demonstrable, significant 
impairment to the eagle, we don't have the authority to stop a project," said 
Phil Detrich, coordinator of threatened and endangered species for the U.S. 
Fish and Wildlife Service in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, no one has been able to show that development at Big Bear has directly 
jeopardized the return of the bald eagle each winter. The northern shore of Big 
Bear Lake and the land surrounding Baldwin Lake is owned by the Forest Service, 
and is free of development. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, experts note, it is politically harder to protect the eagles' winter 
habitat because, unlike their nesting habits during the summer, they are 
transient in the winter. If the migrating eagles loses one winter site, they 
can search for another. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, bald eagles have been spotted at Lake Perris, Lake 
Matthews and Vail Lake in Riverside County, Lake Cachuma northwest of Santa 
Barbara and as far south as San Diego County and northern Baja. Before 
post-World War II development, the wintering bald eagle was frequently spotted 
along the Southern California coastline as well, from Malibu to Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The largest concentration of bald eagles in California is in the Lower Klamath 
and Tule Lake wildlife refuges in Northern California -- home to about 500 
wintering birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Wildlife experts are troubled by their inability to predict at what point bald 
eagles will abandon an area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Throughout California, there is a growing trend to develop around 
reservoirs," Detrich said. "While we have not yet seen any use by eagles in 
those areas precluded because of that trend, I'd have to say we're on the 
threshold of accumulative effects. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is, we can't put our finger on that point when the threshold will 
be reached." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials are not just worried about losing roosting sites to development. 
Even the loss of individual trees used by bald eagles for daytime perching can 
be cause for concern. The eagles typically rest atop dead, foliage-free trees 
that offer them unencumbered views of potential prey. But homeowners cut these 
trees down because they are considered unattractive or a hazard, forcing the 
bald eagle to look for another perch. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler said the Forest Service can at least try to protect its land for bald 
eagles, and embarked on the trapping program so it can learn where the raptors 
spend their nights. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, one roost site, used by as many as a dozen eagles, has been 
identified, near where the Forest Service planned to construct a trail. That 
trail will now avoid the area, she said.

A FOOD OASIS IN A TIJUANA SHANTYTOWN; POVERTY: BILL ROLEY OF LAGUNA BEACH HELPS 
ABANDONED CHILDREN GROW A GARDEN OF HOPE AT THEIR SHELTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Just south of the international border lies an improbable oasis for abandoned 
children. In this six-acre haven are redolent edible gardens teeming with mint, 
rosemary, cilantro, cauliflower, and mango and orange trees, among other flora. 
</P>
<P>
 The beauty and aroma clash absurdly with the horrid smell of burning refuse 
rising from the shantytown just below, a barren place that a travel-weary 
Mother Teresa once observed had poverty she had "never seen anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 The Aldeas Infantiles shelter, one of the few green spots in this parched city 
of about 2 million people, is partly the creation of Bill Roley of Laguna 
Beach. He is an anthropologist, horticulturist and all-around ecologically and 
environmentally correct dynamo who prizes compost as much as he does the looks 
and life-giving quality of plants. 
</P>
<P>
 In this "museum of food," as Roley calls the shelter, he has turned loose his 
imagination, considerable green-thumb knowledge and academic experience to 
create what he hopes is a living model for a city beset by poverty and 
overpopulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Roley, the 46-year-old son of a Marine Corps colonel, is teaching the 
shelter's 22 children to become self-sufficient, to recycle nearly everything, 
and to teach others the value of seeds and soil. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is that they're responsible for the waste that comes out of their 
house and their kitchen; that they need to recycle it into compost," he said. 
"They're responsible for the chores around the kitchen, which has earth gardens 
that can be used (to grow) medicinal or culinary plants." 
</P>
<P>
 Victims of a "ruptured society," as Roley described them, the children living 
at the shelter are the products of broken homes, of adolescent mothers or 
abusive parents who abandoned them or were forced to give them up. 
</P>
<P>
 And here, in the rows of romaine and baby lettuce, parsnips and peppers, is 
where Roley believes their recovery lies, where hope is nurtured and their 
futures are forged. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to teach the children not only how to be emotionally strong, 
we're going to teach them how to be ecologically and environmentally strong," 
said Roley, who belongs to several ecological and educational organizations 
involved in the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, he said, the gardens will yield enough produce that the children 
will be able to establish a small store to sell the excess to the public. He 
said the shelter, shaded and protected from the elements by its greenery, will 
be more self-sufficient and less dependent on outside food sources and energy. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfonso Pulido, president of the foundation that runs the shelter, said the 
experiment is opening eyes in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shelter is a reality that must be shown to be believed," he said. "Once 
it was nothing more than a barren hill with buildings where nothing could grow. 
Now it is a miracle, an example of how the methods applied can work here." 
</P>
<P>
 Roley earned his doctorate in anthropology at UC Irvine in 1976. He teaches 
environmental planning at Cal State Fullerton and ecological survival at the 
Center for Regenerative Studies at Cal Poly Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Roley and his occasional business partner and ecological 
soul-mate, Scott Murray, were approached by the SOS Kinderdorf International 
Foundation. The organization -- which has created about 1,100 children's 
shelters throughout the world -- asked Murray and Roley to help beautify a new 
shelter in Tijuana for a $25,000 fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Kinderdorf wanted to use the ecological techniques developed by Roley and his 
Permaculture Institute of Southern California to design drainage channels, 
ecological landscaping, as well as six more houses to complement the seven 
existing homes. 
</P>
<P>
 When Roley and Murray first arrived at the site, they knew the job was not 
going to be easy. The foundations of the two-story homes had been damaged by 
rain. Moreover, tons of construction debris had been dumped at the edge of the 
property, creating a porous slope upon which rain had carved five-foot wide 
crevices, a clear sign of erosion. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Americans also realized that the site, about a mile uphill from 
Tijuana's Central Bus Depot, was particularly vulnerable to the wind as well as 
the noise created by the heavy traffic moving toward Otay Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the project turned into a labor of love for the two Americans. By 
their own account, their fee would, over the two years, work out to the 
equivalent of $1.50 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "The job mushroomed into a much larger job than we had committed to," said 
Roley. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the men found a few allies, including the Morelos State Park 
nursery as well as nurseries in Orange County, which donated several hundred 
trees. Tijuana's Caliente Racetrack donated several hundred tons of compost 
from its stalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Roley and Murray designed an intricate water harvesting system, reconditioned 
the soil, including the eroded slope, and planted citrus, olive, fig, banana, 
mango, palm and acacia trees, bougainvillea, vines, and a myriad of edible and 
medicinal plants. 
</P>
<P>
 They also established contact with an organization that was creating an 
eco-park near the shelter using recently developed water-treatment techniques. 
These ultimately may be used to create a permanent source of water for the 
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, they have helped create an environmental school at the site that 
is becoming a model for schools throughout the region, according to Roley and 
local officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "The school is becoming a magnet for environmental awareness. The ecological 
classroom is seen as a model for some of the things (Tijuanans) would like to 
do, things we have done here," Roley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray, who once ran a farm in Mexico that produced out-of-season fruits and 
vegetables for U.S. restaurants -- said that he and Roley were simply drawing 
on old techniques that they believe should be adopted by the city of Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're on the cutting edge of a 10,000-year-old technology," said Murray, who, 
during his college days at UC Santa Cruz back in the early 1970s, was one of 
the first to promote the idea of agro-ecology. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the pioneers of the sustainable future where things don't get 
progressively worse, they get better and better," he said. "We've tried to 
build something here that 20 years from now will be financially sustainable. 
We've established a system that will get better and better." 
</P>
<P>
 Although 22 children are housed at the shelter, about 100 more are expected 
within the next couple of years, said shelter director Guillermo Arriaga. It 
all depends on how fast the "dynamic duo" -- as Roley and Murray are called by 
their Mexican partners -- can gather volunteers and donations to finish the 
rest of the buildings and landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 Benito Espinoza Montalbo, a 9-year-old boy whose short stature and slight 
build belie his age, is among the smallest helpers. During a recent visit by 
the San Diego-based People for Trees organization, Benito was the first to 
volunteer in the planting of several trees brought by the group. 
</P>
<P>
 His story is not unlike the others' here. Abandoned by abusive parents two 
years ago in the town of Tehuacan, Puebla, he and his sister Liliana, 13, were 
picked up by Kinderdorf's Aldeas Infantiles in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 Benito said his parents "would beat us up with a (cord) or whatever else" they 
could find. He said he liked planting trees, the smell of the flowers he grows 
and the people who take care of him at the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Benito cannot forget his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to see her again; grow a flower and give it to her," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The aim of the Kinderdorf organization, created after World War II in Austria, 
is to raise not only single children, but to keep siblings together in a family 
atmosphere, according to Arriaga. Children like Benito and Liliana will stay 
together in the shelter until they reach maturity, he said.

ON CALIFORNIA: AT THE EDGE OF THE CITY SHE WAITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Janie Smith sells houses in the Antelope Valley. She works alone out of a 
model home at the corner of 36th West Street and Avenue J-2, a tract on the 
edge of town. The place is marked with nylon flags of faded red and a large 
sign: "Rainbow Homes." 
</P>
<P>
 The tract of 21 homes was built about five years ago. This was high tide for 
Southern California real estate, and the Antelope Valley seemed poised to take 
its place as the next extension of metropolitan Los Angeles. Out here, it was 
go, go, go. And then it stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could see it coming," Smith says. "All you had to do was fly over in a 
helicopter and look down at all the sticks." 
</P>
<P>
 The hammers fell silent and the customers stopped coming. Today, not far from 
the Rainbow Homes, the lonely, weathered frames -- the sticks -- of a block of 
unfinished houses loom as markers to the bust; the windows are broken and 
tumbleweeds have helped themselves inside. Smith has been hired to move the 12 
remaining Rainbows. "It's a bankruptcy deal," she says. Houses that went for 
$250,000 can now be had for about $100,000 less. Still, the going is slow. Last 
week, only 10 lookers came by Smith's office. Asked to describe the market, she 
doesn't require much time to measure a response. 
</P>
<P>
 "How," she asks, "does miserable sound?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Smith is 61 years old and has been selling real estate for three decades 
across Southern California's suburbs. Her hair and knit top match the Rainbow 
banners, and she also wears plain wool slacks and moccasins. No sense 
overdressing on this duty. As she talks, she walks through the tract, unlocking 
doors to empty houses. A couple has stopped to see the models. Smith is not 
sure how to read the pair. The tired-looking car is a bad sign, but the man's 
hand-held telephone is cause for hope. "We'll see," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith came to Lancaster from the Simi Valley. "When I first moved here," she 
says, "I thought, 'Who in their right mind would want to live this far out?' 
But the more people live here, the more they like it, and the more they like 
it, the less they mind the drive." She looks at your notebook as she says this. 
She is selling now. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course selling Lancaster requires, to a degree, an unselling of Los 
Angeles. Like most people here, Smith refers to Los Angeles as "down below." 
She insists the term is geographical, not metaphorical, but you wonder. Down 
below, Lancasters will tell you, is where crime rages and the air stinks. Down 
below also is where jobs are found and pay is better, and so they make their 
deal with the devil city and measure their drive time in hours, not minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 With the earthquake, the trip has become even more fiendish. The commuters 
flood out of the tracts in darkness, and still they back up for miles at the 
broken intersection of the Golden State and Antelope Valley freeways. Never has 
the Antelope Valley seemed so far from Los Angeles. It has created an impact on 
court business and hospital business and, it would seem inevitable, the real 
estate business. You offer the thesis that the earthquake has exposed the fact 
that the outward march of Los Angeles cannot go on forever, that there are 
limits to how far a city can be stretched. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith is not ready to buy. "None of us can quite seem to get a feel for what 
the earthquake will do, good or bad," she says. "It might be a positive. A lot 
of people lost their houses, you know. But I haven't got any business from it, 
yet. I do have one sale coming in from down below, but that" she adds 
offhandedly, "is the result of a drive-by shooting, not the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The lookers are back. The man stands before a color-coded tract map. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked the blue one," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "You mean teal," Smith corrects him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is the green one available?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mint green," she says. She is just being funny, but the man doesn't seem 
amused. She asks about prices. He responds with questions about plumbing and 
paint jobs. Before long they are gone. "I don't think so," Smith says. 
</P>
<P>
 She walks you out. "Thanks," she says, "for stopping to see us out here in the 
middle of nowhere." And then she laughs, waves and retreats to her office, 
waiting inside her Rainbow Home for the city to come to the desert.

TALBOTT FLAP: A TEMPEST IN A TEAPOT?; GOVERNMENT: CLINTON FRIEND'S CONFIRMATION 
AS DEPUTY SECRETARY OF STATE IS IN NO REAL DANGER. BUT SOME STICKY QUESTIONS 
MAY BE ASKED AT THE HEARING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When President Clinton chose his old Oxford roommate, former Time magazine 
correspondent Strobe Talbott, to be the State Department's No. 2 official, it 
was not supposed to be a controversial appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "An inspired choice," glowed House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.). "A 
gifted strategic thinker," said Secretary of State Warren Christopher, who saw 
Talbott as a secret weapon to turn Clinton's attention to foreign policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Talbott was credited with playing a large part in two of the 
Administration's success stories: its aid program for Russia and its agreement 
to eliminate nuclear weapons from Ukraine. Some officials even spoke of him as 
a future secretary of state. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, as the Senate prepares to debate Talbott's nomination this week, 
Clinton's old friend suddenly has become a lightning rod for criticism. A 
growing list of detractors is hurling a variety of charges Talbott's way: that 
he failed to save reform in Russia, that he harbors harshly anti-Israel views, 
even that he was to blame for Clinton's abortive nomination of Bobby Ray Inman 
as secretary of defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been giving the President very bad advice," complained Sen. John McCain 
(R-Ariz.), a leading conservative spokesman on foreign policy. "He doesn't have 
the qualifications for the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Talbott's confirmation as deputy secretary of state is in no real danger. 
"He'll be confirmed overwhelmingly," acknowledged McCain, who is leading the 
opposition to the nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the tempest over Talbott is one part foreign policy debate, largely 
over Clinton's policy of unreserved support for Russian President Boris N. 
Yeltsin; one part political sparring, as Republicans probe to see whether 
Clinton is vulnerable to charges of foreign policy failure, and one part 
Washington ordeal, as interest groups and congressional players sink their 
teeth into every key nominee. 
</P>
<P>
 In Talbott's case, the stakes are high because of the widespread belief that, 
as one of Clinton's closest confidants, he may be the most powerful deputy 
secretary of state in memory -- and a possible successor to Christopher. 
</P>
<P>
 And it represents the opening salvo in a debate over Clinton's foreign policy 
performance, launched by Republicans such as McCain who hope to make it an 
issue in the 1996 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department spokesman Mike McCurry dismissed the complaints. "A majority 
of the Senate has already . . . greeted this nomination very favorably," he 
said Friday. Talbott has refused to reply publicly to his critics. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he will clearly face some stiff questions from the Senate Foreign 
Relations Committee when it considers his nomination Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 One focus of controversy is Russia, a subject on which Talbott made his name 
in both journalism and diplomacy. Last year, he successfully launched a massive 
U.S. aid program and marshaled support for Yeltsin. But last month, his 
policies suffered a serious setback when Moscow's leading economic reformers 
resigned. One, former Finance Minister Boris G. Fyodorov, even accused Talbott 
of delivering "a stab in the back" by saying that the United States would 
accept a slower pace of reform -- or, as Talbott put it, "less shock and more 
therapy." 
</P>
<P>
 A second controversy arose last week over several of Talbott's columns in Time 
on the Middle East during the 1980s. The leader of a conservative Jewish 
organization, Morton A. Klein, circulated a collection of excerpts from the 
columns and charged Talbott with "unbelievable hostility." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Talbott's columns were, indeed, critical of Israel -- mostly of 
Israel's hard-line Likud government in the 1980s. One, written during the 
Persian Gulf War, bore the incendiary headline, "How Israel Is Like Iraq." The 
column itself said, "In most respects, the comparison is as invalid as it is 
invidious." But it argued that Likud's goal of annexing the occupied West Bank 
was an obstacle to peace just as Iraq's attempt to annex Kuwait was. 
</P>
<P>
 That alarmed the leaders of many Jewish groups, and on Thursday, Lester 
Pollack, chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major American Jewish 
Organizations, met with Talbott for 90 minutes. In a written statement, Pollack 
said that Talbott "indicated his unqualified support for the Clinton 
Administration's policies . . . (of) support of Israel." But Pollack was not 
fully reassured, another Jewish official said. 
</P>
<P>
 McCurry said that the State Department had no qualms about Talbott's columns. 
"His role as a journalist and as a commentator was to be provocative and to be 
thoughtful. His role as a government official is to execute the policy of the 
United States government. And those are two different things," he said.

U.S. ASKS ALLIES TO ACT QUICKLY ON NATO PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ART PINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration sought Saturday to maintain the momentum of its new 
"Partnership for Peace" program, urging U.S. allies to move ahead quickly on 
setting up machinery to enable new Eastern European democracies to take part in 
NATO exercises. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving at a two-day conference of European defense ministers here, U.S. 
Defense Secretary William J. Perry called on NATO countries to take "vigorous, 
concrete actions" to provide facilities and training for former Warsaw Pact 
military units. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry told a news conference late Saturday that now that the program has been 
formally adopted by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, it is "urgent that 
we get on with the task of creating (it) . . . brick by brick. I am here this 
week to begin that process." 
</P>
<P>
 He also sought to assure America's Western European allies that despite 
Washington's public optimism about developments in Russia, the Administration 
is aware that the situation there could sour quickly and that it is beginning 
to grapple with what to do should that occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry's appearance at this weekend's conference marked his first foreign trip 
as defense secretary. The 66-year-old former Stanford University professor was 
sworn in Thursday night to succeed Les Aspin, who had held the post for a year. 
Perry had been Aspin's deputy secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to attending the meeting, Perry also held private talks Saturday 
with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl; Volker Ruehe, the German defense minister; 
Rudolf Scharping, Kohl's possible rival in upcoming elections, and Malcolm 
Rifkin, the British defense minister. Perry will speak at the security session 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry's message was aimed at dealing with two problems: a suspicion by Eastern 
Europeans that the Partnership for Peace program is only a political cover for 
refusing them immediate NATO membership, and a fear by Western Europeans that 
Washington is unrealistic about the outlook in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the partnership program, unveiled by President Clinton at a NATO summit 
in Brussels last month, Eastern European democracies would be permitted to take 
part in some special activities with NATO units but would not be allowed to 
join NATO immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 To date, only four Eastern European countries -- Poland, Romania, Estonia and 
Lithuania -- have signed up for the program, but Perry said that he expects a 
dozen more to join in the weeks ahead.

STRIKERS IN PAKISTAN SHOW KASHMIR MUSLIMS SUPPORT; ASIA: THE GOVERNMENT-BACKED 
ACTION DEMONSTRATES SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE BATTLING INDIAN RULE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A government-backed general strike in Pakistan paralyzed businesses, bazaars 
and factories Saturday as Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto and her citizenry 
demonstrated massive solidarity with fellow Muslims battling Indian rule in 
Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shutdown is total," Razia Bhatti of the current affairs magazine Newsline 
reported by telephone from Karachi, Pakistan's largest city and home to 6.7 
million people. "Everything is closed." 
</P>
<P>
 In the port city on the Arabian Sea, thousands of irate demonstrators burned 
Indian leaders in effigy and tried to storm India's consulate, but were kept 
several blocks away by rings of barbed wire and a cordon of jeeps equipped with 
machine guns. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, police armed with rifles and metal-covered batons waded into the 
crowd and opened fire with tear gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Halim Saddiqi, an opposition lawmaker in the National Assembly, was quoted by 
the Associated Press as saying that police resorted to the gas without being 
provoked by demonstrators. At least four activists were injured, and there were 
some arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 Public buses and rickshaws stood idle in Karachi, and workers' hotels, 
tearooms, offices, shops and industries shut their doors. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-day strike was similarly observed in the rest of the country, news 
reports said. In Islamabad, the Pakistani capital, hundreds of protesters 
burned tires outside the Indian Embassy, reports said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the frontier city of Peshawar near the Khyber Pass, demonstrators 
reportedly demanded a holy war to liberate Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
 A message issued by Bhutto said Pakistan would continue to extend all moral, 
political and diplomatic assistance to the people of Kashmir to allow them to 
achieve their goal of self-determination. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Indian side of the frontier, a large and hostile crowd assembled at the 
border checkpoint at Wagha, about 100 yards from Pakistan, to denounce the 
neighboring country's "conspiracy" against India and reject charges of 
widespread human rights abuses in Kashmir. 
</P>
<P>
 M.S. Bitta, president of the youth wing of India's ruling Congress-I Party and 
organizer of the counter-rally in Punjab, accused Bhutto of supporting 
anti-Indian terrorism, and blamed the United States and Pakistan for whipping 
up trouble in Kashmir and Punjab. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are really moved by the suffering people are undergoing, then save 
your tears for the poor, hungry and exploited mass of women and children in 
your own country," Bitta said in an open letter to Bhutto. News reports said up 
to 30,000 people came to shout anti-Bhutto slogans and to burn the Pakistani 
leader in effigy. 
</P>
<P>
 About two-thirds of the old Himalayan principality of Kashmir is controlled by 
India, with the rest in Pakistan's hands. Jammu and Kashmir is India's only 
state where Muslims are in the majority, and its status has long been the chief 
bone of contention in Indo-Pakistani relations. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent U.S. State Department report on human rights in India found abuses in 
Kashmir to be "particularly acute." Militants and civilians are summarily 
executed, and often are tortured while in custody, it said.

AMERICAN PARACHUTIST DROPS IN ON BUCKINGHAM PALACE

<P>
 An American paraglider swooped down onto the roof of Buckingham Palace on 
Saturday, heckling police along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 James Miller, who staged a similar prank at a Las Vegas boxing match last 
year, was hauled off to jail soon after he landed his propeller-driven 
parachute.He faced six charges of violating public order and air regulations, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Queen Elizabeth II was not home and missed the spectacle as Miller landed on 
her roof, stripped off his pants and revealed that he was painted green from 
the waist down. Police said he ran toward a flagpole above the palace entrance 
and taunted them. 
</P>
<P>
 He was unarmed, and no member of the Royal Family was in danger, Scotland Yard 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police spotted Miller as he flew along the River Thames and then down The 
Mall, the broad, tree-lined avenue between Trafalgar Square and the palace. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, 30, interrupted the Evander Holyfield-Riddick Bowe heavyweight title 
bout in Las Vegas on Nov. 6 by floating into the open-air arena on a 
paraglider. He was charged with a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Miller, who calls himself "the fan man," buzzed the Los Angeles 
Coliseum during a game between the Raiders and the Denver Broncos.

OUTSIDE A MORGUE 'PACKED TO DOORS,' SHRIEKS OF GRIEF

<TEXT>
<P>
 A trail of blood marked the progress of a stretcher toward the operating rooms 
of Kosevo Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The monotonous beep of a life-support machine announced yet another 
death.Corridors were lined with stretchers of the wounded, the dying and the 
dead, victims of the shelling Saturday of Sarajevo's main marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 "The morgue is packed to the doors," morgue official Hamid Dzindo said. "We 
are stacking the corpses." Burials will begin today, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 In one corridor of the hospital, 75-year-old Dzanko Pusko lay on a blood-caked 
stretcher gasping, "Help me, help me!" His legs were severely mangled from the 
shrapnel that had ripped through the market stalls. 
</P>
<P>
 He screamed in pain as nurses hoisted him onto a hospital trolley. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the morgue, cries and shrieks rose from a crowd of hundreds as a 
hospital official read out names of at least 50 people killed in the attack. 
The death toll was still rising as night fell. Officials later reported 66 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
 When the pitiful roll call concluded, some in the crowd wandered off toward 
adjacent hospital buildings, still hoping for good news. 
</P>
<P>
 They were met by horrific scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency room doctors, their white coats splattered with blood, yelled 
instructions as they rushed to grab gauze, medicines and bandages just 
delivered by the International Red Cross and other foreign aid groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where's the reason behind such mass murder and slaughter of civilians?" asked 
Ivica Pranjic, a doctor in the emergency room. 
</P>
<P>
 At that moment, a NATO warplane monitoring a U.N.-imposed "no-fly" zone over 
Bosnia swooped low past the hospital. A nurse rushed out of an operating 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are you doing here?" she screamed at the jet. "Where were you when this 
happened? Go away!"

NEWS ANALYSIS; IN BULGARIA, LOOKING BACK WITH LONGING; EASTERN EUROPE: A NATION 
IN CRISIS YEARNS FOR THE 'GOOD OLD DAYS' OF COMMUNIST RULE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than four years into an economic free fall, Bulgaria has yet to hit the 
bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 The economy has contracted sharply in each of the years since Communist leader 
Todor Zhivkov was overthrown in a bloodless coup. Unemployment is 16% and 
rising. Inflation topped 60% last year. Foreign investment has been a pittance, 
and the country is $13 billion in debt. 
</P>
<P>
 By every political and economic measure, Bulgaria is in crisis and there is no 
end in sight to its troubles. Living conditions are so much worse in the reform 
era that Bulgarians look back fondly on communism's "good old days," when the 
hand of the state crushed personal freedom but ensured that people were housed, 
employed and had enough to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 A Western diplomat posted in Sofia predicted that if a vote were held in the 
next few months, Bulgarians would replay the "Poland scenario," reelecting 
former Communists in a desperate attempt to reclaim the past. 
</P>
<P>
 The Parliament is split between the ever-so-slightly reformed Socialist Party 
and a 16-group coalition known as the Union of Democratic Forces. Neither group 
commands a majority, which has allowed the small Movement for Rights and 
Freedom, representing Bulgaria's ethnic Turks, to play kingmaker, shifting 
support from left to right as priorities dictate and undermining governments. 
</P>
<P>
 The hopelessly divided Parliament has proved incapable of producing reform 
legislation needed to win foreign investors' confidence. And a dispute over the 
need for early elections may leave the paralyzed legislature in power through 
the October, 1995, expiration of its current mandate, ensuring the status quo 
of a collapsing economy and stagnant investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The general stumbling block is political instability," Georgi Shivarov of the 
Bulgarian Industrial Assn. said of the lack of foreign investment, which since 
1989 has totaled $260 million -- less than 4% of the amount invested in Hungary 
over the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 Bulgaria's proximity to the raging Yugoslav wars is also scaring away 
investors, Shivarov said. 
</P>
<P>
 Interim Prime Minister Lyuben Berov, a nonpartisan historian, is the fourth 
man to head the government since multi-party elections in 1990. He was chosen 
by the Socialists and the Movement for Rights and Freedom to serve as a 
caretaker until new elections but has already held office for 14 months while 
the parties bicker endlessly and veto each other's bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The result has been paralysis in institutions of power, leaving Bulgaria's 8.5 
million residents to fend for themselves in a system where social security was 
an early victim of mismanaged reform. Crime and corruption are flourishing, as 
made evident by a mid-January fatal shootout between two gangs of police 
officers in downtown Sofia. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like Chicago in the 1920s!" bemoaned laid-off truck driver Stoyan Totev. 
"Maybe we had some problems under communism, but it wasn't so dangerous as this 
so-called democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Polls suggest that Bulgarians are undecided about which political force holds 
the best prospects for their future, having seen living conditions erode under 
both Socialist and Union-led governments. Apathy afflicts much of the 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the reforms have been made according to shock therapy theories, and 
this has created strong opposition in the population," Socialist leader Jean 
Videnov said. "People are very bitter about it, and we think they are going to 
vote for our more balanced approach."

COOPER PITCHES HEALTH PLAN TO PEROT; LEGISLATION: THE TENNESSEE POLITICIAN 
TELLS UNITED WE STAND THAT HIS MODEL WILL INVOLVE LESS COST, BUREAUCRACY THAN 
CLINTON'S PROPOSAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SHOGAN, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seeking to add to the momentum behind his model for health care reform, Rep. 
Jim Cooper (D-Tenn.) on Saturday told followers of Ross Perot that his plan 
will offer nearly as many benefits as President Clinton's proposal, but with 
less cost and with less bureaucratic control. 
</P>
<P>
 He also called his proposal "the best starting point to achieve national 
consensus on this complex issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper's appearance, which was warmly received by leaders of the 
Perot-sponsored organization, United We Stand, America, Inc. came hard on the 
heels of his plan's endorsement by the Business Roundtable, which represents 
approximately 200 of the nation's largest companies. 
</P>
<P>
 While no specific endorsement was sought nor made, Cooper seemed to have made 
a strong impression on Perot. The Texas billionaire vaulted to the stage after 
Cooper had finished his talk to praise his "street-smart common sense" and his 
willingness to challenge Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper's 20-minute luncheon speech appeared to appeal to the group's 
acknowledged mistrust of the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 While pointing out that his proposal was similar to Clinton's in that both 
relied on "managed competition" to hold down costs, the congressman said the 
two plans differed significantly in their view of government. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally speaking, the White House favors a big-government approach," Cooper 
said. "Our bill tries to keep government to an absolute minimum." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper also said that his bill, unlike the President's proposal, would not 
require employers to provide insurance coverage for their workers, which 
Clinton views as an important component in reaching his goal of providing 
universal health care coverage for all Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper claimed that his "user-friendly" plan would achieve that goal without 
the mandated coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no reason why everyone won't be covered with these reforms" by 1998, 
the target date set by Clinton, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper also stressed his claim that his plan would bring added tax benefits to 
workers in return for reducing the tax deductions that corporations can take 
for providing health insurance to workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The cut in these deductions, along with Medicare cuts of $40 billion over five 
years, would help pay much of the cost of Cooper's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Under current law, as Cooper pointed out, only corporations can fully deduct 
the cost of health coverage. Unlike the Clinton plan, which would give that 
benefit to the self-employed but not to employees, Cooper would allow the 
average wage-earner to deduct the cost of a basic health plan from his taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper, who is running for the Senate seat vacated by Vice President Al Gore 
in Tennessee, was given an ovation for the pledge he made two years ago not to 
take campaign contributions from political action committees. 
</P>
<P>
 But Citizen Action, a Washington-based consumer group, claims that Cooper 
received $365,000 in large-donor contributions from individuals affiliated with 
the health care industry, or 27% of his total of $1.3 million in large-donor 
contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly Rep. Jim Cooper's legislation will benefit the very interests from 
whom he receives so much money," said Michael Podhorzer, Citizen Action 
campaigns director. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper's own campaign claims that out of $1.791 million in contributions 
received in 1993, only $320,000, or 17%, came from people linked to the health 
care industry, according to Murfy Alexander, his press secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander said Cooper rejects PAC contributions because PACs usually have "a 
single agenda," while individuals have "much broader reasons" for making 
contributions.

GLOBAL JOB SUMMIT SET FOR DETROIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton will hold an international job summit in Detroit next month 
to tackle the global problem of persistently high unemployment, the White House 
announced Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said in a statement that the March 14-15 
conference will bring together economic, labor, finance and industry ministers 
from the Group of Seven industrialized democracies: the United States, Canada, 
Germany, Italy, Japan, France and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 A White House message sent to the other governments said Detroit was "a 
working city that has embraced change, met the challenges of technology, and 
lives and dies by international trade." 
</P>
<P>
 "Holding the jobs conference in Detroit will send a message that we intend to 
confront the challenge of job creation and unemployment, not retreat to the 
economic structures of yesterday," it said. 
</P>
<P>
 During a G-7 meeting last July in Tokyo, Clinton announced his intention to 
convene such a conference. He said the G-7 officials would "search for the 
causes and possible answers for this stubbornly high unemployment." 
</P>
<P>
 "There are things each of us can do within our nation, and (if) we do it 
together, that will help us not just to grow the economy but to ensure that 
economic growth means more jobs for Americans and more jobs for the world," 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said in July that leaders of other industrialized democracies "are as 
frustrated as I am that no matter what they seem to do for their economy, the 
jobs aren't coming along." 
</P>
<P>
 There has been some improvement in the U.S. jobless picture since then.

GLITCHES DELAY SHUTTLE SATELLITE RELEASE; SPACE: TROUBLE WITH RADIO 
INTERFERENCE AND GLARE FROM THE SUN THWART DEPLOYMENT OF THE EXPERIMENTAL 
DEVICE. THE CREW WILL TRY AGAIN TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NASA scrapped plans to release an experimental science satellite from the 
shuttle Discovery on Saturday after struggling for hours to overcome problems 
caused by radio interference and glare from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 After advising commander Charles Bolden Jr. to get a pencil to write down 
instructions -- "you may also need some aspirin" -- Mission Control informed 
him that flight directors were giving up for the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that they would try again today to release the satellite. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's an excellent plan," Bolden said. 
</P>
<P>
 The satellite, a 12-foot stainless steel disk called the Wake Shield Facility, 
was supposed to fly free of the shuttle for two days. Researchers wanted to see 
if superior semiconductor films would grow in its ultra-pure wake. 
</P>
<P>
 Flight director Gary Coen said other experiments planned for the mission would 
be curtailed or eliminated because of the delay in releasing the satellite but 
that the craft, once deployed, would remain out for two days as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Discovery does not have enough fuel to extend its flight, officials said. The 
eight-day mission is due to end Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble began soon after astronaut Jan Davis used the shuttle's robot arm 
to lift the Wake Shield from Discovery's cargo bay. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Wake Shield dangled overboard on the end of the arm, allowing the rush 
of atomic oxygen to clean the extremely contamination-sensitive craft, the five 
status lights on the satellite appeared to keep going off. The lights are 
supposed to indicate the status of electricity and computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
 No sooner had Mission Control traced that problem to a bad battery and 
switched to a backup than the satellite's two transmitters appeared to go out. 
</P>
<P>
 As the problems mounted, NASA passed on the second release opportunity and 
then again on the third and final opportunity of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 A Wake Shield manager, Alex Ignatiev, said the lights and battery apparently 
were never a problem. Glare from the sun made it hard to distinguish whether 
the lights were on or off, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the transmission trouble, on-board radio interference was the likely 
culprit, Ignatiev said. The crew should be able to eliminate it by simply 
readjusting the position of the satellite on the end of the arm, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the satellite is not released, Discovery's cosmonaut, Sergei Krikalev, will 
lose his big chance to pluck the satellite from orbit. Krikalev, the first 
Russian to fly on a U.S. shuttle, has spent much of the past year practicing 
with the robot arm to accomplish that task. 
</P>
<P>
 The $13.5-million satellite, built and managed by the University of Houston 
and Space Industries Inc. of Houston, is flying in space for the first time. 
Before the mission, researchers involved in the project cautioned that 
something might go wrong because such an experiment has never been tried. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the investigators is Discovery astronaut Ronald Sega, a physicist and 
engineer who also is flying in space for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Aeronautics and Space Administration plans to fly the Wake Shield 
on four missions.

MINTZ, MORIAL FACE RUNOFF IN NEW ORLEANS MAYORAL RACE; POLITICS: NAME-CALLING, 
FRAUD CHARGES AND AN 11TH-HOUR INDICTMENT OF A CAMPAIGN AIDE SPICED UP THE 
BAYOU BATTLE AMONG THE 10 CANDIDATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Attorney Donald Mintz and state Sen. Marc Morial will meet in a runoff next 
month after they received the most votes Saturday in the city's bitterly 
contested mayoral race. 
</P>
<P>
 With all precincts reporting, Mintz, who finished a close second in the 1990 
mayoral election, received 37% of the votes cast. Morial, the son of the city's 
first black mayor, Ernest (Dutch) Morial, was second with 32%. Eight other 
candidates were running far behind. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of the March 5 runoff will replace Mayor Sidney Barthelemy, who was 
barred from seeking a third four-year term. A runoff will be necessary because 
no candidate received more than 50% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The election followed a campaign characterized by charges of fraud and 
name-calling that seemed extreme even in a city known for its hard-boiled 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 In the waning days of the campaign, several candidates joined with the local 
district attorney's office in asking for an investigation of thousands of 
pieces of campaign literature filled with racist, anti-gay and anti-Semitic 
language. 
</P>
<P>
 State Rep. Mitch Landrieu, a mayoral candidate and the son of former New 
Orleans Mayor Maurice (Moon) Landrieu, had attacked the pamphlets as "hateful 
and mean-spirited." Landrieu finished third in Saturday's voting. 
</P>
<P>
 Mintz, who is white, on Friday dismissed a top aide who was indicted for 
distributing anonymous, and therefore illegal, campaign literature. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment did not specify which flyer the aide allegedly distributed. 
Under Louisiana law, it is a misdemeanor to fail to identify the source of 
campaign material. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the campaign literature controversy erupted, the mayoral race centered 
on what to do about the city's deadly pace of violence -- which resulted in 389 
murders last year, a 36% increase from the previous year -- and how to 
invigorate a stagnant economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates varied little in their philosophical approach to government or 
in their proposed solutions to the city's crime problems. All promised to beef 
up the police force and push for tougher sentencing for repeat felons. 
</P>
<P>
 On the economy, the candidates had long ago abandoned debating the merits of 
the soon-to-open Grand Palais casino -- which promoters say will provide up to 
20,000 jobs -- in favor of promising to wisely spend the more than $10 million 
in rent the facility is expected to generate each year. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the city will benefit from added tax revenues because of the 
casino. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the size of the election field and the amount of money spent on radio 
and TV advertising exceeded levels spent in recent campaigns, analysts said the 
battle may have ultimately boiled down to name recognition and the personality 
of the candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only Mintz and Morial have run citywide races before, so they are the best 
known and organized," said John Grimm, president of a local polling company. 
</P>
<P>
 The race was an open primary, meaning that members of any party could run. But 
eight of the 10 candidates ran as Democrats and the other two as independents. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has a 62% black electorate. Seven candidates were black.

U.S. PROBES DISPARITY BETWEEN FIRING OF MINORITIES, WHITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has launched an extensive inquiry to try to 
determine why minority employees in the federal government are fired at almost 
three times the rate of white workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The government-wide inquiry will rely on analytical studies, focus groups and 
agency reviews to try to explain the disparity.One personnel specialist said he 
had never seen such a broad attack focused on such a specific personnel issue 
in his 30-year government career. 
</P>
<P>
 Government statistics, released in mid-December, showed that minority workers 
were fired at a rate of 10.2 per 1,000 employees, while whites were fired at a 
rate of 3.7 per 1,000 workers. The fiscal 1992 data raised concerns about 
whether minority workers are treated unfairly and led to calls for remedial 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 By better understanding the difference in discharge rates, "we can devise 
actions to ensure continuing fairness for all employees," James B. King, 
director of the Office of Personnel Management, said in a memo sent to all 
departments and agency heads. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency, which oversees the civil service employment system, will provide 
agencies with data on their firing rates. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memo released Friday, King also said the Merit Systems Protection Board, 
the federal agency that rules on worker appeals of personnel actions, also has 
begun a study. It will focus on "whether there are attitudinal or other 
non-merit related causes which may underline the racially disparate imposition 
of punishments," King wrote.

GARAMENDI ENDORSES GROUP'S IMMIGRANTS RIGHTS BLUEPRINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK J. McDONNELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Expressing fear that the immigration debate could unleash racism, 
gubernatorial candidate John Garamendi on Saturday endorsed a series of 
principles championed by a coalition of Latino lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, California's insurance commissioner, announced in Los Angeles that 
he backs the immigrants rights blueprint of a group known as Proponents for 
Responsible Immigration Debate and Education (PRIDE), made up of officeholders 
and community organizations. The coalition, formed in December, seeks to 
influence public discussions about immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an extraordinarily dangerous issue," Garamendi said after emerging 
from a coalition meeting at the Downtown Los Angeles headquarters of the 
Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. "It can turn loose in our 
society the rabid dog of racism." 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition members in attendance included Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los Angeles), 
Los Angeles County Supervisor Gloria Molina, Assemblyman Richard Polanco (D-Los 
Angeles) and Assemblywoman Martha M. Escutia (D-Huntington Park). 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to counter immigrant-bashing, the lawmakers plan to ask all 
California gubernatorial and U.S. Senate candidates to affirm four broad 
principles: 
</P>
<P>
 * The right of U.S. citizenship for everyone born in the United States, 
regardless of their parents' immigration status. Non-citizens should also be 
encouraged to sign up for citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 * Access for all immigrants -- including the undocumented -- to elementary and 
secondary education, emergency medical care and health services. 
</P>
<P>
 * Enforcement of U.S. borders must remain a civilian task -- not a military 
function -- and should be conducted in a humane fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fostering democracy abroad and providing economic assistance to Mexico and 
other "sender" nations are the most effective ways to cut down on illegal 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 In a meeting last month, Gov. Pete Wilson endorsed two of the four principles: 
maintaining civilian border control and giving economic help to immigrants' 
homelands. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Wilson also backs denying U.S. citizenship to children born here to 
illegal immigrants. And the governor is opposed to providing health care and 
other public benefits to immigrants in the country illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Coalition members plan to meet next week with California Treasurer Kathleen 
Brown, who is also expected to run for governor.

SIDNEY WILLIAMS' UNUSUAL ROUTE TO AMBASSADOR POST; APPOINTMENTS: HIS NOMINATION 
HAS DRAWN SOME CRITICS. BUT HIS BIGGEST BOOST MAY COME FROM HIS WIFE, REP. 
MAXINE WATERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Car dealer is not the normal career path to foreign service, but if Sidney 
Williams prevails, he will go from being a Mercedes-Benz dealer in Hollywood to 
being the U.S. ambassador to the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
 At 51, Williams has been a lot of other things, too: former professional 
football player (Cleveland Browns, Washington Redskins), aide and chief of 
staff to former Los Angeles City Councilman David Cunningham, a minority 
business developer with former teammate Jim Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it comes to ambassadorial appointments, perhaps his most influential 
credential is that of husband to Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles), one of 
President Clinton's earliest and most prominent black supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Most congressional observers believe that Williams, who has won committee 
approval, will be confirmed when the Senate votes on his nomination in the next 
few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Williams is getting a lesson in how Washington works. Every time 
a president takes office he can count on a few of his ambassadorial nominees 
causing a tussle with the opposition party, and Williams is among four being 
targeted this time. The rumblings about Williams, one of two Los Angeles 
residents to be nominated for an ambassadorship (California Secretary of State 
March Fong Eu was nominated last week to be ambassador to Micronesia), are the 
classic ones that dog many presidents' political nominees for ambassadorships. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best justification that he has for being ambassador is that he traveled 
to the Bahamas on vacation," said one congressional aide familiar with 
Williams' confirmation process. 
</P>
<P>
 His backers say that is a cheap shot and point out that many political 
appointees blossom into fine ambassadors. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department, which issued a report on Williams to the Senate, said 
his background would serve him well in the diplomatic corps: "Mr. Williams 
developed strong discipline, strategic thinking and negotiating skills as a 
professional football player." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Waters and Williams, they're not talking. "The strict instructions from 
the State Department are to stay out of the newspapers until after he's 
confirmed," said Waters, declining to relay a message to her husband. "He's not 
running for a beauty contest." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Waters has made sure that the right people know how she feels. Last 
February, Waters wrote to Bruce Lindsey, senior adviser and assistant to the 
President for personnel: "This letter is to alert you of my support of Sidney 
Williams for the position of Ambassador to the Commonwealth of the Bahamas," 
reads the first line. "Sidney's public relations and diplomatic skills have 
been well honed over the years." Only in the fourth sentence does she let slip 
the detail of their relationship: "Sidney Williams, who is my spouse, was a 
professional football player for the Cleveland Browns and Washington Redskins." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, a Shreveport, La., native, married Waters in 1977 and was at her 
side as she rose to political prominence, first in the state Assembly and then 
in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always admired him because she's very flamboyant, and I've never sensed 
in him any insecurity," said Jim Brown, the former football player, who has 
known Williams since they played for the Cleveland Browns in the mid-1960s. 
"That can be difficult for many men -- to have a flamboyant, dynamic wife." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown and Williams, a former linebacker, played on the 1965 Cleveland Browns 
NFL championship team. "He was a really good football player," said Brown, one 
of the greatest running backs to play the game, who now works with gang members 
and on gang-related issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who has two stepchildren, worked with Brown from 1966 to 1974 on the 
Black Economic Union, a now-defunct organization that Brown started to help 
develop minority businesses. Brown describes Williams as detail-oriented, 
methodical and tenacious. "For example, he decided to lose weight and he just 
did it," Brown recalled. "He lost like 30 pounds. He's small now. No one ever 
realized it, but he was really big." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams worked for former Los Angeles City Councilman David Cunningham in the 
mid-1970s, overlapping at one point with Maxine Waters. The two were not 
married at the time but they were dating, as far as Cunningham can recall. She 
was chief of staff until her departure in 1976, when she was elected to the 
state Assembly. Williams became chief of staff shortly afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was also a project manager for the Los Angeles Community 
Redevelopment Agency in the late 1970s. But in 1979, he switched gears and went 
to work at the Mercedes-Benz dealership.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you had an opportunity to enhance your income significantly through . . . 
commissions versus a salary of $50,000, wouldn't you take it?" asked 
Cunningham, who is now a lobbyist. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the sleek, rounded walls of the Sunset Boulevard showroom -- which 
looks more like an art gallery than a car dealership -- Williams racked up more 
than 1,000 clients in 14 years, according to his friend and fellow dealer Andre 
Dawson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ninety percent of his business was repeat business," said Dawson, whom 
Williams helped install as his replacement at the dealership. "He didn't take a 
lot of traffic off the floor." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 None of his friends or supporters see the transition from car salesman to 
ambassador as an insurmountable leap for Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not a car salesman," Cunningham said. "When you talk about Mercedes, 
BMWs, Rolls Royces, you're not talking about car salesmen. As Sidney would say, 
'It's not really a car that you sell. You act as a sales representative who 
helps people make decisions about the type of Mercedes they wish to acquire.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the sort of guy who should be an ambassador," said Dawson, who remembers 
teasing Williams because he often wore that sartorial emblem of the East Coast 
Establishment: a bow tie. "He's kind of reserved, rather conservative . . . I'm 
a little more aggressive than I have to be. He's real cool and confident. He's 
like a Clint Eastwood character. If you got this guy upset, you would never 
know it." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlton Jenkins, president of Founders National Bank of Los Angeles, the only 
black-owned bank in California, noted that Williams had gone out of his way to 
get the dealership to replace him with an African American. "He's opened the 
door to a lot of African Americans," Jenkins said, "as well as put a lot of 
Mercedes on the street for African Americans . . . I think he's been a positive 
African American male role model." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to friends, he's already the consummate diplomat, even on the golf 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 "He might say, 'Hey, buddy, I don't want to mess up your game but it looks 
like you're not getting back to your left side,' " Cunningham said. 
</P>
<P>
 The former councilman and Williams are members of a golf club of black 
professional men who call themselves the Funlovers and have a standing date to 
play every Sunday at the Montebello Municipal Golf Course. Williams has not 
made many of the past Sundays because he has been shuttling between Los Angeles 
and Washington, where he is being briefed on ambassadorial duties. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call him Mr. Ambassador," laughed Kenneth Collins, an attorney and the 
president of the golf club. "His response is that that's a little premature." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was one of four recent nominees criticized by some Republicans on the 
Senate Foreign Relations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are certainly excellent Americans," said Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Indiana) 
in a committee meeting. "But there is very little in the record or in their 
testimony that would lead one to believe that they have the competence, really, 
to deal with the problems our country has with these very important countries." 
</P>
<P>
 The White House has filled about 100 ambassadorial posts, but it has more than 
three dozen to fill. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams has only one hurdle left to clear. He survived a November Senate 
committee confirmation hearing -- which lasted a scant 20 minutes -- with a 
performance that by some accounts was lackluster but free of gaffes. There was 
a question from Sen. Christopher Dodd (D-Conn.) about what kind of car he would 
be driving in the Bahamas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am really looking at purchasing a Chevrolet, sir," Williams said to 
laughter, noting that he had divested himself of his Mercedes. But he was not 
too expansive on drug trafficking and trade issues, the main points of interest 
between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was nervous," said Dodd, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations 
Committee, sympathetically. Dodd has confessed to initial doubts about 
Williams' candidacy. Dodd said over the course of several private meetings, 
Williams was impressive and won over the senator's skeptical staffers. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of this is people skills," said Dodd, whose committee approved the 
nomination 14 to 6 and sent it on to the Senate floor. "The idea that you have 
to have a Ph.D. in foreign affairs is not true. Some of our best ambassadors 
have been political appointees." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the grumbling of some Republicans on Capitol Hill, Williams has run 
into nothing like the opposition to another Californian ambassadorial nominee, 
M. Larry Lawrence, owner of the Hotel del Coronado in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence, one of the Democratic Party's major contributors and the nominee to 
Switzerland, has drawn strong opposition from the American Foreign Service 
Assn., the union representing government foreign service employees. The group 
has made much of the fact that Lawrence does not know any of the official 
languages of Switzerland (although he is learning French.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Larry Lawrence represents something we should not be encouraging -- the 
purchasing of an embassy," said Dennis Kux, a member of the American Foreign 
Service Assn.'s board. 
</P>
<P>
 White House and congressional supporters dismiss his critics, calling Lawrence 
a sophisticated and successful businessman who has had numerous dealings with 
Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
 One of only a handful of blacks nominated for ambassadorships, Williams is not 
opposed by Kux's organization, which prides itself on being a watchdog against 
shamelessly unqualified political appointees. "(Williams) represents the 
diversity in diplomatic postings that we support," Kux said. 
</P>
<P>
 So in a world of political appointments, in an age of political correctness, 
Williams is likely to be accorded a certain deference and benefit of the doubt. 
Observed one congressional aide: "Republicans don't want to be identified as 
targeting a black ambassador nominated by Clinton." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Senate's vote on his nomination has been held up by some senators 
-- the White House was hoping he would be confirmed before Christmas -- Dodd 
now dismisses that glitch as pure politics and a flexing of muscles by 
colleagues who were annoyed over other matters. "It's sometimes difficult to 
discern the motivations of senators," Dodd said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Williams' political connections are not to be underestimated. 
</P>
<P>
 "His wife is an influential member of Congress and close to the White House," 
Dodd said. "I think in the Bahamas, people will know that he has access." 
</P>
<P>
 During his confirmation hearing, Williams was careful to stress his background 
in government, but he did not give short shrift to his experience in the car 
business: "It allowed me to understand management concepts and I assisted my 
company in record profits," Williams said.  
</P>
<P>
 Even Sen. Frank Murkowski (R-Alaska), who grumbled during a meeting of the 
Foreign Relations Committee that Williams knew only "the automobile business 
and the football business," was careful to add the caveat that that did not 
automatically mean he could not be a good ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
 Or as Dodd said over the phone, laughing: "I suppose if you can sell cars, you 
can sell American foreign policy."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; QUAKE VICTIMS COMPLAIN OF HOUSING 
DISCRIMINATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN HURST, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal disaster officials said Saturday that earthquake victims seeking 
emergency housing have lodged more than 200 complaints against landlords for 
alleged illegal discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials, responding to what they termed a "substantial" problem, issued 
a warning that landlords would be hauled into court and prosecuted if they used 
race, gender, national origin, disabilities or family size to discriminate 
against quake victims seeking housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberta Achtenberg, a federal Housing and Urban Development assistant 
secretary, said a strike force of fair housing officials has been set up in Los 
Angeles to deal with the complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be a significant presence now and into the foreseeable future," said 
Achtenberg, explaining that such discrimination is against federal and state 
fair-housing laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinforcing Achtenberg's comments at a news briefing in Pasadena, Nelson A. 
Diaz, general counsel for HUD, promised that the strike team will take 
aggressive action against landlords who discriminate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will issue charges as quickly as possible and make sure they are brought 
before a court of law," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have nothing else to do, but to make sure that (fair housing law) is 
enforced." 
</P>
<P>
 Achtenberg said that among the complaints received by disaster officials was 
one from an African American woman who contended that a landlord sought an 
extra $120 "under the table" when she attempted to rent an apartment through 
the federal emergency housing plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In another case, Achtenberg said, a dark-skinned Iranian couple arranged by 
phone to rent emergency housing, but were told when they arrived that a mistake 
had been made and that the apartment was rented.  
</P>
<P>
 Shortly afterward, a fair-skinned couple with no accent was offered the 
apartment, Achtenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 HUD Secretary Henry G. Cisneros said Saturday that 12,804 federal certificates 
for 18 months of subsidized housing had been handed out to quake victims, but 
only 2,372 families who have received certificates have obtained leases. A 
smaller number, 618, have moved in, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real challenge now is to try to move people into apartments," Cisneros 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 To make the program more attractive to landlords, certain federal regulations 
have been waived, such as the subsidized housing requirement that landlords 
give tenants 90 days to move after receiving eviction notices, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros said some landlords were reluctant to lease apartments to certificate 
holders for fear the tenants would be unable to pay the rent after the 18-month 
emergency subsidy ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not want to give people a three-month free ride on the backs of 
property owners," he said.

MALIBU MUSIC MAN; QUADRIPLEGIC FINDS FREEDOM IN GIVING STRUGGLING FOLK SINGERS 
A VOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the quiet subculture that is folk music, a special kind of reverence is 
reserved for Brian May. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not because of the way he plays the guitar. He can't play guitar. He 
can't move his arms. Or his legs. 
</P>
<P>
 May is a 43-year-old quadriplegic who contracted polio through a faulty 
vaccine as a child, has long outlived his insurance settlement and needs 
around-the-clock care, including four hours for a bath. He breathes through a 
respirator, is constantly short of money and in danger of being evicted. 
</P>
<P>
 All he has is his music. 
</P>
<P>
 From his rented home in Malibu, surrounded by masses of donated tape-recording 
equipment, he engineers and records performances by struggling, guitar-playing 
singer-songwriters, most of them searching for a record contract, anonymously 
pure among loud, sour-faced, publicity-obsessed musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Every week May produces a two-hour cassette tape of songs and interviews 
called "Malibu Folk" and mails it to a handful of public radio stations across 
the nation. Every week many of the stations broadcast the program, and letters 
from fans in places such as Quincy, Ill., trickle back through the mail to 
Malibu. And May, a college-educated man with a sly wit, feels connected to the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 "It liberates me," he said in his raspy, enthusiastic voice, sitting in his 
living room, where pictures of musicians who have played for him line the 
walls. "It takes me away from the pain and the worries. Plus, it gives artists 
a voice." 
</P>
<P>
 If you are an artist who has driven up Pacific Coast Highway to the far edge 
of Malibu to record a few of your songs for May while he sits inert; if you 
have watched his wife, Lupe, arrange the microphones and knobs and monitors in 
response to May's instructions; if you have heard his effusive gratitude when 
you are finished playing -- once you have experienced this, the musicians say, 
you have a tough time feeling sorry for yourself, no matter how your career is 
breaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing for him, it's a different vibe than what you experience anywhere," 
said David Pless, a Mississippi-born singer who lives in Sherman Oaks and 
writes songs such as "Lines in Leather," about the Midwest floods of 1993. 
Pless was unaware that May is disabled until he arrived at his house. "Just 
having the experience of working with him has made me look at things a little 
differently." 
</P>
<P>
 May became different in 1955, at age 5, when he was growing up in Pacific 
Palisades. He was one of 79 children in the United States who that year 
received a polio shot from a batch of improperly manufactured vaccine -- shots 
that spread the poliomyelitis virus.

 He was almost completely paralyzed. Doctors put him in an iron lung for a year 
and a half to keep him alive. Soon after, his father died. His family sued the 
lab that manufactured the vaccine, won in court, then settled for about 
$350,000 in 1962, an amount predicated on a doctor's prediction that May would 
live only 15 more years. 
</P>
<P>
 Around that time May got interested in folk music. Then the Beatles hit, and 
the melodies captured him. His mother hired tutors to instruct him at home. He 
learned German and Spanish. He attended high school through a telephone hookup 
and -- at a time when there were few facilities for the disabled -- began 
attending classes at UCLA in 1968. It took him seven years to earn degrees in 
Spanish and Italian. By then he was 27 and the settlement money had run out.  
</P>
<P>
 How would he earn a living? He had always liked radio. It was a lifeline. In 
the late 1970s he developed the idea of taping musicians and interviewing them. 
He worked some part-time radio jobs. He became a close friend of singer Peter 
Yarrow of Peter, Paul and Mary in 1976, interviewing him for a college radio 
station. Yarrow contributed for a time to keep May solvent.  
</P>
<P>
 May was surviving, but he was not thriving. He had this dream of doing a 
weekly folk music show and there were two things wrong with the dream. One was 
that he could not crack the local radio Establishment; he was able to do 
fill-in shows on Los Angeles FM station KPFK, but only occasionally. The other 
problem was folk music itself. It wasn't trendy. It wasn't popular. There were, 
as there have always been, new generations of singer-songwriters probing new 
themes with their guitars, but radio tended to ignore them and most record 
companies branded folk music a non-category. Pete Seeger is old and Phil Ochs 
is dead. 
</P>
<P>
 So May did two things that made a difference. In 1990, surviving as he had for 
years on charity and monthly checks from the county and Social Security, he 
married Lupe Mariscal, who had been his full-time caretaker since 1978. And in 
1992, lacking any encouragement from the radio Establishment, he syndicated his 
own show.  
</P>
<P>
 He mailed off tapes to stations in Illinois, Colorado, Oregon, Minnesota and 
Northern California. Some started to run it regularly, others irregularly. It 
was costing him money in tapes and postage that he did not have -- he says his 
monthly benefits are $1,800, far less than the cost of rent and home care -- 
but that did not matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he was on a mission. He was a minister for folk music, often referred to 
by its devotees as acoustic music, to distinguish it from the moldy days of the 
hootenanny and civil rights march. By last month, Acoustic Guitar magazine was 
praising him as "one of acoustic music's true angels," never mentioning his 
disability. 
</P>
<P>
 May is so focused on his mission that he has to ask his visitor what "gangsta 
rap" means. It is a sad irony: Gangsta rap, etched in crude braggadocio, is 
often hailed by music critics for touching societal nerves the way folk music 
did in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 The people May touches are like singer-songwriter Jeff Gold of Hollywood, who 
teaches clarinet and saxophone while trying to make it on the club circuit. "I 
don't think I've ever run into anybody who's more dedicated to what he's doing 
than Brian. I wish I had a lot of money to give him," Gold said. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Yarrow, who has money, has given some of it to May but is reluctant to 
talk about it. This is about friendship, not money, he said. One night years 
back, when Yarrow was performing at the Greek Theatre, he had May come onstage 
and they sang a piece Yarrow had written for a friend fighting cancer, "With 
Your Face To The Wind." ( I see you smiling again, spirits moving again, I know 
you're going to win. ) 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, May won a national Victory award, known as the Academy Awards for the 
disabled. May describes himself as a man "always stuck in between tragedy and 
success." He has maneuvered through life and gained a respectable professional 
identity through sheer will and a remarkable temperament. Yet he is paying the 
price for never having mastered personal finance, and is always worried about 
paying tomorrow's bills. 
</P>
<P>
 On this day, the sky and ocean are bursting brilliantly into his 
hardwood-floored living room as he plays a tape of a recent "Malibu Folk" show 
through two large speakers. The guests were members of an Orange County 
quartet, the Woodbys, who performed and were interviewed by May. May 
complimented them about a song they had just sung, "Waltzing on the Deck of the 
Titanic," and asked them to describe it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," one of the musicians explained, "it's the idea that if you don't pay 
attention to the things around you, the ship's going down." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's like my life," May rasps as loud as he can over the tape, over the hum 
of his respirator. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, with his face to the wind, he laughs.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; DESTRUCTION HOPSCOTCHES THROUGHOUT COUNTY; 
DISASTER: MANY AREAS THAT ARE NOT MAKING HEADLINES ARE HARD-HIT TOO. AT LEAST 
54 CITIES HAVE DAMAGE. ESTIMATES ARE EXPECTED TO RISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Although attention has been riveted on the most intensely damaged areas, the 
Jan. 17 earthquake reached into communities across the region, cutting a broad 
swath of destruction through at least 54 of Los Angeles County's 88 cities, a 
Times survey has found. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage reports range from two collapsing chimneys in La Canada Flintridge to a 
crumpling shopping center garage bridge in Hawthorne, from two water heaters 
jiggling in Cudahy to a section of a house tumbling down a hill in Pacific 
Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the South Bay, which at first seemed virtually unscathed, a landmark 
marina was damaged. King Harbor Marina in Redondo Beach suffered $2.5-million 
in damage when subsoil collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was far from the only cultural landmark to suffer. Glendale's recently 
restored Alex Theater, distinguished by its Art Deco design and 100-foot tower, 
sustained $30,000 in damage, mostly cracked and fallen plaster. The historic 
Casa Adobe de San Rafael in Glendale was badly damaged, as was the Sand and Sea 
Club on Santa Monica Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake also broke $25,000 worth of windows at Hollywood Park in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Governmental agencies and the insurance industry are trying to get a fix on 
the breadth of the damage but have not completed the reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary estimate last week put Los Angeles County's dollar loss at $3.6 
billion, suggesting that the Northridge quake will be among the costliest 
disasters in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 And all estimates are expected to rise: Though the wake-up call from hell took 
just 30 seconds to wreak its havoc on the region, toting up the damage is a 
painstaking process. 
</P>
<P>
 It means placing a dollar value on mortar and brick, while coming to terms 
with the incalculable loss of lives and landmarks, and with the fickle nature 
of fault lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The earthquake's caprice meant that Santa Monica got socked with $200 million 
in damage and 4,000 displaced residents, while Glendora escaped unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whew!" said Glendora Mayor Bob Kuhn, after finding his domain intact. "You 
just know that someday it will be your turn." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Santa Monica, other Los Angeles County cities that got their turn on 
Jan. 17 include Santa Clarita ($219 million), Calabasas ($43 million), Burbank 
($27.9 million) and Glendale ($26.1 million). 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, Simi Valley ($310 million) and Fillmore ($250 million) also 
took it on the chin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the flood of 1928, this is the most devastating calamity this community 
has had to experience," said Fillmore City Manager Roy Payne. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem for Fillmore and other smaller cities was getting 
attention amid the life-and-death drama being played out in the San Fernando 
Valley, where the quake was centered. Some were able to deliver their message 
shortly after the quake at a meeting with President Clinton. Santa Monica Mayor 
Judy Abdo was there, and said she kept pointing frantically at herself until 
Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan called on her to report the seaside 
community's devastating losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, Abdo said, Santa Monica residents were asking: "What about us?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Still, when people come in here they say: 'I'm shocked at what I see,' " Abdo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the city's losses were its largest employer, St. John's Hospital, which 
sustained $25 million in damage. St. Monica's Catholic Church and the Sea 
Castle apartments at the beach were also badly damaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale is still trying to attract attention to the extent of its losses. 
Glendale's Casa Adobe de San Rafael sustained $300,000 in damage and about 600 
people were displaced. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not fared that well," said Glendale Mayor Larry Zarian. "We keep on 
hearing that the Los Angeles and San Fernando Valley (areas) have been hit 
hard, but I believe we have been hit hard too." 
</P>
<P>
 Other areas within the Los Angeles city limits -- Hollywood and South-Central 
Los Angeles, for example -- have also complained that they are being swallowed 
up in the damage estimate for Los Angeles as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 In other communities, such as Huntington Park and Ventura County's 
unincorporated areas, officials report a delayed reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first blush we looked around and said: 'We came through this pretty well.' 
But as the hours and days passed, we discovered there is more damage than we 
first thought," said Ventura County Supervisor Vicky Howard. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Park City Hall office manager Barbara Grimm said the city just 
posted its first notices to vacate two damaged apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're finding is (that) people are slow to respond . . . (A savings 
bank) waited for about a week and watched the light fixture fall a little every 
day until it fell," Grimm said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether they are digging out of the rubble or counting their blessings, 
officials throughout the region are all talking about retrofitting their 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabino M. Cici, vice mayor of San Gabriel, has some advice on that point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing is earthquake-proof," said Sabino, while mulling over the damage to 
the city's recently retrofitted mission and Civic Center. "All you can do is 
make sure nothing falls on someone's head." 
</P>

BILL BOYARSKY: UNION PACIFIC'S STANCE COULD DERAIL ALAMEDA CORRIDOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's more trouble ahead for the Southland's biggest public works project -- 
the proposed $1.8-billion Alameda Corridor high-speed freight line between the 
harbor and Downtown Los Angeles that backers say will create thousands of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobs are badly needed here after a long recession and defense cutbacks. The 
corridor project would generate them by greatly increasing the capacity of the 
L.A. and Long Beach harbors just as trade with the Far East is taking off. Much 
of the new work would be at the harbors. More would be created by new 
export/import, manufacturing and service businesses expected to move to the 
presently moribund industrial strip between Downtown and the L.A. and Long 
Beach ports. 
</P>
<P>
 But new trouble for this endeavor is coming from a railroad involved in the 
project, the Union Pacific. UP objects to the amount of money its trains will 
be charged for using the high-speed rail line. 
</P>
<P>
 When I looked in on the Alameda Corridor last year, it was being threatened by 
another railroad, the Southern Pacific, a company once known as the Octopus for 
the immense power it wielded in California at the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 SP wanted $260 million for land needed to build the rail line. This was more 
than the publicly owned ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, the main sponsors 
of the Alameda Corridor, wanted to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 But three state Assembly members from the area, Martha Escutia of Huntington 
Park, Betty Karnette of Long Beach and Juanita M. McDonald of Carson, worked to 
turn public opinion against SP. Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan subjected SP 
to hard bargaining. Finally, SP, no longer possessing the Octopus' power, 
agreed to drop its selling price by $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Union Pacific doesn't have a nickname as colorful as the Octopus. Nor does 
it have as big a place in California history as the SP, which once owned the 
governor, the Legislature and countless mayors and judges. 
</P>
<P>
 But Union Pacific's current maneuver is right in line with the way railroads 
have always thrown their weight around. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the Alameda Corridor is built, Union Pacific, Southern Pacific and Santa Fe 
would send freight trains along the high-speed tracks. At present, the three 
railroads use their own, older tracks, which block surface street 
intersections. But Union Pacific does not want to pay the $30-per-container fee 
that the Alameda Corridor authorities intend to charge the railroads for using 
the new line. Union Pacific offered to pay slightly more than $2 a container. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are perfectly willing to use the Alameda Corridor but we have to utilize 
it at a price structure that is reasonable," said Michael Kelley, Union 
Pacific's vice president for marketing services. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, I went over to City Hall and talked about the project with Deputy 
Mayor Michael F. Keeley. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeley is one of Riordan's most trusted aides. He's in charge of important 
Administration economic development initiatives, a role that requires him to 
deal with industry and the many layers of Southland government. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alameda Corridor is a perfect example of that. The city of L.A. is just 
one of the parties involved, although it is the major player because of its 
size and clout. But Keeley must also talk to the three railroads and the other 
corridor supporters -- California's two senators, the county's congressional 
and legislative delegations, and the other cities along the corridor.  
</P>
<P>
 The morning we talked, Keeley seemed confident, even cheerful, about the task 
ahead. He gave me the financing plan for the Alameda Corridor, done in 
graphics, straight from a Mac, easy to understand. 
</P>
<P>
 It looked tenuous. The L.A. and Long Beach harbor would contribute $400 
million. The state and federal governments would put in $135 million more. 
Bonds, supported by the fees paid by the railroads, would bring in $600 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves the project $700 million short, which the Alameda team hopes to 
lobby from Washington. And chances for getting that are not great because the 
federal government, short of money, must also provide Southern California with 
earthquake relief and other aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Alameda Corridor backers cannot begin to lobby Washington until all three 
railroads -- Southern Pacific, Santa Fe and Union Pacific -- sign an agreement 
to use the corridor. Keeley said he is optimistic about Southern Pacific and 
Santa Fe. It's Union Pacific that is the big question mark -- and the major 
threat to the project at present. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Keeley said he thinks the railroads can afford to pay the fees, and will 
profit from the Alameda Corridor and the Far East trade that will feed it. 
"We've had a rail revolution in our country," he said. "Rail has gotten a lot 
more competitive. So it's just cheaper when you are sending cargo from the Far 
East to (the East and Midwest) to send it to our port and put it on rail than 
it is go through the Panama Canal. That wasn't true (a few years ago) because 
of the economics of rail." 
</P>
<P>
 The Union Pacific's Kelley told me negotiations will resume this week. If the 
railroad and the local authorities don't get together, it could stall the 
corridor project. With so many jobs at stake, that would be a real loss.

SCOTT HARRIS: RECOVERY FROM A SICKNESS WITHIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I'm what you would have referred to as a garbage can. I'd have taken just 
about anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Liquor, pot, downers, uppers, acid, coke, heroin -- you name it, Candy Smyers 
was game. 
</P>
<P>
 At first it was barbiturates. She'd get so zonked that she was expelled from 
Birmingham High. Her first arrest came at age 18. There were a variety of 
charges, including drug offenses and forgery. The judge offered her state 
prison or a rehab program at Camarillo State Hospital. She chose rehab. 
</P>
<P>
 After 18 months, Candy came out, believing that her problems were over. But 
after her grandfather's funeral, she found his medication. That's when Candy 
discovered she'd still try just about anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Candy figured she could "maintain" on pot and booze without getting 
hooked on pills or hard drugs. Then she met Ike. He was deep into heroin. 
Candy, barely 20, thought she could rescue him. 
</P>
<P>
 They got a place together. "I did," she says, "the relationship thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Candy tells her story in an office at I-ADARP, the common name for the 
Inter-Agency Drug and Alcohol Rehabilitation Program. Candy, now 39, works as a 
counselor at this Van Nuys-based outpatient program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The relationship thing." The syndrome is familiar in her line of work. For 
people hooked on drugs or alcohol, it's a pattern, she explains. Substance 
abuse is a common foundation for human relationship. Also a weak one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had that idealism," she recalls, referring to her desire to save Ike from 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 They were together about two years. By the end, Candy was into heroin herself. 
</P>
<P>
 Ike disappeared from her life. Candy managed to kick heroin on her own, 
without entering treatment. For years she avoided "hard stuff," using only 
marijuana and alcohol. She used them even while she had her first formal job as 
a drug counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 Candy figured her problem was under control. She got a job in auto sales and 
did well enough to buy a home. She was maintaining -- doing so well that she 
figured it would be OK to do a line of cocaine now and then. 
</P>
<P>
 At first she did it about once or twice a month. In time, Candy was spending 
$1,500 a week on coke. 
</P>
<P>
 She had stopped smoking pot. "It was making me more paranoid," she explained. 
But cocaine made her thirsty, so she was drinking more and more. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had me so trapped. . . . "  
</P>
<P>
 Candy was a wreck. Cocaine's cost goes beyond the price. She lost her home and 
had to leave her job. In February, 1990, she entered a residential rehab 
program for women in Pasadena.  
</P>
<P>
 "I needed support. I needed to be in safe places, instead of bars." 
</P>
<P>
 By April, when she left that program, Candy had put pills, heroin, pot and 
cocaine behind her. 
</P>
<P>
 But, "after I got out, I thought I could still drink. That's the nature of the 
beast." 
</P>
<P>
 Before long she realized there was that last dragon to slay. Candy entered 
Alcoholics Anonymous. And she started to visit I-ADARP to find moral support. 
</P>
<P>
 Liquor turned out to be the hardest habit to break. Her relationship with it 
was a long one. And as she explains: "Alcohol is legal. It's acceptable. It's 
always going to be there." 
</P>
<P>
 On Christmas Day, 1990, she had her last drink. Friends sometimes ask her why 
she didn't at least wait to toast in the new year. Candy says she finally 
decided that enough was enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Candy picked an unusual time to quit. But for I-ADARP and other drug and 
alcohol programs, January and February tend to be very busy. People tend to 
binge over the holidays, then resolve to better themselves after the new year. 
</P>
<P>
 And as with personal calamities, natural disasters such as earthquakes are 
another reason people look to drugs and alcohol. According to some reports, 
Valium sales have climbed since the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh sure," Candy says. "There's a lot of people that are maybe borderline in 
recreational use who were indulging and getting into trouble with coping at 
all." 
</P>
<P>
 As Candy would attest, dependency on narcotics can be a catastrophe in itself. 
That's what I-ADARP and other drug programs are here for. 
</P>
<P>
 On the afternoon of Feb. 16, I-ADARP will host an open house to mark its 20th 
anniversary. They are expecting politicians to hand out plaques and 
proclamations. And they are expecting some of the thousands of clients who've 
been helped over the years. The office is at 7400 Van Nuys Blvd., Suite 207. If 
you're a prospective client, they hope you drop by. 
</P>
<P>
 Candy, who's been clean and sober for more than three years, says she'll be 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 And -- who knows? -- her old boyfriend Ike may be there as well. 
</P>
<P>
 He showed up at I-ADARP a couple of years ago, after hearing that Candy was 
working there. 
</P>
<P>
 "He called before he showed up, so I wouldn't have a heart attack," Candy 
says. "Our last encounter wasn't friendly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really did believe he wasn't on the planet. He could have been dead for all 
I knew." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Ike, who had seemed beyond hope, had entered a residential rehab 
program. He'd been clean for six months when he called Candy. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wanted to reconnect with somebody he knew from those days, who was still 
around and alive and clean and sober." 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, Ike's Narcotics Anonymous group gave him a cake to mark his first 
anniversary of clean living. This is a common practice, a token of recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 It's sort of like a birthday party, Candy explains, because your life begins 
anew.

 The Northridge earthquake damaged at least 171 officially designated landmarks 
and other historic or architecturally significant buildings in the city of Los 
Angeles, according to preliminary surveys. Repairs and seismic strengthening 
could cost more than $30 million, not including massive work needed at the 
Coliseum and UCLA, the studies suggest. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a fairly hefty bite," Rodney Punt, assistant general manager of the 
Los Angeles Department of Cultural Affairs, said of the surveys' findings. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the harm appears cosmetic, such as cracked plaster at the Shrine 
Auditorium, the 1926 Moorish-style theater on Jefferson Boulevard, and some 
damaged molding below dome-like astronomical murals in the 1935 Griffith 
Observatory in Griffith Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, 60 landmark or historic buildings will each need at least $100,000 in 
repairs, says the survey by the Los Angeles Conservancy, a nonprofit 
preservationist group. That report looked at buildings within city limits that 
were on or eligible for city, state or federal landmark lists before the Jan. 
17 temblor and now are tagged by city inspectors with yellow or red warning 
notices about possible structural danger. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly the magnitude is severe, but we are grateful that it is not worse," 
said Linda Dishman, conservancy executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 A separate assessment was provided by the city's Cultural Affairs Department. 
It found some quake damage at 122 of the 588 buildings or sites designated by 
the city as "historic-cultural monuments." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Only two of those city-designated landmarks are red-tagged for structural 
danger -- the El Portal Theater in North Hollywood and the vacant Fire Station 
No. 27 in Hollywood. The red tag indicates that the building is unsafe for 
occupancy in its present condition. Jay Oren, staff architect with the cultural 
affairs department, believes that both sites and most other landmarks can be 
saved. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Portal on Lankershim Boulevard, a former vaudeville house and cinema 
built in 1926, was recently renovated as a live theater auditorium. With its 
ceiling fallen, the El Portal suffered an estimated $1.5 million in damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The 64-year-old fire station, a two-story brick building on North Cahuenga 
Boulevard, was once the largest firehouse west of the Mississippi. Since its 
1992 closing, it was slated to become a Fire Department museum. City inspectors 
initially estimated that the station needed $1.4 million in seismic repairs. 
Terry Wong, a city building engineer, said Friday that "a million is a little 
more than is necessary" to fix a separated wall and strengthen the station. 
</P>
<P>
 Other heavily damaged landmarks, the conservancy report found, include the 
Andres Pico Adobe in Mission Hills, an 1834 house built by a Mexican general 
that inspectors say needs $500,000 in repairs; the Hollywood-Western Building, 
a four-story Art Deco landmark built in 1928 that for many years housed the 
famed Central Casting offices and now may require $4 million in seismic fixes, 
and the Egyptian Theater, the 1922 Hollywood-on-the-Nile-style movie palace 
that has been empty since last year and may need $260,000 in repairs to its 
broken rear wall, among other damage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The heavy losses in Santa Monica, Fillmore and other areas were not included 
in the surveys. Within the city of Los Angeles, two prominent landmarks were 
not cited because both are either wholly or partly state-owned -- Royce Hall at 
UCLA and the Coliseum. Royce's twin Romanesque towers suffered structural 
damage and, as a result, its auditorium cannot be used until repairs are made. 
The Coliseum's extensive damage may wind up costing $35 million or more to fix. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonprofit institutions, city-owned buildings and private homes are eligible to 
receive federal grants or loans for repairs; some commercial structures might 
receive low-interest loans from the Small Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the National Trust for Historic Preservation and First Interstate 
Bank of California announced Friday a low-interest loan pool for owners of 
damaged historic buildings. The maximum loan amount is $20,000 and the 
conservancy and the Getty Conservation Institute will provide technical advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Most experts consider the damage surveys and repair estimates to be very 
tentative so soon after the quake. That was the case in Northern California 
after the 1989 Loma Prieta temblor, said Lisbeth Henning, assistant director of 
the National Trust's regional office in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, it is difficult to separate quake repairs from recommended 
seismic strengthening. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The city-owned Watts Towers suffered only a few new hairline cracks in 
January's shocks. "None of them is what I would call overly critical," city 
official Punt said. Yet, the glass, concrete, steel and tile towers -- 
considered a triumph of folk architecture -- previously developed some base 
cracks that could cost $900,000 to probe and fix, he estimated.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's not primarily caused by the quake, but it could be aggravated by 
aftershocks," Punt said. "We are worried about the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the Frank Lloyd Wright-designed Hollyhock House in Barnsdall Park 
may require about $600,000 in work, both for general strengthening against 
temblors and for repairing cracked rooftop spires and weakened library walls, 
Punt said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 171 buildings on the conservancy's survey, 56 were estimated to require 
$20,000 or less in repair.

 Of the 88 cities in Los Angeles County, more than 50 were touched in some way 
by the Jan. 17 6.6 magnitude earthquake. Attention has been focused on damage

MARCHERS PLEAD FOR PEACE IN VIOLENT NEIGHBORHOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JESSE KATZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Armed with green ribbons of neutrality, nearly 50 activists marched through 
one of Los Angeles' most violent neighborhoods on Saturday, but few hard-core 
gang members were on hand to heed their pleas for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 To shouts of "Black Power" and "Viva La Raza," the marchers wound their way 
through the streets of Venice's Oakwood district, where a fierce rivalry 
between black and Latino gangs has left 11 people dead and more than 30 wounded 
in the last four months. 
</P>
<P>
 The multiracial group -- which ranged from members of the Brown Berets to the 
Coalition Against Police Abuse to a Mayan spiritualist waving an incense burner 
-- called on the gangs to end their warfare and help rebuild a community that 
has been held virtually captive by reckless gunfire. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to let these guys know that the community supports the need for 
a truce," said Michael Zinzun, a longtime political activist. "That's why we're 
putting ourselves on the line right now." 
</P>
<P>
 But like Zinzun, many in the crowd were from outside the Venice area and 
appeared to be pushing social agendas that reached far beyond the question of a 
gang truce. That fact was not lost on Lupe Gonzalez, who watched from her front 
yard as the marchers chanted the names of their heroes -- Cesar Chavez, Malcolm 
X -- and ridiculed those they hold in low esteem -- the police and CIA. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids who should be out here are not out here," said Gonzalez, 48, whose 
home was sprayed with gunfire at Christmastime when an assailant spotted two 
former gang members helping paint the small stucco bungalow. "We don't need 
anyone to come into our community and tell us what our problem is." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's rally comes after months of violent clashes between a black gang in 
Oakwood and two Latino gangs, one in Venice and the other several miles to the 
east in the Mar Vista Gardens housing project. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, police say, most of the bloodshed in those neighborhoods stemmed 
from conflicts between the two Latino gangs. But after they forged a truce in 
1992, they began to war with the black gang, which had coexisted peacefully 
with them on the same turf. Investigators have linked the interracial rivalry 
to a battle being waged by prison gangs over control of the drug trade. 
</P>
<P>
 To help fight the violence, the Los Angeles County district attorney's office 
Friday announced a program designed to crack down on hard-core members of the 
three gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, Los Angeles police officers will notify prosecutors whenever a 
gang member from those neighborhoods is arrested. Prosecutors will advise 
judges, who will be asked to immediately sentence the suspects for probation 
violations, regardless of the crime for which they were arrested.

HOMELESS COUPLE TIE THE KNOT AT SHELTER WEDDING; CEREMONY: THEIR VOWS AT 
NATIONAL GUARD ARMORY ADD NEW MEANING TO THE WORDS 'FOR RICHER, FOR POORER . . 
.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The bride wore a lacy beige dress. The groom was in a freshly pressed red 
shirt. And the guests were sprawled on cots nearby.  
</P>
<P>
 A few people nodded off during the ceremony, but Lorraine Cronjager and Ron 
Barklow didn't seem to notice. They were too busy looking at each other 
Saturday night as they became the first couple to get married at the National 
Guard Armory. 
</P>
<P>
 Cronjager and Barklow, who are both homeless, nervously exchanged wedding 
vows, promising to care for each other "in sickness and in health, for richer 
or for poorer." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the culmination of a whirlwind three-month courtship in the shelters 
and on the streets of Santa Ana, where Cronjager, a former waitress in her 
mid-40s, and Barklow, 40, a former warehouse worker, both searched for 
friendship and respect. They found it in each other.  
</P>
<P>
 "I know it will work," Cronjager said as she twirled her bouquet of pink 
carnations just before embarking on her sojourn up the aisle between the 
gymnasium's cots. "We're a lot alike and we've both been through a lot."  
</P>
<P>
 Cronjager, who is from Newport Beach, has been married twice before, each time 
for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Barklow, whose red shirt and black slacks were donated for the wedding, said 
he doesn't quite know what to expect because he's never been married.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't plan on getting married again. She's the right woman. That's the way 
I feel," Barklow said.  
</P>
<P>
 The wedding brought an evening of excitement to the armory, where the county 
provides food, showers and beds to about 100 homeless people on cold winter 
nights.  
</P>
<P>
 As banda music and the song "Tomorrow" from the musical "Annie" blared from a 
stereo, Orange County Clerk Gary L. Granville officiated -- free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew what the conditions were, and so it would be fiendish for me not to," 
Granville said. He also waived the fee of $62.50 couples normally pay for a 
marriage license. 
</P>
<P>
 Groomsman Valdivio Harvey, who has been homeless about six months, said he 
wished the couple great happiness. "Having someone is important, because if you 
don't have the necessities the other people have -- a companion -- you're very, 
very sad," Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony, replete with two wedding cakes, sparkling cider, and the 
throwing of the garter and bouquet, brought some uncommon joy to the people who 
call the armory home during the winter, said Maria Mendoza, the county director 
of homeless issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are not a lot of things for these people to look forward to. Times are 
pretty tough," Mendoza said. "But the little community around the shelter has 
been cheered up by all this. Someone has found a bit of happiness."

SAN JUAN'S PAST, FUTURE MEET DOWNTOWN; REDEVELOPMENT: THE CITY MUST BALANCE THE 
INTERESTS OF PRESERVATION AND COMMERCE WHILE CONSIDERING HISTORIC TOWN CENTER 
PLANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A wealthy rancher rides in from the dusty hills to rescue a financially 
struggling town. He and a local saloon owner round up more than $1 million in 
cash and promise to buy an entire city block, outmaneuvering a band of 
out-of-town investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Millionaire rancher Richard J. O'Neill's recent bid to buy a major chunk of 
downtown San Juan Capistrano may play like a spaghetti Western, but it's 
actually the latest real-life chapter in the history of this city, one of 
California's oldest communities.  
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill's plans -- although as yet unspecified -- have stirred up new 
questions over an ongoing local dilemma: How does historic San Juan Capistrano 
inject new life into its aged, Spanish-style downtown while still preserving 
its history? 
</P>
<P>
 It is a question that has plagued the city for two decades. But it has new 
life with the arrival of O'Neill and the anticipated unveiling in the coming 
months of the city's plans for a new downtown renovation called the Historic 
Town Center. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are hoping that O'Neill, other prospective downtown investors 
and the town center project will bring economic vitality to the city without 
sparking another battle between two powerful local political factions -- the 
historic preservationists and downtown business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "City leaders since the mid-1970s have given an enormous amount of thought 
about what should occur in the historic downtown," Councilman Gary L. 
Hausdorfer said. "Hopefully, what evolves there will be something that is 
pleasing to all the competing political interests in town." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, keeping peace downtown has not been easy. The city's 
redevelopment agency, which was launched in 1983 to inject new vitality in the 
city and now owns most of the downtown, is the moving force behind new projects 
and owns the land that O'Neill wants to buy. In town, the agency is regarded as 
a villain or a savior, depending on who you ask. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents on the preservationist side, such as Dr. Roy Byrnes, a former mayor 
and city councilman, charge that redevelopment has over-commercialized a 
charming old city, bringing in traffic and tourists at the expense of a bucolic 
way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Redevelopment in San Juan Capistrano has been a severe mistake," Byrnes said. 
"The whole thing was a foolish adventure and the people with their hands on the 
wheel running this city should have known better." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonsense, said Ken Friess, a former 17-year city councilman who helped launch 
the agency and continues to be its outspoken promoter. He is now a downtown 
builder and consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any objective person can go downtown on a Friday night and see 
the life, the vitality there and say it was a mistake," Friess said. "None of 
that could have happened without the redevelopment agency." 
</P>
<P>
 Like it or not, the redevelopment agency will remain a downtown player, 
largely because it owns about 10 acres of city property straddling El Camino 
Real, just south of the 218-year-old Mission San Juan Capistrano. The O'Neill 
parcel along Ortega Highway across the street from the mission is also agency 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 Later this month, the City Council is expected to vote on whether to sell the 
property to the rancher. O'Neill has declined to comment during the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, city planners have labored painstakingly to avoid a replay 
of what occurred in the late 1980s, the last time the redevelopment agency 
planned a town center along El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
 While preparing environmental documents for a proposed hotel and commercial 
project in 1988, city workers discovered a wall of buried 200-year-old adobe 
bricks, determined to be an old portion of the mission's barracks. 
</P>
<P>
 The preservationists erupted and, within months, their outcry halted the 
complex and chased the San Diego-based developer out of town. Downtown 
businessman Paul Farber, whose own Franciscan Plaza project was caught up in 
the protest, still shudders at the thought of that time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city at that time suddenly became very political, very political," Farber 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, however, city officials insist things are different. By summer, six 
new historic town center proposals will be unveiled.  
</P>
<P>
 Meant to embody both the new and old of San Juan Capistrano, the range of 
projects is designed to appeal to diverse interests, including a plaza, a 
museum, and archeological sites interspersed with shops and restaurants, city 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 And this time the planning process has been staffed side-by-side by business 
leaders and preservationists, said City Manager George Scarborough. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are doing is responding to a community process with unprecedented 
community involvement that is underway as we speak," Scarborough said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hausdorfer, who was a backer of the old hotel project and is the only 
remaining council member from those days, now says it may all work out for the 
best. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will never know how that project would have evolved . . . but ironically, 
it has all turned out to be a positive," Hausdorfer said. "It has given the 
residents the opportunity to do some things that otherwise might have been 
impossible. We now have an opportunity to make an intelligent decision, a truly 
rational decision."

A 'STREET FULL OF LOVE'; BLACK HISTORY PARADE IN SANTA ANA DRAWS DIVERSE CROWD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 The homeless man known as "Papa," pushing a cart heaped with his belongings, 
was moved to tears as the 1994 Black History Parade passed by on Broadway on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Impressed by the diversity of ethnic groups -- Asians, Latinos, whites and 
African Americans -- who turned outto march and line the street despite the 
cloudy morning, Papa watched silently as the parade swept by. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love my people, and I am glad to see the parade was not just one color, but 
all colors unified," said Papa, who is black. "It makes me cry, because the 
street is full of love." 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday's Black History Parade succeeded, its organizers said, in being a 
multiethnic celebration and an affirmation of African American culture to 
inspire the young. In all, 120 service clubs, drill teams, bands, equestrian 
units and other groups participated, some coming from as far as Los Angeles and 
San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 A parade organizer said about 3,500 people attended the event. Police had no 
crowd estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade and the cultural festival that followed became something of a giant 
reunion for Orange County's small black community, which once was concentrated 
in Santa Ana but over two decades has scattered widely into predominantly white 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade had failed to come off during the past two years because officials 
lacked money and organization. Saturday's participants said they had sorely 
missed the occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Joshua Ross, 56, of Santa Ana brought his 2-year-old son, also named Joshua, 
to the boy's first parade. "It will give him some insight about his blackness, 
what he is all about," said Ross, a Pentecostal minister. "It is something to 
see that can make a positive imprint in his mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross said he regretted trying to raise his four children in a county where 
they usually have little opportunity to meet others who are black or to learn 
about African American culture. "If I had a choice, I would be where there are 
more of us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several black students from Tustin High School, who had volunteered to carry 
parade banners, said they welcomed the attention that Black History Month 
brings to the contributions of their people. But they said they wished the 
sentiment would continue through the remainder of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is time black people got recognized," said Deniesha King, one of the 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 But many in the crowd of hundreds who had gathered to enjoy the music and 
marching were not black. Guadalupe Reyes, a Mexican immigrant, walked with her 
two sons to the parade from their Santa Ana home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like parades," Reyes said. She added that she also wanted her sons "to see 
black and Hispanic people together, so they will get along with people better." 
</P>
<P>
 "We all want to get along," said Gerald Reed, who was directing the all-black 
St. Stephen's Gospel Drill Team from San Diego, which followed on the heels of 
the Ballet Folklorico, a Mexican dance group in colorful swirling skirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Reed said the youths were marching "against drugs, gangs and children having 
children, and for Jesus." At a signal from Reed, the group shouted in chorus, 
"You don't need cocaine. Just call on Jesus' name." 
</P>
<P>
 Ocie Edwards, 57, of Pasadena was accompanied by her two granddaughters, who 
were part of the Pasadena Cowgirls drum squad and drill team. Their gold and 
red dresses sparkled in the occasional ray of sunlight that broke through the 
clouds. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the granddaughters, Jiai Triplett, 14, said she liked "watching people 
get excited as we go down the street." 
</P>
<P>
 Edwards said race relations have improved since she was a girl growing up in 
Texas and Nevada. Then, she said, parades were "lily white" and "the only 
blacks you would see were standing on the sidelines." 
</P>
<P>
 But Edwards said she wishes that the spirit of ethnic cooperation evident in 
Saturday's parade "would leave the parade and spread in the community." 
</P>
<P>
 The cultural fair at Santa Ana Stadium after the parade featured jazz, rap and 
gospel music, as well as booths featuring African American fashions, literature 
and art. Crowds lined up for hot dogs and soul food. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a need for banding together," said Ernesta Wright, 36, of Santa Ana, 
who was one of the coordinators of the parade and fair. "I'm most excited it 
actually happened," she added, referring to the event's previous organizational 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is fantastic," said Mike Smith, 37, who was at the festival with his 
cousin, Jerry Smith, 36, both of whom were raised in Chicago but now live in 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't miss the weather, but we miss our families and our roots," Mike 
Smith said. The cousins relished plates of barbecued chicken and a combination 
of red beans and rice that they said is known as "dirty rice" in Chicago.  
</P>
<P>
 "There is the feeling here that you're at home," said Jerry Smith as he 
glanced around the festival grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Dixon, 54, an Orange County park ranger who lives in Santa Ana, said: 
"I've met people today I haven't seen in 15 years. It takes something like this 
to bring us all together. I think (the parade) is here to stay now." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, Queen James, 68, and her two grandchildren perused a display of books 
about African American history. "You don't ordinarily see these in bookstores," 
said James, who had selected a book about "Miss Jane Pittman" while her 
7-year-old grandson clutched a paperback about Jackie Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 James said she drove from her nearly all-white neighborhood in Placentia to 
pick up her grandchildren from a nearly all-white neighborhood in Riverside and 
take them to the black cultural celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came because I wanted my grandchildren to learn something about black 
history," she said.

ASIAN 'YUPPIES' HOPE TO BRING SUCCESSFUL TET; FESTIVAL: A YOUNGER GROUP OF 
SPONSORS WITHOUT A LOT OF POLITICAL BAGGAGE HOPE THEY CAN MAKE A TRADITIONALLY 
TROUBLED WESTMINSTER CELEBRATION A WINNER IN THIS YEAR OF THE DOG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For as long as the Tet festival has flourished in Little Saigon, the lunar new 
year holiday has been cause for celebration of high culture and ancient history 
-- and ground-level infighting and politicking. 
</P>
<P>
 This year was no exception. During the hazy heat of summer, the celebration 
appeared to be headed for its zodiac sign -- the Year of the Dog. 
</P>
<P>
 With little fanfare in August, the Vietnamese Chamber of Commerce quietly 
eased out as festival sponsor amid fears that demonstrating extremists would 
crash the community's carnival because of the group's staunch support for the 
end of Vietnam trade sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Festival fans started searching for saviors for the 5-year-old festival of 
lion dances and fireworks, the biggest annual tourist draw for Little Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
 Enter the Vietnamese yuppies, born in Vietnam, reared in Orange County, 
educated in California and -- most important -- free from the scars of 
longstanding grudges and Byzantine political connections, yet exhibiting all 
the stubborn qualities of the sign of the Dog. 
</P>
<P>
 With little more than two months to organize, a core group of twentysomethings 
with newly minted university degrees in engineering and computers, politics and 
business have taken over the daily operation of the festival. The actual 
sponsors, the Asian American Merchants Assn., is expecting more than 100,000 
people to attend the three-day festival starting Feb. 11 on Bolsa Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were raised here and so we're a little more direct," said Van T. Tran, 29, 
one of the coordinators and a former law student who describes himself as a 
political activist. "We're emphasizing culture and tradition in this festival 
because we want to stay away from politics. It's just the wrong forum to spout 
off about the trade embargo." 
</P>
<P>
 If politics is taboo, other more sensitive issues are not. 
</P>
<P>
 One issue is making the money-losing festival pay for itself, raising some 
profits for local charities. The other is drawing non-Vietnamese visitors to 
Little Saigon, where one of the lingering complaints is that the Vietnamese 
merchants and shopkeepers do little or nothing to market themselves to others. 
The third issue is nurturing unity in a community fractured by political causes 
rooted in homeland issues. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, according to Tran, the festival's sponsors are purposely 
trying to reach out beyond its base to the broader community. They've invited 
other ethnic groups to participate in the entertainment such as troupes of 
Chinese acrobats and Mexican dancers. Volunteers for the festival have been 
solicited from Vietnamese and non-Vietnamese charity groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Their slogan stresses unity: Ket Hop Ve Tuong Lai -- United We Build for the 
Future. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the festival's nine-member coordinating board was handpicked to 
include three non-Vietnamese members along with Frank Jao, a prominent Little 
Saigon developer who owns the festival site, 20 acres of land behind the 99 
Market, a shopping center on Bolsa Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
 One new board member, Westminster Chamber of Commerce Executive Director Frank 
Zellner, said he hopes the festival's attempt to reach out will "open the gate" 
to more mixing of ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe this is the first step," said Zellner. "Once people see the 
participation by the other organizations outside the Vietnamese community maybe 
they'll feel more comfortable. It is intimidating when you walk in there and 
you're one of eight or 10,000 Vietnamese and you don't know the language. . . . 
But we need to come together as a community and to work together. They 
certainly are a factor here and we need to understand each other's cultures." 
</P>
<P>
 The roots of the Little Saigon festival date back to 1989 when a local 
pediatrician and Vietnamese chamber president, Co Pham, approached Westminster 
officials with the notion of a staging a grand Tet festival in the heart of the 
community. The goal was to promote a citywide cultural celebration, drawing 
more business to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But over the years, the festival has been plagued by various disputes. The 
Vietnamese press occasionally published articles questioning why the festival 
didn't make money. During the Year of the Ram in 1991, the chamber shifted 
control of the festival to the Vietnamese Community Council of Southern 
California after a dispute with city officials over a $52,920.23 bill for the 
use of public facilities the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 Money was also at issue when the Vietnamese chamber decided to bow out of this 
year's festivities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It costs a lot of money to operate," said Pham. "And second it bogs us down. 
If we were running it, we couldn't do any other programs which we think the 
community needs." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the chamber's political vision and its support for the lifting 
of trade sanctions against Vietnam. Pham, an outspoken supporter, was a target 
of regular demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Five or six months ago, some of the extremists were picketing in front of my 
office regarding my stance on Vietnam," said Pham, "The chamber didn't think it 
wise to do the Tet festival. We were afraid that President Clinton would lift 
the sanctions around Tet. And we were afraid they might try to blame the 
lifting on me. So we decided to prevent any demonstrations by staying out of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the festival made only $3,000 and drew about 30,000 people, mostly 
Vietnamese, according to Pham. But in the Year of the Dog, organizers are 
counting on cloud-free skies to draw more than 100,000 people to a 
multicultural event, and raise as much as $50,000 for charity, according to 
Jao, the developer. 
</P>
<P>
 Pham, the veteran organizer, worries that he has not seen enough of a 
publicity effort to achieve those lofty goals. However, the new organizers say 
it's their strategy to wait until this Monday to start advertising extensively 
on the radio and newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 The organizers concede their goals are optimistic, but then they are relying 
on the traditional qualities of the sign of the Dog: works well with others; 
generous yet stubborn.

BACKERS SAY RECALL WAS TRIGGERED BY PRINCIPLE; POLITICS: SEN. ROBERTI SAYS FOES 
ARE FIREARMS FANATICS ANGRY ABOUT HIS ASSAULT-WEAPONS BAN. BUT LEADERS 
EMPHASIZE A GOOD-GOVERNMENT AGENDA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Depending on who's talking, the leaders of a recently qualified effort to 
recall state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) are an eclectic coalition of 
madder-than-hell proponents of good government or a secretive bunch of 
vindictive gun nuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Recall advocates claim to be reformers who see Roberti, the powerful Senate 
president pro tempore for 13 years, as epitomizing a political system gone 
haywire with soft-on-crime liberalism, corruption, arrogance and deal-making. 
</P>
<P>
 But Roberti, who last week became the first state lawmaker in 80 years to be 
forced into a recall election, has denounced attempts to characterize his foes 
as anything other than vengeful -- and potentially dangerous -- firearms 
fanatics angry about a bill of his that led to a ban on assault weapons in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what this is all about," Roberti said at a recent news conference, 
holding up an Uzi assault rifle -- one of those banned from sale in California. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, says Bill Dominguez, chairman and standard-bearer of the anti-Roberti 
forces, who describes the senator's charges as a "smoke screen." 
</P>
<P>
 But in an interview, Dominguez acknowledged that the recall leadership has 
entered into a marriage of convenience with gun groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we called (gun activists) for financial help, it was almost a situation 
of them being ready to mortgage their houses," Dominguez said. "But call up 
someone and ask them to contribute to a movement to stop corruption in 
government, and they'd say, 'That's nice -- we'll get back to you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance was practical politics, said Dominguez, a Democrat. "To do 
something like this you need a tremendous amount of energy and money, and you 
can't get that with three people operating out of a garage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Dominguez, a systems analyst with the Trans-america Insurance Group 
and a candidate in the recall election, denies that firearms issues are the 
driving force behind his political activism, he nevertheless shares with 
enthusiasts of the 2nd Amendment the belief that gun control is liberalism's 
failed substitute for getting tough on criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I've been hanging around these 2nd Amendment people too long," 
Dominguez said, joking about their influence. Dominguez also ran against 
Roberti in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-Roberti movement has paid a stiff price for its alliance with the 
anti-gun control forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Such ties have handed Roberti valuable ammunition in his bid to virtually 
demonize his foes as single-issue gun "fanatics" or "extremists." The evidence 
has been compelling enough to prompt Handgun Control Inc., the sponsor of the 
recently passed federal Brady bill, to jump to Roberti's defense. The senator's 
aides have said they hope to turn the recall, scheduled for April 12, into a 
national referendum on gun control. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very intelligent ploy on his part," said Russ Howard, one of the 
behind-the-scenes leaders of the anti-Roberti group. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the recall movement cannot be dismissed as merely a puppet of the gun 
lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, among the five official sponsors of the recall are Glenn Bailey, 
38, an Encino educator and longtime environmental activist; Hans Rusche, 63, an 
engineering executive and local leader of Ross Perot's United We Stand 
movement, and Dolores White, 59, a realtor and veteran activist in county and 
state Republican circles. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Bailey and White ran against Roberti in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 White and seven others, including Dominguez and a Canoga Park gun dealer, this 
week filed as candidates to replace Roberti if the recall succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his participation is often cited to rebut charges that the recall is 
a product of gun-rights monomaniacs, Bailey is not insensitive to 2nd Amendment 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 A San Fernando Valley leader of the Green Party, Bailey has said that while he 
believes there is "far too much firepower in the hands of the public," he is 
"equally distrustful" of letting the government own all weaponry -- thus 
sounding a favorite theme in the gun movement, that private gun ownership is a 
bulwark against government tyranny. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Rusche said recently: "This gun thing has been played up 
too much by Roberti and the media. There's no question these people are 
involved. But the (National Rifle Assn.) hasn't supported us with money." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Rusche personally applauds Roberti's assault-weapon ban. "Such 
high-tech weapons belong on the battlefield, not on our streets," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Roberti camp contends that such views are the exception rather than 
the rule in a movement spawned by the gun lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 The Roberti thesis got a major boost when the media obtained a lengthy, 
confidential memo laden with sinister, threatening rhetoric, written to the NRA 
by recall advocate Howard. In the memo, Roberti is graphically described as the 
target of the anti-gun control movement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The beast is wounded," the memo says in one section, a reference to Roberti's 
costly 1992 struggle to win election to the Valley-based seat of former state 
Sen. Alan Robbins. "It's time to go in for the kill before he can run for 
something like attorney general." 
</P>
<P>
 Howard has justified the memo's strident anti-gun control language as a 
natural part of a sales pitch designed to get the NRA interested in supporting 
the Roberti recall. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard's involvement with the recall also stems from his participation in a 
failed 1990 campaign to block the reelection of former state Assemblyman Mike 
Roos. Howard said he joined the anti-Roos campaign because of the 1989 
assault-weapons ban, which Roos co-authored. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Dominguez and Howard say they have gotten no help from the 
NRA for their current recall drive. "I would have killed to have gotten their 
mailing list" of 350,000 California members, Dominguez has admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 And the recall leadership denies that they are out to punish Roberti for his 
assault-weapons law. "I'm not counting on the gun issue to make or break this 
recall," Dominguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Recall advocates also say the success of their petition drive proves that 
theirs is not a single-issue campaign. More than 20,000 registered voters 
signed the petitions that outlined -- as required by law -- proponents' 
arguments for recalling Roberti, as well as the senator's rebuttal. 
</P>
<P>
 But the pro-recall arguments mention as the last of five points that Roberti 
"advocates gun control but opposes capital punishment even for murderers of 
children."  
</P>
<P>
 Howard, 37, a stockbroker and South Bay resident, also resents being portrayed 
as a gun fanatic. He points to the fact -- confirmed by other sources -- that 
he was the first research director for the Proposition 174 school-voucher 
campaign. He also claims to have been an avid precinct worker for the campaign 
to oust former California Supreme Court Justice Rose Bird. 
</P>
<P>
 A lifetime NRA member, Howard insists that it is Roberti's political abuses 
that have motivated his drive to oust the senator. It was in 1990 that Howard 
met Dominguez and joined Californians Against Corruption (CAC), a group 
organized around the effort to defeat Roos. 
</P>
<P>
 CAC was founded by Dominguez and Richard L. Carone, a Rancho Palos Verdes 
resident and president of Finley Oil Well Services, an oil-drilling maintenance 
firm that has reported revenues of $5 million to $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 At its headquarters in Signal Hill, the CAC's taped answering machine message 
hotly denounces Roberti as one whose soft-on-crime record "has protected and 
released violent criminals like the ones who murdered Polly Klass and Kimba 
Reynolds and yet opposed your right to defend yourself against them." 
</P>
<P>
 CAC activities also have been praised by Neal Knox, a national gun-rights 
leader who has complained that the NRA has not been vigilant enough in stopping 
gun-control legislation, including California's assault-weapons ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most controversial member of CAC has been Cuban emigre Manuel 
Fernandez, who once told The Times that the "whole purpose of the recall of 
Roberti is retribution" for his weapons ban. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, Fernandez was convicted of illegally owning a machine gun.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite a recent effort by the recall movement to distance themselves from 
him, Fernandez attended a news conference of the recall leadership Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to the Fernandez conviction, Roberti campaign press secretary Staci 
Walters said: "This is just another example of the fact that the recall 
proponents have clear motives to wreak revenge on Sen. Roberti because of his 
leadership on banning assault weapons, that outgun cops and cut down kids." 
</P>
<P>
 With or without Fernandez, CAC is little more than a front for the NRA, 
according to Roberti. His backers have filed complaints with the state Fair 
Political Practices Commission, alleging that CAC violated state law by failing 
to disclose a $5,000 contribution received in 1990 from the NRA Political 
Victory Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 These complaints stemmed from CAC's 1990 campaign to block Roberti's difficult 
bid to win election to a Valley-based Senate seat.  
</P>
<P>
 Howard, now a leader of the CAC, said the failure to disclose the NRA gift was 
a technical mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez's political views have been shaped by his own brush with 
authoritarian rule as the son of a Cuban businessman who fled his homeland in 
1961 because of his political opposition to Fidel Castro. "Let's put it this 
way," Dominguez, 43, said. "I don't feel as complacent as many people do about 
the situation we're in." 
</P>
<P>
 For Dominguez, it is galling that Roberti, the leader of a legislative body 
that has seen several of its members convicted and charged with political 
corruption in recent years, can spend more than $2 million to win election to a 
seat in the Valley even though his residence is in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey, the environmental activist, shares a similar sense of outrage about 
Roberti. "It's despicable that he was able to bring his laundered political 
money and buy a seat in the Valley," Bailey said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 After attending meetings where Roberti was present, Bailey said he was shocked 
to learn that the senator did not know about prostitution problems on Sepulveda 
Boulevard and was indifferent about protecting the Sepulveda Basin from 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 "This coalition to oust Roberti includes people from the right, the left and 
the middle," Bailey said. "We don't agree on all the issues, but we are united 
in our belief that Roberti is unfit for office." 
</P>
<P>
 Also active in the coalition is Ralph Morrell, a legislative gadfly in 
Sacramento. Morrell gained considerable recognition for his efforts to force 
disclosure of how legislators spend their office budget funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrell and Ted Costa, who is the executive director of the People's Advocate, 
the group founded by tax fighter Paul Gann, recently flew to Los Angeles to 
join the recall leadership at a news conference. "I've been reassured that this 
is not a gun issue thing only," the retired Navy man said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Stites, a candidate for Los Angeles County sheriff, is another recent 
recruit to the coalition as it seeks to broaden its base. Stites, a sergeant in 
the Sheriff's Department, sensed during meetings with leaders of the recall 
campaign that the group is not dominated by anti-gun control fanatics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, that's not my gig," Stites said.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; FEMA INSPECTOR KNOWS HOW IT FEELS ON OTHER 
SIDE; RECOVERY: AFTER HURRICANE ANDREW DEVASTATED HIS KEY BISCAYNE CONDOMINIUM, 
ANDRES VILLALON DECIDED HE SHOULD HELP OTHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Andres Villalon knows what it's like to lose nearly everything precious to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time it happened was in 1960, when he fled Castro's Cuba with only 
$10 and a pregnant wife. The second time he lost everything, he says, was when 
his wife divorced him. But after Hurricane Andrew devastated his Key Biscayne 
condominium in Florida, he decided he should help others learn what he had 
learned through distressing experiences -- how to overcome personal 
catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
 So he became an inspector for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with a quirky sense of humor that comes from dealing with life's -- and 
nature's -- setbacks, Villalon is part of an unusual corps of 800 inspectors 
taking damage reports from victims of the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I have done a good job if I can get my applicant to smile," said 
the 56-year-old Villalon, who wears an "I Survived Hurricane Andrew" T-shirt as 
he surveys damaged buildings. "You have to bring a little levity in. You cannot 
be all business." 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be pretty strange to be an inspector," added inspector Don 
Walters of Missouri, Villalon's roommate at a Panorama City apartment. "We had 
one inspector who has a dog and two mountain lions that he took with him 
everywhere in Missouri." 
</P>
<P>
 This combination of eccentricity and patience seems to be a job qualification 
for a FEMA inspector. Eighteen-hour work days, irate and dishonest aid 
applicants, and being away from family for months at a time are all part of the 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 And unlike last year's Midwest floods and Hurricane Andrew, which Villalon and 
Walters both worked, the Northridge earthquake has created a unique on-the-job 
stress for inspectors. This is the first time many have had to actually share 
the terror that disaster victims felt -- in the form of aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a hurricane, you just huddle in the bathtub and, whoosh, the house flies 
away above you, and maybe you get a little wet," said Villalon, a general 
contractor who works for FEMA on request during major disasters. "Here, it's 
shaky-quaky all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that he has much time to worry about aftershocks. For Villalon, the day 
begins at 5 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 A quick check of his portable computer in his apartment, which resembles an 
FBI manhunt operation with maps and cellular phones, gives him the address of 
his next destination. So far, he has visited about 125 residences in Sylmar, 
San Fernando, Woodland Hills and Mission Hills since leaving Miami a day after 
the Jan. 17 quake. 
</P>
<P>
 One afternoon last week his destination was Woodland Hills, where he met a 
pensive, 82-year-old Edythe Yakerson and her husband, Abe, in their third-story 
apartment. Storage boxes and paper plates immediately indicated that the 
renters -- who relied on Social Security -- suffered losses in the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not asking for much," Edythe told Villalon as he recorded damage to the 
television, bookcase, dishware and other items. "We just want to get a few 
things replaced. We don't have any money for new stuff and can't afford a 
loan." 
</P>
<P>
 "I am from Miami. I went through the hurricane," Villalon told her. The 
hurricane left $45,000 in damage. "So I know what you are going through." 
</P>
<P>
 The Yakersons nodded sympathetically and seemed to relax as Villalon went on. 
"This is my brief explanation," he said. "FEMA and the Small Business 
Administration work together. In fact, they're cousins. And they have the same 
uncle -- Uncle Sam. If you qualify for a loan, SBA can give you a loan. If you 
don't, FEMA will give you money if you qualify." 
</P>
<P>
 The Yakersons seemed content with this explanation -- and the 10-day waiting 
period for an answer -- but Villalon said some applicants are less forgiving. 
And the belligerent ones, he said, are usually the dishonest ones. 
</P>
<P>
 One sign of a dishonest applicant is failure to produce a utility bill, he 
said. Another sign is demanding to know the amount of their award (which FEMA 
inspectors have no control over). During the Hurricane Andrew relief effort, 
one suspicious applicant generated an angry mob when Villalon questioned his 
aid application, forcing Villalon to flag down a passing patrol car for help. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sylmar, Villalon said a man threatened to sic his dog on him during an 
inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is typical of a guy committing fraud," Villalon said. "They think they 
can scare you into giving them benefits." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, experience has prompted Villalon to program 911 into the 
direct dial of his cellular phone. The phone -- provided by the government -- 
also allows applicants to reach him anytime, speeding up the appointment 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, this means there are fewer times to relax. Even dinner breaks 
are no escape. 
</P>
<P>
 At a steakhouse in North Hills, Villalon and Walters found themselves 
answering questions between hastily downed cups of coffee from a waitress whose 
mobile home was destroyed. An anxious couple at a nearby table glared at the 
men, easily identified by their FEMA hats and jackets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to know why you haven't been to my house yet," the blond woman shouted 
across the room. 
</P>
<P>
 Villalon simply asked what area she lived in, told her someone would be out 
there soon, and turned his cap around, hiding the letters FEMA . 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such ungrateful demands as living out of a suitcase in a motel room or 
rented apartment, and isolation from his second wife and two grown sons, 
Villalon said there is no other place he would rather spend the next several 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first disaster is excitement, it's a challenge," Villalon said. "After 
the second disaster, I started thinking -- it's not excitement. What the hell's 
exciting about being 3,000 miles away from my wife? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I started thinking. I like this. I don't do it for the money. If I'm 
able to lift somebody out of their misery, I feel good."

'THEY'RE (TRAINS) A LITTLE TALLER THAN WHAT YOU MIGHT THINK'; MAN ESCAPES DEATH 
WHEN TRAIN ROLLS OVER HIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 A 25-year-old man miraculously suffered only minor injuries Saturday when a 
freight train ran over him in Lancaster, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel Carrillo of Lancaster was lying on the tracks near Sierra Highway and 
Avenue I when a Southern Pacific freight rolled over him about 10 a.m. 
Saturday, said Ed Grantham of the Antelope Valley Sheriff's Station. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're (trains) a little taller than what you might think," Grantham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrillo was listed in fair condition Saturday afternoon at Antelope Valley 
Hospital Medical Center, where he was treated for a small head laceration he 
may have suffered before the train arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently . . . he was intoxicated and stumbled and fell and hit his head on 
the rail and just laid down inside of the train track, and the train ran 
directly over him without touching him," a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grantham said the engineer saw Carrillo on the tracks but was unable to stop 
the train, which was traveling about 45 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes about a mile to lock up the train and they went completely over 
him," Grantham said. 
</P>
<P>
 The scalp laceration must have been due to a fall, because "if the train had 
hit him, it would have killed him," Grantham said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrillo's brush with death occurred about a mile from the site of the 
apparent suicide Friday night of an unidentified 25-year-old man who ran into a 
moving Southern Pacific train, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 That incident occurred about 11:20 p.m. Friday near Sierra Highway and Avenue 
J in Lancaster.

COUNTY OFFICIALS' BENEFITS TOP $300,000; PERKS: THE 1993 COMPENSATION PACKAGES 
RISE DESPITE ACTIONS TO CUT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. PAY IS EXPECTED TO DROP THIS 
YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite taking action to cut thousands of dollars in perks, Ventura County's 
elected officials received more than $300,000 in financial benefits last year 
on top of salary increases, county records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two of the county's 10 elected officials -- Supervisors Vicky Howard and 
John K. Flynn -- received less money than the year before. That was because 
they refused to accept one of the most controversial of the perks -- seven 
weeks extra vacation pay. 
</P>
<P>
 In almost all cases, the compensation packages of the county's elected 
officials in 1993 increased -- by as much as $9,500 -- instead of declining. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were led to believe that these perks would be cut," said Lindsay Nielson, 
a Ventura lawyer who served on a citizens' panel charged with reviewing the 
perks issue. "I'm a little dumbfounded. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact of the matter is there is no change, even with all their lip 
service." 
</P>
<P>
 The county's complex system of lucrative financial benefits was quietly 
adopted by the Board of Supervisors in the 1980s, partly to avoid the public 
criticism they might have received had they simply given themselves and other 
elected officials dramatic salary raises. 
</P>
<P>
 But a major controversy over the perks flared after The Times disclosed in 
September, 1992, that the officials were receiving tens of thousands of dollars 
annually in addition to their base salaries. Under intense pressure, the 
supervisors agreed to form a citizens' panel to study the pay packages. 
</P>
<P>
 At the recommendation of the panel, the board voted on Dec. 15, 1992, to cut 
almost all the benefits while increasing base salaries -- creating what they 
called a more forthright pay system. 
</P>
<P>
 But the county counsel's office later ruled that the supervisors could not cut 
benefits that officials had already earned. 
</P>
<P>
 "They basically had an absolute right to it," said county Counsel James 
McBride. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the 10 elected officials and the county's chief administrative 
officer received a lump-sum payment last January for perks that they accrued in 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 They also received between $11,000 and $17,000 in salary increases -- meant to 
offset the loss of perks in future years -- pushing many of their pay packages 
to well over $120,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Although 1993 reflected what some called a "banner year" for most of the 
county leaders, officials cautioned that their pay will drop substantially this 
year. Officials eliminated most perks -- including the vacation bonus and 
longevity pay -- from the compensation plans this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, county officials estimate at least $20,000 could be lopped off 
some 1994 salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year was just a cleanup year," said county Auditor-Controller Thomas O. 
Mahon, whose office is responsible for monitoring how much officials earn. 
"From here on in they're not going to get (the perks). When you compare 1994 
with 1992, there will be substantial reductions." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, taxpayer advocates say they are disappointed that the officials 
received additional funds last year despite efforts to slice perks. 
</P>
<P>
 Making matters worse, advocates say, the county calculates its employees' 
retirement benefits based on their year of highest pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Since most of the elected officials earned more money in 1993 than ever 
before, those figures could be used as the basis for setting their pensions, 
possibly costing the county thousands of dollars more in retirement pay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their salaries were spiked," said Michael Saliba, the executive director of 
the Ventura County Taxpayers Assn. "To use that for basis for their retirement 
would be inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 Saliba and Nielson, who serves on the tax association's board of directors, 
said they want the county to appoint another citizens' panel to study the 
matter further. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously more work needs to be done," Nielson said. "There were tremendous 
windfalls last year. That was never the intention of the (perks) panel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think these people should be paid, but let's not play games." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maggie Kildee, however, said the county has worked out the 
glitches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know people believe I got a raise, but I didn't," Kildee said. "It's just 
because of the rollover. The increase is not really an increase." 
</P>
<P>
 According to figures released to The Times by the auditor-controller's office, 
the pay plans for the 11 top officials ranged from $75,833 to $182,471 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg remained the county's 
highest-paid official, with a base salary of $123,630 and a benefits package of 
$58,841. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his base salary, Wittenberg received $25,652 for his vacation 
benefit, a perk which automatically gave county leaders an extra seven weeks 
pay annually. 
</P>
<P>
 He also received $9,890 in longevity pay for working for the county since 
1969. In addition, he received a $6,182 bonus under the county's educational 
incentive program which rewards employees with college educations. Wittenberg 
holds a law degree. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike the elected officials, Wittenberg's pay package remained about the 
same as 1992 because the supervisors did not increase his base pay, as they did 
for themselves and the others. 
</P>
<P>
 Wittenberg, however, will continue receiving several of the perks this year. 
Overall, his pay plan for 1994 could decrease by more than $10,000, officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Board of Supervisors, meanwhile, were paid as much as $5,739 
more than the year before. While accepting perks carried over from the year 
before, they raised their base pay from $50,232 to $62,066. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors, who tied future salary raises to those of Municipal Court 
judges as set by the state, could have received a 5% raise during the year. But 
they waived the increase, citing the county's financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maria VanderKolk received the largest compensation increase in 
1993, with her pay package rising from $90,702 to $96,441, according to the 
county figures. 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk received $12,110 for the vacation perk and another $308 in 
education incentives. The county also contributed $12,266 to VanderKolk's 401-K 
plan, since she is not enrolled in the regular retirement program. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Susan Lacey received a total pay package of $89,567, about $4,000 
more than the year before. She received $11,682 in vacation pay, money she says 
she has traditionally donated to charity. 
</P>
<P>
 Kildee received $97,533 in pay and benefits, about $521 more than last year. 
She was paid $12,858 in vacation pay and another $2,839 in longevity pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard received $75,833, the lowest pay package of the county's elected 
officials. Her pay was $3,838 less than 1992. Flynn received $80,941, a $7,126 
decrease. 
</P>
<P>
 "Legally I could have accepted the money, but I didn't think it was proper for 
me to do," Flynn said. "We increased the base pay and it seemed to me that 
should have been an equitable way to take care of the whole issue. I didn't 
feel I should go beyond that." 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury received a pay package of $160,572, 
representing a $6,293 increase. His package included a $21,017 vacation bonus 
and $3,935 in longevity pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Treasurer-Tax Collector Hal Pittman's salary and benefits increased by nearly 
$9,500 to a total of $130,049. County Clerk Recorder Richard Dean received 
$127,337, about $8,400 more than 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Sheriff Larry Carpenter and Mahon did not take office until Jan. 1 
last year, they did not accrue the large benefits. As a result, Carpenter's pay 
and perks package was $135,286. Mahon earned $128,854. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradbury said most officials were surprised that their pay actually went up, 
instead of decreasing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anyone realized what was happening," Bradbury said in an 
interview last week. "Everyone was complaining about losing money. I don't 
think anyone anticipated it would be to their benefit." Michael D. Bradbury

 Christmas Bird Count Tally -- South Coast Audubon, a chapter of the National 
Audubon Society, has tallied the results of its first Christmas Bird Count. 
</P>
<P>
 The count, held Dec. 18, was part of a nationwide effort to conduct a census 
of the bird population. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 19,000 individual birds and 130 species were counted in the South 
Coast Audubon effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The count was held in the following areas: Arroyo Trabuco and Saddleback; 
Laguna Niguel Regional Park and Aliso Creek; San Juan Creek; Dana Point and 
Capistrano Bay; San Clemente parks and golf courses; Camp Pendleton; Rancho 
Mission Viejo Co. and Conservancy; and Ronald W. Caspers Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Gulls, European starlings and yellow-rumped warblers were the species spotted 
most often, but there were some unexpected sightings, too, according to South 
Coast Audubon. 
</P>
<P>
 The ponds behind Saddleback Community College yielded many varieties of duck 
species, including cinnamon teals, green-winged teals, American widgeons, 
greater scaups and one bufflehead. 
</P>
<P>
 Two blue-gray gnatcatchers were seen along San Juan Creek. California 
gnatcatchers were seen in several areas but not in great numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest number of cactus wrens were counted in Ronald W. Caspers Regional 
Park. The park area also yielded surprise sightings of a large number of lark 
sparrows, a flock of mountain chickadees and mountain bluebirds. 
</P>
<P>
 There were many sightings of hawks and falcons, with American kestrels leading 
the way. White-tailed kites were spotted in many areas, but northern harrier 
sightings were not as common. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one individual of the following species was spotted during the count: 
western grebe, Clark's grebe, bufflehead, red-breasted merganser, zone-tailed 
hawk, rough-tailed hawk, golden eagle, merlin, common moorhen, western 
sandpiper, lesser nighthawk, common poorwill.

CAMPUS' TINY LIBRARY TO GET 4 MORE FLOORS IN EXPANSION; RENOVATION: CAL STATE 
FULLERTON STUDENTS WILL BE ABLE TO USE INTERACTIVE VIDEOS AND CD-ROMS, AND SEE 
THE OUTSIDE WORLD FROM GLASS WALLS BY 1996. 
</P>

 For Cal State Fullerton students, finals are a time to dread entering the 
university library. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 649 out of 25,000 students can use cubicles with terminals and 
computerized library catalogues at any one time. Many students sit on the 
floor. No outside light penetrates the tiny windows of the two-story building. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was awful," said Patricia Bril, acting associate university librarian. 
"Within the CSU system, ours was the most deficient in library space." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials hope the worst is behind them. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, administrators held a ground-breaking ceremony to mark the 
construction of the nearly $30-million expansion expected to add four more 
floors to the university library by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion will bring $4.6 million in new computer technology, updating the 
library's computer system and audio-visual equipment, from CD-ROMs to 
interactive videos and more computer stations. 
</P>
<P>
 New technology will allow students to send digital images and data throughout 
the campus via computer, said Jean Dippel, the university's associate vice 
president for information and telecommunications. "Technology has advanced so 
much -- it's going to be very aggressive out there," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only will there be more access to CD-ROMs -- computer programs that turn a 
terminal into a mock TV screen -- and more sophisticated on-line catalogues, 
there also will be more space for students to use them. 
</P>
<P>
 The new floors, designed by Albert C. Martin & Associates of Irvine, will 
include a wall of glass on the north side, offering what students never had in 
the library before -- a view of Memorial Grove, a park area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unlike the typical architecture on campus, this will have a major amount of 
glass . . . allowing light to come in and people to study in an open 
environment," said campus spokesman Jerry Keating. 
</P>
<P>
 The construction project is the result of an ongoing campaign to secure state 
money to upgrade the library. 
</P>
<P>
 It took years to get there. Administrators and faculty members had been 
talking about the need to expand the 28-year-old structure when Bril began 
working there 23 years ago, she said. The existing library building wasn't 
built in anticipation of the information age, with all its electronics, 
computers and heavy wiring. 
</P>
<P>
 State legislators agreed in 1992 to let the university use $25 million in 
revenue bonds to pay for the expansion. Another $4.6 million in bonds was made 
available for the new technology.

TREASURE CHEST OPENS STUDENTS' MINDS TO CULTURES; EDUCATION: AFRICAN AND BLACK 
AMERICAN HISTORY, CRAFTS AND LITERATURE ARE VIVIDLY EXPOSED IN CLASSROOMS IN A 
DISPLAY ORGANIZED BY THE MULTICULTURAL ARTS COUNCIL. 
</P>

<P>
 Among the parades, cultural fairs and other celebrations marking Black History 
Month, some Orange County youngsters may receive their most vivid exposure to 
the African and African American culture from a display in their schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The African American Treasure Chest, a collection of 50 items depicting the 
history and culture of Africans and black Americans, has circulated through 
county classrooms since 1987. The display includes an African drum, mask, 
shield, spear, and bracelet, along with books, inventions, crafts and 
literature of black Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have little knowledge of African American history in Orange County," 
said Nancy King, a college professor and vice president of the Multicultural 
Arts Council of Orange County, a 9-year-old group that tries to promote 
cultural awareness. "One of the greatest complaints I've always had as an 
educator is that minority history is not taught in schools." 
</P>
<P>
 To address that shortcoming, a group of volunteers gathered the items and 
wrote the teaching materials that accompany them. Valued at approximately 
$2,000, the African American Treasure Chest's contents are the most elaborate 
of nine separate collections of materials illustrating the cultures of 
different ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Included among the other collections, also organized by the Multicultural Arts 
Council, are displays on Chinese, Iranian, Mexican and Vietnamese cultures. 
Each chest also includes material on contributions made by Americans with 
heritages in those lands, said Helen Lin, the volunteer chairwoman of the 
treasure chest committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The African American Treasure Chest comes with written materials to help the 
teachers present the array of information on the culture. The information was 
compiled by the African American Council, a subgroup of the Multicultural Arts 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "We encourage the teachers to present the chest. That's why we spent years 
developing the materials," Lin said. "We don't want it to be like a museum, 
where they walk through and that's it. The purpose is for the teacher to be 
involved.". 
</P>
<P>
 The material is exhibited in many schools each February during Black History 
Month observances. For the African American collection -- but not all the 
others -- volunteers are available to present the material. 
</P>
<P>
 William E. Fanning Elementary's principal, David Biniasz, said virtually all 
22 teachers in his school have brought their classes to see the collection. In 
general, he said, students and staff alike have been receptive to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the instructional guides, teachers can be unfamiliar with the 
treasure chest's contents. Last Thursday, for example, a second-grade teacher 
largely overlooked material from African Americans, telling her class "this 
treasure chest comes from Africa. Who knows where Africa is?" 
</P>
<P>
 Noting the treasure chest's Kwanzaa display, the teacher told her students, 
"The Africans celebrate Kwanzaa." On the plexiglass above the display was a 
sheet explaining that Kwanzaa is a holiday that originated in the United States 
28 years ago, the creation of a Cal State Long Beach professor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to admit most of my teachers didn't have the opportunity to read the 
accompanying material (placed around the exhibit) and digest that material. 
(The teacher) came to me and felt badly that (portions of her talk were) 
inaccurate. She said she hadn't had a lot of time to prepare," Biniasz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Davida Parham, a founding member of the African American Council who helped 
prepare the treasure chest and the written materials that describe its 
contents, said she was "concerned about the chest being lent out to school 
districts and untruths being spoken with it. I think (it) is best displayed 
when it comes with a volunteer who has worked in developing it and is familiar 
with the curriculum plan that goes with (it)." 
</P>
<P>
 Biniasz said he chose not to have a volunteer present the material because "we 
don't have one big assembly hall, and we thought it might be better to have an 
individual experience . . . a personal touch." 
</P>
<P>
 King said she wants to ensure that teachers receive more thorough instruction 
from the Multicultural Arts Council before presenting the treasure chest, and 
will bring the matter to the its board of directors.

FLUTTERING FLAGS, FIRECRACKERS BRING EAST AND WEST TO TET 
</P>

 As flags of the United States and the former Republic of Vietnam snapped 
side-by-side in the breeze at Golden West College on Saturday, a beaming Loni 
Nguyen spoke only of celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first day of a two-day festival celebrating Tet, the Vietnamese 
lunar new year, and despite the week's political controversy, Nguyen, like 
thousands of others streaming about the decorated campus athletic field, was 
here to celebrate. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a time for everyone to come and enjoy themselves," said Nguyen, 23, a 
student at Coastline Community College and a member of the Vietnamese student 
association that staged Saturday's festivities. "We've been up all night 
preparing for this . . . because it's fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Politics and President Clinton's controversial decision to lift the embargo 
against Vietnam last week were mentioned in passing by an array of speakers. A 
plane passed over the carnival-like festivities towing a banner that 
read:"Human Rights -- Freedom for Vietnam." Protests were occurring several 
miles away in Little Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
 But for most of the crowd, including Westminster City Councilman Tony Lam, Tet 
is a time to party, not pontificate. Lam, the first Vietnamese American elected 
to public office in the United States, was stopped by well-wishers everywhere 
he went. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very emotional today," said Lam after speaking to the crowd. "It is 
fantastic to see the Vietnamese community still pulling together and putting on 
a show like this. It helps to maintain our cultural heritage and at the same 
time to mesh our culture with America." 
</P>
<P>
 Lam said he plans to enjoy himself perhaps all the way through Thursday, which 
is actually the start of the Year of the Dog. 
</P>
<P>
 "The farmers in Vietnam, sometimes they celebrate Tet for a month," he said 
with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West College officials said about 50,000 people attended the Tet 
festivities last year and predicted that as many as 70,000 might come this 
year, the fifth year the college has hosted the event. It is the only ethnic 
festival held in Huntington Beach, said Wendy D. Weber, Golden West College's 
director of public relations. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid the carnival rides and booths, the crowd was a mixture of races and 
colors. But the atmosphere, the traditional ao dai dresses, the smells and the 
voices were unmistakably Asian. 
</P>
<P>
 Vietnamese music blared from loudspeakers at various booths near two 
boisterous volleyball games. Skewered chicken, beef and meatballs sizzled on 
makeshift outdoor grills, while hawkers offered visitors dried squid, papaya, 
egg roll and the sweet juice of sugar cane squeezed to order and poured over 
ice. 
</P>
<P>
 Hung Huynh, 17, an Explorer Scout and senior at Garden Grove High School, 
spoke of the meaning of Tet as his fellow Scouts handed out bags of steamed 
peanuts. Tet is a time for renewal and a fresh start, Huynh said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our part of the world, the new year means we clean out the whole house and 
wash all the clothes. Everything is new," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 An old Tet custom has the oldest child run out the back door and then knock on 
the front door, allowing his parents to let him in, Huynh said. "It brings good 
luck," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, Huynh said, he is concerned about what is going on in Vietnam, but he 
supports the lifting of the embargo and wants more exchange with his native 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a step forward. We have to start somewhere," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tet festival continues at Golden West College today from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m.

MAN KILLED BY POLICEMAN IN SANTA ANA IS IDENTIFIED; CRIME: OFFICER WHO SHOT 
DEAD THE 18-YEAR-OLD FROM CORONA IS NOT NAMED.

<P>
 The man who was shot and killed by a police officer during a foot chase Friday 
evening was identified Saturday as Omar Garcia, 18, of Corona. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Paul M. Walters, citing department policy, said he would not 
release the name of the veteran officer who killed Garcia when, according to 
police, the teen-ager turned and pulled a gun on the officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting took place about 5 p.m. Friday in the 900 block of West Russell 
Avenue, after police stopped a 1964 Chevrolet that matched the description of a 
car believed to be involved in an earlier drive-by shooting, Sgt. Dick Faust 
said. No one was injured in the drive-by shooting, Faust said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the lone officer halted the vehicle, two passengers fled in different 
directions, Faust said. The officer followed Garcia, a gang member, as the 
teen-ager climbed a fence at Martin Elementary School, then pulled out a 
semiautomatic handgun as he turned to face the officer, Faust said. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer fired from a distance of about 30 feet and hit the teen-ager in 
the chest, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager ran a short distance, dropped the handgun and collapsed, Faust 
said. He was pronounced dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The other man who fled the vehicle was arrested after a door-to-door search of 
an eight-square block area. Police did not release his name Saturday but said 
he was arrested for outstanding warrants. The driver of the vehicle, Edwardo 
Villamar, 22, of Santa Ana, was detained for questioning, Faust said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters said the incident is under investigation by the Orange County district 
attorney's office, which routinely handles officer-involved shootings. The 
chief declined to comment further.

PARENTS PUSH FOR IMPROVED SCHOOL SAFETY; VIOLENCE: THE SLAYING OF ONE STUDENT 
IN SIMI VALLEY AND WOUNDING OF THREE IN THOUSAND OAKS PROMPT DEMANDS FOR ADDED 
SECURITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the wake of two incidents of after-school violence that left one student 
dead in Simi Valley and three wounded in Thousand Oaks this past week, alarmed 
parents and students are crying out for new measures to boost school safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley officials are rushing to form a task force that will suggest new 
safety measures for the district and particularly Valley View Junior High, 
where police said 14-year-old Chad Hubbard was stabbed to death Tuesday by 
13-year-old Phillip Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 And Thousand Oaks officials are responding to the shooting of three Westlake 
High students in a melee Thursday by pushing ahead with the recommendations of 
recently formed school safety committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Stricter discipline, additional security cameras, an increased parent presence 
at the schools, and even tougher dress codes are among the new approaches being 
considered in the two cities. 
</P>
<P>
 As Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks school officials grapple with possible 
solutions to school violence, they are tracing steps covered by officials at 
western Ventura County schools, which have a longer history of schoolyard 
shootings and stabbings. 
</P>
<P>
 Campus violence prompted Oxnard last year to use hand-held metal detectors for 
random searches of high school students, and Ventura educators set up a 
telephone hot line for students to anonymously report on classmates carrying 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 By expelling dozens of students caught with knives and guns over the past two 
years, school administrators in Ventura and Oxnard have put pupils on notice 
about the consequences of carrying weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts on school safety say Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks have lagged behind 
the west county in aggressively working to avert school violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the perception that we don't have the problem here," said Ronald 
Stephens, executive director of the National School Safety Center, a federally 
funded agency based in Westlake. "It's a denial-type mode." 
</P>
<P>
 The denial was fed, Stephens said, by Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks being 
named in recent years as two of the safest U. S. cities with populations of 
more than 100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But the stunning news of the stabbing death at a Simi Valley junior high 
sobered many parents, who turned hostile when school officials sought to defuse 
concern by repeatedly referring to the slaying as "an isolated incident." 
</P>
<P>
 At a public forum Thursday night crammed with hundreds of agitated parents, 
Simi Valley Supt. Mary Beth Wolford and other school officials were shouted 
down by residents demanding action from the district. 
</P>
<P>
 And parent Glenn Woodbury announced Friday that he and other residents are 
forming a group called Safety for Our Students that will work separately from 
the district's task force. "We want something that parents can have control 
over," Woodbury said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley school officials acknowledged last week that educators and parents 
shared a complacency about the threat of big-city violence reaching their 
school grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, after a student at Reseda High School in the San Fernando Valley 
was killed on campus, some parents in eastern Simi Valley briefly became 
anxious that the violence would spill into their city, Parks said. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Simi Valley High School responded to the concerns by holding a 
meeting on school safety, only about five people showed up, Parks said. "That's 
a good example of denial." 
</P>
<P>
 In Thousand Oaks, school officials disagreed with Stephens' contention that 
the community has ignored the threat of campus violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district is well aware of violence within our community," said Richard 
Simpson, assistant superintendent of the Conejo Valley Unified School District. 
"We've seen increasing violence in our community coming for some time." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson noted the shooting of the Westlake High students occurred off campus 
and after school. Students David Behling, Scott Smith and Jarad Kline were shot 
at noon Thursday just outside Thousand Oaks' North Ranch Park, where the three 
youths and about a dozen friends had gathered to watch a planned fistfight 
between a junior football player and a sophomore at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the violence occurred after the sophomore arrived with several 
carloads of older youths, one of whom then opened fire on friends of the 
football player. Police said Friday that many of the youths in the cars were 
not Westlake High students. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the shooting, the Conejo Valley school district had formed school 
safety committees at each of the district's 26 schools, Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the committees have already made recommendations for improving 
security on school grounds, including purchasing new camcorders and portable 
telephones for use by school officials. 
</P>
<P>
 But Simpson said he does not see that school officials could have done 
anything differently to avert Thursday's violence. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials had already tried to end the long-running feud between the 
sophomore and junior Curtis Simmons, whose planned fistfight led to the 
bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
 Both boys were suspended after a fistfight last year. When rumors circulated 
recently that the two were planning to face off again, officials called the 
students into the school office and warned them against violence. 
</P>
<P>
 School administrators also searched both boys' lockers when they heard rumors 
that one had obtained a gun. But the searches turned up nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson said parents can help educators curb violence on campus by taking a 
more active role in their children's activities. "What we need is a much more 
aggressive response from our community and from parents," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and community members also were called upon to get more involved in 
Ventura schools last year after Ventura High School football player Jesse 
Strobel was knifed to death in downtown Ventura on a Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the shooting of the Westlake High School students, Strobel's slaying 
occurred off campus and after school hours. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura school officials, nevertheless, treated the incident as a school 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura educators cracked down on students carrying weapons, expelling 13 
students in the first five months of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, a new state law began requiring schools to expel students caught 
with weapons. Ventura has pursued the policy aggressively, setting up a 
telephone hot line for anonymous tips and encouraging students to help look out 
for campus safety.  
</P>
<P>
 Ventura officials said they believe their strict approach has caught the 
attention of students. So far this school year, the district has expelled three 
students for possessing weapons and four other cases are pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura school officials also added new security guards to each of the high 
school campuses. And this year, Ventura school Supt. Joseph Spirito has 
launched a sweeping character-development program to teach moral values such as 
tolerance and patience. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these measures, an 18-year-old Buena High School student was stabbed 
by a 17-year-old classmate in a scuffle in the school parking lot a few months 
after Strobel's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena High School Principal Jaime Castellanos said when he heard about the 
Westlake High School shooting he was reminded of past violence at his school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got to thinking again, 'My God. That's the kind of thing that can happen 
anytime, anywhere, anyplace,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard Union High School District has come down even harder than Ventura 
on students who carry weapons to campus. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to expelling students caught with knives or guns, the district's 
five high schools in Oxnard and Camarillo use metal detectors to conduct random 
weapons searches in two classes per school each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard High School Principal Rick Rezinas credited the weapons searches with 
helping to reduce violence among students and creating a more secure atmosphere 
on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key difference is that we're trying to solve problems before they 
happen," he said. "The metal detectors are part of that. The kids feel that 
someone cares about their safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard High School has not always been peaceful. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the school was rocked by a riot when dozens of black and Latino 
students at the school, some wielding chains and pipes, came to blows. 
</P>
<P>
 And another Oxnard district school -- Channel Islands High -- was the last 
site of a schoolyard slaying before the stabbing in Simi Valley last week. In 
November, 1989, Manuel (Deadeye) Rodriguez shouted gang slogans outside the 
high school and was shot to death by Arnel Salagubang, a member of a rival 
gang.

 Despite the success of weapons searches at Oxnard schools, most other county 
school districts are reluctant to go to that length to combat violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks officials said they already have metal detectors on high school 
campuses but use them only when they have reason to believe a student is 
carrying a knife or gun. 
</P>
<P>
 And Simi Valley officials did not include the use of metal detectors among the 
list of safety measures they are considering for their schools.

MORE THAN 700 GATHER TO MOURN SLAIN YOUTH; FUNERAL: CHAD HUBBARD, 14, IS 
REMEMBERED AS A BOY WITH CHARISMA, KINDNESS AND A LIFE TRAGICALLY CUT SHORT.

 More than 700 mourners crowded a Simi Valley church Saturday to say goodby to 
Chad Patrick Hubbard, a popular, gregarious 14-year-old stabbed to death by a 
classmate last week as he waited for the school bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chad Hubbard was 14 years old, and that is a time for living, not dying," Bob 
Eichele, the pastor who once confirmed Chad, said at the boy's funeral service. 
"What do you say to all of this, how do you act, when everything is so tragic, 
so sad and so heart-wrenching?" 
</P>
<P>
 Services were held at Simi Covenant Church because Our Saviour Lutheran 
Church, where the Hubbards worshiped and where Eichele presides, was not large 
enough to hold the mourners. 
</P>
<P>
 And still, at Simi Covenant, mourners packed the outer aisles and spilled out 
the side and back doors Saturday morning. Friends and classmates said Chad -- a 
baseball pitcher and basketball player at Valley View Junior High School -- was 
the kind of boy whom the other guys liked and admired and the girls wanted to 
date. 
</P>
<P>
 "His smile -- he had a great smile," said a friend of Chad. "No matter where 
he went, he lit up the room." 
</P>
<P>
 Classmates said most of the students in the ninth grade at Valley View either 
knew Chad or knew of him, because of his charismatic, generous manner, good 
looks and unflagging friendliness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew him by his reputation -- how nice he was, and how he made people feel 
welcome," said Valley View ninth-grader Kim Carder, 15. "He was really 
good-looking, but he wasn't conceited or anything about the way he looked. 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't deserve this," she said. "It's a real waste." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends said Chad had only one enemy -- Phillip Hernandez, the 13-year-old 
accused of stabbing Chad during a scuffle Tuesday afternoon. The two had a 
running feud that escalated into a fistfight near the school bus stop at the 
campus, friends said. The fight ended with Chad stabbed in the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, who has been charged with murder, is scheduled to be arraigned Feb. 
18 in Ventura County Superior Court. He will stay until then at county Juvenile 
Hall after a judge denied his lawyer's request Friday to release him to the 
custody of his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Chad's friends and relatives wondered how they would pick up the 
pieces of their lives and go forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just devastated," said George Miller, Chad's great-uncle and a deacon at 
a Roman Catholic diocese in San Diego, who read Bible verses in a breaking 
voice at the service. "This is a tremendous loss to our family, and I still 
can't believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends and other relatives surrounded Chad's mother, Jackie; father, Scott; 
brothers Ryan, 10, and Robbie, 5, and sister Danielle, 7, at the conclusion of 
the funeral service, standing for about 30 minutes in a quiet cluster of 
weeping and hugging. 
</P>
<P>
 "He taught me about baseball, how to do the right swing and everything," Ryan 
said of his older brother. "I admired how he never gave up on anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan said his parents have invited Chad's friends to write messages for their 
son on the walls of his room, leaving the once-plain surfaces covered in 
pen-written notes. "I wrote him that 'Legends never die,' " Ryan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, at the graveside service at Assumption Cemetery, Jackie Hubbard, a lab 
assistant at Amgen in Newbury Park, kissed the casket as she approached it to 
lay a rose on it. "My baby," she sobbed, throwing her arms over the casket's 
top. "I love you." 
</P>
<P>
 During the service, members of the school's basketball team presented the 
family with Chad's team jersey, mounted and framed, which Chad's father, a 
drywall finisher, held and looked at on and off throughout the service. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Ryan stood with other mourners by the casket for more than an hour, 
laying his head on its baby blue surface and talking to the brother he had 
lost. Relatives said he was asking Chad to forgive him for some of the names he 
had called him over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents of other Valley View students said news of the slaying shook them to 
the core. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just horrified," said Kathee Davis, whose son, Cody, plays second base on 
the junior varsity team for which Chad pitched. "You can never imagine sending 
your child to school and then never seeing him again." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Carder's father, Stan, a Simi Valley minister, said Chad's death not only 
worries parents, but haunts the boy's classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes you feel very concerned for your children," Carder said. "But also, 
it's a hard dose of reality for kids at 14 years old to learn. This isn't 
Hollywood, where they come back to life. This is the end." 
</P>
<P>
 During the funeral service, Eichele asked the mourners to try to channel their 
sorrow and anger toward such ends as making Simi Valley a safer community.  
</P>
<P>
 "This kind of senseless, mindless violence and killing is a cancer and a 
powerful force to break down families and schools and communities," he said. 
"It is our challenge to correct this terrible and horrible situation. . . . The 
greatest gift you can give to the Hubbard family is that you learn to open the 
clenched fist." 
</P>
<P>
 Eichele also reminded the mourners that Chad will never feel hurt or fear 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all take comfort in the fact that Chad has a safe place to shoot his jump 
shot and throw his fast ball," he said. "For now and forever."

ARMORED HATS ADORNED SOVIET BIGWIGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It turns out that Soviet leaders were even more hard-headed than the world 
thought. Their big fur hats were lined with steel. 
</P>
<P>
 On Soviet holidays, members of the ruling Politburo used to stand rigidly on 
Lenin's tomb in Red Square, watching tanks and missiles stream by in military 
parades. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe they looked so stiff because of the weight of their armored headgear, a 
Russian newspaper suggested Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The special hats were custom-made on orders from the Central Committee of the 
Communist Party by a defense factory that also manufactured standard-issue army 
helmets. 
</P>
<P>
 The hats, called "shapki" in Russian, usually were made form the prized fur of 
baby lambs, Siberian muskrats or young reindeer. Metal plates hidden under the 
fur were meant to protect the Communist bigwigs from assassination.

VALLEY BRIEFING: AFRICAN AMERICAN PROFILE; A SMALL, VIBRANT COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 African Americans have never been a large segment of the San Fernando Valley's 
population, and in recent years their numbers have stayed relatively constant 
even as other ethnic communities in the Valley rose or fell. African Americans 
make up about 4% of the Valley population, compared to 10.6% of the population 
countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the black population is dispersed throughout the Valley, many African 
Americans are unified by their membership at several small and vibrant 
northeast Valley churches. Today, one of those congregations, Parks Chapel AME 
Church, will break ground for a $1-million church building in Pacoima. The 
Paradise Church of God in Christ hopes to move into a new facility, also in 
Pacoima, next month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hillery T. Broadus Elementary School in Pacoima is named after the 
patriarch of the Broadus clan, a well-known African American family active in 
church and social affairs in the northeast Valley for decades. Percentage of 
Valley Population 
</P>
<P>
 The Valley's African American population changed little over the last decade 
even as the demographics of other ethnic groups in the Valley changed 
dramatically. Statistical Portrait 
</P>
<P>
 Although fewer African Americans in the Valley have a bachelor's degree 
compared to Los Angeles County overall, Valley blacks are more likely to own 
their own home, and are less likely to live below the poverty line, according 
to the 1990 census. A look at how the Valley's African American community 
compares with blacks elsewhere and with the county as a whole: 04,35,08,15,16 
Valley Los Angeles Los Angeles Blacks County Blacks County Overall Population 
73,851 990,406 8.9 million % of Population 4% 10.6% NA Population Growth

* Top Black Communities 
</P>
<P>
 The 1980 census found that blacks made up 17% of the population in Arleta and 
Pacoima, making the two communities the center of the Valley's black 
population. But over the next decade, the black population in Arleta-Pacoima 
shrank to 9%, largely due to rise of the Latino population. The top six Valley 
black communities: 
</P>
<P>
 Arleta-Pacoima: 8,372 (9%) Mission Hills-Panorama City-North Hills: 7,242 (7%) 
Van Nuys-North Sherman Oaks: 6,652 (5%) North Hollywood: 5,146 (4%) 
Sunland-Tujunga: 2,530 (5%) Sylmar: 2,446 (4%) * 
</P>
<P>
 The African-American community is spread throughout the Valley, creating 
organizational obstacles for black community leaders: 
</P>
<P>
 "The main challenge (is creating) a sense of cohesiveness. It's not that we 
don't want to be cohesive, but being separate little pockets all over is a 
hindrance, especially from a political standpoint. Geographically we are at a 
disadvantage."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; SHAKING WANES BUT THE TALES OF TERROR REMAIN; 
DISASTER: THE QUAKE WAS FELT BY MANY, BUT THE STORIES THAT HAVE EMERGED ARE AS 
INDIVIDUAL AS THE PEOPLE WHO SURVIVED, AND WILL LAST BEYOND THE NEXT 
AFTERSHOCK.

<P>
 The rumbling, rocking and rolling from the Northridge earthquake still hasn't 
stopped -- and neither have the incessant questions asked of local residents 
from frantic friends and relatives around the world: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "What does an earthquake of that magnitude feel like?" 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 6.6 temblor struck -- followed by countless aftershocks from mere 
shimmers to real shakers -- survivors across the San Fernando Valley and 
elsewhere have used a colorful, often dread-inspired lexicon to describe the 
quake that hit literally beneath their feet. 
</P>
<P>
 And it wasn't just their proximity to the fault line that figured prominently 
in the earthquake experience of many residents. It was the backgrounds they 
brought to the event that also colored their tales. 
</P>
<P>
 Several East Coast transplants compared the trembling to being on the platform 
of a major subway station, feeling the frightening force of a train 10 sizes 
too big coming at them, refusing to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like Boom! Boom! Boom! " said native New Yorker Elizabeth Teicher, 
whose Encino condominium was condemned after the quake. "It was one subway 
train after another. It was terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 Coastal dwellers used terms that applied to their own world: Many described 
the earth's movement as like riding a surfboard in their bedrooms, their house 
feeling the ebb and flow of a major ocean wave. 
</P>
<P>
 Small children described monsters -- like those that might crawl out from 
under their beds at night -- picking up their homes and shaking everything 
inside. From the religious community came descriptions such as the "hand of God 
reaching down" to rattle houses, lives and nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 "People draw from their own pasts to describe even the newest of traumas," 
said Dr. Peter Swerdlick, a psychiatrist and medical director of the San 
Fernando Valley Treatment Center for Anxieties. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fear makes them think, sometimes even more creatively. And many people are 
still afraid. I have patients who are still rushing their bowel movements 
because they're afraid the next quake is going to catch them on the toilet." 
</P>
<P>
 Some survivors described feeling like Dorothy in "The Wizard of Oz" when her 
entire house took its fantastic flight. Still others described a house 
possessed, kitchen cupboards flying open, emptying their contents onto linoleum 
floors, some of which became flooded with a soupy mixture of Jack Daniels, 
vinegar and hot sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who were awake when the 4:31 a.m. quake hit described the weird 
sensation of at first hearing the rumble, like a clap of thunder or herd of 
animals thundering toward them on an open plain. Then the room began to shake 
with a topsy-turvy, up-and-down, back-and-forth, frenzy, the mayhem getting 
stronger and stronger, reaching its unsettling peak before finally easing off a 
seeming eternity later. 
</P>
<P>
 Others said they felt like they were punched in the darkness. They felt the 
quake was only happening to them, not millions of others around them as well. 
</P>
<P>
 There were other images -- some terrible, some as manic and breathless as 
describing a roller coaster ride in the dark: "It felt like a truck had smashed 
into the side of our house," said several residents who lived near the quake's 
epicenter. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one Van Nuys resident said he wasn't sure if he was being jolted by 
an earthquake or whether it was indeed World War III unleashed upon the land -- 
Armageddon at last. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know those movies, those re-creations of atomic blasts?" he said. "Well, 
that's exactly what was going through my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in the aftermath of the quake, images of the war's destruction were 
impressed upon the minds of many people. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days following the Jan. 17 natural disaster, amazed state geologists 
reported that the Northridge temblor may have shaken the ground far more 
violently for a sustained period than any earthquake ever recorded. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists who measured the quake said instruments on the ground found that 
the earth moved with extraordinary force -- far more than they previously 
believed possible in a 6.6 magnitude quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the force was enough to collapse apartment buildings like concrete 
pancakes. At one local hospital, a patient undergoing stomach surgery at the 
time of the initial quake was thrown from the operating table and disconnected 
from this anesthesia. As the lights went out, panicked doctors scrambled to 
replace the man on the table and immediately abort the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. William Bakun, geophysicist for U.S. Geological Survey, said several 
reasons accounted for the violent shaking, in addition to the fact that this 
was a major quake hitting directly beneath a metropolitan area. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than fault lines moving against one another, this temblor had one side 
moving up and over the opposing fault line, resulting in the up-and-down 
movement, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This earthquake had very large vertical accelerations, which lasted several 
seconds. That's unusual. We've never recorded them," he said. "As a result, the 
ground is moving up and down, rather than just side to side. That might explain 
some of the characterizations of this event because they were sensations that 
few of us had ever felt before." 
</P>
<P>
 An earthquake's trembling can be likened to a rock being thrown into a pool of 
water. The people nearest the epicenter feel the most violent jolt, as though 
they are part of the water being displaced by the rock. Then the trembling 
travels away from the epicenter like the waves moving away from the spot where 
the rock hit the water. 
</P>
<P>
 It's for this reason, scientists say, that people farther away from the 
quake's source feel only a slight rolling motion -- one that decreases over 
distance, like the waves in a pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "However, the makeup of the earth isn't static like the water in that 
description," Bakun said. "There are rock formations that distort the spread of 
the energy, blocking it, sending it in different directions, sometimes back on 
itself -- which is why the shaking is a very unpredictable thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say the reason people believe they can hear an earthquake coming is 
that the temblor sends off sound waves that travel faster than the motion of 
the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 But while most people can articulate what they feel during an earthquake, one 
quake consultant and author says they don't always exactly know what it is 
they're describing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people are confused between the concepts of magnitude and intensity -- 
especially journalists," said Peter Yanev, chairman of EQE International, a 
firm that consults in earthquake risk analysis, and author of the 1974 real 
estate guide "Piece of Mind in Earthquake Country." 
</P>
<P>
 "I recently described it this way to a business reporter: The magnitude is the 
Dow Jones average of the entire event. The intensity is how your individual 
stock did that day, or what you felt in relation to how far you were from the 
epicenter." 
</P>
<P>
 Kate Hutton, a seismologist at Caltech, said scientists are obviously more 
technical in their descriptions of quakes and instead find themselves counting 
silently to measure the length of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Oxnard Street Elementary School in North Hollywood, they don't bother 
counting -- they head right for the space beneath their desks. All week, 
teachers at the school drilled students in earthquake response. Some described 
the quake to rock-music-crazy students as "the Earth doing the twist." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Cold War children from an earlier era, they practiced scrambling under 
desks and covering their heads, some taking the exercise as a joke, others with 
worried looks in their eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother told me that Mother Nature was responsible for all this damage," 
first-grader Travis Lamm said. "But I don't even know who Mother Nature is." 
</P>
<P>
 In many classrooms, children drew their impressions of the quake. Some drew 
volcanoes ripping through the ground. Others colored monsters breaking freeways 
in half, or trees ripped out by their roots. 
</P>
<P>
 With the caption "See the earthquake! It moves things!" Lamm drew a chaotic 
scene of both cars and people being swept into the air and buildings cracking. 
At the top of the illustration appeared an image no doubt appreciated by both 
surviving child and adult alike the day the big quake hit: The sun was weeping. 
Tears streamed down its face.

POLICE CHASE STOLEN BIG RIG FOR 90 MINUTES, HOLD DRIVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Santa Ana man driving a stolen big rig truck loaded with health food 
supplies led police from at least five agencies on a 90-minute chase through 
Orange County on Saturday before he surrendered without incident, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Lee Gray, 35, was arrested at 4:58 p.m. after he pulled the 18-wheeler 
over on West La Palma Avenue near Euclid Street and gave himself up, California 
Highway Patrol Officer Angel Johnson said. Gray was booked into the Orange 
County Jail on suspicion of vehicle theft, hit and run and evading arrest. Bail 
was set at $10,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The spokeswoman said Gray managed to impress some of the officers trailing him 
with his driving skills, even though he ran over a curb at the beginning of the 
chase and flattened two of the truck's rear tires. "They said he was a pretty 
good big rig driver," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man later told officers he gave himself up because he did not want to be 
hurt, she said. The truck apparently was carrying a full load of diesel fuel 
and could have continued running for quite a while longer before running out of 
fuel, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said the truck, a 1992 Peterbilt owned by Victory Express of Medway, 
Ohio, was reported stolen from a truck stop in Ontario about 10 p.m. Friday. It 
was loaded with vitamins and other health food supplies valued at $500,000, she 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 The truck was equipped with a locater system, which allowed police to find it, 
abandoned, at 6th and Mabury streets in Santa Ana early Saturday. CHP officers 
conducting surveillance on the truck saw Gray, along with a woman and small 
child, approach it about 2:45 p.m., climb in and drive away, Johnson said.  
</P>
<P>
 The officers then tried to stop Gray in a supermarket parking lot at 17th 
Street and Grand Avenue in Santa Ana about 3:15 p.m. Gray let the passengers 
out and fled, driving the vehicle over a curb and flattening two rear tires in 
the process, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the duration of the pursuit and the many miles covered, there were no 
injuries reported. Gray struck two parked cars during the chase but neither 
vehicle was occupied, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The chase, which rarely exceeded posted speed limits, spilled at times onto 
three freeways -- the Costa Mesa, Santa Ana and Riverside -- and numerous 
surface streets in Anaheim, Cypress and Santa Ana. Police from all three 
cities, as well as Westminster, were involved at various points, Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators did not know whether Gray had stolen the vehicle from the truck 
stop, she said.

QUAKE RELIEF SERVED WITH FINE CHINA TO VICTIMS; ASSISTANCE: A SANTA MARIA MAKER 
OF PORCELAIN WARES HAS DONATED 8,000 PLATES, CUPS AND SAUCERS FOR THOSE WHO 
LOST DISHES IN THE TEMBLOR. 
</P>

<P>
 The Salvation Army has always provided emergency supplies and relief after a 
disaster -- but fine china? 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to Golden State Porcelain Inc. of Santa Maria, that's exactly what may 
be available at some centers later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which manufactures china for such brands as Mikasa, Fitz & Floyd, 
Dansk, and Tiffany & Co., recently donated about 8,000 plates, cups and saucers 
to the Salvation Army for earthquake victims who need dishes. The china usually 
sells for $100 to $150 for a five-piece set. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may sound like extravagance in a time of need, but this is what we make, 
and this is what we can offer to people," said Brent Boyer, a spokesman for 
Golden State Porcelain. "We're just trying to pitch in." 
</P>
<P>
 The company didn't send the Salvation Army its finest stock, opting instead 
for a mish-mash of "cosmetic seconds," or items with slight blemishes, "blanks" 
or undecorated dishes, and discontinued patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to Boyer, "For someone not in the business, most of the defects 
would not be noticeable." He said the company throws away anything that is 
chipped. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Neil Timpson of the Salvation Army, who is handling the donation, moved 
the china into a lockup because he was afraid it would break in a Bell 
warehouse. He said the Salvation Army plans nothing out of the normal for the 
china. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're plates, and people need plates, we're not going to hold them 
because they're china," Timpson said. "We're going to do a check to see who 
needs dishware, and if a family needs dishware, they may receive this." 
</P>
<P>
 Timpson said the Salvation Army plans to sort through the different dishes and 
put them together into good-looking sets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I opened one box today and it was Mikasa. Very nice stuff," Timpson said. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be three to four weeks before the china is distributed, Timpson said, 
because the Salvation Army is still focused on emergency relief. He said he 
didn't know exactly what centers will be distributing the china. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salvation Army has received many requests for dishware, especially in the 
San Fernando Valley, said spokesman Russell Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 To help meet the demand, Corningware announced Thursday that it will donate a 
truckload of dishware to the Salvation Army Command Center in Van Nuys.

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; CSUN VENTURA BRACES FOR DISPLACED STUDENTS; 
EDUCATION: SATELLITE CAMPUS EXPECTS RECORD HIGH SPRING ENROLLMENT DUE TO 
EFFECTS OF EARTHQUAKE. 
</P>

 Spring enrollment at the Ventura campus of Cal State Northridge is expected to 
reach a record high as students displaced from earthquake-damaged classrooms at 
the college's main campus drive north for instruction, officials said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, about 1,500 people have inquired about courses in Ventura following 
the 6.6-magnitude Northridge earthquake that heavily damaged portions of Cal 
State Northridge. That is nearly three times the number of students who 
normally enroll at the tiny Ventura satellite campus for spring classes, said 
Joyce Kennedy, director of the Ventura site. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes begin Feb. 14, but students can register for Ventura courses until 
March 4. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30% of the callers said they are students who live in the San Fernando 
Valley who are considering commuting to Ventura to take classes that are 
temporarily unavailable in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 But most are Ventura County residents who normally commute to Northridge for 
classes. They said they may opt instead to receive instruction in Ventura, 
Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge's computerized registration system is still down, and 
college administrators do not know precisely how many will end up driving to 
Ventura. But administrators are planning for an influx of at least 200 new 
students, Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spring enrollment at the Ventura campus usually hovers at about 530, Kennedy 
said. "If what we predict comes true, our spring enrollment will the highest 
ever," Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators have already added two courses and reassigned faculty members 
to the Ventura campus' spring schedule in preparation for the reverse flow of 
students, Kennedy said. More courses may be added as the spring semester start 
date approaches, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A seven-story complex of faculty offices and classrooms at Cal State 
Northridge sustained heavy damage during the Jan. 17 earthquake, disrupting 
plans for spring classes scheduled to take place there. A newly built parking 
structure was destroyed and other buildings on campus have also suffered severe 
damage, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the quake has also taken a psychological toll of some students and their 
families, Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had parents call and say they are concerned about another earthquake," 
she said. "Or their daughter is very nervous about staying on the Northridge 
campus. And they want to know what we have available." 
</P>
<P>
 Students have called from as far away as Santa Clarita and Palmdale to find 
out if the Ventura satellite will enroll them, Kennedy said. Some are desperate 
to get a class, especially if they are nearing graduation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We say, 'You're welcome to come. But let me tell you where we are. We are out 
by the ocean, near the Oxnard Plain,' " Kennedy said. "And they say 'We don't 
care. We'll take the back roads.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Two business courses have been added to the Ventura site's spring schedule to 
handle the overflow, Kennedy said. Although classroom space and parking at the 
building on Allesandro Drive have always been tight, the campus will be able to 
handle more students because the added classes will be taught during the day.  
</P>
<P>
 Most Ventura campus classes are given at night, geared toward working adults 
pursuing upper-level classes to complete a degree. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy said the situation is expected to last only one semester, and that the 
Ventura campus won't see any budget windfall as a result of the higher 
enrollment. The students will continue to be registered at the main campus, 
with their fees going to the Northridge site, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like taking in relatives who are down on their luck," Kennedy said. 
"They won't be here forever, but we will do all we can to help them." 
</P>
<P>
 Quake damage to Cal State Northridge is not expected to delay plans for 
construction of a permanent Ventura County campus, said Colleen Bentley-Adler, 
a spokeswoman for the California State University system. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations to buy a 230-acre tract of land west of Camarillo are proceeding, 
and there is no indication that any money set aside for that purchase will be 
diverted to fix quake-ravaged buildings, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shouldn't have any impact, because the majority of funds to repair the 
buildings in Northridge will come from the federal government," Bentley-Adler 
said. "And the rest will be paid from the state's Office of Emergency 
Services." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Ventura campus, which suffered no damage from the earthquake, the 
biggest headache from the relocation of classes will be dealing with logistics, 
Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial aid has been delayed and academic record-keeping has been hampered 
by the loss of Cal State Northridge's computers, she said. Even figuring out 
how to get textbooks from Northridge to Ventura for the new classes poses a 
challenge, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Launie, a professor in the business department at Cal State Northridge, 
said the change of class sites will make him a "gypsy." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new schedule, he will continue to teach one class at Cal State 
Northridge, but is assigned to instruct another at the Ventura campus. Building 
inspectors have told him he may not be able to enter his office in Northridge, 
so he must carry his lesson plans, records and books in his car while shuttling 
from one campus to the other, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will have to carry my office in my car, essentially," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is one bonus: Launie lives in Camarillo, so his commute to the Ventura 
campus will be shorter. And after 28 years of teaching, Launie has a broader 
view of the process of education. 
</P>
<P>
 "A university isn't a physical plant or buildings or computers," Launie said. 
"Those things just aid us. I could sit out on the end of a log and have the 
students sit on the lawn and we could still function."

EARTHQUAKE: THE LONG ROAD BACK; FEDERAL ASSISTANCE IS A TOUCH AWAY; TECHNOLOGY: 
FEMA IS USING NEW HAND-HELD COMPUTERS IN RECORDING CLAIMS FOR QUAKE VICTIMS. 
OFFICIALS SAY THE SYSTEM WILL SAVE TIME AND MONEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 After trials by fire, flood and temblor, the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency has provided its Northridge earthquake inspectors with a new, portable 
computer system to help repair the shattered lives of disaster victims. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first very large-scale use of the Automated Construction Estimate 
system," said Scott Martin, chief of the FEMA Housing Disaster Branch. "My 
guess is it's going to shave at least five days to a week in the time the 
people get their checks and between $10 million and $20 million in 
administration costs." 
</P>
<P>
 The ACE system developed for the agency by UCS Inc. of Fort Lauderdale, Fla., 
consists of hand-held computer terminals on which inspectors can enter damage 
information while touring disaster sites. The information is then fed into a 
central computer bank in Redwood City, saving paper and man-hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The computers are manufactured by two companies, AST Research Inc. of Irvine, 
and Dauphin Technology Inc. of Lombard, Ill. 
</P>
<P>
 In some field tests, the ACE system slashed the time to process victims' 
applications for disaster aid in half. 
</P>
<P>
 The ACE system was tested in the Eureka earthquake and Phoenix floods, both in 
1992, and during last year's Southland firestorms. The results were positive 
enough that the computers were given to all 800 inspectors working on the 
Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, the 2.5-pound computer looks like a portable video game or an 
"Etch-a-Sketch" toy. But inspectors say it is all business, with software that 
contains inspection forms for FEMA aid applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The computers have cut down on a lot of garbage," said FEMA inspector Andres 
Villalon, 56, of Key Biscayne, Fla., who filled out paper forms during last 
year's Midwest floods. "The difference between working the Missouri floods and 
the Northridge quake is like night and day."  
</P>
<P>
 By touching a pen to a screen to fill out the inspection survey, inspectors 
say they are able to work faster and more accurately than they were with the 
old system of writing by hand on forms as they walked through damaged 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the paper forms, which provided for only 99-line items of damage, the 
software for the pen computers stores a list of more than 250-line items of 
loss resulting from tornado, hurricane, earthquake, fire and flood, Martin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspector simply touches the pen to one of the 11 damage categories on the 
screen (including electrical, floor and ceiling), then, the location of the 
damage (kitchen, bathroom, etc.) and finally the damaged item, which can range 
from common dishware to mobile home foundations. 
</P>
<P>
 The software calculates how much damage is done and the replacement costs in 
the area of the country the inspectors are working. And since a small keyboard 
types up reports, there is no confusion or delays resulting from poor 
handwriting. 
</P>
<P>
 "There seems to be something in the human gene pool that if you know how to 
repair a house, you can't spell," Martin said of his inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA's cost for each unit and its software is about $5,000. But Martin said 
the price will be worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The paper system shortchanged victims," Martin said. "During the field test 
in the Eureka, Calif., earthquake, inspectors' reports were 30% more accurate 
than with the paper system." 
</P>
<P>
 The new system will also benefit taxpayers, Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of each day, the ACE system allows inspectors to hook up a modem 
and send all their inspection data into a central processing facility in 
Redwood City. In prior disasters, they had to drive to a processing station to 
drop them off. 
</P>
<P>
 In an average disaster year with about 75,000 FEMA applicants, Martin 
estimates that the ACE system will save about $5.4 million in administrative 
costs. The Northridge earthquake, by comparison, could result in four times as 
many applicants and four times the savings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Typically, an inspector will lose a couple of days of work just driving back 
and forth," Martin said. "What we've done is turn inspectors into data-entry 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 This is a welcome relief for FEMA inspector Don Walters of Eureka, Mo., who 
drove daily from the flood-ravaged areas of Missouri to the central processing 
headquarters in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would drive seven hours, do between eight and 11 appointments, and drive 
back," he said. "Here, I can go from Northridge to Sylmar to Lake View Terrace 
and send everything in at night."

DRIVER KILLS MAN, INJURES SECOND CHANGING FLAT TIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 21-year-old Santa Ana man was killed Saturday and a second man injured when 
they were hit by a car as they changed a flat tire in a non-traffic transition 
area at the interchange of the Costa Mesa and Riverside freeways, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The men apparently were working on the left front tire of their pickup truck 
when they were struck by a car driven by Lisa Freeman, 26, of Fullerton, a 
California Highway Patrol spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman apparently tried to cut across the gore point, the painted area 
marking the beginning of the transition from the northbound Costa Mesa Freeway 
to the westbound Riverside Freeway, and did not notice the parked truck, CHP 
Officer Angel Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, who was taken to Kaiser Permanente Hospital-Orange County in 
Anaheim where he later died, was lying partly under the pickup at the time of 
the accident, she said. His name was not released pending notification of 
relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 His passenger, Kevin Giordano, 21, of Costa Mesa, suffered moderate injuries 
after the force of the accident sent him flying about 30 feet through the air, 
Johnson said. Giordano and Freeman, who suffered minor injuries, were treated 
at Placentia Linda Community Hospital in Placentia and released, Johnson said.

GARDEN GROVE CITY COUNCIL RETAINS SPECIAL WATER FEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT BARKER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Councilman Robert F. Dinsen was rebuffed by his colleagues Tuesday night 
when he called for repeal of a water fee, which would decrease the average 
residential bill by 11% beginning July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguing for the elimination of the water fee, which brings in $1.38 million in 
revenue, Dinsen said that residents living on Social Security "of a few hundred 
dollars a month" can't afford the extra 11% charge on their bimonthly water 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
 However, other council members balked, contending that if they eliminated the 
fee, they would have to cut essential public services. Any cuts would have to 
come out of police, fire and zoning functions, Mayor Frank Kessler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinsen complained Wednesday that federal and state governments "are digging in 
the taxpayers' pockets and the city doesn't want to be left out." The City 
Council approved the water fee in 1991. It provides revenue for the general 
fund to offset revenue losses in other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the fee covers partial costs that the city spent for the 
formation of the Water Department and for street work incurred for maintenance 
of water lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Water bills for the typical Garden Grove household are the fourth-lowest in 
Orange County cities, according to a recent survey, officials said.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Lancaster man has been arrested on suspicion of killing a clothing store 
manager whose body was found last Monday in his Palmdale home, sheriff's 
deputies said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Beltran, 22, was being held without bail at the Antelope Valley 
Sheriff's Station following his arrest Friday afternoon in the shooting death 
of Steven Lee Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 The slain man's body was discovered by a co-worker Monday night after he 
failed to show up for work, Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy Irma Becerra 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beltran, described by Becerra as "a recent acquaintance" of the 38-year-old 
Stewart, was arrested at his Lancaster home, where Becerra said officers found 
property belonging to Stewart and a gun believed to be the weapon involved.

MAN IN CRITICAL CONDITION AFTER SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 21-year-old Palmdale man remained in critical condition Saturday night with 
a gunshot wound to the head, and authorities said a second man was arrested on 
suspicion of attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Mickey Elliott was in critical condition at Antelope Valley Hospital Medical 
Center in Lancaster, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliott was transferred to the Lancaster facility from Palmdale General 
Hospital, where he was taken by ambulance following the shooting Friday 
afternoon in the 38100 block of 11th Street East in Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthew Nall, 39, also of Palmdale, was arrested at the scene and was booked

 John and Larry Gassman have never seen a picture of Superman. They can't. Born 
more than two months premature, their optic nerves never matured enough to 
allow them to ever see anything. 
</P>
<P>
 So they listen instead. Since childhood, the 39-year-old identical twins have 
been hooked on radio dramas, listening to shows that allow them to use their 
imaginations to follow the red-caped Man of Steel as he leaped tall buildings 
in a single bound. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of our earliest memories is hearing a radio drama when we were 5 or 6," 
said John, who along with his brother has developed a zealous determination to 
never let the recordings of old-time radio dramas such as "Superman," 
"Gunsmoke" and "The Green Hornet" vanish from the airwaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Their collection of nearly 20,000 reel-to-reel tapes of vintage shows lines 
the walls and spreads onto the floor of the family room-turned-studio, from 
which the Gassmans produce a weekly show of classic radio drama for KPCC-FM 
(89.3) in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 John walks slowly among the stacks of tapes on the floor, some recently 
deposited on the carpet of their Whittier home by the Northridge earthquake. He 
puts on headphones as he nears a table covered in reel-to-reel tape machines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh great, now I can't hear where I'm going," he mumbles, reaching his hands 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, it's never stopped you before," said Larry, who is already seated in 
front of his microphone. Their fingers dance deftly across the dials of their 
tape recorders and then the two launch into the introduction to their show, 
"Same Time, Same Channel" (heard Sundays from 5 to 7 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
 "Got a lot of variety on the show this week," John says. He adds that the 
herniated disc that was pinching the nerves in Larry's neck has been removed. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we've found you can't play the disc (on a turntable) with acupuncture 
needles after all," John says. "So stop calling." 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got a lot of nerve mentioning that," Larry quips. 
</P>
<P>
 The show is timed using a talking clock that quietly rattles off 10-second 
increments in a canned digital voice out of range of the microphones, and their 
talking watches have a crowing-rooster alarm to stop them from running over. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers still make their tapes on reel-to-reel recorders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's harder to use the new tape recorders," Larry says. "We've always had to 
do everything by feel and sound, and the new buttons don't make any noise." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of their collection is taped from records donated by radio drama stars, 
such as the late Vincent Price, John says. He also serves as acquisitions chair 
for the Society to Preserve and Encourage Radio Drama, Variety and Comedy, a 
Los Angeles club of old-time radio enthusiasts formed in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 The 16-inch discs captured about 15 minutes of performance on each side of an 
aluminum-based record. During World War II, such records were made on glass to 
save the metal for the war effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put ads in the papers when we started collecting, and word spread from 
word-of-mouth that we wanted the recordings," John says. "People are usually 
glad to give (the records) to us because we have the turntables to play them 
and the equipment to preserve the discs," which are very fragile. 
</P>
<P>
 KPCC is a public radio station broadcasting from Pasadena City College, so the 
brothers do their show for free. They get by on Social Security and a little 
money they make from singing with a local barbershop quartet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gassmans started playing records at Rio Hondo College in the early 1970s. 
After earning degrees in communications from Cal Poly Pomona, they got their 
chance to fill the radio drama slot at KPCC in 1980 after an announcer moved to 
Arizona. They've been spinning stacks of old records ever since.

<P>
 A summary of selected City Hall actions this past week affecting Central Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * PERSHING SQUARE: Approved a proposal to install 60 street banners and 
provide traffic control officers for today's ceremony reopening Pershing 
Square, at a cost of $4,500 to the city. A crowd of 5,000 is expected. 
</P>
<P>
 * EARTHQUAKE SAFETY: Approved an ordinance that would require new concrete and 
masonry chimneys to be anchored to the structural framework of buildings. Also, 
masonry and concrete block walls under 3 1/2 feet, previously exempt from the 
building code regulations, would now have to comply with the code. The changes 
follow widespread damage caused by falling chimneys and walls in the Jan. 17 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOTEL RENOVATION: Approved using $388,000 in Community Development Block 
Grant funds to upgrade two single-room-occupancy hotels in the Central City 
East area. The hotels are the Russ Hotel at 521 S. San Julian St. and the 
Eugene Hotel at 560 S. Stanford Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 * FINGERPRINTING: Approved the transfer of $251,800 in the police officers' 
salary fund to be used to purchase the Live Scan Fingerprinting Network, which 
will enable the Police Department to obtain higher-quality fingerprints in a 
more timely manner. The Live Scan system will scan fingerprints electronically, 
replacing the current rolled-ink method. 
</P>
<P>
 * CONTRACT POLICY: Approved a local preference policy for awarding contracts 
related to earthquake recovery efforts. Such preferences will go to contractors 
located in earthquake-damaged areas or to firms that employ residents of those 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 * BRIGHTON AVENUE: Decided against changing the name of Brighton Avenue 
between Adams Boulevard and Jefferson Boulevard to Stennis Avenue because of 
the objections of an overwhelming majority of residents of that neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 * STREET CLOSURE: Approved the closure of Kohler Street, between 7th and 8th 
streets, from 11 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. Friday for a free performance by violinist 
Itzhak Perlman for 300 inner-city elementary school students. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 How South-Central and Eastside City Council representatives voted on selected 
issues. * UTILITY FEES: Approved a Department of Water and Power plan that 
would waive all electric and water turn-on fees for residential customers and 
small businesses who suffered damages from the earthquake. Passed 10-0. Voting 
yes: Mike Hernandez, Rita Walters, Nate Holden, Jackie Goldberg. Absent: 
Richard Alatorre, Mark Ridley-Thomas, Rudy Svorinich Jr. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

CAMPUS & CAREER GUIDE; Q & A; COMMUNITY COLLEGES CHIEF FACES CHALLENGES; 
LEADERSHIP: DAVID MERTES, CHANCELLOR OF THE 107-SCHOOL SYSTEM, SAYS BUDGET CUTS 
HAVE CHANGED THE WAY THEY RESPOND TO STUDENTS' NEEDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For almost six years, David Mertes has been chancellor of the California 
Community Colleges system, helping to guide the sometimes fractious collection 
of 107 two-year colleges that are controlled by locally elected boards but 
depend on Sacramento for financing. 
</P>
<P>
 A respected career administrator with a Berkeley Ph.D. in zoology, Mertes, 63, 
headed the innovative Los Rios Community College District in Sacramento before 
taking the reins of the state system in July, 1988. Recently, he talked to 
Times education writer Jean Merl about challenges facing the colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: The community colleges have always prided themselves on being accessible to 
everyone. Have the continuing state budget problems changed that significantly? 
</P>
<P>
 A: State law requires that we accept every student 18 or older who can benefit 
from the instruction. When we do not have sufficient budgets, as has been the 
case in the past three years, we are not able to offer enough classes for 
students who have been admitted. Consequently, some of them do not find the 
classes they need, and they leave. We have been unable to fulfill one of our 
primary missions, which is to be a point of entry into higher education for all 
who can benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Who stands to lose the most when classes are reduced? 
</P>
<P>
 A. The losers are the people who are the poorest members of our society, 
people who often do not have the flexibility to make adjustments. Take a 
middle-aged woman who is a single parent, is struggling with a minimally paying 
job. She has the problems of child care, transportation . . . yet she wants to 
become more productive, wants a better-paying job. If she can't get into one of 
our classes, she probably has no alternatives. She just doesn't have the range 
of options that some others might have. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Couldn't colleges find ways to accommodate such students?  
</P>
<P>
 A. Most colleges already are trying to find ways to utilize the facilities 
better and meet students' needs. Many colleges have as large a number of 
students attending in the evening as in the day. They operate from early 
morning until 10 or 11 at night. Many have programs on Saturdays. Colleges are 
much more focused on what their mission is. I see a lot of them imposing a much 
stronger sense of accountability on themselves. Many are working much more 
closely with business to be sure we are providing what is needed; all are 
trying ways to provide more instruction at less cost. We're doing it, but we 
have to keep trying to find ways to do it even more effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What are some of the other effects of the ongoing state budget troubles? 
</P>
<P>
 A. This academic year, our enrollments are down about 9%, due to a couple of 
factors. First, there has been a sharp increase in fees. A year ago this past 
September, the cost was $6 per unit. Now, it's $13 a unit, and $50 a unit if 
you have a bachelor's degree. Second, we've had budgets that have been 
essentially flat at a time when there have been increasing numbers of people 
wanting to get into the community colleges. Statewide, we have had to cut the 
curriculum by 10% over a three-year period. That represents 13,000 class 
sections. That's a lot of lost instruction. Salaries also are flat. I would say 
the colleges have attempted to use their money for classes instead of raising 
salaries, buying supplies, maintaining buildings, and we'll pay a price for 
that, too, down the line. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. In this time of shrinking resources, should priority be given to some 
students over others? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Yes, and we have been doing that. The board of governors, on my 
recommendation, adopted a policy about a year and half ago that provides 
guidelines to colleges. Those guidelines give preference to students working 
toward a defined goal. They get first choice in signing up for classes; 
newcomers with a defined goal get next choice. There is a whole series of 
priorities, and the last goes to people with BA degrees who are coming for 
recreational or avocational interests. If a seat is available, they certainly 
are welcome, but they don't get at the front of the line and take the seat away 
from somebody going through for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How do you determine if someone is a worthy student or is making adequate 
progress? 
</P>
<P>
 A. There is a formal process involving a series of assessments. It begins when 
a student first comes in; we determine what level of class he or she will be 
successful in. . . . Then a student's progress is monitored, and counseling is 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Proponents of raising fees, including the governor, have pointed out that 
the community colleges are still a tremendous bargain. Fees are still lower 
than at most of the other two-year colleges in the nation, and a great deal 
less than those at Cal State and UC. 
</P>
<P>
 A. Yes, it is a bargain. But look at this from a different point of view. 
Given the diversity of this state, the large numbers of immigrants, the large 
numbers of people needing to learn new job skills to prepare for a new economy, 
there has to be a system that people can turn to to become productive members 
of society. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I agree with the governor that jobs are the key to California's future. I 
would simply add that good jobs require well-prepared people. I see the lowest 
possible fees as an investment in California's future.

CAMPUS & CAREER GUIDE; ADVANCED DEGREES EARNED OFF CAMPUS AND ON-LINE; HOME 
STUDY: LECTURES, CLASS DISCUSSIONS, PAPERS AND EXAMS ARE DONE VIA COMPUTER. 
BUSY STUDENTS SET THEIR OWN SCHEDULES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Dr. Iver Juster's idea of a good time is getting a master's in business 
administration. Business fascinates him, and the degree couldn't hurt in his 
career as a physician-executive. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was never time. Juster has a family and works 60 hours a week as 
medical director for a Cerritos health maintenance organization. In spare 
moments, he is an insatiable consumer of workshops and home study courses. 
</P>
<P>
 Then last year, Juster heard about an MBA program offered entirely by 
computer. All the lectures, class discussions, papers and exams took place 
on-line. Students came and went on their own schedules, signing on before work 
or after midnight. If they kept up, participated in class, did their papers and 
passed the tests, they could have an MBA within 2 1/2 years. It was perfect for 
Juster. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the HMO director signs on to the University of Phoenix's on-line MBA 
program -- usually before dawn, armed with a cup of coffee, at his home 
computer in Long Beach. But he has also logged on from a dance camp in Sequoia 
National Park over the Labor Day weekend. And from time to time he lugs his 
laptop to a Thai restaurant near his office and squeezes in some on-line time 
over lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 He spends 15 to 20 hours a week on schoolwork. By late next year, if all goes 
well, Iver Juster MD will become Iver Juster MD, MBA. 
</P>
<P>
 Juster is one of a growing number of busy adults -- higher education's "new 
majority," known in the old days as non-traditional students -- whom schools 
have begun courting with a high-tech bag of tricks capable of offering courses, 
degree programs, even an entire college education, to people who need never set 
foot on a campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The New Jersey Institute of Technology in Newark, for example, offers a 
bachelor of arts in information systems via videotapes and a system of computer 
conferences it calls the virtual classroom. In the near future, Cal Poly San 
Luis Obispo plans to offer videotaped lectures and demonstrations combined with 
self-paced tutorials, electronic mail and conferencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other California state universities plan to offer college courses to 
students in rural high schools, relying entirely on videotapes, printed 
materials sent by mail, and computer and telephone conferencing. Northern 
Virginia Community College offers foreign language teaching by voice mail, 
enabling a teacher miles away to correct a student's accent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have multiple senses, right?" said Sally M. Johnstone, director of the 
Western Cooperative for Educational Telecommunications in Boulder, Colo. "So we 
might have some video, some computing, some audio conferencing, some faxing 
back and forth of quick written material. There's now a whole basket of 
technological tools that can be used." 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,000 students are enrolled in the University of Phoenix on-line degree 
programs. About 1,500 students have taken on-line courses through Connected 
Education Inc. in White Plains, N.Y., since 1985. And thousands of others have 
taken classes and earned degrees through other forms of long-distance learning. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices vary. A single three-credit course through Connected Education costs 
$1,344. Juster's MBA will end up costing $16,000 to $17,000, he figures. In 
most cases, the telephone calls necessary to link up with an on-line service 
are local or toll-free. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the appeal of distance learning is obvious: In most cases, no one has 
to be any place at any time. An engineer, say, who hopes to keep abreast in a 
rapidly evolving field and be positioned for a lucrative promotion can take 
long business trips and even be transferred cross-country without ever missing 
a class or exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Galloway, 40, of Springfield, Va., designs training programs for 
companies. He works for a consulting group but wants to eventually go out on 
his own. So he recently got a master of science degree in instructional and 
performance technology from Boise State University via computer rather than 
attend the University of Maryland, 90 minutes away. 
</P>
<P>
 Margie Whiteleather, 28, of Ashland, Ohio, found other advantages. She has an 
undergraduate degree from Yale College. Now she is working her way, on-line, 
toward a master's degree in media studies from the New School for Social 
Research in New York City through Connected Education. Naturally shy and 
reticent in "in-person" classes, Whiteleather says she participates far more 
on-line. 
</P>
<P>
 Students with impaired hearing for whom English is a second language also 
thrive on-line. In addition, prejudices are undermined. "I don't know if these 
people are white, black, yellow, fat, thin, tall, overweight or have a speech 
impediment," said Mark Eisley, who runs the Boise State program. "Things that 
might cause a bias or a hesitation to participate aren't there." 
</P>
<P>
 For college administrators, too, distance courses are suddenly hot. Faced with 
dwindling resources, rising demand and shifting student demographics, schools 
in states such as California are finding it makes sense to try educating people 
at home or at work rather than squandering scarce money on new buildings that 
future students will be too busy to reach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many universities are starting to see that this could be a path out of the 
problems they are facing, in terms of more students than they could possibly 
educate in their current buildings or with their current faculty," said Lin 
Foa, deputy director of the Annenberg/CPB Projects in Washington, which 
supports the development of courses and course materials to improve the quality 
of and access to education. 
</P>
<P>
 But how good is this form of education? Students seem pleased, although they 
say some teachers use the technology more effectively than others. Some 
students feared that their courses would be too easy but have been pleasantly 
surprised. It's easy to fall behind, they say; motivation and self-discipline 
help. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, few programs have been systematically evaluated. "Not enough 
effort has been put into assessment, frankly," said Jay Donahue, a senior 
program officer at the Fund for the Improvement of Post-Secondary Education at 
the U.S. Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 The evaluations that have been performed are encouraging, researchers say. In 
New Jersey, researchers offered identical undergraduate and graduate courses 
on-line and in person over three years. When they compared each group's exams 
and grades, the only significant differences had occurred in the computer 
science courses. The on-line students had done better. 
</P>
<P>
 Starr Roxanne Hiltz, a pioneer in the use of computer conferencing in 
education who conducted the experiment at New Jersey Institute of Technology in 
Newark and Uppsala College in East Orange, believes the main advantage of 
on-line classes is that they encourage collaborative, or group, learning. 
Students work more closely with one another, and the role of the professor 
shifts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a change in the role of the lecturer, who stood up there expounding 
truth with a capital T, to a kind of learning facilitator and coordinator who 
pulls together a set of resources, issues and questions," she said. It is much 
more possible to give group assignments and require teamwork because the 
technology negates the usual barriers to getting together. 
</P>
<P>
 Remarkably, some evaluations have found that students and faculty prefer 
distance education because there is more student-faculty interaction, 
particularly when computer conferencing is used. "My on-line students are more 
personal with me than my traditional students," Hiltz said.  
</P>
<P>
 Some professors, however, have other concerns. Sondra Farganis teaches social 
theory at the New School for Social Research and is about to teach her first 
on-line class. The prospect thrills and fascinates her. But she wonders if she 
will still be able to convey her passion for her subject. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would worry about it turning into a kind of chatty talk show," said Robert 
Polito, a writer and poet who is also embarking upon teaching his first on-line 
course at the New School. "In a classroom discussion, a teacher provides a lot 
of focusing and redirection." 
</P>
<P>
 There are legal, ethical and logistic questions, as well. Should faculty be 
evaluated differently than in the past if they are teaching on-line? What about 
copyrights? And if a professor agrees to videotape a course for later use, can 
the university continue to use the videotape long after the teacher has left 
for another job? 
</P>
<P>
 But while those issues are sorted out, Juster moves methodically toward 
graduation. "A day doesn't go by that I don't apply something that I've 
learned," he said. Where to Learn On-Line 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of the educational institutions offering courses and degree 
programs via computer: 
</P>
<P>
 * Boise State University, 1910 University Drive, Boise, Ida. 83725. (800) 
824-7017, Ext. 4079. Master of science in instructional and performance 
technology.

<P>
 * Connected Education Inc., 65 Shirley Lane, White Plains, N.Y. 10607. (914) 
428-8766. Master of arts in media studies with a specialization in technology 
and society. Offered jointly with the New School for Social Research. 
</P>
<P>
 * New Jersey Institute of Technology, University Heights, Newark, N.J. 07102. 
(201) 596-3366. Bachelor of arts in information systems. 
</P>
<P>

94105. (800) 742-4742. Master of business administration, master of arts in 
organizational management, bachelor of science in business administration and 
bachelor of arts in management. Some Intelligent Talk -- Without Saying a Word 
</P>
<P>
 During an on-line course last year called Artificial Intelligence and Real 
Life, offered by Connected Education Inc. of White Plains, N.Y., and the New 
School for Social Research in New York City, Prof. Paul Levinson asked his 
students to discuss computer theory pioneer Alan Turing's famous test of 
artificial intelligence: If we can't tell the difference between the way a 
machine behaves (or "talks" or "writes" to us) and the way a human does, then 
by what criteria do we deny the machine human intelligence? 
</P>
<P>
 The on-line discussion that ensued lasted for weeks, leaping from the subject 
of the soul to Star Trek and beyond. Here is a sampling of the E-mail 
exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 2/2/93, 6:45 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
 * Student 1: I remember reading some of the text of . . . computer-human 
exchanges and thinking it fairly inane. But then I listened to a couple of 
teen-agers recently and perhaps it was not so far off. 
</P>
<P>
 2/6/93, 7:31 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 * Student 2: "Smart" machines are indeed fantastic -- within limits, machines 
have some of the capabilities of human intelligence. But, does the machine have 
the ability to reason? . . . So what does a machine have to do to pass my 
Turing test? Show that it's alive? It's not. 
</P>
<P>
 2/7/93, 11:07 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
 * Student 3: It may be true that we have the ability to distinguish reality 
from illusion, but we also have the ability to choose not to. My neighbor 
believes that her dead dog visits her nightly . . . I do not, however, choose 
to perceive an intelligent piece of plastic and circuitry to be a living being. 
</P>
<P>
 2/7/93, 5:38 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 * Student 4: At first I thought this course (no offense) was going to muddel 
around in speculation and low-level, widely known facts (at least to me) but it 
seems you really are quite competent (giggle-ha-ha). 
</P>
<P>
 2/8/93, 11:08 a.m.  
</P>
<P>
 * Levinson: I was hoping someone would seriously introduce the notion of soul 
here. How about taking a shot at defining it for us -- and in what way it is 
different from other qualities like intelligence, emotion, personality, etc.? 
</P>
<P>
 2/9/93, 11:13 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 * Student 5: Tell me more about this dead dog thing. Might make a good pet for 
those of us who are allergic to almost all living things! 
</P>
<P>
 2/11/93, 8:35 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 * Student 6: To continue with the debate on souls, . . . if the soul has 
something to do with "essential being" and "what makes us tick," is our 
essential being something we all have in common or what makes each individual 
unique? I'd opt for the latter in my definition of soul . . . People in beer 
commercials and other lifestyle ads are good representatives of soulless 
beings.

 * Student 6: Hey, (Student 2), I just reread all my questions to you about the 
divine and what not, and realized that in my editing frenzy in the wee hours I 
might have come across like a lawyer cross-examining a witness. 
</P>
<P>
 2/14/93, 9:31 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 * Student 5: So, back to the question of what is a soul . . . I'm not sure a 
soul qualifies as matter but I'm still having a hard time grasping anything 
that's not solid, liquid or gas. 
</P>
<P>
 2/15/93, 2:23 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 * Student 3: (Student 6), I just read your new note -- don't worry about all 
of the questions -- they make all of this much more interesting. Besides, 
challenges are good for the soul .

CAMPUS & CAREER GUIDE; STUDY FINDS THAT STUDENTS VIEW COLLEGE AS MEANS TO AN 
END 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 You consider yourself to be fairly bright. You're in college, mostly because 
you want to make good money. (Yes, it is ironic that you are piling up the 
student loans like never before.) And the competition is so keen in the job 
market, you plan to get a graduate degree -- especially if you are a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 In these times, however, that business degree is losing some of its '80s go-go 
luster. But President Clinton is talking national health care, so you're more 
interested than ever in medicine or a related health career. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, you're stressed. Really stressed. Maybe that's why you 
procrastinate on your homework and show up late for class. And maybe that's 
because you're recuperating from the six hours or more of socializing you do 
each week. 
</P>
<P>
 If the above description fits, congratulations: You are the typical 1993-94 
college freshman, according to the Higher Education Research Institute at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are just some of the connect-the-dots factoids that the educational 
think tank, in conjunction with the American Council on Education, found in its 
comprehensive survey of aspirations, activities and attitudes among 221,000 
full-time students who entered 427 colleges last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander W. Astin, survey director and UCLA professor of higher education, 
said the picture that emerges from this year's survey is a "nice package . . . 
of stress-related, competitive-oriented findings." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the responses show that today's freshmen are "seeing college more in 
pragmatic terms rather than in intrinsic terms, or even (as a way to) have fun 
and learn about themselves or the world. It's more a means to an end." 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA survey, the most recent in a 28-year study, found that for a record 
number of freshmen, degrees will be like a Jacqueline Susann novel -- one is 
not enough. Sixty-five percent fully intend to get their bachelor's on the way 
to a master's, doctorate, law or medical degree. That figure represents a sharp 
increase from the 55% just the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the first time, the survey found that the majority of those who plan 
to seek doctoral degrees are women, not men. This is a dramatic turnaround from 
the late 1960s, when many men declared their intention to venture further into 
the labyrinth of academe, but only 8.5% of women did. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the interest in doing so? 
</P>
<P>
 As The Man said: It's the economy, stupid. 
</P>
<P>
 And don't today's freshmen know it. When asked the most important reason for 
getting a higher education, the most frequent answer was "get a better job" 
(82.1%), with "to make more money" and "learn more about things" in a virtual 
dead heat for second place. Asked about their objectives, more freshmen said 
they wanted to be "well-off financially" (74.5%) than "raise a family" (70.6%) 
or "help others in difficulty" (60.5%). 
</P>
<P>
 The survey also showed that more freshmen were picking their schools based on 
low tuition and the availability of financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
 "These findings suggest that the students may be more interested in graduate 
degrees because they think the advanced training will give them a competitive 
edge in their quest for jobs and financial security," said Astin. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the pressure of competition manifested itself throughout the survey 
results. The UCLA study found that record numbers of freshmen: 
</P>
<P>
 * Tried to increase their chances of getting into college by applying to more 
than one institution (70.3%) 
</P>
<P>
 * Were mailing off their high school transcripts to four or more universities 
(22.2%). 
</P>
<P>
 * Felt "overwhelmed by all I have to do" (23.2%). 
</P>
<P>
 * Missed class because they were sick (4.7%). 
</P>
<P>
 * Were working full-time while going to school (5.6%). 
</P>
<P>
 Academically, fewer freshmen were pursuing business degrees (16.1%), marking a 
steady six-year decline, while interest in the allied health fields climbed 
during the same period to a new high (15.8%). 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever their studies, freshmen had big academic hopes. Most expected to pull 
a B average or to be named to an honor society, and the lowest number ever said 
they expected to "fail one or more courses." And why not? They came to campus 
with the best high school grades of any entering class in nearly three decades 
-- 27% listed an A-minus average or better. 
</P>
<P>
 Astin said those marks, part of the much-condemned grade inflation in the 
educational ranks, are just another manifestation of competition. The 
expectations of parents and students are putting pressure on teachers to be 
easier with grades and improve the chances of getting into college, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet once they land on campus, more students than ever are admitting they have 
large holes in their academic robes. Nearly 12% said they needed tutoring in 
science and nearly 29% said they needed remedial work in math. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the survey showed some fairly sloppy study habits as well. Freshmen 
said they were studying far less than their older brothers and sisters did; 
only 33.7% hit the books six hours a week or more, compared to 43.7% in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 And in an admission that would surely steal the magna off anyone's cum laude , 
a third said they had been bored in class (slightly more than in 1990), 
two-thirds said they didn't complete their homework on time (slightly less than 
in the 1970s) and more than 50% said they had shown up late for class (no 
change). All this bears out an impending disappointment with higher education, 
as fewer students than ever said they expected to be satisfied with their 
college experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Politically, this freshman class is more willing to stake out positions on 
both ends of the spectrum. For the first time since 1972, less than half said 
they were "middle of the road" (49.9%). 
</P>
<P>
 Even with their more sharply divergent political views, the freshmen reflected 
a consensus of social preferences, the study noted. Although the numbers 
weren't as high as in former years, overwhelming majorities of freshmen still 
want the government to crack down on polluters, promote energy conservation and 
protect consumers' interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Support for gun control is at its highest (81.8%), as well as support for 
legalizing marijuana (28.2%) and willingness to reduce the federal deficit by 
raising taxes (31.4%). Seventy-two percent said the wealthy should pay more 
taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although nearly 39% said they had participated in demonstrations, an activity 
protected by the 1st Amendment, 62.7% preferred prohibitions against racist or 
sexist speech, a movement that is counter to the 1st Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 When it came to matters of the heart or other physical regions, 44.8% said it 
was OK for people to have sex if they merely liked each other. Twenty percent 
said they had discussed "safe sex" and 62.4% agreed that abortion should be 
legal. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 68% said they performed volunteer work. More than 54% were beer 
drinkers but only 11.6% said they smoked cigarettes.

CAMPUS & CAREER GUIDE; DORMS WITH A DIFFERENCE; CAMPUS HOUSING OFFERS THE 
COMFORTS OF HOME

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Mi Kyung Kim was trying to decide which university to attend three years 
ago, she had more on her mind than the quality of academic programs, the size 
of the lecture halls or the number of National Merit scholars walking through 
the quad. 
</P>
<P>
 She wanted a campus with a touch of domesticity, where she would have more 
than a roof over her head at the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, where you live may not seem so pertinent because basically you're 
going to college for an education," said Kim, now a UCLA junior majoring in 
anthropology. "But after a whole day of class, I like to go back to a place 
that I can call home." 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time when students like Kim could not expect such creature 
comforts. They were either packed into sterile, functional campus dormitories 
or, fed up with the crowding and lack of privacy, decided to run the gantlet of 
cheap, Zhivagoesque apartments and rental houses in the predatory off-campus 
housing market. The best hope: that the rent was low and the plumbing worked. 
</P>
<P>
 But today, students are demanding more than just "Gimme Shelter." Mindful of 
their market, campus housing officials are scrambling to respond.  
</P>
<P>
 Thus, Kim and 1,366 other UCLA students can choose to live in Sunset Village, 
the school's newest residential complex that resembles an upscale suburban 
enclave, not the barracks-like functional architecture of years past. With an 
apartment-like layout that guarantees added privacy, Kim likes the 2-year-old 
complex so much that she has lived in the same room since her freshman year.  
</P>
<P>
 More and more, colleges are building complexes like Sunset Village as a way to 
lure and keep students anchored to campuses. These newer developments sometimes 
offer a holistic touch, with live-in professors, theme housing, nearby shops 
and conveniences that students once only dreamed about. 
</P>
<P>
 In UCLA's case, it was competition with Westwood landlords that prompted 
student housing officials to pay closer attention to the domestic needs of the 
5,627 undergraduates living on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, college officials had nothing to worry about. With housing in 
Westwood tight and rents high, thousands of students signed waiting lists just 
to find a place on campus, said Jack Gibbons, associate director of UCLA's 
Office of Residential Life. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture changed drastically when a building boom in Westwood and the 
recession led to a surplus of apartments. Landlords cut rents, triggering an 
exodus of students from the old-fashioned dormitories into cheaper Westwood 
apartments. The waiting lists dwindled and UCLA housing officials faced vacant 
dorm rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students found acceptable alternatives elsewhere as local, private landlords 
offered incentives, such as 'Come live with us and you'll get a free trip to 
Hawaii' or 'We'll pay your fall (registration) fees for you,' " Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, in order to retain residents from one year to the next, and attract new 
students, we have done some things to market our desirability in housing 
programs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those changes include the construction of Sunset Village. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The $90-million complex has three buildings, with modern architecture and 
landscaping crossed with sidewalks and dotted with magnolia trees. Unlike 
traditional dorms, rooms resemble apartments, affording privacy with individual 
bathrooms, air conditioning and heaters. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first moved in, I just loved it," Kim said. "I felt like I was moving 
into a mini-apartment. And I was glad because I didn't want to feel like I was 
living in an anonymous cubicle." 
</P>
<P>
 Other students said the private bathrooms -- rather than the communal 
facilities used in dorms -- were also key in attracting students to Sunset 
Village. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really cool here. We have our own bathroom and it's really important to 
us girls," said third-year business and economics major Frances Ng. 
</P>
<P>
 Because there is so much counter space, Ng added, she sometimes studies in the 
bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-year student Bobby Lee said private bathrooms were essential for another 
reason. As a freshman living in one of UCLA's high-rise dorms, Lee said he and 
his roommate once made the embarrassing mistake of walking into the girls' 
bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told my mother if I was going to live in the dorms at all, then I wanted to 
live in Sunset Village because I needed a quieter, bigger space with its own 
bathroom," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nestled in the middle of Sunset Village's residential space is another popular 
amenity -- a commons building, where students can mingle with resident 
professors, talk to counselors, get tutoring or do their homework in a computer 
lab. First-year students can also take freshman seminars in the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the way there is Puzzles, an arcade and after-hours fast-food 
restaurant, as well as Hilltop, a mini-student union where students can buy 
anything ranging from school supplies to compact discs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The result is that we've more fully integrated the students' academic 
experience with their residential experience," Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes appear to be succeeding, he added. During the beginning of the 
academic year, more students were seeking UCLA housing than expected and, for a 
short time, several students lived in lounges that had been converted into 
makeshift rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Some were relocated to a wing of Dykstra Hall's basement, which officials had 
been thinking about shutting down. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it can cost as much as $1,810 more a year to live in Sunset compared 
to the typical high-rise dorm, students do not seem to mind, Gibbons said. 
"Sunset Village is very popular with both new and returning students. It seems 
that they want to pay the price." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's the snob appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people call us spoiled because it costs more, but I think it's worth 
it," said Ng. "In comparison to the other dorms, I feel like I'm living 
high-class." 
</P>
<P>
 Other universities have changed their approach to student housing as well. The 
University of Southern California, which has the second-largest student housing 
program in the state, is experimenting with a residential college complex 
modeled after Oxford's and Harvard's. Professors live with students at the 
complex and participate more in their daily lives, said Ken Taylor, USC's 
director of residential and Greek life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a chance for students to get to know faculty as complete human beings 
and not just as an unapproachable someone standing in front of a classroom," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice as many faculty apply to live in the complex than there are slots 
available, enticed by the rent-free housing.  
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, enrollment growth at UC Irvine created a bigger demand for 
on-campus living. Instead of building traditional dormitories, UCI constructed 
35 theme houses, which opened in September. The residences bring together 
students with common interests -- such as engineering, fine arts or Greek 
letter organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford University, which has the largest student housing program in the 
state, finds accommodations for 93% of its undergraduates, or 5,900 students, 
and has used theme houses for several years. "Students organize their lives 
around the individual residences and have a strong house identity," said 
William Georges, Stanford's director of housing. 
</P>
<P>
 But the changes in on-campus housing have not been successful in coaxing all 
students back to campus. David White, a UCLA junior majoring in psychology, 
said he moved off campus to find something cheaper and less restrictive. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of rules and regulations in the dorms that limit your 
freedom," said White, referring to UCLA bans on alcohol consumption, except 
behind dorm room doors, and mandatory quiet hours every evening. "Those 
restrictions don't apply in the real world. They're unrealistic." 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who said they have enjoyed living in the residence halls plan to 
move off campus before graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim said she will probably move into non-UCLA housing around Westwood next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the same time that I enjoy living here, I feel coddled," she said. "I 
think I'm mature enough to handle living on my own and I have to find out 
sooner or later anyway." 
</P>

CAMPUS & CAREER GUIDE; JOB MARKET BLUES; ECONOMY FORCES STUDENTS TO SWITCH 
CAREER PLANS OR LOWER GOALS

</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 During the mid- to late 1980s, talented accounting undergraduates at Cal State 
Northridge and elsewhere had only to pick their perks -- fancy dinners, sports 
tickets and even cruises -- from big accounting firms eagerly looking to hire 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 But it has been a long time since Cal State Northridge Career Center director 
Leland C. Gassert has seen any employers waving goodies in students' faces. 
Even before the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake struck, shutting down much of the 
campus for weeks, the number of employers bearing jobs for hopeful college 
graduates had been in sharp decline at the school, as well as at other colleges 
throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Although community colleges and universities keep churning out graduates, 
job-seekers are finding some of the toughest job-hunting in years. 
</P>
<P>
 With Southern California's recession dragging into its fifth year, the recent 
temblor has further dampened hopes that the region's economic troubles will 
soon begin to lift. Consequently, many students are having to downsize or 
switch career plans, and schools are trying to offer students more help in 
finding jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, the employment picture for new college graduates is looking better 
for the first time in several years, with surveys predicting about a 2% 
increase in hiring this year. But experts predict that the Southern California 
market will remain depressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we weren't in a recession, all of these were filled," Gassert said 
recently, pointing to display cases outside Northridge's Career Center that 
held just a smattering of job listings. Gassert said 1993 was the worst job 
market he has seen in his 22 years at the school, and 1994 is not looking any 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 Gassert said the number of employers recruiting on campus during 1992-93 was 
down 34% from two years earlier, the number of students interviewed was down 
41% and solid full-time job listings were down 16%. The numbers dropped again 
last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Career counselors on other Southern California campuses have had similar 
experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas A. Parham, director of the Career Planning and Placement Center at UC 
Irvine, said the numbers of employers coming to on-campus recruitment sessions 
dropped about 20% in the last two years, and those who continued to participate 
interviewed fewer students. Further, the widely reported troubles in the 
economy have discouraged students from trying for a job, so fewer students were 
signing up for appointments, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing some of our students deciding to apply to graduate school to 
ride out the recession," Parham said. 
</P>
<P>
 The poor economy also is spurring students and college officials to rethink 
their approaches to the job market. Student interest in fields such as business 
administration and accounting, once considered a sure thing, is on the decline. 
Students now are more willing to move out of the area in search of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The recession is forcing many graduates to take lower-paying or less 
prestigious positions than five years ago. And internships and other work 
credits are increasingly important, as today's graduates often must compete 
with more experienced workers who have suffered layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve McLean, 30, a graduate student in journalism at USC, had his heart set 
on a career in entertainment public relations. But he has added internships or 
part-time jobs in other specialty areas -- writing an insurance company 
newsletter and news releases for a campus publication -- to improve his chances 
of landing a job when he finishes his master's degree. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel it's important to broaden myself," McLean said, "but I also worry that 
if I spread myself too thin, my networking won't be too effective. It's a fine 
line, and I still don't know exactly how to travel it." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at some schools are adopting such measures as requiring all students 
to take an orientation class that would include career and job search issues, 
and devoting more faculty time to developing internships. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, counselors said, some of the bright spots locally for new graduates 
include health occupations such as nursing and physical therapy, environmental 
and workplace safety fields and teaching, especially for bilingual and special 
education instructors. 
</P>
<P>
 Job prospects for business administration, accounting and especially 
engineering majors -- the latter most related to post-Cold War declines in the 
defense industry -- have suffered the biggest drops since the high-flying years 
during the 1980s, campus counselors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gassert said the recruiting war over accounting majors in the mid-1980s became 
so heated at one point that prominent accounting firms called a summit meeting 
at USC with officials from area universities to try to stem the tide of perks. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers at UCLA who survey college freshmen annually to spot trends say 
that nationwide, the number planning business careers dropped by nearly half to 
14.3% in 1992 from a peak of 24.6% in 1987. Interest in engineering and 
accounting careers dropped less dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 But interest in health careers climbed from 12% of freshmen in 1988 to 19.6% 
in 1992, led by new career choice highs in nursing (5.7%) and 
medicine/dentistry (5.9%). Related health fields also rose sharply from 5.3% in 
1988 to 8% by 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, college counselors urge students to make their career choices based 
on the fields that appeal to them, not on the job demands of the marketplace, 
saying those are likely to change constantly. And they urge students to get a 
broad education that will give them job flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
 UC Irvine's Parham said he has seen "a real upswing" in interest in people 
with liberal arts degrees, a trend he applauds because of the broad, solid 
grounding it provides. He said he believes the best combination is a liberal 
arts degree with some technical training. 
</P>
<P>
 He also counsels students to be patient, allowing six to nine months for a job 
search that a few years ago would have taken two to three months to come to 
fruition.  
</P>
<P>
 "I tell students to look at an unemployment figure of nearly 10% and remind 
themselves that means more than 90% of people do have jobs," Parham said.  
</P>
<P>
 McLean, the USC graduate student, has tempered his outlook with practicality, 
however. "I am optimistic. I think I have the skills and ability to succeed," 
he said.

CAMPUS & CAREER GUIDE; IN CHOOSING A COLLEGE, RELY ON YOUR INSTINCTS; 
SELECTION: COUNSELORS ADVISE STUDENTS TO BE CHOOSY, VISIT THE CAMPUSES AND ASK 
A LOT OF QUESTIONS. YOUR COMFORT LEVEL SHOULD COUNT MORE THAN EVEN A SCHOOL'S 
ACADEMICS.

<TEXT>
<P>
 So a handful of colleges have decided to accept you. Now it is your turn to 
decide which one to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 College counselors and admissions directors recommend that you slip into the 
role of a choosy consumer trying to decide how to spend many thousands of 
dollars -- and the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Their advice: Visit the campuses you are considering. Look around. Compare. 
Quiz students, faculty, administrators and, most important, yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask yourself how comfortable you feel. Your comfort level, counselors say, 
should count for more than your assessment of whether one college is better 
academically than the next. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is that social discontent usually translates into poor academic 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're not happy socially or emotionally, it's going to be difficult to 
concentrate on your studies," said Michael Thorpe, the college counselor at 
Belmont High School in Los Angeles. "I tell my kids to trust their feelings, 
their intuition, their vibes." 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole college selection process is really a self-awareness process," said 
Laurice Sommers, college counselor at Hamilton High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Sommers advises her students to make their decision by "standing in the middle 
of a campus, closing their eyes and visualizing themselves there the next 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 That exercise, she said, will give a pretty good sense of whether you really 
want to be there. 
</P>
<P>
 Many counselors, including Thorpe and Summers, lead high school students on 
visits to college campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 They advise students to pick up the student newspaper, stop by the student 
activity office and scrutinize bulletin boards to get an idea of what's going 
on around campus. They also suggest asking college students what they like and 
don't like about their school, and talking with faculty members from 
departments that interest them to determine how accessible they will be. 
</P>
<P>
 If they are not accessible, it is important to know that in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Faculty should be receptive" to student inquiries, said Jack Wright, college 
coordinator at Franklin High School for a quarter-century before becoming a 
counselor at Santa Monica College. "You're the consumer." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Most college admissions officers give similar advice. They often help 
prospective students arrange overnight stays in residence halls and visits to 
classes and dining rooms to give them as accurate a picture of college life as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Katy Murphy, admissions director at Mount St. Mary's College in Los Angeles 
and past president of the Western Assn. of College Admissions Counselors, said: 
"We have no interest in recruiting students who are not going to succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 She advises prospective students to gather as much information as possible 
but, in the end, to heed their gut reactions. 
</P>
<P>
 An overnight visit will disclose warts not shown in brochures, giving a more 
realistic picture of dormitory life. It will also give students a chance to 
sample the food and observe how students mingle in the dining halls. 
</P>
<P>
 Colleges may brag about how integrated their classes are -- sprinkled with 
students from different racial, ethnic and economic groups. But dining rooms, 
where students sit with whom they wish, may tell a different story. 
</P>
<P>
 If students from different groups do not mix, counselors suggest you assess 
how well you would fit in with members of your group. If you happen to be a 
politically moderate Latino, for example, and Latinos at a college you are 
considering are organized in a radical political caucus, you could be made to 
feel uncomfortable -- by members of your own ethnic group as well as by 
majority students. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright also suggests that students research their financial obligations 
carefully. He urges students to visit financial aid offices at colleges they 
are considering and get written copies of aid policies to study. 
</P>
<P>
 It is particularly important to learn the circumstances under which grants 
might cease and aid might take the form of loans or work-study plans. Many 
students now graduate from college with debts of $30,000 to $40,000, Wright 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Colleges also suggest finding out how accessible teachers will be. At some 
major universities, that brilliant professor you've heard so much about may be 
occupied doing research and teaching graduate students (who earn their way by 
teaching you ). 
</P>
<P>
 Although there is no adequate substitute for experiencing a college firsthand, 
visiting is out of the question for many because of the expense of travel. 
</P>
<P>
 If you cannot go, do not give up, the counselors advise. Just do what you can. 
</P>
<P>
 Explore by phone. Ask your college counselor or the college admissions staff 
for phone numbers of students, alumni and faculty you can call. Many admissions 
offices will send you videotapes about their college. You can also buy 
guidebooks with student comments. 
</P>
<P>
 A good place to gather information about many colleges in one visit is the 
National College Fair, scheduled May 5 and 6 at the Pasadena Conference Center. 
The annual spring event is expected to draw representatives of about 200 
colleges. Shopping for a College 
</P>
<P>
 Here are 10 tips to help rate a prospective college: 
</P>
<P>
 1) Interview students who attend the college, particularly those with whom you 
share an interest or background, such as someone who attended the same high 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 2) Arrange to attend some classes in your prospective major. 
</P>
<P>
 3) Try to determine how accessible the faculty is. 
</P>
<P>
 4) Find out if teachers are evaluated by students, what the evaluations count 
for and if they are available for your review. 
</P>
<P>
 5) Thoroughly investigate financial aid availability. 
</P>
<P>
 6) Arrange an overnight visit in a residence hall. 
</P>
<P>
 7) Sample the food. 
</P>
<P>
 8) Find out about the social life. 
</P>
<P>
 9) Don't talk only to people suggested by admissions officers. 
</P>
<P>
 10) Keep asking yourself how you feel.

 By sheer scope, the Artists' Salute to Black History Month qualifies as one of 
the city's biggest annual events recognizing the contributions of African 
Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Works by more than 150 black painters, sculptors and other visual artists from 
22 states -- the largest exhibit of African American art in the country -- have 
filled both levels of the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza for the better part of a 
week.Besides the wealth of visual art on display, the salute boasts a schedule 
of special exhibit-related events. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's salute, titled "Our Children . . . Our Hope," includes a parade 
and ceremony at 11 a.m. today for elementary school children who have shown 
exceptional effort in their artwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Other events today, which conclude the salute, are an 11 a.m. forum with 
poster artist Sylvia Walker; a 1 p.m. forum with artists Tina Allen, Varnette 
Honeywood and Cheryl A. Moody, and a 4 p.m. forum with artists Michael Brown, 
Charles Dickson and Paul Goodnight. The exhibit closes at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other Black History Month events in Central Los Angeles this month: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Sweetwater Blues," a musical exploration of African American blues and jazz 
artists; 4 p.m. today; The Theatre of Arts, 4128 Wilshire Blvd.; (213) 883-1508 
($15). 
</P>
<P>

VOICES: QUAKE TOOK A BITE OUT OF HISTORY; SPIRES ON THE CITY'S OLDEST 
PROTESTANT CHURCH, BUILT IN THE ENGLISH GOTHIC CATHEDRAL STYLE IN 1932, WERE 
REMOVED BECAUSE OF POTENTIAL DANGER OF FALLING.

By Karen E. Klein and Thomas Hunter Russell, Thomas Hunter Russell, a 
53-year-old trial lawyer from Los Feliz, is a deacon and assistant organist at 
First Congregational Church of Los Angeles, the oldest Protestant congregation 
in the city. The church building, constructed in 1932, is at 6th Street and 
Commonwealth Avenue in the Mid-Wilshire district. During the Northridge 
earthquake, First Congregational's four distinctive tower spires were damaged 
and had to be removed. Russell, who serves as vice president of the Los Angeles 
Cultural Heritage Commission, was interviewed by Karen E. Klein. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Shortly after the earthquake struck we discovered that three of the four 
spires -- actually, they're called finials -- were at strange angles. Two were 
hanging very precariously. They had sheared off the tower during the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 We hired two big cranes that removed them all. The fourth finial was healthy 
but it was removed also. Had they not been removed we believe they would have 
come down during the aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 One could have hit people on 6th Street and the other two would have gone 
through the church chancel, the nave, the tower and the organs of the church. 
Each of those finials, had they come down, could have done $3 million to $5 
million worth of damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Each finial is 17 feet, 6 inches tall and each weighs about 12 tons. There was 
one on each corner of the central tower. Each had a four-way cross on top of 
it, and three of those crosses came off during the earthquake and rained down 
in pieces below. The finials were cast in concrete originally and lifted into 
position by crane and attached by reinforcing rods. 
</P>
<P>
 Those rods were all sheared through. The torque action at the top of that 
tower was tremendous. They are 200 feet up; that's the equivalent of the 18th 
to 20th floor. My office, in Hollywood at Sunset and Vine, is on the 10th floor 
and everything in it was moved around. 
</P>
<P>
 The church was established in 1867 and is constructed in the English Gothic 
Cathedral style. The building itself is an earthquake-resistant building and 
structurally there were no problems at all. 
</P>
<P>
 There was some damage to our Mudd Memorial Organ, mainly from parts of the 
organ that were high up falling on parts that are lower. We've gotten an 
estimate of about $75,000 worth of damage to that organ. 
</P>
<P>
 It cost over $100,000 to remove the finials and do some additional shoring at 
the top of the tower to assure that it was stable. 
</P>
<P>
 We expect that we will recast the finials out of a lighter material -- not 
concrete -- and replace them. But it will not be done immediately. There are 
more pressing matters right now, such as repairing the organ. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know what will be done, ultimately, with the old finials. Some members 
of the congregation have suggested that they might make good decorative 
elements -- possibly placed in the church's gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 The tower itself is really a landmark. But it doesn't look too bad, just 
stubbed off a little at the corners. What we do in the long run depends on the 
architectural and engineering reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, services were held as usual on Sunday and they'll go on as usual in 
the future.

GAME OF THE WEEK; CRENSHAW PUTS OUT DORSEY'S LIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The only bright spot for the Dorsey boys' basketball team Friday was when the 
lights went out. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Southern League game that had been postponed by the Northridge quake and 
delayed when power went out in the Dorsey gym Friday afternoon, Crenshaw rocked 
the Dons, 111-78. 
</P>
<P>
 But the lopsided score was not indicative of the fervor of the game, a rematch 
of last season's City 4-A championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 "This did not feel like a 33-point win," said Crenshaw forward Kristaan 
Johnson, who scored a game-high 26 points on nine-of-18 shooting. "They were 
definitely up for this game because of the rivalry. The intensity inside the 
gym was incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 It was that competitive spirit that kept the game close throughout the first 
half and midway into the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 With Crenshaw comfortably ahead, 56-38, Johnson scored 11 of the Cougars' next 
13 points including two three-point plays. After a sluggish first half, Johnson 
came out of the locker room and scored 18 of his 26 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost my focus in the first half and coach (Willie West) told me to 'go out 
and play basketball,' " Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Dorsey that lost focus and players late in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 With 7:15 left in the fourth quarter, Dorsey guard Ricky Blackmon, who led the 
Dons with 16 points, fouled out. Over the next 2:16, Sherwyn Morgan, who had 11 
points, and Will Shumate did likewise. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Tremaine Fowlkes had another big game for Crenshaw, scoring 22 points 
and grabbing 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Records: Crenshaw 16-2, 5-0, Dorsey 11-6, 3-2.

SOCCER; ROOSEVELT'S MISSED KICK GIVES GARFIELD A NARROW WIN 
</P>

 Roosevelt striker Vicente Mejia missed a second-half penalty kick against 
Garfield on Wednesday, and the Bulldogs held on to a 1-0 win in an Eastern 
League game. 
</P>
<P>
 After a scoreless first half, the Bulldogs opened the second by quickly 
penetrating Roughrider territory. Within two minutes, Julio Cesar Munoz scored 
on a rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 Garfield dominated most of the game, keeping pressure in the midfield and 
escaping the offsides trap to set up plays in front of the goal. The Bulldogs 
nearly scored again when striker Ivan Valente beat Roosevelt goalie Agustin 
Lopez from the right flank and sliced the ball between two defenders toward 
forward Romeo Cordova. But when Cordova slid to put the ball in, he knocked it 
out instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Roosevelt was awarded the penalty kick in the 60th minute when a Bulldog 
touched the ball with his hands in the penalty box.  
</P>

<P>
 Bell 8, Locke 0 -- Oswaldo Williams' hat trick gave the Eagles a 5-0 lead 
before the end of first half in a Central League match at Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles scored three goals against the Saint defense in the first 15 
minutes of the game. Ernesto Serratos opened the scoring on a breakaway. 
Williams followed with two more tallies, assisted Luis Castillo on the fourth 
and then scored the fifth goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles have scored 25 goals and have three against them in six games. 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate 3, Fremont 2 -- Riddled with yellow cards and ejections, the Rams 
nearly threw away their victory when the Pathfinders came back from a 3-0 
deficit in the final minutes of Central League action. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Osorio scored twice and Eric Salazar tallied once for the Rams, 
seemingly securing their team's third consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 One player from each side was ejected at the end of the first half for 
unsportsmanlike conduct. When the Rams lost another player to accumulated 
yellow cards late in the second half, Fremont made good on its one-man 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 With five minutes left, Pathfinder Pablo Gonzalez converted a penalty kick and 
Rene Lemus followed up with another score to close the gap to one goal. Lemus 
almost got the equalizer on the last play of the game when he shot from the 
edge of the penalty box, but the ball hit the crossbar. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Park 4, Jordan 1 -- Spartan striker Juan Cortez scored one goal in 
each half, both on personal plays, to lead the Bulldogs in an Eastern League 
match. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Park forward Jesus Cadenas found the net first on a header from a 
corner kick pass early in the game. Hector Ramos tallied shortly thereafter on 
a rebound from a shot by Mario Mendez for a 2-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaime Delgado narrowed the score on header from a corner kick pass, but Cortez 
scored the next two goals to secure the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincoln 3, Marshall 1 -- Carlos Ponce, Melvin Hernandez and Marcelino Salas 
each scored once for a Northern Conference victory.

advantage en route to a win.

SOUTHLAND HOUSING MARKET SHOWS SIGNS OF STABILIZATION

 After four years of declining home sales in Southern California, the region's 
housing market appears to have stabilized, according to TRW REDI Property Data. 
</P>
<P>
 TRW REDI's statistics, which are based on county recordation of property 
transfers, show that sales of new and existing single-family homes and 
condominiums in 1993 dropped by 1.3% from 1992 levels--a substantial 
improvement from an 11.4% drop in the 1991-1992 period. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange and Ventura counties, where the decline in sales was reversed into 
nominal increases, have emerged as the bright spots in the region. 
</P>
<P>
 TRW REDI notes that average selling prices continue to drop throughout 
Southern California, partly because homes selling in the more affordable price 
ranges, less than $175,000, are now accounting for a larger share of the 
transactions--51.8% in 1993 compared to 48.3% in 1992. Southland Home Sales

THE GONZALEZ FAMILY STRUGGLED TO FIND ITS MUSICAL NICHE FOR 13 YEARS. NOW, LAVA 
AND THE HOT ROCKS MAY BE . . . ; READY TO ERUPT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Gonzalezes were tired of waiting for fame and fortune to arrive for their 
family band. So tired that they decided to create their own fame using their 
own fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 After refinancing their Maywood home and taking the money that Hector Gonzalez 
received from a company buyout, the family independently produced Lava and the 
Hot Rocks' first commercial album last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Their gamble may have paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated with being denied by several record labels, Hector, 40, his wife, 
Miroslava (Lava), 38, and their son, Alex, 18, changed the band's eclectic 
style to alternative adult contemporary. And with their first, 
soon-to-be-released album, "You Damn Mexicans Are Too Loud," the band has found 
its niche. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been hard to get into the Mexican market because they don't consider us 
Latin. Even being of Mexican American heritage, we weren't recognized because 
we aren't immigrants," Hector Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The band began its tumultuous journey through the Los Angeles music scene 13 
years ago after Hector Gonzalez's barber introduced him to an attorney who 
recommended their demo album to former concert promoter Jerry Rissmiller. 
</P>
<P>
 "Musically they knocked me out," said Rissmiller, who agreed to become their 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 He said their blend of Latin elements and big-band sound leads to a bluesy 
jazz beat that is commercial and unique in a world where it is "very difficult 
to get airplay on any radio station, regardless of ethnicity." 
</P>
<P>
 With Hector on bass, Alex on drums and Lava on vocals, the group also features 
Mel Steinberg, 44, on saxophone, Alfred Ortiz, 23, on percussion and Karl 
Carrasco, 41, on keyboards. 
</P>
<P>
 The family writes songs by improvisation. Hector Gonzalez said he comes up 
with a rhythm and runs it by his son, who adds his ideas. Then they tape the 
piece and give it to Lava Gonzalez to write the melody and the lyrics.  
</P>
<P>
 Hector Gonzales describes themes for the band's songs as "home-grown." Lava 
Gonzalez said the bluesy songs she sings offer a unique way to discuss life: 
tales of love, war, pain and relationships. Many of their songs are inspired by 
her heritage -- she was born in Chinipas, Mexico, and moved to the United 
States when she was 1 -- and by the family's attempts to make it to the big 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Hector Gonzalez, who won an Emmy Award as a sound engineer for his work on the 
1984 Olympic Games coverage, said his connections at ABC and CBS allowed the 
band to make money while it looked for its niche. Those contacts and some 
late-night club gigs gave the band exposure during an Academy Awards wrap party 
and other industry get-togethers. 
</P>
<P>
 Networking also provided the Gonzalezes with an invitation to be the house 
band for the new PBS show "Somos Latinos," which will be produced by Robert 
Andrade and Associates and may begin taping as early as May. Andrade, who 
produces and directs KCET-TV Channel 28's "Life and Times," said Lava and the 
Hot Rocks has much to offer the music industry because of the "broad spectrum 
of their musical abilities." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The band has a busy summer schedule, starting in June with the Troubadours of 
Folk festival at UCLA. As part of the festival, the band will travel with 35 
other acts to Scandinavia and the Virgin Islands. And in August, Lava and the 
Hot Rocks will join five other groups on a three-month, 30-city tour. One of 
the band's upcoming local outings will be Feb. 18 at a Red Cross earthquake 
relief benefit at the Reseda Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gonzalezes' struggle for stardom started in 1981 when they began playing 
small Hollywood venues such as Carlos' n Charlie's, The Roxy, Club Lingerie and 
Coconut Teazer. 
</P>
<P>
 Hector Gonzalez was joined by his wife on his weekly gigs after he had 
encouraged her to explore her singing talent. Alex Gonzalez, who Lava said had 
been "banging on pots and pans since he was 18 months old," began playing drums 
with the band at age 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Gonzalez also found some daytime acting and drumming work on the sets of 
the television shows "Punky Brewster" and "Simon & Simon." His parents hired 
his aunt to shuttle him from the TV studios to school and then to the clubs the 
family played at night. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so tough on all of us, because the only time we got to spend together 
was when we were playing as Lava and the Hot Rocks," said Hector Gonzalez. 
</P>
<P>
 Lava Gonzalez said the family has stuck together even when job, parenting and 
performing responsibilities seemed overwhelming: 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all together. Hector's not in prison, Alex has never been in a gang. I 
think we send out a positive message to the Latino community."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL; COURSES GIVE TIPS TO BLACK, LATINO 
PARENTS

 Gloria Bradie always knew that parenting is not an easy job. But when she 
found herself in a police station after striking her teen-age son, she decided 
it was time to get help raising her five children. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are a parent, you are going to have a problem," Bradie said. "I never 
had problems with my kids when they were young, but when they got to be 
teen-agers, that's when the problems started." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly two years after Bradie was interviewed by police after she hit her son, 
she spoke before a group of parents and educators about the need for helping 
parents in communities such as South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 After a referral by a social worker, Bradie is now a graduate of Effective 
Black Parenting, a 15-week course offered by the Center for the Improvement of 
Child Caring. The center is part of the Rebuild Our Lives Parent Training 
Project. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-year project, funded by private and public monies, helps African 
American and Latino families learn to deal with problems by teaching parents 
culturally specific skills to improve communication with their children. 
African Americans participate in the Effective Black Parenting course, and 
Latinos are offered a 12-week course called Los Ninos Bien Educados. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the few programs in the country that gives parents the 
opportunity to look at the cultural clash they are involved with," said Kerby 
Alvy, a psychologist and executive director of the Center for the Improvement 
of Child Care, a nonprofit organization that works with parents. 
</P>
<P>
 For Maria and Santiago Cardona of East Los Angeles, the Los Ninos Bien 
Educados program helped them bridge the growing distance within their family 
that had evolved into arguments over food and clothing choices. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have your own culture, but when you come here this is another culture, 
and we've tried not to lose our culture as we adjust," said Maria Cardona, a 
Mexican immigrant who is a mother of 10, at a community meeting for educators 
and parents in South-Central. "My oldest son had problems with food and 
clothes. We'd constantly be arguing about these things and we'd both just end 
up angry. 
</P>
<P>
 "After we started the program, I learned a new approach. I let him vent his 
anger and then we would talk. I told him if you don't like the food then tell 
me what you want me to cook, or go out and buy what you want to eat if you 
don't like my cooking." 
</P>
<P>
 The parenting programs began as a response to the 1992 riots, Alvy said. "When 
the riots hit, we said if you really want to rebuild, you have to start with 
the family. It's the most basic thing -- to prepare a community, you have to 
work with families," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has already garnered the support of Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite 
Burke and city and school officials. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 14,000 of the 37,000 children currently in the county's foster care 
system are from the 2nd Supervisorial District, which includes South-Central, 
Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both courses focus on using a building-block approach to helping parents 
adjust skills they already use. Parents are taught ways to confront their 
children, how to discipline them and how to learn from their children, Alvy 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents, who hear about the programs either through social service agency 
referrals or by word of mouth, must commit to attending the classes and are 
provided with workbooks and assigned homework that often includes working with 
their children.

 Tired of the city's tarnished image, Patsy Carter had been waging a small 
battle against crime in her neighborhood with mixed success. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Carter is taking her fight to the streets along with members of the Doheny 
Neighbors, a small group of residents and business owners who are using rakes, 
brooms and shovels to combat crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "What people in Los Angeles don't realize is there is a correlation between 
clean streets and safety," said Carter, a member of the 23rd Street Neighbors 
Assn. "This is a statement to the people that we care. It's intended to say to 
absentee landlords, 'Don't think you can just take money out of the area.' This 
isn't just an effete matter, it can be a matter of life or death." 
</P>
<P>
 The group, made up of 11 organizations including Mount St. Mary's College, the 
Automobile Club of Southern California, other businesses, churches, residents 
groups and schools, united last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were concerned about security at the college," said Maria Lyons, director 
of student activities at Mount St. Mary's. Lyons contacted Councilman Mark 
Ridley-Thomas' office for help in getting no-loitering signs posted at the 
school's main entrance on Adams Boulevard. "They told me I had to contact the 
auto club and Lanterman School and get their approval. Well, I got their 
approval in a matter of seconds." 
</P>
<P>
 The experience left Lyons and representatives from the auto club and Lanterman 
thinking about how else they might work together. 
</P>
<P>
 "Individually, we couldn't have done a lot," said Sister Kathleen Kelly of 
Mount St. Mary's. "But collectively, we've come together and as a coalition you 
can really impact an area."  
</P>
<P>
 The group has committed itself to biannual neighborhood clean-ups, the first 
scheduled for this past Saturday. But the group said its efforts are meant to 
go beyond simply sweeping the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first step of rebuilding," said Carter. "You hear all this talk 
about how we're going to rebuild neighborhoods, but this is the most basic 
step." 
</P>
<P>
 Education and information are priorities the group hopes to share with 
residents.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've gotten numbers for a lot of services the city offers that we didn't 
even know existed," said Kelly. "Trash and the dumping of sofas and rubbish are 
a problem in this area, and now we have a number we can call." 
</P>
<P>
 The group has secured financial assistance from Ridley-Thomas, merchants and 
groups such as the auto club. Thomas' office provided $1,000 for the first 
clean-up and the city provided brooms, shovels and paint. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like we were all searching for something, for a way to pitch in," said 
Herman Fuette, manager of security at the auto club. "And this sends a message 
to people outside the community that says we care."

<P>
 Additional classrooms and a library are among the new features at the Al 
Wooten Jr. Heritage Center, which recently moved to 9106 S. Western Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, established in 1990, provides free tutoring and other after-school 
activities for youths 8 to 18. The new facility features three more classrooms, 
a library and additional office space, said Myrtle Faye Rumph, founder of the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 "This means we can have our classes uninterrupted," Rumph said. "Before, we 
only had one classroom and people had to walk through it." 
</P>
<P>
 The 6,125-square-foot facility will allow the center to increase the number of 
youths in the program, said Alyssa Shepherd, spokeswoman for the center. "We 
have twice the space to work with kids now," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center moved to its new location in November, but did not open until last 
month because the building was being refurbished.

 The city attorney's office has filed criminal charges against a South-Central 
man accused of illegally dumping oil and waste matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Luis Castro, 26, is accused of flushing automobile fluid down a storm drain 
after transmission fluid spilled while he was working on a car in Wilmington, 
according to the city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro, who was to be arraigned Tuesday, failed to appear in Los Angeles 
Municipal Court. If convicted, he faces up to six months in jail or a $1,000 
fine for illegally dumping oil and up to one year in jail and/or a $10,000 fine 
for dumping a hazardous substance on a public street. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in the middle of working on the car when a police officer from the 
city saw a streak of red transmission fluid, and they interviewed him and he 
didn't realize it was against the law," said Vincent Sato, the deputy city 
attorney handling the case. "It's a problem because once it hits the storm 
drain, it goes straight to Santa Monica Bay or the harbor. That's why we're 
trying to regulate this type of activity." SANDRA HERNANDEZ

<P>
 Two forms of relief were set up last week in Southwest Los Angeles to aid 
individuals and businesses still in need after the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 West Angeles Church of God in Christ in Jefferson Park joined forces with the 
Salvation Army to set up a disaster relief center for displaced individuals and 
families at the church-owned 20th Century Plastics building at 3628 Crenshaw 
Blvd. West Angeles communications director James Thomas said the timing of the 
joint venture could not have been better. 
</P>
<P>
 "The social services department at the church was running out of resources, 
and the need was growing," Thomas said. "We've seen so many first-timers since 
the quake. Fortunately, the Salvation Army happened to hear we were concerned 
with helping people in Central L.A., and they got together with us. They have 
the resources, we have the space. It was ideal." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas said the center, which is open 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. daily, anticipates 
staying in operation for at least another week. Volunteer workers are 
distributing food, blankets and sleeping bags to crowds that have averaged 
2,500 per day since the center opened on Monday, said Thomas.  
</P>
<P>
 To aid small businesses, Operation Hope announced last week the start of a 
program that will provide businesses with office furniture and supplies lost or 
damaged in the quake. Called the OHLA In-Kind Mini-Grant program, the project 
awards grants for up to $5,000 worth of office chairs, desks, file cabinets, 
typewriters, fax machines and other equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Processing centers are at the First African Methodist Episcopal Church in West 
Adams, the San Fernando Valley Chamber of Commerce, the Korean Youth Community 
Center in Mid-Wilshire and El Centro Pueblo in Echo Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The program has received $500,000 in office equipment from Imperial Thrift & 
Loan, First Federal Bank, 3 Day Blinds Inc., United Parcel Service, First State 
Bank of Southern California, Southern California Savings, the accounting firm 
Duitch and Franklin, and J & D Graphics. Applicants must have had 
earthquake-related damage, be underinsured or demonstrate a general need for 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was ready to spend $3,000 on office furniture, but now I don't have to," 
said grant recipient Jimmy Dodson, who owns Banjo's Yogurt and Deli in Leimert 
Park. "As a small business, it's great that I can conserve what capital I can."

businesses. "After the riots, her place was untouched while a lot of other 
places were in ashes. There's a reason for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was a successful entrepreneur who, along with her family, religiously 
practiced the credo of locating and investing in the black community. Although 
Brown and her husband, Herbert, were most visible as owners of Papa's Grocery 
at Vernon and Van Ness avenues, it was their scrap metal and construction 
businesses that, until recent years, gave them a solid financial base. Brown's 
Metal and Salvage once sold more than $40 million in recycled copper to 
Japanese companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's contracting company was building a 47-unit luxury condominium 
development in Baldwin Hills until the real estate market sputtered, forcing 
construction to cease in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Though it may have been the Brown family's least profitable venture, 
9-year-old Papa's Grocery was well-known for its immaculate appearance, quality 
merchandise and impeccable service. Brown took pride in making the store a 
model small business geared to serving the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelves were well-stocked with African American and Caribbean foods produced 
locally or imported. Brown also delighted in spending many hours each day in 
the back office of her store, hashing out deals with suppliers or chatting with 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "She loved everyone, and was just so kind and considerate," said Birdie 
Glover, a Crenshaw resident and longtime friend of Brown's. "She would do 
anything in the world for you." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown relished the fact that Papa's Grocery gave youths an opportunity to earn 
money as checkers and grocery baggers. She said the work changed young people's 
lives by making them adhere to a service ethic that forbade rudeness and 
stressed customer satisfaction. After her business was left unscathed by the 
1992 riots, Brown became a favorite subject for the media, who sought stories 
on successful black businesses.  
</P>
<P>
 Nasserdeen said his organization has already taken measures to ensure that 
Brown will not be forgotten. "We've already created a Patsy Brown Award to give 
every year to a deserving business owner," he said. "We can't let that kind of 
energy die." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown is survived by her husband, Herbert; sons Dennis and Patrick; eight 
grandchildren, and a grandmother, Lillian Harris. ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: LAFAYETTE PARK; QUAKE VOLUNTEER FORCE 5,000 STRONG

 Almost as soon as the shaking stopped Jan. 17, volunteers began calling the 
Red Cross to offer assistance. Some came from as far away as Virginia and 
Florida, but most volunteers live nearby and felt the earthquake themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were all shook up too, but they knew someone somewhere was in need of 
help," said Priscilla Schoch, the local disaster volunteer officer in charge of 
the American Red Cross's volunteer effort. "That's the bottom line with 
volunteers: They all want to help and they wear their hearts on their sleeve." 
</P>
<P>
 Working out of temporary office space set up at 672 Lafayette Park Place, just 
around the corner from the Los Angeles chapter of the American Red Cross, 
Schoch is coordinating a volunteer force that has reached nearly 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like a train station here the first couple of days," said Schoch, 
who ordinarily works with the Orange County chapter. But before long, most of 
the volunteers had fanned out to the service centers set up throughout the 
impacted area.  
</P>
<P>
 After giving the volunteers some basic training, Schoch assigned them to 
manage shelters, drive shuttles, cook and distribute food, assist with damage 
assessments, help case workers interview victims, translate, answer phones and 
operate computers and faxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There isn't anything that volunteers wouldn't be doing," said Schoch, who was 
on the verge of losing her voice. "There's a role for everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Red Cross hot line room the phones ring nonstop, and shelter addresses, 
emergency numbers and procedural information are written on poster paper and 
taped to the walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really intense here," said hot line volunteer Mary Moline. "There are 
thousands of calls. This is the nerve center where people tap into the system 
for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks after the earthquake, many callers were still looking for help, 
their nerves frayed. A small sampling of calls found people without food, a 
home or a job, people who had lost their medicine or needed to replace crushed 
eyeglasses. One caller said he felt like killing himself, but volunteers 
assured him that help was available. 
</P>
<P>
 Most hot line callers are instructed to contact the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency at (800) 462-9029 to register for an appointment with a 
counselor who can help clients get vouchers for food, rent, clothing, medicine 
and other needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trained to deal with oil spills," said hot line volunteer Richard R. 
Habrat, an engineer with the U.S. Department of the Interior. "But this job is 
really demanding, physically and mentally. People have so many tough questions 
and you have to know where to send them to get help."  
</P>
<P>
 Habrat's supervisors freed him up for five days to work on the hot line. He is 
coveted for his knowledge of several languages, including Polish, Russian and 
German. 
</P>
<P>
 "One lady who was (originally) from Armenia called and we spoke in Russian 
even though it wasn't her first language," Habrat said. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers, especially bilingual ones, will be needed every day until the 
relief effort is completed, Schoch said. She urged English-speakers who also 
who speak Armenian, Korean, Thai, Vietnamese, Chinese or Spanish and those who 
know sign language to volunteer as translators. 
</P>
<P>
 A few professional translators from the Omni Interpreting and Translating 
Network in Westlake Village donated their services for a couple of days when 
the courts were not in session. "They told me it was the most gratifying 
experience they had had in months," said company president Georges Ulmer.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: MID-CITY; RIOT VICTIMS SEEK AID TO REOPEN BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After nearly two years of frustration and disappointment, members of the 
Korean American Grocers' Victims Assn. gathered last week to boost their 
spirits and raise money to reopen their businesses and rebuild their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Victims of the 1992 riots, association members say their recovery has been 
stalled by conditions placed on them by the city, including such costly 
requirements as hiring security guards, providing additional lighting and 
limiting business hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Largely as a result of these conditions, only six of 174 Korean American 
grocery and liquor store owners have been able to reopen their businesses, 
executive director Min Paek said at a dinner Tuesday at the Radisson Wilshire 
Plaza Hotel. The dinner raised $8,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We understand that there are too many liquor stores, but these store owners 
were there legally," Paek said. "What they want to know is what is the city's 
plan for what they should do now. Whenever you put a damper on small-business 
people, you can't have economic revitalization." 
</P>
<P>
 "All these conditions, it's not fair," said Jae Yul Kim, the group's 
president. "I'm waiting for the city to do something, but I'm still looking for 
a business outside of L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Tina Y. Choi, a special assistant with the mayor's office, said a task force 
is reviewing the conditions, looking for compromises that would allow the store 
owners to reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 Paek said she hoped to keep the store owners from giving up by keeping them 
involved in lobbying efforts. "We have to make sure that the politicians are 
not just giving us lip service. We want to make them accountable as much as we 
are accountable. Our theme is 'Healing the Community,' and we hope that we can 
through our efforts." JAKE DOHERTY

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: MID-CITY; LIQUOR SALES LIKELY AT SHOPPING CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAKE DOHERTY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A city zoning administrator said he will probably grant permits for the sale 
of alcohol at a supermarket and drug store to be built at the Midtown Shopping 
Center provided sufficient security, lighting and restrictions exist to deter 
loitering and other problems. 
</P>
<P>
 But several of the center's neighbors who attended the hearing said that the 
sale of liquor at the two stores, under construction starting in April, is less 
troublesome to them than the center's swap meet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 27 hearing focused on the narrow issue of whether the Alpha-Beta 
supermarket and Sav-On Drugs store would be permitted to sell liquor. Store 
representatives said that liquor sales would be a convenience for shoppers, 
would constitute a small portion of their businesses and would be regulated to 
prevent problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Blackwell, a consultant to James Young, owner of the center's long-term 
lease, said liquor sales were a small but important piece of the entire 
development project that would bring jobs and other benefits to the community. 
"This is not a substitute for liquor stores," Blackwell said. "It's a matter of 
providing a whole range of groceries to the community. Anyone who is doing 
their shopping there should be able to get what they need at any time."  
</P>
<P>
 Plans for the 24-hour supermarket would limit liquor sales to 6 a.m. to 2 
a.m.; the drug store would close at 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich Waters of the Pico-Redondo Area Neighborhood Assn. questioned the need 
for additional liquor sales in a community where "liquor permeates.' But in the 
absence of vigorous community objections, Zoning Administrator Jon Perica said 
he was inclined to approve the permit requests. He said he would make his final 
decision within the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Many other issues were also aired at the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Marie Gaines of the Wilshire Area Community Coalition said many residents want 
to see the center's swap meet replaced with a more upscale retail store that 
would cater to a larger cross-section of the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura Meyers, representing the West Adams Heritage Assn., argued that the 
center's reconstruction after the 1992 riots and its ongoing remodeling should 
have been subject to a site-plan review by the city and a public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Young and Blackwell have attended several community meetings, but city 
planners determined that the extent of the center's development plan was not 
large enough to trigger a review and public hearing. The process so far has 
"bypassed the community" and its "right to have its say" about the project, 
Meyers said. JAKE DOHERTY

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: CHINATOWN; CYCLING COPS KEEP CLOSE EYE ON CRIME 
</P>

<P>
 When police officers roll on crime in Chinatown these days, odds are they will 
be on two fat tires. 
</P>
<P>
 Daily mountain bike patrols began a month ago, and police officials say they 
are already seeing results: Fewer gang members are gathering at Alpine Park and 
other hangouts. 
</P>
<P>
 They hope putting five officers in the saddle -- three during the day and two 
at night -- will build community trust while curbing robberies, gang activity 
and other crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials say the rugged mountain bikes are perfect for patrolling busy 
areas: They allow close contact with the community while offering greater 
mobility than foot patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the radio cars, the officers are mobile, but they are isolated in terms 
of contact. Foot beat officers have great rapport and direct contact, but 
aren't as mobile. Bikes are an ideal medium between those two," said Los 
Angeles Police Capt. Richard Bonneau, commanding officer of the Central 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Bicycle patrols have become increasingly popular nationwide, praised by police 
officials and community members alike. The Los Angeles Police Department 
deploys bike patrols at the beach and in other parts of the city, including 
Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Chinatown is ideal for bicycle patrols because it is congested with cars, gets 
heavy foot traffic and has many alleys and winding streets, Bonneau said. The 
cycling cops patrol the area bordered by Bernard, Alameda and Figueroa streets 
and Macy Street/Sunset Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonneau decided to assign bike officers to Chinatown after repeated community 
requests for increased police patrols. Community members' donation of two new 
mountain bikes, valued at $1,940, bolstered the patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 While keeping their eyes open for suspicious activity, the five bicycle 
officers -- Terry Cammack, Leonard Davis, Stacey Age, Brennan Booth and Joe 
Taylor -- are trying to get to know everyone in the community. The officers 
cycle into the residential neighborhoods as well as the business district and 
are even getting impromptu Chinese language lessons on the beat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going from merchant to merchant and learning as we work, writing down 
one phrase a day, like 'How are you today?' " Cammack said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to take a long time to develop (community) trust. Many people come 
from war-torn areas where Americans were the ones invading all the time. They 
may not be as open to trust us and tell us their problems." IRIS YOKOI

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; APPELLATE COURT TO RULE IN PROJECT FIGHT

<TEXT>
<P>
 Local activists continued their years-long battle against the Central City 
West development project last week by asking a state appeals court to rule that 
the city did not properly assess the project's traffic and other environmental 
impacts. 
</P>
<P>
 In arguments before the 2nd District Court of Appeal, an attorney for A Local 
And Regional Monitor (ALARM), a group of Echo Park, Temple-Beaudry and Elysian 
Park residents, contended that the city had a flawed General Plan to use as a 
guideline when it approved the Central City West development plan several years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other arguments, ALARM attorney Sabrina Schiller said that because the 
city's General Plan did not include a "public transportation" section, there is 
nothing that maps potential locations for transit stops or addresses how 
commuters and residents will get to and from the project area, which is west of 
the Harbor Freeway in the Temple-Beaudry community. 
</P>
<P>
 Schiller also argued that the sewer system plan the city has in place is 
outdated and does not address the impact of this development or future 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 She questioned how the city could approve the development project as 
consistent with the city's General Plan when the General Plan itself is 
incomplete, having been adopted and updated in bits and pieces. Because the 
city is now updating the General Plan again, Schiller said the Central City 
West project should be put on hold until the new plan is in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Development of Central City West has been slow to get off the ground because 
of the recession. One of the developers has considered selling its portion of 
the property to the Los Angeles Unified School District for a school site, 
which has triggered another community debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the city and the Central City West developers argued that ALARM 
has failed to show specifically what sections of their development plan do not 
comply with city guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 They also contended, as a Superior Court judge did in the 1992 decision siding 
with the city, that the General Plan merely provides guidelines that city 
officials can modify at their discretion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Guidelines (mean) 'should,' 'we'd like to,' " said Kenneth Bley, attorney for 
Center City West Associates. "(City officials) were not required to be put in a 
straitjacket." 
</P>
<P>
 Justices Joan Dempsey Klein, Patti Kitching and H. Walter Croskey may take 
anywhere from a few days to several months to render their decision. IRIS YOKOI

<P>
 The owner of a nonprofit corporation formed to help house the homeless has 
been sentenced to perform 500 hours of community service after pleading no 
contest to charges of slum conditions at his 67-room residence hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Municipal Judge Glenette Blackwell also placed Dondald Joseph 
Nall, 54, and his company, Peace House Inc., on three years' probation and 
ordered that the Beverly Hotel at 1330 S. Olive St. remain closed.Nall cannot 
transfer ownership of the property without court approval, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nall pleaded no contest in October to 10 fire, health, building and safety 
code violations at the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Nall, an Apple Valley resident, took over ownership of the hotel a year ago, 
when the previous owner, who himself was convicted twice for criminal slum 
conditions, signed over the building to Peace House. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Nall failed to obey repeated city orders to make repairs. 
City Slum Housing Task Force investigators said that during inspections last 
March and April, they found broken fire escapes, fire doors and smoke 
detectors; dangerous wiring and exposed wires, and accumulations of trash all 
over the four-story building. 
</P>
<P>
 Last July, after prosecutors filed criminal charges against him, Nall 
contended that the city had not given him enough time to fix the problems. He 
said he and the hotel's residents had begun repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy City Atty. Michael Wilkinson said Nall was given ample notice and 
that he could not use his nonprofit status to justify illegal activity. IRIS

<P>
 In an effort to offset the costs of complying with state and federal 
regulations, South Gate officials plan to contract out city staff members' time 
to other municipalities. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved a resolution last month allowing the city to 
contract out its planning services to other cities. Fees and the number of 
employees assigned to each contract will be set on a case-by-case basis, said 
Andy Pasmant, South Gate community development director. Pasmant oversees the 
city's planning division. 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate planners will offer consulting on air quality management, traffic 
congestion management, landscape and water ordinance compliance, and affordable 
housing and housing stock issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the state does not reimburse municipalities for complying with its 
mandates, cities must charge fees to recover these costs, said Todd Argow, 
South Gate city manager. South Gate will be able to keep these fees lower by 
farming out its staff, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a win-win situation for the other jurisdiction and for us. They are 
getting the service for far less than it would cost to do it themselves," Argow 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the council's resolution, planners would do contracting work in-house at 
South Gate City Hall. The resolution allows for planning services to be 
contracted out immediately, with an option of adding other services such as 
code enforcement and police. 
</P>
<P>
 Although city planners are currently "very busy," officials said additional 
work would not distract them from planning activities for South Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to take on the world. We'll weigh the amount of work we have 
from day to day. This is really a test case to see how much additional work is 
feasible," Pasmant said. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators plan to "aggressively market" the service primarily by word of 
mouth, Argow said. 
</P>
<P>
 The South Gate program joins a wave of privatization efforts by cities across 
the country as administrators attempt to cope with increasing service costs 
without raising taxes, said Bill Keith, director of research for the American 
Planning Assn. in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith said he is unaware of other cities that are farming out staff members as 
a means of keeping their general funds out of the red. JENNIFER OLDHAM

<P>
 The Bell Gardens Police Department will sponsor a dinner for four straight-A 
students from Bell Gardens Intermediate School at 6 p.m. Wednesday at the 
Gotham Grill, 5811 Firestone Blvd. in South Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 The students, fifth-grader Jennifer Lopez, 10, sixth-grader Vanesa Torres, 11, 
and eighth-grader Heidi Chang, 13, all of Bell Gardens, and seventh-grader 
Yessica Jovel, 12, of Los Angeles were chosen for the honor.Each had a 4.0 
grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials held an essay contest to choose the winners because five students in 
each grade qualified for the award, said Bell Gardens DARE Officer Michael So. 
The school includes fifth- through eighth-graders. 
</P>
<P>
 Students were asked to choose from three questions -- what they would do to 
improve their school, whom they trusted the most and why, or what they would 
tell their children. 
</P>
<P>
 So, who coordinates the DARE program at Bell Gardens Intermediate, created the 
recognition dinner "to provide an incentive for kids to achieve their potential 
in school."  
</P>
<P>
 The honorees, scheduled to arrive at the dinner in a limousine with their 
parents, will be asked to give speeches during the festivities for police, 
parents and Bell Gardens city officials. JENNIFER OLDHAM

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: CYPRESS PARK; RESTAURATEURS FACE DEADLINE OVER NOISE

<TEXT>
<P>
 The family that runs the Tlaquepaque Birrierias Restaurant has until Feb. 24 
to comply with restrictions ordered last fall regarding private parties or risk 
losing its operating license. 
</P>
<P>
 Associate Zoning Administrator Jon Perica will review talks between neighbors 
and restaurateurs Juanita and Rudolfo Torres conducted by Councilman Mike 
Hernandez's office. The restaurant is at 3618 Pasadena Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, Perica required the Torreses, who rent out the restaurant for 
private parties, to provide security, close the restaurant by midnight, 
prohibit public drinking and keep music at a level that will not disturb 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The restaurant has not caused the problems, but the owner has allowed the 
restaurant to be rented out for parties," Perica said at a recent hearing. 
"Neighbors complained of the people racing cars, arguments, fights, public 
drinking. We've got them on a short leash, and I'm hopeful that they can work 
something out." 
</P>
<P>
 The Torreses did not return calls made to the restaurant, or to a second one 
they own in Florence. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents on Marmion Way are tired of cars spilling out into their street and 
the loud noises coming from the restaurant's parties, said neighbor Lupe 
Martinez. Her neighbor, Manuel Arredondo, has videotaped some of the problems, 
even capturing a party-goer on tape firing a gun into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent party, "there were cars all over," she said. "They were running 
and screaming and urinating." 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Hatler, an aide to Hernandez, said he will set up a meeting for 
residents and the Torreses. His concern, he said, is to make the owners 
understand the proceedings so they will fix the problems now and save on the 
cost of appealing any decision against them in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "A number of conditions were put on the method of operating their business, 
and some of those conditions had not been complied with," Hatler said. "This is 
important for them to show why the license should not be revoked." MARY ANNE 
PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: BOYLE HEIGHTS; DOCTOR LAUDED FOR WORK IN COMMUNITY

<P>
 The California Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development recently 
recognized Dr. Hector Flores of White Memorial Medical Center for his work in 
addressing the health care needs of underserved populations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development runs programs to 
prepare college students for education in the health professions. Flores was 
enrolled in such a program before he began working at White Memorial in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "(This award) is showing that the state is reaping the benefits of its own 
programs," said Dr. Luis Samaniego, who along with Flores co-chairs the 
hospital's Family Practice Residency Program, designed to serve the Latino 
community in East Los Angeles with medical services and health care education 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores, 39, also serves on the Los Angeles County Health Task Force and has 
been asked to review the Clinton Administration's proposed health care plan for 
its impact on the Latino community. He was on vacation last week and could not 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Family Practice Residency Program helped the medical center change its 
focus from being a specialty care hospital to one that delivers primary care to 
the neighboring population, Samaniego said. It was started by Dr. Sanford Bloom 
in 1988, and then handed off to Samaniego and Flores. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, there were 62 primary care physicians serving 250,000 residents 
-- or one doctor for every 4,000 people -- in the Eastside and only one of 
those doctors was accredited by the American Board of Family Practice. In West 
Los Angeles, there was one doctor for every 400 people.  
</P>
<P>
 Then, as now, there was a critical need for primary health care in the 
community, and so the residency program was begun, Samaniego said. Now, there 
are 12 board-certified family practice physicians working at White Memorial and 
another 15 residents in training. MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: CITY TERRACE; FAMILIES LEARN, PLAY AT NEW CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The children were ecstatic as they ran down the stairs Monday to enter the new 
Eastside Family Literacy Center for the first time. Two of them kissed the 
walls and shouted, "Our school, our school!" 
</P>
<P>
 No longer will the Strengthening Family Ties program for children and their 
parents be conducted in two spare classrooms at the Garfield Community Adult 
School. And gone are the days when the family center teachers have to go out of 
their way to take a child to the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3,600-square-foot center, next to the adult school at 831 N. Bonnie Beach 
Place, more than doubles the space for the 65 children of Garfield students. 
They now have a large activity room, a classroom for the 2-year-olds, a nap 
room, kitchen, teachers' office and seven bathrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, they will plant a garden and soon they will have new playground 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all are just trying to get used to the space," said teacher Renee Haun, 
who has worked with the program since it began last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents and children spend half an hour together eating lunch, then another 
half-hour working on activities together.  
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the children donned plastic aprons, squished their hands in trays 
of paint and used their palms as paintbrushes on large paper hearts. Others 
rolled out gobs of molding clay and cut out shapes with cookie cutters.  
</P>
<P>
 After that, the children napped or were handed over to teachers and aides 
while the teen-age mothers attended one of three parenting classes required of 
them each week. Adult parents must attend one such class a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big help," said Sally Thomas, 17, who is taking classes to earn a high 
school diploma. Her 2-year-old son, Raymond De La Cerda, is enrolled in the 
program. "A lot of the teen parents just know one way of living. Here, we learn 
that we're not the only ones going through this." 
</P>
<P>
 Garfield Community Adult School Principal Dolores Diaz-Carrey got the idea for 
the center by watching some of the teen-age parents at the school. Often, she 
said, they would hand their children to their mothers and go off on their own. 
</P>
<P>
 That -- and the fact that only 1.5% of the children on the Eastside attend 
preschool, leaving them two or three years behind their peers when they begin 
kindergarten -- was the impetus to finding funding and starting the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're reaching the whole family," Diaz-Carrey said. "We believe that by 
strengthening family ties and supporting the education of entire families we 
can achieve our goal." 
</P>
<P>
 With 100 children on the waiting list, Diaz-Carrey is hoping to find more 
private funding to add staff. The center has room for 75 children at a time, 
but it is far from capacity because the children attend only during the hours 
their parents are enrolled in classes. 
</P>
<P>
 At capacity, the center would cost $400,000 per year to operate, and none of 
that money comes from the Los Angeles Unified School District, Diaz-Carrey 
said. She is seeking people to sponsor a child at $1,500 per year. The center 
has received funding from United Way and other charitable organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Students pay just $5 per week to cover snacks, making it easier for them to 
enroll their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Haun and other staff work with children and parents, teaching both to express 
themselves and learn together. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time they come in, they're a mom and then they're a student," she 
said. "(Parents) know that their child is in a warm, caring environment, and 
that allows them to study better." MARY ANNE PEREZ

WATTS STORIES; PHOTOGRAPHER CAPTURES ANOTHER SIDE OF LIFE AT IMPERIAL COURTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LUCILLE RENWICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Life in the apartments, gang circles and cliques of Imperial Courts is one of 
hopelessness, poverty and nihilism to outsiders, and to some who live in the 
project. But there is more to this picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the cliched images of gun-toting gangsters, unwed teen-age mothers and 
high school dropouts are the faces of people trying to get by. Some aspire to 
move beyond the run-down facades and grassless front yards. Others find 
themselves drawn there to visit family members or to hang out in a community 
where, despite problems, everyone knows everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless, they are all individuals whose lives transcend the faceless 
stereotypes of life in Watts. 
</P>
<P>
 For one month in 1993, Dana Lixenberg, a 29-year-old Dutch photographer, 
visited Imperial Courts. She hung out with the OGs -- original gangsters -- and 
young gang members, the mothers, sons and daughters, listened to residents' 
stories and captured portraits of a different side of Imperial Courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to show something that I didn't think was seen before. Through doing 
it, I just took what was given to me," Lixenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coming to Imperial Courts, at first it looks like life isn't really moving 
much, but underneath that, there's a lot of pain and a lot of passion, too," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lixenberg's initial plan was to photograph gang members in the area, but she 
decided to focus on residents in the low-rise housing project after meeting 
Tyrone Thomas -- known in the neighborhood as Tony Bogard -- of Hands Across 
Watts, a nonprofit organization formed to encourage the 1992 gang truce. Thomas 
was killed in a shootout last month in Imperial Courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tony was real skeptical about me photographing people. I don't think he 
wanted them to be exploited," Lixenberg recalled. "He really grilled me and 
asked me what good it would do for them and his people. I couldn't say. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "But each day I took another picture of another person, I learned something 
different." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 When he closes his eyes sometimes, Andre Fountain can picture himself riding 
the horses in the 131st Street stables, as he did when he was a child. From age 
4 he was jostled atop the horses, his father hollering instructions on how to 
hang on. At 12, he was breaking them in and would go home to 117th Street, just 
blocks away from the projects, covered in dust.  
</P>
<P>
 "They started calling me Dusty after that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The riding ended in 1983 when Fountain, then 16, was shot in the back after an 
argument and left paralyzed from the waist down. Gangrene required doctors to 
amputate his legs in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Dusty isn't too fond of the projects, although he occasionally comes up from 
Downey, where he lives with his sister, to visit family and hang out. "You 
don't have no yard and can't have no pets" in Imperial Courts, he said. "And I 
don't trust everybody over there."  
</P>
<P>
 He was a member of the Seven Boy Crips when he was young. Being part of a gang 
was part of the life. But that life is over now, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to tell these young brothers to go to school and get an education, and 
they say: 'You didn't go to school.' But I say: 'Don't you want to be better?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lixenberg spent entire days with residents, rarely prying into their lives, 
taking what they said at face value and observing the rest, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the guys, they spent a lot of time changing clothes and dressing up 
and just sitting around," she remembered. "They acted like nothing bothered 
them, but it always seemed like they cared but couldn't let it show." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "If I ever come up in life, I'll move my kids out for their safety, but I'd 
(come) back because this is all I know," said Grady Earl (One Love) Gordon, 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an OG from over here. I have to stay here for my homeboys," he explains. 
"This is my family here. One for one and one for all. But my kids, they don't 
need to stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon wants his children -- James, 12, and Deanna, 5 -- to be protected from 
the sorts of tragedies that have surrounded him. The worst was the death of his 
mother in 1989, shot in the head by a bullet that Gordon fired at his 
stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
 When he mentions his mother's death, Gordon's head hangs low with guilt. He 
loved his mother dearly, he said. He was trying to protect her from a man who 
Gordon said repeatedly beat her. But she jumped in front of the man just as 
Gordon fired at him. He is on parole for the incident, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life here ain't different, it's just harder," said Gordon, who moved to 
Imperial Courts with his family when he was 5. "We're all just trying to 
survive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The media (were) like intruders," said Lixenberg, who watched a stream of 
reporters flow into the projects to get reactions from residents last April as 
Los Angeles awaited the verdicts after the second Rodney G. King beating trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of the media spent time there," she said. "They would interview people 
for two minutes, but only show little bits and pieces. No more than that." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Velma Hill recalls the Imperial Courts of the 1970s with fondness. There were 
playgrounds, teen dances, roller-skating parties and neighbors concerned about 
one another. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was nice. People cared about people," said Hill, 31, known as Coco in the 
community. "Now, they just care about themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 There should be more activities for people, better playgrounds for the 
children and a curfew to keep people from being idle on the streets, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's never the place you live at that's the problem. It's the people," she 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Hill admits that her views are somewhat old-fashioned. It comes from her 
upbringing. One of 14 children, Hill grew up with her siblings and both parents 
in two apartments in Imperial Courts, connected by a door that was cut out to 
join them. The girls slept on one side, the boys on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill realizes that her family was an anomaly. Not for its size, but because 
both of her parents were there.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was lucky. Some people weren't blessed with a mama and daddy; we were," she 
said. "Even though we didn't have the best house, I had Christmas every year, 
Easter and Bible study with my mama and daddy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There wasn't nothing my dad wouldn't give us. And there wasn't nothing he 
wouldn't do for any other kid in these projects," she said of her father, who 
died in November. "Mr. Hill was always doing something for somebody."

 Edward Vander is better known as Peanut in the neighborhood around East 114th 
Street. His freckled face stands out when he passes through the streets. But he 
doesn't come by too often now that he lives in Long Beach. Peanut, 19, doesn't 
like the projects, said his grandmother, Cora Webb. 
</P>
<P>
 "With all these gangs, things were just getting too dangerous," Webb said. "He 
wanted to get away from that." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the tattoo that says PJW Crip on his right forearm is a constant 
reminder of his old stomping ground.

 "When I first walked in there, I think I represented something negative to 
them," Lixenberg said of residents' initial impressions of her.  
</P>
<P>
 Lixenberg grew up in Amsterdam and has lived and worked in New York City since 
1989. She came to Los Angeles in 1993 to photograph Watts with a grant from the 
government of Holland. Even with its problems, Amsterdam has nothing comparable 
to people's experiences in Watts, Lixenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I come from a very different culture and country, and my life is so 
different. For them, I'm someone from a really faraway place," Lixenberg said. 
"But it was important for them not to label me, just as I didn't want to label 
them."

 Inside the Korean-owned market he will manage when it opens on 114th Street 
across from Imperial Courts, Uzzi leans back on the laminated counter after a 
day of installing shelves and building walls and muses about life in "the 
Courts." 
</P>
<P>
 He's hopped around among cities in Los Angeles County -- Pomona, Gardena, 
Altadena -- but he has always come back to the projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came back because it's Watts, this is where I'm from," he said, as if the 
reason was obvious. "I have my friends, my family. I can't never forget where 
I'm from." 
</P>
<P>
 To prove his point, Uzzi pulls down his sawdust-covered T-shirt to reveal a 
fading tattoo, but an indelible reminder of his roots: Mr. Uzzi/PJW. 
</P>
<P>
 Uzzi, 31, whose real name is Herbert Taylor, got his street name because he 
could throw a lightning punch that could end any fistfight. 
</P>
<P>
 Uzzi pointed out, however, that he first got the name Uzziah from a cellmate 
in jail who saw him repeatedly reading the second book of Kings in the Old 
Testament. 
</P>
<P>
 There are few material things that Uzzi holds dear, he said. One, especially, 
is his discharge card from a three-year parole -- six days after his birthday.  
</P>
<P>
 "Best present I ever got," he said. "Ain't no way I'm going back."

 Jessica Patterson grew up in Imperial Courts, but there was no love lost when 
she left in September to live with her aunt on Crenshaw Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 She had no support system when she lived there, and after her mother died in 
December, 1992, she didn't see much point in staying. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just seemed when my mom died, there was no one living for me, so I had to 
live for myself," said Jessica, 16. "I had to move on to try and make my way." 
</P>
<P>
 She drops by Imperial Courts a couple of times a week to visit her aunt and 
some of her 15 siblings who live there. But the visits are short. A couple of 
hours is too long sometimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like it there very much," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Her feelings are not unusual. For many who leave the projects, there is no 
turning back. 
</P>
<P>
 What Jessica wants is an education and a chance to be a model or a nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't get it there," she said. "I hope I can get it now." 
</P>

 The last series of pictures Lixenberg took were of Tony Bogard. Bogard was 
skeptical until the end and was the hardest person to photograph, Lixenberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I photographed him at his house (on 64th Street) and he stood really still, 
like a sculpture. I don't know if he was shy or not. But it was some of the 
best photos I got." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Bogard, a gangbanger-turned-peacemaker, was considered a leader to many in 
Imperial Courts, where he grew up. But not everyone agreed with his approach to 
ending the killings in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Bogard realized the danger in what he did -- he carried a gun and wore a 
bulletproof vest. But he wasn't wearing the vest when he was killed in a 
shootout, allegedly by two members of his own gang -- the PJ Watts Crips. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can't nobody take Tony's place walking through these projects and trying to 
keep the peace," said Cheryl Wilborne, a resident of Imperial Courts who knew 
Bogard since he was young. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wasn't perfect, but he was a role model for some people here," she said. 
"That was all we had. But one of his own had to take that away." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lixenberg admits that a month was not enough time to come close to 
understanding Imperial Courts or any community. She is not sure how long it 
would take. 
</P>
<P>
 "The difference now is when I hear of South-Central or L.A., for the first 
time I can say I was allowed to see a part of people's lives."

FORMER ACE DELIVERS A TIMELY PITCH; EX-DODGER DON NEWCOMBE FOUGHT ALCOHOLISM TO 
BUILD A CAREER AFTER BASEBALL. HE WARNS STUDENTS NOT TO REPEAT HIS MISTAKES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The windup hasn't changed, nor has the delivery. Don Newcombe still throws his 
pitches high and tight. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of trying to strike out the Bronx Bombers, the former Dodger 
pitcher now faces a more challenging group of heavy hitters. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Newcombe made his pitch to high school students from Dorsey, 
Verbum Dei and Pasadena Muir. He reminisced about his old playing days, and he 
also managed to sneak a few curves past an unsuspecting audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "If God wanted you to talk more then listen, he would have given you two 
mouths and one ear," Newcombe said. "The only way to become educated is to 
learn how to read and learn how to listen. So zip up your mouths and open your 
ears." 
</P>
<P>
 The students were attending a symposium on the Negro Leagues in recognition of 
Black History Month at the Amateur Athletic Foundation in West Adams. Newcombe 
pitched with the Newark Eagles of the Negro National League before he joined 
the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1949, becoming the fifth African American to break into 
the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want young black people to become educated so that one day they can be 
somebody," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Newcombe has given speeches to more than 2 million people ranging from 
schoolchildren to chief executive officers. The speeches vary, but the theme 
remains the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "The life you have now is the only one you get," he said. "You can't burn it 
out with drugs, or drown it with alcohol, turn it in and get a new one." 
</P>
<P>
 Newcombe is a recovering alcoholic who has been sober for 28 years. He has 
been director of community relations for the Dodgers since 1970, and for 14 
years headed the team's alcohol and drug program, the first of its kind in the 
major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most in attendance were not born when he threw his last pitch in 
1960, the 67-year-old Newcombe still commands respect. He is recognized as a 
player who used his fastball to brush back racism and throw it out of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never worried about racists," Newcombe said. "I could throw a pitch 100 
miles per hour. I didn't always know where it was going, but I could throw it 
high and tight." 
</P>
<P>
 Though at first he couldn't name the major league team Newcombe played for, 
Chad Kiel, a 15-year-old sophomore at Verbum Dei, said: "I consider him a role 
model because he is a successful black person who came out of a ghetto. The 
average black male does not live past the age of 25 in this city." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dorsey junior Pamela Askerneese: "I thought it was inspirational to hear 
from one of the early black athletes. There is so little that has been written 
about them. We need to know our history if we're going to understand our 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 Newcombe grew up struggling to survive poverty and learning to play baseball 
on the sandlots near his Elizabeth, N.J., home. His father, a chauffeur, was a 
strict disciplinarian, but Newcombe said he was both a role model and a friend 
to his four children. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were four boys raised in a ghetto, but we never got in trouble," Newcombe 
said. "We had cockroaches and bedbugs. We didn't have gangs, but we had our 
cliques. Our father was away from home all the time because of work. But we 
knew if we got in trouble, Dad would come back and chastise us." 
</P>
<P>
 But negative influences were also to be found at home. When he was 8 years 
old, Newcombe had his first beer. His father approved, believing it would help 
him grow big and strong. He didn't live long enough to see how alcohol brought 
his son's playing career to a premature end. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a neighbor, John Grier, who refined Newcombe's athletic talent and 
helped the youth through adolescence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was fortunate to live next door to a man who was 12 or 14 years older than 
me that could golf, play tennis and baseball," Newcombe said. "He taught me how 
to control my pitches, how to hold runners on base. He even took me out with 
his girlfriend and his girlfriend's sister on dates when I was 15. He taught me 
how to be a man." 
</P>
<P>
 Newcombe dropped out of high school when he was a junior to play baseball in 
the Negro Leagues. After three seasons, he made his major league debut in 1949 
and was the second Dodger to win National League Rookie of the Year honors. In 
1956, the 6-foot-4, 240-pound pitcher won 27 games and was the National League 
Most Valuable Player. 
</P>
<P>
 But Newcombe's drinking problem also followed him into the major leagues. From 
1949 to about 1955 he began substituting beer for mixed drinks. The Dodgers 
traded Newcombe shortly after they moved to Los Angeles in 1958, and his 
playing career ended two years later. 
</P>
<P>
 After 14 years on the speaking tour, Newcombe has discovered how alcoholism 
has remained a major problem in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I once spoke to 500 junior high school students. I asked how many of them 
have not tasted alcohol to put up their hands. Only five children raised their 
hands, and that's junior high school." 
</P>
<P>
 But should children turn to a recovering alcoholic for advice? 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell children today, don't look at me as a famous ballplayer," Newcombe 
said. "Look at me as a person who used alcohol and screwed up his life. Alcohol 
was the reason I got into trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 At one time, Newcombe became so desperate to pay for his drinking habit that 
he pawned his 1955 World Series ring and an expensive watch at a shop in Watts. 
The jewelry was later bought and returned to him by Peter O'Malley, who was 
then Dodger vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 "He brought me into his office and handed me an envelope with the ring and the 
watch," Newcombe said. "I had forgotten all about it. When I opened the 
envelope, I cried like a baby. That's how alcohol took a big, strong body to 
the depths of despair." 
</P>
<P>
 Newcombe owns a marketing recently divorced his second wife after 30 years of 
marriage and has three children in their 30s. He is proud that all three have 
graduated from college. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't made to go to high school because my parents did not think it was 
important," Newcombe said. "When I got out of baseball, I had to learn how to 
educate myself. Thank God for baseball, because that's where I learned to be a 
good listener."

 In a review of "The Bread of Time" by Philip Levine (Jan. 16), Richard Eder 
referred to the poet as born illegitimate. The book is a series of first-person 
sketches, essentially autobiographical, and fictional in avowed but unspecified 
part. Eder regrets getting the part wrong, thanks the utterly legitimate Levine 
for a gentlemanly letter, abashedly apologizes to his mother, and points out 
the risks if New Autobiography is going to take on the fictional liberties of 
the New Journalism.

SAN JUAN'S PAST, FUTURE MEET DOWNTOWN; REDEVELOPMENT: THE CITY MUST BALANCE THE 
INTERESTS OF PRESERVATION AND COMMERCE WHILE CONSIDERING HISTORIC TOWN CENTER 
PLANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A wealthy rancher rides in from the dusty hills to rescue a financially 
struggling town. He and a local saloon owner round up more than $1 million in 
cash and promise to buy an entire city block, outmaneuvering a band of 
out-of-town investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Millionaire rancher Richard J. O'Neill's recent bid to buy a major chunk of 
downtown San Juan Capistrano may play like a spaghetti Western, but it's 
actually the latest real-life chapter in the history of this city, one of 
California's oldest communities.  
</P>
<P>
 O'Neill's plans -- although as yet unspecified -- have stirred up new 
questions over an ongoing local dilemma: How does historic San Juan Capistrano 
inject new life into its aged, Spanish-style downtown while still preserving 
its history? 
</P>
<P>
 It is a question that has plagued the city for two decades. But it has new 
life with the arrival of O'Neill and the anticipated unveiling in the coming 
months of the city's plans for a new downtown renovation called the Historic 
Town Center. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are hoping that O'Neill, other prospective downtown investors 
and the town center project will bring economic vitality to the city without 
sparking another battle between two powerful local political factions -- the 
historic preservationists and downtown business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "City leaders since the mid-1970s have given an enormous amount of thought 
about what should occur in the historic downtown," Councilman Gary L. 
Hausdorfer said. "Hopefully, what evolves there will be something that is 
pleasing to all the competing political interests in town." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, keeping peace downtown has not been easy. The city's 
redevelopment agency, which was launched in 1983 to inject new vitality in the 
city and now owns most of the downtown, is the moving force behind new projects 
and owns the land that O'Neill wants to buy. In town, the agency is regarded as 
a villain or a savior, depending on who you ask. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents on the preservationist side, such as Dr. Roy Byrnes, a former mayor 
and city councilman, charge that redevelopment has over-commercialized a 
charming old city, bringing in traffic and tourists at the expense of a bucolic 
way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Redevelopment in San Juan Capistrano has been a severe mistake," Byrnes said. 
"The whole thing was a foolish adventure and the people with their hands on the 
wheel running this city should have known better." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonsense, said Ken Friess, a former 17-year city councilman who helped launch 
the agency and continues to be its outspoken promoter. He is now a downtown 
builder and consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any objective person can go downtown on a Friday night and see 
the life, the vitality there and say it was a mistake," Friess said. "None of 
that could have happened without the redevelopment agency." 
</P>
<P>
 Like it or not, the redevelopment agency will remain a downtown player, 
largely because it owns about 10 acres of city property straddling El Camino 
Real, just south of the 218-year-old Mission San Juan Capistrano. The O'Neill 
parcel along Ortega Highway across the street from the mission is also agency 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 Later this month, the City Council is expected to vote on whether to sell the 
property to the rancher. O'Neill has declined to comment during the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, city planners have labored painstakingly to avoid a replay 
of what occurred in the late 1980s, the last time the redevelopment agency 
planned a town center along El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
 While preparing environmental documents for a proposed hotel and commercial 
project in 1988, city workers discovered a wall of buried 200-year-old adobe 
bricks, determined to be an old portion of the mission's barracks. 
</P>
<P>
 The preservationists erupted and, within months, their outcry halted the 
complex and chased the San Diego-based developer out of town. Downtown 
businessman Paul Farber, whose own Franciscan Plaza project was caught up in 
the protest, still shudders at the thought of that time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city at that time suddenly became very political, very political," Farber 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, however, city officials insist things are different. By summer, six 
new historic town center proposals will be unveiled.  
</P>
<P>
 Meant to embody both the new and old of San Juan Capistrano, the range of 
projects is designed to appeal to diverse interests, including a plaza, a 
museum, and archeological sites interspersed with shops and restaurants, city 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 And this time the planning process has been staffed side-by-side by business 
leaders and preservationists, said City Manager George Scarborough. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we are doing is responding to a community process with unprecedented 
community involvement that is underway as we speak," Scarborough said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hausdorfer, who was a backer of the old hotel project and is the only 
remaining council member from those days, now says it may all work out for the 
best.

 "We will never know how that project would have evolved . . . but ironically, 
it has all turned out to be a positive," Hausdorfer said. "It has given the 
residents the opportunity to do some things that otherwise might have been 
impossible. We now have an opportunity to make an intelligent decision, a truly 
rational decision."

 The bride wore a lacy beige dress. The groom was in a freshly pressed red 
shirt. And the guests were sprawled on cots nearby.  
</P>
<P>
 A few people nodded off during the ceremony, but Lorraine Cronjager and Ron 
Barklow didn't seem to notice. They were too busy looking at each other 
Saturday night as they became the first couple to get married at the National 
Guard Armory. 
</P>
<P>
 Cronjager and Barklow, who are both homeless, nervously exchanged wedding 
vows, promising to care for each other "in sickness and in health, for richer 
or for poorer." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the culmination of a whirlwind three-month courtship in the shelters 
and on the streets of Santa Ana, where Cronjager, a former waitress in her 
mid-40s, and Barklow, 40, a former warehouse worker, both searched for 
friendship and respect. They found it in each other.  
</P>
<P>
 "I know it will work," Cronjager said as she twirled her bouquet of pink 
carnations just before embarking on her sojourn up the aisle between the 
gymnasium's cots. "We're a lot alike and we've both been through a lot."  
</P>
<P>
 Cronjager, who is from Newport Beach, has been married twice before, each time 
for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Barklow, whose red shirt and black slacks were donated for the wedding, said 
he doesn't quite know what to expect because he's never been married.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't plan on getting married again. She's the right woman. That's the way 
I feel," Barklow said.  
</P>
<P>
 The wedding brought an evening of excitement to the armory, where the county 
provides food, showers and beds to about 100 homeless people on cold winter 
nights.  
</P>
<P>
 As banda music and the song "Tomorrow" from the musical "Annie" blared from a 
stereo, Orange County Clerk Gary L. Granville officiated -- free of charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew what the conditions were, and so it would be fiendish for me not to," 
Granville said. He also waived the fee of $62.50 couples normally pay for a 
marriage license. 
</P>
<P>
 Groomsman Valdivio Harvey, who has been homeless about six months, said he 
wished the couple great happiness. "Having someone is important, because if you 
don't have the necessities the other people have -- a companion -- you're very, 
very sad," Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony, replete with two wedding cakes, sparkling cider, and the 
throwing of the garter and bouquet, brought some uncommon joy to the people who 
call the armory home during the winter, said Maria Mendoza, the county director 
of homeless issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are not a lot of things for these people to look forward to. Times are 
pretty tough," Mendoza said. "But the little community around the shelter has 
been cheered up by all this. Someone has found a bit of happiness."
