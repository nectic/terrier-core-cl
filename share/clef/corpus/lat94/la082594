 SAFETY NET: Susan Eberhart holds a traditional American view of immigrants and 
public school. Her words echo the inscription on the Statue of Liberty. . . . 
"If you live in our neighborhood and you're the right age, come to our school," 
said Eberhart, who runs a social service network at Ventura's Sheridan Way 
Elementary School (B4). . . . "We want you to be in school. No questions 
asked." The veteran teacher said many immigrant families look to Sheridan for 
social services because that's where they feel most comfortable. "We work so 
hard at making school a safe place." 
</P>
<P>
 BIG TOP: Circus Vargas shifts its one-ring circus from Simi Valley to Oxnard 
starting today. That's right, one ring. . . . It's not the lousy economy that 
has caused the circus to shrink from three rings to one. Seems the big top 
recently entered the modern era with its purchase of one big hand-sewn tent 
made in Italy. . . . "In Europe, it's very common to have one-ring tents," 
Circus Vargas spokeswoman Marguerite Mohney said. "With three rings, you 
couldn't see everything." 
</P>
<P>
 ENDLESS SUMMER: The quest for the perfect wave is not without its hazards 
(Ventura County Life, Page 8). . . . Take localism, for instance. Stan Fujii, 
longtime surfer and owner of the Ventura Surfshop, says locals still jealously 
guard coveted surf spots. . . . "It's pretty safe to name spots that are easily 
accessible," he said. "But when you start naming spots that are a little hard 
to get to, that's when you start getting into trouble. What's the adventure if 
you give all the work away?" 
</P>
<P>
 AUCTION BLOCK: Jared Williams of Thousand Oaks loves his lamb. The 10-year-old 
has raised "Spud" since the day the fleecy white critter was born. . . . But at 
week's end, Jared will join hundreds of other children who will put their 
animals on the auction block at the Ventura County Fair (B1). Most will jump 
right to the chopping block and end up wrapped in cellophane in the meat case. 
. . . "It'll be tough," Jared reasons. "But like I always say, it's a way of 
life. It's the way it has to be."

ART REVIEW; TAKING A CRASH COURSE IN THE 'SPIRIT OF FLUXUS'; A LARGE, AMBITIOUS 
EXHIBITION AT SANTA BARBARA MUSEUM OF ART LAYS OUT THE TERRAIN FOR THE RAUCOUS 
MOVEMENT THAT BEGAN IN '61. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ben Vautier's sculpture "Ben's Museum" is a stark encapsulation of the wittily 
insightful rigor of which Fluxus art of the 1960s and 1970s was capable. In its 
way, though, it also exposes a certain flabbiness within the movement's core. 
</P>
<P>
 The sculpture, which turns up near the end of the large and ambitious 
exhibition "In the Spirit of Fluxus," newly opened at the Santa Barbara Museum 
of Art, is composed of a large wooden packing crate -- the kind in which 
paintings are typically shipped or stored. The crate stands upright and is 
partly opened, like a book. 
</P>
<P>
 Displayed inside are a variety of objects -- small paintings, toys, assemblage 
sculptures -- many accompanied by Vautier's familiar, graffiti-like ruminations 
on art, modern absurdity and the yearning for a kind of primitive spirituality. 
Accompanying instructions say that the open crate should be closed slightly as 
time goes by -- 10 centimeters a year, to be precise, until finally the crate 
is shut tight and packed off to permanent storage. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the almost ceremonial process of slow closure is an eloquent metaphor 
for the inevitable passage of contemporary culture into history, and for the 
distinctly modern transmutation of vibrant life into the sorted, boxed and 
catalogued archeology of the museum. What's flimsy about the piece, though, is 
the unmemorable stuff Vautier packed inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at the cornball knickknacks, which are meant to stand for traditional 
works of art, you can't help but eagerly anticipate the moment when the crate 
is indeed tightly shut. Then, the unviewable objects secreted inside will be 
transformed into mysterious talismans that, paradoxically, will at last be 
endowed with something more than their present condition of matter-of-fact 
curiosity. As in the alchemist's dream, lead will have turned into gold. 
</P>
<P>
 That Vautier's crate is a packing case specifically for paintings is itself an 
acerbic acknowledgment of the traditional hierarchy within the modern 
commercial system of art, wherein painting rules. Fluxus artists, wanting to 
disrupt the entrenched routines of art and life, used guerrilla theater, 
electronic concerts, mass-produced broadsheets and the ubiquitous motif of 
sculpture-in-a-box, replacing commonly sober considerations of artistic style 
with a temperament of jokey anarchism. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Barbara show, organized last year for the Walker Art Center in 
Minneapolis, does a good job of laying out the terrain of the raucous movement, 
which began in Germany in 1961 and quickly spread throughout Northern Europe, 
the United States (especially New York) and Japan. (The mail helped the 
international spread, as a genre of postal art flourished.) If you want a crash 
course in Fluxus, you couldn't get a better one than this. 
</P>
<P>
 George Maciunas, the reigning godfather of Fluxus, is well represented, as is 
the work of such other influential artists as Nam June Paik, George Brecht, 
Joseph Beuys, Claes Oldenburg and Robert Watts. There are also lesser lights, 
such as Ken Friedman and Yoko Ono. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some surprises, too. If Beuys and Oldenburg were only briefly 
affiliated with Fluxus, who knew that Per Kirkeby, a prominent abstract painter 
of the past dozen years, likewise made Fluxus objects earlier in his career? 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the show is drawn from the sprawling and important Gilbert and Lila 
Silverman collection in Detroit, which was begun in 1978, the year of Maciunas' 
untimely death from cancer and pretty much the signal of the final demise (long 
overdue) of Fluxus as a lively movement. A big chunk of the Silverman 
collection has been seen in Southern California before -- in 1983, at Caltech's 
former Baxter Art Gallery -- and it has been the subject of four substantive 
publications, the most impressive being 1988's 600-page "Fluxus Codex." 
</P>
<P>
 So, Fluxus is not exactly suffering from obscurity or neglect, although you do 
get an aggressive whiff of evangelical fervor from the show. It's there in much 
of the art, too. 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to see why. The anarchistic spirit of Fluxus is akin to the 
irrational provocations of Dada, which exploded in Europe during World War I, 
very much in heated response to the unprecedented, even unfathomable carnage of 
the Great War's brutal conflict. Fluxus had its unspeakable war, too: The 
American misadventure in Vietnam was catalytic for many artists, in both the 
United States and Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 This important social platform for a many-sided assault on traditional 
aesthetics mixes with distinctly personal motives, as in Vautier's frank 
admission that he lived inside a storefront for the duration of a 1962 Fluxus 
exhibition simply because he yearned to be famous as an artist. (A 
reconstruction of the storefront is at the entrance to the exhibition.) As the 
era passes, though, the social matrix inevitably fades from view, while the 
sense of self-indulgence remains intact. 
</P>
<P>
 You have to work at keeping the conflicted period of the 1960s fully in mind, 
so as not to succumb to a dreamy nostalgia for Fluxus purity. Carolee Schneeman 
helpfully bursts any such bubbles, with a case full of pointed notations on the 
commonness of misogyny among Fluxus artists. 
</P>
<P>
 One big difference between Dada and Fluxus is the degree to which the behemoth 
of mass culture loomed large in the 1960s -- and still does. For if the 
collision between mass production and the individual provided much of the 
insouciant energy for Fluxus, which promoted mail-order art as a way to 
undercut the preciousness of unique paintings, so the lure of mass 
entertainment is inescapable in the exhibition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say it's not really art at all," a museum trustee brightly declared to me 
while perusing the show. "But it sure is fun!"

THEATER REVIEW; A PERFECT GENTLEMAN AT 'DINNER' IN NEWPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Kaufman and Hart wrote a play, the partner who came up with the idea was 
credited first. Thus, Moss Hart and George S. Kaufman's "The Man Who Came to 
Dinner," at the Newport Theatre Arts Center, was Hart's idea. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, it was critic Alexander Woollcott's idea when, after exerting a 
two-week stranglehold on Hart's home hospitality, he asked, "Why don't you 
write a play for me?" 
</P>
<P>
 The partners did, but Woollcott wasn't secure enough to play himself, so the 
part went to an unknown college drama teacher named Monty Woolley (and launched 
him on a long stage and film career). Since then the role has fallen to portly 
gentlemen with full white beards and an ability to be irascible but lovable. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Kokol, as Sheridan Whiteside in this production, couldn't be better, as 
wild and Woolley as they come. It's a difficult role to make work, with its 
sharp comic flights shaded by an underlying gentleness. Kokol sparkles as 
though to the bad manner born. If only he didn't mispronounce Pago Pago. 
Whiteside knows better. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Jack Millis has put a jewel of a production around Kokol. Although 
Bill Cole's prop-deficient period living-room setting looks as though the 
Stanley family moved in the day before minus their household goods, it's a 
serviceable framework for the small core of good performances that make the 
staging come to life. 
</P>
<P>
 Manny Siegall is properly stuffy and narrow-minded as the small-town bigwig 
who is playing unwilling host to the famous Whiteside, and Tom Hardy is fine as 
the bumbling surgeon who attends the star, whose hip injury has forced his 
terrifying personality upon the small-town household. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Smith and Megan Endicott couldn't be more ideally matched to the period 
as the Stanley son and daughter, and Sally Norton is solid as Harriet, the 
dingy Stanley aunt with a lurid past. 
</P>
<P>
 Whiteside's coterie really shines. 
</P>
<P>
 Laura DeMilita is wonderful as his secretary, Maggie, and Jonathan Kass 
excellent as the small-town editor she falls for. Della Lisi has a good sense 
of the stardom surrounding her character, Lorraine Sheldon, who was based on 
Gertrude Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Carlton is based on Noel Coward, a Wollcott contemporary, as are all 
the characters, and is played with plummy elan by John Arthur. Banjo, the Harpo 
Marx character, is given just the right bounce by Mitchell Nunn. Alexandra 
Hoover stands out as the continually disintegrating nurse Miss Preen. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The supporting cast doesn't always rise to the same level. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth Siegall's Mrs. Stanley fidgets in a paroxysm of giddiness that is 
disconcerting. And the director must not have been watching Joshua Wright at 
rehearsal. With three inconsequential walk-ons, Wright walks like Groucho and 
leers seductively at Lorraine Sheldon, bumps into doors and otherwise 
misbehaves in a most unprofessional manner, rude to his fellow actors and with 
no concern whatever for a good production of an American classic.

THEATER REVIEWS; CLEAR NIGHT IS IDEAL FOR A 'TEMPEST' IN DANA POINT; THE NEW

<P>
 Many critics judge Shakespeare productions with the wary eyes of safety-code 
inspectors, condemning the whole for each theatrical infraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, Shakespeare's music soars above most imperfections, or he would never 
have survived as the English-speaking world's most popular playwright. Get the 
spirit of the play right, and, like everyone's favorite guest, he is equally at 
home in lavish theaters or playing to picnickers under the stars. 
</P>
<P>
 The South Orange County Community Theatre's fifth annual Shakespeare by the 
Sea production, "The Tempest," gets the spirit right. Add to this the show's 
breathtaking setting of Lantern Bay Park overlooking Dana Point Harbor and you 
have an exquisite evening. 
</P>
<P>
 While much of the county was roasting last Saturday, a cool ocean breeze made 
100-plus patrons sigh comfortably as they sipped their champagne or Diet Cokes. 
Well-behaved children stretched out on blankets next to their parents on lawn 
chairs, some playing Game Boys until the show began. 
</P>
<P>
 The beauty of the summer sky, particularly the wonder of watching the 
darkening sky unfurl its stars, works well with "The Tempest," which is 
essentially a story about magic as well as good versus evil, true love, 
jealousy and forgiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 While the plot of "The Lion King" has frequently been compared with that of 
"Hamlet," its happy conclusion owes more to "The Tempest," a story about a 
duke, Prospero, whose duplicitous brother, Antonio, masterminds a coup d'etat 
that gets Prospero exiled to an island with his infant daughter, Miranda. 
</P>
<P>
 Prospero, once wiser than he was worldly, determines to regain his rightful 
place as Miranda grows into a beautiful young woman. The play begins when he 
uses his magic to create a tempest that tosses boats carrying his brother and 
others who helped plot his ouster as well as a variety of courtiers. When the 
boats crash on his shore, he enlists his magical sprite, Ariel, to help him set 
all relationships right. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Tom Scott gets off to a rocky start by staging the tempest-tossed 
crews off stage as Prospero and Miranda gaze over the railing at the ocean. Not 
only was the water comically serene as they exclaimed over the fierce storm, 
but the failure to show the shipwrecked crew blew an important opportunity for 
establishing critical characters. 
</P>
<P>
 After the tempest, however, Scott kicks the play into gear. His choice of 
making Prospero's island the New World of what was to become California, with 
the sprites being Native Americans rather than Greek and Roman nymphs, is an 
inspiration that harmonizes well with the setting. 
</P>
<P>
 The performers, too, play the music of Shakespeare's poetry well. Though B. 
Aaron Cogan is too young and vigorous for Prospero -- a man who has supposedly 
aged into the height of his powers -- he gives an intelligent and passionate 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerene Harlan, who is of Blackfoot heritage, brings a light and Puckish touch 
to Ariel -- radiating a tantalizing whiff of sexual tension between her and her 
master. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kristin More and Thomas A. Roden play the young lovers, Miranda and Ferdinand, 
with simple, sweet grace, while Tim Mull proves an oily, snake-like Antonio. 
Keith David Dillon's intensity brings heft to Caliban, the angry spirit who 
fights rather than serves Prospero. 
</P>
<P>
 The physical and verbal adeptness of Bob Snook and Monte Collins provide some 
of the funniest moments as Trinculo and Stephano, the drunk servants who lord 
it over Caliban while their masters are away. 
</P>
<P>
 LouAnne Lopez's choreography enhances the Native American theme. Michelle 
Evans' light design worked well with the moon and the stars, improving as the 
sky darkened. The unobtrusive set design -- a hut, a rock -- by Scott, Bruce 
Mitchell, John Zarbock, Bob Snook, Tim Mull, Chris Butler and George Bolta 
suited the surroundings well. 
</P>
<P>
 It all added up to a "Tempest" that may not be definitive but is definitely 
pleasing -- a gift to the community that succeeds in enhancing the attraction 
of lovely Lantern Bay Park. And that's no small feat. 
</P>

POP MUSIC REVIEW; US3'S HYBRID ENDS UP AS A SAMPLE-FREE JAZZ COMBO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like plain old rap, and unlike jazz, the burgeoning jazz-rap hybrid is more 
intriguing as a studio product than as a live entity. Even the genre's top act, 
Us3, didn't make a convincing case for the merger in its show at the House of 
Blues on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 With their improvisational nature, jazz and rap both value spontaneity and 
immediacy, and jazz scatting, with its rhythmic and tonal alacrity, is a 
primary forerunner of the emcee's art. 
</P>
<P>
 This common ground was exploited with dash and style last year on Us3's "Hand 
on the Torch" album, which wedded cool-school raps to a library of samples from 
the famed Blue Note Records catalogue. The juxtaposition of classic old tracks 
and contemporary vocals had a patchwork charm and a stylistic integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 But the live version of the London-based outfit scraps '90s technology and 
embraces tradition. On Tuesday it was essentially a smoking, sample-free jazz 
combo with a tilt toward traditional be-bop, fronted by New York rappers Kobie 
Powell and KBC and London-born Jamaican Tukka Yoot. (Us3's founders and leaders 
Geoff Wilkinson and Mel Simpson aren't a part of the touring enterprise.) 
</P>
<P>
 Like most conventional rap acts, Us3 narrowed its range on stage as it 
emphasized energy at the expense of the content and context of its album. The 
performance had plenty of drive and instrumental flair, but it grew tiresome as 
the rappers were unable to put across much of a message or apply the light 
touch that would allow the rap and the jazz to really mesh. RICHARD CROMELIN

 Tur Wins Suit: A Los Angeles jury has sided with helicopter pilot-reporter Bob 
Tur, ruling Tuesday that he was the victim of malicious prosecution by the Los 
Angeles Fire Department and that its personnel had made false statements about 
him. The lawsuit stemmed from a 1991 incident in which the fire department 
alleged that Tur, while shooting for KCOP-TV, had endangered the lives of those 
involved in the rescue of a fisherman on the rocks off San Pedro. As a result 
of the department's complaint, Tur's pilot certificate was revoked, and he was 
charged with criminal interference. The criminal charges were later dismissed. 
Tuesday's ruling could lead to the certificate being returned to Tur, who, 
accompanied by another pilot, is currently a helicopter reporter for KCBS-TV.

dispute on the set of "Easy Rider," the 1969 counterculture film directed by 
Hopper about a couple of laid-back rebels on a cross-country motorcycle 
odyssey. "We have provided Mr. Hopper and his lawyer with sworn statements by 
three witnesses who said it was the other way around," said Torn's lawyer.

 Live Nirvana Album Planned: A double album of approximately 30 live Nirvana 
songs is tentatively scheduled for an early November release on DGC Records, 
seven months after the April suicide of lead singer Kurt Cobain. The album, 
titled "Verse Chorus Verse," will include the band's entire "MTV Unplugged" 
acoustic special taped in November, 1993, as well as previously unreleased live 
performances from 1989 to 1994. Songs not contained on previous Nirvana albums 
will also be included. The album is being compiled by Nirvana bassist Krist 
Novoselic, drummer Dave Grohl and DGC executive Mark Kates. TELEVISION

 Inside the LAPD: The daily activities of the Los Angeles Police Department 
will be the focus of "L.A.P.D.," a new half-hour syndicated reality show 
planned for next fall. The show, from MGM Television, is billed as "the first 
real inside look at the world's most well-known police organization." Los 
Angeles Police Chief Willie L. Williams called the show "a window through which 
the viewer will be able to see the truth of department activities. The 
observation will give the community at large a far better understanding of the 
realities of police work in Los Angeles."

RECORD REVIEW; A FINE, CONFIDENT DEBUT BY B SHARP

 *** 1/2 ,"B SHARP JAZZ QUARTET" MAMA Foundation  
</P>
<P>
 Black Note may have gotten the big label contract, but the B Sharp Jazz 
Quartet is the best of Los Angeles' young post-bop bands. Its premiere release 
is a confidently written and executed program that sings with promise. 
</P>
<P>
 Though there are many fine solo moments, the disc's 10 cuts find improvisation 
taking a back seat to composed ensemble play, resulting in a strong group 
identity and a sound born of interplay rather than individual interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The quartet's best pieces borrow from Thelonious Monk's quirky rhythms and 
twist off from there, often with a funk flavor. Bassist Reggie Carson's 
"Analytical Cubism" is a prime example, building on the bass's alley-cat strut 
as saxophonist Randall Willis and pianist Eliot Douglass slip and slide around 
its corners. 
</P>
<P>
 Drummer Herb Graham Jr., who contributes the majority of the selections, fuses 
his band mates' sounds with sharp punctuation and strongly woven rhythmic 
textures. 
</P>
<P>
 Saxophonist Willis, though occasionally relying too much on repetition, makes 
for a virile lead voice while pianist Douglass provides calm, thoughtfully 
collected contrast. 
</P>
<P>
 The disc's only borrowed number, John Coltrane's "Naima," is served up in a 
cool, deliberate style that makes for a soothing climax to this fine first 
effort. BILL KOHLHAASE

DETROIT SYMPHONY, JARVI BEGIN FIVE-NIGHT BOWL VISIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beginning a four-program, five-night showcase visit to Hollywood Bowl on 
Tuesday, Neeme Jarvi and his Detroit Symphony delivered an admirably 
unhackneyed program, including an unexpected Bowl premiere: the first Cahuenga 
Pass performance (in 73 summers!) of Dvorak's wonderful Fifth Symphony -- the 
one in F, Opus 76, for those still confused by Dvorak's quirky symphonic 
numbering. 
</P>
<P>
 (As a matter of fact, the Fifth -- according to available records -- also has 
never been played by our own Los Angeles Philharmonic in its eight decades 
downtown.) 
</P>
<P>
 The bucolic, beauteous and openhearted F-major Symphony is worth waiting for, 
of course, and 9,793 listeners at the Bowl greeted it warmly. 
</P>
<P>
 Its many charms restore even a jaded listener's faith in this composer's 
technical skills and melodic gifts. As played gamely by the Michigan 
orchestra's able instrumentalists, led affectionately and with an unflagging 
sense of direction by Jarvi, it exerted those charms consistently, particularly 
in the open meadows of the inner movements. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of this novel program proved equally rejuvenating to experienced 
listeners. It began with a hymn-like walk-through of "The Star-Spangled 
Banner," offered a jolly overture via Rimsky-Korsakov's "Capriccio Espagnol," 
then brought onstage Swedish trumpeter Hakan Hardenberger for showpieces by 
Haydn and Waldteufel. 
</P>
<P>
 Haydn's familiar Trumpet Concerto has been heard in this amphitheater many 
times, but seldom with the finesse, mellowness and easy virtuosity that 
Hardenberger brought to it; he was assisted handsomely by Jarvi & Co. Even more 
mellow was his revival of Waldteufel's delectable bon-bon "Pluies d'Etoiles" 
(Showers of Stars), a "concert polka" few would want to resist; certainly no 
one seemed to be reviling it at this insouciant but showy performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The accomplished, nicely balanced Detroit orchestra, which makes competent and 
serviceable, but seldom resplendent or breathtaking, sounds, proved 
considerably more inspired by Dvorak than by Rimsky. Even so, "Capriccio 
Espagnol" showed the ensemble off well, especially the woodwind soloists and 
concertmaster Emmanuelle Boisvert.

TV REVIEWS; GHOSTS OF '70S NO-BRAINERS HAUNT 'HOODS' AND 'HEAVEN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<P>
 They don't make 'em like this anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "Robin's Hoods" and "Heaven Help Us," two new Aaron Spelling series premiering 
in syndication tonight, both play like perfect "SCTV"-style parodies of the 
'70s glory days of high-concept, no-brainer TV fantasy hours. Is it possible 
these could indeed be the failed pilot scripts of 15 years ago, pulled out of 
mothballs to fill the pipeline? All that's missing are the sideburns and 
jiggling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Robin's Hoods" arrives with an almost deliriously silly premise: An assistant 
district attorney, Brett Robin (Linda Purl, too good for this), inherits her 
late husband's nightclub, which she finds is improbably staffed by four 
fabulous babes and one hunka hunka burnin' Diet Coke. What do the five 
absolutely comely barkeeps have in common, besides looking like refugees from 
"Models Inc."? Why, they're all ex-cons -- whose mug shots, hilariously, look 
right out of a portfolio -- and, having been hired as part of a parole 
diversion program, they all just want a chance . 
</P>
<P>
 Will the con-hating district attorney and club owner get past her 
one-strike-and-yer-out bias and keep the reformed kids on, or kick 'em back 
into the pen? In tonight's premiere, all five "hoods" help Mrs. Robin solve the 
mystery of her husband's recent murder -- ensuring that the four gals, at 
least, will continue modeling swell halters instead of those nasty, 
midriff-covering prison blues. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, yes: Country star Collin Raye pops up at the club, right about the time 
you're expecting B. J. Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heaven Help Us" is no slouch in the jaw-dropper department either. John 
Schneider and Melinda Clarke co-star as newlyweds whose two-seater plane 
crashes into a high-rise as they attempt mile-high lovemaking mere minutes 
after marrying. Short series, you think, but after the first commercial, the 
couple is still around; now Schneider is the Duke of Valhalla, and Clarke is 
the ghostess with the mostess -- easy-on-the-eyes phantoms too good-looking to 
be made quite immaterial. 
</P>
<P>
 Their angelic guide through the afterlife is Ricardo Montalban, who seems to 
relish teasing them about their purgatorial status: "There is an up place, 
there is a down place"; the couple's direction will depend on how well they 
help people. Spiritist jests abound as the newly-deads intervene to save the 
marriage of Clarke's parents and earn their wings. "Time flies when you're 
having eternity!" quips Montalban, speaking for few of us. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Heaven Help Us" premieres at 8 tonight, followed by "Robin's Hoods" at 9 on 
KCOP-TV Channel 13.

JAZZ REVIEW; ALLISON PROVES HE HASN'T LOST THAT YOUTHFUL SPARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the initial song on his new album, 66-year-old Mose Allison describes 
himself as a "certified senior citizen." But the Mississippi-born pianist and 
songwriter has always chosen to view the world through a somewhat whimsical 
prism. Snowy white beard and shiny pate to the contrary, Allison played an 
opening-night set at Catalina Bar & Grill on Tuesday that was as energetically 
youthful as anything he's ever done. 
</P>
<P>
 Wasting no time with idle pleasantries, Allison kicked off his program with a 
multisegmented instrumental work -- a wild, unexpected ride across a musical 
landscape ranging from Kurt Weill and Cajun to be-bop and free jazz. It was a 
startling entrance for a performer so associated with laid-back, jazz and 
blues-tinged vocalizing, and one that had bassist Eric von Essen and drummer 
Paul Kreibich hanging on for dear life. 
</P>
<P>
 But Allison soon dipped into his seemingly inexhaustible supply of songs. 
Characteristically, he made everything, original and otherwise, his own. Witty 
renditions of Willie Dixon's classic line "I Live the Life I Love, and I Love 
the Life I Lead" and the Nat Cole swinger "Meet Me at No Special Place" were 
juxtaposed against harmonically evocative versions of "Indian Summer" and "You 
Are My Sunshine." 
</P>
<P>
 Allison added a few of his original tunes, including several from the new 
album, "The Earth Wants You." But for the most part, he appeared to be 
concerned with a far-reaching eclecticism rather than a rehash of the past. In 
fact, the best description of his feisty and persistently varied performance 
may come from Allison's own lyrics: "I'm a certified senior citizen. . . . just 
don't give me that ol'-timer crap." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Mose Allison Trio at Catalina Bar & Grill, 1640 N. Cahuenga Blvd., 
Hollywood. (213) 466-2210. $12 cover tonight and Sunday; $15 cover 
Friday-Saturday; two-drink minimum. Allison plays two sets each night, 8:30 and 
10:30, through Sunday.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; DOWNSET'S PASSIONS RING TRUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Downset offers a thinking and passionate flip side to numb-headed hard-core or 
muscle-flexing metal. The San Fernando Valley quintet mixes rap with the two 
styles in the tradition of Anthrax, then adds a social conscience via Rey 
Anthony Oropeza's lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 Oropeza's passion rang true at the Troubadour on Monday, while the band's 
menacing, dense music moved his furious messages. Downset is the street's 
answer to Rage Against the Machine. 
</P>
<P>
 The stocky singer (he bills himself as "messenger") rapped about apathy 
against violence, wailed anti-rape sentiments and chanted lines about racism: 
"You were raised to hate me, I was raised to hate you." Between songs, the 
former gang member attacked the glorification of the gang lifestyle: "If you 
want to fall at the feet of that false god, I'm not with you." 
</P>
<P>
 The band's heavy-duty rock wasn't quite as tight as on its new debut album but 
was energized nonetheless. The band played double-guitar, groove-heavy, 
grinding tunes that at times were too similar to one another, but grew tighter 
as the set progressed. LORRAINE ALI

ART REVIEWS; 'TRANSTEXTUALISM': WORKS TO READ, SEE, FEEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID PAGEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If they could, the paintings, sculptures, drawings and photographs in 
"Transtextualism" would reach out and touch you on the tips of your fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 Being inanimate objects, however, the works in this jumbled exhibition at Mark 
Moore Gallery, organized by artist Sabina Ott, do the next best thing: They 
attempt to get viewers to physically engage them, to run hands, fingers or eyes 
across their variously textured surfaces. 
</P>
<P>
 The most captivating pieces in the uneven, 21-artist show instill some tension 
between seeing and touching. The least interesting works settle for studying 
nit-picking differences between looking and reading. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the former category is the show's most massive object, a pile of rocks 
unceremoniously stacked in the middle of the gallery. About half of the hefty 
stones in Wendy Adest's "Lair" have been carefully wrapped with silky fabric 
printed with a leopard-skin pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 To the eye, Adest's sculpture looks like a pile of rough rocks interspersed 
with soft, chiffon-covered cushions. Only upon squeezing the artist's 
fraudulent pillows do you discover how uncomfortable they are. 
</P>
<P>
 A hands-on, curious and untrusting approach reveals "Lair" to be a liar. 
Adest's deceptive sculpture registers a decisive gap between the ways one's 
eyes and hands function. 
</P>
<P>
 Buzz Spector's dismembered and reconfigured books evince an even more 
pronounced fusion of violence and beauty. Torn to shreds and meticulously glued 
back together, his dysfunctional texts are not readable. As you silently 
sound-out their nonsensical articulations, you have to listen to them in your 
inner ear. 
</P>
<P>
 They show that language is not a disembodied abstraction, but a substantial, 
physical entity. Like a babbling cacophony of randomly arranged vowels and 
consonants, Spector's ripped pages give form to the multilayered texture of 
language, to guttural utterances, delicate intonations and monosyllabic 
ejaculations. 
</P>
<P>
 Sally Elesby's slight, wiry confections; Christopher French's abstract 
painting on pages of Braille; Vernon Fisher's damaged photographs and Nicolas 
Rule's drippy, runny picture of a thoroughbred's lineage similarly give shape 
to charged differences between visual and tactile experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Berens' "Attempt to Make My Statement From 1977 More Closely Reflect 
My Work From That Period" is a hilarious attempt to conflate looking and 
reading. By juxtaposing a blurry photograph of a landscape with a typed 
artist's statement whose words have been shifted to imitate the photo's tonal 
modulations, Berens demonstrates that images and words serve different 
purposes. His clever diptych reveals the absurdity of trying to get language to 
function pictorially. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly all of the other pieces in the exhibition treat language abstractly, as 
an intangible structure to be read from a distance, or as a static element to 
be redesigned visually. As a result, the texts employed by these works lack 
texture. Viewers are left with little to read, less to see and still less to 
feel. Aside from a handful of satisfying exceptions, "Transtextualism" doesn't 
offer much to grab onto, either physically or conceptually.

<P>
 Objects of Reverie: Alison Van Pelt's oils-on-canvas at Robert Berman Gallery 
try to transfer the mystique of old photographs to nearly life-size painted 
portraits. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the L.A.-based artist's ghostly images of solitary, nude women 
shrouded in indistinct, atmospheric blurs look sexy. Specific details disappear 
into the shadows, leaving viewers free to fantasize about the mysterious women 
Van Pelt conjures with her paintbrush. Their lithe bodies and incandescent skin 
seem to be bathed in the warm glow of flickering candle light. 
</P>
<P>
 After the superficial allure of Van Pelt's pictures wears off, they begin to 
resemble painstakingly rendered yet opportunistic imitations of Gerhard 
Richter's chilling paintings of murdered student nurses from the 1960s, 
portraits of German intellectuals from the 1970s, and haunting suite of images 
from the 1980s, depicting the members of the Baader-Meinhof gang who met 
mysterious deaths in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to Richter, whose figurative works draw their often tragic 
subjects from social events while poignantly reflecting upon public memory and 
amnesia, Van Pelt chooses to depict typically attractive, imaginary women as 
objects of private reverie. This strategy echoes that of conventional 
pornography. 
</P>
<P>
 Her work lacks the resonance of Richter's elegiac paintings. Close inspection 
reveals that Van Pelt's surfaces are slap-dash and thin in contrast to 
Richter's lush, gradually built-up layers of paint, which facilitate a wider 
range of tonal variations. Making paintings that resemble paintings that 
resemble photographs fails to turn the tables in Van Pelt's favor, instead 
diminishing the power of her technically proficient but unimaginative art.

 If you're ever in Seoul, Korea, take the No. 2 subway to Samsong Station. From 
there, walk two minutes to the Korea Trade Center Building.Then descend to the 
underground arcade. What's there? The Myongga Kimchi Museum, devoted to Korea's 
famous pickles.  
</P>
<P>
 There are at least 100 kinds of kimchi in Korea, and eight of them are 
pictured in "Korea: A Journey to Exotic Tastes," published by the Korea 
National Tourism Corp. This dining-out guide is intended for use overseas, but 
it would also be handy in Los Angeles's Koreatown (though we have yet to find a 
local restaurant specializing in stewed togani , the cartilage and surrounding 
meat of a beef knucklebone, which the guidebook describes as having a 
delectable texture; "fully boiled, it makes a surprisingly delicate and 
non-fatty addition to the thick, richly flavored broth of this hotpot"). A menu 
guide, photographs of ingredients, a Korean-English glossary of dishes and tips 
on table manners are some of the features. For a free copy, contact the tourism 
corporation at (213) 382-3435. BARBARA HANSEN

 What would be a good long-term solution to the problem of storing perishable 
foods -- meat, dairy products, fruits and vegetables? You could just stick it 
in the Canadian Arctic. Megatons of food could be stored there for as long as 
23 years with no preservative but the -10o to -65o temperatures. Ben Berck, 
chairman of Manitoba Environmental Research Council, made this faintly 
science-fictional proposal quite seriously at the 208th national meeting of the 
American Chemical Society in Washington on Aug. 22. Stoli on Ice

 Russian bankruptcy officials confirmed Aug. 16 that the Kristall joint-stock 
company, maker of Stolichnaya and two dozen other brands of vodka, has been 
declared insolvent. Used to operating at a loss, like many inefficient 
state-run enterprises from the Soviet days, Kristall has had trouble facing 
foreign competition. More expensive imported vodkas tend to have more prestige 
than top domestic brands, and vodkas from Finland, Germany, Poland, the Ukraine 
and Belarus often cost even less than the cheapest Russian vodkas. The Russian 
government says it plans to work with managers to restructure the debt-ridden 
company. (One reason the government is so eager to cooperate: It owns 51% of 
Kristall's stock. Another: Vodka -- which is taxed at the 90% level -- provides 
about 10% of the government's revenues.) CHARLES PERRY

 Just a short note to thank you for your sensible and well-balanced approach to 
the issues you cover in your columns. You have given me much confidence as I 
got about my business in the kitchen.

 Certainly the balsamic vinegar you suggest in today's column (In the Kitchen, 
Aug. 4) is a good idea (I've been using it for the last year) but the simplest 
version of a broiled tomato (which is not exactly stuffed) using olive oil, 
balsamic vinegar, pepper, kosher salt, Greek oregano and Parmesan, produces a 
result that goes far in my house, where some won't eat anchovies.

SALAD; UNFASHIONABLE DRESSINGS: WHICH THOUSAND ISLANDS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS PARSONS, TIMES FOOD MANAGING EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When was the last time you walked into a fancy foodie restaurant, ordered a 
salad and were asked which dressing you wanted? A national tradition may be 
dying. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside of burger huts and steak houses, the salad world today is ruled by 
mesclun mixes and light vinaigrettes. So, before the colors fade, let's pause a 
moment and contemplate the pantheon of American dressings -- Thousand Island, 
Russian, green goddess -- in all of their pink, orange and green glory. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early part of this century, these fanciful concoctions were the epitome 
of swell. But those were different days and different salads. Salads then were 
the height of elegance, the inventions of master chefs who were as proud of 
their inventions as any designer of haute pizzas. 
</P>
<P>
 If that sounds funny, remember that these dressings were intended not for 
bowls of mixed greens, but for salades composees , elaborate constructions of 
cold fish, vegetables, meat and fruit, the workaday descendants of which we 
know today as egg, potato, chicken and tuna salads. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1923 pamphlet "Fancy Salads of the Big Hotels," published by the Hotel 
Industry press, you can find everything from the decent-sounding tomato a la 
Maryland (a tomato stuffed with crab meat dressed with Thousand Island) to 
pommes Medici (a hollowed-out apple stuffed with pineapple, celery and 
maraschino cherries and dressed with mayonnaise and whipped cream). 
</P>
<P>
 "The fish and meat salads, with the heavier Mayonnaise, are suitable for 
luncheon, supper, high tea and those Bohemian feasts which begin at the mystic 
hour of midnight," wrote Olive Green in her 1909 cookbook "One Thousand 
Salads." "As the pie ce de resistance of a reception or wedding supper, or even 
at the home dinner table in summer, where no other meat is served, the fish or 
meat salad with Mayonnaise holds an honored and proper place." 
</P>
<P>
 Lettuce salads were certainly known, but how popular they were is difficult to 
say. Almost every cookbook of record included instructions -- sometimes quite 
elaborate -- on how to prepare a green salad. On the other hand, if salads were 
truly commonplace, you wouldn't think that much advice would be necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there is some evidence of a cultural aversion to green salads among 
certain groups. One anecdote has the chancellor of Harvard University, on 
seeing a green salad, thundering: "You serve me a plate of weeds? What am I, 
one of Nebuchadnezzar's asses?" (Diners who remember the early days of mizuna 
may sympathize.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the attitude toward green salads themselves, there was a unanimous 
opinion as to their dressing. "Under no circumstances add anything to the 
dressing other than oil, vinegar, pepper and salt," wrote Thomas Murrey in his 
1884 cookbook, "Murrey's Salads and Sauces." 
</P>
<P>
 And he wasn't talking about just any oil and vinegar, either. In a lengthy 
discussion that would do credit to any 1990s foodie, Murrey comes down squarely 
in favor of virgin olive oil and tarragon vinegar. What's more, he advises the 
addition of herbs and wild flowers to the salad itself. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1800s, there was also a craze for salad dressings made without 
oil. These "boiled" dressings were made partly for dietary reasons, but also 
because good oil -- not oil from the right part of Tuscany, but merely oil that 
was not rancid -- was rare in an era of limited transportation and 
refrigeration. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 'boiled dressings' are not salad dressings," wrote Green, who nonetheless 
included more than 50 recipes for them in her book. "Contrary to a notion 
widely prevalent in the rural districts, salads cannot be made without oil." A 
typical Green boiled dressing calls for thickening water with cornstarch and 
mixing it with mustard, sugar, salt and vinegar. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this fad was bound to fade. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I first conceived of writing a book on salads in 1870," wrote Murrey, "one of 
the principal reasons being that I could not only prepare a very good simple 
salad, but could also make sixty-three different compounds without using oil, 
and called by me at that time salad-dressings. 
</P>
<P>
 "A reporter learned of my hobby, and after interviewing me wrote a column 
article on the subject which had the effect of increasing the value of the 
collection -- in my eyes -- 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 "But something was wrong; and it took me some time to realize the fact that 
complaints of dyspepsia were universal after partaking of one of Murrey's 
salads, prepared without oil to satisfy the whims of a few who had tasted bad 
oil at one time and imagined all oil to be bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my despair I added pepsin (an extract from the stomachs of calves and pigs 
that was believed to be a digestive aid) to the dressing. This worked for a 
while, but by degrees I began adding a little oil to these mixtures, and, 
although young, I soon saw the absurdity of preparing a salad without oil. I 
burned the valuable collection and adopted this motto: No oil, no salad." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, traces of boiled dressing remain. When you taste sweetness in 
mayonnaise, or when you're served a white paste called salad dressing, what 
you've got is one of its descendants. 
</P>
<P>
 The simple dressing of oil and vinegar used to be called French. An attempt to 
track the history of that pasty pink stuff that parades as French today turned 
up not a trace, though it could be related to something called "tomato soup 
French" that began to appear in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 Other dressings are better documented. A search for the original Thousand 
Island turned up recipes dating back to 1916. It was apparently invented by a 
Belgian chef (one source has his name as Rheums, another has it as Theo Rooms; 
a call to the Drake turned up a turn-of-the-century chef named V.O. Rooms) at 
the Blackstone hotel in Chicago. There, it was called, appropriately enough, 
the Blackstone dressing. When Rooms switched to the Drake Hotel, he took the 
dressing with him, though he found it politic to change its name. Thousand 
Island refers to the abundance of chopped garnishes that are folded into the 
base -- a mayonnaise spiked with chili sauce and lightened with whipped cream. 
</P>
<P>
 It was fairly close to the slightly later Russian dressing, with which it is 
still frequently confused. A look at the ingredient list shows the 
similarities: Thousand Island is mayonnaise, chopped sweet red and green 
peppers, onion, chili sauce and chopped hard-boiled egg. Russian has 
mayonnaise, chopped sweet red and green peppers, onion and chili sauce. (What 
is particularly Russian about this is unclear. It could be related to salade a 
la Russe -- a salad of chopped vegetables -- or it could be simply that the 
dressing is red. Though would respectable people really want a Bolshevik 
dressing on their tables?) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Trying a few old recipes, however, revealed more differences than meet the eye 
-- or than one might have guessed from eating modern bottled versions. The 
amount of chili sauce is one (Russian has much more). The nature of the 
mayonnaise base is another. While Thousand Island is based on a light 
(texturally, anyway) combination of mayonnaise and whipped cream, Russian is 
made from mayonnaise extended with olive oil. The first is creamy, faintly pink 
and mild, the other is a more vivid orange-red and pungent. 
</P>
<P>
 The origins of green goddess dressing are as well known as Russian's is 
obscure. It was invented during the 1920s at San Francisco's Palace Hotel in 
honor of the actor George Arliss, who was appearing in British 
critic-turned-dramatist William Archer's play "The Green Goddess." Though other 
versions have been developed, the original is a wholly wonderful thing, tangy 
with anchovies and richly herbal from a combination of parsley, green onions, 
chives and -- most tellingly in a good version -- fresh tarragon. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranch dressing, another popular California-based concoction, came along much 
later. According to Los Angeles food writer Colman Andrews, the combination of 
buttermilk, mayonnaise and dried herbs was invented during the 1950s at a Santa 
Barbara-area resort called Hidden Valley Ranch and became so popular that a 
package of seasonings was developed to send home with guests. Yes, there really 
was a Hidden Valley Ranch, though it was little known to the general public 
until Clorox bought the name in 1972 along with the recipe for the special 
dressing. Today, Hidden Valley Ranch products account for roughly 20% of all 
commercial dressings sold, with ranch providing the bulk of the sales. In fact, 
ranch is probably the only one of these dressings that was used on lettuces 
from the very start. 
</P>
<P>
 The introduction of the refrigerated rail car just after World War I led to 
the popularization of the modern crisphead lettuces such as iceberg, which ship 
well but taste, basically, like stiff water. Perhaps to compensate for the lack 
of flavor, heavier dressings began to move onto green salads by the mid-20s. 
</P>
<P>
 On one hand, it takes a mighty green to stand up to a heavy mayonnaise-based 
dressing. On the other hand, it takes a mighty tasteless green to require one.

SALAD; THE GREENS GODDESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE OCHOA, TIMES FOOD EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The ultimate salad tool of the '60s was the wooden salad bowl, put to best use 
by the Playboy-affected bachelor in his singles apartment with the killer view 
of sailboats, ready to conquer yet another bowl of romaine for the benefit of a 
female audience of one. And with each successive match of man and garlic came 
the inevitable problem -- a lingering unpleasantness in the air, the funk of 
salads past. The bowl had turned rancid. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, the essential tool might be the unromantic-sounding salad-in-a-bag. 
With bag well hidden, the home cook projects the image of a dedicated gardener, 
one with the knowledge and time to grow, oh, five or six varieties of baby 
greens. And yet, salad-in-a-bag is pure convenience food with its own set of 
potential problems -- namely, slimy leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere between the bowl and the bag, many of us learned to make a decent 
salad. Spurred by the revived interest in the books of Elizabeth David and 
M.F.K. Fisher, who spent pages describing the delights of a simple green salad; 
by the obsession with freshness articulated by Chez Panisse's Alice Waters; by 
costly oils and vinegars promoted by merchants eager to find the purest 
products in the most obscure corners of Europe, many cooks came to realize that 
a great green salad should be exactly the sum of its parts. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic formula: Even the freshest greens are ruined by cheap oil, yet the 
priciest oils and vinegars cannot make up for wilted leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not least among the leaders of the greens revolution is Kenter Canyon Farms 
lettuce grower Andrea Crawford, the woman conceivably responsible for the 
current salad-in-a-bag phenomenon. Not only are bagged lettuces now available 
everywhere from discount warehouses to upscale grocery boutiques, the mix of 
greens has gotten more sophisticated, from mostly iceberg and carrot shreds to 
an increasingly diverse assortment of European-wanna-be mixtures of baby 
greens: mesclun. 
</P>
<P>
 When Crawford planted her first bed of lettuce, plastic-wrapped greens were 
the last thing she had on her mind. Even today, though she sells her greens in 
boxes (not bags) at one local supermarket, she's not exactly a fan of the 
packaged stuff -- in her view, loose is best. 
</P>
<P>
 All she really wanted when she first got into the salad business was to find a 
way to make a little money and still have enough time to raise kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was 1981," says Crawford, sitting under a tree on the 16 acres of farmland 
in Agoura Hills where most of her lettuce is grown. "I'd been working at Chez 
Panisse with Alice Waters since about 1976 -- in those days the restaurant was 
much smaller, and everyone did everything. I made salad dressings and soups, I 
waited tables, I helped in the wine room and just sort of became part of the 
family. At the same time, I had a garden with some girlfriends of mine in North 
Berkeley, and it was one of those years when the weather was right, the garden 
was abundant and I had this new baby. I was so happy. It was the same summer 
that Alice was really getting famous -- her first book had come out and she was 
busy entertaining everyone, racing into our garden at the last minute for 
lettuce or whatever to serve so and so from such and such. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "One day, I was sitting in the garden, bouncing Nathan on my knee, and Alice 
came by and said: 'I hope you don't mind that I've been taking so much lettuce 
lately, but I really need some more. Is it OK?' I told her, 'There's way too 
much anyway -- take whatever you need.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Then Waters said something that changed Crawford's life. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know," she told Crawford, "if you have too much, you can bring it to the 
restaurant and we could buy it." 
</P>
<P>
 "It hit me then that this is what I could do to make money," Crawford says. "I 
could have too much every day." 
</P>
<P>
 At first, Crawford thought she might try to supply Waters with all sorts of 
vegetables, not just lettuce. But Berkeley is not a place of open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have a lot of land -- we started off in Alice's back yard -- and 
lettuce was the one thing I could grow a lot of there," Crawford says. "I 
developed a growing technique that was pretty different from anything you'd 
read in a textbook. I knew I was going to pick the lettuce young, that I'd keep 
the soil really rich, that the crops would turn over quickly and that the roots 
weren't going to go very deep. I thought, well, we can really cram this lettuce 
in. Of course, when I ran this past other farmers they said, 'No, you can't do 
that; it will never work.' They thought you needed to have space between the 
plants, which is sort of a traditional approach to farming. I just ignored 
them. I mean, I'd had the experience of crowding lettuce in and eating the 
thinnings. It worked beautifully." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The California baby lettuce movement had begun. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually Crawford acquired a whole half acre, and was able to supply Waters 
with lettuce for not only the formal downstairs restaurant, but also for the 
upstairs cafe and Waters' nearby Cafe Fanny. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was all done by hand," Crawford says. "We double-dug the beds; we made our 
own compost from restaurant garbage. It was a small operation, just me and an 
assistant." 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later, the garden was running smoothly, but there was no way for 
Crawford to expand her business. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know this isn't very businesslike," Crawford says, "but I didn't feel 
comfortable selling my product to any other restaurateur besides Alice. She was 
a close friend and she'd done so much for me by promoting the lettuce. I really 
felt I couldn't maximize my potential in that city without irritating her." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a friend of Crawford's had been after her to try her luck in 
Southern California. He'd even found a back yard in Venice where she could 
start out. 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford finally came down and had a look around. She liked what she saw. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Essentially," Crawford says, "I fell in love with L.A. -- with all the open 
space, with the people we met, and with the incredible potential that exists in 
a town like this. Berkeley just didn't have the same kind of opportunities." 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford's first order of business was to find a place to sell her lettuce. 
She went directly to Los Angeles' most famous chef, Wolfgang Puck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mailed off a letter to Wolfgang basically asking, 'Are you interested in a 
lettuce garden like the one Alice has? And if you are, you have to send me 
$1,000 because I need the seed money to come down.' Up until then, I was living 
the life of a student and didn't have much to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 "Incredibly, Wolfgang called me the day he got the letter. And he sent me 
$1,000 -- he didn't even know me. He was so easy about everything and I felt 
that he was very genuine. We didn't sign a paper; we didn't even shake hands. 
He just said that he would buy every box we had. I told him, 'Well, you know, 
it's going to cost you $50 a box.' He said, 'No problem.' And I'm thinking, 'I 
should have asked for $65.' "

 Crawford left her Berkeley garden in the care of her sister Heidi, who still 
runs the Northern California business. Crawford herself got busy accumulating 
both land and business. She now supplies Southern California farmer's markets, 
restaurants all over the country and one local supermarket chain, Bristol 
Farms. The lettuce is organically grown on land that includes acreage in Baja 
(for winter lettuce), Kenter Canyon Farms in Agoura Hills, and a patch of 
lettuce beds underneath some power lines in Tarzana. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 With success, of course, came competition. "We knew it was a good idea that 
could be easily imitated -- which, in fact, happened," Crawford says. 
</P>
<P>
 Food lovers all over the country were learning that there was more to a green 
salad than iceberg and romaine -- and that a green salad doesn't even have to 
be green. Demand grew quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of experimenting with 100 varieties of exotic greens and charging $30 
per pound for lettuce -- prices that weren't blinked at in the '80s -- Crawford 
now grows a more economical 24 to 30 varieties at one time and her prices go as 
low as $6 per pound. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that I've accomplished my mission," she says. "People are pretty well 
educated -- they know arugula, frisee, radicchio. Baby lettuce is all around. 
But this is a business now."

SALAD; BAG THAT SALAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 No more washing and drying lettuce, no more tearing into bite-sized pieces. 
Now there's salad-in-a-bag -- almost any combination of greens and chicories 
you can think of, from Ready Pac's mostly iceberg All American Mix to Kenter 
Canyon Farm's box of pedigreed baby romaines. Just dump in a bowl, dress and 
devour. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, such convenience has a price tag. Five minutes saved can mean a 
whopping 400% markup. That's what we found in comparing one brand of 
salad-in-a-bag to a do-it-yourself mix consisting of the same lettuce. What's 
more, the quality of those pre-sorted, pre-washed greens was frequently 
disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
 We tested nine brands of bagged salads this week in The Times Test Kitchen, 
sorting the greens according to type, weighing each pile, then re-sorting them 
into good and bad piles (i.e., salad we'd eat and salad we'd throw away). 
</P>
<P>
 We also made our own mixes from lettuce and greens purchased at supermarkets 
where salads-in-a-bag are sold and priced our product against their pre-bagged 
counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We found that less expensive lettuces -- iceberg and/or mature leaf lettuces 
-- make up the bulk of most bagged mixes. Ready Pac's Spring Mix contained 
three ounces of mature leaf lettuce to two ounces of mixed baby lettuces. There 
is rarely more than half an ounce of radicchio in any mix. Ready Pac's Salade 
Lafayette contains 6 1/2 ounces of butter lettuce and one-half ounce of 
radicchio. 
</P>
<P>
 To our surprise, bagged lettuce mixes were often wet -- and, therefore, 
contained some browning and sliminess, even in bags dated for freshness 10 days 
beyond the date we purchased and examined them. Some gave off an unappetizing 
swampy smell. 
</P>
<P>
 Most bags and boxes weighed true, although one four-ounce box of Kenter Canyon 
Farms' baby romaine leaves ($2.99 at Bristol Farms) actually weighed only 2 3/4 
ounces. In fact, after removing a full ounce of unusable leaves, these baby 
romaines cost more than $27 a pound. 
</P>
<P>
 Salad-in-a-bag is an extravagance. Ready Pac's seven-ounce Sonoma Mix ($2.99 
at Bristol Farms, $2.49 at Ralphs) contains 1 1/2 ounces of endive and 5 1/2 
ounces of green leaf lettuce; it cost us 67 cents to make. Preparation time, 
including washing and drying the lettuce and endive, took less than five 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ready Pac's seven-ounce Santa Barbara Salad ($2.99 at Bristol Farms, $1.99 at 
Trader Joe's) contains radicchio, endive and escarole; it cost us 77 cents to 
make. The same company's seven-ounce Salade Lafayette, ($2.99 Bristol Farms, 
$2.49 Ralphs) contains butter lettuce and radicchio and cost us 81 cents to 
make. Fresh Express' 10-ounce European Salad ($2.39 Ralphs) cost us 92 cents to 
make. 
</P>
<P>
 "Health-food" supermarkets are not keen on salad-in-a-bag. Wild Oats in 
Pasadena does not sell any packaged salad greens, and at Mrs. Gooch's in 
Glendale, the only packaged salad found was a box of the standard loose baby 
greens mix (eight ounces for 79 cents), which would have been a bargain if the 
greens hadn't been packed so tightly that more than half were too bruised to 
use. 
</P>
<P>
 To save money, you might try making your own salad-in-a-bag. Buy lettuces for 
the week, then rinse and dry them all at once. Divide whole leaves up into 
individual batches, wrap loosely in paper towels and store in large plastic 
food bags. Tear leaves into the bowl just before serving.

SALAD; ONE VEGETABLE, ONE SALAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bless green salads -- the lettuce, the chicories, the herbs and weeds thrown 
in with them. Despite their dazzling variations, they account for only a 
fraction of the world's salads. 
</P>
<P>
 Every vegetable has a salad . . . or should. (If there's not a rutabaga salad, 
somebody, please, invent one.) 
</P>
<P>
 The rule is simplicity -- take one really good vegetable, give it a light 
dressing and be done with it. The following salads from four continents 
demonstrate how much flavor and complexity you can wring from a minimum of 
ingredients.

 This recipe, inspired by a salad served at the various Mandarin Deli branches

 This is a little different from the usual carrot salad in that the carrots are 
cubed and blanched rather than shredded and raw. The result is a dish that is 
brighter in color and a bit sweeter -- even without the addition of orange 
juice. From Michael Goodwin, Charles Perry and Naomi Wise's "Totally Hot" 
(Dolphin Doubleday: 1986). MOROCCAN CARROT SALAD (Shlada Khizzu) 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 2 teaspoons honey 
</P>
<P>
 1 1/2 tablespoons oil 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon ground cumin

SALAD; LETTUCE: ENJOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE LAND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The salad bowl -- a big, old ironstone washbasin with a wreath of roses around 
the edge -- is full to overflowing with tender lettuces. Some are sweet and 
soft, others crisp and juicy. The colors are a tapestry of bright and dark 
greens, with hints of bronze, ivory and gold. The lightest veil of cream and 
lemon and a sprinkling of snipped chives is enough to dress the whole lot. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to home-grown lettuce, Alice B. Toklas had it right: "The first 
gathering of the garden in May of salads, radishes and herbs made me feel like 
a mother about her baby -- how could anything so beautiful be mine?" 
</P>
<P>
 Look at them sparkling with dew in the morning light: the red-tinged frills of 
Lollo Rossa and emerald ovals of Little Gem, the chartreuse roses of 
old-fashioned Boston Bibb . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Just listen to Angelo Pellegrini. In "The Food Lover's Garden," now deservedly 
a classic, that ardent eater suggests harvesting lettuces when the heads are 
half grown -- of good size and color but still firm and tender with youth. 
"Their very appearance then," he says, "will tempt one to bend to the ground 
and eat them in the manner of a blissful ruminant." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The lettuce list would just about fill the food section if every variety were 
named. There are hundreds, possibly thousands, from heat-tolerant Apollo to 
super-hardy Winter Marvel, but all are members of the same species, Lactuca 
sativa , one of the oldest vegetables in cultivation. Lettuce comes from the 
Latin word for milk ( lac ), because of the milky juice exuded by its leaves 
and stalks when cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Over time three main categories have been developed: L. sativa var. capitata , 
head lettuce (also known as cabbage lettuce, because of its tightly folded 
head); L. sativa var longifolia , romaine (also known as Cos, from the Greek 
island of Kos, its supposed home); and L. sativa var. crispa , leaf lettuce 
(also known as looseleaf, cutting lettuce or cut-and-come, because of its 
relaxed appearance and willingness to keep growing new leaves as fast as the 
outer ones are harvested. 
</P>
<P>
 Mesclun or Misticanza is not a single type of lettuce but a mixture of baby 
leaves, predominantly lettuce but often including cress, endive, dandelion, 
roquette, mustard, chervil and other herbs. Once unknown outside of fancy 
restaurants, mesclun is becoming widely available in produce sections, usually 
sold loose by the pound, sometimes packed in plastic bags. Be sure the leaves 
are whole and sound -- some unscrupulous packers bulk out the mix with cut-up 
material, which shortens shelf life and should not command mesclun's premium 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 There's not much nourishment in lettuce, although the dark-green types do 
provide a bit of Vitamin A. Lettuce is, however, a famous soporific. If you 
demand that food have value beyond flavor, keep in mind the following, from 
"Kettner's Book of the Table" (London, 1877): 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The chemists obtain from the lettuce an inspissated (condensed) juice -- 
called sometimes lactucarium, sometimes lettuce-opium -- which is said to allay 
pain, to slacken the pulse, to reduce animal heat, and to conduce to sleep. 
When Adonis died, it is reported that Venus threw herself on a lettuce-bed to 
lull her grief and cool her desires." 
</P>
<P>
 Growing first-class lettuce is easy and quick. Buying it at the farmers market 
is even easier and quicker. The thing that matters is that the stuff be local. 
Except for iron iceberg and industrial-strength romaine, lettuce is delicate, a 
poor shipper and a poor keeper. Buy it fresh, keep it cold and eat it quickly. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Cream coats salad greens without making them soggy. Use balsamic vinegar if 
the greens have strong flavors, lemon if they're more delicate.  
</P>
<P>
 CREAM DRESSING FOR TENDER GREENS 
</P>
<P>
 1/3 cup whipping cream, preferably not ultrapasteurized 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons lemon juice or 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/8 teaspoon Dijon mustard 
</P>
<P>
 Tiny dash sugar, if using lemon juice 
</P>
<P>
 Beat cream, lemon juice, salt, mustard and sugar in bottom of bowl. Dressing 
will thicken as cream curdles. Add prepared greens and toss well, using fingers 
to avoid bruising leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Makes about 1/2 cup dressing, enough for about 2 quarts of lightly piled 
tender salad greens, 4 to 6 generous servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each 1-tablespoon serving contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 35 calories; 153 mg sodium; 14 mg cholesterol; 4 grams fat; 1 grams 
carbohydrates; trace protein; trace fiber.

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: PARRILLADA PARTY

 Pacific is the grooviest street on the south side of L.A., a mile or so of 
wide boulevard lined with Mexican boutiques, faux gaslights, antique towers and 
pretty two-story buildings, Spanish-language movie theaters and a jillion 
stores selling wedding cakes as elaborate as . . . well, wedding cakes. People 
walk here in Huntington Park as they do hardly anywhere else in the L.A. area, 
stopping at one place for a gordita , at another for a glass of fresh-pressed 
tropical juice, maybe sitting for a while in the sidewalk cafe built around the 
original El Gallo Giro. It's a little like Broadway downtown without the grime; 
a little like a Mexican-American take on Main Street, U.S.A. Polka rhythms 
split the air. 
</P>
<P>
 And toward the bottom of the boulevard, across from El Gallo Giro and just 
down the block from a popular quebradita club (the cowboy-hat vendor just 
outside the dance club seems to do a brisk business on weekend midnights) is El 
Chamizal, the Mexican steakhouse that is the swankiest place in the area, a 
sprawling restaurant with a velvet rope, a million kinds of margaritas and some 
of the best Mexican cooking on the south side. 
</P>
<P>
 On weekends, you get a decent salsa band doing cumbias , charangas and the 
like for the sharp-dressed couples on the dance floor; toward the beginning of 
the week, you get a one-man band slaughtering "Feelings" en espanol . Sit down 
in the front near the music or in back where you can talk, and the parade of 
vendors begins: some children selling chocolate bars for their schools, others 
selling little bundles of Chiclets; mariachi bands eager to serenade you and 
photographers ready to capture the moment for posterity; women selling flowers 
and hats and giant stuffed bears. The beer is cold, the salsa with the chips 
quite hot. Guacamole, mashed tableside in a big stone mortar, is stunning, 
creamy and rich, sharp with the flavor of fresh chiles. Caesar salad, not made 
tableside -- whatever the menu may say -- is a weird, sweet thing that tastes 
mostly like bacon. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic unit of currency at El Chamizal is the parrillada , a squat, iron 
brazier shimmering from the heat of the charcoal within, brought to your table 
piled high with thin grilled steaks, pork chops marinated in chile, hunks of 
chorizo sausage, fried bananas and whole jalapenos burnt black, little ramekins 
of melted cheese and scallions bronzed and wilted to a superb sweetness. The 
meat is terrific, well marinated, rich with crunchy carbonized bits -- rather 
overrich in them if you leave the stuff on the grill too long -- very nice 
folded into a little taco with the house's fine smoked tomato sauce and a 
spoonful of the smoky bacon-stewed beans. 
</P>
<P>
 Half the parrillada combinations include crispy, well-done tripitas (small 
intestines), which may not be to everyone's taste; many include grilled chicken 
breast (OK), the spicy pork stew cochinita pibil (pretty good, if not up to the 
stuff at Yucatecan places) or half a grilled lobster (luxurious, if dry). The 
baby lamb chops, like the swell "burn your fingers" chops they serve in small 
restaurants in Rome, are crisp, spicy and full of juice. 
</P>
<P>
 Something called "steak cazuela ," nearly a pound of thin, sliced steak, 
served in glazed pottery, buried in a tomato-based vegetable stew sharp with 
the flavor of capers, would probably be a special at most places, but here 
seems almost an afterthought. You can get enchiladas here, and you can get 
fried fish, but basically, El Chamizal is a palace of grilled meat. People 
who've ordered sensible stuff like chicken mole or shrimp in garlic sauce sort 
of sniff longingly at the smoking heaps of animal protein that pass by on 
trays.

GARDEN FRESH: MINT, THE UNTAMABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SYLVIA THOMPSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A couple of weeks ago, I picked some peppermint sprigs to add to new peas. To 
keep them fresh on such a hot August day, I stuck the rest in a glass of water. 
I used all but two of the sprigs in the peas and set them, still in their 
glass, behind the kitchen sink next to the window, where I could enjoy their 
dark-green leaves. Every few days I added water to the glass, but otherwise I 
paid it little attention. 
</P>
<P>
 This morning, when I filled the glass again, the sprigs were flowering. They'd 
grown a foot. And sprouted six inches of roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Mint plants are like people who wake up with chirrups and burbles, who whistle 
while they scrub pots and pans, who shake your hand till you wince. Too much of 
a good thing. 
</P>
<P>
 I once brought home a sprig of blue mint. I planted it by the golden sage in 
an out-of-the-way corner. Sage is a member of the mint family and I thought the 
mix of blues, greens and golds would be gorgeous. It was . . . for a time. Then 
the aristocratic mint got bored and wanted our main bed for its playground. 
Twelve years later, I'm still pulling up long blue branches that pierce the air 
with their mintiness, and I'm cursing myself for my naivete. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I've found the only way to level the playing field with mint is to make it 
difficult for the plant to grow. Give mint what it wants -- rich, moist, 
well-drained soil in partial shade -- and you're finished. What I've done is 
put mint in full sun in a few inches of gravely soil over a boulder! It 
prospers and sends out runners that I pinch off and bring indoors for a 
bouquet. 
</P>
<P>
 You probably don't garden over boulders, but you can certainly create a 
shallow bed far far away from other plants. Just be aware that whatever you 
line the patch with -- brick, sheet metal, even concrete -- mint will break 
through it. I've known mint to grow through my mother-in-law's garage wall. And 
don't believe anyone who says you can safely confine it in a big pot or a long 
flue tile sunk in the ground. The roots head for Mother Earth through the 
drainage hole on the bottom, and they're off and running. We're talking 
survival here. 
</P>
<P>
 The surest way to contain mint is in a container. The bigger the better; a 
half-barrel is not too large. Just be sure that whatever's immediately 
underneath it isn't soil. 
</P>
<P>
 Another way to dampen mint's ardor is to harvest often. Although the delicate 
whorls of purple, pink, or creamy flowers are also edible, the leaves will be 
more tender and flavorful if you keep the plant from flowering. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mint is as ardent about adding new members to the family tree as it is about 
reproducing itself. It cross-pollinates with glee. Although there are hundreds 
of mints in the world, only a handful are true mints, mints that you can 
reproduce from seed, and only a few of these are for cooking. Our old friend 
spearmint is the only familiar mint that breeds true. 
</P>
<P>
 Other true mints are less familiar, though no less appealing. Apple mint and 
pineapple mint have fuzzy pebbled leaves. Both hint at fruitiness, and 
pineapple is one of the loveliest of mints, marbled green, white and cream. The 
baby's-tears leaves of Corsican mint don't hint -- their creme de menthe aroma 
is powerfully assertive. Field mint is spearmint-y, and its cultivar, Japanese 
mint, is an important source of menthol in Japan. The pungent flavor of 
horsemint turns up in many mint crosses -- it's a prolific parent. Water mint 
isn't watery but biting, as is its cultivar, crispy curly mint. 
</P>
<P>
 The progeny of these true mints offer not only heavenly flavors for the 
kitchen but charming plants for the garden. For example, citrusy leaves of 
orange bergamot mint are edged in Chinese red. Blue balsam mint is purplish. 
So-called black stem peppermint actually has stems of chocolate-red. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of chocolate, I was doubtful when I ordered chocolate mint, but it 
really does taste like the small, creamy blocks of chocolate known as Russian 
mints. Crinkled-leaf lemon bergamot mint is a delicious blend of lemon and 
mint. Ginger mint is spicy, grapefruit mint is indeed grapefruit-y. 
</P>
<P>
 And this merely scratches the surface of cross-pollinated mints. Curiosity 
about these blends can get the better of you, and suddenly you're a collector. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, most cooks know only the mint that's sold at the market. When it's 
unlabeled, it's either peppermint or spearmint. Both have deep-green oval 
leaves with pointed tips, pinked around the edges and etched with veins. 
</P>
<P>
 It's peppermint if the leaves are on 1/4-inch-long stems; spearmint leaves hug 
the stalk. And once you've seen how rumpled spearmint's leaves are next to 
smooth peppermint's, you'll always know which is which. Peppermint's leaves are 
thin and peppery, spearmint's deep and rich. Kentucky Colonel is considered the 
finest spearmint variety. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mint's assertive qualities must also be tempered in the kitchen. Taste as you 
add leaves -- it's easy to miss the balance point, and suddenly you'll taste 
mint before the food it's meant to grace. 
</P>
<P>
 Mint is for all the year. Spring peas and carrots and roasts of lamb must have 
mint. Summer fruit cups must have mint. Autumn evenings want a sweet finish of 
something chocolate with mint. And when it's miserable in winter, fresh mint 
tea makes everything better. 
</P>
<P>
 When I'm sipping it, I know that tea is the highest and best use of mint 
leaves. In my rare blue funks, I manage to get down to the peppermint patch and 
break off a couple of long sprigs. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I wobble back to the kitchen and put on the kettle. I pull some leaves 
off the stalks and tear a few into bits in my tea mug, the way you're supposed 
to, to release the oils, but I always stuff the rest of the sprigs in whole. I 
pour in boiling water and put on a lid that doesn't match (this is an important 
part of the ritual). After the tea steeps for a few minutes, I stir in brown 
sugar crystals and bring the mug to my desk. I close my eyes and sip. The 
bracing green-gold sweetness always comforts me. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tea is subtlest from fresh leaves, and I can always find a handful, even under 
snow. But if you have none fresh on hand, dried mint reconstitutes handsomely. 
To dry it, hang stalks in a cool, dark dry place for a week until the leaves 
are brittle. Strip leaves from the stalks as whole as possible and pack them in 
jars. Keep in a cool, dark, dry cupboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to our rooted peppermint in the glass of water: If I didn't have a 
mort of mint in the garden, I'd pot up the sprigs. Peppermint is fine for 
growing in a sunny window. Most other mints go dormant in winter and look 
raggedy, but the peppermints hold up in a container. 
</P>
<P>
 You can root market peppermint now or send for a plant. Grow it in a small pot 
until it fills out, then set it in a six- to eight-inch pot in your sunniest 
window. On fine days, put the dear out for a breath of fresh air. In summer, 
plant it, or keep it potted. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, maybe there can never be too much of a good thing. 
</P>

 Fresh mint jelly is honey-colored and extraordinary. A hint of sweet basil -- 
mint's cousin -- gives extra warmth and snap. Don't rinse the leaves unless 
they're gritty. I like the clean, bright taste of spearmint for this jelly, but 
any mint lends a lively, unique flavor.

<P>
 REAL MINT JELLY 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups packed mint leaves and stems, preferably spearmint 
</P>
<P>
 12 small sprigs basil 
</P>
<P>
 3 1/3 cups boiling water 
</P>
<P>
 1 (1 3/4-ounce) package powdered fruit pectin 
</P>
<P>
 4 cups sugar 
</P>
<P>
 3 perfect mint leaves 
</P>
<P>
 With pestle or back of wooden spoon, rub mint and basil in mortar or bowl 
until leaves are crushed and juices flow. Pour over boiling water, cover and 
cool. 
</P>
<P>
 Add mixture to food processor and whirl until finely pureed. Return to bowl 
and steep overnight. Strain, pressing every drop from leaves. Pass juice 
through damp cloth. Do not press or wring. Add water to make 3 cups juice. 
</P>
<P>
 Cover 3 (12-ounce) canning jars, rings and new lids with boiling water. Keep 
hot. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine mint tea and pectin in large kettle. Bring to boil over high heat, 
stirring constantly. Blend in sugar and stir until mixture comes to rolling 
boil that can't be stirred down. Stop stirring and boil hard 2 minutes. Remove 
from heat and skim off foam. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, empty jars and place 1 leaf in each. 
</P>
<P>
 When jelly is ready, immediately pour into jars, leaving 1/4-inch head space. 
Wipe rims, set on lids and screw caps on tightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Set jars in kettle and cover with hot water by 1 inch. Cover, bring to boil 
and boil 5 minutes (add 1 minute for every 1,000 feet above sea level). 
</P>
<P>
 Lift out jars and set away from drafts to cool undisturbed overnight. Next 
morning, check seals. Center of each lid should not wobble when pressed. If it 
does, replace lid with new lid and boil jar as before. Store in cool, dry 
place. Makes 3 (12-ounce) jars.

BACK TO BASICS: MASTERING THE AVOCADO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOAN DRAKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At a Mexicantheme party I attended years ago, every container of guacamole had 
an avocado pit nestled in the center. The hosts assured me that the seed 
prevented the dip from turning dark. 
</P>
<P>
 Not true. It was lemon juice added to the mashed fruit, not the seeds, that 
kept it bright-green. Other facts about avocados: 
</P>
<P>
 * They're available year around. 
</P>
<P>
 * Once picked, if stored at 70 degrees, firm avocados will ripen in three to 
five days. 
</P>
<P>
 * To speed up the ripening process, enclose avocados in a paper bag or place 
in a bowl with other fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 * Slow down ripening by refrigerating avocados whole. Once an avocado is cut, 
the ripening process stops. 
</P>
<P>
 * Avocados should not be frozen -- it ruins their texture. 
</P>
<P>
 * This fruit is best eaten raw; the flesh becomes bitter when heated. Add to 
cooked foods, such as omelets, just before serving. 
</P>
<P>
 There are myriad avocado varieties, but the two most commonly found in markets 
-- Haas and Fuerte -- are grown in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The pebbled skin of the Haas turns from emerald green to black as the fruit 
ripens. This oval-shaped summer variety is available April through November. 
</P>
<P>
 The skin of the pear-shaped Fuerte is smooth, thin and lighter-green. Fuerte 
is the most popular winter variety. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida produces many kinds of avocados, but they're generally lower in fat 
and therefore less rich in flavor. Small seedless fruit, called cocktail 
avocados, can sometimes be found in the spring and summer. 
</P>
<P>
 When using avocados, plan ahead, unless your market carries fruit at various 
stages of ripeness. Firm ripe avocados, which yield to gentle palm pressure, 
are best for slicing and chopping. Very ripe fruit feel soft without pressing 
and are ideal for guacamole. 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare an avocado for serving, cut it lengthwise in half (Step 1), all the 
way around the pit. Then holding the fruit between the palms of your hands, 
gently twist the halves until they separate (Step 2). 
</P>
<P>
 The pit will remain in one of the halves. To keep a cut avocado, spread 
mayonnaise (Step 3) or soft butter over the cut flesh, then wrap in foil or 
plastic wrap and refrigerate. 
</P>
<P>
 To remove the seed, carefully strike it with a sharp knife, embedding the 
blade in the seed. Rotate the knife (Step 4) to loosen the seed, then lift out. 
</P>
<P>
 When an avocado is really ripe, the skin can be pulled off with your fingers 
or the blade of a knife (Step 5). If the flesh is still firm, slice the avocado 
into quarters and cut the skin from each piece. 
</P>
<P>
 The yellowish-green flesh of ripe avocados has a buttery texture. It discolors 
rapidly when exposed to air unless sprinkled with lemon juice (Step 6). 
Avocados have a delicate, nutty flavor and are generally enjoyed as a salad or 
first course. For an attractive presentation, place a prepared avocado half, 
cut-side-down, on a work surface. Beginning at the widest end, slice thinly to 
about 3/4 inch from the narrow end (Step 7). 
</P>
<P>
 By not cutting all the way through, you leave the narrow end to serve as a 
hinge so the fruit can be gently splayed into a fan, with the slices slightly 
overlapping (Step 8). Place on a lettuce leaf, sprinkle with cooked baby shrimp 
and dribble with vinaigrette.

GOOD COOKING: THE WET CHILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABBY MANDEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the dog days of August, take-out and sandwiches are good, but better yet 
are chilled soups that require no cooking at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Southwestern gazpacho with avocado and shrimp, raita-inspired cucumber and 
yogurt soup, cantaloupe and peach soup -- these cool concoctions can be the 
mainstay of a light meal or the refreshing prelude to a more formal summer 
feast. 
</P>
<P>
 Since there's no cooking involved, there's no need to add any fat, so all 
these soups are or can be made low-fat (omit the avocado if you're really 
watching it). Each soup relies on seasonal fresh fruits and vegetables, and 
though freshness and ripeness of ingredients is important, they all also 
contain some shortcuts, such as canned juices, garbanzo beans and chicken 
broth. 
</P>
<P>
 When making pureed soups, I prefer a blender to a food processor because the 
texture comes out much smoother and more appealing. To puree fruits and 
vegetables in the blender, cut them into one-inch chunks and use some of the 
liquid in the recipe. This may necessitate preparing the soup in batches. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since fresh herbs can deteriorate or get lost in the chilling process, add 
them just before serving. And be sure to taste the chilled soup (to adjust the 
seasonings) before it goes on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fresh vegetables give crunchy texture and maximum taste to a spicy tomato 
base; it's a great variation on gazpacho.  
</P>
<P>
 GUADALAJARA GAZPACHO WITH SHRIMP 
</P>
<P>
 1 pound tomatoes, seeded, chopped 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups spicy vegetable juice

 1 1/2 tablespoons lime juice 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup green onions, thinly sliced 
</P>
<P>
 1 medium avocado, diced 1/4 inch 
</P>
<P>

WINE: IT'S A ROSE FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two decades ago, winemakers claimed rose was the wine that went with 
everything. In truth, they made the wine so clumsily and from such poor-quality 
grapes that it went with nothing. Sweetish, off-tasting wine all but killed 
rose's reputation among serious wine drinkers. 
</P>
<P>
 With time, however, grapes and wine-making techniques have improved. In the 
last decade, rose -- some rose, anyway -- has become great wine. 
</P>
<P>
 When made dry or nearly dry, rose has enough flavor to match a huge array of 
foods, so it's excellent when one person orders beef and the other sole. It has 
flavor enough to parry with hors d'oeuvres or after-dinner cheeses. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, it can be made less expensively than most other wines, since it 
needs no expensive oak barrels for aging and is best served young. In fact, the 
younger and fresher, the better. 
</P>

 But rose is still not a wine that sells itself. A spot check of Southern 
California restaurants and wine shops suggests that where the staff recommends 
rose, it's selling well -- "going through the roof," in one wine salesman's 
words. On the other hand, a store owner reports that where customers don't get 
a sales pitch, rose doesn't even rank as a category. Another store owner says 
if he knows customers are adventuresome, he'll recommend a rose, confident that 
they'll come back for more. 
</P>
<P>
 One South Bay restaurant says it has been selling a lot of 1992 Chateau de 
Tigne ($10) -- a rose made by a winery owned by French film star Gerard 
Depardieu -- but only since personnel started pushing the wine. "A few weeks 
after we started talking about it," says the wine buyer, "it's all people would 
order." 
</P>
<P>
 Just five years ago, I would have had a difficult time assembling a dozen 
roses to evaluate. In a recent series of tastings, though, I easily got my 
hands on two dozen. (Admittedly, many are not widely available -- few of the 
wines below are available in supermarkets; fine wine shops are a better bet. 
Some of the wines may even need to be ordered from the winery.) 
</P>
<P>
 One factor that makes many of these wines better than the roses of the past is 
much better grapes. Another is improved technology. In the past, many roses 
were fermented in concrete vats, where the wines got too hot and developed a 
faint orange color and an aroma of wet cardboard or paste. Today, virtually 
every major winery has stainless-steel tanks that may be chilled to allow more 
precise fermentation, which retains the fruit of the grape. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 California winemakers have also begun to adopt a French wine-making technique 
called saignee , which consists of drawing off some of the juice from a vat of 
red wine that has just started fermenting, before the grape skins can give 
their color and flavor to the entire tank. Originally, this was a way of 
concentrating a red wine -- say, a Pinot Noir -- and the clear juice that was 
drawn off would be discarded or made into an everyday wine for the employees. 
These days, the juice is removed when it's pink, piped to stainless-steel tanks 
and carefully vinified into a rose, so the winemaker gets two wines from his 
grapes: a concentrated red and a well-made rose. 
</P>
<P>
 This so-called rose de saignee has been used successfully by Jim Clendenin for 
his excellent 1993 Au Bon Climat Vin Gris ($7.50) and by Tony Soter for his 
stunning 1993 Etude Rose of Pinot Noir ($10.50). 
</P>
<P>
 Rose may also be made by the traditional method of blending lighter red wine 
grapes and removing the entire contents from the vat before the skins impart 
much color. One superb example of this technique is 1993 Navarro Vineyards 
"Petites Villages" ($8.50), a wine that is half Grenache with smaller amounts 
of Zinfandel, Pinot Noir and Gamay. 
</P>
<P>
 Navarro winemaker Jim Klein makes his wine darker than most roses, but it is 
not yet red. The wine's strawberry and pepper/spice characteristics make it a 
joy when served chilled, either as an aperitif or with any food. The wine may 
be ordered for $59 for six bottles, including shipping and tax, from (800) 
537-9463. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving in Los Angeles next week will be a delightful new wine from the south 
of France made by the saignee process: 1993 Val Joanis Rose ($7). This 
Syrah-based wine has a deep, flavorful cherry/pepper aroma and crisp, light 
taste. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, a wine called 1993 Vin Gris de Triennes ($8) will be available. 
The wine is a joint venture of two famed Burgundian producers, Jacques Seysses 
of Domaine Dujac and Aubert de Villaine of Domaine de la Romanee-Conti, who 
co-own a 138-acre estate in Provence. This wine will be reviewed separately in 
a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Other roses I love include the superb 1993 Joseph Phelps Vineyards Grenache 
Rose "Vin de Mistral" ($9.50); 1993 Les Jamelles Cinsault ($7); 1993 Bonny Doon 
Vineyards "Vin Gris de Cigare, Pink Wine"; 1993 Sanford Vineyards "Vin Gris" 
($8); Saintsbury "Vincent Vin Gris" ($8); and 1993 Il Podere dell'Olivos "Moana 
Arrossisce" ($10), a Barbera-based wine by Clendenin. 
</P>
<P>
 Also worth trying: a totally dry Spanish rose called 1993 Muga Rose ($7). It 
is made essentially of Grenache grapes (known in Spain as Garnacha). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Berkeley importer/merchant Kermit Lynch has noticed a significant uptick in 
rose sales, especially in his top two French roses. The hottest is 1993 Domaine 
de Fontsainte "Gris de Gris" ($7.50), a Corbieres from Languedoc. Also 
excellent is Lynch's 1993 Chinon Rose from Charles Joguet ($11.50), which is 
all Cabernet Franc. Some Los Angeles-area wine shops and restaurants carry 
Lynch's wines. 
</P>
<P>
 Also interesting, though not as fruity or complex as the preceding wines, is 
the non-vintage Mouton-Cadet Rose ($7). 
</P>
<P>
 Rose is best served chilled, but the better ones work well if only slightly 
cool. And if the glass gets too warm and no ice bucket is handy, just toss in a 
couple of ice cubes. 
</P>
<P>
 As for those other roses, I figure the term "blush" refers to the 
embarrassment winemakers feel when they make these insipid, sweetish wines 
whose main virtue is wetness.

 1991 Corbett Canyon Vineyards Cabernet Sauvignon "Reserve," Napa Valley ($8) 
-- Blending grapes from different vineyards into a single, harmonious wine is a 
complex and demanding task.To make such a wine in a large quantity and sell it 
for a moderate price is even more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Corbett Canyon, based in San Luis Obispo County, went all over the Napa Valley 
to find the juice to blend for this wine, and did an excellent job. It's very 
dry and flavorful with cherry/herbal notes, a bit like a Bordeaux, but there is 
ample fullness in the finish. The good acidity makes it an excellent match with 
beef dishes. It's often seen at $6.50, or even a bit less. DAN BERGER

PERSONAL BEST: A CLOSE-UP LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO MATTER; ACTIVIST IS ON THE LOOKOUT 
FOR LOST YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Alex didn't like Augie when they met two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't really want to hang out with him," said 14-year-old Alex Colmenares 
of San Fernando. "I liked to be out on the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 But Augie Maldonado understood. "I think he didn't trust me," said the 
53-year-old activist. 
</P>
<P>
 Maldonado of Pacoima is the founder of a group called Salud, which tries to 
help youths resist the lure of the streets and save them from the demons of 
drugs and alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex was among a group of youths who would hang out on Kewen Street in San 
Fernando. Maldonado, working nearby, often invited them to join him for a cold 
drink or a snack. 
</P>
<P>
 Maldonado finally won over Alex when the boy's mother was hospitalized and 
Alex and his brother stayed with him for three days. The boy no longer has the 
same street friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I know they're not my friends," said Alex, now a member of a Salud youth 
club. "They're troublemakers." 
</P>
<P>
 Maldonado started Salud out of his garage in 1986 as a recovery program for 
addicts. Now Salud also sponsors a boxing and fitness program for youths at Los 
Feliz Park and the Starting at Home Youth Club, to which Alex belongs. 
</P>
<P>
 Youngsters in the club, open to those age 8 to 18, plan their own events, from 
volleyball games and pizza parties to trips to Disneyland and Knott's Berry 
Farm. Most of the members met Maldonado through family, friends or a local 
church. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's our boss and our friend," said Linda Fries, a 15-year-old from Sylmar 
and one of the club's leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why he can work with kids so well, because he can be one of us," said 
Elizabeth Corrall, 14, of San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are working with kids, one of the biggies is to keep your word, your 
commitment. And, you'd better be there for them," said Maldonado, who in 1992 
worked for a year with Los Angeles County's Friday Night Live youth program. He 
left the county program to devote more time to the youth of the northeast San 
Fernando Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 Maldonado's close ties to the community have become one of his most useful 
tools in getting across his message. When kids ask him about drugs, he will 
tell them, "Go ask your parents. They'll tell you what I was like. That I was a 
nice guy, but a drug addict." 
</P>
<P>
 A heroin addict who off and on lived 17 years of his life in prison for 
drug-related convictions, Maldonado has been clean for more than 10 years. He 
left Pacoima to get away from drugs, but returned later to find the community 
in the midst of a crack epidemic. So he formed Salud, which means "health" in 
Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, Maldonado joined with other local activists to fight the crack 
epidemic that had turned Pacoima into what he called a "war zone." Despite 
heavy police presence, drug-dealing went on even within a few feet of busts, 
Maldonado said. 
</P>
<P>
 Community members believed that the main problem was the proliferation of 
liquor stores, which had become meeting spots for dealers, users and 
prostitutes. The activists held marches and anti-drug rallies and finally 
succeeded in persuading the city to impose conditions on the liquor stores to 
discourage loitering. 
</P>
<P>
 They also were successful in bringing about a crackdown on liquor sales to 
minors. And the community turned around. 
</P>
<P>
 Maldonado and other community members also have campaigned against forms of 
liquor advertising including billboards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're after the same clients," said Maldonado. "For them, it represents a 
dollar. For us, it represents lives." 
</P>
<P>
 So Maldonado's battle to reach youths continues -- one at a time.  
</P>
<P>
 But like other nonprofit groups, Salud is seeking sources of funding. In May, 
the organization received $72,000 from the San Fernando Valley Partnership. But 
that money will run out in January, Maldonado said.

 The sign above Velocity's doorway merely hints at how demented -- and we mean 
this in the nicest way -- this weekly, all-ages punk club really is. 
</P>
<P>
 Located in suburbia along the outskirts of industrialized Torrance, the 
warehouse/rehearsal space that houses Velocity each Friday becomes one giant, 
twisted aggro scene, resulting in the ideal punk-rock club. Combining plenty of 
angry kids, aggressive live performances and near-intolerable heat (management 
plans to fix the air-conditioning), Velocity uses all the right ingredients to 
create the Southland's most consistently heated mosh pit. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent performance by Glu Gun, whose encore consisted of the lead 
singer dripping a bloody side of beef all over his body, the entire club 
swelled up into one big raging pit. One amusing result was that numerous, erect 
Mohawk hairdos wilted, soon resembling male pattern baldness 'dos. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even the club's muddy sound system can lower Velocity's sky-high 
testosterone level. On any given Friday, as many folks appear to be entering 
the 400-capacity club as are being dragged out by security guards. True to the 
doorway's sign, members of the security crew -- who are decked out in Hawaiian 
shirts -- literally tossed a Nazi wanna-be off the stage and out the door after 
he'd interrupted a performance by Orange County's China White. Thankfully, 
though, the accompanying cheers were in support of his dismissal.

 MONROVIA: A new fire station is a step closer to reality. The City Council has 
awarded a $37,500 architectural services contract to G. E. Busse of Monrovia 
for plans to transform an industrial office at 2055 S. Myrtle Ave. into a fire 
station.The $430,000 project will ensure that a fire station is within 1 1/2 
miles of every building in the city. The station is expected to open in the 
winter of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 SAN DIMAS: The council approved a permitting process to allow horse-drawn 
carriage rides in San Dimas. The ordinance will go into effect next month. It 
was adopted after a hayride driver in Claremont applied to operate in San Dimas 
and discovered the city had no provisions for such a permit. Another applicant 
hopes to offer buggy rides at the city's farmers market. 
</P>
<P>
 TEMPLE CITY: The City Council has given preliminary approval to a change in 
local law that makes parents or guardians financially responsible for vandalism 
committed by their children in violation of the city's curfew law. The curfew 
law requires unsupervised minors under the age of 18 to be off the streets by 
10 p.m. The council also held a public hearing over whether to create a 
business license tax that would cost each business $100 plus $3 per employee. 
The council is expected to vote on the tax Sept. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 WALNUT: The city received the California Water Awareness Campaign Award for 
outstanding conservation in the area of landscape water management. By 
installing moisture sensors in irrigated areas and opening a 24-hour leak hot 
line, the city cut water use by 100 acre-feet, a 20% reduction, for 1993.

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: IN SEARCH OF THE PERFECT WAVE CLOSE TO HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Before sunscreen, there was zinc oxide; before short boards, there were long 
boards; before pickups, there were Woodies; before the Halibuts, there was Dick 
Dale. 
</P>
<P>
 And through it all, there has been Bruce Brown, documenting the endless 
pursuit of the perfect wave -- first with "Endless Summer" and, 28 years later, 
with "Endless Summer II" -- by and for a couple of generations of surfers. 
</P>
<P>
 And one of those surfers, free-lance writer Ken McAlpine, has been lying in 
wait for the release of "Endless Summer II" and for the opportunity to go in 
search of this county's best waves. When the film came out this summer, 
McAlpine pounced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was looking for a good excuse to have fun," said McAlpine, who spent a day 
surfing the county with some young friends for this week's Centerpiece story. 
"I've surfed most of my life, but this was a chance to do it and get paid for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 It was an idea that McAlpine said he had for some time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The original Bruce Brown movie had a big effect on me years ago, and then I 
saw the sequel and it got me worked up all over again. I couldn't really hit 
the road to do a piece like this, since these days I need to be home changing 
diapers. I thought, 'What the heck, we have some of the best surfing in the 
world in this county. I'll do it here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Not that McAlpine hasn't seen his share of the world. In fact, he got a minor 
taste of what Bruce Brown feasted upon while he was growing up. 
</P>
<P>
 "My family traveled a lot when I was a youngster, and I got the opportunity to 
surf in places like Bali and Australia. My claim to fame is that once in 
Indonesia, I jumped out of a boat and nearly landed on the back of a shark," 
McAlpine said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I've had my head handed to me in some pretty exotic locales." 
</P>
<P>
 While Ventura County surfers do share water rights with bottle-nosed dolphins 
and must contend on rare occasions with a great white shark, conditions tend to 
be somewhat more predictable around these parts, McAlpine said. On the day he 
and his two young friends went surfing, conditions were perhaps a bit too 
predictable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a pretty typical day of surfing, with things getting off to a pretty 
slow start. But then it is rare when you pull up and it is perfect. In truth, 
had I not been doing the story that day, I would probably have pulled up to the 
Point, taken a look around and gone home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm glad I didn't, because in the end we found some good surf." 
</P>
<P>
 McAlpine's hunt for perfect surf took him to virtually all the prime spots in 
the county, but sensitive surfers need not worry that we're going to give away 
their secrets. Because other surf stories have brought death threats to their 
authors, McAlpine made us promise to be discreet, not print a locater map and 
tell Valley surfers to stay home.

THEATER REVIEWS; PLAY PUTS 'HERSTORICAL' SPIN ON THE LIFE OF SHAKESPEARE; IN 
'ANNE HATH A WAY,' PLAYWRIGHT S.A. SIZEMORE SPECULATES THAT THE BARD'S GENIUS 
CAME FROM HIS WIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For centuries, scholars have debated the true authorship of William 
Shakespeare's plays, believing that a low-born and little-educated man couldn't 
possibly have created the likes of "King Lear," "Hamlet" and "The Tempest." 
</P>
<P>
 Playwright S.A. Sizemore has come up with a new theory: that Shakespeare's 
plays were written by his wife. Sizemore's playful speculation has led to "Anne 
Hath a Way," which is making its public debut this weekend at the Plaza Players 
Theater in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Reviewed with the consent of author Sizemore and director Denise Santoyo at a 
preview performance last weekend, the new play is considerable fun, and not 
just for Shakespeare scholars -- though they should be especially amused at the 
notion of Sir Francis Bacon and the Earl of Oxford trying to find out for whom 
their associate Will was fronting. 
</P>
<P>
 The story is told in flashback by Mrs. Shakespeare, Anne Hathaway, on her 
deathbed, confronted by her two daughters and a Dickensian ghost. Will, as 
Sizemore would have it, was a thick-witted, virtually illiterate womanizing 
actor; Hathaway, a writer frustrated that Elizabethan literary circles wouldn't 
take a woman seriously. The solution was obvious, if not immediately so to 
Shakespeare. 
</P>
<P>
 This isn't heavy drama but instead rather resembles a "Saturday Night Live" 
sketch. Unlike the typical "SNL" piece, of course, "Anne Hath a Way" is 
literate, funny and doesn't just drizzle off aimlessly into the next commercial 
break. While the history is more-or-less correct, Sizemore and Santoyo give the 
story a decidedly modern spin. The characters are portrayed in their 20s and 
speak in American accents and occasionally, for comic effect, in late 
20th-Century cliches. 
</P>
<P>
 Santoyo's cast includes some of Ventura County's best actors, notably Hugh 
McManigal as Shakespeare, James Leslie (fresh from the Ojai Shakespeare 
Festival's "Othello" and "Twelfth Night") as actor Richard Burbage, and 
Antoinette Pineau as Anne Hathaway. Becky Stier and KHAY/KVEN reporter Julie 
Schepis appear as Shakespeare's daughters; Jennifer Joseph as the dying Anne; 
Michelle Tubbs as Shakespeare's mistress, and Travis Curtis Greer as Sir 
Francis Bacon. A real find is Jim Minics as the comic Earl of Oxford. 
</P>
<P>
 Pineau and Stier also appeared in recent Ojai Shakespeare Festival 
productions. Like Sizemore and Santoyo, Joseph, Schepis and Tubbs are products 
of the Cal Lutheran University theater department. Details

KALETA TO GET $100,000 SEVERANCE ; PASADENA: CITY ATTORNEY AGREES TO WAIVE HIS 
RIGHT TO SUE IN EXCHANGE FOR RETIREMENT PACKAGE. HE HAD BEEN THE TARGET OF 
GENDER BIAS ACCUSATIONS. 
</P>

<P>
 City Atty. Victor J. Kaleta, who was forced to take early retirement by the 
Pasadena City Council last week, received a retirement package worth more than 
$100,000 in exchange for waiving the right to sue over his departure, according 
to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was more than fair," said Councilman Bill Crowfoot, one of the council 
members who agreed to the package in a two-hour closed-door meeting last 
Wednesday to decide terms of Kaleta's departure. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of funding Kaleta's package, the city also will have to pay for an 
interim city attorney and a search for a full-time replacement. Both actions 
are expected to cost taxpayers an extra $60,000, said city officials 
</P>
<P>
 Council members were expected to complete half that task Wednesday when they 
met to choose a temporary city attorney from one of three private Los Angeles 
municipal law firms. But as of press time no decision had been made. 
</P>
<P>
 A selection committee consisting of Councilmen William E. Thomson Jr., 
Crowfoot and Chris Holden on Saturday interviewed Monrovia City Atty. Michele 
Beal Bagneris of Richards, Watson & Gershon; Mary Redus Gayle of Burke, 
Williams & Sorenson, and Cristina L. Sierra of Adams, Duque & Hazeltine. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaleta, who had come under fire since an investigation in April alleged he 
discriminated against female attorneys in his office, was forced to retire last 
Wednesday after four of seven council members publicly expressed a lack of 
confidence in him. In his resignation speech last week he denied discriminating 
against female lawyers in his office. 
</P>
<P>
 An April 14 report was written by a work-conflict consultant who was hired by 
the city after a female staff member wrote a memo complaining about disparate 
treatment of women. The consultant's investigation found female attorneys in 
the civil branch of the city attorney's office were the victims of 
discrimination when two males were promoted during a 1992 reorganization. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaleta said he promoted the two men to keep them from leaving City Hall, that 
the council had approved his action at the time and that he met 
affirmative-action guidelines for hiring women and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 But his fate was sealed Aug. 12 when Mayor Kathryn Nack, speaking to the 
National Women's Political Caucus, joined Councilmen Isaac Richard, Holden and 
Crowfoot in calling for his departure. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 6 to 1 to approve Kaleta's retirement package with Holden 
dissenting last Wednesday. The settlement terms allow the city attorney to 
leave his office this month but continue on the city's payroll for nearly seven 
more months to March 8, 1995, as a consultant. He will retain the title of city 
attorney to that date. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaleta, 55, will receive a total of $103,964 based on his $110,894 salary for 
this year. The package includes $61,844 in salary, four weeks paid vacation 
worth $8,530 and 12 weeks of sick pay worth $25,390, as well as up to $8,000 of 
help from a job placement service. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the terms of his retirement are reasonable considering his 17 years of 
service in the city attorney's office. "I won't be filing a lawsuit against the 
city. I signed a waiver as part of the understanding," said Kaleta in an 
interview Monday.

OFF-DUTY DEPUTY'S VERSION OF MAN'S SLAYING DISPUTED; CRIME: FAMILY AND 
GIRLFRIEND OF JOHN HUFFMAN HAVE INITIATED AN INDEPENDENT INQUIRY INTO HIS 
SHOOTING DEATH IN A SCUFFLE OUTSIDE A ROWLAND HEIGHTS RESTAURANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In front of John Huffman's casket, amid flowers and pictures of the 
29-year-old man laughing with his father and friends, stands a 14-line poem 
written by his girlfriend, Deena Hughes. Two of the lines read: "You called me 
your Eve, said I was sent from above. So I'll grieve only after I've seen 
justice for you, love." 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes and Huffman's family are disputing official accounts of how Huffman 
died, and the family has hired a Newport Beach attorney to oversee an 
independent investigation into the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman, a car salesman and former championship amateur wrestler from Rowland 
Heights, was shot and killed about 9:30 p.m. during a scuffle with off-duty 
Sheriff's Deputy Thomas Kirsch on Aug. 14 after the two men fought outside 
Whitney's Steak House in Rowland Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman died of a single gunshot wound in the chest 45 minutes after the 
incident. That much is undisputed. 
</P>
<P>
 The official statement, according to Sheriff's Department spokesman Rich 
Erickson is this: Huffman, who was drinking heavily and creating a disturbance, 
challenged Kirsch to a fight while both men were at Whitney's Steak House. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to avoid a confrontation inside the lounge, Kirsch agreed to walk 
outside with Huffman, who, without provocation, knocked the deputy to the 
ground. As the two men struggled, Kirsch reached for his gun and it 
accidentally fired, hitting Huffman once in the chest.  
</P>
<P>
 Huffman's family and friends find much to argue with in that account. Huffman, 
they say, was deeply religious; he cared for his two Rottweilers as if they 
were children and held absolute respect for police officers, the family says. 
</P>
<P>
 They question why Kirsch introduced a deadly weapon into a fistfight with a 
man who apparently did not know his opponent was an officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman never initiated fights, said his sister, Eva Thayer, though he had 
been known to fight from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
 But bartender Johnny Nunez at Bennigan's in La Puente, where Huffman came by 
two or three times a week, said Huffman had been asked on several occasions not 
to come back because, he said, "When there was trouble, (Huffman) was usually 
involved in it." He added that Huffman also stepped in to stop fights. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes, who was with Huffman at Whitney's the night her boyfriend died, said 
he was not drunk that night and was not creating a disturbance. She said that 
they arrived at the dimly lit steakhouse between 7:45 and 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20 minutes after they arrived, Hughes said, a man who identified himself 
as "Tom" sat down on a nearby bar stool, and Huffman struck up a conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom, who was actually Kirsch, it was determined later, said he owned an air 
conditioning business. Hughes said she wasn't paying much attention as the two 
men chatted. "The last thing I thought was that there was going to be a fight," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after, Hughes said she left to get Huffman's pickup from the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 When she pulled up to the front door, she saw Huffman lying face down in a 
pool of blood, with Kirsch standing over him, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives say no witnesses have claimed to have seen the shooting. Kirsch, a 
24-year veteran of the Sheriff's Department who is assigned to the 
arson/explosives detail, has been relieved of duty while department 
investigations are conducted.  
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office is also investigating. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirsch could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy on Huffman was completed last week, but the results have not been 
released. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Lt. R. David Dietrich said Kirsch agreed to step outside with 
Huffman because he was going to identify himself as a sheriff's deputy. 
"(Huffman) didn't give him a chance," Dietrich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman's family questions why Kirsch did not identify himself as a deputy 
inside the bar and why he allegedly told the couple that he owned an air 
conditioning company. Dietrich said it's not unusual for off-duty police 
officers and deputies not to tell other people what they do so they can avoid 
police-related discussions.  
</P>
<P>
 According to court records, Kirsch was sued in 1983 by the family of a 
15-year-old boy who claimed that Kirsch hit the boy on the back of his head 
with his pistol outside a West Covina restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit was settled in December, 1985, when Kirsch and the Sheriff's 
Department agreed to pay the family $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Court records also show that Huffman was arrested in June, 1986, on suspicion 
of being under the influence of cocaine. Huffman was sentenced to one year's 
participation in a diversion program. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Huffman was ticketed by the California Highway Patrol in August, 
1987, on suspicion of driving without a license, driving while his driving 
privilege was suspended or revoked, and driving an unregistered car.

FEW CITIES ADOPTING COUNTY LIBRARY FEE; GOVERNMENT: ONLY TWO OF 16 AREA CITIES 
WITH ENDANGERED BRANCHES HAVE OKD SPECIAL PROPERTY TAX. FACILITIES FACE STAFF 
CUTBACKS, REDUCED HOURS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 West Covina Councilman Michael R. Touhey says he has always been a book lover 
and a tax opponent, so deciding the fate of the local branch of the financially 
troubled Los Angeles County Library system was one of the toughest decisions of 
his council tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 Should he vote to allow the county to increase West Covina homeowners' 
property taxes by $28.50 a year, or see the county further cut back hours and 
services at its local branch? 
</P>
<P>
 Touhey was among the council majority last week who went with the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The library is a fantastic part of this community. But no matter how great 
the cause, a council cannot vote for taxes to support it: That's a decision for 
the people," said Touhey, although the council is not putting the issue to a 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 West Covina is not alone. 
</P>
<P>
 In nine of the 16 San Gabriel Valley cities served by county branches, 
councils have rejected the idea of joining a proposed county district that 
would impose the fee in order to maintain library services, which already have 
been severely cut. 
</P>
<P>
 County supervisors, who tentatively approved the plan last month, will vote 
Aug. 30 whether to create a county library assessment district and impose the 
fee in unincorporated areas. But the fee can be collected in incorporated 
cities only if the municipalities agree to be in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members in Bradbury, Claremont, Diamond Bar, La Puente, Rosemead, 
Temple City and West Covina have voted against joining the district, which 
would restore more than $30 million in state funding cuts that led the county 
to shut 10 branches, lay off 300 employees and reduce hours at many branches to 
two or three days a week. Baldwin Park, in effect, decided against joining the 
district by agreeing to take no action. 
</P>
<P>
 In San Dimas and La Verne, the councils decided to put the issue on the 
November ballot for an advisory vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Countywide, of the 52 cities served by the library system, only 13 cities, 
including Duarte and El Monte, had decided to join the district by Wednesday 
morning; 22 had opted out. Seven more decided to take no action. Still 
wrestling with the idea are 10 cities, including La Canada Flintridge, San 
Gabriel, South El Monte and Walnut. 
</P>
<P>
 County Librarian Sandra Reuben said the fee is the only way this year to 
resuscitate the battered county system because a vote on a parcel tax would 
take too long and would require two-thirds of voters' support. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee would offset county library funding reductions that resulted from 
state lawmakers' decision to balance California's budget by reallocating 
property tax money that had gone to local governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Reuben said branches face more cuts and closures without the fee. "A city 
refusing to be in the district can expect to see a scaling back in library 
hours, new books and staff," she said. "A few closures are likely." 
</P>
<P>
 Reuben said she has enough money to keep libraries open at their current 
levels until Oct. 1. Avoiding further cutbacks would mean that the supervisors 
and councils must act by Tuesday to get the fee on the next property tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
 However, city council members across the valley say they fear political 
fallout from the fee and say state lawmakers are passing the buck on taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two council members who opposed new taxes like this won the last election 
here," said Temple City Mayor Harry Budds. "The people of Temple City's message 
is clear: They don't want taxes." He said people he has spoken to love the 
library but are not willing to dip into their pockets any more, especially in 
difficult economic times. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosemead Mayor Robert Bruesch also blamed state lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state Legislature has appropriated the property taxes used to pay for 
libraries to pay its own bills," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some council members said they were disturbed that they would have no future 
say about fee levels. The district could raise the fees unilaterally, and there 
would be no guarantee that the county library system would keep all branches 
open. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we'd voted for it, it would be out of our hands," said La Puente 
Councilman Louis R. Perez. "If the county closed one of La Puente's (two) 
libraries afterward, it's our heads the people would come for, not county 
officials'." 
</P>
<P>
 But West Covina Councilman Benjamin Wong, who supports the district, said the 
council members have forgotten that libraries are more than lines in a budget. 
"Libraries are where children learn. I want my child, who is in elementary 
school, to continue to be able to use our local library." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials expect supervisors to approve the assessment fee Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Reuben said a bill she backs permitting local governments to set up special 
assessment districts for libraries with the support of a majority of the area's 
voters is awaiting Gov. Pete Wilson's signature.

THEATER REVIEWS; A COMICAL VOYAGE INTO COURTSHIP; CAPABLE CAST OF 'CHAPTER TWO' 
MAKES THE SENTIMENTAL JOURNEY WITHOUT AN EXCESS OF WARM AND FUZZY FEELINGS.

 Neil Simon's "Chapter Two" begins when recent widower George Schneider meets 
newly divorced Jennie Malone. He's a writer; she's an actress. Neither is 
interested in a committed -- or any other -- relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 You've already figured out the ending, so the play's entertainment value stems 
from following the two as they stumble along their way to the inevitable. Or in 
trying to figure out how closely the story parallels the real-life courtship of 
Simon and Marsha Mason. Sweet and frequently amusing, the play continues 
Thursday and Friday nights through Sept. 30 at Ottavio's Banquet Facility in 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 The action shifts back and forth between two Manhattan apartments as the 
audience meets George and his would-be matchmaker brother, Leo; then we visit 
Jennie and her friend, Faye. Leo suggests to his old flame Faye that George and 
Jennie date; Jennie and George both strongly reject the idea. The play would 
end rather abruptly at that point except that George accidentally misdials the 
telephone. High jinks ensue. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who tend to shudder at an excess of warm-and-fuzzy, there's a 
subplot where Faye, whose marriage is lacking excitement, considers an affair. 
What happens there is very funny and only the slightest bit fuzzy. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Martin Horsey nicely coordinates the romantic and farcical elements 
so that the juxtaposition isn't too unsettling, and a consistently capable cast 
helps immeasurably. J. Paul Vincent and Aileen-Marie Scott star as George and 
Jennie, with Bob Pusateri and Judy Weaver providing terrific comic relief as 
Leo and Faye. 
</P>
<P>
 (One slight problem at Friday night's show was Vincent's tendency to mumble 
during expository dialogue, although he was fine elsewhere -- he should 
remember that, despite the intimacy of Ottavio's, the dinner-theater 
demographic tends to approach an age when hearing isn't necessarily all it used 
to be.) 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to update the play -- which was written in the mid-'70s -- are 
inconsistent: George writes his novels on a computer, but he's still paying his 
analyst $50 an hour. Details

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: TEXAS LEGEND BRINGING HARD LUCK SONGS THIS WAY; JERRY JEFF 
WALKER, KNOWN FOR SUCH HITS AS 'MR. BOJANGLES,' WILL PERFORM AT THE VENTURA 
THEATRE. 
</P>

<P>
 Let's go to Luckenbach, Texas, with Waylon and Willie and the boys. This 
successful life we're livin's got us feudin' like the Hatfields and McCoys. 
Between Hank Williams' pain songs, Jerry Jeff's train songs and 'Blue Eyes 
Cryin in the Rain,' out in Luckenbach, Texas, there ain't nobody feelin' no 
pain.  
</P>
<P>
 -- "Luckenbach, Texas (Back to the Basics of Love)" sung by Waylon Jennings 
</P>
<P>
 It's a little far to Luckenbach, so consider yourself lucky: Texas legend 
Jerry Jeff Walker is coming to you. 
</P>
<P>
 Making a rare appearance in these here parts, Walker will perform at Ventura 
Theatre on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt fans of Walker's storytelling style will expect him to perform his 
classics, including "Up Against the Wall Redneck Mothers," "London Homesick 
Blues" and "Mr. Bojangles." 
</P>
<P>
 Although lounge lizards probably associate "Mr. Bojangles" with The Nitty 
Gritty Dirt Band or think it's Sammy Davis Jr.'s signature song, it was penned 
by Walker. Walker is the Leonard Cohen of a gang of long-haired bohemians in 
pointy boots who made Austin, Tex., the headquarters of the progressive wing of 
country music two decades ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Willie Nelson was the only Austin alum who attained national stardom, 
it was Walker who got the whole scene rolling with the 1973 groundbreaking 
album, "Viva Terlingua," recorded live in the dance hall of the tiny Texas hill 
country town of Luckenbach. 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, the airwaves were full of Walker's tunes along with the sappy 
supernatural love song, "Wildfire" by Michael Martin Murphey, and pre-fame 
Vince Gill was singing with Pure Prairie League. 
</P>
<P>
 It was still the age of vinyl records. You could leave the turntable spindle 
arm off a record and it would play relentlessly. I owe my introduction to 
Walker's industrial-strength carousing songs to an old record player and a 
former roommate. That transplanted Texas beauty queen would party all night, 
fall in love, then play Jerry Jeff all day to make herself cry because it felt 
s-o-o-o-o good. 
</P>
<P>
 Walker's appearance with his Gonzo Compadres band will also give fans and the 
uninitiated a chance to hear songs from his 24th album, "Viva Luckenbach!" This 
new live album on the Rykodisc label was recorded in Luckenbach 20 years after 
Walker put the town on the map. 
</P>
<P>
 So dust off your golden oldie LPs. And wax nostalgic about the days when you 
could hold a cardboard album cover and read the liner notes while singing along 
with your favorite renegade country artist, Jerry Jeff Walker, chronicler of 
the Texas outlaw life. 
</P>
<P>
 Darlene O'Connell & the Dixie Flyers, one of the region's hottest country 
concert and club bands, will open the show. People who've seen their previous 
appearances opening for national artists Chet Atkins and John Anderson know the 
Flyers deliver the goods in spades. 
</P>

<P>
 The Aug 17 opening of the Ventura County Fair with Hal Ketchum and Carlene 
Carter didn't stop lots of dance fans from turning out for some midweek live 
music at Camarillo's Crazy Bull. 
</P>
<P>
 They were treated to a late-night jam session when the aforementioned Darlene 
O'Connell sat in with the Rhythm Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Also dropping by the club with O'Connell were her hubby-manager Glenn, Flyer 
member John Styles, K-HAY radio's Charlye Parker and assorted friends. The 
party went on 'til midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you attended K-HAY radio's fund-raiser carwash at Newbury Park High School 
on Aug. 13 and liked the bands, you can find them elsewhere. Sweet Country is 
the house band at Ventura's Starting Gate and plays there every weekend. And 
the Rhythm Rangers are all over the map. 
</P>
<P>
 Aug. 13 marked the final appearance of Diane Lynne and the Stars & Stripes 
band at the Crazy Bull -- or anywhere. Lynne and her bass-player-spouse, Gabe 
Lamog, are moving to Nashville to pursue their dream of getting a recording 
deal. She said you'll probably be seeing the guys in the band regroup and 
continue playing. And people on the mailing list will receive updates. 
</P>
<P>
 After leaving the Bull, I checked out Santa Barbara's line-dance haven, the 
City Line Club. I hung around long enough to sort-of recognize the Tennessee 
Waltz -- as interpreted by the Twangin' Iguanas. That explained why the place 
was dead on a Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it was a short hop to Goleta and the Galleon Room, which was high-energy, 
packed with couples and going strong 'til 1 a.m. closing. You'll soon read more 
about Art Green, the talented, silken-voiced cowboy who was playing. 
</P>

 Cousin's in Simi Valley changes schedules more often than most folks change 
underwear. Now you can enjoy live bands Tuesdays through Saturdays. And dance 
lessons are a great bonus. Drop in tonight and be introduced to clogging with 
Gary Howell from 7 to 8:30 p.m. Then on Sunday from 6:30 to 8 p.m., Pam will 
teach "Tropicana Parking Lot" and "Walkin' Wazzi," two must-know classic line 
dances. Miss Ila still presides at "Two-Steppin' Tuesdays" and Kathy Bailey 
rounds out Wednesdays with West Coast Swing. But forget about dance lessons on 
Fridays or Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week you read that the Frontier Club in Santa Paula has gone to Latino or 
"Norte" music. But country dance die-hard Judy Rodgers reported that she and 
beau David "were still able to polka and West Coast Swing to the banda beat." 
</P>
<P>
 Dance teacher and life-of-the-party Kathy Culley missed the Country Lovers 
Western Dance Club's recent annual picnic. But she had a good reason. She and 
country singer Rick Tucker were recruited to spread the line-dance gospel at a 
local fund-raiser for Gov. Pete Wilson. Among the politicians attending were 
Elton Gallegly, Mike Huffington, Robert Lagomarsino and Cathie Wright. Details

NIGHT LIFE: BONEDADDYS BOAST COSTUMED FUN BY THE TRUNKLOAD; DANCEABLE TUNES, 
WHERE THE BEAT IS KING, ATTRACT LOYAL FANS KNOWN AS 'BONEHEADS.' THE BAND PLAYS 
IN VENTURA ON SATURDAY. 
</P>

<P>
 Bonedaddys. Weird name. Weird band. If one of the members wore a hawg hat, 
like an alumnus of President Bill's favorite school, well, he'd be the normal 
one. The band wears feathers, fezzes, leopard-skin pillbox hats and stranger 
stuff that doesn't even have a name. They also wear dashikis, robes, party 
dresses and that American staple, polyester, in a swirling array of colors loud 
enough to daze a Deadhead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do spend more on instruments than on clothes," said bandleader Mike Tempo 
during a recent phone interview. "But our clothes are becoming a little more 
'90s -- everybody just brings their own stuff. Sometimes when we tour, we'll 
bring a trunk. " 
</P>
<P>
 It's anybody's guess what the Bonedaddys will pull out of their trunk when 
they return to Nicholby's in Ventura on Saturday night -- suit, tie and tutu 
wouldn't be out of the question. But what is for sure is the party energy the 
band will shake loose. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we play, hopefully it's fun and there's a lot of dancing," Tempo said. 
"We feed off the energy of the crowd. If the crowd is hot, then we'll be hot." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonedaddys. Weird name. 
</P>
<P>
 "The name just popped up years ago, and it just sounded appropriate," said 
Tempo. "It's the kind of name you can build a myth around." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bonedaddys has developed a hard-core following (fans are known as 
"Boneheads") and a network of band members who come and go. Much like baseball 
spring training, you often can't tell the Bonedaddys without a score card. 
"There's probably 30 or 40 ex-band members," Tempo said. "We're sort of like an 
extended family, and a lot of times ex-Bonedaddys come back and play with us." 
</P>
<P>
 As of the third week of August, Tempo was on percussion; Kasper Abbo handled 
vocals; Marcus Watkins played guitar; Jay Work, sax; Rick Moors, bass; Roderick 
Njoes, drums, and Gary Johnson, keyboards. 
</P>
<P>
 Their music is nearly as eclectic as their wardrobe. About everything except 
heavy metal can be found in a Bonedaddys' song, where the beat is king. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's 'up-full,' you know," said Tempo, inventing a new word. "It's soulful 
and danceable, and if it has those things, it can be a Bonedaddys' song as long 
as it moves people. Sometimes I like to describe our music as country music, 
except that it comes from a lot of different countries. There's several African 
styles, some samba and some Caribbean stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 They do all sorts of weird covers from Elvis to the Wild Magnolias, each 
becoming suddenly very danceable. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a pretty big repertoire, about 50 songs, something like that," Tempo 
said. "We never make out a set list until we check out the (club) and try to 
get a feel for it. We've never had a planned set list until 20 minutes before 
the show. Plus, we're susceptible to calling audibles on stage, depending on 
the crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 Tempo says the band likes playing at Nicholby's. "We'd like to establish a 
little beachhead up there because we haven't been playing L.A. much lately," 
Tempo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The band is easier to find than their old music. "Well, I guess we just 
haven't found the right record company yet," Tempo said. "The first two albums 
are out of print, and the other two are just hard to find. So, the label scene 
could have been a lot better. We wish the records we've made were more 
accessible." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bonedaddys is currently working with a producer and hopes to record a 
demo. "All we can do is try to make good music and let the chips fall where 
they may," Tempo said. "We have to stay true to ourselves." Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: The Bonedaddys. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Nicholby's, 404 E. Main St., Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Saturday, 9 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * COST: 5 bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 * ETC.: Call 653-2320.

 It may not be your average fair with rides and prizes, but it will help ensure 
your child's good health. It is the 5th annual Kids Care Fair, at which 
children ages 2 months to 4 years can receive free immunizations to protect

<P>
 Children through age 18 can also have a free basic health screening that 
includes blood pressure, vision and hearing tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "The recent increase of tuberculosis cases and prevalence of other preventable 
childhood diseases unfortunately acts as a reminder of the importance of 
immunizing children before the age of 2," said Joan McCandless, project 
director of Kids Care Fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Information on HIV/AIDS, prenatal health care, lead poisoning, eating 
disorders and nutrition will also be available. 
</P>

REWARD OFFERED IN EL MONTE SEX ASSAULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A $10,000 reward has now been offered for information leading to the arrest 
and conviction of a man who has been posing as an immigration officer and 
sexually assaulting Spanish-speaking women in the El Monte area. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the El Monte City Council voted to authorize a $5,000 reward, 
matching one offered earlier in the week by the County Board of Supervisors."We 
need to find this man and get him off the street," Supervisor Gloria Molina 
said in urging the reward. "It angers me that someone would prey on women under 
the color of authority." 
</P>
<P>
 Police say the man has sexually assaulted 20 women, always using the same 
method of operation. He flashes what appears to be a California identification 
card, asks the victim if her husband is home and then asks to see her 
immigration papers, police said. Upon gaining entry to a residence, he sexually 
assaults the women. 
</P>
<P>
 The impostor is described as a white or light-skinned Latino man between the 
ages of 25 and 35. He is between 5 feet, 9 inches and 6 feet tall and weighs 
between 170 and 200 pounds. He is clean-cut and has blond to light-brown hair 
and hazel or blue eyes.

 HACIENDA HEIGHTS: Authorities are asking for the public's help in finding a 
man who raped a 14-year-old girl Aug. 7 as she and her family slept in their 
home in the 1500 block of Galemont Avenue. The rapist entered the house about 
5:30 a.m. through an unlocked bedroom window, held a knife to the teen-ager's 
throat and threatened to kill her if she screamed, sheriff's detectives said. 
The rapist is described as a black male, 5 feet, 7 inches tall. He weighs about 
180 pounds, has a stocky build and has black hair and a goatee. Anyone with 
information is asked to call (818) 858-8765. 
</P>
<P>
 MONTEREY PARK: Police will be looking for drunk drivers at a checkpoint Friday 
night. The checkpoint, which will be at an undisclosed location in the city, is 
part of an ongoing education and enforcement program. The checkpoints, which 
are conducted monthly, have resulted in several arrests, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 PASADENA: A 21-year-old San Diego man was shot to death Sunday in the 200 
block of East Washington Boulevard. The victim, who was shot once with a 
handgun, was found lying in a driveway about 7 p.m. His name was not released. 
Police believe the suspects are members of a Pasadena gang but said the victim 
does not to appear to be a gang member.  
</P>
<P>
 POMONA: A 50-year-old Pomona man was critically injured Monday when a car hit 
him as he crossed the street at Dudley and Elwood streets. Dennis Ray Killebrew 
suffered multiple fractures in both legs, head injuries and internal bleeding 
after he apparently stepped in front of a car driven by a Montclair woman, 
police said. Killebrew was listed in critical condition at Pomona Valley 
Hospital Medical Center. Police did not cite the driver. 
</P>
<P>
 POMONA: Police found the body of a man in the front seat of a car parked at 
Center and Main streets Sunday. There were no signs of injury or violence, said 
police, who believe the unidentified man might have died of a drug overdose. 
</P>
<P>
 POMONA: Two men robbed an 18-year-old ice cream push-cart vendor in the 1000 
block of West Orange Grove Avenue Friday night. Trinidad Sanchez was selling 
ice cream about 6 p.m. when two men approached him, reached into his cart and 
removed a handful of ice cream bars and coins. The men then fled the scene. 
Police arrested Pomona residents Charles Bullard Jr. and Virgus Cole, both 21, 
on suspicion of robbery. Both men were taken to Pomona City Jail, where Bullard 
was held on $35,000 bail. Cole was transported to Los Angeles County Jail and 
was held on $50,000 bail because of an outstanding warrant.

CENTERPIECE: ETERNAL OPTIMISTS; THREE SURFERS LET ENTHUSIASM BE THEIR GUIDE AS 
THEY EMBARK ON AN 'ENDLESS SUMMER' QUEST ON THE COUNTY'S COAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 We are standing at the ocean's edge, the three of us, in a gray post-dawn. The 
smell of salt hangs in the air. A spackle of sleep clings to my eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave's eyes are open wide, head jerking about like a radar antenna. He is 
scanning the horizon for waves, of which there are none. Perhaps this is a bit 
harsh. Occasionally a small wave does lap the ocean's mirror surface. This 
causes Dave to react as if he's just been goosed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, look," he says, finger pointing in the direction of a barely 
discernible hummock. "Right there. It's a little wave, but it's definitely 
ridable." 
</P>
<P>
 Dave's head swivels about and speaks to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better than yesterday, don't you think?" 
</P>
<P>
 Blind optimism is a critical component of surfing. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave is 17 and has been surfing for two years. I am 35 and have been surfing 
for as long as Dave has been alive. I have walked away from dozens of mornings 
like this. Still, Dave's enthusiasm is contagious. Besides, we are on a quest, 
and quests, at least worthy ones, aren't easily stymied. Ours is to search the 
Ventura County coastline for the perfect wave, and discover whatever other 
lessons that search might bring. Sure the surf here at Surfer's Point this 
morning is lousy. But if it was perfect, our quest would be over. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave looks at me with moon eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can we surf here for half an hour?" he asks. GLOBAL SEARCH 
</P>
<P>
 Surfers had no doubt hunted for waves before, but it was Bruce Brown who first 
introduced the concept to the masses nearly 30 years ago in his movie classic 
"Endless Summer." In that film, surfers Robert August and Mike Hynson journeyed 
about the globe, bumbling upon adventure and numbingly perfect surf. When the 
film's last frame flicked from the screen, surfers stumbled from the theater 
possessed. A world of waves, a lifestyle, beckoned. 
</P>
<P>
 Some hardy souls even followed Brown's siren call, risking airline food, 
amoebic dysentery and Napoleonic customs officials to surf remote waves in 
places like Indonesia, South Africa and Fiji. 
</P>
<P>
 Relaying the thrill of Brown's original film to Dave and his friend Gavin, 
also 17, might have been difficult had Brown not recently released his 
long-awaited sequel, "Endless Summer II." In the new movie, surfers Robert 
(Wingnut) Weaver and Pat O'Connell retrace the global wanderings of Brown's 
original adventurers, and throw in some interesting forays of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 As with the original, the film's effect on a surfer is nothing short of 
combustible, akin, say, to having Cindy Crawford model spandex at a fraternity 
meeting. Dave and Gavin had already seen the movie when I proposed an "Endless 
Summer" adventure in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 When I showed up at their house at 5:30 in the morning, they were in the car, 
waiting. We had cause for excitement. California is rife with prime surf spots, 
and Ventura County is no exception. From Rincon Point at the county's northern 
end to County Line at the southern border, the coastline is pummeled with good 
waves. I know this because I have surfed most of them. Plus, I called Bruce 
Brown and asked. 
</P>
<P>
 When I spoke to Brown, he allowed that he currently does virtually all his 
surfing near his Santa Barbara ranch. But he was still familiar with other 
California surf. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty funny," Brown told me. "We'd be traveling, shooting a movie, and 
we'd come home and the surf would be better here." 
</P>
<P>
 We also discussed some of the philosophy behind surfing. I asked Brown what 
surfing would be like if the waves were perfect all the time, if, in essence, 
there was no need for the hunt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It probably wouldn't be much fun," said Brown. "The joy comes when you check 
a place five days in a row and it's lousy, and then you show up on the sixth 
day and all of the sudden it's great. It's like climbing a mountain. If Everest 
was in everybody's back yard, it wouldn't be that big a deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet surfers, Brown included, ardently pursue this ideal. 
</P>
<P>
 "True," said Brown, pausing to chew on the thought. "I suppose all of us are 
always looking for the utopian place." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course there is no utopia. Even in California, the surf isn't perfect all 
the time. Here at Surfer's Point in Ventura, Dave, Gavin and I are learning 
this firsthand. We sit in the water, staring at a gray skyline. Occasionally a 
few waves roll through, distinguished from the surrounding ocean as slight 
wrinkles on an otherwise flush carpet. 
</P>
<P>
 Several long boarders notch some decent rides -- their big boards allowing 
them to catch and ride even the most infinitesimal of waves -- but we are 
riding boards far too short for such small conditions. Recently I have begun to 
consider riding a long board, though I doubt Dave and Gavin share my interest. 
Most 17-year-olds view long boards in the same light as the Beatles, trailer 
homes and teeth that rest by the bedside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Definite long boarding," proclaims Dave when we exited the water after an 
hour of sorry surf. 
</P>
<P>
 "Small and slow," says Gavin. GAUGING THE WAVES 
</P>
<P>
 Good surf is a fickle combination of many factors. There must be waves, of 
course. But tide and wind also play an important role. So do the seasons and 
the direction of the swell -- storms send waves from different directions; how 
a beach is positioned determines whether it will catch waves head on, receive a 
glancing blow or get nothing at all. Rincon Point for instance, which arguably 
has some of the best waves in the world, breaks best during winter north swells 
at mid-tide, and a slight offshore wind can add nice spice to the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Such intangibles lead to no small amount of conjecture on the part of the 
surfer. Thus you might find two salty fellows, monosyllabic under most 
circumstances, suddenly discoursing with the verbal panache of McNeil-Lehrer. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfer No. 1: "Dude." 
</P>
<P>
 Surfer No. 2: "Eh?" 
</P>
<P>
 Surfer No. 1: "There's a storm off the Aleutians, north swell's supposed to 
hit tomorrow morning. It rained last night, so there's a chance of a northeast 
wind. Could be offshore and hollow." 
</P>
<P>
 Surfer No. 2: "Hmmmmm. Tide's low at four in the morning and it's coming up 
fast, negative 0.6 at 7 a.m., then peaking out at four feet around 10. Things 
could mush out late. The sooner we're in the water, the better off we'll be." 
</P>
<P>
 Like most surfers, Dave puts his stock in something far more reliable, namely 
a rumor he heard from someone. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's supposed to be something, at least a two-foot swell on the way," he 
says as we drive north up the old Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 If so, it is late pulling into the gate. Solimar Reef is flat. Ditto for Pitas 
Point, Hobson State Park, Oil Piers and La Conchita Point. We swing back onto 
the 101 and two minutes later take the Bates Road turnoff. This is Rincon 
Point, the queen of the California coast. Rumor has it that the longest 
recorded tube ride took place here: A surfer named Mickey Munoz purportedly 
tucked inside a wave for 20 seconds and emerged with his hair dry. 
</P>
<P>
 The tube ride being an adrenal thrill matched only by illicit pharmaceuticals 
and honeymoons, Rincon is a popular place. Back when Brown was fussing with his 
first "Endless Summer," a chosen few surfers sampled Rincon's flawlessly 
peeling waves, sliding soulfully across sparkling walls that could unreel for 
as long as half a mile. 
</P>
<P>
 The wave still exists, only these days it's hard to see because of the coating 
of surfers smothering the water. Surfing Rincon on a good day is a bit like 
wandering about the floor of the New York Stock Exchange, only the floor of the 
exchange is a great deal chummier. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the parking lot is empty. This means one of two things. The surf is 
abominable or we arrived moments after a nuclear attack. 
</P>
<P>
 It's so bad that neither Dave nor Gavin even consider going out. 
</P>
<P>
 We drive south again, back to Emma Wood State Beach. Though you wouldn't know 
it most of the time, Emma Wood is home to one of California's best big-wave 
surf spots. It's called Ventura Overhead, and it reputedly serves up waves as 
big as 20 feet, horribly powerful things that test the skills of the expert and 
the bladder control of the not-so-proficient. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the wave breaks on a shallow reef a half-mile out to sea, gauging the 
size from shore can be difficult. Several years back, some friends and I, 
peering out on a diamond bright December day, estimated a wave to be eight 
feet. Out in the water it was decidedly bigger. One friend fractured a rib; I 
escaped with a near drowning. 
</P>
<P>
 Today we aren't looking out to sea. We are looking just off the sandy beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," says Dave. "This looks like fun. The right peak looks good." 
</P>
<P>
 I strain to see where Dave is pointing. It appears to be some 20 yards north 
of where two elderly men stand in waist-deep water. 
</P>
<P>
 In my mind there are two scenes in "Endless Summer II" that bottle the essence 
of surfing. One occurs when Wingnut and O'Connell, escorted by Australian 
surfing legend Nat Young, head for one of Young's favorite spots. They drive 
along 30 miles of desolate beach, then turn right and head out another eight 
miles on a protruding sand spit to find . . . nothing. So they go surfing 
anyhow, O'Connell bellying in on his stomach on a wave that can't be bigger 
than six inches, fists pumping overhead in unrestrained glee. 
</P>
<P>
 I look back to where Dave is pointing. Sure enough, a two-foot wave rolls in, 
peeling off quickly in knee-deep water, prompting Dave and Gavin to change into 
their wet suits faster than runway models. We grab waves for an hour, enjoying 
ourselves despite the copious amounts of sand drilled up our noses. Our waves 
are four times the size of the ones at Nat Young's secret spot. 
</P>
<P>
 By 9:30 a.m. we are driving south again, chased by the specter of wind, 
already starting to puff lightly onshore, picking absently at the ocean's 
smooth surface. For the surfer the wind can be a boon or a curse. Wind blowing 
off the land can sculpt waves into perfect canvasses. Wind blowing off the 
ocean has the opposite effect: Imagine someone grooming your favorite ski slope 
with a grenade launcher. 
</P>
<P>
 We arrive at the Santa Clara River mouth to find the wind blowing steadily 
onshore. Still, the waves appear to be good, another two feet larger. Dave 
hails a surfer who had just exited the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything out there?" 
</P>
<P>
 This is a standard surfing ritual in which surfers with dry hair consult 
surfers with wet hair as to conditions easily viewed from where each party 
stands. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely worth going out," says our oracle. "A south swell's just 
beginning to show. It'll probably be real good tomorrow." This is another 
surfing standard. In surfing the two best days are yesterday and tomorrow, 
making it difficult to get good surf unless you have access to a time machine. 
</P>
<P>
 We hike down the beach and paddle out near the mouth of the Santa Clara River. 
The waves are three to four feet. For the first time, the sun pokes through the 
curtain of gray. Pelicans grouped on the beach strut about like a convention of 
maitre d's. I catch several nice waves in a row, one or two as high as my head. 
Several times I am also pitched flat on my face. Still, I take both as 
promising signs. The surf is picking up, our day exhibiting a promising trend. 
</P>
<P>
 I watch Dave and Gavin. They grab wave after wave. Occasionally they drift 
together and talk, a conversation generally centered on the merits of their 
last wave. Dave and Gavin surf together five days a week. I envy them. 
Surfing's early infatuation is sometimes compared to the first days of love. 
It's a hokey analogy, but not entirely untrue; few moments are more edged with 
excitement, allure and hormone-bubbling-promise of things to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the love struck have to break for succor. Over greasy hamburgers we plot 
our course for the afternoon. Actually, our plan is simple -- we head south. 
Because the coastline jigs and jags, Dave and Gavin reckon on finding a spot 
that is catching the incoming swell even better. I nod enthusiastically in 
agreement. Blind optimism has crept up and clubbed me senseless. It feels good. 
TURF TENSION 
</P>
<P>
 The first three stops on our southward journey are Oxnard Shores, Silver 
Strand and Port Hueneme. All three can produce heart-stopping surf, Silver 
Strand in particular. All three can also make your heart leap for other 
reasons, namely nasty localism. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty years ago, good surf in Ventura County might have seen as many as 50 
surfers competing for waves. Today it can be a fight just to get a parking 
spot. This is not a figure of speech. Empty waves being a scarce commodity, 
residents of certain locales have taken it upon themselves to harass, and at 
times physically thump, outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 How one qualifies as a local, I'm not sure. A friend of mine who grew up in 
Port Hueneme and now lives in Ventura still surfs Port Hueneme's waters with 
impunity, though at times he is threatened by new locals who don't recognize 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier I had been warned about localism by Stan Fujii, owner of the Ventura 
Surfshop and a local surfer since 1966. He thought the idea of surfing the 
county was a good one, but he counseled that I be careful in my mention of 
certain surf spots. Previously published articles that had named coveted surf 
spots, said Fujii, had resulted in death threats. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's pretty safe to name spots that are easily accessible," said Fujii. "But 
when you start naming spots that are a little hard to get to, that's when you 
start getting into trouble. What's the adventure if you give all the work 
away?" 
</P>
<P>
 Truth is, I don't see exiting the freeway and driving for 10 minutes as much 
work. But I like Fujii, and I agree with his premise. Today you can phone a 
surf report without leaving bed (see sidebar). And there are a host of 
commercial guides who will escort you to exotic locales, eliminating your risk 
of contracting malaria or becoming an appetizer for the local fauna. 
</P>
<P>
 In their quest for surf, the stalwart Wingnut and Pat O'Connell braved white 
sharks and salt water crocs, as well as the 40-pound droppings from well-fed 
hippos, which I regard as more dangerous, and possibly more intelligent, than 
thuggish locals. 
</P>
<P>
 We aren't threatened by locals at Oxnard Shores, Silver Strand or Port Hueneme 
as the surf is so bad no one in their right mind would claim it, much less 
defend it. Though I am disappointed, I'm also relieved as my self-defense 
skills center on a good pair of shoes and lots of room to move. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing on the beach at Silver Strand, watching rafts and inner tubes bob 
about in the surf line, even Gavin is morose. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is sad," he says. "This is worse than the Point." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he brightens. 
</P>
<P>
 "County Line is going to be going off," he blurts. "I just say that because I 
want that." 
</P>
<P>
 There are surf spots between Port Hueneme and County Line, most notably a 
number of superb breaks in the waters off the naval base at Point Mugu. But 
surfing there requires either access to the base or a fast moving boat. 
</P>
<P>
 We swing past Mugu and head down the Pacific Coast Highway toward County Line. 
On the tape deck a group called Green Day scream a primal lament, "Do you have 
time to listen to me whine?" They may have had cause to whine, but we don't. It 
is now 2 in the afternoon and the sun shines brilliantly, turning the ocean an 
impossibly deep blue. Offshore, kelp beds move en masse. A sea breeze sweeps 
through, its cool palm caressing our sun-burnt faces. WAY TO ESCAPE 
</P>
<P>
 The second scene in "Endless Summer II" that captures the spirit of surfing 
involves a sprightly fellow named Walter. Walter is a South African and the 
buddy of Shaun Tomson, a famous professional surfer from that country. There is 
some footage of Tomson making beautiful, balletic moves in powerful surf. There 
is footage of Walter riding the same waves, looking somewhat stiff-legged, as 
most amateurs would in such challenging surf. Post surf, Walter beams into the 
camera, his entire face alight. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I've got a problem, I don't think about that problem, I think about the 
waves," says Walter, which is probably a good thing because Walter can't swim. 
</P>
<P>
 Even mediocre surf carries with it the promise of blessed transport. Immersed 
in a balm of sun, salt and flat out fun, it's easy to forget that you were 
supposed to unclog the kitchen sink and clean the bathroom for company. 
Irresponsible escapism? Sure. But don't lecture me until you stop dropping 
those unopened questionnaires in the trash. 
</P>
<P>
 When I spoke to Brown, he told me that most of the surf he rides is lousy. But 
it didn't seem to bother him much. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last week Wingnut stopped by, and we all went surfing and it was barely 
ridable," said Brown. "But we really had a whole lot of fun. It was a warm, 
sunny day, there wasn't anyone else around and we were just laughing and 
giggling and acting like fools. To me that's about as much fun as you can 
have." 
</P>
<P>
 Which makes it twice as nice when we pull up to County Line to see neatly 
groomed four-foot waves sweeping into the beach under a bright sun. No, it 
isn't perfect. Sure there are other surfers out. But that doesn't stop my heart 
from beating fast. This time I beat Dave and Gavin into the water, though after 
a time I paddle off by myself. Lying prone, I watch microscopic wind riffles 
move across the kelp, sunlight etching each sinuous line until it drifts under 
the nose of my board and disappears. I shut my eyes and drift off with them. 
</P>
<P>
 As Gavin would later say, "It was a fun day. Way fun." Where to Find the Big 
Waves 
</P>
<P>
 In "Endless Summer II," filmmaker Bruce Brown postulates that it would take a 
surfer 50 years to ride every known wave in the world. Most of us possess 
neither the time nor the cash. The good news is there's plenty of great surf 
right here in Ventura County. Finding it, however, could require digging. Or 
you could just refer to these two excellent guides: 
</P>
<P>
 * "Surfing Guide to Southern California" by David Stern and Bill Cleary; 
Mountain and Sea Publishing, P.O. Box 126, Redondo Beach, CA 90277. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Surfing California" by Bank Wright; Mountain and Sea Publishing, P.O. Box 
126, Redondo Beach, CA 90277. 
</P>
<P>
 Surf hounds who don't like to read have other options. They can call (310) 
976-SURF to get a recording that plays some groovy music and then instructs 
local dudes to punch 8-0-5. That provides a thorough look at surf in Central 
California and Ventura County. Cost is $1.50 plus toll charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Surfers can also dial the KTYD/Morningstar Surf Line at 967-7411. Plus, they 
can listen to KTYD for the surf report Monday through Friday at 6:45 a.m. Or 
they can call the Ventura Surf Shop at 643-1062.

SHE FOLLOWED HER HEART INTO ART; INTERNSHIP: ROSEMEAD HIGH ALUMNA REJECTED A 
MORE PRACTICAL CAREER TO STUDY HOW CREATIVITY AND CULTURE ARE INTERTWINED. 
</P>

<P>
 Before taking a class during her senior year at Rosemead High School, Lisa 
Chan thought art history was nothing more than learning the difference between 
a Monet and Manet, a Picasso and Pissarro. 
</P>
<P>
 But while earning an art history degree at UCLA last spring and interning at 
museums in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., Chan, 22, has discovered there's 
almost no end to where art history can lead. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, Chan was one of 12 undergraduates chosen for an internship with 
the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu. Assigned to the sculpture department, she 
was responsible for researching the cultural and historical references depicted 
in works from Italy, France, Holland and Finland. 
</P>
<P>
 "All aspects of a piece are researched before we purchase it, but then we can 
look at certain aspects of it more extensively," said Peggy Fogelman, Chan's 
internship supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, French artist Joseph Chinard incorporated a technique usually 
reserved for tomb monuments in his 1790 marble sculpture of the van Risanburgh 
family. Chan was asked to research various aspects of this technique, including 
why Chinard used it and when it was most popular. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love art history because it ties into other areas, such as the humanities 
and social sciences," Chan said. "There's a lot of research and detective work 
involved in it." 
</P>
<P>
 The in-depth descriptions will be included in a catalogue the museum is 
compiling, Fogelman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chan said her parents support her commitment to art history, but do not 
understand it. "They wanted me to study something more practical in college. 
They were always telling me, 'You can be a lawyer or an accountant.' But my 
heart was in art history." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hong Kong native broke more than one mold by pursuing a career in art 
history. "A lot of people expect me to study Chinese art because non-Caucasians 
tend to focus on the art they're most comfortable with," she said. "But I'm 
really fascinated with European art." 
</P>
<P>
 Chan has worked in the publications department at the Museum of Contemporary 
Art in Los Angeles and in the merchandising department of the Phillips 
Collection in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 When her internship ends with the Getty Museum this week, she will head to the 
East Coast for a 10-month internship in the education department of the 
Brooklyn Museum of Art. There, she said, she will help develop public programs, 
lectures and symposiums.

COMMUNITY NEWS: ANGELES NATIONAL FOREST; USER FEES MAY BE INSTITUTED TO KEEP 
PICNIC AREAS OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the shadow of the Angeles National Forest, the new chief of the U.S. Forest 
Service said last week that a forest entry fee is one possible way to avoid 
shutting down more campground and picnic areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can look at the potential for cooperative user fees with states and 
counties," said Chief Jack Ward Thomas at a Pasadena press conference."We could 
possibly seek permission for pilot efforts for the collection of user fees, if 
Congress should see that as appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas was scheduled to tour the Angeles and San Bernardino national forests 
on a three-day meeting with managers of the country's 12 urban national forests 
in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton appointed Thomas to head the Forest Service in November, 
signaling the administration's intention to overhaul the agency. Thomas, 59, is 
a renowned Oregon wildlife biologist who drew attention to the plight of the 
spotted owl. His agency manages 191 million acres with 34,000 employees and an 
annual budget of $3.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of paying for entry to national forests is controversial but is 
gaining attention as federal funding dwindles and attendance grows. In the Mt. 
Baldy ranger district, for instance, 90% of the camping spots have been closed 
because of budget cuts. In the last year, the forest service has laid off 2,700 
employees nationwide.

and the County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner graduated from Greeley Teachers College in her home state of Colorado 
before moving to California in 1929 and marrying Everette (Bill) Steiner, who 
died more than 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 As a young woman, Steiner enjoyed trick shooting from horseback and rodeo 
horse racing. Later, she wrote and spoke about children and women's rights, 
while continuing her education at UCLA and USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include her sister, Betty Lee Robb, four sons and 18 grandchildren

COMMUNITY NEWS: WEST VALLEY; KAHN SUPPORTED BY POLICE, FIREFIGHTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A statewide law enforcement association and local police and firefighter 
groups have endorsed Democratic congressional candidate Doug Kahn after 
Republican incumbent Carlos Moorhead voted against the federal crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The Peace Officers Research Assn. of California (PORAC) join the Pasadena 
Police Officers' Assn. and Burbank and Pasadena firefighters in support of 
Kahn, who is challenging Moorhead (R-Glendale) for his seat in the 27th 
District, which stretches from the San Fernando Valley to San Marino. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime bill passed by the House of Representatives Sunday included several 
million dollars for Southland police departments. It would also ban assault 
rifles. 
</P>
<P>
 Kahn said Moorhead caved in to pressure from the National Rifle Assn. by 
voting for an amendment that would have removed the assault weapons ban from 
the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides to Moorhead said he voted against the crime bill Sunday because of its 
heavy spending on social programs and restrictions on the right to bear arms. 
They noted that Moorhead historically has been endorsed by law enforcement 
agencies in his 22 years in Congress.

 Next week we'll be turning the calendar to September and gearing up for 
school, football and a barrage of attack ads from political campaigners. 
Meanwhile, I'm flipping back through calendar pages to recall some books 
produced by local authors. It's an impressive list: romance, biography, 
finance, children and young adult, mysteries, true crime, war adventures, 
history and science. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley author Margaret Brownley's "The Kissing Bandit" and "Rawhide and 
Lace" are romances with a western flavor. Ojai's Margaret Jones is getting 
great reviews for her "Patsy Cline" biography. Two really good financial guides 
are by Ojai authors Joline Godfrey's "Our Wildest Dreams," written for women 
entrepreneurs about making money and having fun, and "The First Time Investor" 
by Larry Chambers and Kenn Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathryn Cocquyt, author of "Little Freddie's Legacy," has written her first 
historical novel, "The Celtic Heart," to be released in September. Ventura 
writer Reanne Singer's "The Storms Crossing" is a breakthrough young adult 
novel about incest. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park's Sharan Newman is working on a third medieval mystery to follow 
"Death Comes as Epiphany" and "The Devil's Door." LAPD detective Paul Bishop's 
latest book is "Darling Kill Me Again." "Rancho Mirage" by Thousand Oaks' Aram 
Saroyan is a true-crime chiller. 
</P>
<P>
 "Combat He Wrote" was just released by Lt. Col. Charles Hudson and Ross Olney. 
"Shipwrecks, Smugglers and Maritime Mysteries" by Eugene Wheeler and Robert 
Kallman is one of my favorites. And finally, Ventura's Kathryn Phillips has 
sounded an alarm with her book about an ecological mystery, "Tracking the 
Vanishing Frogs." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Barnes & Noble Bookstore is hosting a variety of events this week. At 7 
tonight, Christopher Howard, author of "The Golden Door to Retirement and 
Living in Costa Rica," will discuss how to budget, find housing and acquire 
proper residency in Costa Rica. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1 to 3 p.m. Saturday, Los Angeles resident Ellen Jones will sign "Beloved 
Enemy," her historical novel about Eleanor of Aquitaine, the medieval duchess 
who married two kings and was the mother of Richard the Lion-Hearted. Jones' 
first novel was "The Fatal Crown." 
</P>
<P>
 At 7:30 p.m. Tuesday, employee-poets of Barnes & Noble will be the featured 
readers at the monthly poetry night. An "open mike" session for anyone wanting 
to share work will follow. The bookstore is at 4360 E. Main St., Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gillian Roberts will sign her new Amanda Pepper mystery, "How I Spent My 
Summer Vacation," at 2 p.m. Saturday at Mysteries to Die For, 2940 Thousand 
Oaks Blvd., Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Braverman, who lived for eight years in a Zen Buddhist abbey in Japan, 
will discuss his book, "Warrior of Zen Diamond: Hard Wisdom of Shosan" at 2 
p.m. Saturday in the Ventura Bookstore, 522 E. Main St. Braverman now teaches 
at the Krishnamurti School in Ojai.

SOUNDS: LIFE IN JAZZ'S IN-BETWEEN ZONE; KEYBOARDIST JOHN BEASLEY'S MUSICAL 
VOCABULARY RANGES FROM ELECTRIC-ECLECTIC TO BE-BOP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Too often, jazz in Southern California cleaves to one or two schools of 
thought. Mainstream jazz has its stalwart clutch of practitioners and devotees. 
On the other end, there is the vapid gravy train of "contemporary jazz," for 
which the term jazz may be a misnomer. 
</P>
<P>
 But wait: that's not the whole story. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the case of keyboardist John Beasley, who, at 34, has long made his way 
in an in-between zone. Beasley's vocabulary stretches from the 
electric-eclectic end of the spectrum to more be-bop-influenced territory. The 
Louisiana-born, Texas-raised and, since 1977, Los Angeles-based musician is 
nothing if not versatile. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been this versatility that has earned Beasley coveted work with Freddie 
Hubbard and with the late Miles Davis after the release of Davis' last official 
studio album, "Amandla." Beasley has also been bassist John Patitucci's chief 
keyboardist since the two met at Carnegie Hall while playing with Hubert Laws 
in 1981. Beasley has also done a lot of rent-paying studio work -- for TV, 
film, records and commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 For further proof of Beasley's healthfully split personality, listen to last 
year's "Change of Heart" album on the now-defunct Windham Hill Jazz label. The 
underrated album, produced by Walter Becker (on whose forthcoming debut solo 
album Beasley played), is an inspiring representation of how a jazz artist can 
cross boundaries with integrity intact. 
</P>
<P>
 See Beasley live when he brings a quartet to White Winds Studio in Montecito 
Friday night. Joining Beasley will be bassist Alphonso Johnson, drummer Gary 
Novak and saxophonist Steve Taviglione, all provocative, genre-bending 
musicians from L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning that Beasley did this interview, he was on his way to a 
recording session for Patitucci's newest project, and had just moved into a new 
house near Marina del Rey. After living in an apartment, the affable Beasley 
was enthused about relocating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moving into this house and finally being able to play my piano whenever I 
want, having my studio right here in the next room -- it seems like the start 
of a new era," he said. "I'm not sure what it's going to bring or where it's 
going to go yet. But it feels good and it feels like the start of a new 
creative period." 
</P>
<P>
 Was the experience in Miles Davis' band in the late '80s a real turning point 
for you? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, both musically and personally. I felt like I became a man in a lot of 
ways. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was a rite of passage? 
</P>
<P>
 It was, in a way. A lot of things happened at the same time. That same year, I 
had just gotten married and my wife was pregnant and I had just bought a house. 
</P>
<P>
 Musically, just being able to comp behind him, I don't think my ears have ever 
been so in tune with the music around me. He commanded that without ever really 
saying anything. He heard every note he played. 
</P>
<P>
 Your song 'Carnal Appetite' is reminiscent of mid-'70s Herbie Hancock, which 
is more refreshing to hear than the garden variety pop-jazz going around these 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, you mean instrumental pop? Well, on that song, we're blowing over that 
funky rhythm and stretching it out. We're not just staying there, copping that 
groove, hanging out there and having a margarita by the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Things will come back again, though. It's all a cycle. Hasn't there always 
been pop-jazzy guys? Think of Herbie Mann. "Watermelon Man. . ." I don't know 
if there's actually a correlation between Kenny G and all these guys, though. 
I'm trying to find one. 
</P>
<P>
 You've been a part of a circle of L.A. musicians who are broad-minded and have 
something to say. Is it inevitable that certain types of musicians just 
naturally gravitate toward each other? 
</P>
<P>
 I think so. You're on a gig and this guy shows up who you've never played 
with, and you click on the gig for those reasons. There is a jazz scene here of 
musicians who can really play. There isn't much opportunity to hear them play 
and often, when they do go out and play at a little club, not many people come 
out and support it, because they want to hear the other stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 I hate to generalize, but it seems that in Los Angeles, you either find real 
straight-ahead jazz or else this hot tub, happy jazz. We do get college kids 
coming out. 
</P>
<P>
 But we hang tough. We go out and play anyway. We have to. Details

THEATER REVIEW; INNOVATIVE FORMAT CAN'T SAVE TIRESOME 'CRIME OF DANNY SEGAL' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plays about overbearing, protective mothers, especially the cliched Jewish 
mother, are not exactly the stuff of original drama. 
</P>
<P>
 First-time playwright Bobby Wittenberg seems to understand this, so he 
attempts an innovative approach to a comedy about a Jewish mother who refuses 
to let go of her only son. 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Crime of Danny Segal" at the Knightsbridge Theatre in Old Town, the 
desperate character of the mother sues her son "for ruining his life" when the 
young man moves out of the house and into an apartment with his girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, this quasi-courtroom comedy/fantasy, complete with a Greek 
chorus of a jury composed of three Jewish matrons commenting on the courtroom 
testimony, is tired material in a new format. It has perhaps enough good stuff 
for a sketch, but stretched over two acts the result is more grueling than 
captivating. 
</P>
<P>
 There is one silver lining: The production is nominally salvaged by the 
performance of John Ricci, a New York actor with a light comedic touch who is 
making his West Coast theater debut. He plays the alternately shamed and 
guilt-ridden son whose anxieties and rebellion are dramatized in a series of 
flashbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran actress Rose Maling, playing hurt, manipulative and whiny Mama to the 
hilt, not only wears out her son but the audience as well. 
</P>
<P>
 She has only one screechy note to play and it becomes awfully tiresome. If 
director Linda L. Rand, who helmed the Knightsbridge's earlier "Black Coffee," 
had given the mother an ounce of charm or humor -- something to humanize her -- 
the production might even have succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, the thin comedy is in the hands of the three-woman jury (Roberts 
West, Joan-Carol Bensen and Deanne Mencher), who cannot sustain the joke. 
</P>
<P>
 Others on stage are bland characters with little to add to the mix -- a 
grim-faced judge (Eddie Pratt), the disaffected son's sweet, ineffective father 
(George Klein), who designs toys, and the young hero's girlfriend (Laura 
Benningfield, whose character and straight lines are as conventional as they 
come, but who does a terrific job of looking like an East Coast preppy). 
</P>
<P>
 A scrappy reporter (Melanie Ewbank) appears on stage for a couple of minutes 
and manages to exhibit almost every cliche of the oft-maligned media as 
represented in theater and movies. 
</P>
<P>
 The three interiors by set designer George Klein intelligently exploit the 
cramped stage, whose oppressive low ceiling is the biggest structural hurdle 
facing the Knightsbridge Theatre. Lighting design by Jim San Filippo and 
costume design by Sallie Licata are first rate. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Crime of Danny Segal," Knightsbridge Theatre, 35 S. Raymond Ave. 
(Braley Building), Pasadena, Friday, 7 p.m.; Sunday matinee, 2 p.m. Ends Sept. 
25. $15-$10. (818) 440-0821. Running time: 1 hour, 35 minutes.

DIAMOND BAR: RECALL PETITIONS, FINANCE MEETINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I want to complain a little about Kevin Uhrich's article "Diamond Bar in the 
Rough" (Aug. 11). Technically the article is basically correct, but its attempt 
to be sardonically whimsical casts the same light on all players. 
</P>
<P>
 We have worked hard and long to change our city's pro-growth leadership. We 
are the regular, normal citizens -- "the little guys." Of course we argue, 
debate and "squabble," but so would you in order to expose special interests 
who have been detrimentally running your community. 
</P>
<P>
 To cast Councilwoman Eileen Ansari and me in the same recall light as 
Councilman Gary Miller is wrong. Over 6,000 residents signed his petition, 
which is still pending in court, while the recall against Ansari and me was 
signed by 23 people and never filed. Ansari's would not have qualified anyway, 
since six of the signers were Walnut residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond Bar is a great city, and incorporation has meant improved public 
services from law enforcement to street maintenance because we have redirected 
millions of dollars back to local use. But creating a smaller mud puddle 
shouldn't mean we have to put up with smaller-minded politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAIR W. HARMONY Mayor Pro-Tem Diamond Bar  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was very disappointing to me when my friend Clair Harmony, Diamond Bar's 
mayor pro-tem, felt it necessary to resign from the Finance Committee (Aug. 
11). I have attended three finance meetings and find them most interesting, and 
since these meetings are open sessions to the public I think more Diamond Bar 
citizens should sit in and learn how their taxpayer monies are spent. 
</P>
<P>
 There does not seem to be a consistent format to these meetings. The current 
council members arrive late and leave early, which doesn't leave enough time to 
study the several-page warrant register. It seems that when Clair Harmony was 
on the committee, he probed into discrepancies that he found. Since his 
departure, the emphasis seems to be more toward speeding the meeting along.

LIBRARY: 'SALAD BOWL' ANALOGY FOR MODERN LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After I read the article, "Accusations of Racism Plague Monterey Park Library 
Board" on July 28, I was totally appalled. The American dream is not dead for 
anyone coming to this country in search of better opportunities, but the 
melting pot is no longer an appropriate statement; we are a "salad bowl" where 
each of us is unique and contributes to this society and our communities in 
different ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, (Kathleen) Brzozowski's comments on Marina Tse are so racially 
motivated that it is discouraging for those of us who believe that pluralism 
and diversity are ingredients for a society rich in culture(s). Marina Tse is 
the co-founder of the Multicultural Community Assn. in which all ethnic groups 
work together to promote inter-group relations in our community, and we need 
more committed people like her in our communities.

REEL LIFE / FILM & VIDEO FILE; FILMMAKER RICK RIDGEWAY'S STOCK CLIMBS; THE 
VENTURA MOUNTAINEER'S EXPLOITS HAVE GIVEN RISE TO A CAREER MAKING ADVENTURE 
DOCUMENTARIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PANCHO DOLL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's easy to forget that filmmaker Rick Ridgeway uses a sophisticated computer 
database to keep track of the 100,000 pictures and 100 hours of film in 
archives at the stock photo agency he runs in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 His personal archive -- everything from his elementary school diploma to a 
1979 magazine article on notable Americans under the age of 35 in which he 
appears next to Arkansas' newly elected governor, a little-known whiz kid named 
Bill Clinton -- is stored not on a disc but in a cardboard box. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridgeway, a mountaineer of international reputation, earned the placement next 
to Clinton by topping K2, the world's second-highest peak. But these days 
you're more likely to see him in the credits of adventure films. He just 
finished work on an ESPN special about gliders and he directed the Alpine 
scenes on Africa's 17,000-foot Mt. Kenya for a film titled "The Ascent," which 
debuts Sept. 15 at the Toronto Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridgeway explained how he made the transition from climbing bum to 
photographer and filmmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had this flash when I was on the American Bicentennial expedition on 
Everest. I was helping an NBC cameraman set up his camera at 20,000 feet and 
this light bulb went off in my head. The two of us were doing the same thing, 
only he was getting paid for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then he's filmed or directed several segments for ESPN and network 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think storytelling is important. I was a writer before I was a filmmaker 
(he's written three books including "Seven Summits" with late Disney executive 
Frank Wells) and I try to bring that sense of narrative to the film projects 
I'm involved in." 
</P>
<P>
 Once when shooting a special for ABC in the Venezuelan jungle, he 
intentionally let the expedition run short on rations. They were climbing a 
2,500-foot-tall granite spire in an unpopulated section of the jungle where the 
nearest inhabitants, the Yanomami Indians, are so primitive their counting 
system consists of "one, two, many." 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew the Yanomami wouldn't be able to carry enough food for us, but I just 
thought that would contribute to the drama. You know a one-hour television show 
has eight acts in it, so I'm always thinking how to divide the documentary into 
acts for dramatic purposes." 
</P>
<P>
 Ridgeway said that by the end of the five-day climb, their daily ration was 
down to one-half a Power Bar and a handful of granola each. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we got back down to the camp after the climb, it was dark. The Yanomami 
had picked these fruits for us to eat. We didn't know what they were, but they 
were delicious. I turned on my lantern to see how many were left in the basket 
and discovered they were crawling with maggots. My partner looked at me, said, 
'Turn off that light,' and we kept eating." 
</P>
<P>
 Ridgeway and team made it back to civilization. Since then, Adventure Photo, 
the stock agency he started in 1988, has taken off, growing more than 40% since 
January, he said. Now that the business is starting to function on its own, 
Ridgeway is going to devote more of his time to writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Good thing, too. Word about his filming expeditions travels fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys on the Venezuela expedition were some of the toughest climbers in 
the world," Ridgeway said, "and after it was over they were telling other 
people never to go out with me."

SAN GABRIEL FALLS IN FINAL OF BABE RUTH WORLD SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Everything seemed to be in place Sunday for San Gabriel Valley in its bid to 
win its seventh Babe Ruth World Series title at the 16-year-old championship in 
Carmel, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 San Gabriel Valley had fine-tuned its offense Friday in scoring a 
tournament-high 16 runs in a thrashing of Indianola, Iowa, that earned it the 
right to play Marietta, Ga., in the title game. And San Gabriel Valley's 
pitching had been bolstered by an extra day's rest, which was provided by a 
thunderstorm that washed out Saturday's schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of San Gabriel Valley's preparation, it soon became apparent that 
nothing could end Marietta's weeklong cruise through the nine-team, 
double-elimination tournament. Marietta, which won its four tournament games by 
an average of five runs, continued its roll with a 6-1 win over San Gabriel 
Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can you say?" San Gabriel Valley Coach Victor Becerra asked. "They have 
a very strong team and we didn't play very well. They made the plays, we 
didn't, and that makes them the better team (Sunday)." 
</P>
<P>
 Although San Gabriel Valley needed to defeat unbeaten Marietta twice Sunday, 
it certainly wasn't an unrealistic task. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, San Gabriel Valley entered the game averaging a tournament-best 
eight runs a game and had a tournament-high seven home runs. And San Gabriel's 
pitching staff also was impressive, entering the title game with a tournament 
earned-run average of 1.00. 
</P>
<P>
 But Marietta's stingy pitching staff, which entered the game with two shutouts 
in three games and an earned-run average of 0.50, proved too strong for San 
Gabriel Valley. Chris Bowen, whose fastball has been clocked as high as 87 
m.p.h., limited San Gabriel Valley to five hits in winning his second game of 
the tournament. He lost a shutout when Joaquin Villalobos hit a home run. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowen teamed with tournament most valuable player Alex Shilliday, who didn't 
give up a run and only four hits in 14 innings, to limit San Gabriel Valley to 
one run in two head-to-head games. And this was a San Gabriel Valley team that 
had outscored its other tournament foes, 34-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had less than six walks in four games and that's the secret to winning 
ballgames," Marietta Coach Guerry Baldwin said. 
</P>
<P>
 San Gabriel Valley's lone weakness throughout the tournament was its 
sometimes-shoddy defense, an element that haunted it Sunday. Marietta took a 
1-0 lead on a passed ball in the first inning and three San Gabriel Valley 
errors enabled Marietta to score three unearned runs in the sixth, which gave 
the Astros an insurmountable 6-1 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 San Gabriel Valley finished with five errors that led to four unearned runs. 
</P>
<P>
 San Gabriel Valley's defense failed to support pitcher Steve Rodriguez, who 
gave up only two earned runs in five innings. Eric Valenzuela struck out the 
four batters he faced. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 San Gabriel Valley's Brian Llibre, who batted .500 with two home runs, was the 
tournament's batting champion. He earned the nod ahead of teammate Gabe Jurado, 
who also batted .500. Both players were named to the all-tournament team. . . . 
Joaquin Villalobos, an outfielder, was named to the Mizuno Outstanding Glove 
Team. . . . Eric Valenzuela gave up only one run in 11 1/3 innings. He struck 
out 16 and walked one. . . . Villalobos hit three home runs and Valenzuela and 
Llibre each added two.

HAVING A REALLY, RELAY GOOD TIME; SWIMMING: SIX MEMBERS OF THE POMONA-PITZER 
WOMEN'S TEAM SET A WORLD RECORD IN RELAY FROM PALOS VERDES TO CATALINA ISLAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It began as a collective exercise in pushing oneself to the limit. It ended 
with a world record. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, six members of the Pomona-Pitzer women's swim team completed a 
relay from Palos Verdes to Catalina Island in 8 hours, 27 minutes and 12 
seconds. The time over the approximate 21-mile distance smashed the record of 
11:01.00 that had been established by another group the year before. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll see how this pays off in everything else they do," said Pomona Coach 
Penny Lee Dean, a former world record-holder in several long-distance swimming 
events. "Whether it makes their pool swimming faster remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 "But more than that, this was an example of how you can accomplish something. 
If they go on to law school, or medical school, whatever they want to do, they 
can think back when times are tough and say, 'Oh yeah, way back when I did 
that. I know I can do this .' 
</P>
<P>
 "This was about getting them to believe in themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 The team included senior Judy Van Atta of Denver, junior Pam Reece of 
Manhattan Beach, sophomore Erin Moore of Hayward, junior Heather Royer of 
Fairbanks, Alaska, sophomore Lesley Pelton of Newtom, Mass., and freshman 
Camille Paton of La Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean said the idea was hatched in January by Van Atta, Royer and Pelton, who 
were searching for a way to break through performance plateaus. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean, who has coached at Pomona-Pitzer since 1978, was the perfect mentor for 
the attempt. A former All-American swimmer at Pomona College who graduated in 
1977, Dean set records for crossings of the English and Catalina channels. She 
was also the U.S. national long-distance coach for men and women for nine 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean, in fact, originally was recruited by team members to be part of the 
recent relay. However, she became ill during training in Alabama, where she 
doing work toward a doctorate in education, and was replaced by Paton. 
</P>
<P>
 The women trained on their own for most of the summer while working at jobs or 
internships throughout the country and gathered at the beginning of last week 
in Manhattan Beach for final preparations as a team. They did their first ocean 
swim on a Monday and continued to get acclimated to conditions Tuesday and 
Wednesday in preparation for the Thursday night attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 "The important thing was for them to get comfortable in the water and 
comfortable seeing things in the water -- to know those things wouldn't eat 
them," Dean said. "They had to meet their fears of sharks and (swimming in) the 
dark." 
</P>
<P>
 The crossing started at a spot near the old Marineland site in Palos Verdes at 
11:23 p.m. Each woman swam for approximately one hour while team members, Dean, 
parents and a navigator traveled in a support boat. A kayaker was also in the 
water accompanying the swimmer of the hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest thing we were trying to accomplish was to get them to try and 
push themselves further than they had before," Dean said. "They were to sprint 
from the beginning so they could go through the pain wall, see what it was 
like, and go on. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got lucky that the day we had chosen for the crossing came up warm and 
good conditions. It wasn't a full moon, but pretty close to it. It was one of 
those really rare crossings where we saw a few dolphins and a few flying fish, 
but not too many boats." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pomona women swam the final few hundred yards in unison, landing ashore on 
Catalina at Doctor's Cove about 8 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could see at the end that these women knew that it was something beyond 
what they thought was possible," Dean said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the swim, team members scattered for vacation or a semester of study in 
Europe as quickly as they had come together earlier in the week. But not before 
Dean offered some parting advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them, 'Any time you're having a rough time, you think of this world 
record. It may be broken, but this is something that is yours forever. You were 
a part of something special.' "

 Burial services were held Monday for Leo Asoau, a former standout athlete at 
Covina High who died Aug. 14 in a shooting incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Asoau, a 6-foot-3, 225-pound linebacker, was a Times All-San Gabriel Valley 
selection last year after he was named lineman of the year in the Valle Vista 
League. 
</P>
<P>
 Asoau had received a scholarship to play football at Washington State this 
season and was killed a week before he was scheduled to leave for Pullman, 
Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvador Michael Camarillo, 19, has been charged with murder and assault with 
a firearm in the case. He will be arraigned Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Covina Coach Dick Sheehan said players at the school are coping with the 
tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're doing OK," Sheehan said. "It's obviously been the worst start to 
football anyone can imagine. I just think it's a situation where the best thing 
is to get the kids into football itself, get them running around out there and 
doing things." 
</P>
<P>
 Donations to a memorial fund in Asoau's name can be sent in care of Renae 
Zangenberg at California State Bank, 100 N. Barranca St., West Covina, 91791.

AT THE MARKET: VARIETIES OF DRY ONIONS DIFFER IN FLAVOR AND SHELF LIFE; THE 
SWEETS, SUCH AS THE WALLA WALLA, HAVE HIGH SUGAR AND WATER CONTENT. IT'S THE 
PUNGENT STORAGE TYPE THAT WILL MAKE YOU CRY. 
</P>

 It happens seasonally, and seemingly overnight, on a stretch of fertile Oxnard 
plain that borders the Ventura Freeway. As harvesters proceed intently across 
the field, a vegetative landscape is transformed incrementally into erect 
stands of earth-toned, bulging burlap sacks. Once filled, these sacks look like 
they've been stuffed full of softballs. 
</P>
<P>
 The dry onion harvest has returned to Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Though anything but a prodigious harvest, dry onions account for several 
hundred acres of county farmland. This local summertime picking is but a tiny 
part of a greater countrywide harvest that keeps a wide variety of these 
ubiquitous cooking companions on produce shelves year-round. 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially, dry onions (onions that are protected by brittle, papery layers 
of skin) come in two varieties: sweet and storage. 
</P>
<P>
 First the sweets. These are the ones you are most likely to smother your 
hamburger with or chop into a potato salad or a zillion other recipes that call 
for mild onion embellishment. A sweet onion is not as likely to bring tears to 
your eyes as does its pungent counterpart, the storage onion. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the more famous sweet onion varieties include the large yellow Walla 
Walla, grown in Walla Walla County in southeastern Washington and northeastern 
Oregon. Another, the Vivaldi, comes from Georgia, and the Sweet Imperial hails 
from the Imperial Valley. There's also the more squat red or Italian versions 
and the gold-bronze Sweet Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Because some of these sweet varieties contain a high sugar and water content, 
they will begin to spoil within a couple weeks, so storage is a problem for 
growers, said Pete Nyarady of Rio Farms in Oxnard. Hence, their availability 
fluctuates throughout the year as harvest times ebb and flow. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, local markets are selling sweet red onions for about 69 cents a 
pound; the Sweet Spanish browns for 59 cents. It is advisable to purchase only 
what will be used right away, Nyarady said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spoilage, however, is far less a worry with "storage" onions, which are 
commonly stored for months at a time before making it to the grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
 The most predominant storage onion is the large Yellow Globe, which is 
available year round. If you are chopping up a few of these, keep the tissues 
at arms reach. "These are the real pungent, real hard varieties," said Nyarady 
said, who manages onion production at Rio Farms and in King City to the north. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of its stinging bite, the storage onion has proved to be the most 
popular for cooking. Strong or mild, both can certainly be used in most 
recipes, but the results won't necessarily satisfy. When cooking with sweet 
onions, carefulness need be applied: That sweet goodness will deflate quickly 
if overcooked. Storage onions can be disagreeable in salads and other 
preparations calling for raw onion. It's personal preference. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really just depends. Many (Latinos) will use the (stronger) onions for 
their fresh salsas for a bigger flavor," Nyarady said. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * PURCHASE TIPS: Nyarady said onion shoppers should look for good, uniform 
shape and be sure the skin is indeed brittle and the necks are dry, not moist. 
Why? Because it could be a sure sign that the onions were not "cured" long 
enough in the field. "The onions are placed in large burlap bags and left in 
the field to sit for three to seven days," he said. "If an onion isn't cured 
properly, it's not going to last very long on the shelf." Also, watch for signs 
of blemishes, including mildew or mold. Nyarady also suggested avoiding onions 
that are sprouting green tips.

SHOPTALK; OUT OF THE WOODS AND INTO THE MAINSTREAM; AS AN ACCESSORY THIS 
SEASON, BACKPACKS HAVE ARRIVED IN A VARIETY OF SIZES, COLORS AND FABRICS AND IN 
A RANGE OF PRICES. 
</P>

 This is the season of the backpack. And they're not just for kids and 
outdoorsy types anymore. Backpacks in all shapes, fabrics and sizes are being 
worn everywhere. From the practical nylon pack filled with books and pencils to 
the ultra-chic patent-leather backpack by Chanel, they come in all prices too. 
</P>
<P>
 We've shopped high and low for the best-priced and the best-looking backpacks. 
What we found were great deals on top-selling student packs and some really 
cool backpacks for the students of fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 If you can't see yourself carrying a backpack anymore than you can see 
yourself wearing a vinyl miniskirt, try again. A backpack feels good. Sling one 
on and you're instantly ready for adventure. Your hands are free to swing at 
your sides as you hike up a mountain trail or push a stroller at the mall. 
Backpacks are comfortable, too. The average purse can leave you with an aching 
shoulder or back. Pack a backpack with the same amount of stuff and you can 
walk comfortably for miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Sutter, a Ventura County chiropractor, says using a backpack makes 
sense. "A backpack is preferable to a shoulder bag. It distributes weight 
better and is less likely to injure." 
</P>
<P>
 Now for the shopping. For students, Jansport and Eastpak are the two major 
players. Both companies designed their backpacks for outdoor use by sportsmen 
and women. With just the right amount of Pacific Northwest styling, kids have 
discovered them to be great school bags. 
</P>
<P>
 These "sport" or "school" backpacks are made of incredibly strong, yet 
lightweight nylon. Most of them have organizers inside for writing implements 
and calculators. They also have leather bottoms for longevity, which is a good 
thing since they also have lifetime warranties. 
</P>
<P>
 Formerly, Jansport and Eastpak were found only in sporting goods stores. 
They're now sold at major department stores and discount stores like Target. At 
Target we found some of the lowest-priced styles, including Navajo for $23.99 
and Pinnacle for $35.99, both by Jansport. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullock's and Robinson's-May had many new styles and colors and both stores 
had sale prices. Robinson's had the lowest prices. Jansport's Right Pack was 
$39.99 at Robinson's and $49.99 at Bullock's. Savannah, also by Jansport, was 
$39.99 at Robinson's and $44.99 at Bullock's. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking a big hint from these practical backpacks, our favorite fashion 
backpacks are nylon too. This fabric is so functional, lightweight and easy to 
clean. DKNY makes one in black nylon for about $90. That's a great price for 
anything made by DKNY. Coach makes a couple of different leather backpacks. 
They're great looking but pricey. About $250 and up. 
</P>
<P>
 At Bullock's we saw lots of good-looking and much more reasonably priced 
backpacks by Esprit, Kenneth Cole and Roots. Liz Claiborne had a mini-backpack 
in solid or plaid suede for $56. 
</P>
<P>
 Contempo Casuals was a good source for stylish backpacks for very little cash. 
We liked a tiny black vinyl pack for $18. They also had a black nylon pack for 
$22 and a patchwork pack for $18. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're buying one of the pricier backpacks, make sure it has a zippered 
access to the main compartment. We've found the drawstring closure to be a real 
pain in the pack.

FASHION; BRA'S ARRIVAL PROVES UPLIFTING; VENTURA COUNTY IS ONE OF THE FIRST 
AREAS TO GET THE MUCH BALLYHOOED BRAS. SALES ARE BRISK, BUT NOT ALL BUYERS ARE 
SATISFIED.

 While women all though the nation wait restlessly for Wonderbra, a lucky few 
inVentura County are secure in its embrace. 
</P>
<P>
 The famous undergarment arrived in mid-August at selected Southern California 
locations, including Robinsons-May and JC Penney at The Oaks mall in Thousand 
Oaks. The ensuing buying panic immediately uplifted the stores' lingerie sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had an incredible sell-through over the weekend; we are in a heavy reorder 
mode," said Jim Watterson, spokesman for Robinsons-May, where the garment's 
unveiling was a local television news event. 
</P>
<P>
 A like phenomenon occurred across the way at JC Penney, a salesclerk reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't believe how many we sold," she said, "We put in another order an 
hour after we opened. There was always a swarm of people." 
</P>
<P>
 To handle overflow, Penney's had a backup of Vanity Fair pushup bras on sale 
for $13.99, roughly half the cost of the Wonderbra, but, "No one was 
interested," the clerk said. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder Wonderbra is a hot label -- the skimpy lace-and-wire garment has a 
lot going for it. 
</P>
<P>
 First, it's got that name: Wonderbra -- a word that could enter the language 
like Jell-O and Kleenex. How can you beat that? 
</P>
<P>
 Then, it's tied to a celebrity. Last winter a famous under-endowed model, Kate 
Moss, raved in the national press about the bra's cleavage power. 
</P>
<P>
 Wonderbra hysteria has been fueled by strong demand but also by short supply. 
Formerly produced in Britain, the bra went into U.S. production under the 
direction of Sara Lee (brownies and cheesecake) in May and won't be available 
nationwide until late October. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes the bra so wonderful? Supposedly, a unique design. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a feat of engineering," said Wonderbra spokeswoman Jill Golden. "Nobody 
has been able to quite replicate it." She used terms like precision placement 
of "underwire," three-piece cup construction and power-net back. 
</P>
<P>
 Thinking claims might be inflated, we went to The Oaks to find out. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not hard to track down the bras. Just follow the crowds to the special 
Wonderbra rack. The racks are backed by advertising posters featuring a 
life-size photo of a model in black lace and the message, "The one and only 
Wonderbra; it does wonders." The British version reportedly was more to the 
point: "Say goodby to your feet!" 
</P>
<P>
 All but two of the bras available were flame red -- white, black and champagne 
had sold out during the crush of the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Women were milling about, turning the bras inside out to study the 
engineering, which actually is pretty simple. The sides of the cups contain 
pads that are poised to give a horizontal nudge upward to whatever might be 
enclosed in them. 
</P>
<P>
 Several shoppers backed off when approached by a reporter, saying they just 
wanted to check out the product, not buy it. Others were serious buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Funcich of Westlake Village said, "I need a little lift; I'm going to a 
class reunion." She regretted not shopping when there was a color choice. After 
deliberating, she concluded that red under a black dress was not a crucial 
flaw. 
</P>
<P>
 About the same time, Jennifer Sandefur arrived and chose a front-closing model 
to try on. A receptionist at a Ventura firm, she had taken half a day off to 
make the pilgrimage to Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few minutes in the dressing room, both women emerged. Sandefur's 
mission had proved a bust. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expected some grandiose thing," she said, "It was a little uncomfortable -- 
a little stiff and tight." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Funcich headed for a counter and filled out a reservation form to 
make sure she gets in on the next shipment of Wonderbras. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm ordering one in every color," she said. "I love them." 
</P>
<P>
 The bras came to Southern California before any other part of the country 
because more women here asked for them, the Wonderbra spokesperson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, no one need be left guessing when her town will play host to the 
engineered lingerie. All it takes is a call to the Wonderbra hot line. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it was inevitable. Sara Lee could not handle the deluge of calls from 
eager fans, so it set up a computer to take requests for information. A call to 
1-800-4-NEWBRA will reveal the date when the bra will arrive at a city near 
you. 
</P>
<P>
 Until that time, you'll have to embark on a Wonderbra safari. Or prepare to 
stay acquainted with your feet just a little longer.

EARTHWATCH: SPACE RESEARCH PROVIDES TOOLS TO CLEAN ENVIRONMENT; AEROSPACE 
SCIENTISTS IN THOUSANDS OAKS HAVE DEVELOPED A LASER ANALYZER THAT IS BEING 
ADAPTED TO DETECT TOXIC GAS LEAKS ON EARTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 At Rockwell International's Science Center in Thousand Oaks, space scientists 
are discovering, willy-nilly, all kinds of things about the Earth. Whether the 
aerospace industry, NASA or the Kennedy-era science-fiction buffs who started 
the whole thing anticipated it or not, a lot of space research is turning out 
to be Earth research, resulting in some items of interest to Earthwatch 
readers. 
</P>
<P>
 As the old saying goes, "getting there is half the fun." In space, the other 
half is surviving there -- whether it's on a planned space station or a Mars 
expedition. 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out that the rules for space travelers are the same as for us 
stay-at-home types. We're all just folks sitting on an object hurtling through 
the void -- without way stations to provide fresh supplies. Nature rules 
throughout the universe, doling out solar energy and merely recycling 
everything else. 
</P>
<P>
 After a quarter-century of exalted space efforts and accompanying terminology 
-- Mercury, Atlas, Apollo -- our national space agency is now promoting humbler 
images. For instance, in dealing with Rockwell and other aerospace contractors, 
NASA officials have been spelling the word CELSS, an acronym for Controlled 
Ecological Life Support System. 
</P>
<P>
 The spin-off technology from this system may help us clean up the environment 
here on Earth. Minimally, the publicity attached to this kind of technology 
will point out, via the media, the whole concept of a biological life-support 
system. Alas, last week's aborted shuttle flight has postponed until October 
what was to have been a flurry of environmentally oriented space science news. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, undaunted Rockwell scientists, such as Thousand Oaks resident 
Maribeth Hunt, are finding down-to-earth uses for this technology. Airborne 
pollution due to accidental toxic gas leaks is a problem in a space station 
just as it is in a suburb near a factory. Hunt is packaging -- quite literally 
-- a spaceship's laser-powered, toxic-gas analyzer into something the size of a 
duffel bag so earthly health officials can use it to nail industrial polluters. 
One of several space spin-offs Hunt directs for Rockwell's Rocketdyne division, 
the product is called EcoScan. 
</P>
<P>
 She says that environmental health officials have told her, "I'd like to have 
one because then everyone would have to have one." Meaning: If businesses use 
the same gizmo to measure their activities as the health authorities do, maybe 
really egregious environmental mistakes can be avoided. It cuts two ways, of 
course. It's potentially good for the public's environmental health if it helps 
companies mind their environmental manners, but the same company might one day 
use the gizmo's data in court to try to rebut charges made by overzealous 
eco-cops. 
</P>
<P>
 In this spirit, when NASA eventually gets the shuttle up in orbit this fall, 
it will deploy a rig to measure and track oil spills in our oceans -- a neat 
idea if you're a member of Greenpeace but maybe daunting if you're an Exxon 
public relations officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Another spin-off program involves air and water purification by using plants. 
Earthwatch readers may recall how local architectural firms and plant nurseries 
have been getting together to find a cure for the "sick building syndrome." 
Space scientists at Rockwell have been taking this plant-based clean-air 
technology one step further -- and into space. The plants involved are a form 
of algae -- mere cells, really -- but effective. They're doing it to meet tight 
size requirements, among other concerns, but also they're discovering new, 
commercial ways that whole cities on Earth can use plants to clean sewage and 
use forests to mitigate air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Rockwell biologist Scott Johnson, "Devices like plants are the 
only way we can create a sustained presence off the Earth." Well, folks, that's 
the way we get a sustained supply of the stuff on Earth too. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's research, while primarily intended to enable manned flights to Mars, 
plainly dramatizes why we, on Earth, must keep up the fight to preserve our 
forests and wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems like you have to leave home to find out what home is all about. 
Details

Sewell, Rockwell Aerospace, at (818) 586-4572, or NASA at (800) 63-SPACE.

JAUNTS; UP CLOSE IN THE BACKCOUNTRY; A PARK RANGER WILL LEAD A 10-MILE TOUR OF 
THE NEW PUBLIC PARKLAND -- PALO COMADO CANYON -- WHICH IS WAY OFF THE BEATEN 
TRACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If you are undaunted by summer heat, here's the hike to take this Saturday: a 
10-mile guided tour of oak-lined Palo Comado Canyon, that scenic swath of new 
public parkland in eastern Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Park Service bought the canyon -- which, along with China Flat, 
forms 2,329-acre Jordan Ranch -- from entertainer Bob Hope last year for $16.7 
million. The Park Service opened it to hikers, mountain bikers and equestrians 
in November. 
</P>
<P>
 But the picturesque canyon is a little tricky to reach. The Park Service hopes 
to provide better access eventually, but for now access is through neighboring 
Cheeseboro Canyon, another chunk of public park land. That means you have to 
hike about two miles before you even get to the fire road that winds up into 
Palo Comado. 
</P>
<P>
 One way to learn the route and see some backcountry scenery in both canyons is 
to join Park Service Ranger Mark Boehler on Saturday's hike. 
</P>
<P>
 Boehler is meeting hikers in the parking lot of Cheeseboro Canyon at 8:30 a.m. 
for the outing, which he expects will last about six hours. Temperatures in the 
canyon earlier this month hit 110 degrees, so hikers should bring two or three 
quarts of water, as well as lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 From the parking lot, Boehler will start out on the Modello Trail, now the 
main access into Palo Comado. The trail follows a rather steep ridgeline, then 
goes up and down some grassy hills to the north, finally coming to the turnoff 
for Palo Comado. Then it's about a mile down into the canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 The canyon is a spectacular piece of land. Oak trees line the fire road, which 
climbs steadily as you hike through the canyon, providing astounding views 
along the way. Tiers of mountain peaks give it an Alps-like feel. The hillsides 
are dotted with rock outcroppings. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason the canyon is such a valuable natural resource is that it is more 
than a wildlife habitat: It's a vital wildlife corridor, providing a link to 
other wild areas for animals such as bobcats, coyotes, deer and mountain lions. 
Hikers will likely see wildlife, especially hawks and eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 All the cattle from Jordan Ranch were removed when it became public land, but 
the hiking group will walk by the remains of the ranching headquarters. Then 
Boehler will lead the group onto a trail taking them by what he calls a 
graveyard for dead cows. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of bizarre," he said. "There are all these bones from dead cows." 
How they got there he isn't sure. 
</P>
<P>
 From there he'll loop back into Cheeseboro Canyon, hooking into Sheep Corral 
Trail and then back out to the parking lot via Sulphur Springs Trail. 
</P>
<P>
 The hike won't go as far as China Flat, the beautiful meadow that rises out of 
Palo Comado Canyon and overlooks distant mountains. But it will take in some 
striking views, Boehler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way he will point out some nifty features. "(Hikers) will see a 
unique oak tree, a hybrid really, a cross between a valley oak and a coast live 
oak," he said. "It's very strange." 
</P>
<P>
 He will also point out far-off Oat Mountain, a peak that rose 16 inches as a 
result of the Jan. 17 earthquake. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Ranger-led 10-mile hike in Palo Comado and Cheeseboro canyons in 
eastern Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Hikers will meet in the parking lot of Cheeseboro Canyon. Take the 
Chesebro Road exit off the Ventura Freeway. Go north on Palo Comado Canyon Road 
and turn right on Chesebro Road at the stop sign. Follow it to the park. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Saturday, 8:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * CALL: (818) 597-9192.

FOR THE KIDS; LAST-MINUTE ADVENTURE BEFORE CLASS BELL SOUNDS; THERE'S STILL 
TIME TO CATCH THE TAIL END OF 'THE WORLD OF PETER RABBIT' AT SANTA BARBARA'S 
NATURAL HISTORY MUSEUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They're nearly gone, those last few days of summer vacation. The start of the 
new school year is ever so close for most kids, but there is still a little 
time left for an adventure or two. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to go? 
</P>
<P>
 You can catch the tail end of "The World of Peter Rabbit" at the Natural 
History Museum in Santa Barbara. The exhibit ends Sept. 5, and even if you've 
already seen it, it's worth seeing twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone knows Beatrix Potter's story of Peter Rabbit, who disobeys his mother 
and sneaks into old Mr. McGregor's garden, only to find himself in big trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum's auditorium has been transformed into Mr. McGregor's garden -- all 
from a rabbit's eye view, of course, so the cabbages are five feet around, the 
carrot tops nine feet tall and the watering can is so large that children can 
crawl inside, just as Peter did to escape the old farmer. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember the "Tale of Mrs. Tiggy-Winkle"? The kindly old hedgehog in bonnet 
and apron is there too, laundering the clothes of little forest creatures. 
Children can also see the dollhouse ransacked by the mischievous mice in "The 
Tale of Two Bad Mice." They can also explore a child-size house with vegetables 
on the table, dishes in the cupboard and aprons and bonnets on the hooks. 
</P>
<P>
 In an adjacent room, children can fish in Jeremy Fisher's pond (the bait and 
fish have Velcro stitched on them). They can hold live rabbits and watch a 
family of mice scamper about in a mouse house. They can also dress up as Peter 
Rabbit or one of his pals, but they might be upstaged by an adult-sized Peter 
who roams the auditorium giving hugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit isn't just for kids. Potter, who created Peter Rabbit about a 
hundred years ago, led an extraordinary life, and it's all part of the exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in 1866 to a strict upper-middle-class family in England, she was raised 
in near isolation by nannies and tutors. She turned to art, stories and nature 
for fun. 
</P>
<P>
 She was so restricted by her parents that she kept a diary in code from the 
time she was 14 until she was 30. It wasn't until 1958 that someone finally 
cracked it. 
</P>
<P>
 The code is part of the museum's exhibit. It's been programmed into a 
computer, and using an electronic mouse, kids can try to crack the jumbled 
letters and decipher a message. 
</P>
<P>
 (The museum is at 2559 Puesta del Sol Road, Santa Barbara. Admission is $5 for 
adults, $4 for seniors and teen-agers, $3 for children 2 to 12, children under 
2 free. For information: 682-4711.) 
</P>

<P>
 Looking for a way to cool off? Lake Piru east of Fillmore allows public 
swimming during the summer until Oct. 1. In fact, it's the only freshwater spot 
in the county where you can take a dip. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week the water was a toasty 78 degrees, and it's very likely to stay 
fairly warm through September, according to manager Doug West. But you can't 
just dive in wherever you feel like it. 
</P>
<P>
 Swimmers are restricted to a roped-off area at the north end of the lake, 
about two miles from the entrance. The spot is about 100 yards wide and 50 
yards out into the water -- far enough to be over your head. 
</P>
<P>
 You can swim daily from sunup to sunset, but a lifeguard is only on duty on 
weekends and major holidays from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, and expect some company. West said that on a busy day, 200 to 300 swimmers 
take the plunge. 
</P>
<P>
 (Lake Piru is east of Fillmore off California 126. Cost per day is $5 per 
vehicle, plus another $5 if you bring a boat. For information: 521-1500.) 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Here's another way to beat the heat. Conejo Valley Ice Skating Center in 
Newbury Park expands its public skating hours during the summer to give kids a 
chance to cruise the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 The hours, in effect until Sept. 11, are: Monday through Friday, 12:30 to 3 
p.m.; Saturday and Sunday from 1:30 to 3:30 p.m., and Wednesday, Friday and 
Saturday nights from 8 to 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission is $6.25 for adults and $5 for kids 12 and under. Skate rental is 
$2. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a tip from rink employee Mike Howard: Dress warmly, even though it may 
be a scorcher outside, because the temperature inside is only about 50 degrees. 
Gloves or mittens are a good idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's another tip: Watch for the opening of a new ice rink in Simi Valley 
about the end of September. 
</P>
<P>
 (Conejo Valley Ice Skating Center is at 510 N. Ventu Park Road. For 
information: 498-6669. 
</P>

<P>
 If you haven't made it to the Ventura County Fair by now, it's not too late. 
In fact, the rodeo will be going on at the fairgrounds Friday, Saturday and 
Sunday. (Fair admission gets you into the rodeo free.) 
</P>
<P>
 This is traditional rodeo stuff -- calf-roping, steer-wrestling, bull-riding, 
barrel racing -- all put on by the Professional Rodeo Cowboys' Assn. It's doing 
five shows this year: Friday at 7 p.m., and Saturday and Sunday, 2 and 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all of it will be standard ride 'em cowboy fare. A new act this year 
sounds intriguing. Pro cowboy Tommy Lucia will be showing off the dancing 
skills of his trained horse, In His Glory, a swayback horse he rescued from an 
uncertain fate. Lucia also has a monkey he has trained to ride a sheep dog 
while the dog herds sheep into a pen. 
</P>
<P>
 (The fair runs from 11 a.m. to midnight daily, through Sunday. For 
information: 648-3376) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Those child-size Alphabet Soup Puppets will be back on stage Saturday at the 
Camarillo Art Center. Puppeteer Arla Crane will do a show based on Chumash and 
other American Indian folk tales. Then she'll run a puppet workshop in which 
the children will make a puppet from the play. 
</P>
<P>
 The show-workshop (for ages 4 to 8 years) begins at 11 a.m. at the center, 
3150 Ponderosa Drive. Admission is $3 at the door. Adults are free. For 
information: 445-7061.

THEATER REVIEW; PLAY PUTS BARD'S TALE IN NEW ERA; SPRIGHTLY, STYLISH PRODUCTION 
PLACES 'LOVE'S LABOUR'S LOST' IN EDWARDIAN TIMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Not that Shakespeare is ever a cakewalk, but 'Love's Labour's Lost' is a 
particularly tough nut to crack. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the Shakespearean comedies, it's the one most narrowly focused on 
Elizabethan topical parody and nuances of language, and almost entirely 
sidesteps the Bard's usual complicated plot formulas. With no magical fairies, 
perplexing twins or cross dressers to supply the nonverbal inanity, the play 
can, indeed, make for a long evening of lost labors. 
</P>
<P>
 All the more reason to applaud PCPA Theaterfest's bright and witty staging, 
which breathes sprightly elegance into the tale of headstrong, ambitious youth 
taught a lesson by life experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Paul Barnes' decision to reset the story in Edwardian times is far 
from an arbitrary conceit -- there are intriguing parallels between the giddy 
optimism of the 1920s and the smug complacency with which Shakespeare's quartet 
of young aristocrats view themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 When the boyish King Ferdinand (Jack Greenman) enlists his three schoolmates 
in a three-year pledge of intellectual contemplation, withdrawal from secular 
pursuits and celibacy, it's an ideal of isolationism not unlike the way 
post-World War I European society turned a blind eye to the realities that 
would soon overwhelm it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Shakespeare's four nobles, however, the bursting of their 
artificial bubble comes not from political or economic pressures but from 
hormonal ones. 
</P>
<P>
 It takes only the arrival of a French Princess (Lisa Paulsen) and her trio of 
ladies to have each of the four young men secretly scheming to renege on his 
oath of abstinence. 
</P>
<P>
 As Berowne, the most adept of the foursome at verbal backpedaling, Frederic 
Barbour proves hilarious in his speeches of convoluted logic, wordplay and 
sustained paradox. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the play is concerned with language -- its power and its limitations 
-- and Barnes' direction punches the specialized wordplay with broad, 
demonstrative characterizations from his performers. 
</P>
<P>
 The show-stealer is Gregg Coffin as the prissy, aristocratic Spaniard Don 
Adriano de Armado, rendered with an affectedly stiff poise and an ear for 
mispronunciation that rivals Mrs. Malaprop. 
</P>
<P>
 As always, Shakespeare's women have the emotional upper hand, and Paulsen's 
Princess, abetted by Karen Barbour's outrageous Rosaline, make short work of 
the males' feeble pretenses and defenses. As Berowne admits in one of his 
ruminations, he has fallen in love with Rosaline, and all the sophistry in his 
lexicon can't change the fact that he's at the mercy of his feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 In tackling the play's most problematic aspect -- its atypically downbeat and 
unresolved ending -- the production doesn't shy away from the darker elements, 
but like so many stagings before, it makes the optimistic assumption that the 
couples will reunite after their year of separation. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the story's consistent use of harsh realism to wash away romantic 
illusions, however, it's not an outcome that should be taken for granted.

MUSIC; SHE'S TAKING PAIN AND HER PIANO ON THE ROAD; TORI AMOS IS TOURING TO 
PROMOTE HER SECOND ALBUM. SHE TALKS ABOUT WHAT'S REALLY 'UNDER THE PINK.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Tori Amos, the Princess of Pain on Piano, will fill the Arlington Theater in 
Santa Barbara on Sunday night. Amos, with the Peg Bundy red hair and a much 
stronger work ethic, is touring in support of her second album, "Under the 
Pink." 
</P>
<P>
 Born Myra Ellen Amos on Aug. 22, 1963, to a strict Methodist minister in North 
Carolina, she was a child prodigy on piano. Writing songs at 4 when most other 
girls were going through their Barbie phase, Amos received a musical 
scholarship to the Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore at age 5. Kicked out for 
the inevitable creative differences at age 11, she toured piano bars in 
Washington and Baltimore, playing old standards for old geezers. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, she tried the rock star thing in L.A. for a few years, released a rock 
album that flopped in 1988, then moved to England. Her "Little Earthquakes" 
album in 1992, went gold, garnering all sorts of complimentary adjectives from 
the press, heavy rotation on MTV and a bushel of fawning fans who hang on every 
word in lieu of hanging themselves. Her bio speaks of "outrage and sensuality," 
"oppression and self-liberation" and "innocence and experience." Amos spoke for 
herself during a recent phone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 So you've been playing as much as those old blues dudes? 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight I'm doing my sixth show in a row, and my 109th show since February. 
I'll be touring until Christmas, then after that, I dunno. 
</P>
<P>
 Did it blow your mind to turn 30, and also, are you going to play on your 
birthday this year? 
</P>
<P>
 I'm going to be 31, and I'm in the best place I've ever been in my life. I'm 
feeling very independent, and that's a very strong feeling. I'm not playing on 
my birthday this year, but I have before. 
</P>
<P>
 Who goes to a Tori Amos show, a lot of serious women in black? 
</P>
<P>
 No, not just them; everybody goes. It's pretty equal between men and women. 
</P>
<P>
 I read this interview you did in BAM and the guy ended up talking twice as 
much as you did. What's up with that? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, sometimes, that's how it works. I've done these things before. Sometimes 
I even get a new question. 
</P>
<P>
 Do guys try to hit on you after the show? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course they do, but it's not a problem. My fans are different. It's more of 
a respect thing -- they respect me and I respect them. If a guy brings me 
flowers, I look at it as a token of respect. 
</P>
<P>
 On your "God" song, you suggest the Almighty needs a female co-pilot. So 
you're saying God is not a woman? 
</P>
<P>
 I'm talking about the Christian conception of God, and he's definitely a male. 
If anyone ever studied Christian mythology, it's pretty obvious that God 
doesn't lactate, and you can see that this is a patriarchy. He definitely needs 
a babe to give him some advice. Hey, I got no problems giving him advice. 
</P>
<P>
 No band, it's just you and a piano on the road? 
</P>
<P>
 Look, I make a lot of money and I could afford a band. But if I had a band, 
every show would be the same, and I improvise every show. Unless you've had 
players you've been with for a long time, when you improvise, it's a bleeping 
train wreck -- that's what it's going to be 95% of the time. With a band, you 
have to be very rehearsed, and you can't add anything at the spur of the 
moment. 
</P>
<P>
 What do you expect people to get from one of your shows? 
</P>
<P>
 A sense of freedom. You guys in the press get jaded by talking to all these 
rock stars, but for me, playing is just part of the gig. You're either a road 
dog or you're not. I mean, Metallica doesn't have to be out there, but they 
are. Plus, I have a nine-foot piano and none of them have anything that big. 
I'm not doing this for the money, it goes beyond that. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there anything distinctly Southern about your music? 
</P>
<P>
 The romanticism in general, I think, because there was something until just 
recently that was Southern about sitting on the porch smelling the honeysuckle, 
drinking some tea with some mint in it. There's something very much Southern in 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 How did you like living in L.A.? 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. was a trip, all right. I went through my band phase and learned how to 
tease my hair. I was there 6 1/2 years, which was long enough. I moved to 
England because no one wanted to know about me in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 You have Trent Reznor from Nine Inch Nails on your album, harmonizing quite 
sweetly and not screaming. Won't that spoil his image? 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't just scream all the time. Trent's a very deep cat. 
</P>
<P>
 Can music change the world? 
</P>
<P>
 If the world wants to be changed, it can be. But I think it's a bit arrogant 
to try to change people without respecting their opinions. 
</P>
<P>
 What's most misunderstood about you? 
</P>
<P>
 That I'm depressed. 
</P>
<P>
 The bio sheet for your first album was quite elaborate, while the new one is 
merely a single sheet. Why? 
</P>
<P>
 I told them the sophomore record would have to stand on its own without a lot 
of hype. Of course, they listened to me. We have a very clear relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Do redheads have more fun? 
</P>
<P>
 I dunno. I'm a dyed redhead. Details

RESTAURANT REVIEW; FUN OF KOREAN DINING IS IN THE VARIETY; THE SIMI EATERY

AND PUNGENT SEAFOOD.

 Because confession cleanses the soul, I will confess to being a Korean food 
lover. I travel down to L.A.'s Koreatown on Sunday mornings to devour steaming 
casseroles of tofu . . . drop into tiny Korean barbecue spots where I emerge 
with every pore reeking of wood smoke . . . and I even enjoy poking around 
Korean supermarkets, where much of the food for sale is positively 
unidentifiable. 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the Asian cuisines that have taken root on these shores, I feel that 
Korean food is the most misunderstood. Some folks mistakenly believe that every 
dish in the repertory is drenched in either garlic, hot pepper or both. Others 
erroneously assume that it's all barbecued meats, often cooked on a grill at 
your table. 
</P>
<P>
 The best of Korean cuisine also includes wonderful rice soup, toothsome 
dumplings, hearty casseroles, incredible seafood dishes and irresistible noodle 
concoctions along with an infinite variety of marinated vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be dissuaded by the name of Oak's Korean B.B.Q. The restaurant in a Simi 
Valley mini-mall serves more than just grilled items, and the food is as good 
as or better than most places in Koreatown. 
</P>
<P>
 This brightly lit storefront spot contains roomy leather booths with grills 
built into the tables, and overhead metal air ducts to draw up the smoke. The 
congenial servers are all the siblings of the Yi family, and their parents do 
the cooking chores. 
</P>
<P>
 After ordering an icy Korean beer, I start with deep-fried mushrooms ($3) and 
squash ($3) and a small order of tempura-like shrimp and vegetables ($5). The 
batter is thick, airy and greaseless, giving each of these morsels a nice 
crunch. Another good starter is a tasty stir-fry of shredded beef, carrots, 
bean sprouts and rice noodles. 
</P>
<P>
 When our evenings cool down, you'll enjoy the huge bowl of rice porridge soup 
with tender beef dumplings ($7.50) subtly flavored with ginger, beef and 
scallion, making the concoction one of the great comfort foods of all time. Or 
you might try the spicy shredded beef soup ($7.95) or the equally hearty beef 
rib soup ($8.95). But the peppery broth with chunks of snapper ($9.95) lacks 
the gutsy flavor of the other soups. 
</P>
<P>
 By this time, the server has spread out a beautiful complimentary palette of 
small dishes of tangy kim chee (pickled cabbage), marinated turnips, spinach in 
sesame oil, bean sprouts, baby fish strands in sweet sauce, sliced omelet and 
pickled zucchini. Just the soup and condiments can make a satisfying light 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 I keep my eyes focused closely on the thinly sliced beef ($10.95), marinated 
in sesame oil and herbs, because it cooks very quickly on my lighted table 
grill. (I once got into a heated political discussion with my table companions 
and burned half my meal.) After the beef is grilled to my liking, I place it in 
a crisp leaf of romaine, add some rice, a slice or two of fresh garlic (grilled 
along with the beef), and a tasty sauce similar to hoisin. Then I fold it like 
a burrito and enjoy. 
</P>
<P>
 Or you can swap the beef for julienned slices of pork ($10.95) or chicken 
($10.95) . Sometimes I add some of the tableside marinated vegetables. This is 
the fun of Korean dining: The food combination permutations seem endless. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbecued shrimp ($10.95) are nicely grilled but oddly bland. Conversely, the 
panbroiled squid ($9.50) are deliciously cooked with chilies, onions and 
broccoli, while the panbroiled eel ($13.95) is grilled with a delicate sweet 
sesame sauce that offsets the richness of the eel. 
</P>
<P>
 Served for two or more is the winning broiled mixed seafood ($22), a 
gargantuan caldron of clams, shrimp, squid, crab, snapper and scallops in an 
herb-scented broth. 
</P>
<P>
 Through all of my Korean restaurant experiences, I've learned that dessert is 
not a major part of the dining vocabulary. Here, as in most places, you receive 
sticks of chewing gum, which holds my sweet tooth at bay until I can drive to 
the nearest ice cream parlor. Details

 Chef Nicola Rossetto of the Pastabilities Restaurant in Westlake Village was 
quite serious about the authenticity of his Italian menu. In fact, he was so 
serious that the native of Venice, Italy, returned home in search of recipes. 
</P>
<P>
 And not just any Italian recipes. Venetian recipes. 
</P>
<P>
 "My partner went back in June and returned about three weeks ago," said 
Giovanni Tromba, owner of Pastabilities and three other Ventura County 
eateries. "If you go to Venice today, you will eat the same type of food you 
will eat at the restaurant, the same identical dishes," he said. "It's how we 
blend the herbs. In the pesto sauce we blend three types of basil." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the items on the new menu, introduced last week, are a gnocchi dish 
prepared with king crab meat, a light tomato sauce, olive oil, garlic and three 
kinds of herbs; and a farfalle al salmone affumicato -- smoked Alaskan salmon 
with dill, a touch of champagne and a little cream. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the change in foods, Tromba said, the restaurant will be adding 
a change in ambience. Beginning Sept. 7 there will be light jazz performed 
Wednesday and Thursday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastabilities is located at 900 Hampshire Road, Suite X. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It began simply enough, on a Saturday evening about a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Bartender Mark "Brooklyn" Brockway of Ventura's Rosarito Beach Cafe brought in 
some CDs to play while on duty -- just as he always does. On this night, in 
particular, he cranked up some Otis Redding and James Brown. And Saturday 
night's haven't been the same since. 
</P>
<P>
 "James Brown got everybody going," said Sandy Smith, Rosarito's owner and 
chef. "We put the music on a little later in the evening and found that people 
were hanging out and standing around the bar a little later." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith hardly needed a marketing degree to realize the significance of that. So 
now every Saturday night is James Brown Night, beginning at around 9:15. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's only half the story. 
</P>
<P>
 James Brown Night provided the impetus for a larger change in the restaurant's 
late-night schedule. "This has set the wheels in motion for an after-hours 
bistro, Fridays and Saturdays between 10 p.m. and midnight. We'll do a limited 
menu, cocktails and cappuccinos," said Smith. "We're almost in place." He said 
to expect a formal opening within a couple of weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosarito Beach Cafe is at 692 E. Main St.

MOST LIKELY TO SECEDE; IF NOTHING ELSE, JACKSON BROWNE'S ORANGE COUNTY DAYS 
GAVE HIM A PLACE TO MOVE AWAY FROM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jackson Browne arrived reluctantly in Fullerton at age 12, and left eagerly at 
17. 
</P>
<P>
 In between, he earned a superfluous diploma, class of 1966, while nursing a 
general, but not absolute, loathing for Sunny Hills High School. 
</P>
<P>
 In the eyes of Clyde J. Browne, as he is listed in a yearbook that notes no 
clubs, no activities, no honors, nothing at all beneath his name, the 
conservative, affluent school was being run to stifle the '60s, to keep out any 
whiff of the excitement and change that the era's most aware and creative 
teen-agers strained to sniff. Sunny Hills' purpose, he felt, was to uphold a 
tidy Orange County vision of clean-cut appearances and straight, unquestioning 
right-thinking -- something it accomplished with considerable success. 
</P>
<P>
 But Browne, who ranks with James Taylor and Joni Mitchell as one of leaders of 
the '70s singer-songwriter movement, also found what he needed during his 
Orange County days, and they were things that young artists acquire early in 
life only if they are lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a close circle of creative, supportive friends and family, who 
inspired him to become a songwriter at age 15, and who remain his friends 
today. There were clubs, the famous Golden Bear in Huntington Beach, but 
especially the Paradox, a tiny but adventurously run coffeehouse in Orange, 
where he could listen to touring folk music heroes and step on stage to develop 
his own songs and gather experience and confidence as he pursued a calling that 
he knew by his mid-teens would be his career. And there was Sunny Hills High 
School, and all the conservative suburban expanse around it. A young artist 
needs something to rebel against, and in that regard, Fullerton proved to be 
just the right place for Jackson Browne. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had an attitude about that school, and I could still work up an attitude 
about the kind of education I got there," Browne said last week in a phone 
interview. He was in a hotel in Dallas on a tour that brings him to Irvine 
Meadows on Saturday. "I thought it was close-minded and oppressive, and they 
missed the opportunity to teach." 
</P>
<P>
 But as he looked back on his Orange County days, Browne was not inclined to 
work up an attitude. At 45, he is more likely to chuckle over his school days 
than to rail about them. Frequently punctuating his talk with laughter, he 
viewed his Orange County days with equanimity, and confessed that he now feels 
a certain fondness when he remembers people he once scorned. 
</P>
<P>
 Browne says he hated it when his parents, Jack and Bea Browne, moved their 
three children from the old Los Angeles suburb of Highland Park to a house on 
the edge of the new Sunny Hills subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was popped down in a sort of very sterile tract-home community. I sort of 
had contempt for the entire decision to move there. They sort of bamboozled me 
by saying it was near Disneyland, but I didn't have any choice in the matter." 
</P>
<P>
 The typically suburban house on Brookdale Place was no match for the Browne 
family's previous digs: a remarkable homestead of adobe, brick and stone that 
Browne's grandfather had built with his own hands and dubbed the Abbey San 
Encino. (The future singing star was named Clyde after his grandfather, but was 
known from boyhood by his middle name, Jackson.) The house, which still remains 
in the family, was patterned after an old Spanish mission and featured an inner 
courtyard with a fountain that Browne used as the setting for the cover of his 
second album, "For Everyman." 
</P>
<P>
 It was partly Browne's own doing that his parents decided to abandon the 
character of Highland Park for the security of Fullerton. Browne says they were 
worried that he and his older sister, Roberta (known as Berbie to family and 
friends), were getting caught up in a rough, gang-oriented crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "For two or three years before moving to Orange County, I was hanging around 
the public playgrounds and underneath the railroad trestle hearing tales about 
the California Youth Authority and the penal system," Browne recalled. "I met 
guys all the time that probably came out of juvenile programs (and) from Y.A. 
(that) Highland Park was almost like a no-man's land, a battle ground between 
the Chicano gangs and the white gangs. Me and my friends were (racially) mixed, 
but the prevailing neighborhood style and attitudes were Chicano. We weren't 
gang members, but nearly everybody we knew were in gangs." 
</P>
<P>
 Browne's younger brother, Severin, remembers one show of street credibility by 
Jackson: when some older kids from Jackson's junior high school picked on 
Severin, he went to his brother, who apparently engaged in some big-stick 
schoolboy diplomacy. Severin says that the next time the bigger kids saw him, 
they apologized profusely for any previous misunderstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson Browne says the family moved soon after his father found that he had 
been carrying around some of the implements of street combat, a dog chain and a 
straight-edge razor. "They were doing the straight-arrow thing to keep us from 
becoming . . . I guess they thought we were at risk," Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
 He carried one indelible sign of his L.A. County street days with him to 
Orange County: shortly before the move, he used a needle and ink to cut a 
tattoo of a dagger into his arm. "I have a tattoo artist friend in New York who 
wants to cover it with something (more artistic)," Browne said with a laugh. 
"But it's almost like a birthmark. It's me, and it's not bad, as a matter of 
fact." 
</P>
<P>
 Browne enrolled in the eighth grade at Fullerton's Wilshire Junior High School 
in 1961, and soon made his first friend: Erich Brown, with whom he shared a 
homonymous name and new-kid status -- Erich had just moved to Fullerton from 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody pretty much looked the same except for him," recalled Brown, now an 
architect in Santa Barbara County. "He was still dressed like a kid from East 
L.A. He had khaki chino pants, and his hair in a 'do. Everyone else was pretty 
conservative." 
</P>
<P>
 The friendship centered on surfing, a new sport for Browne that he took to 
readily, and playing the guitar, something he had begun to dabble in back in 
Highland Park. Browne had also taken three years of trumpet lessons and played 
in school orchestras in Highland Park. He had wanted to switch to the piano, 
but his father refused. Jack Browne, a pianist who played Dixieland jazz in his 
spare time, felt that his son had promise as a trumpet player and insisted that 
he stick to that (the elder Browne made his living as a printer and a high 
school English and journalism teacher -- including a year at Sunny Hills in 
1961-62, the year before Jackson enrolled). 
</P>
<P>
 During his first few years in Fullerton, Browne in some ways lived the life of 
a typical, early-'60s Orange County kid. With his friend Erich, he would work 
out the guitar licks to surf-rock classics like Dick Dale's "Miserlou" and 
"Pipeline" by the Chantays. Together, they would go to the local surf-dances at 
the Rendezvous Ballroom in Balboa, the Fullerton Teen Center, and Harmony Park 
in Anaheim. As a freshman, Browne joined the Sunny Hills wrestling team, 
competing at about 100 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The next year, "in a fantastic display of bad judgment, I went out for 
football. It was a sort of heavy lesson. I had no appreciation for the game, no 
desire to be there, and I began cutting practice right away. The joke is that I 
loved the coach. Coach (Wayne) Payne was really a good guy, less a sort of 
barking sergeant. He was built like a fireplug, but he was nice, he had a 
humane streak in him." Browne would round out his schoolboy athletic career by 
running on the cross-country team. But the sophomore year that had begun with a 
feeble attempt at football ended with him having committed himself to a lasting 
vocation as a singer-songwriter. 
</P>
<P>
 Browne's musical mentors were Steve Noonan and Greg Copeland, Sunny Hills 
students two years ahead of him. Noonan, who went on to record an album for 
Elektra in 1968, was a charismatic performer and sharp guitar player, and the 
acknowledged leader of a small coterie of Sunny Hills folk musicians. Copeland 
was his lyricist partner, a big man on campus who shocked the Sunny Hills 
Establishment by turning in his senior year from a jacket-and-tie-sporting 
student body leader and conservative polemicist for the debate team into a 
full-on lefty writing protest songs like "Progress," in praise of social 
activism, and "The Ballad of Rosa Parks," an ode to the first heroine of the 
civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Browne's own earliest efforts tended to be about his girlfriends (friends say 
he had no steady flame during high school). He remembers a song called "Renee" 
as being possibly his first; "Marianne" was another in that mode. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone around him in those days attests that his maturity and artistic 
intensity as a teen-aged songwriter was remarkable. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was so single-minded and focused," recalls Erich Brown. "He knew that he 
wanted to be a singer-songwriter and make his mark, and he went after that with 
a ferociousness and dedication way beyond his years." 
</P>
<P>
 "He very much got into the discipline of absorbing certain styles for his 
music and taking it seriously and being devoted to it," said Joe Romeo, a 
member of Browne's high school circle who now is a science professor and AIDS 
researcher at San Francisco State. "With a lot of the people I knew then, 
myself included, there would be a Dylan approach, or I remember at one point 
trying to sound like the New Lost City Ramblers, or trying to play just like 
Mississippi John Hurt. But Jackson had a center even then. He had some sort of 
inner idea, an inner ear he was trying to satisfy." 
</P>
<P>
 Browne says he would write songs mainly at his kitchen table, late at night, 
or in his bedroom. One that popped out was "These Days," a world-weary song of 
regrets that remains one of his finest. Browne says he wrote it at 16 -- a 
mighty precocious age to write a lyric bearing as much weight of responsibility 
as the song's concluding line: "Don't confront me with my failures, I had not 
forgotten them."  
</P>
<P>
 Browne said he had been reading "Lust For Life," Irving Stone's novel based on 
the life of Vincent van Gogh, in which the tormented painter was said to be 
seeking a place where he would not be confronted with his failures. "That had a 
resonance with me, and it found its way into my song." 
</P>
<P>
 Browne's friend Noonan led him into public performance. His first gigs were at 
the Aware, an informal Long Beach hangout run by Noonan's father, where Browne 
played primarily for an audience of his friends. Browne cites the Paradox as 
the most important venue in his early development (it also was the club where 
the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band first gathered a following; Browne was a member for 
several months during 1966, playing washtub bass, guitar and kazoo in a 
lighthearted jug-band format before moving to L.A. to launch his professional 
songwriting career). 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a really unusual club, next to a 7-11, no bigger than a medium-sized 
pet shop," Browne recalled, contrasting the musically ambitious Paradox with 
commercial coffeehouses of the time that would book slick Kingston Trio 
knockoffs or trivial folkie-comedians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their little ad in the paper and their little card said, 'Traditional music 
for contemporary minds.' (Owners Bob Sheffer and Hank Fischer) were both music 
freaks. They'd book Jack Elliott, Sonny Terry and Brownie McGhee and Hoyt Axton 
(the club also booked comedians Steve Martin and Pat Paulsen, and the 
soon-to-be-acclaimed Orange County singer, Tim Buckley). I became part of a 
scene on Thursday nights where people were standing up and singing their own 
music. We sort of filtered down through all the (bull) of what we considered a 
sort of plastic and superficial kind of culture and sifted down to the real 
thing, blues and folk music, and people singing songs about what mattered." 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer, now a businessman in Yorba Linda, recalls that Browne needed some 
extra prodding before his first gig: "He was sitting in what we called the 
warm-up room, kind of behind the stage, out of view, and he was getting cold 
feet: 'I can't do it, I just can't do it.' I'm about six-foot-two, and I just 
kind of intimidated him. I kind of glared at him, and he did it. He did just 
fine, and there was never any more trouble after that." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning he was a shy kid, not a dynamic performer," recalls Noonan, 
now a stockbroker in Los Angeles. "But people would wait around for Jackson's 
new song." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Romeo remembers that Browne, during his earliest days, "definitely got 
very tense before concerts. At the Aware, there would be the quaver in the 
voice, he would just be tight. Jackson can be just really funny. He's got a 
natural sense of humor, and had great timing, even then. We'd get each other in 
hysterics. But when Jackson would get up on stage, the timing was off and he 
would be a little stiff. It took him a while to get used to playing in front of 
crowds. It's something he had to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most important havens and nurturing grounds for the small group of 
Sunny Hills folkies and political activists were the Browne family's houses -- 
first the Brookdale Place home, then a more modest one on Orange Avenue, behind 
a Lucky's market. Jack and Bea Browne separated when Jackson was 14, and Bea 
Browne, who taught English at Buena Park High School, moved with her kids to 
humbler quarters (Browne's parents both died in the late 1980s). 
</P>
<P>
 "Bea was everybody's mom, a cross between a mom and a hotelier," recalls 
Copeland, who recorded a well-received 1982 album produced by Browne, "Revenge 
Will Come," but is now a securities lawyer in Los Angeles. "It was a real open 
house. They were the quintessential outsider family. There was an acceptance 
there that was very hard to find in other houses -- acceptance of teen-agers 
going through whatever teen-agers go through." 
</P>
<P>
 Drug experimentation was part of what Browne and his friends went through, 
although they tried to hide that '60s rite of passage from his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not just wild and crazy times at Ridgemont High or anything like 
that," recalled Romeo. "(Mrs. Browne) was tolerant of curiosity, 
experimentation and an open outlook on things, even if she didn't agree with 
(something) herself. There was a sense of freedom that was unique. You felt you 
were dealing with somebody reasonable and intelligent." 
</P>
<P>
 In class, Browne frequently found himself chafing at what he saw as a lack of 
those qualities. The outspokenness that would later make him known as one of 
pop's most active backers of liberal causes (from no-nukes protests to opposing 
U.S. policy in Central America) was already evident during his years at Sunny 
Hills High. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember getting in big arguments and philosophical discussions with my 
teachers about the Free Speech Movement (the radical student movement at UC 
Berkeley that ignited a national wave of '60s campus protest). I had a big 
(verbal) fight, I got myself thrown out of a social studies class in which the 
teacher was simply saying, 'To begin with, they're crazy.' He was talking about 
Mario Savio, the firebrand of that movement, and I raised my hand and said, 
'Well, why do you say that, Mr. Vanderbilt?' He said, 'Well, just look at him,' 
and he got really kind of aggravated: 'Just look at him!' And I said, 'Well, 
yeah, what about it?' He began to condemn him for having a problem with his 
hair and for what amounted to being impassioned. In a way, I shut my books, and 
just said, 'If you're going to try to tell me that these people are simply 
insane, and that's the full extent of your explanation about what's happening 
in Berkeley, then I can't take your word about any of this other stuff.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In another class, Browne found himself having to defend the civil rights 
movement. "The community was racist. I had these stand-up debates in class 
about racism. And it would come down to, 'OK, Jackson, it's all very well for 
you to espouse these liberal viewpoints about civil rights, but what if your 
sister went out with one?' " At this, Browne would rebut his incredulous debate 
opponent by saying that she did. Along with Browne's friend, Greg Copeland, 
Berbie Browne had enrolled at San Francisco State in 1964, and was dating a 
black musician. Jackson and his friends back in Orange County began making 
regular hitchhiking treks and vacation excursions to San Francisco, with its 
social and political tumult. 
</P>
<P>
 Browne particularly bridled at Sunny Hills' strict dress code, with its limits 
on hair length and penalties for such infractions as an untucked shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wrote a poem for the school newspaper about the dress code being too 
restrictive. It was not abrasive or anything, but it didn't get printed. It was 
such a rigged thing. It was a particularly repressive and restrictive mentality 
in that school. Nonetheless, half a dozen teachers that I remember were 
absolutely great. Wanda Jacobs, Mrs. Randolph, and there was quite a good art 
teacher too, I can't remember his name. I had a speech class, one of the 
coolest classes you could take, because the teacher, Mr. Wood, was a total 
hipster in disguise. You look at them now, and they were human beings who were 
all trying to figure out how to pass something of importance on. So I liked 
about half my teachers, but disagreed with the structure of things." 
</P>
<P>
 Browne says he was not the sort of rebel who would go out of his way to break 
rules and defy the structure. "I thought that was a waste of time, to sit there 
and talk with the boys' vice principal. It's funny, I have a kind of tender 
spot for all these people now. At the time, I just didn't have any patience for 
it. But I just thought there were better things to do than argue about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Browne's friend, Joe Romeo, says their circle became branded as outcasts: "We 
were not a popular little clique at Sunny Hills. I think we were actually a 
little notorious for being malcontents. We had much-inflated reputations for 
being involved in shady activities. Looking back, we were so wholesome, but we 
thought we were being such rebels. Our schoolmates saw us as being involved in 
dangerous activities." 
</P>
<P>
 There were some consequences. Copeland's socialite girlfriend dumped him when 
she learned he'd been singing protest songs in a park with Noonan, Browne and 
the rest of their set. And Romeo says that a Fullerton judge warned his 
girlfriend's mother "that she was in danger being involved with me, because I 
was hanging out with Jackson Browne, and his house was a hotbed of hippie 
activity, and his house was being watched by the police." Romeo said that bit 
of information only made him "more fascinating" to his girlfriend, and they 
later were married. (They've since divorced.) 
</P>
<P>
 Erich Brown remembers his friend Jackson being unfazed by pressures to 
conform. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pulled over a number of times by the police with him. We used to get 
hassled all the time because our hair was long. He just wasn't afraid of them 
or the situation. He seemed pretty fearless about most things. It was a 
combination of his drive to have a career and the street sense he picked up (in 
Highland Park)." 
</P>
<P>
 Browne left Orange County soon after graduating from high school, although he 
would return often during the late '60s and early '70s to play at clubs like 
the Golden Bear and the Four Muses in San Clemente. He says it was less a 
matter of hating Orange County than of knowing that Los Angeles (and, for a 
time in 1967, New York) was the place to launch a songwriter's career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked Orange County," Browne said. "But maybe there was a prevalent 
attitude of 'Get me out of here.' We joked about the 'Orange Curtain,' about 
how bereft of any kind of culture Orange County was. Nonetheless, I have fond 
memories of people there, and I think there's some surprising things beneath 
the surface of every place. I think to be a progressive person in Orange County 
took more commitment. We were talking about getting freaked, of having long 
hair or espousing radical political beliefs, and it took more commitment in 
Orange County than, say, in Hollywood. At the same time, I began going to 
Hollywood (to perform) in my senior year and probably spent every weekend there 
and met new friends. I got a manager the summer after high school, and got a 
publishing deal with a record company. Most of what was going on in terms of 
the music business was in Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 By 1968, Browne was getting attention as artists such as Tom Rush, Nico and 
the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band began covering his material. When he emerged, in 
1972, with his own album, "Saturate Before Using," he was instantly recognized 
as one of the era's preeminent singer-songwriters. 
</P>
<P>
 After Browne had become prominent in the '70s via such widely heard songs as 
"Doctor My Eyes," "Rock Me on the Water," "Take It Easy" and "Redneck Friend," 
Julie Ritner Simpson, a Sunny Hills English teacher who had been one of his 
favorites, made a tentative approach to bring him back to the school for a 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, who still teaches at Sunny Hills, got the impression that "he didn't 
want to have anything to do with Sunny Hills." Around that time, she says, she 
took an entire honors class to see Browne play at a local college. "I recall 
him making some kind of disparaging remarks about high school and Fullerton." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think somebody might have sounded me out about coming and doing an assembly 
or something," Browne said. "I remember thinking that it wasn't something I 
wanted to do at the time." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, Sunny Hills began to honor distinguished alumni by placing their 
names on plaques set in a "Walk of Fame" outside the campus administration 
building. "I think I submitted (Browne's) name," Simpson recalls, "but he 
didn't get elected." 
</P>
<P>
 Is there any lasting lore about Jackson Browne at Sunny Hills High? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, unfortunately," Simpson said. A few years ago, when an alumnus from the 
'60s was visiting her class, "In talking to the kids, he said something about 
Jackson Browne. They had typical blank looks on their faces. They had no idea 
who he was, which was really disheartening to me. It's not like Gary Carter 
(the former baseball star, Sunny Hills '72, who is among the 10 alumni honored 
with plaques at the school)." 
</P>
<P>
 Browne says he doesn't crave recognition by his old school. But as the years 
went by, he said, he always wanted to attend the reunions of the Class of 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't hold the people I went to school with responsible for the kind of 
school it was," he said. "I was interested in seeing and meeting the people I 
hadn't seen in many years." Musical commitments always got in the way, Browne 
said, until 1991, when he turned up at the Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim for his 
25-year reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a great time. Some people I considered to be in opposing camps 
culturally and politically seemed to me to have really grown and matured. 
Everybody grows. Everybody has a chance to, anyway." MORE POP

WANNA DANCE?: SPEND AN EVENING IN SUEDE SURROUNDINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES, Rose Apodaca Jones is a free-lance writer who 
contributes regularly to The Times Orange County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just when a club veteran in search of fresh entertainment is about to hang up 
her dancing shoes, a new dig opens that's velvety lush and swank, even if it is 
tucked into a strip mall in Orange along with a sushi bar and coffeehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit for this latest club, restaurant and billiard hall, called Suede, goes 
to owners Andy Sharifi and Mehdi and Mandi Rafaty. As architects specializing 
in interior work, the Rafaty brothers are responsible for giving the place its 
urban feel.  
</P>
<P>
 The interior strives for that '90s post-industrial look, exposed ducts and 
all. But the use of iron is not just decorative. Other than the suede seat 
cushions (if they can be called "cushions," uncomfortable as they are), the bar 
stools are a metal experiment in modern primitive. Crude but ornately cut metal 
pieces jut out of the ceiling. But despite all this metal, Suede has an overall 
warmth as a result of the burnt-orange crisscross brushwork on the walls -- 
suggesting a den covered in suede itself, especially as the night progresses 
and if you squint just right. 
</P>
<P>
 Introverts can head to the back living room area, partially partitioned off 
and filled with velvet sofas and chairs, candles and incense sticks. Sink in 
and relax, but try not to fall asleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight purple felt-topped billiard tables -- said to be modeled after those of 
the 19th Century -- dominate the rectangular space outside the living room. 
Hourly rates are $5 until 4 p.m. and $6 from 4 to 6 p.m. After 7 p.m., it's $8 
Sunday through Thursday, $10 on Friday and Saturday. An hour of free pool 
garnishes any lunch order Thursday through Sunday, noon to 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 A stage near the billiard tables showcases a mix of live bands and other 
performers. Mondays spotlight a blues or jazz combo; Tuesdays and Wednesdays 
are audition nights for amateur acts, who vie for a weekend bill. Country 
lovers can check out the club on Wednesday evenings. 
</P>
<P>
 Suede is trying out the talents of local club promoters on Saturday and Sunday 
nights. Dreamscape Productions turns Sunday into Spunday (most weeks, but call 
ahead), an 18-and-over gig. Saturday is a better bet with Chakra, hosted by 
Robert Frias and Danny Venegas (formerly of Roxbury and Metropolis). Deejay 
Dan-E controls the vibes of acid jazz, funk, techno and other assorted dance 
rhythms; a Tarot card and palm reader makes occasional appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopefully, these promoters can bring Suede the attention and crowd it 
deserves. It has all of the ingredients, but this 8-month-old club -- which is 
the kind of place that Orange County residents might normally travel to 
Hollywood for -- still lacks a regular clientele. 
</P>
<P>
 With only beer and wine available (the bar won't be fully licensed for a 
year), the Suede folks had to get creative with their drink menu. Concoctions 
include a refreshingly fruity sangria, hold the brandy, for $2. A glass of wine 
is $3.50 to $4.50; by the bottle it's $10 to $14. As for beer, the selections 
are tantalizing. On tap, choices include Guinness, Bass and Kilian's Red. 
Imports are $3.25 a glass, $7 a pitcher; domestics cost $2.25 a glass and $5 a 
pitcher. For beers by the bottle, there are 35 to choose from, ranging from 
$2.50 to $4.50.  
</P>
<P>
 The food menu offers an even greater variety -- appetizers, salads, sandwiches 
and more. The kitchen is open daily until 11 p.m., although it could probably 
do a load of business later in the night, when most patrons head off to local 
coffee shops.

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY LEWIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hal Ketchum 
</P>
<P>
 "Every Little Word" 
</P>
<P>
 Curb  
</P>
<P>
 As both vocalist and songwriter, Hal Ketchum brings heart and song craft 
together frequently. His new album holds catchy choruses and emotional punch in 
equal esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 His smoky drawl gives his songs a soulful R & B accent that has long set him 
apart from the sea of Haggard and Jones imitators. He can sound as purely 
country as any on a waltz like "No Easy Road," then turn convincingly bluesy in 
the country funk of "Drive On." 
</P>
<P>
 He stretches impressively beyond cliche in the songs he co-writes -- nine out 
of 10 here. He sings authoritatively about hitting rock bottom in "That's What 
I Get for Losin' You" ("If you think love is so sweet and kind / Just come and 
see me at closin' time)." 
</P>
<P>
 But even when he turns as brightly optimistic as he does in "(Tonight We Just 
Might) Fall in Love Again," which he wrote with ex-NRBQ mainstay Al Anderson, 
that optimism is earned, having been tempered with the experience of a real 
struggle to hold onto a love. 
</P>
<P>
 Its chorus is as catchy as they come, shifting from major-key verses to a 
chorus full of minor-key twists that finally lead back to major as he sings 
about burying the hatchet: Let's put aside the pain and all the sorrow / Stop 
talkin' 'bout the way things might have been / If we'd only throw our hearts 
into tomorrow / Tonight we just might fall in love again.  
</P>
<P>
 "Swing Low" is the type of song that Nashville studiously avoids because it 
provides no pat solutions to life's thorny problems. At the end of this song 
about a man who encounters a single mother and her baby, he says he can't get 
them out of his mind and wonders what might have been had he not gone on his 
way so soon. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a bittersweet but refreshingly real slice of life that's all too rare in 
today's formula-bound country music. RANDY LEWIS

KID STUFF: LEGACIES OF WAR, 'SONG OF HEALING'; U.S. VETERANS AND VIETNAMESE 
REFUGEES ADD THEIR VOICES TO THE HISTORY LESSONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Kid Stuff for The Times Orange County.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Almost 20 years after the fall of Saigon, United States participation in the 
Vietnam War remains a volatile subject, hotly debated by historians, 
politicians and armchair philosophers. 
</P>
<P>
 Adults may argue over the topic indefinitely, but the question remains: What 
do we tell our children about the war? 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, the Pacific Symphony Orchestra will host two events that could give 
families unique insight into the subject by better acquainting them with 
American men and women who fought in the war and the music and art of 
Vietnamese refugees who now make their home in Orange County. Both events are 
free. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday at 7:30 p.m., members of Orange County's Vietnamese community will 
perform traditional music and folk songs in a workshop with PSO musicians, PSO 
music director Carl St.Clair and New York composer Elliot Goldenthal at 
Westminster's Vietnamese American Center of Arts and Letters.  
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday at the Westin South Coast Plaza Hotel in Costa Mesa, Vietnam War 
veterans and their families will gather in an open forum, sharing letters, 
photographs, poems and personal experiences. Roxane Cohen Silver, a professor 
at UCI's School of Social Ecology who recently released a study of Vietnam 
veterans, will be the featured speaker, and Jan Allen Heath, an active 
participant in veterans' service groups, will act as moderator. 
</P>
<P>
 The programs are part of the creative process behind "A Song of Healing," the 
working title for the April, 1995, concert in which PSO will premiere 
Goldenthal's symphonic-choral work inspired by the Vietnam War, a piece that a 
PSO press release says will "address the broad feelings and emotions 
experienced by all those directly involved with the war, and those who live 
with its memories." The piece, which is not intended to make any political 
statement either for or against the war, is considered one of the few works 
that will address in music the same issues and emotions represented by the 
Vietnam Memorial in Washington, D.C., according to PSO executive director Louis 
Spisto. 
</P>
<P>
 The April 26 and 27 performances at the Orange County Performing Arts center 
fall within days of the 20th anniversary of the formal end of the war on April 
30, 1975. The piece will blend Asian and Western musical styles and will be 
performed by PSO, Pacific Chorale soloists and a children's chorus of American 
and Vietnamese American youths. 
</P>
<P>
 Khoa Le, a Vietnamese composer, photographer and television producer, is 
coordinating the Aug. 30 event. Le is a member of PSO's recently formed 
Vietnamese Advisory Committee, which includes business and community leaders 
from Westminster's Little Saigon. Le fled Vietnam in 1975 and has lived in 
Orange County with his family since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Le says he has invited Vietnamese adults and teen-agers "from all walks of 
life" to perform traditional music and folk songs at the event and encourages 
non-Vietnamese to attend. Among the traditional instruments listeners may hear 
are the dan tranh , a 16-string instrument similar to a sitar, and the dan 
nguyet , a stringed instrument "shaped like a full moon," said Le. Because it 
is part of the development process for the symphony, the event will be more 
like an informal workshop than a traditional recital, as the artists may start 
and stop their performances periodically to interact with St.Clair, Goldenthal 
and Pacific Symphony musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The father of three teen-age daughters, Le says he is disappointed by the way 
his children's textbooks and popular entertainment portray his homeland and the 
war that raged there across three decades; he considers the events on Tuesday 
and Wednesday opportunities to educate the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think most of the books and the movies expressed the war correctly, 
but I recognize that they only show (the authors') point of view," Le said. 
"Nobody can see everything."  
</P>
<P>
 Jan Heath also has a legacy of Vietnam he wants to pass on to his child. An 
engineer at Hughes Aerospace and Defense Corp., Heath was a 23-year-old 
newlywed when he was drafted into the Army and sent to Vietnam. He said his 
wartime experiences gave him a deep respect for his fellow soldiers. As founder 
of the Hughes Veterans Forum, an outreach program that aids veterans and unites 
them in community service projects, he is now committed to helping others 
recognize their contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The war is part and parcel of an era that changed an entire generation of 
American society," he said. "The legacy I would like to leave my son is that 
because of that era, his dad gained a lot of strength and talent through 
something that was extremely difficult for all concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wednesday's format is still under discussion, Heath says he expects 
veterans will be given several minutes to speak to the group. Spouses, children 
and other family members will be invited to contribute as well. Visitors should 
be aware that because of the content, there may be strong language or graphic 
imagery in some of the presentations. 
</P>
<P>
 The war "was no Sunday school picnic," observed Heath, who served as a 
rifleman. "Time has smoothed the edges a little, but it was a traumatic event, 
and there is still a lot of healing to be done."

DO IT!: SNAILS WELCOME TO KEEP PACE IN IRVINE PARK 8K 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Edition staff.

<P>
 Last year, A Snail's Pace 8K at Irvine Regional Park in Orange drew some big 
names for its initial run, including miler Steve Scott. Course records were 
established by well-known runners Anet Cooper (29 minutes, 22 seconds) and Mark 
Nenow (24:10). 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the field probably won't be as star-studded, organizers say, giving 
weekend warriors more of a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a real down-home race," said Eddie Johnson, of the 
sponsoring A Snail's Pace Running Shop in Fountain Valley. "It'll probably be a 
little less competitive than it was last year." 
</P>
<P>
 A little less competitive, perhaps, but a little more popular. Last year's 
outing drew about 300 runners, while this year's field is expected to number 
500 come Sunday at 8:30 a.m., according to Johnson. Race day registration runs 
from 7 to 8 a.m. Walkers are welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 The shop employee described the course as fast and mostly flat, with only one 
moderate climb. The course is on paved trails winding through the picturesque 
Irvine Regional Park, a tree-shaded stretch of green in the hills of east 
Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like a trail run with pavement," he said. "It's like running out 
in the woods." 
</P>
<P>
 Race director Matt Capelouto has added some new wrinkles this year, including 
prize premiums. Pink flags (for women) and blue (for men) will be posted at 
miles 2, 3 and 4. Runners who grab the flags will win a new pair of running 
shoes (one flag per runner). 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said the event poses a dilemma for leading runners -- do they slow 
down and grab a flag? Awards will be given to the top three runners in each of 
a variety of divisions (by age and gender), and other prizes will be raffled 
off. 
</P>
<P>
 A pair of new shoes will also go to the best-dressed snail. Organizers hope to 
entice some runners to compete in costume, adding a festive atmosphere to what 
is intended as a fun and scenic event. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want people to come out and have a good time," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another of Orange County's more scenic parks will be the site of a rare 
evening event, to be held Thursday, Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunset in the Park offers a pair of cross-country courses in Huntington 
Central Park, a 2.8-mile race at 6 p.m. and a 4.8-mile race at 6:30 p.m. For 
the ambitious, there's an award category for those who run both. Walkers are 
also welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 For info, call (714) 841-5417. 
</P>
<P>
 * What: A Snail's Pace 8K run/walk.

WET & WILD; AQUATICS ENTHUSIAST SINKS TO NEW LOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, David Haldane is a staff writer for The Times Orange County 
Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We begin with a warning: If you feel the least bit claustrophobic, don't try 
operating a one-man submarine. 
</P>
<P>
 There I was, embedded tight in the belly of a 4-by-10-foot mass of plastic and 
metal constituting what had been billed as the world's most accessible 
underwater craft. Lying face down, locked in as tightly as a match in a 
matchbox, I could feel the ship's walls touching my hips.  
</P>
<P>
 In a few minutes a hoist would lift the contraption with me in it off the deck 
of a jet-ski barge and into the cold water off Catalina Island. Then, operating 
with only a few clumsy controls, I would be cruising amid the kelp and fish 
beneath the surface of the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 The anticipation churned my stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the training kicked in. All 2 1/2 hours of it. I remembered my teacher's 
instructions on how to check for leaks when you first hit the water and how to 
flood the vessel's ballast tanks with seawater, beginning its slow downward 
spiral. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly there was a lurch as the hoist began its work. First I was swinging 
free, careening back and forth between the deck and the water. Then, with only 
a slight splash marking my entry into the proper element, I began my slow 
descent, sinking into the murkiness with no indication of movement except the 
agonizingly methodical climb of the needle on the depth gauge mounted in front 
of me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Give me a cabin pressure reading," cracked the voice of my instructor through 
the small speaker just inches from my ear. 
</P>
<P>
 Glancing at the proper gauges, I croaked out a series of numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Below each flood switch was a tiny dial, a twist of which would begin 
replacing the seawater in the ballast tanks with air. By carefully fiddling 
with the two sets of controls, my instructor had said, I would be able to 
regulate my buoyancy much like a diver using a buoyancy compensator; negative 
for descent, positive for ascent and somewhere in between for neutral. 
</P>
<P>
 By gripping a bar directly below and in front of me I could adjust the angle 
of my two thrusters, controlled by forward, reverse and neutral toggle switches 
mounted in a box near my left hand. And over my right shoulder to the rear was 
an oxygen intake valve by which to change the cabin pressure or atmospheric mix 
when necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 That was it; not too complicated even for a guy whose technical education 
stalled in sixth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly I felt a dull thud as my steel contraption settled on the ocean 
floor. Glancing at the gauge, I read a depth of 85 feet. All I could see 
through my window was a huge clump of fluttering kelp interspersed with fish. 
</P>
<P>
 This weird little boat, dubbed the Sea Urchin, took its maiden voyage about a 
year ago in Vancouver, Canada, where a company called Sea Urchin Inc. developed 
it for research and commercial purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Marketing experts, however, quickly realized that the new sub's simplicity and 
ease of operation might have recreational potential. So they began testing the 
market -- first in Vancouver, then in New Orleans. And last month they began 
operating the submarine under the auspices of Avalon Aquatics, a dive shop on 
Catalina Island, offering 2 1/2 hours of instruction and a half-hour 
self-guided "flight" to anyone older than 16 willing to pay $199.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to put submersibles within reach of the general public," 
explained Jonathan Council, the company's operations manager who spends most of 
his time these days on the jet-ski barge off Descanso Beach helping newly 
trained submarine pilots. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the company's agreement with the dive shop, Council said, the sub will 
stay at Catalina until about the end of September before moving on to the 
Florida Keys and, later, Hawaii. If the attraction proves popular, he said, 
Catalina will eventually have a sub of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a new experience," Council said, adding that about 27 people had piloted 
the Sea Urchin -- which weighs 1,500 pounds on land and is worth about $65,000 
-- during its first two weeks on the island. "It's not the kind of thing you 
look in the phone book for." 
</P>
<P>
 To assure the safety of first-time pilots, the sub remains on a long tether 
attached to the barge and is accompanied on each voyage by at least two safety 
divers. More than 250 trips have been logged without mishap, Council said. 
</P>
<P>
 That knowledge offered comfort while I lay bobbing on the bottom. Once I got 
the hang of it, however, no comfort was needed: There was simply no place I'd 
rather have been than down there flipping switches to turn the craft this way 
and that, left and right, up and down. 
</P>
<P>
 The view from the window, I must say, was rather restricted; you can see a lot 
more wearing scuba gear. But I'd seen the bottom before, and this was a new 
kind of experience. While diving is physical, this was mechanical ; I was 
inching my way along the ocean floor using a whole new set of skills. 
</P>
<P>
 When Council interrupted to announce that it was time to return topside, it 
felt like an intrusion. Reluctantly I obeyed his instructions to open the three 
valves that blew air into the submarine's tanks. Then, easing my concentration, 
I peered into the water as the little machine began slowly ascending like a 
bubble-bearing bottle. 
</P>
<P>
 Breaking the surface was a ego-gratifying experience. Suddenly light streamed 
in through the bubble above me as I heard the faint cheers of Council and his 
cohorts on deck. I felt a bit like Jacques Cousteau. It's not every day, after 
all, that a man can be an aquanaut. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone who goes down comes up with a smile," Council assured me.  
</P>
<P>
 I think mine is still on my face. 
</P>
<P>
 You can get yours by calling Avalon Aquatics at (800) 677-2822.

VIDEO REWIND; OLD WORLD AND NEW MEET ON 'HESTER STREET' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The culture shock faced by Jewish immigrants in New York's Lower East Side 
near the turn of the century is at the anxious heart of "Hester Street." 
</P>
<P>
 Directed by Joan Micklin Silver with a revealing eye for detail, the 1975 
movie stars Steven Keats as a tailor eager to leave his Old World Jewish 
traditions behind as he almost desperately strives for an Americanized 
make-over. His reinvention, which includes changing his Yiddish name Yekl to 
Jake, gets rough when Gitl (Carol Kane), his European wife, joins him but is 
less ready to scrap her traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Every marriage has its troubles, but those faced by Jake and Gitl would test 
even the most savvy counselor. Jake epitomizes selfishness and vulgarity on the 
path to a brand new lifestyle, and director Silver, who wrote the screenplay 
based on the story "Yekl" by Abraham Cahan, uses him as a symbol for all that 
was brash, hedonistic and egocentric in our culture at the birth of the 20th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not always a pretty picture, watching him fall for Mamie (Dorrie 
Kavanaugh), a flashy dancer, while he ignores the nice-girl Gitl; Silver isn't 
interested in turning him into a hero. Gitl's the victim-protagonist, and we're 
suppose to admire her (and we do) as she becomes more estranged from Jake while 
tenderly holding onto her Orthodox ways. 
</P>
<P>
 Silver could have used more irony to describe the heartbreak and hope at 
"Hester Street's" core, but she is still able to tell the story in an 
intriguing and relatively unsentimental style. The film also looks authentic in 
its re-creation of a hectic city and era, from the grimy Lower East Side 
streets to the period costumes. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, Kane is appealing in her complex role. It's not exceptional acting, 
but it is a better-than-average performance that relies on Kane's customary 
ability to trade on her innate vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hester Street" (1975), directed by Joan Micklin Silver. 92 minutes. Rated PG.

TICKET POLICY CHANGED

<TEXT>
<P>
 The directors of Adventure City, "The Little Theme Park Just for Kids" that 
opened last Saturday in Stanton, have announced a change in the park's 
admission policy. 
</P>
<P>
 According to co-founder Allan Ansdell Sr., many visitors on opening weekend 
expressed a preference for a pay-as-you-go policy as opposed to the 
single-ticket format originally implemented.So, as of this week, guests have 
two admission options, said Ansdell. 
</P>
<P>
 For $9.95, you can purchase one ticket good for unlimited access to the 
two-acre park's rides, attractions and entertainment. Or, you can pay $1.95 for 
admission to the park and live shows, then purchase separate tickets for each 
ride. A dozen tickets costs $5 and most rides require two to three tickets 
each, said Ansdell. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, when the park opened, children under 2 were admitted free. The new 
policy is that kids under 1 will be admitted free. For hours and other 
information, call (714) 236-9300. CORINNE FLOCKEN

KIDS ON FILM: CLEVER 'ANDRE' DOESN'T NEED TO FISH FOR COMPLIMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Lynn Smith is a staff writer for The Times' Life & Style 
section.

<TEXT>
<P>
 In "Andre," a charming motherless seal pup adopts a Rockport, Me., family, 
captivating the harbor master father and his lonely youngest daughter but 
sparking jealousy from his alienated teen-age daughter and bitterness among the 
town's fishermen, who blame seals for a bad season. (Rated PG.)  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About the only kids who didn't like "Andre" were pre-kindergartners frightened 
by dark and scary storm scenes, or teen-agers who live in a culture warp where 
it's unhip to admit to enjoying any movie that doesn't star Arnold 
Schwarzenegger. 
</P>
<P>
 All the rest were glued to the screen, fascinated by the dark, saucer-eyed sea 
mammal that appeared as graceful as a dancer and more intelligent, funny and 
heroic than most people. In the tradition of other animal movies, Andre offers 
an alien's love and devotion to the misunderstood, snarls at the enemy and 
shows an omniscient grasp of human problems and their solutions. But as a sea 
creature, he cannot live with them forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, to the children's obvious delight, Andre sponges up human behavior, 
watching TV, playing basketball, sharing a bubble bath. Before the movie was 
over, children were already imitating his most endearing trait -- a Bronx 
cheer. 
</P>
<P>
 Heather and Jennifer Hendricks, 6 and 3, respectively, were speechless 
afterward. But according to their grandfather, only minutes before, "They were 
just talking about Andre, Andre, Andre." 
</P>
<P>
 The movie, set in 1962, is based on the Goodridge family of Rockport and their 
famous seal, but was shot in Canada and used sea lions in the title role. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked it when he sticks his whiskers out and does stuff," said Peleiake 
Pestoni, 10. "It was funny, and it was based on a true story, and it was 
beautiful."  
</P>
<P>
 Peleiake particularly liked the cinematography depicting Andre's odyssey from 
the Aquarium in Boston, where he is eventually placed during the winter, to the 
Rockport Harbor, 200 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he comes home at the end, it's just water and mountains in the 
background," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her friend Melissa Rough, 10, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked the part where he kept coming home." 
</P>
<P>
 Several children were struck by the sad parts, notably when Andre breaks out 
of the barn where he is kept in a bathtub the first winter and disappears, 
leaving a trail of blood in the snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Haffner, 6, said he was saddened by a brief glimpse of a floating seal 
with bullet holes, the victim of an enraged fisherman. 
</P>
<P>
 One child had to be carried out of the theater crying, saying "I want to go 
home" in the midst of a storm scene when Toni, the young daughter, had gone out 
to sea in a small boat to search for Andre, who had been dumped by Toni's older 
sister and the sister's boyfriend, the son of an angry fisherman. 
</P>
<P>
 Needless to say, all ends well, with Andre playing a role. 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Haffner, 12, found the movie slow, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the movie was for little kids, I think."  
</P>
<P>
 But she said the subplot involving the surly older sister Paula and her 
boyfriend added something of interest for older kids.  
</P>
<P>
 The excruciating sensitivity of early adolescence comes across when Paula 
passes a note to Mark, her first crush: "Dear Mark, Do you like me? Yes or No. 
Circle one." Their first kiss ends in bumping foreheads. As her father becomes 
enmeshed in protecting Andre, he loses touch with his job and his family, and 
she complains he "likes that stupid Andre more than me." 
</P>
<P>
 The entire Haffner family of six wound up watching the movie when parents 
Nancy and Frank and and their 15-year-old son, John, couldn't get into "Clear 
and Present Danger." 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't like it that much," John said. "I like fast movies like 'Speed' and 
'Blown Away.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Frank disagreed, saying he was as captivated by the family subplots and the 
animal story as were the younger children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cried about two, three times," he said. "We're an animal family. We have a 
bird, a rabbit, a dog and a fish." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some other movies advertised as family films, this one lived up to the 
content and tone of the preview, Nancy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you saw was what you got."

SPECIAL SCREENING: NEGLECT FOR THE WORLD KILLS THE OASIS OF HAUNTING 'GARDEN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, Mark Chalon Smith is a free-lancer who regularly writes 
about film for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The cinematography for Vittorio De Sica's "The Garden of the Finzi-Continis" 
looks honey-dipped, with its golden colors and summery warmth. The mansion and 
lush grounds of the Finzi-Contini family are idyllic, the perfect world for all 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 What's going on outside the iron gates, however, isn't so nice. It's 1938, the 
place is Mussolini's Italy, and anti-Semitism is becoming the norm. The 
Finzi-Continis, an aristocratic, very wealthy Jewish family, ignore the truth 
for as long as they can in the life they've created in their garden. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie -- which won the Oscar for best foreign film in 1971 and screens 
tonight as the finale in the Bowers Museum's Italian film series -- is quietly 
absorbing because De Sica, never a flamboyant director at his peak, is so 
deliberate. 
</P>
<P>
 The creamy, pristine imagery (thanks to celebrated cameraman Ennio Guarnieri) 
makes a point -- when the cinematography becomes harsher at the film's end (and 
the garden is replaced by a grim detention center) -- we see reality fall like 
a heavy boot. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, though, it's mostly lovely, with the turbulence of fascism rising 
up, but only from a distance. The pretty facade of "The Garden of the 
Finzi-Continis" continues with De Sica's characters, mostly a group of Jewish 
college students with patrician features and graceful bodies. They're glamorous 
in their nonchalance. 
</P>
<P>
 Micol (Dominique Sanda), Giorgio (Lino Capolicchio), Alberto (Helmut Berger) 
and Malnate (Fabio Testi) are almost annoyingly attractive, but De Sica wants 
the symbolism to be clear. It can be too obvious, but the corrupting of their 
lives is still affecting as the movie goes nimbly down a tragic path. 
</P>
<P>
 The story is primarily told by Giorgio, a local boy whose love since childhood 
for the remote Micol, the only daughter in the Finzi-Contini clan, is rebuffed. 
Her passionate relationship with Malnate (who is not Jewish) and what happens 
to her ill brother, Alberto, are the key human events in "The Garden of the 
Finzi-Continis." 
</P>
<P>
 But it's really the loss of innocence as Hitler's "racial purity" perversions 
take hold that blanches everything. It changes the lives of all the students 
who visit the Finzi-Continis for tennis and talk, but the family seems 
strangely out of the loop. They feel they can continue their isolation, and 
that naivete makes their fall even more precipitous. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie is important as a sign post of De Sica's career. After a successful 
run as a silent matinee idol during the 1920s, De Sica turned serious and 
became one of the vanguards of the neo-realist movement in Italy. He made 
acknowledged classics such as "Shoeshine" and "The Bicycle Thief" during the 
'40s. 
</P>
<P>
 Audiences accepted these intentionally unsophisticated pictures as testaments 
to their own lives, left unsure after the war. But in the '50s they wanted to 
forget, and more entertaining movies sold tickets. De Sica responded by 
directing almost exclusively more commercial films, finding success in another 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 But with "The Garden of the Finzi-Continis," De Sica returned to his 
neo-realist inspirations. The movie is far more polished than his earlier, 
grittier work, but the inspirations are the same. He once again explores human 
character against a backdrop of social and personal confusion.

NEWSBITES: PASCAL WILL SERVE DELECTABLE PLATTERS, WINES FOR OYSTER LOVERS TO 
SAVOR 
</P>

<P>
 If the world is your oyster, be sure to check out the festival at Pascal on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Between noon and 4 p.m., a selection of five of the bivalves -- including 
examples from New Zealand, Chile and Prince Edward Island in Canada -- and 
breads from La Brea Bakery will be offered for $5 a plate. Four "perfectly 
oyster-matched" French wines such as Muscadet and Pouilly-Fuisse will be 
available at $3 a glass, or you can order Champagne for $5. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there anything to the mollusks' libido-raising reputation? "Of course, 
yes," restaurateur Pascal Olhats said with a laugh. "If not, I would never eat 
them." That and a strolling French accordionist should keep the romantic 
quotient high.  
</P>
<P>
 Remi Krug, a fifth-generation member of the French Krug family, releases 
vintage Champagne about twice a decade. He'll have four cuvees in tow on Monday 
-- the non-vintage Grande Cuvee and Krug Rose, Vintage 1985 and Clos du Mesnil 
1982 -- and they'll be paired with as many dishes, including a lobster and foie 
gras consomme with chervil, and braised turbot with osetra caviar and sorrel 
sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost is $105 per person, not including tax or gratuity. Hors d'oeuvres 
will be served at 6:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 1000 N. Bristol St., Newport Beach. (714) 752-0107. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lose that turbot with caviar, but still sample the Krug Champagnes and 
possibly save enough money to buy some, by attending a tasting and seminar with 
Remi Krug from 4 to 6 p.m. on Monday at Hi-Time Cellars. The seminar features 
identical wines and costs $25. (The 1982 Clos du Mesnil retails for $179.)

 250 Ogle St., Costa Mesa. (714) 650-8463.

</P>
<P>
 But back to Pascal Olhats, who's having quite the busy week:  
</P>
<P>
 Though Olhats hails from Normandy, tonight at the Mondavi Wine & Food Center 
he'll be teaching a cooking class focusing on family dining a la provencale. 
Two of the recipes from Provence are on Pascal's menu: sea bass with thyme 
crust, and free-range chicken with olives and sweet garlic. 
</P>
<P>
 Why not a class on dishes a la normande?  
</P>
<P>
 "Some people are born in the roses, some people are born in the cabbage," 
Olhats said. "I was born in the herb garden -- I'm crazy about herbs. And for 
herbs, Provence is the place." 
</P>
<P>
 The class runs from 6:30 to 9 p.m.; cost is $50. 
</P>
<P>
 1570 Scenic Ave., Costa Mesa. (714) 979-4510.

LOST IN O.C.: JUST A PAGE AWAY FROM GETTING PERSONAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, Jim Washburn is a free-lance writer who contributes regularly 
to The Times Orange County Edition. T. Jefferson Parker's column resumes in 
this spot next week. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Would you do me a favor for a moment and turn to page 37? I'll wait. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 It's just what I feared, isn't it? Here I am on this side of the page trying 
to carry on a serious journalistic career, and right behind my back are scores 
of personal ads by people intent on getting into each other's pants! How's a 
guy supposed to get any work done? 
</P>
<P>
 But wait, you say. Isn't it a mite presumptuous to be attributing libidinous 
intentions to all these people, who might actually be sensitive, caring, 
compassionate types -- not to mention the fact that they generate ad revenue? 
</P>
<P>
 I guess you're right. Why, just look at this actual ad found on the personals 
pages of the Recycler this past week: "Rock guitarist, sensitive, caring, 
compassionate, seeks beautiful, sexy supermodel type, 18-27." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe there should be a "Seeking Self" category for narcissists.  
</P>
<P>
 Here are a few of the modest descriptives people in our Dateline ads use to 
present themselves: stunning, alluring, gorgeous, classy, sexy, ebony beauty, 
Swedish Venus, 1 in a billion, Gentleman's Quarterly man, prosperous, Prince 
Charming, ruggedly handsome, awesome. And that's all from one ad!  
</P>
<P>
 Not really, but there is one guy who does seem to have all the bases covered, 
describing himself as a "Jeff Bridges, Bono, Sting, Peter Strauss look-alike." 
Did we leave out Flipper?  
</P>
<P>
 I loved the personals they used to run in Orange County Metropolitan magazine, 
which plumbed unprecedented depths of shallow. It seemed everyone in there 
likened themselves to a movie or TV star and was seeking someone who likened 
themselves to another movie or TV star: Liz seeks Dick; Richard 
Kimble-look-alike in search of one-armed-man-type; Ed Asner-type seeks 
romance/marriage with Mary Tyler Moore-ish babe. Never! Sacrilege! 
</P>
<P>
 There's a complex code to these ads, curious abbreviations to facilitate 
people trying to cram their heart, soul and buff stats into a 14-word ad. It 
was ages before I figured out that ISO stood for "In Search Of" instead of 
"ISOmetrics nut." Then there's all the no's: no smokers (n/s), no sexually 
transmitted diseases (no STDs) and so on. My favorite ad was one that appeared 
in the LA Weekly a couple of years back that concluded, "n/s, no STDs, no HIV, 
no CSN&Y." 
</P>
<P>
 I suspect there's another code in these ads as well: In these cautious times 
you have to read every word as if it's part of a game called "Guess My 
Neurosis." I haven't broken the code yet, but I suspect it's like the real 
estate ads, where every word masks another meaning -- you know, the way 
"charming cottage" really means "decrepit shed"?  
</P>
<P>
 What do these ISO people really mean when they say they love long walks on the 
beach? There are so many ads claiming that, that if they all really did love 
long walks on the beach there'd be so many of them down there they'd be bumping 
into each other in the dark. They wouldn't need to advertise. 
</P>
<P>
 It's got to be weird, meeting a stranger through a publicly placed ad. Even if 
it is a Kevin Costner-type, even a Sherri North-type, how can you feel secure 
letting your guard down? There are nuts out there. In light of the Bobbitt 
escapade, even a simple typo such as that found in one woman's Dateline ad last 
week takes on an ominous edge: "Bright, green eyes, really cute and cleaver. . 
." 
</P>
<P>
 At least meeting someone through The Times carries a bit of panache, more than 
with some other publications with personals listings: 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a great woman you've got there, Eric." 
</P>
<P>
 "Why thanks Phil, I found her in the Recycler." 
</P>
<P>
 Just doesn't sound good, does it? 
</P>
<P>
 I have recently rejoined the ranks of the in-search-ofs, but that's not why 
I'm checking out the personals. Rather, it just makes me feel a little bit less 
pathetic to know there's all these other lonely folks out there. I can't 
imagine ever calling on an ad because I prefer to believe love should happen 
through serendipity, chance, eye-contact and happenstance, and also because I 
don't need to cough up $1.39 a minute to get rejected by some stunning Venus. 
</P>
<P>
 So, how do I profess to be an expert on the motives of these people? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, as Waylon Jennings said he once told a prospective beau of his 
daughter's: "Son, I know what you're thinking, and I know what you're thinking 
with."  
</P>
<P>
 I can't presume to know what goes on in women's heads, but having been 
something of a guy for all my life, I think I've got our squirrely thought 
processes down. We want a love that's deeper than the world, one that will 
connect us with the universe, but we're willing to lower our standards a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 There may seem to be an inherent contradiction in the following sentence: 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, if you aren't the star-crossed soul-mate of my life, echoing in harmony 
for all eternity through the sad vastness of the universe, will you at least do 
the wild thing with me in my Plymouth Duster?" 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, to the guy brain, this makes perfect sense. Part of this may be because 
we confuse Plymouth Dusters with the universe, but mostly it is because we 
confuse women with God. Somehow we guys expect women to be 
that-which-we-are-not, to fill that huge longing we all feel and to make us 
complete, which is rather a lot to expect of someone. Fellini, by the way, made 
a very funny, sad and misunderstood movie on the subject called "City of 
Women." 
</P>
<P>
 Short of programming a VCR, sex may be about the most confusing thing we do. 
As far as I've noticed, it can be the most profound form of communication you 
can manage between two people. But at the same time it's inextricably tied to 
all that survival-of-the-species, monkey-drive stuff we have, not to mention a 
few thousand years of snickering repression.  
</P>
<P>
 And who is to say when it's shallow and when it's not? I've known couples for 
whom the marriage bed might as well have been a coffin, for how little love and 
understanding was exchanged there. 
</P>
<P>
 On the flip of that coin, someone who might have been me once had what ended 
up being a one-night stand a few years back that was practically life-saving, 
given the amount of compassion and caring shared between midnight and dawn. 
</P>
<P>
 With all the beer ads, soap operas, skin mags, cyber-sex CD-ROMs and 
super-model models we're all supposed to aspire to, it's a wonder any of us 
ever finds anything resembling true intimacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Do folks find it in the strange world transpiring on the other side of this 
page? I hope so, but I know it's not an avenue for me. 
</P>
<P>
 For the two years that I've been popping up in this column mere millimeters 
away from these ads, I have yet to see one that reads: "Seeking cranky Jim 
Washburn type."

3-HOUR TOUR: FROM ADOBE ABODE TO ICY CHALET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, Benjamin Epstein is a free-lance writer who contributes 
frequently to The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Want to beat the heat? Look no further than Costa Mesa. It's always cool 
inside the Diego Sepulveda Adobe, and kids and adults alike find its history 
even cooler. Then, for a way cool experience, spend some time on the ice at Ice 
Capades Chalet. 
</P>
<P>
 1 to 1:45: The Diego Sepulveda Adobe was built by the padres of San Juan 
Capistrano between 1823 and 1828. Estancia means "way station," and that's what 
the structure provided vaqueros herding mission cattle. Today, Estancia Park is 
landscaped with cactus and roses, palm and shady pepper trees, and is perfect 
for picnicking, or even a wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 Hank Panian guides about 600 third- and fourth-graders on tours of the 
restored and rebuilt adobe each year. He helped set the scene for its original 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mexico had just revolted from Spain," Panian said. "The Spanish empire was 
crumbling, replaced by 21 republics by 1823. But California was pretty 
isolated, and even after the revolution was over and done with, even in the 
midst of all that chaos, the padres still wanted to build a new building, and 
they did. Their mission wasn't over -- it wasn't military; it was spiritual.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our city's grab-hold, can-do, damn-the-torpedoes spirit is reflected in the 
construction of this building," noted the decidedly pro-Costa Mesa Panian. 
</P>
<P>
 Each room of the adobe represents a different period of Costa Mesa's history. 
The kitchen reflects the life of Native Americans, who had a village on the 
site before the adobe was built, and Colonial times. There's also an early 
20th-Century room.  
</P>
<P>
 "You know what the children are most fascinated (by) in this room? The chamber 
pots," Panian said. "Remember, no plumbing." 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent inhabitants were members of the Segerstrom family, who donated 
the adobe and its five-acre site to the city in 1963. Among the many owners 
were also Don Diego Sepulveda and Mexican War veteran and sea dog Gabe Allen. 
"Sepulveda owned it in the mid-1800s," Panian said.  
</P>
<P>
 1:45 to 2:30: Duck into Ball Park Pizza and digest all that history before 
hitting the ice. 
</P>
<P>
 The walls are decorated with sports paraphernalia and photo collages of 
customers and local Little Leaguers. "The whole Costa Mesa Little League comes 
here to eat," noted manager Rich Whitaker. There's a mural along the counter of 
Bart Simpson playing hockey in the house; another of Mickey Mouse, Goofy and 
friends playing baseball, and four big-screen TVs overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 A "Gilligan's Island" video game involves the Professor's secret formula for 
Lava Seltzer -- "eruptus interruptus" -- and Mary Ann's hot pineapple pies; the 
flashing image of Jim Backus means the game is over. The umpire in the Baseball 
Card game says, "Steee-rike one!" but if you win, you get football cards. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandwiches with names such as Bench Warmer and Slam Dunk are $3.50. Pizzas 
range from $2.70 for a plain cheese mini to $16.85 for a large Grand Slam, and 
the ingredients always taste crisp and fresh. Try a pizza with onions, 
anchovies and jalapenos; garlic powder (but no fresh garlic) is available on 
request.

 2:30 to 4: No matter how hot it is outside, bring along warm clothes, and 
maybe even gloves, to the Ice Capades Chalet, where it's 45 degrees year-round. 
Some skaters bundle up like Eskimos on a night run, while others sport T-shirts 
and shorts; hockey wanna-bes wear their Wayne Gretzky best, while Nancy 
Kerrigan wanna-bes are all turned out in skimpy tutu-like skirts. The shop 
sells mittens and socks in case you forgot yours; those things that look like 
somebody buzz-sawed Robocop's forearms are called hockey gloves. 
</P>
<P>
 Once on the ice, the first thing you'll notice is a burning sensation in your 
lower legs. Don't know how to stop? That's what those walls are for! If you're 
a beginner, don't skate with your hands in your pockets no matter how cold you 
get, or there go the brakes. Though many skaters blithely skate backward with 
more speed and grace than most of us could ever manage forward, it's a comfort 
to know you're also sharing the rink with a lot of other misguided missiles. 
</P>
<P>
 Skaters' parents are invited for free coffee at Bilbo Baggins, just across 
from the rink's viewing windows. Inside the rink, vending machines offer 
chicken noodle soup and chili with beans. Hot drinks include whipped chocolate 
and spiced cider, but the T-shirt crowd will no doubt opt for ice cream bars. 
Rest up with a round of "Blades of Steel" video hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 The chalet also offers real-life hockey programs ranging from Termite teams 
for ages 3 to 5 on up to leagues for adults 30 and over, and a variety of 
skating and fitness classes. General admission is $5.50, skate rental $2.50. 
Skates are free on Mondays, and Wednesdays are Family Nights -- $19 for four 
skaters and rentals. 3-HOUR TOUR

STEEL-FRAME CODE CHANGE TO BE SOUGHT; SAFETY: CITY COUNCIL WILL BE ASKED TO 
ENACT STOPGAP BAN ON CONSTRUCTION OF THE TYPE FOUND VULNERABLE IN QUAKES. MORE 
STRINGENT STANDARDS ARE GOAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 City building officials recommended Tuesday that the Los Angeles City Council 
enact a temporary ordinance to alter the way steel-frame buildings are 
constructed. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance would change part of the building code section governing 
requirements for beam-to-column connections in steel-frame buildings -- the 
major source of problems in such buildings damaged during the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been found that the connection doesn't perform adequately, and we don't 
want any additional buildings to be built with this connection," said Richard 
Holguin of the city's building department. 
</P>
<P>
 The request for an emergency design standard, expected to go before the full 
council next week, was made Tuesday during a special meeting of the Ad Hoc 
Committee on Earthquake Recovery and was prompted by post-quake inspections 
that found serious problems in the welded connections of steel-frame buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 110 steel-frame commercial buildings -- most of them in the San 
Fernando Valley and on the Westside -- were damaged during the quake. Another 
900 such buildings could suffer structural damage if there is another major 
quake here, according to the Los Angeles Department of Building and Safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knows at this point that (the current code section) doesn't perform 
to the expectations of the engineering community," Holguin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically in steel-frame buildings, horizontal beams and vertical columns are 
welded together. In some buildings, these connections broke or cracked during 
the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 The subsection of the code that would be suspended by the temporary ordinance 
currently allows builders of steel-frame structures to build without conducting 
involved studies and tests to prove that their connections are sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Holguin described the code section as "sort of a cookbook approach to the 
design of that connection. . . . It told you specifically, 'If you do this and 
this, you don't have to go into an elaborate test procedure to show that the 
design will work.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The temporary ordinance would require builders to meet more detailed design 
requirements and perform a more in-depth study of the connections, Holguin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will have to prove to the department that the connection will work, 
based on design, based on tests or both," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailer Martin, a private structural engineer, showed photographs to the 
committee of welded joints that cracked during the quake. Some cracks were 
three-eighths of an inch long. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 30 steel-frame buildings Martin has inspected in West Los Angeles and 
in the Valley, he said 21 "have serious problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The temporary ordinance would only apply to new buildings that have not been 
issued permits, not to existing buildings or those being repaired, Holguin 
said. It would remain in effect for a maximum of a year but would be followed 
by a proposal for permanent changes, Holguin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The final answer will depend on some of the testing taking place," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, tests on steel-frame buildings are being conducted at UC Berkeley 
and at the University of Texas at Austin.

 Hairy situation: Beverly Hills takes pride in its glitz, but its landmark 
barbershop embraces old age enthusiastically. "We still have our 1950 barber 
chairs," said William Gornik, the owner of Gornik-Drucker's. And its employees 
are called barbers , not hairdressers or haircutters or stylists, and none of 
them go by one name. 
</P>
<P>
 Former President Ronald Reagan and various Hollywood celebrities are still 
customers, but one of the 57-year-old shop's oddest claims to fame is it once 
was Barbershop to the Mobsters. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Drucker, the 88-year-old founder, is fond of telling the story of 
sometime rivals Bugsy Siegel and Mickey Cohen "coming into the shop at the same 
time," says manager Melody Pepaj. "And people were afraid they were going to 
pull out their guns and start shooting. Mr. Drucker asked Cohen not to come in 
any more." 
</P>
<P>
 Siegel was a problem enough, especially with his receding hairline. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a pathological fear of losing his hair," writes Dean Jennings in "We 
Only Kill Each Other." "And at Drucker's . . . the diplomatic barbers ritually 
assured him they could see new growths here and there." 
</P>
<P>
 Drucker's was, in fact, one of the last places Siegel visited on June 20, 
1947. Later, freshly coiffed, he returned to his girlfriend's house, where he 
was shot to death by rival gangsters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next day," Pepaj said, "Mickey Cohen called up and made a reservation." 
</P>
<P>
 But go easy on the pepper: Dick Adler noticed that a company describing itself 
in an ad as a "worldwide leader in (the) herbal food industry" is searching for 
a "seasoned writer." 
</P>
<P>
 While you're chewing on that one, we might add that the company is based on 
Abalone Avenue. 
</P>

 Question of the Week: It's a query on a billboard near the L.A. Convention 
Center. We're speechless, but would be interested in faxed or mailed reactions 
from readers. We still have many truly tacky gifts in our Cave of Wonders to 
give away.

 To Oxnard and back: After we mentioned that guidelines for L.A. City employees 
peg the cost of a round-trip flight from L.A. to Oxnard at $442, we heard from 
David Weissmann of United Express. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two airlines, United Express and American Eagle, fly a total of 14 flights a 
day in and out of LAX to Oxnard," Weissmann said. "In the two years I have been 
in Oxnard I have never seen air fares as high as $400. In fact there is a fare 
available for $59 each way (about the same or less than most door-to-door 
shuttle services)." Are you listening City Hall? (Probably not.)

 We admire their stubbornness: Louis O'Brien and Joseph Feinstein each notified 
us about a for-sale ad for two grave sites at Hillside Memorial Park. The 
anonymous couple who placed it described themselves as "two lovely people, who 
since, they can't take it w/them, ain't going." miscelLAny: 
</P>
<P>
 To our list of celebrities who have sites named after them, Judy Brooks points 
out we forgot about Ol' Middle-Aged Blue Eyes. Yup, Desert Hospital of Palm 
Springs has a Frank Sinatra Jr. Room.

SCOTT HARRIS: ANTI-ABORTION MAIL SHOWS IT CAN HAPPEN HERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In lieu of flowers, Planned Parenthood of Los Angeles had a suggestion for 
people who wanted to express their feelings about the recent deaths of Dr. John 
Bayard Britton and his 75-year-old bodyguard in Pensacola, Fla. You may recall 
that Dr. Britton and James Barrett, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel, 
were shotgunned at close range, allegedly by an anti-abortion zealot who had 
claimed such actions constitute justifiable homicide. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days after the killings, Planned Parenthood sent a fund-raising letter 
to 150,000 households. This may seem a bit exploitative. Then again, it seems 
safe to assume that Dr. Britton and Mr. Barrett would have appreciated the 
gesture. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dear Pro-Choice Friend," it began. "Tragedy has struck again. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Some recipients, it seems, didn't appreciate the appeal. One was returned with 
this scrawled on the bottom: 
</P>
<P>
 How did you baby killing bastards get my name?  
</P>
<P>
 Take me off your mailing list at once!  
</P>
<P>
 May you all burn in hell!  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Planned Parenthood shared some of their more colorful correspondence with me, 
I suspect, because they couldn't fulfill my original request. Ever since the 
point-blank shotgun slayings of Dr. Britton, 69, and Barrett, I'd been hoping 
to meet a doctor who would tell me what it is like living in fear of 
God-fearing, gunslinging wackos out there. You don't have to travel to 
Pensacola to have a brush with the jihad. When they told me how one of their 
physicians was followed home and subjected to a protest outside her front door, 
I figured she'd be a fine interview. But it was no go. Even with assurances of 
anonymity, Planned Parenthood officials tell me, doctors who perform abortions 
are extremely wary of public attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've seen one of their own shot in the head in the last month, so how can 
you blame them?" said Suellen B. Wood, executive director of the agency's Los 
Angeles operations. "It strikes close to home." 
</P>
<P>
 So they showed me the mail instead, further impressing the point that, yes, it 
could happen here. Less than a year ago, a Bakersfield clinic that performs 
abortions was torched -- one of 87 acts of arson since 1977 chronicled in a 
recent report by the National Abortion Federation. That report, issued before 
the slayings of Britton and Barrett, noted the March, 1993, murder of Dr. David 
Gunn, also in Pensacola, and the August, 1993, nonfatal shooting of Dr. George 
Tiller in Wichita, Kan., as well as 37 bombings, 91 assaults and 178 death 
threats. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of a doctor, Planned Parenthood suggest I talk with the director of a 
San Fernando Valley clinic, who had previously allowed her name to be used in 
the press. This director, it turned out, had changed her policy. She requested 
anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Shock, she said, was the immediate reaction to the slaying of Dr. Britton. 
After the shooting of Dr. Gunn, she explained, she could comfort herself with 
the belief that it was the act of a single lunatic. These slayings erased the 
comfort zone. 
</P>
<P>
 But it would be wrong to suggest that fear pervades the clinics. Security 
precautions are "part of the daily routine." Workers survey the parking lot for 
suspicious characters. They try to enter and leave the building in pairs. They 
remove name tags and surgical gear to mask their identity. "After awhile, 
you're not thinking about the reasons you're doing this," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The occasional homicide is a good reminder. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund-raising effort, Wood says, has been going well. But the most profound 
impact of the recent shootings is how it has further splintered abortion rights 
opponents. Officials in Operation Rescue, the anti-abortion group known for its 
militant tactics, have acknowledged that violence perpetrated in the name of 
stopping "baby killers" has alienated many former supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood said she appreciated the fact that several people responded to misfired 
fund-raising letters with thoughtful letters explaining why they abhor abortion 
and abhor the violence of extremists. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood says that Planned Parenthood intends to write back, hopeful that she can 
find some "common ground" with those who argue that the best means of birth 
control isn't abortion, but rather education and the promotion of abstinence. 
Wood says she intends to point out that Planned Parenthood spends 95% of its 
budget on education and other matters, trying to make abortion a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
 "We very much appreciate," she said, "those folks who are thoughtful about 
what they do."

 It was planned long ago and seemed a wonderful idea at the time. My husband 
decided that our family, four generations, should all get together and do 
something that all could enjoy -- from great-granddaddy down to the youngest 
child. 
</P>
<P>
 And what is it that would appeal to all these different age groups? A major 
league baseball game, of course! So he purchased 15 tickets. Sure, it was 
expensive. But it was so pro-family, so American, so much fun to look forward 
to. Oh yes, the date of the game was to be Aug. 13. Of course, we never made it 
to the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh well, my husband will get his money back, and goodness knows we can use it 
elsewhere. But it's a sad day when the fat wallets of the overpaid players and 
arrogance of the owners can stomp on the sensibilities of the fans who provided 
their wealth.

 * First, you must understand. I love the Dodgers. I just plain love baseball. 
My friends call me Mr. Dodger. But I have made a personal vow. If and when the 
season resumes, as it undoubtedly will, I will not attend one more game this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger Stadium is one of my favorite places to be in the world. But enough is 
enough. Fans are the ones who are fueling the fires of monetary insanity. Nine 
out of 10 people believe players make too much, already. But yet we continue to 
support this madness by overspending on every facet of the game. From 
overpriced tickets, beer and hot dogs to parking and peanuts. Most of 
baseball's revenue comes from us.  
</P>
<P>
 When the game returns, don't show up. Don't reinforce the belief of the owners 
and players that this money pit is bottomless.  
</P>
<P>
 We should strike! After all, we are the ones with the clout. But the sad thing 
is, come the first day back, you won't be able to find a ticket, even if you 
wanted one.

CUBA CRISIS: ITS ROOTS TRAVEL MANY TROUBLED DECADES; CLINTON CONFRONTS A 
SITUATION EXACERBATED BY WASHINGTON'S EARLIER POLICIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Washington's difficulties with Cuba go back a long way, well before even Fidel 
Castro's 1959 revolution. Some reach back as far as the Spanish-American War; 
others lie in the 1950s, the days of the corrupt dictator Fulgencio Batista, 
when perhaps the most noteworthy American investments in Cuba involved criminal 
enterprises. But the current troubles, with waves of Cuban refugees setting 
sail for the United States as Castro's decrepit regime slowly crumbles, have 
been more exacerbated than assuaged by key U.S. foreign policy decisions these 
last few years. 
</P>
<P>
 CASTRO'S FAILED REVOLUTION: A hothouse of poverty and exploitation, Cuba was 
ripe for revolution when Castro's committed band of communist revolutionaries 
methodically chopped their way down from the mountains and seized power in 
Havana. Too bad Castro did not have the right prescription for what ailed Cuba. 
For over the years -- despite some success in health care services and 
education -- his communist regime proved every bit as rancid and perhaps even 
as corrupt as its venal capitalistic predecessor. Today Cuba stands on the 
precipice of unrelieved poverty -- and perhaps, once the 68-year-old Castro 
himself is gone, of civil war too. 
</P>
<P>
 No revisionist apologies for Castro, please. He had his chance and he blew it. 
He got oodles of rubles from his patrons in Moscow, but the money went almost 
nowhere but down some systemic black hole. Cubans had their independence from 
the Yanquis -- and it's understandable that they should want it and only right 
that they should have it. But they paid a stupefying price for it -- bondage to 
an economic system that doesn't appear to work anywhere, and an alliance to a 
Soviet empire that is no longer around when they most need it. 
</P>
<P>
 THE BEST AMERICAN POLICY: In Washington there is little crowing now over 
Cuba's predicament, nor should there be. From the bankrupt decision under 
Dwight D. Eisenhower to support Batista unreservedly through the misconceived 
Bay of Pigs fiasco under John F. Kennedy, U.S. policy toward Cuba has been a 
bipartisan study in lack of understanding and creativity. Not to exculpate the 
Clinton Administration from all responsibility for the current situation, of 
course, but the President did in fact inherit one great mess. 
</P>
<P>
 The question now is how to make the best of it. Our suggestion, for starters, 
is that the Administration avoid dramatic lurches of any nature -- whether 
feral notions of invasion or fist-around-the-windpipe blockade; the same for 
fuzzy thoughts about cozying up to the maximum leader to try to somehow 
democratize his discredited regime. Instead, what's needed is a careful policy 
that looks to America's long-range interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Those interests certainly include, as a starting point, a stable nation only 
90 miles from Key West, Fla. We should neither seek to impose our own 
government on Cuba, even if that were possible, nor to hasten Castro's downfall 
with ham-handed intervention; resultant civil war and societal breakdown might 
leave us with an even worse refugee calamity. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudent and persistent U.S. policy -- along the lines now laid down by the 
Administration -- would continue to discourage illegal refugee migration, and 
resumption of the unofficial but regular dialogue with Castro that past 
Presidents including Gerald R. Ford and Jimmy Carter have had would be helpful. 
That dialogue, among other things, needs to accommodate the legitimate 
interests of the Cuban American community in south Florida. Those interests 
include the transfer, now disrupted, of private cash and other materiel from 
Miami to relatives and friends still in Castro's island prison. This 
assistance, while not substantial enough to keep Castro afloat, does ease the 
suffering of many Cuban families. It also reduces the desperate drive to 
emigrate. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans have the tendency, when confronted with a crisis, to believe that 
for every problem there is a solution. But long-festering problems are rarely 
solved quickly. It would be a mistake akin to those Eisenhower and Kennedy made 
to presume that 35 years of problems with Havana can be solved overnight. What 
is called for now, above all, is patience. Closing the Door U.S. Coast Guard 
has been intercepting Cubans tryingto flee to Florida.

 Mickey Conroy, a state Assembly member from Orange County, has been accused of 
sexual harassment. While the merits of a lawsuit brought by a former aide will 
have to be decided in court, the legislator and his chief of staff already have 
been reprimanded, properly, by an Assembly committee for a procedural 
violation. 
</P>
<P>
 The harassment suit was brought by a woman who says the lawmaker kissed her 
several times, made repeated sexual comments and finally fired her after she 
complained. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy has denied the allegations and without elaborating says that the 
assertions of his accuser, Robyn Boyd, arose from "unfortunate 
misunderstandings." 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly member, a Republican from Orange who represents one of the most 
solidly Republican districts in California, says his office has taken 
"immediate corrective action where appropriate."  
</P>
<P>
 Pending the legal outcome, there has been a finding in this case in the area 
of Assembly policies and procedures. What happened, according to the Assembly 
Rules Committee, was that Conroy and his chief of staff, Pete Conaty, violated 
Assembly policy by not reporting Boyd's sexual harassment charges to the state 
Equal Employment Opportunity counselor assigned to the Legislature. Conroy 
should have insisted on that, and he and Conaty have been disciplined privately 
as a result of a Rules Committee inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time of long-overdue sensitivity to sexual harassment issues, a spate of 
such allegations in the Capitol lately suggests that the problem will not just 
go away. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conroy case stands as reminder of the need for governmental officials at 
all levels to insist that proper reporting guidelines be followed in their 
offices whenever accusations are made, and for them to be held accountable for 
doing so.

HOME HIV TESTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I strongly disagree with your support of a home HIV test (editorial, Aug. 7). 
A home HIV test is not analogous to a home pregnancy test. It is analogous to a 
home cancer test. I can't imagine any responsible care provider telling people 
they have a potentially terminal disease by mail or over the phone. I can't 
imagine relying on a printed package insert of an 800 number to ensure that an 
HIV-positive person is immediately linked with the treatment and services he or 
she desperately needs. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Los Angeles Free Clinic, we provide individual counseling before each 
test. Our counselors are trained to identify people who may be suicidal or have 
other mental health needs. After a test, we are able to respond to people 
immediately and individually. We can assess needs on the spot, and make 
referrals for treatment and counseling.  
</P>
<P>
 Our counselors also play a tremendously important role in educating people 
about staying safe, and offering suggestions and support for safer behavior. We 
have peer counselors who can speak directly to adolescents -- a group at 
increasing risk for HIV -- in a way that a printed brochure or an 800 operator 
simply cannot. 
</P>
<P>
 When someone tests positive for HIV, they need to know there is help, and 
there is hope. A home HIV test just reinforces the shame and isolation that 
accompany HIV. 
</P>

<P>
 * I believe that we cannot stand in the way of a new technology that has the 
potential to extend and save lives. At our clinics and hospices, we see 
firsthand the human toll that delayed treatment for HIV is taking. Among the 
2,000 clients at AIDS Healthcare Foundation's clinics, 1,200 (60%) are below 
200 T-cells and have already experienced severe immune compromise.  
</P>
<P>
 Half of all people with HIV in Los Angeles are tested for the first time when 
they are hospitalized or as a result of HIV symptoms. In Los Angeles, as across 
the country, fewer than 50% of the people who are HIV positive know it. In Los 
Angeles County, Centers for Disease Control-sponsored testing programs are the 
least successful of any in the country. With a 1.3% rate of detection, our 
testing program has the lowest rate of sero-positivity and we do the fewest 
tests. Often, many people do not return to get their results.  
</P>
<P>
 The testing program is not working. The people who are most in need of testing 
are not being tested. Testing sites are clogged with lower-risk individuals. I 
support HIV home-collection testing because I believe it provides an 
alternative that will encourage more people to be tested. 
</P>
<P>
 I share the concern of other community activists about the psychological 
distress that a positive test brings. However, I believe the direct access 
counseling program guarantees a very high quality of telephone counseling and 
referral services. This experience is one far superior to most counseling and 
referral services that are currently being provided to HIV-positive persons.

 It's sad to read your article "Change Is Slow in Therapy Group for Men Who 
Batter" (Aug. 11). 
</P>
<P>
 It states that half of those men ordered into counseling drop out and only 
about half of those who finish the course stop beating their partners. Based on 
this 75% failure rate, it is even more of an urgent reason for society to bring 
this issue early into our education system, targeting today's teen-agers, boys 
and girls, about equality and mutual respect.

UNZ ON BROWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am responding to Ron Unz's satire of my economic strategy and plan to 
revitalize California's economy (Column Right, July 28). Satire comes to mind 
since Unz's misinterpretation of my proposals borders on the comical. 
</P>
<P>
 California is in the throes of its worst economic downturn since the Great 
Depression. After four years of Pete Wilson's fiscal and economic 
mismanagement, it's time for new leadership and new ideas to turn California 
around. Given his vigorous attacks during the Republican primary on Wilson's 
failed economic record, Unz knows full well that California families cannot 
afford four more years of Wilson's neglect. 
</P>
<P>
 I have put revitalizing California's economy at the very top of my agenda. 
After four years of record job losses and business failures, it's time for new 
economic leadership and an innovative partnership between the private and 
public sectors. 
</P>
<P>
 My plan starts with getting government out of the way of business, slashing 
red tape and cutting wasteful spending, and using the savings achieved to keep 
taxes down. It also includes tax incentives for job-creating businesses, 
expanded access to new capital for firms of all sizes, a modern, world-class 
work force development program and "California First" preferences in the 
awarding of state contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a plan that has been praised and endorsed by business leaders, leading 
economists and other business experts.

MEXICAN OFFICIAL ON PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Mexican Official Denounces Ballot Measure" (Aug. 15) should send a cold chill 
throughout California that is unwelcome, even in this summer's heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Foreign Minister Andres Rozental's bombastic remarks about Proposition 
187 (the Save Our State initiative) missed their mark, and instead scored a 
direct hit on Mexican-American relations. Often at cross purposes in the past, 
the United States and Mexico seemed to take a different turning with NAFTA. 
Apparently, that turning is leading to a dead end. 
</P>
<P>
 How can we join in partnership with another government that does not respect 
the sovereignty of our own? There is nothing more fundamentally American than 
the ability to elect our own government. When any other country attempts to 
direct or to control the outcome of an American election, it threatens the 
essence of our nation. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, we can decide for ourselves how to solve our own problems. All 
of us working together will find the best solution. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * As a Californian, I am outraged that the ambassador is allowed to threaten 
us with "potentially negative effects" in commerce, if we will not provide, 
free of charge, housing, education and medical care for his citizens. The 
Mexican government fails to provide these services to its citizens, but I am 
expected to provide them to any Mexican citizen who can sneak across the 
border. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a terrible thing to deny a child an education, or a sick person medical 
care. However, the criticism must be aimed at the Mexican government; it is its 
responsibility to do these things.  
</P>
<P>
 Californians care for their people and educate their children. It is a 
terrible shame that the people of Mexico do not do the same. But, Mr. 
Ambassador, stop asking me to do for your citizens what you will not do for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 RONALD HAYES 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * I was appalled by the outrageous statements made by Harold Ezell, co-author 
of Proposition 187 in "Immigrant Measure Foes Open Drive" (Aug. 19). I was most 
appalled, however, by his suggestion to let the Mexican American Legal Defense 
and Educational Fund open a clinic to provide immunizations for the children of 
California! 
</P>
<P>
 Not only does the statement reveal the incredibly racist motivation of the 
authors of the proposition, it also epitomizes the mentality that asks why 
taxpayers should support services which do not directly benefit them. The 
answer is one that civilized societies throughout history have given -- no man 
or woman is an island. The shortsighted xenophobes who authored Proposition 187 
seem to have forgotten that the health and education of each person in our 
society affect us all, in both the long and the short term. 
</P>
<P>
 I only hope and pray that we, the people of California, will not allow our 
legitimate concerns about illegal immigration to be transformed into a yes vote 
for this mean-spirited proposition that will harm us all.

COLUMN RIGHT/ ROBERT K. DORNAN: A NEW STARR LEAVES THEM TREMBLING; COUNSEL 
NAMED TO WHITEWATER PROBE IS TRULY INDEPENDENT, A QUALITY THE DEMOCRATS FEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT K. DORNAN, Robert K. Dornan is a Republican congressman from Orange 
County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since a special three-judge panel rejected the Clinton Administration's 
request to appoint Robert Fiske as independent counsel and instead named 
Kenneth Starr, congressional Democrats have been crying foul, charging that 
Starr, solicitor general in the Bush Administration, is not truly 
"independent." 
</P>
<P>
 It is ironic that many of the strongest supporters of independent counsels in 
the past now contend that the process used to appoint eight of them during 
Republican administrations has failed and that Starr should step down. 
According to these first-time critics, Starr's appointment smacks of partisan 
skulduggery. Nothing could be further from the truth. 
</P>
<P>
 The independent counsel process is necessary, according to its proponents, to 
prevent the inherent conflicts of interest that exist when a president's 
Justice Department must investigate or prosecute one of its own in the 
executive branch. The special three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals, 
which is charged with appointing independent counsels, therefore acted properly 
when it rejected Fiske as independent counsel on Whitewater.  
</P>
<P>
 Fiske was appointed special counsel by Atty. Gen. Janet Reno at a time when 
she did not have the authority to request an independent counsel. As a special 
counsel, Fiske was an official of -- not independent of -- the Justice 
Department. So the elevation of Fiske to independent counsel would have caused, 
at the very least, the appearance of a conflict of interest.  
</P>
<P>
 In a July 13 letter to Judge David Sentelle of the special panel, I, along 
with nine Republican colleagues, expressed the view that Fiske should be 
disqualified because a major part of the Whitewater investigation "concerns the 
Justice Department's role in thwarting prosecution of the Whitewater-related 
Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan collapse." We also cited other possible 
conflict-of-interest concerns, including Fiske's "numerous contacts with key 
officials in the Clinton Administration prior to his appointment as special 
counsel -- including a long-running relationship with Bernard Nussbaum," 
Clinton's former White House legal counsel. In addition, Fiske formerly 
represented the International Paper Co., which "sold land valued at roughly 
$550,000 to the Whitewater Development Company" and "received loans totaling 
over $7 million from the Arkansas Development Finance Authority, which was 
created by the Clinton Administration." 
</P>
<P>
 While we were careful not to recommend the appointment of a specific 
individual -- only that it not be Fiske -- congressional Democrats and the 
Administration went to considerable lengths to obtain Fiske's appointment. 
During House and Senate negotiations on reauthorization of the Independent 
Counsel Act, a provision was added that waived the prohibition against 
appointing as independent counsel anyone who is serving in a public capacity, a 
provision clearly inserted to permit the appointment of Fiske and to confer 
Congress' blessing upon him. 
</P>
<P>
 After the reauthorization, Reno requested a Whitewater independent counsel. 
Having been given clearance from Congress, she took the unusual step of 
specifically requesting Fiske's appointment.  
</P>
<P>
 The judicial panel rebuffed Reno, stating that the appointment "would not be 
consistent with the purposes of the act. . . . As Fiske was appointed by the 
incumbent Administration, the court therefore deems it in the best interest of 
the appearance of independence contemplated by the act that a person not 
affiliated with the incumbent Administration be appointed." 
</P>
<P>
 This was a shock to those who have a political interest in sweeping Whitewater 
under the rug and who had developed tremendous "respect" for Fiske, especially 
after he repeatedly insisted that Senate and House hearings be limited in 
scope. This offered congressional Democrats political cover for avoiding a 
thorough vetting of Whitewater.  
</P>
<P>
 Today, all the President's men face an uncertain future. Their inability to 
control events by securing the appointment of Fiske has left them trembling 
with fear. But it is a fear unleashed not by a Republican conspiracy, but by an 
independent counsel "monster" that the Democrats themselves created. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent counsels are supposed to be independent of executive branch 
pressure and coercion. They are not supposed to be independent of individual 
values or thought, which are Starr's qualities that Democrats dislike most. 
While we must wait to see what kind of independent counsel Starr will be, it is 
already certain that the rejection of Fiske will help to ensure that the 
American people have confidence that the Whitewater investigation will be fair 
and thorough.

COLUMN LEFT/ ALEXANDER COCKBURN: BIG LABOR GIVES WORKERS EMPTY WORDS; GLOBAL 
CAPITALISM RULES ALL; UNIONS MUST ACT GLOBALLY AS WELL, OR LABOR DAY IS A JOKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEXANDER COCKBURN, Alexander Cockburn writes for the Nation and other 
publications. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the last $20-an-hour jobs are gone, when the eight-hour day for which so 
many fought for so long is but a distant memory, when strikes are legally 
banned, the Wagner Act tossed in the trash can and America a land of $6-an-hour 
part-time jobs with no benefits or security, what will they do with Labor Day 
or May Day, which used to be celebrations of the might of organized labor and 
the hopes of working people? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, they'll linger on no doubt, as holidays whose original source and meaning 
have long since been forgotten, or part of dimly remembered folklore. Maybe 
some older knight of labor with a sense of history will evoke memories of a 
more glorious and combative past, when unions were a mighty power in the land. 
</P>
<P>
 What would such a knight of labor tell the working folk? We have the text. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were never meant to be beggars at the table of wealth. We were never meant 
to be the apostles of labor cannibalism on the world stage. We were meant for a 
higher destiny. We were never meant to be the lieutenants of capitalism. We 
were never meant to be the pallbearers of the workers of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The man who uttered these powerful revolutionary sentiments is a mainstream 
Big Labor chieftain: Jack Henning, executive secretary-treasurer of the 
California Labor Federation, addressing the biennial convention of the state 
AFL-CIO in Sacramento last month.  
</P>
<P>
 Henning began by citing the "never-ending conflict between labor and 
employers," which continues into the present era of global capitalism, in which 
"American capital spits on the American flag" when doing so suits its purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the human disposition to resist tyranny," Henning said. "In the 
cesspools of 19th-Century capitalism, there came a response, modern unionism. 
There was another reply. In 1848, Karl Marx issued the Communist Manifesto, 
which called on the workers of the world. He said, 'Unite, you have nothing to 
lose but your chains.' The resulting movement, however flawed, had a vision of 
global unionism." 
</P>
<P>
 Henning narrated the collapse of Soviet communism and the failure of 
non-communist labor unions to build a militant global response to international 
capital. In each country, labor sought only national self-interest. "An 
example: When AT&T transferred all of its phone-set manufacturing to Singapore 
for the low wages, for the long hours, the Singaporean labor movement embraced 
that. In response to an AFL-CIO protest, they said what labor nationalism 
always says: 'We take care of ours, you take care of yours.' We were meant for 
something more than that!"  
</P>
<P>
 Global capitalism, Henning said, rules America today, and the titans of the 
corporate system -- General Motors, General Electric, the big banks -- bestride 
the world. Their power in Washington shapes trade policy. To labor, Washington 
offers nothing: The North American Free Trade Agreement was proof of that. "The 
two-party system can't give relief because capitalism . . . finances both."  
</P>
<P>
 Henning concluded that the AFL-CIO should issue a convention call to all the 
unions of the now-prevailing free world. "At that convention, there could be 
chartered treaties and accords of defense to ban and abolish the cannibalism 
that becomes necessary when capital controls the respective societies of the 
nations of the world. Global unionism is the answer to global capitalism. There 
is no other way." 
</P>
<P>
 A fine speech. It could serve well as the standard text for flights of oratory 
in future Labor Days. But it does raise the question posed by all such bursts 
of tremendous rhetoric: What connection do these words have with reality? Alas, 
not much. 
</P>
<P>
 Henning, now in his late 70s, has long been delivering intermittent bursts of 
fiery sentiments. But between speeches, life goes on as usual. The state 
AFL-CIO endorses Democrats, many of whom duly sell out labor. In the executive 
suites of the state labor federation, ideas of how to mobilize workers in 
California gather dust. 
</P>
<P>
 The AFL-CIO whose international reputation Henning lauded is loathed by union 
organizers in the Third World as the sponsor, along with the Central 
Intelligence Agency, of such outfits as the American Institute for Free Labor 
Development, whose role is to destroy just the sort of radical unionism Henning 
calls for. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with political rhetoric in America is that no one believes it. 
Beautiful words pour from the speaker's mouth, while reality takes another bite 
out of the seat of his trousers. 
</P>
<P>
 So come on, Jack! Denounce the AFL-CIO national leadership. Get with Tony 
Mazzocchi of the Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers and form that working 
people's party you've both been calling for. Don't just talk, do something 
real.

'DO AS I SAY' DOESN'T CUT IT WITH TEENS; FAMILY VALUES: ADULT BEHAVIOR AND 
COMMERCIAL CULTURE MUST CHANGE FIRST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA DAFOE WHITEHEAD, Barbara Dafoe Whitehead is vice president of the 
Institute for American Values in New York City. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As part of his plan for welfare reform, President Clinton seeks to bring down 
the rate of unwed-teen parenthood, a major generator of child poverty and 
welfare dependency. He plans to replicate successful programs that encourage 
teen-agers to postpone sex -- and to use the bully pulpit of the presidency to 
deliver a stern message to teens: Don't have sex until you are older. Don't 
have babies before you are married. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a challenging task. Clinton deserves credit for attempting it. But to 
succeed, he must bring his campaign to adults as well. The norms governing 
teen-age sexuality are not set solely by the teen-agers. Adult conduct and the 
commercial culture strongly shape adolescent attitudes and behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 The rise in unwed-teen parenthood is part of a much broader shift in patterns 
of sex and marriage. No change is more pervasive or dramatic than the increase 
in illegitimate births among women of all ages. Unwed motherhood has risen by 
82% since 1980. Nearly one out of three births occurs outside of marriage. Most 
unwed mothers are over 20. The biggest rate of increase in unwed childbearing 
has come among women who probably have the greatest control over their 
fertility: college-educated women. And the trend toward runaway fatherhood was 
under way long before this generation of teen-agers reached puberty. One of the 
classic responsibilities of adults is to set an example for children. An 
example has been set. 
</P>
<P>
 Though some persist in portraying unwed motherhood as social rebellion, the 
facts tell a different story. More than half of adult Americans -- including a 
whopping 70% of younger adults -- say that a woman should be able to bear a 
child outside of marriage without reproach. Illegitimacy is now as American as 
the Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
 Closer to home, parents' sex lives affect the sex lives of their children. 
Research suggests that children who are persistently exposed to the sex lives 
of their dating parents are more likely to be sexually active at an early age. 
Girls who grow up in single-mother families have sex earlier than girls who 
live with both parents. Since young teens are the least likely of all age 
groups to engage in protected sex, early sexual initiation increases the risks 
of early pregnancy and childbearing.  
</P>
<P>
 More alarmingly, girls who grow up in single-mother households with a string 
of drop-in or live-in boyfriends are at a higher risk for sexual abuse and 
coercive sexual initiation than are girls who grow up in intact families. Such 
traumatic sexualization, harmful in itself, is also associated with later 
sexual risk-taking. Moreover, lack of parental supervision and protection is a 
key factor in exposing daughters to the risks of early sex and pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 And grown-ups, not kids, run the advertising, entertainment and alcohol 
industries that rely so heavily on sex to sell products to the lucrative youth 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, teen-age sexuality does not exist in a vacuum. It is part of a 
larger social ecology that must change if we expect teen-agers to do the right 
thing. 
</P>
<P>
 This raises some questions for the President as well as for a society 
increasingly eager to get rid of the welfare system: Can we offer tough talk to 
kids without a few cautionary words to the adults? Can we ask teen-agers to zip 
up and hold back without asking for some voluntary restraint from those who 
sell tapes and tickets and T-shirts to them? Can we ask poor minority 
teen-agers to marry before they become parents without upholding the same norm 
for more privileged white adults?

NORTHRIDGE ADVANCES TO U.S. FINAL; LITTLE LEAGUE: THE CALIFORNIA TEAM DOES ALL 
IT NEEDS TO, AND MORE, IN 2-0 VICTORY OVER VIRGINIA SQUAD. THE TWO TEAMS PLAY 
AGAIN TODAY.

 Justin Gentile struck out 13 in a one-hitter Wednesday night to give 
Northridge a 2-0 victory over Springfield, Va., and set up a rematch in today's 
Little League World Series semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Venezeula and Saudi Arabia will meet in the international bracket. Saudi 
Arabia stunned Taiwan 3-2, keeping the Far East champions out of the finals for 
just the second time in 19 World Series appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Little League tie-breaker, Northridge could advance only if it won 
or kept Springfield from scoring five or more runs in Wednesday night's 
round-robin finale. Gentile gave up only a leadoff single and two walks. 
</P>
<P>
 Springfield already had locked up a berth in the semifinals. Thursday's 
winners play Saturday for the Little League World Series title. The United 
States has won the last two championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge scored its first run in the third when Gregory Wallis reached on a 
fielder's choice, moved up on Gentile's single and scored on Nathaniel Dunlap's 
single to left off Patrick Malatino (0-1). 
</P>
<P>
 The Californians loaded the bases in the sixth on singles by Mathew Fisher and 
Matthew Cassel and Peter Tuber's walk. Michael Frost's sacrifice fly scored 
Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
 Gentile (1-0) struck out the first two batters in the sixth and after Patrick 
Malatino reached on an error, Mike Fratoe flied out to left. 
</P>
<P>
 By picking up a run in the sixth, Northridge could have lengthened the game, 
requiring the Southern champions to pick up more runs to win. If Northridge had 
not scored in the sixth, Springfield would have needed a single run and a grand 
slam to knock Northridge out of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Daryl Bradford briefly kept hopes alive for Middleboro, Mass., by hitting a 
grand slam in an 11-5 victory over Brooklyn Center, Minn. Brooklyn Center was 
knocked out with the loss, and Northridge's victory later knocked out 
Middleboro. 
</P>
<P>
 In Saudi Arabia's victory, Ronald Baptiste struck out 10 and hit a two-run 
homer. Also Wednesday, Venezuela beat Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, 3-0 in a game 
that had no bearing on the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradford's grand slam, off reliever Eric Tauscheck in the third inning, gave 
Middleboro a 5-2 lead. Brooklyn Center starter Dwayne Erickson (0-1) walked 
Jake Kutzy, Christian Perry and Kevin Brower and gave up a single to Brandon 
Soule to open the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Middleboro had been winless until Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the grand slam, there was a total change of attitude on the bench," 
Middleboro manger Steve McKenna said. "Today we had a very good hitting attack. 
I think the kids were kind of waiting to break out." 
</P>
<P>
 Middleboro added six runs in the fifth after Brooklyn Center first baseman 
Steve Kruger was ejected for tossing his bat after a called third strike ended 
a two-out threat with runners at first and second. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like the strike zone was changing several times during the game," 
Brooklyn Center coach Dan Erklouts said. "He (Kruger) is an intense competitor 
and I think he was feeling like he had to make something happen. When you take 
the leadership away, it team kind of flattens." 
</P>
<P>
 Brooklyn Center committed three errors in the top of the fifth, when 
Middleboro sent 10 batters to the plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooklyn Center had taken a 2-0 lead in the first after walks to Krissy 
Wendell and Jason Erklouts and a single by Jermar Larkins loaded the bases. 
Sean Aasen had a two-run single. Brooklyn put on a brief rally after falling 
nine runs behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Baptiste's two-run home run in the third gave Saudi Arabia a 3-1 lead, but on 
the mound Baptiste (2-0) had to work himself out of jams when Taiwan put 
runners in scoring position in the last five innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Taiwan's Yu Chih-Feng opened the home first with a solo homer and the Saudis 
tied the game on John Schoenholtz' home run in the top of the second. 
</P>
<P>
 Baptiste gave up a two-out homer, to Wu Hsiu-Fan, in the fifth. In the sixth, 
Piao Chun-I singled but was doubled off first when Huang Kuo-Chang popped up a 
bunt to diving third baseman Chistopher Norseth. Baptiste struck out Shih 
Hsiang-Kai after giving up a single and walk to Chih-feng and Weng Mao-Ting. 
Hsiu-Fan (1-1) was tagged with the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Esteban Avila, Erik Villalobos and Guillermo Quiroz had RBIs for Venezuela on 
Wednesday. Elio Perez (1-0) gave up only two hits. Adam Shibinette (0-2) took 
the loss.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NATION; WHEATLEY SUFFERS SHOULDER 
INJURY, TO MISS OPENER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michigan's Tyrone Wheatley, the All-America running back who some say defied 
logic by choosing a senior season over the NFL draft, almost certainly will sit 
out the Wolverines' season opener -- and possibly two more games -- after X- 
rays Wednesday revealed a second-degree separation of his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheatley suffered the injury during a Tuesday practice. His shoulder was 
placed in a protective sling, where it will remain until a second set of X-rays 
are taken next week to determine if the injury is healing properly. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring any unexpected complications, Michigan team physicians are hopeful 
Wheatley would sit out no more than the team's Sept. 4 game against Boston 
College at Ann Arbor. At the very worst, said Michigan spokesman Bruce Madej, 
Wheatley also would sit out the Sept. 10 game at Notre Dame and possibly a 
Sept. 24 home game against Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would guess he would miss (games), but to what extent I don't know," 
Wolverine Coach Gary Moeller said. "I would doubt he'll play against Boston 
College." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the second injury to Wheatley's right shoulder in the last 14 months. 
While covering a punt against Illinois last October, Wheatley was hurt and 
couldn't play in a loss to Wisconsin and a victory over Purdue. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a different kind of injury than the one that he sustained last year," 
Moeller said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Wheatley misses only the first game, Michigan's chances to remain a 
national championship contender, as well as the favorite in the Big Ten 
Conference, aren't affected. But a longer absence could be damaging, not only 
to the Wolverines' postseason plans, but also to Wheatley, who returned for his 
senior year in hopes of improving his place in the NFL draft -- from a sure 
top-10 pick in 1994, to the No. 1 selection overall in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big blow because he has lots of experience," Moeller said. "But, as 
I've said before, this team does not ride solely on Tyrone Wheatley. Obviously, 
we're a better football team with him than without him, but Ed Davis and Tim 
Biakabatuka just have to pick up the slack." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis and Biakabatuka combined for 691 yards and seven touchdowns last season. 
Wheatley, Michigan's career record holder in rushing touchdowns (35) and yards 
per rush (6.35), ran for 1,129 yards and 13 touchdowns in 1993. GENE

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; USC; WALTERS HAVING SWEET DREAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 USC tailback Shawn Walters takes his daily nap on the floor of Heritage Hall, 
where he sleeps on a red carpet between two Heisman Trophies. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Walters, who figures to start for the Trojans in their season-opener 
against Washington, dream of winning the Heisman? 
</P>
<P>
 "Every running back here dreams of that," Walters said. "But I'm just 
basically thinking about what's going on for the next practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Walters, who rushed for a team-high 711 yards and scored seven touchdowns last 
season, said he reported for practice in the best shape of his career. Walters, 
who played at 225 pounds last season, lost seven pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did a lot of running over the summer," he said. "I ran a lot of hills and I 
ran on the beach. The year before last I didn't really do anything during the 
summer, but this year I worked out a lot harder during the summer." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback Leonard Green, who had missed several days of practice with a 
hamstring injury, reinjured his right hamstring Wednesday and was driven off 
the field on a golf cart. . . . Guard Richard Beatie and linebacker Isreal 
Ifeanyi got into a minor scuffle during practice. However, they were quickly 
pulled apart and no punches were thrown. "It's getting late into camp and 
people get tired and tempers flare," Beatie said. . . . USC, which has 
practiced twice a day since the start of camp, will practice only once today 
because players have to move out of the dorm where they've been housed. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The atmosphere at practice seems more relaxed under Coach John Robinson than 
under Larry Smith. Fans, who were banned from the field during Smith's six-year 
regime, are allowed to watch practice from both sides of the field. . . . The 
Trojans are sharing their practice fields with the women's soccer team, which 
played and practiced at Cal Tech last year. When the football team practices at 
Dedeaux Field, the women's soccer team uses Howard Jones Field. The teams swap 
fields in the afternoon. CHRIS BAKER

FINANCIAL MARKETS; WEAK FACTORY ORDERS SEND DOW SOARING 70.90; MARKETS: THE DOW 
JONES INDUSTRIAL AVERAGE SOARS, BUOYED BY HOPES THAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL 
NOT RAISE INTEREST RATES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The stock market soared Wednesday after an unexpectedly weak reading on 
factory orders fueled hopes that the Federal Reserve Board will not raise 
interest rates soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average reached a five-month high, advancing 70.90 
points, or 1.88%, to 3,846.73. That was the highest level since March 23, when 
the closely watched index closed at 3,869.46. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also the biggest one-day gain since April 5, when the Dow rose 82.06 
points, or 2.2%, to 3,675.41. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike Tuesday's broad rally, which boosted the Dow 24 points, Wednesday's 
market gains were concentrated in blue-chip companies. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 5 to 3 
on the Big Board, where volume totaled 310.52 million shares, up from 307.44 
million Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks began their advance at the opening bell, in concert with bonds and the 
dollar, after the Commerce Department reported that orders to U.S. factories 
for big-ticket items declined a surprising 4.2% in July, the biggest drop in 2 
1/2 years. Economists had been forecasting a moderate gain of around 0.3%. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts insisted that the falloff, which was far larger than expected, 
was a statistical aberration and not a sign that the recovery being enjoyed by 
American manufacturers was about to be derailed. 
</P>
<P>
 They noted that more than half the drop occured because auto plants shut down 
production for two weeks in July for their annual retooling for the new model 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 But other analysts said the weakness went far beyond autos, with declines 
widespread in virtually every sector. They said it was strong evidence that the 
Fed's rate increases, intended to dampen inflationary pressures, were beginning 
to have an effect in slowing the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow rose sharply near the end of the session, prompting the New York Stock 
Exchange to impose restrictions on program trading at 3:32 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad market indexes, however, under-performed the rest of the market. The 
NYSE's composite index rose 2.17 to 258.61. The Nasdaq index of mostly smaller 
companies rose 3.74 to 751.72. The Standard & Poor's 500 list rose 4.52% to 
469.03. 
</P>
<P>
 Government bond yields plunged, and investors, emboldened by news of 
unexpectedly weak factory orders, snapped up this week's final batch of new 
Treasury notes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond fell to 7.45% from 7.54% on Wednesday. 
Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, rose 31/32 point, or $9.69 
per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the dollar firmed against the German mark and the Japanese yen, 
with traders in that market citing the gains in the bond and stock markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar closed in New York at 100 yen, up from 97.90 on Tuesday. The dollar 
also fetched 1.545 marks in late New York dealings, up from 1.532 marks. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Components of the Dow average rose sharply. International Paper rose 3 1/2 
to 74 7/8, amid optimism about rises in paper prices. Alcoa added 2 1/8 to 79 
1/2, Minnesota Mining & Manufacturing rose 1 3/8 to 56 3/8, Bethlehem Steel 
rose 7/8 to 21 1/4, General Motors advanced 2 1/4 to 50 7/8, and Exxon climbed 
7/8 to 59 7/8. IBM fell 1/4 to 67 3/8 after it said it was cutting prices on 
some of its personal computers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Amgen fell 2 3/4 to 53 1/4 after Lehman Bros. and Goldman Sachs downgraded 
the stock. 
</P>
<P>
 * Blockbuster Entertainment dropped 1 3/8 to 26 1/2 on news late Tuesday that 
its board reaffirmed approval of a proposed merger with Viacom Inc. Viacom 
ended down 1 1/2 to 38 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * American Barrick Resources slipped 3/8 to 21 5/8 after it signed an 
agreement with Lac Minerals Ltd. under which Lac will recommend a sweetened 
Barrick takeover bid to its shareholders. Lac rose 1/4 to 10 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mining stocks were boosted by a rally in the price of gold. Newmont Mining 
rose 1 to 41 1/4 and Placer Dome gained 7/8 to 21 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Morgan Stanley fell 1 5/8 to 67 1/2. Oppenheimer & Co. downgraded its rating 
on the Wall Street firm's shares to "under-performer" from "market performer." 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, stocks were higher, with Mexico's Bolsa soaring up 42.69 points to 
close at 2,798.22. 
</P>
<P>
 London's Financial Times 100-share average ended above 3,200 for the first 
time since March. The index closed up 30.1 points at 3,205.2. Frankfurt's 
30-share DAX average ended up 18.50 at 2,126.37, and Tokyo's 225-Nikkei average 
closed at 20,511.60, up 130.82 points.

 Advanced Micro Devices to Build Plant in Germany: The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based 
company plans a $1.3-billion facility that will employ about 1,400 people in 
the eastern German city of Dresden, authorities said. Germany's federal 
economics minister, Guenter Rexrodt, made the announcement in a news release, 
though the Dresden-based Saxony state government said the decision was awaiting 
approval of the company's board Sept. 14. An Advanced Micro Devices Inc. 
spokesman would say only that the company was engaged in preliminary 
discussions with Saxony officials. The spokesman would not give details; he 
said the company was "exploring a whole range of options" for its next plant, 
which will be devoted to microprocessor production.

WESTSIDE WATCH: AIR CONDITIONING MAN CHILLS OUT WITH COLD CASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mother Nature has not smiled on Jim Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
 A self-employed air conditioning contractor from Santa Monica, Marshall does 
not appreciate one of the Westside's chief assets -- its cool ocean breeze. 
That, combined with his mechanically challenged truck, has put a decided damper 
on business, the 45-year-old bachelor says. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Mother Nature failed Marshall, Lady Luck has not. Last week he won 
$25,000 in the California Lottery's Big Spin, after purchasing a Scratcher 
ticket from the Fernwood Market in Topanga. 
</P>
<P>
 Heartened by his good fortune, Marshall has decided to take life by the 
lapels. First, he says, he will buy a reliable truck. Then, he adds, he will 
move to a place where air conditioning contractors are truly appreciated -- the 
desert.

 "I'm a lucky camper," said Florance. "I'm clean (of cancer). I caught it soon 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Florance underwent a routine physical earlier this summer, before he and his 
wife set out on a monthlong vacation. When they returned, Florance's doctor 
called back with the final test results, and recommended that he undergo 
surgery as soon as possible to remove three polyps from his colon. One was 
malignant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel pretty good," Florance said. "I won the right race."

<P>
 PRIMARY DEJA VU: Florance, meanwhile, says that he has no plans to endorse 
either Brooks or incumbent Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills) in the November 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 "The primary's over," he said. "I don't want my name bandied around that I am 
endorsing anyone when I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
 Florance asked Brooks to stop saying just that in a letter he wrote to her 
campaign just before his surgery. According to friends of Florance, Brooks told 
a Croatian American Assn. gathering that she and Florance "have been friends in 
the past, still are friends and Ron Florance is now supporting Susan Brooks for 
Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 "I had never met you, or established any type of relationship" before the 
primary campaign, Florance said in his letter. "During the primary, I think it 
is fair to say no friendship was created." 
</P>
<P>
 But Brooks denies saying that she had his endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
 "My only public comment is that you have been a good Republican and that I 
would like your support," she said in a letter she sent to him last week. She 
added that he could view a videotape of the event to see for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates have communicated only by mail since their bitter primary 
race. During the primary race, Brooks questioned Florance's business background 
-- in what Florance called a smear campaign.

KEY HEARING NEARS ON BLUFF PROTECTION PLAN; ENVIRONMENT: PANEL'S APPROVAL WOULD 
SEND LAND-USE PROPOSAL TO THE COUNCIL. ACTIVISTS GIVE IT LUKEWARM SUPPORT, 
WHILE SOME HOMEOWNERS SAY IT IS TOO RESTRICTIVE. 
</P>

<P>
 For more than seven years, city planners, environmentalists and residents have 
wrangled over a plan to protect the Westchester-Playa del Rey bluffs, habitat 
for such sensitive species as the burrowing owl and site of one of the last 
strips of coastal sage on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the plan, which is intended to regulate development and land use along the 
cliffs that act as a buffer between residential areas and the sensitive Ballona 
Wetlands, faces a key hearing before a City Council subcommittee on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 If the subcommittee adopts the plan, which has drawn lukewarm praise from 
environmentalists and complaints from residents that it is too restrictive, it 
would go to the City Council -- the final step for approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, which will be the subject of a community meeting Monday at 6 
p.m. at the Westchester Municipal Building, was drafted in 1988 by the city 
after residents and city planners became alarmed by the spread of palatial 
homes atop a three-mile bluff area that runs from Westchester to Playa del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics alleged that some single-family mansions topped 8,000 square feet and 
sold for at least $1 million, clashing with the smaller residential tracts in 
the community and posing potential environmental problems for the Ballona 
Wetlands below because of water runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, the Coastal Bluffs Specific Plan was proposed. It was designed to 
ensure public access to the coast, control bluff erosion, preserve ocean and 
Los Angeles skyline views and reduce the effects of grading by regulating land 
use and development in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The 13-page proposal outlines restrictions on residential and commercial 
construction such as use, height, density, size of front and side yards and 
drainage to "assure that development is compatible and in character with the 
existing community." The limitations vary depending on the slope and steepness 
of the lots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our plan will save the bluff face from undue erosion and protect the 
wetlands, but will still give homeowners the ability to build large houses or 
add to the already existing structures," said Nancy Burke, a planning aide in 
Councilwoman Ruth Galanter's office.  
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, no more than 40% of a lot can be covered by a structure unless 
a lot is less than 5,000 square feet, in which case 45% can be used. 
</P>
<P>
 The limits have angered many homeowners, who have struggled to understand the 
complex plan's arcane guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playa del Rey has already been built and these restrictions make no sense," 
said Tom Ennis, a Playa del Rey resident, echoing the concern of many 
homeowners. "What if you own a home that covers 60% of your lot? Your home will 
be devalued because you can't do anything with it -- you won't be able to 
remodel." 
</P>
<P>
 Not so, Burke said. The plan, she said, has been modified to allow additional 
construction on existing homes that already cover more than 40% of the lot. 
Owners may build up to existing height limits and increase square footage, but 
may not increase the structure's perimeter. In short: build up, not out. 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents complain that the building limit too closely approximates the 
city's hillside ordinance, which was adopted two years ago to stop large 
hillside homes from overwhelming narrow streets and choking off firetrucks' 
access to homes. Some believe the wide streets in the Westchester-Playa del Rey 
bluff area are a mitigating factor that should not warrant such restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forty percent may be fine for a mansion in Bel-Air with a huge lot, but it 
doesn't help if you have a small house on a tiny lot near the beach in Playa 
del Rey," said Jim Hinzdel, a Playa del Rey resident. "This ordinance pushes 
around the value of housing: a few gain, most lose." Burke stood by the 
limitations. 
</P>
<P>
 Another source of irritation has been the plan's exemption of the eastern edge 
of the bluffs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1980s, UCLA was allowed to buy a 57-acre site on the eastern 
bluffs and it built 86 faculty homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola Marymount University is also building an athletic field with 
underground parking and a business school atop the bluffs. Construction of two 
dormitories and four apartment buildings for 1,250 students will begin in July, 
1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big institutions such as Loyola and UCLA have been able to do their grading, 
excavation and elevation work without some of the restrictions that we have," 
Ennis said. "We have homeowners west of Lincoln (Boulevard) that have 
restrictions on their property who can't even see the ocean." 
</P>
<P>
 The exemption was made because the area was outside the coastal zone needing 
protection from development as outlined by the Coastal Commission. The 
universities' buildings complied with city zoning, said Don Taylor, a city 
planner. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, many environmentalists are heartened that the bluff proposal may 
finally be coming to fruition. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bluffs are a natural corridor for animal movement and hawk flight which 
can be interrupted by houses on the edge of the bluff," said Howard Towner, a 
professor of biology at Loyola Marymount University and a board member of 
Friends of Ballona Wetlands, an environmental group. "The area is also a 
habitat for sensitive species such as the burrowing owl and has the last strip 
of coastal sage in the region. I'd like to see an outright prohibition of any 
development on the bluff face. But this plan is better than nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 Others wish action would have been taken earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame that Howard Hughes couldn't have donated some of this land to 
the public. Once it's in private ownership it's very hard to prohibit 
building," said Danna Cope, a member of the Westchester-Playa del Rey Community 
Advisory Planning Committee, made up of residents and organized by Galanter. "I 
realize many people are concerned about the resale value of their homes but 
there's only one bluff."

BRIEFLY; EDUCATION: STUDENT IS ARKANSAS-BOUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A West Los Angeles high school student has received a full academic 
scholarship to attend the University of Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 The university awarded Mark Landsberg, 18, a Chancellor's Scholarship, a 
four-year, merit-based $9,548 scholarship that covers tuition, fees, housing 
and a stipend for books and materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Landsberg will begin classes at the university's Fulbright School of the Arts 
and Sciences at the end of the month.  
</P>
<P>
 He was named a National Merit Finalist and scored in the top percentile of the 
Scholastic Achievement Test. He has not decided on a major. 
</P>
<P>
 The University High School graduate said he is ready for a change. "Eighteen 
years is enough (to live in Los Angeles). I thought I'd try something new, and 
I've never seen real snow; only Knott's Berry Farm's snow machine."

FAMILY; GRIEVING SPOUSES, CHILDREN FIND EMPATHY 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perched on a red beanbag chair, 6-year-old Benji Schwartz told the children 
sitting in a circle of an instance when he longed for his father, who had died 
from a brain aneurysm a year before. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I feel sad because I don't have a father, and there's no one to 
carry me to my mom's bed while I'm sleeping," Benji said quietly. "But when I 
go to the cemetery and visit him I feel happier . . . because I feel like I'm 
visiting him at home." 
</P>
<P>
 The four other children in the group at Our House bereavement center in West 
Los Angeles, nodded, each one familiar with the feelings triggered by having to 
visit a parent in a cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the hall, Benji's mom, Candie Schwartz, sat with a group of young 
widows, speaking of the emotional impact her husband's death had on her, Benji 
and her 8-year-old daughter, Jaimie. 
</P>
<P>
 Benji had withdrawn and started hiding under furniture, she said. So a teacher 
referred the family to Our House, a nonprofit, non-sectarian agency that 
provides grief support groups for young families and children who have lost a 
parent. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz said Jaimie and Benji came out of their first peer support group 
thrilled to have met other children who had lost a parent and could understand 
their feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 Since they started attending the support groups, Schwartz said with a smile, 
"we don't hide under tables any more." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Primarily sustained by donations, Our House is believed to be the only 
Westside organization that offers bereavement support to children as young as 
age 3 who have lost a parent. 
</P>
<P>
 Our House founder Jo-Ann Lautman, a former member of the Cedars-Sinai Medical 
Center Hospice Team, organized a similar bereavement program at the Stephen S. 
Wise Temple in Los Angeles in 1986. Seven years later, through grants and 
donations, she opened Our House, which has served 150 people since then. Almost 
a dozen peer groups for children and adults are held twice a month. 
</P>
<P>
 In a low-rise office building on Sepulveda Boulevard, the center is a bright 
oasis of color, its rooms decorated to create a homey atmosphere. The adult 
groups meet in the largest room, nicknamed the living room, while the children 
meet in "the den" -- filled with beanbag chairs, toys and art supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Peer support groups work well for children, said Hilary Cohen, a social worker 
and executive director of Our House. Children of similar ages can share their 
feelings about the death of a parent and can give and receive support from one 
another, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One child can tell the other kids how they dealt with a similar loss. For 
example, they can tell each other how they handled their birthday without one 
of their parents. One of the group facilitators can talk about it, but we're 
still adults. Their peers are more powerful," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Art, play and music projects are used in the children's groups to bring up and 
clarify the youngsters' feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 One project from a recent session was a long piece of paper on which group 
facilitator Lori Cohen had drawn a large genie. Cohen, who is not related to 
Hilary Cohen, said she had asked each child in the group to write down three 
wishes that a magic genie could grant. A 6-year-old girl wrote in blue crayon: 
"1) I wish that my mom could come back to life; 2) I wish my brother was not a 
pest; 3) I wish no one in my family would ever die again." 
</P>
<P>
 Although what the children say can be heart-rending, it is important that they 
talk about their emotions, Hilary Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not depressing because it's such a relief for these kids to come here 
and talk -- about their parents or about anything," she said. "Parents will say 
about their kids, 'Oh, they won't talk; they're very shy.' But the kids come 
here and we can't get them quiet," Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Holidays, birthdays, and anniversaries can be especially hard. 
</P>
<P>
 September is a hard time of the year, 7-year-old Marissa Schaeffer told her 
group, because it is the month of her parents' wedding anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to help (my dad)," said Marissa, explaining that she tries to keep the 
wedding pictures away from her father because looking at them makes him cry. 
"And that makes me cry, and I don't like to cry." Marissa and her 5-year-old 
sister, Michelle, lost their mother almost three years ago to an aneurysm. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going into seventh grade, and my graduation (from elementary school) was 
really sad," said Sol Rapoport, 11, whose father died of cancer two years ago. 
"I graduated with honors, including honors in math. And I practically wouldn't 
have graduated if my dad hadn't helped me with math. He was an engineer." 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad was always proud of me, and now I found my dad isn't there to be proud 
of me," Sol said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the kids are meeting across the hall, the adults meet in groups 
specifically designed for young widows and widowers to discuss the wide range 
of feelings that arise from suddenly being a single parent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It started as a safe place to cry," said Debbie Miller, a 42-year-old 
personnel manager, describing Our House. Miller, who lost her husband, Neil, to 
cancer, attends the young widow and widowers group every other week while her 
9-year-old daughter, Julie, goes to a children's group at Our House. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a home here," Lautman said. "We're not an institution. For these people, 
home was a place that once brought comfort and security -- and then that was 
shattered. They can use Our House to rebuild themselves until their own homes 
are secure again."

BRIEFLY; BUSES: MTA RAISES ONE-WAY FARES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority will begin a new bus fare structure 
on Sept. 1 that will abolish the regular $42 monthly pass and raise fees from 
$1.10 to $1.35 for one-way fares. 
</P>
<P>
 The monthly pass, according to MTA spokesman Greg Davy, was not offering 
passengers an equitable fare."The people who most needed it could not afford 
it," Davy said. The increase in the fare was made to help balance the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA hopes the elimination of the monthly pass will lead to increased use 
of bus tokens, which cost 90 cents for a one-way fare, a 33% markdown off the 
regular cash fare. The tokens are sold in bags of 10 for $9. The gold and 
silver colored coins will be sold at 460 locations throughout Los Angeles 
County. 
</P>

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; JOB DREAMS FLY HIGH AT AVIATION CAMP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON GARCIA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 16-year-old Ayinde Mitchell, the dream of flying started when he was a 
toddler. "I've always had an infatuation with how planes fly," said Mitchell, 
an honor student at Westchester High. 
</P>
<P>
 As he got older, Mitchell's dreams became more ambitious and his goals turned 
toward business and government. 
</P>
<P>
 But he never lost interest in aviation, and after spending a week at the 
Aviation Careers Education camp flying Boeing 727 simulators, learning the 
history of African Americans in aviation and landing a single-engine Cessna at 
Santa Monica Airport, Mitchell made a career decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be a CEO, a politician and I like aviation -- so I came up with 
airport manager," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
 That is what the organizers and backers of the ACE camp, which is based at the 
Museum of Flying at Santa Monica Airport, like to hear. 
</P>
<P>
 The weeklong program run by the Federal Aviation Administration is aimed at 
encouraging minority students to find jobs in aviation, from airline pilots and 
mechanics to airport managers and astronauts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There just isn't the youth excitement about planes today," said James 
Whitehead, an FAA safety manager and retired Air Force general who helped start 
the ACE program in Los Angeles. Flying today is taken for granted, he said, and 
the ACE program is designed to change that. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the program has more than 80 camps across the nation, this is the 
first year an ACE camp has been located in the Los Angeles Basin, said FAA 
spokesman Hank Verbais. The 31 students who participated this year were chosen 
by local community groups, including Young Black Scholars and the Inglewood 
Police Department.  
</P>
<P>
 The camp was started in 1971 by a former military pilot turned judge who was 
tired of sending teen-agers to prison. It has evolved into a hands-on training 
session that takes students out of the classroom and puts them in the cockpit, 
Verbais said. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA requires regional directors to strive for at least a 50% minority and 
female enrollment in the camps. In its first year here, the minority enrollment 
was more than 95%, almost exclusively African American, Whitehead said. 
</P>
<P>
 During camp, students spend some of their time attending lectures on the 
history of aviation and the basics of flying, plus group discussions with 
industry professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 But students spend the majority of the week touring passenger and cargo 
terminals at Los Angeles International Airport, the control tower at Santa 
Monica Airport and several types of aircraft -- including a customized, luxury 
727 owned by MGM Grand and an MD-11 wide-body hollowed out to ship packages for 
Federal Express. Students also operated Boeing 727 and 737 simulators through 
takeoffs and landings. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, flying a single-engine Cessna -- with an instructor -- was the 
highlight of the camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought I would be able to fly," Westchester student Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials estimate that the camp can cost as much as $50,000 to operate -- far 
more than the $1,000 provided by the FAA. Some ACE camps charge up to $100 to 
participate, Verbais said. 
</P>
<P>
 But donations by local companies and organizations have made up the difference 
and allowed the camp to run without charging students tuition in Los Angeles, 
said Fred Richards, an FAA employee who directs the class.  
</P>
<P>
 So far, camp officials are optimistic about running the camp next year, but 
Whitehead keeps a realistic attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are tough times and it's all based on funding," but there is widespread 
private interest in supporting the program, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea is to turn kids on to flying, and you can't do that in a 
classroom," he said.

<P>
 A 26-year-old Venice filmmaker has begun work on a docudrama about a tagger 
turned artist, part of a project to alert high school students to the dangers 
of gang and youth violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Bennett Gonzalez's film "Choices," based on actual events, is the story 
of two tagger friends.The central character becomes an artist as his friend 
becomes more involved in gangs and violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a positive story," said Gonzalez. "He uses his creativity to 
transcend the neighborhood. I have tried to shed light on why some kids make it 
through and others don't." 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica Police Department has donated space and equipment for 
Gonzalez's five-member film crew. Officer Joe Analco, a community relations 
officer with the department, plans to use the film as part of his "Officer Joe" 
school outreach program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt this would be another positive outreach for the kids," said Officer 
Analco. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the script is complete, filming has not begun. Gonzalez is relying on 
material donations, such as tapes and film, financial contributions and 
volunteers for the project, which he expects to cost $50,000. LORENZA MUNOZ

 Los Angeles City Councilman Marvin Braude has proposed measures to alleviate

 On Tuesday, Braude urged the City Council to authorize police to set up 
barricades on Rockingham to regulate the flow of pedestrians and vehicles for 
at least 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Braude also proposed a measure that would limit parking on Rockingham to 
residents with city-issued stickers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, what we're proposing is the formation of a preferential parking 
district for area residents," said Glenn Barr, a spokesman from Braude's 
office. "Anyone without a parking permit would be cited." 
</P>
<P>
 Barr said Braude asked that the processing be expedited so that the measure 
will pass "within weeks instead of years." 
</P>
<P>
 "Cities are already allowed to authorize police departments to close streets 
because of crime, traffic and safety, and, in fact, these factors exist at O. 
J. Simpson's house," Barr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the normally quiet affluent district have been complaining about 
the traffic congestion since the bodies of Simpson's former wife, Nicole Brown 
Simpson, and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman were discovered two months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The traffic proposal, if passed, could be extended for an additional 18 months 
after the initial period expires. The council is expected to hear the proposals 
Tuesday.

SMALL IS BIG; PERSONAL TOUCH, INNOVATIVE IDEAS OF LOCAL AD AGENCIES ARE LURING 
CLIENTS AWAY FROM NEW YORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When Diamond Back wanted to peddle a new model, the bicycle manufacturer 
turned to the Westside, one of the advertising industry's emerging hot spots. 
</P>
<P>
 With sales of its mountain bikes sluggish, partly because of a lackluster 
image, Diamond Back this summer hired Ground Zero, a 7-month-old Venice 
advertising agency with just 11 employees -- and a reputation for hip, humorous 
ads. 
</P>
<P>
 Ground Zero developed a bold print ad for Diamond Back -- a bike set against a 
bright yellow background and copy that called the product "the kind of bike 
Einstein would have created if he spent more time outside and less time on that 
silly relativity stuff nobody gets anyway." The ad hit trade magazines last 
week, with consumer publications to follow soon. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a brash move for Diamond Back, which makes about 15% of the mountain 
bikes sold by independent dealers and had previously used far milder, in-house 
advertising. But the company's marketing manager, Imre Barsy, thinks the new 
campaign will spur sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting into developing an attitude," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ground Zero and a handful of other independent ad firms clustered in Santa 
Monica and Venice are developing attitudes for companies around the world, from 
small businesses to mega-corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say the rise of these Westside agencies are part of a broader trend. 
In recent years, clients have drifted away from New York's traditional Madison 
Avenue powerhouses toward smaller, regional firms. Smaller firms have been 
credited with taking more creative risks and paying closer attention to 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting power shift has broad implications for the finicky world of 
consumer advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Kresser/Craig in Santa Monica handles widely seen advertising for Arco 
gasoline, Kinko's copy centers and the State of California. Rubin Postaer & 
Associates, also in Santa Monica, is perhaps best known for the "Excuse me, are 
those Bugle Boy jeans you're wearing?" television commercials and counts the 
American division of Honda among its clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Such agencies follow in the tracks of one of the most famous regional agencies 
ever, Venice-based Chiat/Day, which throughout the 1980s helped pioneer the 
move away from Madison Avenue. Chiat/Day became influential both for its 
aggressive consumer research and such innovative ads as the Energizer bunny. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a move away from some of the larger agencies," said David W. 
Stewart, a professor of marketing at USC and the author of numerous books on 
advertising. "For economies of scale, a lot of clients have moved toward 
smaller niche players that have very good creativity or a more specialized 
approach." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Smith, who at 41 is the oldest of three partners in Ground Zero, puts it 
more bluntly: "The most interesting stuff on the advertising scene is happening 
on a regional basis." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers say that the concentration of prominent regional agencies on 
the Westside is merely coincidental. Yet many others point to the Westside's 
affluence, proximity to media production facilities and an available pool of 
young, hungry talent at Chiat/Day and other large firms who have often been 
hired by or formed their own smaller firms. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also industry changes behind the trend. Blue-chip Madison Avenue 
agencies such as Ogilvy & Mather and McCann-Erickson are increasingly viewed as 
lumbering dinosaurs by both clients and analysts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The larger agencies are more cautious and have more layers of management," 
Stewart said. "It creates a homogenizing effect to the advertising." 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at large agencies say they have more resources available to their 
clients, and can often place advertisements on TV networks and in magazines, a 
task smaller agencies often must assign to outside specialists. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even big agencies realize that some advertisers prefer the close attention 
they can receive at a regional agency -- and the control they can exert because 
they often are responsible for a large chunk of the agency's account. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a small agency, there's greater attention by the senior people. You're not 
lost in this maze of lots of clients," said Joel Hochberg, general manager of 
the West Los Angeles office of Foote, Cone & Belding, a big nationwide agency 
that handles Mattel toys and Sunkist fruits, among other accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 But the biggest reason for the rise of regional agencies may be that companies 
are recognizing something consumer advocates have been saying for years: In 
general, one brand is as good as another. So the key to success is in the 
marketing. 
</P>
<P>
 Kresser/Craig was able to work that idea to its client's advantage as it 
researched consumer attitudes for a new spot for Arco gasoline, which is 
relatively inexpensive. The resulting TV commercial shows a montage of everyday 
folks smiling, working and playing while Carly Simon sings and actor Keith 
Carradine, in voice-over, calls Arco "the West's favorite gasoline." 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people on the surface will tell you all major oil gas companies are 
about the same, there's not much difference," said Bob Kresser, Kresser/Craig 
chairman and chief executive officer. "But if you probe people a little more 
deeply, they do have doubts about a quality difference because the price is 
lower. The truth is, they are all about the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "Through our research, we were able to figure out that when we let people know 
that Arco sells a lot of gas and passes the savings along, the quality 
perception changes dramatically. They think, 'If more people buy it, it must be 
OK.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Admitted Gerry Rubin, partner at Rubin Postaer: "There's very little 
differentiation between brands or products anymore. The only difference is in 
image. So clients are in a more searching mode. The answers can come from any 
resource -- big, small or unusual. Creativity has no license." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At Ground Zero that point is well illustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 An aggressive, youth-oriented agency, Ground Zero claims to have racked up at 
least $35 million in annual billings from prestigious clients ranging from 
Future Kids, a Los Angeles-based computer training firm, to Disney home video. 
(Executives at larger, rival agencies questioned the accuracy of Ground Zero's 
figures.) 
</P>
<P>
 Ground Zero's offices, in a funky walk-up atop a restaurant, just a block from 
the beach, pay homage to the pop culture often reflected in the group's work. 
Electric guitars are mounted on the walls, a small pool table occupies a 
corridor between offices and 20-something staffers wearing baggy jeans and 
baseball caps creak about on hardwood floors. 
</P>
<P>
 In this environment, Smith and his partners -- Kirk Souder, 32, and Court 
Crandall, 29 -- embark on their missions to, in their oft-quoted mantra, "find 
the soul of a brand." 
</P>
<P>
 Souder and Crandall had been a hot creative team at Brentwood-based Stein 
Robaire Helm, doing award-winning work for Teva sports sandals and the Los 
Angeles Museum of Contemporary Art. The British-born Smith had managed the Los 
Angeles office of New York-based Lord, Dentsu & Partners, the kind of big, 
multinational agency he now sees as old hat. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's strategy is to try to zero in on the most compelling reason 
consumers might want a product -- as opposed to just ticking off some facts 
about the brand -- and then convey that message in a wry or emotionally 
compelling way. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Disney home video campaign, the agency will avoid showing clips of 
animation and instead build a spot around a mother watching her child watch a 
video. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not about how great the animation is," Souder said. "What it's really 
about is the connection between mother and child. It gets to the essence of why 
we buy things, the emotional reason we go for one thing or another." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet this approach does not always succeed. Bob Spivak, the founder of the 
Daily Grill, a Brentwood-based chain of six restaurants in Southern California, 
said he was disappointed with Ground Zero's initial campaign billing his 
restaurants as "L.A.'s great American meal." 
</P>
<P>
 Two cable TV spots showed chaotic street scenes of New York City or people 
screaming aboard a flight bound for the East Coast. The point was that patrons 
should not have to travel to New York for good American cuisine. But Spivak 
said some viewers were put off by the ads' tone and message. 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider us a very humble restaurant chain," Spivak said. "If we were 
offending people because of negative references to New York or planes dropping 
out of the sky, it bothered me." He said he is much more pleased with a second 
phase done by Ground Zero and estimated sales are up by 8% to 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Regional agencies face other challenges as well. Executives disagree about the 
future of highly touted interactive advertising, in which computer users could 
interact with ad messages on their monitor, and "direct e-mail" -- ad pitches 
sent via modem. Pressure to consolidate services and offer clients "one-stop 
shopping" has led to mergers. For instance, Stein Robaire Helm, plagued by both 
staff and client defections, is discussing merging with Kresser/Craig. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet industry insiders expect the trend toward regional agencies to, well, keep 
going and going and going . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We are downsizing the largest corporations, initiating more and more small 
businesses," said Bob Kresser. "The trend in the country is toward smaller and 
more regional. Why would the hiring of agencies be any different?" Some Winning 
Pitches

DUNES: RESTORATION PROVIDES THE REAL JOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was sad to see the article about the destruction of the El Segundo Dunes 
(July 31, page 3) by a "joy rider" and the response of Mr. Ward in the letters 
section (Aug. 11). 
</P>
<P>
 The Dunes Restoration program has been one of the best-run and most fun 
programs I've ever volunteered for in Los Angeles.Every three weeks Rhapsody in 
Green would call us and entertain us while we worked with their great jokes and 
good humor. Dr. Rudi Mattori would bring in local experts to provide scientific 
lectures, and then we all pulled together to weed and replant. Many times we 
would come across fascinating native species that have survived in this area. 
Volunteers ranged from college and high school students to families to singles 
from all parts of the city. I hope this program keeps going, and that the 
off-road "joy rider" and Mr. Ward could join us just one time and see the real 
joy of the El Segundo Dunes.

AIRPORT: PILOT SAYS NOISE RULES ARE OBSERVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re: Santa Monica Airport Noise article (Aug. 14, page 3). 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica Airport distributes to pilots an impressive brochure that clearly 
defines departure and arrival routes required to reduce neighborhood noise.In 
my experience, and contrary to your observations, most departing pilots do fly 
over Penmar Golf Course for noise reduction even though this low altitude 
turning maneuver may increase potential flight hazards. During a recent 
check-out, my instructor was most adamant about following noise abatement 
procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Your article didn't address reverse noise pollution. Airport Boulevard is 
within sight of my hangar and a recent day spent working on my plane included a 
constant assault by: 
</P>
<P>
 * Roaring motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Muffler-less automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Thundering garbage trucks that actually shook my hangar doors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Auto tire testing conducted on an adjacent parking lot that screeched its 
way forever into my ringing ears. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pounding rock and rap music from car stereo systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout several hours of this, I rarely heard an airplane. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet I'm not aware of any pilots' groups protesting this ground-generated 
discord forced upon this pilot by our good neighbors.

WEST HOLLYWOOD: PRAISE FOR CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I would like to thank and congratulate the West Hollywood City Council on 
their recent deliberations on social service program spending for the next 
fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 While under immense pressure and frustration, they performed with eloquence 
and perseverance; perseverance in maintaining current levels of commitment to 
the many essential organizations and programs that serve the residents of West 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 I am particularly grateful to see my tax dollars go to such organizations as 
Project Angel Food, AID for AIDS and various senior programs whose work we 
could hardly live without. While government on higher levels seems to 
accomplish less and less as each budget is deliberated, I am satisfied that 
this council has made its social commitment to the residents of West Hollywood 
a sacred entity. 
</P>
<P>
 I do not often compliment the council on their actions, but I would like to 
thank Mayor Abbe Land, Pro-Tem John Hellman and council members Paul Koretz, 
Steve Martin and Sal Guarriello for a job well done.

NOTEBOOK / SEAN WATERS; PEPPERDINE BASKETBALL PROGRAM GETS A BOOST WITH SIGNING 
OF MARCACCINI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Monte Marcaccini, who gave up a basketball scholarship to Indiana to play in 
Italy last summer, signed last week with Pepperdine. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcaccini, 19, was The Times' San Fernando Valley player of the year in 1993 
while at Sherman Oaks Notre Dame High. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the first player signed by new Wave Coach Tony Fuller. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-6 Marcaccini averaged about 25 points a game for the Benetton 
United Colors, which won the Italian junior national championship. He led Notre 
Dame to the Southern Section Division III-A championship in 1993, averaging 
19.7 points and 11.4 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcaccini turned down a scholarship offer from UCLA to sign with Indiana, but 
decided to play in Italy before the start of the 1993 fall semester. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he played for an Italian amateur team, Marcaccini will have four years 
of eligibility at Pepperdine.

 Dorsey High continues to be a pipeline of talent for the West L.A. football 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Oilers began practice Aug. 15, 20% of the team's players came from 
Dorsey. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Dons include Norman Ysaguirre, a two-time All-City Section tackle, 
defensive backs E.Z. Anderson, tackle Wakiee Brady and running back Chris 
Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
 Other newcomers include receiver Antonio Carrion, running back Jermaine 
Gibson, linebacker Derrick Ridgeway, receivers Chris Miller and Rashad Turner 
and defensive backs Ghali Wadood, Jesse Belvin and Max Kaleem. 
</P>
<P>
 Returning former Dons include linebacker Dempster Jackson, kicker Omar Moreno 
and running backs Ronald Peebles and Maurice Collins. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers also employ former Dorsey assistants Darryl Holmes, Tracy Atkins 
and Eugene McAdoo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers, 3-8-1 in 1993, are scheduled to scrimmage against Mt. San Jacinto 
College and University of Redlands on Sept. 3 at Redlands. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been fortunate to attract their assistant coaches and their players," 
Coach Rob Hager said.

NUMBER 44 HAS DOUBLE MEANING FOR COUGARS' SAADAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Thursday, almost 1 1/2 years after losing his left hand in a pipe bomb 
explosion, Payam Saadat will wear uniform No. 44 to honor his deceased teammate 
when the Washington State Cougars play Illinois at Chicago's Soldier Field. 
</P>
<P>
 The former St. Monica High standout was injured and his friend and teammate 
Harvey M. (Buddy) Waldron IV was killed when a bomb they constructed exploded 
in Waldron's truck in Pullman, Wash., on April 19, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "For all that I went through, no one gave me a chance to be back on the 
field," said the 21-year-old Saadat, who was not charged in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I walk on the field wearing his number, I will be playing for two 
people -- me and the spirit of him inside me." 
</P>
<P>
 Hard work and determination made Saadat and Waldron football players. 
Curiosity and poor judgment cost them dearly. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the accident, they were junior non-scholarship players who rarely saw 
action in varsity games and never made the sports pages. Saadat played in one 
varsity game each during his sophomore and junior seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the explosion -- and the headlines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were being curious and mischievous," Saadat said. "I'm not going to say, 
'I didn't want to do it.' We were just going to lay it in the wheat field and 
let it go off. We meant no harm." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Saadat and Waldron assembled a bomb at Saadat's apartment using an 
8-inch-long, 1 1/2-inch wide galvanized pipe, filled with gunpowder and wired 
to an alarm clock. They had planned to detonate it in a wheat field outside 
Pullman. 
</P>
<P>
 The bomb had a 30-minute delay and the two planned to watch it explode from 
Saadat's apartment on a hillside. 
</P>
<P>
 Saadat told police that he held the bomb in his lap while Waldron drove his 
1978 Plymouth Trail Duster. Saadat said they heard a sizzle when Waldron 
stopped the truck in the 300 block of Irving Street about 11:15 p.m. on April 
19, 1993, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Saadat checked the wires, the bomb exploded in his lap and the utility 
vehicle went into motion when Waldron's foot slipped off the brake and onto the 
accelerator, police reports state. 
</P>
<P>
 "The car was never in park," Saadat said. "We ran on top of another (parked) 
car. That's what stopped the vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
 Saadat was taken to Pullman Memorial Hospital and then flown by helicopter to 
Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, where he was treated for 11 days. In 
addition to losing his left hand two inches below the wrist, he suffered burns 
to his left leg, which needed four skin grafts, and nearly lost his right hand, 
a hospital official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Waldron, 22, of Bellevue, Wash., died from head injuries at Sacred Heart 
Medical Center in Spokane, Wash., a day after the explosion, according to the 
Spokane County coroner's office. A piece of shrapnel entered his skull through 
his right eye, causing brain damage, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pullman police conducted a joint investigation with the Bureau of Alcohol, 
Tobacco and Firearms. While searching Saadat's apartment, Detective Chris 
Tennant of the Pullman Police Department said another bomb and bomb-making 
materials were discovered. A book called "Poor Man's James Bond" was also 
found. "It was a book on bombs with the page turned to how to make time bombs," 
Tennant said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a one-year investigation, the case was dismissed and no charges were 
filed at the federal, state or county levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Saadat joined Washington State as a non-scholarship player in 1990 after 
playing four seasons at St. Monica High under Coach Angelo Jackson. He was a 
two-year starting offensive guard and captain of the Mariners' 1989 team, which 
won the Santa Fe League championship. He played on the Cougars' junior varsity 
team and appeared in varsity games against Oregon State in 1991 and against 
Temple in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 As a redshirt last season, Saadat took part in winter conditioning. By March, 
he was working out in pads during spring drills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I overcame the biggest thing and that's the mental part of losing my hand," 
Saadat said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saadat, a five-year varsity walk-on, will be a second-string middle linebacker 
used in passing situations and backup on all special teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is an inspiration to the players and the coaches," Washington State 
defensive coordinator Bill Doba said. "What he lacks in athletic ability, he 
makes up with hard work and determination. If he had more speed, he would be a 
starter." 
</P>
<P>
 When Saadat returned to fall practice Aug. 11, he was admired by his teammates 
for showing courage to come back and play. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I drop a ball, defensive players holler at me. They have not excluded me 
because of my handicap, but they also aren't giving me any special favors." 
</P>
<P>
 During a scrimmage, Saadat intercepted a pass from one of his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're probably the only team in the country to put a kid with one hand in the 
game for passing situations," Doba said. But "he's been around for five seasons 
and he knows our defensive package as well as anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Saadat has trouble talking about the incident and has avoided his St. Monica 
classmates and teachers since he returned home last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I pretty much avoided everyone but my family and closest friends when I came 
back to Santa Monica," he said. "I needed time to do my own thing and get my 
life back on track." 
</P>
<P>
 Waldron's parents have helped ease Saadat's guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hard, naturally, to see them," said Saadat, who met Waldron's parents 
only four days before the accident at their home. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came to see me in the hospital and treated me like they were second 
parents. We still keep in touch." 
</P>
<P>
 Saadat has regained the 30 pounds he lost while recovering in the hospital. 
Using a prosthetic hook on his left arm, Saadat is able to lift weights at 6 
every morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Saadat wears a bullet-shaped shell over his left stump, which is covered by a 
jelly-filled lining and another shell. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't know how much you use two hands until you lose one of them," said 
Saadat, who is right-handed. "I struggle with everything from tying my shoes to 
putting on my clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The toughest part is being patient and not get aggravated," he said. "I 
understand now that it takes 10 minutes for me to tie my shoe." 
</P>
<P>
 The one thing that can't be replaced is the loss of his friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buddy and I had a good relationship," Saadat said. "He pushed me and I pushed 
him. When they told me he had died, I felt another piece of me was gone."

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; BROWN ACCUSES WILSON OF MISMANAGING LOTTERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIRGINIA ELLIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Using an elementary school as her backdrop, gubernatorial challenger Kathleen 
Brown accused the Wilson Administration on Wednesday of mismanaging the 
California Lottery and cheating the state's education system out of millions of 
dollars in revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, citing recent criticism by the state auditor of the lottery's handling 
of a $600-million computer contract, accused the agency of blatantly favoring 
one company -- GTECH of Rhode Island -- in what she said amounted to "apparent 
bid rigging" that cost the state about $62 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more suspicious, she said, was that the lottery's actions on the contract 
came after the company had employed some of Gov. Pete Wilson's "closest 
cronies" as consultants or lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our California Lottery should not be some political roulette wheel where 
Wilson's powerful friends are the winners and our kids are the losers," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's campaign spokesman, Dan Schnur, showed up before the news conference 
and distributed a news release that showed that lottery sales this fiscal year 
have increased $600 million over last year. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Brown had deliberately overlooked the sales record and distorted the 
audit findings. "Not only are Kathleen Brown's charges absolutely ludicrous, 
but the findings she attributes to the (auditor) don't even exist," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack from Brown, staged with schoolchildren playing in the background, 
is part of a continuing campaign strategy to paint Wilson as an inept 
administrator whose mismanagement of the bureaucracy has led to waste and a 
reduction of government services. At the same time, Brown tried to portray 
herself as an efficient manager who would force the bureaucracy to perform more 
efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilson campaign tried to use Brown's news event to play out its own 
strategy, which is to make the state treasurer appear as a neophyte who doesn't 
understand government. "Once again, Kathleen Brown has shown the people of 
California how little she understands about how state government works," Schnur 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, both sides were able to score against each other. 
</P>
<P>
 The state auditor has criticized the lottery for its handling of the computer 
contract, one of the largest in state history. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report released last month, the auditor found that the agency's bid 
specifications had so favored GTECH that no other company was willing to 
compete for the contract. As a result, the auditor found that GTECH won the 
contract without competitive bidding. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, however, made a mistake in saying that the auditor had suggested that 
former Wilson Administration officials, later employed by GTECH, may have 
violated conflict-of-interest laws. The audit made no mention of 
conflict-of-interest laws or any roles played by officials from Wilson's 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 But three former officials in the Administration have had connections with 
GTECH. After working in Wilson's first gubernatorial campaign, Joe Rodota and 
Marty Wilson became consultants and each separately worked on a contract for 
GTECH. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodota, after severing his ties with the Rhode Island company, accepted a job 
in the Wilson Administration. He has since left to work on the governor's 
reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 A third official -- Terrance Flanigan -- quit the Wilson Administration to 
become a lobbyist and accepted GTECH as a main client.

LIBERALS AND RELIGION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I see that Brenda Allaman from the Radical Religious Right has sent in a 
"Godless-liberals-are-picking-on-us-Christians-because-we're-becoming-politically-involved" 
letter (Aug. 15).It's full of name calling, distortions and untruths. 
</P>
<P>
 The attempt to demonize liberals by claiming they are anti-religious is 
laughable. There's nothing mutually exclusive about being religious and being 
liberal. Jesse Jackson and Jimmy Carter are both devout Christians and are 
about as liberal as they come.

A SHOT IN ARM FOR NORTHRIDGE; BASEBALL: GENTILE PITCHES VALLEY SQUAD INTO U.S. 
CHAMPIONSHIP GAME WITH ONE-HITTER, 2-0. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A pitch called the Agony produced pure ecstasy for Northridge on Wednesday 
night in the Little League World Series, vaulting the Western Region 
representative into today's United States championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolstered by the faith from his manager, Justin Gentile pitched a one-hitter 
to lift Northridge to a 2-0 victory over Springfield, Va., before 17,500 at 
Howard J. Lamade Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Gentile, a right-hander with an overhand delivery, mixed fastballs with a 
change-up he has affectionately named the Agony to strike out 13. Eric Miller 
singled to lead off the first inning but Gentile allowed only two walks the 
rest of the way and another batter reached base on an error. 
</P>
<P>
 At least Springfield didn't agonize for long: The game lasted 1 hour 31 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge (19-1, 2-1 in series pool play) will face Springfield (17-2, 2-1) 
again today for the U.S. championship at 1:30 PDT. The game will be televised 
on ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
 Maracaibo, Venezuela, and Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, will meet today at 10:30 a.m. 
PDT for the International championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners will play in the World Series championship Saturday at 1 p.m. PDT. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathaniel Dunlap will start today for Northridge. Dunlap also throws the 
Agony. In fact, he taught it to Gentile two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "They both grip it with their thumb and pinky finger, and their other fingers 
are off the ball," said Jon Gentile, Justin's father. "The way Justin throws 
over the top, the ball has the same rotation as his fastball but tumbles down 
like a drop pitch." 
</P>
<P>
 The pitch, in fact, was mistaken for a curve by several onlookers, including 
Springfield Manager Jim Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
 "That kid fooled us all day with that slow curve," he said. "I don't know when 
I've seen so many strikeouts." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, 13 has been Northridge's recurring number. Dunlap struck out 13 in a 
4-2 loss to Brooklyn Center, Minn., on Monday night, and Peter Tuber struck out 
13 in a 6-4 victory over Middleboro, Mass., on Tuesday, giving Northridge 
pitchers 39 strikeouts in 18 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap, a 5-foot-11 right-hander whose fastball has been blocked at more than 
70 m.p.h., was eligible to pitch Wednesday. And his teammates knew it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to (Manager Larry Baca) last night and told him that the other guys 
wanted Nathaniel to pitch, and that it was OK with me," Gentile said. "But he 
told he had confidence in me." 
</P>
<P>
 Gentile was not able to complete the first inning of the Western Regional 
final against Hawaii last week, leaving with the bases loaded and two out after 
giving up three runs. Northridge rallied to win, 17-7. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the only time he's had trouble all year," Baca said. "The kid can 
pitch, and I told him that when he came to me last night." 
</P>
<P>
 Gentile also helped Northridge score its first run. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third inning he followed a single by Michael Frost and a fielder's 
choice by Gregg Wallis with a single past third base, setting up a run-scoring 
single by Dunlap. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge added a run in the sixth when Matt Fisher scored on a sacrifice fly 
to center field by Frost. Fisher singled with one out and advanced to third on 
a single by Matt Cassel. 
</P>
<P>
 Gentile struck out at least two batters in every inning, and no runner reached 
second base after Miller advanced on a wild pitch in the first. Cassel dropped 
a short, hard throw from second baseman Frost with two out in the sixth, but 
Mike Fratoe flew out to left fielder Scott Drake Jr. to end the game.

 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 In international pool play, Maracaibo won all three games, including a 3-0 
victory over Glace Bay, Nova Scotia, on Wednesday. In somewhat of a surprise, 
Dhahran defeated Taiwan, 3-2, to finish 2-1 in pool play. Taiwan finished 1-2 
and Glace Bay was 0-3.

WOODS, OH, HARRIS ADVANCE AFTER FIRST MATCHES IN U.S. AMATEUR 
</P>

<P>
 Tiger Woods of Cypress and Ted Oh of Torrance were among 32 winners Wednesday 
in the first round of the U.S. Amateur Golf Championship at TPC of Sawgrass. 
</P>
<P>
 Also advancing was defending champion John Harris. 
</P>
<P>
 Woods, 18, closed out Vaughn Moise, a PGA Tour rules official from Kingwood, 
Tex., when Moise put his tee shot in the water on the famous island par-three 
17th at the Stadium Course. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, 17, chipped in for a birdie-three on 18 to tie his match with Alan Bratton 
of College Station, Tex., and then won with a par on the first extra hole in 
one of the eight first-round matches that went past 18 holes. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, a 41-year-old insurance salesman from Edina, Minn., won three of the 
first four holes from Jason Smoak of Whitestone, S.C., and went on to a 7-and-6 
victory. Harris was five under par when he closed out the match with a par on 
No. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Talt, 48, a mortgage broker from Laguna Beach, lost his first-round 
match, 5 and 4, to Tim Jackson of Germantown, Tenn. Talt had to survive a 
playoff Wednesday morning to advance to match play.

BULLFROGS CATCH THEIR BREATH IN TIME TO ELIMINATE THE BLADES; ROLLER HOCKEY: 
DOWN THREE GOALS, THEY COME BACK FOR 9-8 VICTORY AND ADVANCE TO WESTERN 
CONFERENCE FINALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Displaying their championship grit, the Bullfrogs rallied from a three-goal 
third-quarter deficit to defeat the Blades, 9-8, in Game 2 of a Roller Hockey 
International playoff game before 6,156 Wednesday night at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Gervais scored four goals to lead the Bullfrogs, but Rick Judson scored 
the biggest one, the game-winner with 51.7 seconds remaining off a backhand 
pass from Yuri Krivokhija. Then the Bullfrogs relied on goalie Rob Laurie to 
hold off a flurry of shots in the final 50 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I just got off the Batman ride at Magic Mountain," Bullfrog Coach 
Grant Sonier said. "The game was an emotional roller-coaster. We were like a 
heavyweight fighter on the ropes, but somewhere we found our second wind." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs won the Pacific Division final series two games to none to 
advance to the Western Conference championship series. They will play Game 2 of 
that series Aug. 30 at The Pond of Anaheim against the winner of the 
Portland-Calgary game in the Northwest Division finals. Game 1 has not been 
scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blades finished the regular season with the best record in the Western 
Conference. But after sweeping San Diego in the first round of the playoffs, 
the Bullfrogs eliminated them from the playoffs for the second consecutive 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a good team," Blades Coach Bobby Hull Jr. said of the Bullfrogs, 
the 1993 RHI champions. "It was a tough way to lose, going into the last few 
seconds with a tie. But they got an opportunity and they didn't miss." 
</P>
<P>
 The Blades didn't miss much in the third quarter, playing fast-break hockey to 
score six goals. A three-goal outburst during a 23-second span gave the Blades 
control of the game at that point. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Charron, who had three goals, scored twice in 13 seconds to give the 
Blades their first lead, 5-4, with 6 minutes 38 seconds remaining in the third 
quarter. Steve Ross scored one goal and Steve Wilson, who had two goals and two 
assists, added two on the power play to make it 8-5 with 1:52 left in the 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what happened in that quarter," Laurie said. "We were a little 
flat-footed and I got flustered. But the guys didn't quit." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullfrogs started their rally behind Gervais. His fourth goal of the game, 
his 11th of the playoffs, cut the lead to two with 1:50 remaining, then Jim 
Brown scored 27 seconds later to make it 8-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Kerr, who was called for five minor penalties, gained some redemption by 
scoring the tying goal on a long slap shot with 9:53 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without Victor and Jim, I'm in no position to score the tying goal," Kerr 
said. "I could have been the goat without those guys. The comeback is just 
indicative of our hockey team. We find a way to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie paved the way, stopping 42 of 50 shots for his fourth consecutive 
victory. Laurie has not lost to the Blades in seven starts and he outplayed his 
counterpart, Max Mikhailovsky, the RHI most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
 With the score tied, 8-8, forward Mike Doers had a chance to put the Blades 
ahead but Laurie smothered his shot from the left slot area late in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Darren Langdon continued his strong play, finishing with a goal and two 
assists for the Bullfrogs. 
</P>

ROLLER HOCKEY; BULLFROGS RALLY TO BEAT BLADES AND WIN SERIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Who needs baseball when you have roller hockey? 
</P>
<P>
 That was the opinion of most of the 6,156 who watched Anaheim's Rick Judson 
score the winning goal with 51 seconds left to give the Bullfrogs a 
come-from-behind, 9-8 victory over the Los Angeles Blades in a Roller Hockey 
International playoff game Wednesday night at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Judson's score capped a six-goal second-half rally for Anaheim and sent the 
Bullfrogs into the Western Conference finals against the winner of the 
Northwest Division series between Portland and Calgary. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams started slowly in a low-scoring first half, in which Victor Gervais 
scored two goals to help the Bullfrogs take a 3-2 lead at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim extended the lead to 4-2 on a goal by Steve Beadle and appeared to 
have control of the game. But that was before the Blades scored three goals 
during a 23-second stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Callahan got things going with a goal to cut the Bullfrogs' lead to one 
goals and Craig Charron scored two unassisted goals within a span of 13 seconds 
to give the Blades a 5-4 lead. Steve Wilson scored the Blades' fourth goal in a 
row 2 1/2 minutes later to make it 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 After Gervais scored to make the score 6-5, the Blades got goals from Steve 
Ross and Wilson to take an 8-5 lead with two minutes remaining in the third 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Roller Hockey International playoff rules, Anaheim, which held a 1-0 
lead in the two-game series, was about to play a 12-minute mini-game following 
regulation when the Bullfrogs turned to Gervais. 
</P>
<P>
 Gervais, who has led Anaheim in scoring the last two seasons, responded with 
his fourth goal of the game. The Bulldogs then made the game interesting when 
Jim Brown scored with 38 seconds remaining in the period to cut the Blades' 
lead to 8-7. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think we would give up, because we had nothing to lose," Gervais 
said. "One thing was for sure. We didn't want to go into another game."

GO FOR GIN FIZZLES; AMERICAN CHANCE WINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Go For Gin's return to racing Wednesday at Saratoga was short, but not sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kentucky Derby winner's third-place finish in the seven-furlong Forego 
Handicap, however, was a useful prep for his fall campaign, which will include 
the 1 1/8-mile Woodward and the Jockey Club Gold Cup and Breeders' Cup Classic, 
each at 1 1/4 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 American Chance, scoring his first stakes victory of the year, took the lead 
from pace-setting Evil Bear with a little more than a sixteenth of a mile 
remaining and won by one length. Go For Gin finished three-quarters of a length 
behind Evil Bear. 
</P>
<P>
 Go For Gin went off as the 9-5 second choice to 8-5 Virginia Rapids in his 
first start against older horses and his first race since finishing second to 
Tabasco Cat in the Belmont Stakes June 11. He also finished second to Tabasco 
Cat in the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
 It also was the first time Go For Gin has raced at less than a mile since 
finishing fifth in a six-furlong maiden race in the first start of his 13-race 
career in September at Belmont Park and was the first time he has raced at less 
than 1 1/8 miles in his last six starts. 
</P>
<P>
 "He finished up real well, but I'm disappointed that we didn't win," said 
Chris McCarron, Go For Gin's jockey. "But he seemed to come out very well." 
</P>
<P>
 Said trainer Nick Zito: "I just wanted a clean trip. This horse should have 
won today. I have to ask McCarron about that. He came fast through the lane, 
and the Woodward still is next for him." 
</P>
<P>
 American Chance, ridden by Pat Day, the rider of Tabasco Cat, raced the 
distance in 1:22 3/5 under 117 pounds. Evil Bear, 114, was ridden by Carlos 
Lopez.

AROUND THE SOUTH BAY: 'MIRACLE CAT' JUSTINE SEEMS DESTINED TO MAKE FULL USE OF 
ALL NINE LIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 THE CAT COMES BACK: She just keeps going . . . and going . . . and going. 
</P>
<P>
 Justine, who has roamed the rustic book stacks at the Either/Or Bookstore in 
Hermosa Beach for more than a decade, recently has waged a battle against 
pancreatic cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 That is only the latest misfortune to strike the short-haired 13-year-old 
black cat, who suns frequently on the latest copies of GQ magazine near the 
front of the shop on Pier Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 About a decade ago, Justine's beautiful black coat was pelted with white 
enamel paint sprayed from a curb-painting machine that passed the storefront, 
said manager Peter Pott. Veterinarians had to shave nearly half the hair on her 
body. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, about 14 months ago, Justine underwent surgery for pancreatic cancer 
after a small tumor was found near her belly. She survived, only to be attacked 
three weeks later by a big dog on a long leash. The dog bit Justine's head and 
broke her jaw. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought they'd probably put her to sleep," said veterinarian Alice 
Villalobos, who has treated Justine for nearly a decade. Instead, Justine's 
owner asked that veterinarians wire her jaw shut, and the cat recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 That was not all. During the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, a stack of books 
fell near her, and she was taken to the vet for observation. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, last month, Justine underwent surgery again for pancreatic cancer. She 
is undergoing chemotherapy and taking herbal medication "to balance her 
emotions as part of a holistic approach," Villalobos said. Signs are 
encouraging: The cancer has gone into remission, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's the miracle cat," Villalobos said. "It's just amazing." 
</P>

 OUT IN A BREEZE: When the winds start to blow, John King starts to feel good 
vibes. 
</P>
<P>
 An avid windsurfer, King's pager vibrates every time gusts are just right to 
get out on the water, even if he is on the job as a Hughes Aircraft Co. 
business administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 The Manhattan Beach resident has wired himself into a new service, Call of the 
Wind, that pages customers when local wind conditions reach 13 m.p.h. -- nearly 
perfect for windsurfing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to waste half a day driving to a beach to find no wind," King said. 
</P>
<P>
 No more. The service, which started a year and a half ago, monitors breezes at 
14 of California's most spectacular windsurfing locales, from Seal Beach to the 
Sacramento River Delta. 
</P>
<P>
 The wind speeds are measured by an anemometer, a gauge that sends digital 
information to an automated voice machine. The wind readings are updated every 
eight seconds. The company charges its customers $16 to $21 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 For King, it's worth it. He sometimes leaves work early to windsurf off of 
Cabrillo Beach in San Pedro, and the device has saved hours of fruitless 
travel. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as it beeps, I'm gone," King said. "And within 45 minutes I'm on the 
water. It's great."  
</P>
<P>

<P>
 THE BIG HOUSE: Even by Palos Verdes Estates standards, the Chen family's new 
home is a big place. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, their Via Visalia residence is believed to be the largest in the 
South Bay. It is a whopping 28,000 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners are Tei Fu Chen and his wife, Oi Lin, who own Sunrider 
International, a Torrance-based health food and cosmetics company. The Chens 
and their five children plan to move into the home in the next few weeks, once 
50 or so workers complete landscape and interior design work, said Sunrider 
attorney Bill Grayson. 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-bedroom home includes a pub and a $7,500 koi fish pond, as well as a 
master bedroom that includes an exercise room, according to sources familiar 
with the home. The Chens had another home torn down on their 2.2-acre property 
to make room. 
</P>
<P>
 The price tag? No one is saying. 
</P>
<P>
 But the house probably would be listed at $15 million to $18 million if it 
were sold today, said Jim Zappulla, manager of the RE/Max Rolling Hills 
Estates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chens won't be selling any time soon, however, Grayson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They hope to have the home for a lifetime," he said. 
</P>

 THE GAMBLING KIND: Inglewood's Hollywood Park Casino was giving away money 
last weekend. But only to stars. 
</P>
<P>
 The new casino gave celebrities $500 each and turned them loose with only one 
rule: What you win goes to your favorite charity. 
</P>
<P>
 And win they did. The likes of Tony Curtis, Cheech Marin and James Farentino 
raised more than $24,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cheech (Marin) and Tony (Curtis) kept things going" by joking around and 
keeping things light, casino spokesman Tyrone Smith said. "You'd think they had 
played together all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest winner of the night: Richard Karn of "Home Improvement." He played 
seven-card stud poker and won $5,000 for cancer research and $1,000 for the Los 
Angeles Free Clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Other games of choice for the celebrity gamblers? Texas hold 'em and 
California aces, a new game similar to blackjack in which players work to get 
22 instead of 21. 
</P>
<P>
 QUOTE OF THE WEEK 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel pretty good. I won the right race." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ron Florance, who lost the Republican primary in the 36th Congressional 
District but won a battle against cancer. J3

SCRAP METAL FIRM'S LEASE CREATES A RUCKUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wilmington boat owner Claire Randall used to clean her 39-foot trimaran with a 
magnet. She would pick up tiny metal filings from her deck every time the scrap 
metal company a few hundred feet across the water loaded a ship. 
</P>
<P>
 And she recently bought earplugs to help block the noise made by Hugo 
Neu-Proler's operations at all times of the day and night. 
</P>
<P>
 For two years, Randall and the L.A. Harbor Boatowners Assn. have been battling 
Hugo, the nation's biggest buyer and recycler of cars, refrigerators and other 
metal discards. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Hugo's 27-year lease is up for renewal by the Port of Los Angeles at the 
end of the month, and boat owners are pressuring port officials to require 
noise reduction in the new lease. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has made efforts to curb the airborne dust and metal debris that 
travel from its operations on Terminal Island to neighbors in the Wilmington 
marinas, Randall said. 
</P>
<P>
 But boat owners say Hugo still creates deafening noise when it loads scrap 
metal into cargo ships 35 to 40 times a year because its outdated equipment 
cannot load cargo quietly, Randall said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're asleep at one in the morning when bang . . . it's almost 
indescribable," she said. "It's so loud it invades your thoughts." 
</P>
<P>
 The boat owners want Hugo to buy a modern crane that places metal cargo, 
rather than sending it by conveyor belt to crash and clang into the metal 
hulls, Randall said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other (companies) around have spent millions just to operate legally in 
the port. Hugo could operate legally if they invest in the new loading 
equipment," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's noise regulation, however, does not seem to include a specific 
noise limit for properties such as Hugo that are zoned heaviest industrial and 
are not near a residential zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Hugo officials will not commit to purchasing the new, expensive equipment, but 
say they will continue to look at ways to decrease the noise heard by boat 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at different loading systems," said Hugo General Manager John 
E. Prudent. "Overall, the noise is a tough issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Noise monitored at the property in March, 1993 reached up to 86.9 decibels 
during ship loading. An ambulance siren at 100 feet typically reaches 100 
decibels. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Prudent said the company has added sound-deadening materials to portions of 
its loader and wants to build a wall around the property. And it may eventually 
introduce quieter loading systems, but the new equipment will cost as much as 
$2 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done a lot of work here, and we've got a lot of work to do yet," he 
said. "I want this to be a world-class facility that not only are we proud of, 
but that our neighbors can be proud of too." 
</P>
<P>
 Hugo has been cited dozens of times by several agencies -- including the Los 
Angeles County Fire Department's hazardous waste unit and the California 
Environmental Protection Agency -- for environmental infractions over the 
years. The violations range from allowing metal dust and debris containing 
polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) to blow into the harbor to stockpiling 
contaminated dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 The company still is under investigation by Cal/EPA's Department of Toxic 
Substances Control and the state Regional Water Quality Control Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Hugo disputed some of the citations, but agreed to install water spray systems 
and canvases on its machinery to control dust. It also paved 60% of its 26-acre 
site to make operations cleaner and prevent metal contaminants from soaking 
into the soil. It has also filed a remedial action plan with the water board. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Port officials say they will hold Hugo to environmental regulations by writing 
stringent provisions into a new lease. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the company's past and present environmental concerns will be 
scrutinized in an environmental report, which the port plans to release for 
public comment by October, said Mark Richter assistant director of the port's 
property management division. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything they should be doing to mitigate dust or noise will be incorporated 
as well as a performance schedule to accomplish those," Richter said.  
</P>
<P>
 The port also recently insisted that Hugo place $10 million in an escrow 
account to guarantee that environmental regulations are met. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very sensitive here about contamination issues because we've been 
stuck with some big cleanup bills," port environmental scientist Dennis Hagner 
said.

PITCH TOUTS THE JOYS OF TREATED SEWAGE WATER; RECYCLING: OIL COMPANY 
REPRESENTATIVES ARE TOLD OF POTENTIAL SAVINGS IF USED IN REFINERY COOLING 
TOWERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BENNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Adan Ortega Jr. is trying to sell millions of gallons of treated sewage water, 
and half a dozen oil company engineers from throughout the South Bay have 
gathered at a noisy El Segundo construction site to hear the sales pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 First the water will be treated at a sewage plant across town, he explains. 
Then it will be pumped to the water recycling plant under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "They disinfect it, we'll purify it," Ortega bellows over clanking hammers, 
motoring tractors and buzzing drills where the country's largest water 
recycling plant is scheduled to open in October, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the most glamorous sales job, but Ortega, wearing an Italian-style 
suit, appears comfortable as he walks around the dusty site trying to persuade 
engineers from Arco, Mobil and Unocal that their companies should stop buying 
tap water and switch to recycled sewage water to pump through refinery cooling 
towers. 
</P>
<P>
 The oil company representatives listen carefully as Ortega, public affairs 
manager for West Basin Municipal Water District, and a couple of the district's 
engineers explain how the $200-million water recycling facility will treat 
enough sewage water each year to fill the Los Angeles Coliseum 30 times. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil company officials are concerned the water will not be as clean as tap 
water. Phosphates and ammonia found in the recycled water could corrode 
expensive machinery in oil refineries, which would require costly repairs, they 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a new product, and with a new product you're always going to have 
difficult questions to answer," said Ortega, 31, who also helped Washington 
apple growers market their fruit after the Alar scare and California farmers 
sell grapes during a recent boycott. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ortega insists that recycled water's benefits make it an easy sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past year, he and a dozen other West Basin officials have sold about 
5% of the water that will be pumped out of the plant in a year. Among the 
industries he targets are oil refineries, fabric dyers and cement mixers. About 
40% of the recycled water will be used to irrigate parks, schoolyards and 
cemeteries, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When the recycling plant opens, waste water from the Hyperion Sewage Treatment 
Plant in El Segundo will be pumped into the recycling facility at Sepulveda 
Boulevard and Hughes Way, where it will flow through a series of chambers for 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the water will be pumped under South Bay streets to golf courses, parks 
and industries throughout the area. Officials estimate that 25% of the waste 
water now pumped from the sewage plant into the ocean will be diverted to the 
recycling facility. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where Ortega's sales pitch begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Touting the plant's benefits to the environment, Ortega warns that Southern 
California's reliance on imported water is precarious, especially during 
drought years. He says the plant's success could eventually "drought-proof" the 
South Bay by freeing up millions of gallons of imported water for other uses. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, he tries to sell industry officials on the economic benefits to 
buying recycled water. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The water costs roughly 30% less than potable water. For companies like 
Chevron Oil Co., which has a large refinery in El Segundo that uses an 
estimated 60% of the city's water, such savings can add up quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevron officials say the refinery plans to use some of the recycled water at 
its El Segundo plant but has yet to decide how much. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Mobil, Arco and Unocal are also considering whether their 
companies should purchase the recycled water, which has never been used in 
refinery cooling towers, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to be paving new ground," said Ernie P. Hamann an Arco engineer 
who has studied the issue for more than a year. "That's why all of us are 
approaching it cautiously." 
</P>
<P>
 The company is considering purchasing about 15% of the water used in its 
Carson refinery from the recycling plant, Hamann says. 
</P>
<P>
 To ease the concerns of oil company engineers, West Basin officials plan to 
construct a $9-million facility to remove ammonia and phosphates from the 
recycled water. As a result, the water will require fewer chemical treatments 
once it reaches the refineries.

POLITICAL NOTES: EX-COUNCILMAN WINS A KEY RACE -- AGAINST CANCER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 FAST RECOVERY: Former Palos Verdes Estates Councilman Ron Florance returned 
home this week after cancer surgery.  
</P>
<P>
 It was an experience, he said, that put a lot of things into perspective, 
including his loss to Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks in the 36th 
Congressional District Republican primary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a lucky camper," Florence said. "I'm clean (of cancer). I caught it soon 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Florance underwent a routine physical exam earlier this summer before he and 
his wife set out on a monthlong vacation. When they returned, Florance's doctor 
called with test results and recommended that he undergo surgery as soon as 
possible to remove three polyps from his colon. One was malignant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel pretty good," Florance said. "I won the right race." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 PRIMARY DEJA VU: Florance, meanwhile, says that he has no plans to endorse 
either Brooks or incumbent Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills) in the November 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 "The primary's over," he said. "I don't want my name bandied around that I am 
endorsing anyone when I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
 Florance asked Brooks to stop saying just that in a letter he wrote to her 
campaign just before his surgery. According to friends of Florance, Brooks told 
a Croatian American Assn. gathering that the two politicians "have been friends 
in the past, still are friends and Ron Florance is now supporting Susan Brooks 
for Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 "I had never met you, or established any type of relationship (before the 
primary campaign)," Florance said in his letter. "During the primary, I think 
it is fair to say no friendship was created." 
</P>
<P>
 But Brooks denies ever saying that she had his endorsement.

 "My only public comment is that you have been a good Republican and that I 
would like your support," she said in a letter she sent to him last week. She 
added that he could view a videotape of the event to see for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Both candidates have communicated only by mail since their bitter primary 
race. During the campaign, Brooks questioned Florance's business background. 
Florance said that Brooks was engaged in a smear campaign.

<P>
 NAME THAT TUNE: During the primary, State Sen. Ralph C. Dills (D-El Segundo) 
blanketed the South Bay with billboards picturing him tooting a saxophone and 
the slogan "Too Old to Quit." 
</P>
<P>
 Now his Republican challenger, Redondo Beach attorney David Barrett Cohen, has 
a billboard of his own, saxophone and all: "Time to Change the Tune." 
</P>
<P>
 "It captures the people's desire for change," Cohen said. "It's the best way 
to answer Ralph's campaign in kind." 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign so far plans only one billboard, at Western Avenue and 240th 
Street in Harbor City. Dills' campaign, which plans to place about 45 
billboards in the South Bay, called it a ploy. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Cohen) is trying to capitalize on 'Too Old to Quit,' " campaign coordinator 
Tim Mock said. "He's trying to turn it around and make it disadvantageous to 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, don't expect any debates to turn into a matchup between two music 
talents. Cohen concedes that to Dills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really play the sax," he said. "That's the one thing he has over me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 WHAT'S HIS LINE?: On the primary ballot, Cohen listed himself as 
"Attorney/Educator." In the November election, it will be "Business 
Owner/Educator." 
</P>
<P>
 Is this because of the not-so-positive image the public has of attorneys? 
</P>
<P>
 Dills' campaign thinks so. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's certainly part of it," Cohen said. "But I want to get credit for being 
a business owner. I own my own business. With only three words to describe 
yourself, that seemed the most appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 He runs his own law practice in Torrance, he said, a far cry from being a 
corporate lawyer or in a big firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, there's quite a difference," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 LOOKING TO '96: When it comes to municipal elections, Torrance has always done 
things its own way. 
</P>
<P>
 Its municipal election this year was March 8, even though nine South Bay 
cities held elections a month later. 
</P>
<P>
 Come 1996, California will hold its presidential primary on March 26. That's 
just three weeks after Torrance voters will go to the polls and elect their 
city leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cities have changed their election dates so they won't conflict, but 
Torrance probably won't, said City Clerk Sue Herbers. City officials would 
probably have to change the charter to move the election date. Plus, there's no 
guarantee that the California primary in 2000 won't be moved to another date or 
back to June, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes mean that Torrance officials may have to check signatures on 
absentee ballots. Herbers believes that the city won't be able to use the 
county's election booths or polling areas because they will be gearing up for 
the higher-profile primary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be doing more marketing of our local election," Herbers said.

 Four bridges that link communities in the harbor area will be retrofitted in a 
$5.8-million state Department of Transportation project. 
</P>
<P>
 The bridges are Hobson Avenue Bridge, which crosses Pacific Coast Highway in 
Wilmington; Wilmington Bridge, which crosses the highway in Long Beach; Channel 
Street Bridge, which crosses the Harbor Freeway near San Pedro, and Terminal 
Island Bridge, which crosses the Terminal Island Freeway on Terminal Island. 
</P>
<P>
 The projects will bring the bridges up to earthquake safety standards, said 
Caltrans spokesman Rick Holland. 
</P>
<P>
 Steel supports enclosed with steel casings will be built on the bridge 
columns, Holland said, and foundations will be enlarged. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction is expected to start in November and will take about 11 months.

COMMUNITY NEWS: ROLLING HILLS ESTATES; CITY CONSIDERS HIRING NATURALIST FOR 
CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council is considering hiring a professional naturalist to work at a 
proposed nature center near George F Canyon Trail. 
</P>
<P>
 The city already has set aside $112,000 to renovate a 400-square-foot realty 
office that would serve as the nature center. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,000 people a month visit the one-mile nature trail, said Richard Gill, 
community services director. 
</P>
<P>
 A council subcommittee will consider whether the city should pay a naturalist 
directly or allow the naturalist to gather sales commissions from the center's 
gift store. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memo to the council, Councilwoman Susan Seamans said that "a friendly, 
professional and knowledgeable person was crucial to the success of the 
center." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Councilwoman Jacki McGuire said city money should not be used to hire 
a naturalist, in part because the nature center will not attract large numbers 
of visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Work on the building at 27305 Palos Verdes Drive East includes renovating 
restrooms, installing a deck and covering windows to create wall space for 
exhibits. The exhibits will provide information on local plants and geology. 
</P>
<P>
 The outside deck, to be used for teaching, will be more than 800 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Renovations will begin in September when ownership of the property is 
transferred to the city. The center is expected to open by next spring. JEFF 
KASS

COMMUNITY NEWS: TORRANCE; $15 KIT HELPS MERCHANTS DETER PANHANDLERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY GUTHRIE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Police Department and the downtown business community have teamed up to 
discourage people from giving money to panhandlers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided we needed to educate the general public that panhandling was a 
crime," said Officer Don Sherwood. 
</P>
<P>
 He helped design and distribute a "Panhandler Abatement Kit," which contains a 
16- by 24-inch window sign that says "Panhandling Supports Substance Abuse . . 
. Not People!" 
</P>
<P>
 The program came about because some panhandlers were intimidating shoppers in 
the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "One gal, she was just a very angry person. . . . She would beat on their 
cars," Sherwood said. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the program is to get people to give money to charities instead, 
Sherwood said. The kit also contains 25 wallet cards that list South Bay 
agencies that serve needy people. Businesses can encourage people to give out 
the cards rather than spare change. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar anti-panhandling efforts in Hollywood have been controversial. The 
Hollywood Chamber of Commerce sponsored a poster that depicts a young man 
holding a sign that says "Help Me." The headline reads "Meet One of Hollywood's 
Most Successful Actors!"  
</P>
<P>
 The advertisement says that many people who ask for money spend what they 
collect on drugs or alcohol. The posters have been criticized by social service 
agencies for trivializing the plight of the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 But the South Bay Job Center, an organization that serves homeless people, and 
is a member of Downtown Torrance Assn., supports the project. It provided the 
informational cards that come with the package. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very strongly that this is a big positive in helping the homeless in 
getting them the help they need," said Michele May, center executive director. 
"It's not that they are just saying 'Go away,' by any stretch of the 
imagination." 
</P>
<P>
 The $15 kit can be purchased at With You in Mind Boutique, 1326 Sartori Ave.

 After arriving at a church party in their new neighborhood, the couple drifts 
to opposite ends of the get-together. She strikes up a conversation about her 
two children. He talks to a friend about his four children. 
</P>
<P>
 How many children do they have? Members of their new church puzzle over the 
conflicting numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, they add up to five, three from his prior marriage, one they had 
together, and one from her previous marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to the world of step families. Experts say one in three Americans is a 
stepparent, stepchild, step sibling or some other member of a step family. 
</P>
<P>
 As the woman tells her party story to the other members of the Stepfamily 
Solutions group, there are nods and smiles around the table. Most of the adults 
attending the meeting have faced similar complicated equations.  
</P>
<P>
 The Stepfamily Assn. of America sponsors the South Bay chapter of Stepfamily 
Solutions, which meets twice a month at the Hermosa Beach Community Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stepfamily Assn. distributes information through the media, educational 
materials and a quarterly publication. 
</P>
<P>
 Stepfamily Solutions uses the materials as a guide for people who come to the 
free meetings, but the exchanges usually concentrate on the daily problems 
faced by people who are raising children who are not their own. 
</P>
<P>
 To protect their privacy, the participants asked to be identified only by 
their first names. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine months ago, when Connie, 41, married Andy, an 11-year-old boy and 
17-year-old girl from Andy's previous marriage came as part of the package. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never even had a roommate before," Connie told the group a little 
nervously. "I don't know how to be with children." 
</P>
<P>
 Andy squeezes her hand and says that Connie does very well with his kids, 
especially his son, who has a learning disability. The boy spends half his time 
with them, and now the daughter lives with them all the time. Nine months 
earlier the daughter wouldn't even talk to her father. 
</P>
<P>
 Several members of the group laugh out loud when Connie and Andy describe 
negotiating household rules in the bathroom with the shower on full blast for 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by a trained counselor who also has a step family, the group focuses on 
finding ways around the everyday problems of living in a step family. People 
with more serious problems can get referrals to other South Bay social service 
agencies.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MANHATTAN BEACH; TEACHERS TO VOTE ON 3% SALARY BONUS PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BENNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Manhattan Beach teacher representatives tentatively accepted a contract 
proposal after months of wrangling with district administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 The representatives agreed last week to an offer that includes 3% salary 
bonuses for all instructors in both the 1994-95 and 1995-96 school years.The 
teachers overwhelmingly rejected an offer in May that would have left nearly 
one-third of them without a raise for a third year. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the proposal retains the elementary art, music and physical 
education specialists as well as preparation time for elementary school 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers, who earn $25,000 to $51,000 a year, will vote on the proposal next 
month before the start of fall classes, said Supt. Gerald F. Davis. The board 
of education planned to vote on the proposal Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Manhattan Beach Unified officials said in May they could not afford salary 
increases because Of a $1.5-million cut in state funding and a projected 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 But Davis said the district will pay $600,000 in bonuses with interest earned 
from a fund created by the sales of school sites. Under the proposal, the 
bonuses will not be added to the teachers' salary schedules, but a 3% bonus for 
teachers last year will be added to the schedules, Davis said. JAMES BENNING

<P>
 A young Danish tourist was raped twice early Sunday after she was forced from 
a hotel lobby into the back seat of a sedan, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-year-old woman, who was touring the country with at least one friend, 
was dragged from the Hacienda Hotel at 525 N. Sepulveda Blvd. by a gunman who 
moments earlier had robbed a sandwich shop and a copy shop in a mini-mall 
across the street, said El Segundo Police Sgt. Glenn Coles. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect, armed with a semiautomatic handgun, entered the hotel at 12:40 
a.m. Sunday, demanded money and ordered hotel employees and patrons to lie on 
the floor. He then dragged the woman out a back door and fled with $700 cash. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman was forced into a sedan with a waiting driver and raped twice by the 
gunman during a drive through area streets. At one point, the car stopped and 
the driver left, Coles said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman was dropped off two hours later at the intersection of Alondra and 
Lakewood boulevards in Bellflower. She took a taxi back to the hotel before she 
was taken to a local hospital, treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
 She described the suspects' car as a gold or beige full-size American sedan. 
Police hope to release a sketch of the rapist within the next week, Coles said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim has left Southern California but is still in the country, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sunday morning crime spree was the second major crime to rattle the 
normally peaceful city this month. On Aug. 12, a 43-year-old Westchester man 
was shot and robbed after he withdrew $100 from a First Interstate Bank 
automated teller machine at 740 N. Sepulveda Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, Benny Delacruz, is in critical but stable condition at an area 
hospital. Police are studying photographs taken from a bank surveillance camera 
to aid in the identification of a suspect, Coles said. JAMES BENNING

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council on Tuesday turned down a proposal to join a special county 
district that would tax residents to help support their branch of the Los 
Angeles County Library. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Kenneth W. Landau said the unanimous vote reflected the council's 
concern about raising taxes without calling for a citywide vote on the matter. 
Under the special district, residents would be charged $28.50 for each 
property, said County Librarian Sandra Reuben.  
</P>
<P>
 City officials urged the council to vote no on the tax because Gardena has a 
high number of small property parcels, making the amount collected in the city 
disproportionate to the need. JON GARCIA

COMMUNITY NEWS: REDONDO BEACH; SENATE TO WEIGH BILL ON LEASE OF HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORAH SCHOCH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A financially troubled South Bay hospital could be subleased to a new operator 
without a public vote under a bill being considered by the state Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill has passed the Assembly and a Senate panel, and could be taken up by 
the full Senate today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Redondo Beach hospital is now run by a commercial hospital chain under a 
lease that is not due to expire until 2014. But under the bill, officials said, 
the public board that owns the hospital could sublease it without being 
required to get the approval of voters in the beach cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beach Cities Health District requested the change, said Dick Fruin, 
district board member. 
</P>
<P>
 "The advantage is that when you're reviewing your options with a new operator, 
you can provide confidence that presumably when you reach an agreement, it can 
be implemented promptly," Fruin said. 
</P>
<P>
 South Bay Hospital is the only hospital in the state affected by the change, 
which is part of a wide-ranging bill backed by the Assn. of California Hospital 
Districts, said Barbara Glaser, the association's legislative advocate. It was 
introduced by Sen. Ken Maddy (R-Fresno).  
</P>
<P>
 The discussion in Sacramento comes as the future of the 203-bed South Bay 
Hospital has been clouded by declining admissions and the loss of managed care 
contracts. The hospital has been run by American Medical International since 
1984 under a 30-year lease from the Beach Cities Health District. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, the district receives about $3 million a year from AMI, and it uses 
the interest to fund health-related programs in Redondo Beach, Hermosa Beach 
and Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Several local nonprofit hospitals have expressed interest in the facility, 
most recently the operators of Daniel Freeman Memorial Hospital, the nonprofit 
Catholic hospital in Inglewood. District Executive Director Robert Riley and 
Daniel Freeman officials could not be reached Wednesday for comment on the 
status of talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Glaser said that the health district requested the change because it is not 
clear whether a public vote would be required for a sublease. 
</P>
<P>
 A special election could cost a great deal, Fruin said. Besides, he said, 
"You've got the question of what is the value of a special election when the 
turnout is likely to be very small on what is a technical issue of management 
of the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 Two public hearings would still be required to sublease the hospital, 
according to district board member Tom Martin. He said that even under a 
sublease the district would still be guaranteed $3 million a year in rent.

 Seven-year-old Tommy Simpson flails his arms like a speed skater on bad ice as 
he whizzes around a portable roller hockey rink on in-line skates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Manhattan Beach resident and a dozen other pint-size players engulfed from 
head to toe in protective pads are skating around the rink in Hermosa Beach to 
learn the ropes of roller hockey, one of the South Bay's fastest-growing 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you picture yourself at the Forum after scoring a goal?" coach John 
O'Rourke, 28, bellows as his cassette player blasts Van Halen's rollicking 
"Jump." "Can you hear the roar of the crowd?" 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson can. He leaps into the air and screams victoriously as he rushes over 
the asphalt, then trips violently over his skates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it hurts," Simpson says as he sprays cool water over his face 
during a break in the class. "But football is stupid, and baseball is stupid, 
and I like this a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the nastiest spills don't check the enthusiasm of Simpson and other fans. 
 
</P>
<P>
 From blacktop parking lots in Gardena to the beachside bicycle path in 
Manhattan Beach, scores of in-line skaters clutching aluminum and wooden hockey 
sticks are knocking the sport's colorful plastic pucks everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 In Torrance, nearly 1,800 players converge every week on a $120,000 roller 
hockey rink to compete in games that sometime run until midnight. A league in 
Redondo Beach, which uses portable foam boards to construct a makeshift rink on 
school playgrounds, doubled in size in only four months. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just exploding," said Heath Mazenauer, 27, manager of the Golden Bear 
Skate Shop in Lomita, where sales of roller hockey equipment have risen almost 
40% in the last two years. The shop recently sold out of one style of in-line 
skates and is struggling to keep others in stock. Manufacturers say they can't 
keep up with orders.  
</P>
<P>
 Enthusiasts say they are drawn to the fast pace of the sport, a combination of 
ice hockey and roller skating that dates back to the 1930s, when skaters on the 
roads of New York fashioned street-worthy pucks from electrical tape. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, the number of roller hockey players has doubled each year for the 
last five years, according to Shawn Jones, executive director of the 
Miami-based National In-Line Hockey Assn. Of the country's 12 million in-line 
skaters, Jones estimates that 1 million play roller hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 Many credit ice hockey superstar Wayne Gretzky with the sport's explosive 
growth in the South Bay. Ever since Gretzky signed with the Los Angeles Kings 
in 1988, increasing numbers of fans donning replicas of his black-and-silver 
jersey have taken to area playgrounds on skates. And not all are young males. 
</P>
<P>
 At the rink in Torrance, girls practice slap shots next to boys during 
youth-league games and helmet-clad men, some of them pushing 50, bounce off the 
rink's boards chasing the puck in adult games. Even Torrance police and Carson 
sheriff's deputies have roller hockey teams.** But while the number of roller 
hockey players has surged in the South Bay in recent years, the number of rinks 
has not. Except for the rink in Torrance and another in Redondo Beach, the 
South Bay has little to offer competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding the problems for area roller hockey devotees are laws in many 
South Bay cities banning skating in city parks. City officials say skaters pose 
safety problems in parks and raise liability concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But in the last year, officials in many communities have begun to recognize 
the need for rinks, and some South Bay cities are scrambling to provide 
residents with places to play. 
</P>
<P>
 El Segundo approved plans recently for a $10,000 portable rink that is due in 
the city by the end of August. Avalon plans to construct a rink over several 
old tennis courts later this year, and Carson and Gardena are studying whether 
to purchase rinks. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, inventive enthusiasts find ways to make do. In El Segundo, 
Jean-Louis Boudreau, 34, and a few friends transformed a couple of high school 
tennis courts into a roller hockey rink by constructing foot-high borders 
around one end of the courts to keep pucks in play. 
</P>
<P>
 The boards make tennis play nearly impossible, but school officials say they 
have agreed to keep the jerry-built rink because they recognize the sport's 
popularity in the city. Tennis players head for other courts on the school 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made some tennis people real upset, but there are better courts at 
(Recreation Park)," says Boudreau, who played ice hockey on frozen baseball 
fields while growing up in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 In Manhattan Beach, where skaters are banned from city parks, die-hards 
sometimes set up goals in the middle of city streets. When cars approach, 
players grab the goals and scramble to the sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say they are considering putting a portable rink in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Until such plans come to fruition, the $120,000 roller hockey rink built last 
year at Wilson Park in Torrance has shouldered much of the burden. The 
city-owned rink is operated by the Torrance Skate Assn., a nonprofit group 
founded in 1992 that pays all insurance costs under a three-year contract with 
the city signed last year.  
</P>
<P>
 The full-size rink, complete with an electronic scoreboard, four-foot boards 
and smooth concrete, attracts enthusiasts from throughout the South Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 2-year-old skate association opened the rink in October, the number 
of league players has risen from 850 to 1,800. For the first time recently, the 
organizers were forced to turn players away. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really tough," says Craig Hama, 34, who helped organize the league with 
several others. "We need to do something very quickly so people have places to 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 Hama, who is so devoted to the sport that his wife, Lori, often refers to him 
as "Puckhead," says the organization is considering ways to build another rink 
in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, players between ages 6 and 48 pay $60 to $90 each to join teams 
organized into age groups and playing abilities. They flock to the rink on 
weeknights and weekends to play games under the watchful eye of a referee. 
</P>
<P>
 The games are much like ice hockey, in which six-player teams compete to knock 
a rubber puck into the opposing team's goal. But roller hockey has a few key 
differences. Players are not allowed to block opponents using their bodies -- 
known in ice hockey as checking -- which cuts down on fighting and violence, 
particularly in youth leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, many roller hockey leagues eliminate off-sides rules, which in 
ice hockey limit how far a puck can be passed. As a result, the game is faster 
because passes can travel the length of the rink and more goals can be scored. 
</P>
<P>
 The sounds are different too. Unlike ice hockey, where cool rinks echo with 
the slicing of sharpened blades against ice, Torrance's outdoor rink 
reverberates with the clattering and squeaking of tiny wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 Quieter moments are punctuated by shouts of "Ice it!" and "Go after the puck!" 
from encouraging friends and family members who follow the action from the 
bleachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Allen, 35, of Carson, sat quietly on a recent Sunday afternoon as 
she watched her son, Eric, 11, skate up and down the rink with his team, the 
Lightnings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really like the sport," she says. "It builds self-confidence and keeps the 
kids off the street, and I've never seen a fight break out." 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents who were concerned that violence in professional ice hockey would 
be replicated in roller hockey say they have been pleased with the way 
organizers in Torrance and Redondo have kept the rough-and-tumble to a minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really hesitant at first," says Lisi Masoni, whose 10-year-old son, 
Matthew, told her he wanted to play roller hockey last April. "But I find the 
kids don't get too aggressive, and he loves it." 
</P>
<P>
 Masoni, of Manhattan Beach, doesn't plan to take to the rink herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried Rollerblading and it hurt my back," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 But some parents have followed in the skating steps of their children. Darren 
Allison, 32, of Torrance, signed up for the city's adult league after watching 
his son, Johnnie, wheel up and down the Wilson Park rink in action-packed 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a spectator, Allison quickly moved from the bleachers to the fence abutting 
the rink. Then, when he could move no closer, he headed for a local shop and 
bought a pair of skates. He now plays on the Blues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just great," says Allison, who works at a wholesale fish brokerage in 
Los Angeles. "If you've got any aggressions to get out, this is the place to do 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Allison waited for his son's team to play on a recent weekend after his team 
was shut out 4-0 by the Chuds. "Whether you win or lose you always come off 
with a real good attitude," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Hockey coach O'Rourke started the South Bay Tides Roller Hockey Club in 
Redondo Beach in January, emphasiZing fun over competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some coaches put the emphasis in the wrong area," he says. "But this is about 
boosting self-confidence and having a good time. We make sure they shake hands 
at the end of every game." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Torrance organizers, O'Rourke has seen his league of 7- to 16-year-olds 
explode in the last six months -- from 80 players in January to 160 in April. 
He expects 300 sign-ups this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just an electrifying game," he says. "It's quick and every body's always 
in the action." 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Oglesby has been a fan of hockey's thrill-a-minute games for more than 25 
years. The El Segundo resident pushed city officials to purchase a roller 
hockey rink recently after he saw young residents playing the game on high 
school tennis courts and later learned such activity was banned in city parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a little upset," he says. "I thought we ought to do better for the 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Oglesby, 54, persuaded city officials to purchase a temporary rink to be set 
up behind El Segundo Middle School which arrived last week. He and a newly 
created roller hockey board plan to organize a league to begin play in October. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the first time Oglesby has organized competitive teams. After he saw 
children playing ice hockey on a frozen lagoon in Illinois 25 years ago, 
Oglesby organized a 20-player league that quickly grew To 70 players. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he hopes the El Segundo league will follow suit so he can one day 
persuade city officials to install a permanent rink. 
</P>
<P>
 To generate enthusiasm, he plans to invite professional players from the Los 
Angeles Kings to conduct an educational clinic for El Segundo youths. Kings' 
Coach Barry Melrose, an El Segundo resident, sits on the city's newly 
established seven-member roller hockey board which represents the El Segundo 
Roller Blade Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 But while some South Bay residents gear up to play roller hockey, others 
prefer to watch the sport at the Great Western Forum in Inglewood, where the 
Los Angeles Blades professional roller hockey team competes against 22 other 
teams from throughout the U.S. and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better than baseball," says Gary Van Zandt, 37, of Redondo Beach, one of 
5,000 fans who watched the Blades battle the Anaheim Bullfrogs recently. "I 
gave up a date to be here tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Zandt and Ron Carcich, also of Redondo Beach, have attended many of the 
Blades' games since the team began playing at the Forum last year. Struggling 
to make his voice heard over the Forum's blaring sound system, Carcich says he 
appreciates the players' enthusiasm for the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Enthusiasm is one characteristic that few South Bay roller hockey players 
lack, whether they play in front of thousands of fans at the Forum or on 
dilapidated tennis courts in El Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
 And with their skates tightened, many players are readying for the sport's 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Del Valle, one of 15 Torrance Police officers who play on the 
department's team, says he hopes the sport will soon be added to the California 
Police Olympics, an annual competition in which officers compete in sports from 
golf to surfing. 
</P>
<P>
 And Allison, the 32-year-old father who joined the Torrance league after 
watching his son play, says his family will be equipped for the action. He 
recently cut down a hockey stick for his 2-year-old daughter, Kelsey. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's already hitting the puck around the yard," he says. Finding Roller

 Residents of a community housing village in Wilmington plan to introduce 
midnight basketball and volleyball for youth who are associated with gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 The programs will be every Wednesday and Friday from 9 p.m. to midnight, 
starting next month, said Donna Capelouto, program coordinator with the Dana 
Strand Resident Advisory Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be for high-risk kids (who) either want to be gang members, are gang 
members or are ex-gang members," Capelouto said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to set up to have someone there to counsel the kids, if they 
want, and give referrals. We want to make it more than just an athletic event." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department, the city and various community groups are 
supporting the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Capelouto said she expects about 12 teams will be formed for 120 youths -- 
males 16 to 24 and females 14 to 20. SUSAN WOODWARD

BRIEFLY; LIBRARIES: CRACKDOWN ON TARDY PATRONS 
</P>

 The Palos Verdes Library District, which is owed $200,000 in overdue fines and 
missing materials, plans to hire a collection agency to track down delinquent 
patrons, spokeswoman Nancy Mahr says. 
</P>
<P>
 Library trustees approved the measure unanimously earlier this month.Mahr said 
many of the 14,000 notices sent out last November and targeting delinquenT 
borrowers were returned to the district, indicating that the addresses were 
incorrect or unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 The three Palos Verdes Peninsula libraries have issued 57,000 library cards to 
patrons, Mahr said. Of these, 1,050 owe more than $10. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, library users with overdue materials received two notices, and if 
there was no response, the library gave up the chase, Mahr said. Now, a third 
notice will inform patrons with fines of more than $10 that their accounts will 
be turned over to a collection agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The district has not determined how much a collection agency would cost. Many 
agencies work on commission, and some may also require a fee, Mahr said.  
</P>
<P>
 The library will distribute bookmarks and post signs urging people to return 
their materials on time. In addition, patrons will be required to renew their 
library cards every year, rather than every two years, and library cards will 
be deactivated if fines exceed $5. JEFF KASS

BRIEFLY; LANDMARKS: $50,000 FOR BRIDGE-LIGHTING PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The fight to string lights on the Vincent Thomas Bridge, which spans the main 
channel of the Port of Los Angeles, got a $50,000 boost recently from the Los 
Angeles City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of Harbor area residents has fought since the bridge's 25th 
anniversary in 1988 to illuminate Southern California's longest suspension 
bridge, a 6,060-foot link between San Pedro and Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 They argue that the bridge, which fades from view at night, could be a perfect 
welcoming monument to Los Angeles for visitors arriving by air or sea.  
</P>
<P>
 "Just like the Golden Gate (Bridge) is the welcoming sign to San Francisco, 
the Vincent Thomas Bridge will be the welcoming sign to L.A.," said Louis 
Dominguez, the committee's chair. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee can at last move ahead with a design to light the bridge's span, 
cables and roadways, Dominguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we go just about anywhere in the world, the major bridges are considered 
to be a part of the skyline of the city," he said. "This is the only bridge we 
can find that isn't lit." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the port communities have donated $20,000 toward the expense, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost is expected to be about $300,000, so the committee continues to lobby 
city officials for $144,000 set aside for a harbor monument. The money was 
donated to the city by a Japanese firm, Shuwa Corp., several years ago, 
Dominguez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Kruesopon, a spokesman for Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr., who represents 
the Harbor area, said he believes the city will contribute more funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then (the bridge) will be seen way out from the ocean as well as from here in 
City Hall on a clear day," Kruesopon said. SUSAN WOODWARD

PEOPLE: TORRANCE TEACHER FOSTERS LOVE FOR LITTLE CREATURES WITH $10,000 GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN PATERNO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not too many people react to stink bugs the way Judy Goldsmith does. "I get 
really excited about them," said Goldsmith, a science teacher at Torrance's 
Madrona Middle School. "They make the cutest, littlest footprints."  
</P>
<P>
 Goldsmith's love of the natural world is largely why she was one of 40 
teachers chosen nationwide to receive a $10,000 grant, which she plans to use 
to help restore Torrance's Madrona Marsh, a 42-acre expanse of cracked, sandy 
soil surrounding oil derricks, bordered by Del Amo Fashion Center and usually 
filled with trash and weeds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Madrona is a vernal marsh," Goldsmith explained. "It's supposed to dry up 
part of the year."  
</P>
<P>
 The trash, weeds and oil derricks are not what nature intended, she conceded. 
Though not much can be done about the derricks, Goldsmith said, she and her 
students will help a group of community activists restore the marsh to its 
pre-Columbian glory days, replacing trash and weeds with indigenous plants, 
bugs, birds, reptiles and animals.  
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I look at it all, all the 40 acres, and I think, how in the world 
are we going to get rid of all the weeds? We can't. But if we keep enough 
people involved," she said, "well, maybe we can."  
</P>
<P>
 Before Spanish settlers arrived in Southern California, Native Americans used 
to paddle in dugout canoes through the marsh's tall grass up a thin, shallow 
lake that extended from San Pedro to El Segundo. In the marsh's modern period, 
settlers were followed by bulldozers, housing tracts and shopping malls. In the 
early 1970s, a massive residential and commercial project threatened to kill 
the wetland, but the Friends of the Madrona Marsh sprung to its defense. In 
1983, the marsh was declared a nature preserve.  
</P>
<P>
 Goldsmith's grant -- sponsored by Toyota and the National Science Teachers 
Assn. -- will buy a high-powered computer so she and her students can create a 
field guide to the marsh. They'll also continue replacing weeds with seedlings 
grown in class. Eventually, they hope to introduce indigenous bugs, birds and 
animals.  
</P>
<P>
 Goldsmith, a Lomita resident, has been teaching on and off in Torrance for 30 
years and has lived in the South Bay her whole life. She wanted to try to 
restore the marsh -- which is only a few blocks from Madrona school -- for a 
couple of reasons, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm into trying to save things that we have. The marsh is the last piece of 
wilderness left in Torrance that there is to save. It's close to school and 
it's something the students of Torrance should know about and do their share 
about keeping," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Wendi Sweet, 12, agreed. Before taking Goldsmith's science class last year, 
she never thought about the marsh, she said. Now, when she visits it, Wendi 
imagines "what Torrance was like before all the buildings and stuff, when there 
were plants and animals all around." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Goldsmith attributes her interest in science to her own experiences as a child 
growing up in Inglewood on a street that backed up to a huge field. That field, 
now a car lot, was big enough for Goldsmith to roam for hours, hiding in the 
tall grass, where she plotted dirt-clod fighting strategies.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in first grade, I had a girlfriend whose mother was into reptiles. 
She showed me a big, black indigo snake and it wrapped around my waist. She had 
an alligator, and we went grunion hunting to feed the alligator. We baby-sat 
their skunk when they went on vacation." 
</P>
<P>
 Her parents supported her goal to become a science teacher. "It doesn't matter 
what you're going to be, as long as you're the best you can be at whatever you 
do. That's what my parents told me, and that's what I tell the kids in school.  
</P>
<P>
 "My biggest goal is to get kids excited about science. I don't always achieve 
that and that gets me down. But if I can get a spark going, then it'll come 
through. Last year I had a doctor come to me and tell me I had inspired her to 
become a doctor. That made me feel wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldsmith hopes the Madrona Marsh project will keep the spark of learning 
alive for her students. "As long as I'm at Madrona," she said, "we'll be taking 
care of the marsh."

 At first glance, the Highrose Cafe looks like just another burger/submarine 
place near the beach. Look past the burgers, though, and you'll find Near 
Eastern dishes, and a smattering of Greek, Cajun, Japanese and Mexican items as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mediterranean pedigree stems from a Jordanian mountain village named Salt, 
where the Dahdah family lived before moving to Beirut, Lebanon. The family came 
to America in 1971, and Steve David Dahdah opened the Highrose in Manhattan 
Beach two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Large windows provide a view of the ocean a block away, as well as a look at 
the sea of humanity walking past the busy corner. With built-in decor like 
this, the restaurant confines its interior ornamentation to a few 
black-and-white photos of Manhattan Beach dating back to 1912.  
</P>
<P>
 The Dahdah family recipes date back quite a bit, and a good way to sample them 
is to order a combination plate. The No. 5 ($6.50), for example, consists of 
rice-stuffed grape leaves, falafel (a "croquette" of ground garbanzos), hummus 
(a dip made of ground garbanzos flavored with sesame seed paste, lemon juice 
and garlic) and tabbouleh (a salad of bulgur wheat, parsley, mint, chopped 
tomatos and onions tossed with olive oil and lemon juice). This dish, with its 
accompanying basket of pita bread, is large enough for a nice small lunch or 
serious snack for two. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As in all beach communities, salads are a big draw here. Greek, chicken and 
Caesar salads are available, either alone or in combination (small, $3.95; 
large, $6.25).  
</P>
<P>
 For a main course there is souvlaki ($6.50), a Greek-style lamb shish kebab 
served with rice and salad. You can also find Japanese teriyaki chicken and 
Mexican fajitas . The Cajun notes are provided by a blackened, spicy Hawaiian 
tuna ($6.50) and a blackened chicken breast ($6.25). 
</P>
<P>
 Highrose Cafe is at 306 Rosecrans Ave., Manhattan Beach. (310) 545-6571. Open 
Sunday through Thursday 11 a.m. to 10 p.m., Friday and Saturday 11 a.m. to 2 
a.m. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

VOLUNTEERS WILL TURN ON YE OLDE CHARM AT FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By JOHN POPE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Natalie Beatie of Gardena works as a salesclerk at a Los Angeles industrial 
supply company, but this weekend she will don the trappings of 16th-Century 
England and help transform Long Beach's Shoreline Park into an Olde English 
village. 
</P>
<P>
 The Renaissance festival is arriving, and for two days, Beatie and other 
volunteers will have the chance to become any character they choose -- peasant, 
noble, gypsy, craftsman, minstrel and others. Beatie, a five-year festival 
veteran, plays a brewer's wife in a group of traveling merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach Renaissance Arts Festival, celebrating its 10th anniversary 
this year, seeks to re-create a spring celebration during the reign of Queen 
Elizabeth I, complete with royal feasts, mock battles, parades, folk pageants, 
traditional games and fortunetellers. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighty booths, surrounding the Rainbow Lagoon at Shoreline Park, will have 
food and drink to satisfy the hungriest knight. And dozens of vendors will sell 
everything from swords and daggers to jewelry and handmade garlands. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival is a fund-raiser for the Traveler's Aid Society, a United Way 
agency that assists the homeless. The event, which attracted about 12,000 
people last year, raises an average of $23,000 for the homeless each year. 
</P>
<P>
 It relies on about 600 volunteer performers to add an authentic flavor and 
interact with customers. Although some pageants are scripted, most of the 
actors improvise at the Long Beach festival. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Royal Court" is also made up of volunteer actors. This year's "royalty" 
will include King James, who ruled Scotland during Elizabeth's reign and 
assumed her throne when she died without an heir in 1603; his Queen, Ann of 
Denmark; the Irish Queen and her entourage, and the King of Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
 Performers pride themselves on making sure costumes are authentic and that 
accessories, from drinking cups to metalwork, could be created from the 
technology and tools of the Elizabethan era. They often chide festival-goers 
for wearing "strange bejeweled blindfolds" (sunglasses, of course), and 
athletic shoes that show the person is no doubt dealing with "a shady pirate 
who doth sail from the Far East." 
</P>
<P>
 Many performers spend summer weekends at festivals across the state, including 
San Marcos, San Bernardino, Long Beach and San Luis Obispo. Some festival 
organizers pay performers, but the sums usually don't exceed lunch money. 
</P>
<P>
 Transforming into a different character, with name, background and attitude 
developed by the performer, is a unique creative outlet, Beatie said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Creating a character allows you the freedom to do things that you wouldn't 
ordinarily do," she said. "It's a real release for me, a break from the humdrum 
of everyday life." 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach Renaissance Arts Festival is on Saturday and Sunday from 10 
a.m. to 6 p.m. at the Rainbow Lagoon, near Pine Avenue and Shoreline Drive. 
Admission is $8 for adults, $5 for seniors, $2 for children 5 through 12. 
Children under 5 are free. Information: (310) 437-0751.

NOTEBOOK / ROB FERNAS; EL CAMINO IS PULLING OUT ALL THE STOPS IN EFFORT TO 
IMPROVE DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After watching his team give up an average of 32 points a game last season, El 
Camino College football Coach John Featherstone knew something had to be done 
about the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt it was time to make a change," Featherstone said. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Warriors junked their old system in favor of the defensive scheme run 
by the University of Arizona. Featherstone and three of his assistants spent 
two days in Tucson last spring learning the double-eagle flex defense from 
Wildcat Coach Dick Tomey and his staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona boasted one of the nation's best defenses in 1993, and Featherstone 
believes the system can work for El Camino, which is coming off a 2-8 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a long ways to go to perfect it, but I think we have the guys to run 
it," Featherstone said. "It's a more conservative defense than we ran last 
year. You can blitz out of it, but still be safe in (pass) coverage." 
</P>
<P>
 Featherstone said opponents began exploiting El Camino in its old system, the 
aggressive split-six, in which the Warriors blitzed on almost every down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got beat on man coverage too much," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Featherstone hopes the combination of a new system, six returning starters and 
the addition of several promising newcomers will make for a much-improved 
Warrior defense. El Camino opens the season Sept. 10 at home against Rancho 
Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One defensive player who figures to get significant playing time for El Camino 
is former Hawthorne High standout Ronnie Morrissette, a transfer from Fresno 
State. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrissette, an outside linebacker, started a few games as a freshman last 
season for Fresno State but reportedly didn't get along with Coach Jim Sweeney. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, Featherstone is glad to have the versatile Morrissette, who 
played several positions (tight end, quarterback, linebacker and safety) in 
helping Hawthorne win the Southern Section Division III title in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Cain, former coach at Banning High and an assistant the past four seasons 
at Cal State Dominguez Hills, was named men's basketball coach at Harbor 
College on Wednesday. Cain, 43, replaces Carl Strong, who resigned earlier this 
month after coaching Harbor for three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 South Bay girls participated on four doubles teams that won titles last week 
at the National Amateur Athletic Union Junior Olympic beach volleyball 
tournament at Cabrillo Beach in San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 Joi Thomas of Bishop Montgomery High and Malaika Naulls, the daughter of 
former San Pedro High, UCLA and NBA basketball player Willie Naulls, won the 
12th-grade-and-under title. Naulls attends Harvard-Westlake in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 Other local winners were sisters Shawni and Rani Lopez of San Pedro in the 
10th-grade-and-under division, Chrissie Zartman of Hermosa Beach and Tracy 
Lindquist of Fountain Valley in eighth-grade-and-under, and Jenny Peterson of 
Manhattan Beach and Kim Loeffler of Hermosa Beach in sixth-grade-and-under. 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Brothers James and Pa'a Pepe, former defensive standouts at Carson High, will 
play football this season for College of the Redwoods in Eureka, Calif. James 
Pepe, a linebacker, was The Times' South Bay lineman of the year in 1992. He 
signed with Oregon out of high school but sat out last season after he failed 
to qualify academically. Pa'a Pepe, a defensive back, helped Carson win the 
City Section 4-A Division title last season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Loyola Marymount women's volleyball team, ranked 23rd in the nation, will 
play an alumni team at 6:30 p.m. Saturday at Gersten Pavilion.

DOCTORS SAY FONUA MUST SKIP SPORTS IN SENIOR YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROB FERNAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To some, he was the Terminator in cleats. 
</P>
<P>
 But he won't be back. At least not this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Mira Costa High's football team begins full-contact practice today without 
three-sport standout Phil Fonua, regarded as one of the top prep defensive 
linemen in the country. Doctors said Fonua will be unable to participate in 
athletics in his senior year after undergoing surgery Aug. 11 for a ruptured 
blood vessel in his brain. 
</P>
<P>
 Fonua was transferred Tuesday from Torrance Memorial Medical Center to the 
Daniel Freeman Center for Diagnostic and Rehabilitation Medicine in Inglewood, 
where he will undergo an intensive program of physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Melvin Snyder, the neurosurgeon who performed the delicate, four-hour 
operation on Fonua, said the prep All-American has experienced some weakness on 
his right side and probably will need two to four weeks of rehabilitation 
before he regains normal strength and motor skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really expect a full recovery," Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. James Joachim, Fonua's physician, was equally optimistic regarding his 
patient's condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Phil has done remarkably well," Joachim said. "He has responded beautifully 
to the after-effects of his neurosurgery. He's a very strong, resilient young 
man." 
</P>
<P>
 While the prognosis is good, it remains to be seen whether Fonua will be able 
to return to competitive athletics. His brain aneurysm was caused by a 
condition he was born with -- a weakening in the wall of the blood vessel that 
caused it to bulge, leak and eventually rupture. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-2, 275-pound Fonua suffered a seizure and collapsed Aug. 10 during 
a workout in the Mira Costa weight room. Joachim credits Manhattan Beach 
paramedics, the first called to the scene, for preventing a tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The paramedics truly saved this young man's life," Joachim said. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, Joachim said it is too early to comment on the feasibility or 
practicality of Fonua ever playing football again. Fonua will also have to skip 
the basketball and track seasons during the 1994-95 school year, doctors said. 
He competed in all three sports as a junior at Mira Costa. 
</P>
<P>
 This year "is completely out of the question," Joachim said. "I don't think 
any physician would clear Phil for any contact or non-contact sport. He and his 
family realize life is more important than the risk of the recurrence of a 
serious head injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I know there is a very courageous spiritual side to this young man that 
may change what happens in the future. (But) at this moment, I would not ever 
allow him to participate in any contact or non-contact sport, for at least a 
year," Joachim said. "His family knows this is well-advised medical advice." 
</P>
<P>
 Joachim said athletics did not play a part in Fonua's seizure, but Snyder, a 
specialist who has practiced neurosurgery for 17 years, said Fonua's "very 
active physical activities" could have contributed to the blood vessel 
rupturing at an earlier age. Fonua, 17, had kept up a busy schedule even in the 
summer, participating in off-season football and basketball games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unusual to see (a ruptured aneurysm) in someone his age," Snyder said. 
"When it reaches the point when it ruptures, normally the person is in the 
fourth or fifth decade of life." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. John Neal, a neurosurgeon at UC Irvine Medical Center in Orange, said he 
has never heard of a young athlete with a ruptured aneurysm in 10 years of 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not something that has been studied extensively because it's highly 
unusual," Neal said. "It's hard to know exactly what the outcome will be. If 
the aneurysm has been taken care of and there are no other aneurysms, then the 
prospect for a normal life expectancy would be excellent. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chances of him having further problems are quite small," Neal said, "but 
there is a possibility of him developing another aneurysm over the course of 
his life. These things usually develop over a long period." 
</P>
<P>
 Snyder said Fonua's surgery was a success. In describing the procedure, he 
said a specialized surgical clip was placed at the base of the aneurysm that 
prevents blood flow to the damaged area but allows blood to all the normal 
vessels. 
</P>
<P>
 But will the operation and a proper recovery be enough to allow Fonua to 
resume his football career? 
</P>
<P>
 "We have left it with the family," Snyder said. "Sports and activities are 
certainly out for the next year. After that, (his condition) has to be 
re-evaluated. . . . The consequences of playing football have to be seriously 
considered." 
</P>
<P>
 Recruiters have not given up hope that Fonua can play college football. USC, 
Fonua's top choice, reportedly will honor a previous scholarship offer despite 
the uncertainty surrounding the player's future. 
</P>
<P>
 This doesn't surprise Allen Wallace, editor and publisher of SuperPrep 
magazine, whose recruiting publication ranked Fonua the 13th-best defensive 
line prospect in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's such a good prospect," Wallace said. "I think numerous schools will save 
a place for him. From my knowledge, he could possibly recover and play. There's 
no question in my mind that some schools have told him (since the surgery) they 
have a scholarship for him if he likes." 
</P>
<P>
 After USC, Fonua had listed Notre Dame, Arizona, Washington and Florida State 
as his top choices. Of course, that was before his surgery. Wallace, though, 
doesn't believe many recruiters will be scared off. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in a position where if he didn't play as a senior, it wouldn't make 
any difference," Wallace said. "His recruitability is still high." 
</P>
<P>
 Fonua, surprisingly agile for his size, emerged as one of the South Bay's best 
all-around prep athletes during the 1993-94 school year. He helped Mira Costa 
win the Southern Section Division VII football title, its first in the sport, 
with his play at fullback and nose guard; he was starting center on the Ocean 
League champion basketball team and he placed fourth in the shotput at the 
state track meet. He is powerful, quick and can dunk a basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 Mira Costa football Coach Don Morrow said the loss of Fonua will be felt by 
the team on and off the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'll be OK on offense, but defensively he's so disruptive," Morrow 
said. "I don't know who can replace him at nose guard. The other bad part of it 
is that the kids really like him. He plays with a real fun style." 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow said he hopes Fonua can contribute to the team in some capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll help out in some sort of role, I would suspect," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors credit much of Fonua's rapid recovery to the support of family and 
friends, many of whom have visited him in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Fonua's mother, Vila, has maintained an around-the-clock vigil at her son's 
bedside since he was hospitalized, going home only to shower. She hasn't given 
up hope that her son can attend classes Sept. 12, the first day of school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he will make it," she said. "It's just like a miracle what has 
happened to my son. We thank God for his life."

CEMETERY: METHODS OF LOCATING HISTORIC SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your article incorrectly attributes to me comments regarding the use of radar 
for detecting underground objects ("Cemetery Dispute Mars Housing Plan," Aug. 
11). First, I did not discuss the use of radar with your writer, Susan 
Woodward. However, I did discuss the use of magnetometer testing and indicated 
that this technique would not be effective on the project area. Let me explain. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsurface artifacts and features affect the local magnetic field. 
Archeologists use a magnetometer to detect these field differences to pinpoint 
the location of artifacts and features. Where field anomalies are detected, one 
can excavate to discover the artifacts and features. 
</P>
<P>
 This technique is ineffective in an area where artifacts and features coexist 
with other material that also affects the local magnetic field. The 
magnetometer cannot tell the difference between a soldier's belt buckle and a 
modern railroad spike. It will detect them both. If there are hundreds of 
spikes and only one buckle, hundreds of locations would need to be probed. 
</P>
<P>
 At the project location, the area is contaminated with construction materials, 
has a railroad line running through it and is proximate to electrical power 
lines. All of this would contribute to multiple false readings on a 
magnetometer. These false readings would mask the presence of a small cemetery 
and related artifacts. In short, the use of a magnetometer would not solve this 
"needle in a haystack" problem. 
</P>
<P>
 On another issue, the "map" which is shown in the photo is not the 1872 map to 
which your writer refers. What is being displayed is based upon a re-creation 
of the Drum Barracks compound by a museum volunteer. The re-creation was itself 
based partly upon an 1872 drawing of the compound prepared by Lt. David Craigie 
as part of an inventory of buildings and materials to be sold at public 
auction. The Craigie rendering of the compound contained several scaling errors 
which seriously undermine its usefulness for determining the cemetery location 
within the bounds of Drum Barracks. However, the museum volunteer did not take 
the scaling errors into account and plotted the cemetery in a location which 
cannot be justified. 
</P>
<P>
 The Drum Barracks Museum continues to reproduce pamphlets which show this 
erroneous plotting of the cemetery. In point of fact, there is nowhere in the 
records, National Archives or other, a precise location of the cemetery. The 
Drum Barracks Museum personnel admit this fact (in print, this article) and yet 
continue to disregard the findings of both our archival and field work. 
</P>
<P>
 As archeologists, we are disappointed not to have found the historic cemetery, 
especially one of such significance in its association with the Drum Barracks. 
Such a historic feature is capable of providing invaluable data as to the 
health status, cause of death, method of burial, etc., of the affected 
individuals. Identification of the remains and their removal to a military or 
other protected cemetery would also have been possible. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, finding the cemetery would have been both interesting and 
worthwhile. However, focusing on an erroneous location is not productive. 
Future attention might be better directed toward the preservation and 
protection of those portions of the Drum Barracks compound that have not been 
developed.

HOUSING: AIR FORCE PLAN FOR SAN PEDRO SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This letter is in regards to an Air Force proposal to build up to 150 new 
military family homes on the former Upper Reservation of Fort MacArthur instead 
of at the closed Navy housing at Taper Avenue, both in San Pedro. The Air Force 
has rejected the old Navy housing and claims it would cost more to build new 
homes on the Taper Avenue property than on the Upper Reservation of Fort 
MacArthur where there are currently no homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Why must the Air Force brass lie and rip off the American public? Why can't 
they be honest and admit they want brand-new "million-dollar" ocean view homes 
for their officers? Anyone with an IQ above a rodent knows it's cheaper to 
build homes where there already are streets, gutters, sidewalks, storm drains, 
and sewer, water, natural gas, electricity and cable TV hook-ups like at the 
Taper Avenue site.  
</P>
<P>
 It is a bold-faced lie to suggest that it's less costly to put in new homes 
where these services are currently unavailable like at Fort MacArthur. The old 
Navy housing could be razed and beautiful housing could be built there for the 
Air Force for less public money and in less time! 
</P>
<P>
 Once again our government officials have manipulated their cost figures for 
their own designs and plan to take from the public! If you agree with me, 
please write to your elected officials so we may stop this travesty.

NUDISM: POTENTIAL CLOSURE OF SACRED BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The article "Nude Beach Unveils Political Dispute" (July 14) is a bit too 
reminiscent of the old story about the woman who calls the police to report a 
naked man in the house across the street. When they arrive, they can see 
nothing; she leads them upstairs to her bedroom and insists they look out the 
window.They point out that even from this vantage point, the man can only be 
seen from the waist up. "Stand on the bed! Stand on the bed!" she cries. 
</P>
<P>
 As one who has enjoyed the tranquil beauty of Sacred Beach for many years, I 
can honestly say that I have never personally witnessed any offensive behavior 
there, unless you count the occasional (clothed) fisherman littering the point 
with fast-food containers, which are usually picked up later by the 
beach-goers. It is possible, however, that my vision is not so keen as that of 
the complainant, who seems to be willing to walk a mile from the nearest 
parking, and then climb down a steep and treacherous cliff, expressly for the 
purpose of being offended. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe the key to this whole non-issue lies in the line "the council has 
the political will to close the beach since conservatives Marilyn Lyon and Lee 
Byrd were elected in November." It is so sad to think of this quiet, beautiful 
spot being taken away from everyone, just to further the joyless agenda of a 
few who don't even use the beach, but cannot bear to live with the haunting 
fear that someone, somewhere, is happy.

ELECTION: STANCE OF LIBERTARIAN CANDIDATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is with reference to published reports and newspaper articles concerning 
the indictments of Rep. Walter R. Tucker III (D-Compton) on charges of bribery 
and income tax evasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Can we feel the breath of fresh air coming in the open window? 
</P>
<P>
 I am referring to the fact that there is one opposition candidate to Tucker: 
Guy Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is a Libertarian. That statement should tell the readers plenty about 
him: Libertarians believe that government at all levels is too large, too 
expensive, woefully inefficient, arrogant, intrusive and downright dangerous in 
some respects. Democratic and Republican politicians have created this 
situation and do not intend to change it. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson does not accept political action committee money or other funds 
intended to influence him. Newspaper articles are quick to report that Guy 
Wilson has raised zero dollars for his campaign. Libertarians have no special 
interest funds; Libertarians recognize individual responsibilities that we all 
share to preserve our American heritage of liberty, personal responsibility and 
freedom in accordance with our Bill of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is an honest, sincere working man (seaman) who has integrity. As a 
working man, he understands the needs and concerns of his constituency. As a 
Libertarian, he believes that government is best which governs least. As an 
African American, he is well aware of the problems faced by his community and 
will be active in developing solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 So, instead of decrying the situation in the 37th Congressional District, 
where the citizens have no choice but to reelect a potential problem with a 
really bad record, rather rejoice that the voters do not have to despair. They 
can send a strong message to Congress and they can vote for an honest 
candidate, sensitive to their concerns -- Guy Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 These fortunate citizens of the 37th Congressional District have the great 
opportunity to vote for Guy Wilson for Congress. Try it folks, you'll love it.

RELIGION: STORY ON MORMON CHURCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, it was 
refreshing to read Thursday's South Bay cover story, "Mission of Diversity." I 
found the article to be not only accurate, but representative of a general 
feeling of church members that Christlike living and standards are not bound by 
racial and cultural barriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Seventeen years ago, my husband and I traveled to Brazil to adopt twin boys 
who were dying in a makeshift orphanage. Upon their arrival in the States, 
after extensive medical and psychological testing, our boys were diagnosed with 
Maternal Deprivation Syndrome and were not expected to live past age 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, our two sons are full-time Mormon missionaries, sharing the message 
that God is alive and has a plan of happiness for all of His children on Earth. 
Our boys were raised in a loving home that often took in those who were in 
need. Over the years we have had members of the church from Nicaragua, Mexico, 
El Salvador, Japan, Tahiti and Haiti live in our home. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mormon Church has always encouraged diversity in its mem bership, seeking 
out those with desires to live as Christ taught, regardless of race. Thank you 
for your thoughtful and well-educated story of our faith. 
</P>

 It was refreshing to read last Thursday's (Aug. 18) article about the Mormons 
in the South Bay section. The reporters certainly did their homework well. The 
article was thoroughly researched, informative and upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 It was excellent except for one quote from Father Coiro. His remark tended to 
distort a basic teaching of Mormonism concerning our ultimate potential. My 
faith teaches me to strive to be the best I can be. We accept literally the 
injunction of the Savior, Jesus Christ, to strive to become "perfect, even as 
your Father which is in heaven is perfect" (Matthew 5:48). I am sorry that 
Father Coiro feels that his doctrine should be offensive to Catholics. 
</P>
<P>
 We need greater understanding of the diverse religious traditions in our 
communities and less distortion and sensationalizing. This article took a great 
step in that direction. Thank you very much.

 DUMP DEE DEE? -- A shake-up may be coming shortly in the White House 
communications shop. President Clinton's new chief of staff, former California 
congressman Leon E. Panetta, is planning a number of White House personnel 
changes to take effect around Labor Day. Among the rumored shifts are the 
replacement of Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers and the transfer of Communications 
Director Mark D. Gearan back to the chief of staff's office, where he served at 
the beginning of the Clinton Administration. Panetta has been quietly sounding 
out a number of Washington media types about top communications jobs. Many 
believe that his longtime spokesman, Barry Toiv, could be moving to the White 
House. Well-regarded State Department spokesman Michael McCurry is also 
frequently mentioned as a possible new White House press secretary. Myers is 
generally liked by White House reporters but is thought to lack the 
authoritative voice expected from the chief mouthpiece for the U.S. government. 
Top White House aides, including presidential intimate George Stephanopoulos, 
are said to be fighting to keep Myers in her position.

 DISNEY BLUES -- Virginians and the Walt Disney Co. are at odds once again over 
the fuzzy line between fact and entertainment. As debate over the historical 
authenticity of Disney's proposed theme park, "America," rages outside 
Washington, the entertainment giant finds itself facing similar complaints from 
Virginians about a film it is helping finance titled "Jefferson in Paris." The 
loyal opposition, led by Virginia developer Baghman Batmanghelidj, complain 
that the movie embraces the scurrilous and often repeated claims that Thomas 
Jefferson had a slave mistress, Sally Hemings. Batmanghelidj has enlisted the 
support of eminent historians and others who discredit the claims, noting that 
they have never been supported by more than hearsay. The developer has grown so 
agitated that he has reversed his earlier support for the "America" project, 
which he claims would benefit him financially by leading an economic boom in 
the region. Asked by the Washington Post about the controversy, "Jefferson in 
Paris" producer Ismail Merchant and director James Ivory issued a 
single-sentence response: "The whole Thomas Jefferson-Sally Hemings liaison, if 
there was one, is, after nearly 200 years, a romantic legend, just as his love 
affair with Maria Cosway is, though the latter is more substantiated."

 EMPTY SHOES -- With the Brady law's waiting period for handgun purchases 
already on the books and with the assault weapons ban tantalizingly close to 
adoption, there is no sign of a letup by anti-gun forces. On Sept. 20, a 
"silent march" to protest gun violence is planned to the steps of the Capitol. 
An estimated 38,000 pairs of shoes will be laid out on the steps, one for every 
person killed by guns annually in the United States -- based on 1991 data. 
There will be more shoes for California than any other state, because it leads 
in the number of gun homicides -- 2,949 -- and suicides -- 1,956. But its 159 
accidental or undetermined gun deaths run second to Texas, which had 195. The 
march coordinators, who are unpaid volunteers working out of their homes, say 
they are not endorsing legislation but are just trying to build grass-roots 
support for combatting what they contend is an epidemic of handgun violence.

HIGH SCHOOL SAT RESULTS A MIXED BAG FOR COUNTY; EDUCATION: COLLEGE-BOUND 
SENIORS SHOW FAR BETTER MATH SKILLS THAN VERBAL. SOME CAMPUSES SHOWED LARGE 
DECLINES IN BOTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Ventura County high schools showed mixed results on the latest Scholastic 
Aptitude Tests, with Simi Valley and Camarillo high schools scoring the most 
substantial gains and Ventura High posting an alarming drop. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirroring state and national trends, college-bound seniors who took the SAT at 
county high schools last spring performed far better in the math portion than 
the verbal. 
</P>
<P>
 Some schools showed substantial declines in both areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura High School's scores plunged 42 points in verbal skills, from 440 to 
398, and 33 points in math, from 492 to 459. 
</P>
<P>
 The sharp drops, the biggest posted by any county school, took Ventura High 
from being above the state average to below in both the math and verbal 
sections. The California average was 482 in math and 413 in verbal skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Unified School District officials said Wednesday they are unable to 
explain the performance of the 398 Ventura High seniors who took the test last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 But they plan to beef up their college-prep curriculum or take any other steps 
necessary to help students earn the high SAT scores crucial for admission to 
many of the nation's best colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are taking a serious look at what's happening at the school," said Arlene 
Miro, the district's director of administrative services. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically, only the brightest and most ambitious students take the SAT, which 
are designed solely as a tool for college-admissions directors. Although the 
number of students who took the tests in Ventura County's schools was 
unavailable Wednesday, state education officials reported that 46% of 
California seniors sat through the rigorous 2 1/2-hour exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Graded on a scale of 200 to 800 points, the SAT's verbal portion measures 
knowledge of vocabulary and reading comprehension. The math section contains 
problems in arithmetic, algebra and geometry. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, Thousand Oaks High had an average math score of 551 -- the 
best in the county and nearly 70 points above the state average of 482. 
</P>
<P>
 As was true around the state and the nation, Thousand Oaks boys scored better 
in math than girls. Boys at the school averaged 575 in math contrasted with 507 
for male students statewide, while Thousand Oaks High girls scored an average 
of 526 contrasted with the California average of 461. 
</P>
<P>
 Conejo Valley Unified School District officials attributed the school's good 
math results to demanding teachers, well-educated parents and toughened 
graduation requirements that force students to take a heavier load of academic 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo High School students achieved the highest average verbal score in 
the county, 486, 73 points higher than the state average. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the importance of SAT scores for students' college admission and 
for a school's public image, Principal Terry Tackett said Camarillo High took 
steps last school year to improve seniors' performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Camarillo High encouraged its seniors to take SAT-preparation courses offered 
by private companies after school hours. 
</P>
<P>
 And during school hours, English teachers came up with one vocabulary word per 
day that teachers in all subjects were expected to integrate into their 
instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "All year they have stressed vocabulary and reading," Tackett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley High's average verbal score improved by 15 points, from 434 to 
449, and its results in math went up slightly from 520 to 524. 
</P>
<P>
 But far fewer Simi Valley High students took the test this year than last -- 
167 versus 204 -- which school officials blame on the Jan. 17 earthquake that 
caused severe damage around the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the College Board, which publishes the SAT, maintain that the 
smaller the percentage of students that take the test at a particular school 
the better the average scores, because in general the highest-achievers sit for 
the exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Simi Valley High students took the SAT in the months after the quake, 
which damaged their school so badly they had to move their classes across town 
to Royal High. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to remember, in Simi we were dramatically affected by the 
earthquake," said Rebecca Wetzel, Simi Valley Unified School District program 
director. 
</P>
<P>
 In Fillmore, the other Ventura County city severely affected by the quake, the 
high school was not substantially damaged and SAT scores declined slightly from 
the previous year. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the small percentage of a school's enrollment that takes the exam, 
Santa Paula Union High School Principal Sandra Barbier said she is concerned 
about the public judging the success of a school on the basis of 
college-entrance exams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really hate to see the measure of a school based on an SAT score," Barbier 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Paula Union High's verbal score of 415 was about even with the state 
average, while its math score of 454 is nearly 30 points below the California 
average. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such concerns as Barbier's, college admissions officials said they 
give the exams high priority when deciding whom to admit to their schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Grading standards and curricula differ from school to school, said Ernie 
Sandlin, director of admission at Cal Lutheran University in Thousand Oaks. But 
SATs are the same across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 They are our "one standard piece of information," Sandlin said. "They're 
extremely important." At Cal Lutheran, the average SAT score for this year's 
incoming freshmen is 450 verbal and 480 math, he said. Average SAT Scores in

JUDGE STORCH ASSIGNED TO CIVIL BENCH; COURTS: BRADBURY HAD BLOCKED HIM FROM 
HEARING CRIMINAL CASES. RESHUFFLING IS CHARACTERIZED AS MOST EFFICIENT USE OF 
RESOURCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Superior Court judge whom Dist. Atty. Michael D. Bradbury blocked from 
hearing criminal cases four months ago has been reassigned to civil duties in a 
shuffling of judicial posts announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning Tuesday, Judge Lawrence Storch will oversee the progress of civil 
suits and preside over settlement conferences. Storch will replace Superior 
Court Judge Richard D. Aldrich, who last week was appointed to the state 
appellate court and is expected to be sworn in Monday following a confirmation 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Presiding Judge Melinda A. Johnson said Storch's transfer had 
nothing to do with Bradbury's decision in April to effectively ban Storch from 
hearing criminal matters. The district attorney ordered his prosecutors to sign 
sworn statements that Storch is biased weeks after the judge reduced a verdict 
from first- to second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not being done because we need to put Larry Storch somewhere," she 
said. "Larry Storch is a terrific, fabulous civil case settler. He's the best 
person I have to go down there. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been in criminal a long time. He was interested in coming out long 
before the D.A. started this," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Storch's reassignment and Aldrich's departure, Superior Court 
Judge Joe D. Hadden will fill Storch's slot on the criminal bench. Johnson will 
temporarily take over family law cases, which Hadden now handles. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said she will fill in for Hadden until Gov. Pete Wilson appoints a new 
jurist or makes an early appointment of Colleen Toy White, who was elected to 
the Superior Court in June but is scheduled to begin her term in January. All 
the changes are effective Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Storch's transfer follows an aggressive response by court officials to 
Bradbury's order that prosecutors ban Storch from criminal cases.  
</P>
<P>
 Weeks ago, judges began assigning all new felony cases to Storch, forcing 
deputy prosecutors to use up their one chance to disqualify a judge without 
having to prove bias. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Bradbury nor his top aides were available for comment Wednesday. 
Public Defender Kenneth I. Clayman said he did not believe Storch's transfer 
was tied to Bradbury's tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't seem to me that the court would switch in midstream unless it had 
to do with making it a more efficient court. I think they really indicated they 
were standing up to the D.A.," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has happened is a series of events where they were caught shorthanded 
and they wanted to get the best possible use of their personnel," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other defense attorneys viewed the changes as necessary for the court to run 
smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be silly to keep Judge Storch in a courtroom with no cases coming to 
him," said Ventura attorney George Eskin. "From the utilization of personnel, 
it was imperative that Judge Johnson find another spot for him and this is an 
ideal opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that Storch's new position would "insulate him from the indignity of 
the district attorney's behavior."

JUDGE VOIDS FALL BALLOT INITIATIVE ON LANDFILL; WELDON CANYON: JURIST CALLS THE 
MEASURE 'CLEARLY INVALID.' BUT PROJECT SUPPORTERS PLEDGE AN IMMEDIATE APPEAL OF 
THE RULING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN and JOANNA MILLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge struck the Weldon Canyon landfill initiative from the fall ballot 
Wednesday, calling the measure an "egregious attempt" to grab power from 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was clearly invalid," retired Appeals Judge Richard W. Abbe said 
after filing the one-page writ in Ventura County Superior Court. "It was an 
attempt to award land-use rights to a private company." 
</P>
<P>
 But landfill supporters pledged an immediate appeal of the judge's ruling in 
the hope of giving county residents a chance to vote on the controversial 
project in November. 
</P>
<P>
 "We anticipated that we would have a difficult time getting a fair hearing in 
Ventura County with a rent-a-judge from Santa Barbara County," said Jim Jevens, 
a consultant on the Weldon project. "It comes down to a 15-round fight, and 
we're going to keep battling." 
</P>
<P>
 Abbe, a retired jurist living in Santa Barbara, was picked for the case only 
after five Ventura County judges removed themselves or were disqualified. After 
an initial hearing in July, landfill supporters accused him of bias and tried 
unsuccessfully to disqualify him. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed landfill has long divided county residents, with the cities of 
Ojai and Ventura vehemently opposing a dump nearby and east county residents 
accepting the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 A San Diego County partnership, Taconic Resources, decided to capitalize on 
the split between county residents and to place the issue on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 When the firm's spring petition drive drew more than 32,000 signatures, the 
Ventura County Board of Supervisors said it had little choice but to add the 
measure to the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Ojai and Ventura filed suit, asking a judge to declare the measure legally 
invalid and remove it from the ballot. An Ojai citizens coalition also sought 
an injunction. And the county joined the cities' legal challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 The opponents pressed the judge to decide the issue before the election -- and 
to leave enough time for appeals before the county prints its ballots in late 
September for the Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbe acknowledged Wednesday that it was unusual for a judge to void a ballot 
measure before the voters have a chance to speak. "But it's justified when it's 
clearly invalid beyond a doubt, and I believe it was," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "His ruling is exceptional," said John Nava, an activist with the Coalition to 
Stop Weldon Canyon Dump. "And it's only done when something is really, really 
out of whack or really, really illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Chase, a Taconic Resources partner, defended his project as sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "Technically it's a good site, and economically it's a good site. And it has 
basic political support from the voters across the county, which is obviously 
why the opposition didn't want it to go to a vote," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase said he had not yet seen the judge's ruling, which was filed late 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbe said he agreed with all the arguments the cities made in their legal 
briefs and in a daylong hearing Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a nutshell, opponents argued that the initiative process, created to give 
power to voters, was being perverted to grant land-use rights to a private 
firm. They also argued that the measure would create inconsistencies in the 
county's zoning and land-use plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some supporters acknowledged that the novel approach to county planning 
worried them. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I have supported the possibility of Weldon Canyon as a landfill for 
Ventura County, I have been concerned from the beginning about this initiative 
measure," Supervisor Vicky Howard said. "I had serious concerns about the 
legality, particularly the portion that would rezone the property without the 
usual procedures by the county."

 Chase, who is trying to use the same approach in San Diego County, said such 
setbacks are all part of the risky landfill business. "When you get involved in 
litigation and controversial projects, these things occur," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But landfill foes hope the legal setbacks will be enough to scare off the 
project's financial backers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Taconic retains a right of appeal, as well it should, but we're certain that 
any investors in this already outdated landfill technology will be treating 
Taconic like rats on a sinking ship," said Greg Helms, spokesman for the 
Environmental Defense Council.

VENTURA COUNTY FAIR; FAIR ANIMALS TUG AT KIDS' HEARTSTRINGS 
</P>

 Jared Williams has a big, stubborn lamb.  
</P>
<P>
 Spud does not come when called, does not walk when placed in the halter and 
will not stand still unless ordered to move. 
</P>
<P>
 But 10-year-old Jared loves the fleecy white critter he has raised from wobbly 
infancy to full-blown, leash-tugging beast. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always thought he was so cute because he's got these little gray hairs and 
he has the biggest nose," he said, trying to stroke the lamb's snout as Spud 
worked to free his head from the halter.  
</P>
<P>
 Jared knows he has to get a grip. At the end of this week, in all likelihood, 
Spud will go to the slaughterhouse, his cute white legs ending up just another 
chop wrapped in Styrofoam and cellophane in the meat case of some local 
supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
 Like his older sister and hundreds of other children across the county, Jared 
raised an animal for show this week at the Ventura County Fair. And like the 
other children, Jared will sell his lamb at the annual livestock auction on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's family worries that the sale will break his heart. But Jared thinks 
he can handle it. "It'll be tough, but like I always say, it's a way of life," 
he said, mustering a weak smile. "It's the way it has to be."  
</P>
<P>
 Some youngsters participate in the fair's large livestock competition as part 
of their local 4-H club, a youth organization with farming roots whose letters 
stand for Head, Heart, Hands and Health. Others enter along with their high 
school Future Farmers of America class.  
</P>
<P>
 Jared belongs to Timber 4-H, his neighborhood club in Thousand Oaks. He is too 
young to be a Future Farmer and anyway, they don't offer that class in the 
Conejo Valley schools.  
</P>
<P>
 Spud came into this world on Feb. 16 and has belonged to Jared ever since. 
Jared walks him every day to build up his muscle, feeds him, grooms him, plays 
with him and talks to him. At the fair this week, Jared tugged Spud through a 
competition to determine how fit he is for market -- Spud fell into the "B" 
class of lambs -- and he will attempt later this week to coax the animal 
through a showmanship contest.  
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Jared will put Spud on the auction block. If the little boy is 
lucky, a breeder will purchase Spud and the lamb will live to sire many 
progeny. But more likely, the lamb will be purchased for the flesh on his bones 
and killed Sunday evening just as the fair draws to a close. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, when Jared needs to take a midday nap, he cuddles up next to 
Spud in his pen at the fair, puts his arms around the lamb's woolly neck, and 
falls asleep. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all children grow as attached to their animals as Jared has. In addition 
to sheep, youngsters raise goats, calves, steers and hogs for the fair 
competition. Many of those responsible for the swine exhibit a noticeable lack 
of sentimentality for their squealing, smelly charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Brian Cook, 16, of Mupu 4-H, who named his pig Breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he's kind of a hassle," Brian admitted as Breakfast snored away the 
afternoon. "He's lazy. The only fun part is the fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian especially likes the money. His pigs usually sell for around $600, and 
after he's paid his parents back what they laid out on the animal's food and 
board, he holds about $300 profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, he spent the money on a wet suit and clothes. The cash is usually 
gone within a week, however he chooses to spend it. 
</P>
<P>
 Other children put their money into a savings account for college, or store 
some away toward the purchase of a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Katie Puente, for example, looks at her hulking black steer, Dallas, and sees 
a bright red truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas weighs 1,280 pounds, and when he walks, his ponderous bulk shifts 
impressively between his meaty haunches. Sixteen-year-old Katie, of Somis 4-H, 
bought the steer back in October when he weighed only 600 pounds, and has 
nursed and exercised him to his considerable heft. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the money he will inevitably bring, Katie said Dallas is her proof 
that she can accomplish anything if she works hard enough. "I think I took good 
care of him," she said, glancing at her steer with a small smile. 
</P>
<P>
 As a sort of finishing touch to her fair preparations, Katie also mailed off 
10 letters to prospective buyers. Some kids post as many as 50 letters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tell them we have a steer and to come support it and the auction," she 
said. She sighed and shrugged. "You know the whole time that that's what's 
going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Few moments drive that reality home more clearly than the market competitions 
on Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday of this week. That's when the children strut 
their animals out onto a hay-carpeted auditorium floor, and officials imported 
from around the state judge the beasts on their value as a main course. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's one pig in here that I think just excels in terms of carcass 
potential," judge Jim Hyer of Porterville announced Wednesday morning as a 
jumble of pink swine jostled about the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has tremendous leanness, tremendous length of body," Hyer continued. 
"With her combination of lean muscle and design, she puts together an 
outstanding package." 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd cheered as Hyer bestowed first place on Tim Ryan, 16, of Frazier 
Park and his prize porker, No. 562 (Tim never got around to giving the pig a 
name). 
</P>
<P>
 The audience agreed enthusiastically with the judge's decision. The winning 
pig, said Wayne Lewis, a 4-H parent from Agoura, "is like an Arnold 
Schwarzenegger. She doesn't have a lot of fat in her that hides the muscle." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other parents, Lewis can talk about the animals' market values 
without a catch in his throat. To the parents and the leaders of 4-H and FFA, 
livestock competitions are about raising fine specimens of animals and 
instilling a solid sense of responsibility in their eager youth, many of whom 
are already polite and hard-working children. 
</P>
<P>
 The youngsters talk, too, about all the responsibility they are learning and 
spout readily a list of all the products made from the bone and muscle of their 
animals. 
</P>
<P>
 But their reasons for coming to the fair are different from the adults'. 
</P>
<P>
 Some kids just want to have fun and pocket the auction cash. Others fall in 
love, again and again, year after year. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacey Walker, 12, of Somis 4-H, still misses Peaches and Pig Newtons, her hogs 
from 1992 and 1993, respectively. She knows she'll cry Sunday when they take 
Roastanne off to slaughter, even though the pig did try to attack her a couple 
of times, nipping her on the leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie Cummings of Timber 4-H also dreads the coming weekend. She's been 
crazy about Charlie ever since the day the lamb hit his head on the sidewalk 
and ran up to her to rub his sore noggin against her leg. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really attached to Charlie," the 14-year-old said. "They're judging for 
what he'd buy in the store, but he's so much more than that. He's got his own 
personality." 
</P>
<P>
 But as Stephanie and the other children in Timber 4-H know, no one's going to 
hurt more on Sunday than Jared. Spud is the first lamb he ever owned and he has 
worked with it so long and so hard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel so bad for him, 'cause (the judges) are going to think he didn't work 
with it, but the lamb just wouldn't give in," said his sister Cara, 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Jared tries, maybe caring for Spud more because he's so obstinate, 
walking him up and down the aisles at the fair's barn, trying to assert his 
mastery over the sheep. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the boss," Jared said, struggling with the lamb as it tried to run away 
from him, "but my lamb's pretty strong."  
</P>
<P>
 Jared likes to tell about Spud's good qualities -- how he nuzzles Jared, plays 
around with him, even jumps up on him and tries to "hug" him. So what if Spud 
always steps on his master's feet? They are pals. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get kinda mad when he doesn't listen to you," Jared said, wrestling with 
Spud to keep him in line for the fair's official weigh-in Monday night. "But 
it's been fun because he's a real fun lamb."

COUNTY HIRES OUTSIDE FIRMS IN HEALTH CARE SUIT; MEDICAL: DEFENSE TEAMS WILL 
FOCUS ON CLAIMS THE PUBLIC HOSPITAL COMPETES UNFAIRLY WITH PRIVATE SECTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County has hired two of the state's top law firms to defend the county 
hospital against charges that it is competing unfairly with the private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials, fighting a lawsuit filed last month by Community Memorial 
Hospital, could not say Wednesday how much the top-flight legal advice would 
cost them. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than we want to think about," said Noel Klebaum, the assistant county 
counsel assigned to the case for Ventura County Medical Center. "Right now it's 
very difficult to estimate." 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the investment could pay off if the attorneys specializing in 
health-care law help knock out the legal challenge in the early rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Memorial officials said the decision to consult outside attorneys 
suggests the county is taking the lawsuit seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they should be worried," said Donald Benton, who sits on the private 
hospital's board of trustees. But Benton, a lawyer himself, said Community 
Memorial need not worry about the county's hired guns. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it comes right down to it, any attorney can research the law," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two hospitals, just a few blocks from each other in Ventura, have been 
locked in a bitter feud for 1 1/2 years. This spring, Community Memorial fought 
to block a new outpatient wing proposed at the county hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The county submitted its plans for the $38-million project to state officials 
in June and has received the state's commitment to fund 70% of the project. 
Construction plans are still under review, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than focus on the new wing, Community Memorial's lawsuit centers on the 
claim that the county has overstepped its legal role to treat the poor and has, 
instead, tried to lure patients away from other hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, the public hospital is now offering a health plan for county 
employees. It also has established a network of clinics throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Community Memorial is asking the Superior Court to block the county from 
accepting privately insured patients and force it to handle more patients who 
are unable to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 County hospital officials contend they have never sought insured patients and 
say that only one in 10 of their patients has insurance policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The county was expected to file its formal response this week but asked for an 
extension until Sept. 9 and brought in the outside legal experts to help 
prepare the court papers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be certain we do a good job," Klebaum said. "This is a very 
complex field. It's not a field where there has been much done in terms of 
litigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the legal team assembled will have to research state laws and find 
related court cases to prepare its defense. To do so, the county has retained 
health care and litigation specialists at Los Angeles-based O'Melveny & Myers 
and the San Francisco firm of McCutchen, Doyle, Brown & Enersen. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Melveny & Myers is one of the state's largest and most prominent firms with 
more than 500 lawyers on staff. Secretary of State Warren Christopher headed 
the firm for years before President Clinton picked him for his cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 McCutchen, Doyle, Brown & Enersen has about 250 lawyers based in San 
Francisco, Los Angeles, San Jose and Walnut Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor John K. Flynn defended the county's decision to use 
independent counsel on the hospital suit. "I think it takes some experience to 
handle this type of case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged that the lawyers would cost the taxpayers, but put the blame 
on Community Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that the Memorial hospital is just totally off base," he said. 
"They're suing the taxpayers. That's what they're doing." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's an interesting comment," Community Memorial attorney John McDermott 
responded, "since part of what the lawsuit is about is saving the taxpayers 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're trying to do is to prevent the county from treating the patients 
they shouldn't be."

 Ventura fire officials Wednesday briefly barricaded off an area north of 
Buenaventura Golf Course after a sanitation worker discovered an abandoned 
barrel of what was feared to be hazardous material. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities later determined that the 55-gallon drum at 5700 Olivas Park Drive 
contained little more than oil, solvents and other similar materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, they closed a portion of Olivas Park Drive and Seaborg Avenue from 7:35 
a.m. to about 10 a.m., Battalion Chief Roger Morgenthaler of the Ventura Fire 
Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 No evacuations were necessary, although traffic to the adjacent light 
industrial area -- as well as contestants in a Wednesday golf tournament -- had 
to be rerouted, Morgenthaler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Rust, an assistant pro at the city-owned golf course, said the 127 
golfers in the tournament experienced only minor inconvenience. GREG RIPPEE

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Oxnard store manager who shot and wounded a suspected shoplifter on Aug. 4 
was justified because the teen-ager threatened an employee with a knife, 
prosecutors have concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt that under the circumstances, it was reasonable for him to respond 
with deadly force," Deputy Dist. Atty.Donald M. Grant said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ibrahim Himideh, 33, manager of Oxnard Ranch Market, fired one bullet from a 
.25-caliber semiautomatic handgun and struck the 16-year-old suspect as the 
youth was lunging at a store employee, police have said. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth was treated for a gunshot wound at St. John's Regional Medical 
Center. Authorities have refused to comment on the severity of the wound. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Detective Mike Palmier said an employee had followed the suspect to the 
parking lot after seeing the youth take three cans of styling mousse. 
</P>
<P>
 A confrontation ensued, authorities said, during which the 16-year-old 
displayed a knife and made a move toward the employee, prompting Himideh to 
fire. GREG RIPPEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: FILLMORE; RESTORATION ASSURED AT TOWNE THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Fillmore has received a contract from state historical 
preservation officials guaranteeing almost $450,000 for restoration of the 
cracked and crumbled Towne Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city has not yet received a check, the contract ensures that 
Fillmore will get the money, Councilman Roger Campbell said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have already gotten to the point of asking for proposals from architects," 
Campbell said. "This has all happened very quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake caused extensive damage to many Fillmore 
buildings, including the Towne Theater, a vaudeville-era stage and movie house 
in the center of town. 
</P>
<P>
 The city Redevelopment Agency bought the building this spring because agency 
directors wanted to ensure that it was restored, not demolished. The Fillmore 
Film Commission has been meeting regularly to study restoration proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the state grant, the city will receive just over $446,000 to pay for the 
building's renovation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know how far the money is going to go," film commission Chairman 
John McKinnon said Wednesday. "I'm sure the architects and engineers will take 
a good part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission has begun planning a series of fund-raisers to generate more 
money to pay for improvements to the theater, where officials hope to stage 
plays, host speakers and offer first-run movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell said 10 architectural bids have been received so far and that a 
contract could be awarded as soon as next month. No estimate on the total cost 
of repairs will be available until initial renderings are completed, he said.

<P>
 A Ventura-based law school founded seven years ago has won preliminary 
accreditation from the California State Bar, a first step toward making it the 
second fully approved law school in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California Institute of Law received preliminary accreditation 
for its Ventura campus after a committee of attorneys from the State Bar 
visited the campus, attended class and inspected the curriculum. 
</P>
<P>
 The school, which has about 70 students, will now have three years to act on 
recommendations from the State Bar and apply for full accreditation. 
</P>
<P>
 The institute, based at 1280 S. Victoria Ave., has not yet received 
preliminary accreditation for its satellite campus in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Students at unaccredited law schools must pass the "baby bar" exam during 
their first year in order to be eligible later for the State Bar exam. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura College of Law is the only fully accredited law school operating in 
Ventura County. The school has 185 students enrolled at its Ventura campus and 
135 in Santa Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert L. Plunkett, vice dean of the Southern California Institute of Law, 
said the school offers a four-year program of evening classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vast majority of our students are people who are already working," he 
said. JULIE FIELDS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: HOMES SALES RISE AS PRICES DECLINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Home sales in Ventura County continued to rise during July, driven up by 
bargain seekers and first-time home buyers, according to a report released this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Nima Nattagh, an analyst with TRW REDI, which publishes the report, said 5,749 
homes were sold in the county between January and July, or 19.2% more than in 
the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is pretty much a continuation of what we've been seeing," Nattagh said. 
"It's a good, healthy market. 
</P>
<P>
 "But at the same time there is a considerable shift in activity towards 
lower-priced homes in the less-than-$175,000 range," he said. "The market is 
really being driven by entry-level buyers. Prices are soft." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 37% of the homes sold were priced under $175,000. The average price for 
a home purchased in the last seven months was $228,471. For the same period 
last year, it was $234,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Rising interest rates have yet to show an effect on the real estate market, 
Nattagh said. 
</P>
<P>
 "At about 8.5%, the interest rates are obviously higher than the average rates 
from last year," he said. "But if you look back historically, say to 1989, the 
peak of the market, the interest rate was 10.32%. So rates are still in low in 
comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe there is going to be a significant negative effect on the 
housing market from the change in interest rates," he added. "But if there is, 
it probably won't show up for a while." MARY F. POLS

 A police storefront station is scheduled to open Oct. 1 in downtown Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 The station will occupy about 120 square feet in an abandoned bank building 
the city owns at 18 High St. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the building will be used by Charles Abbott & Associates, which 
does contract engineering work for the city. Abbott & Associates will make 
about $40,000 in renovations to the building in lieu of rent for the next two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20 local residents have volunteered to work at the storefront, which 
will be used as a clearinghouse for information on local law enforcement and 
crime prevention. It is expected to be open about 40 hours a week. The 
volunteers will be asked to staff the storefront desk for four hours each week. 
</P>
<P>
 A Ventura County Sheriff's Department cadet will work at the storefront 
station about 20 hours a week, and volunteers will supplement the cadet's time, 
said Lt. Martin Rouse, who heads the Moorpark Enforcement Division for the 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Rouse said he hopes to have the facility staffed totally by 
volunteers.  
</P>
<P>
 Deputies from the Moorpark Enforcement Division will drop by the facility on 
patrol, possibly using the site to write up police reports, Rouse said. City 
officials hope that the increased police presence downtown will make people 
more comfortable and improve business on High Street. 
</P>
<P>
 A grand opening will follow the annual Moorpark Country Days Parade, Rouse 
said. For more information about volunteering, call Deputy Jody Keller at 
494-8258. SCOTT HADLY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: MOTORCYCLISTS REV UP FOR BENEFIT RIDE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 About 2,000 motorcyclists are expected to participate Sunday in the Lorenzo 
Lamas Second Annual "Ride for Life" from Newhall to Lake Casitas. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamas, the star of "Renegade" on Fox TV, will lead the ride, which begins at 
10 a.m. at Valencia Plaza, 24508 Lyons Ave., Newhall, winds along California 
126 and up through the Ojai Valley on California 150 before arriving at the 
lake 70 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Cyclists pay $30 per person to participate in the ride, which includes a 
barbecue lunch with live music and entertainment at the lake. Profits go to the 
World Children's Transplant Fund, which provides donor organs for children. 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment includes Lamas' TV sidekick, Brandscombe Richmond, and his band, 
the Renegade Posse. A second set will be performed by Texas Flood. Comedians 
will also be on hand, along with Ojai-area vendors selling everything from food 
to motorcycle paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers encourage those interested to sign up in advance, as the 2,000 
slots for the event may sell out, said Dana Tkac, ride coordinator and 
executive director of the World Children's Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 If slots are still available, participants can register from 8 to 10 a.m. the 
morning of the ride at the starting site. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information or to receive a registration form by fax, call (818) 
905-9283. JOANNA M. MILLER

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; DEVELOPER AGAIN ASKS FOR EXEMPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Irvine-based development company planning to build 3,200 houses in 
northeast Moorpark has reiterated its request that the city exempt the planned 
community from any future or existing growth-control ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 The request comes on the heels of a negotiated agreement between the city and 
another developer, the Carlsberg Financial Corp. That agreement exempts 
Carlsberg's 552-house development from any future growth-control ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the Messenger Investment Co. have said they would also like 
such an exemption. The company plans to build its housing over a 12-year period 
on the former Hidden Creek Ranch property, just outside town. Messenger Vice 
President Gary Austin said the company would not be able to complete the 
project under the existing slow-growth law or a possibly stricter law that 
could replace it when it expires in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Austin has repeatedly asked the Moorpark City Council to consider drawing up a 
development agreement with specific yearly limits on housing units that would 
apply only to Messenger. In exchange, the company would build certain roads, 
sewer and water systems before the housing is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would effectively manage growth and keep us in business," Austin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The current growth-control ordinance, called Measure F, allows for no more 
than 270 building permits to be issued each year. A proposed extension of the 
ordinance to take effect when Measure F expires in 1995 would lower the number 
to 250 and also not allow any single developer to receive more than half of 
those allotments. Austin said his company wants to build 400 houses each of the 
first two years of the project, and 300 houses thereafter until the development 
is complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be excluded from any existing or future ordinance," he said. "It 
wouldn't work otherwise." SCOTT HADLY

SCHOOL PUTS EMPHASIS ON HELP BEYOND THE CLASSROOM; VENTURA: AT THE POOREST 
CAMPUS IN THE DISTRICT, FREE INDIVIDUAL AND FAMILY THERAPY IS PROVIDED ALONG 
WITH IMMUNIZATIONS, CHECKUPS AND CLOTHING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the space of just one week last spring, Sheridan Way School Principal Trudy 
Arriaga got three visits from parents seeking help. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing unusual about that, except these parents were not asking how to get 
their children to study more or behave better in class. 
</P>
<P>
 One distraught mother asked Arriaga for help getting the local utility 
companies to turn her family's gas and electricity back on. 
</P>
<P>
 Another brought in divorce papers that her husband had just filed and which 
she could not understand because they were in English. And the third said she 
needed to find Alcoholic Anonymous meetings for her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriaga helped all three. 
</P>
<P>
 At Sheridan Way, the poorest school in the Ventura Unified School District, 
Arriaga and her staff members believe they can only expect children to succeed 
in the classroom if they help them to thrive outside of school. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Sheridan Way in west Ventura has become the first school in the 
district and one of the first in the county to bring nurses and other medical 
workers on campus to administer shots and physical checkups to neighborhood 
children up to 18 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 A county mental health counselor also comes to the school twice a week to give 
free individual and family therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 And the school operates a clothes closet jammed with hundreds of donated 
shirts, coats and shoes that are given free to children's families. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step, Sheridan Way officials say, is to soon bring a county social 
worker to the school to help parents get other public services. 
</P>
<P>
 "The children at our school don't have telephones to call doctors," Arriaga 
said. "They don't have cars to get to clinics. They don't have parents who 
speak English who are able to be their advocates." 
</P>
<P>
 School district officials could say "tough luck," Arriaga said. "But then what 
happens is the child isn't able to be successful in school." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the roughly 500 kindergarten-through-fifth-grade students at Sheridan Way, 
half have only limited English. About 50 of the children come from families 
that are homeless. And 99% are poor enough to qualify for federally subsidized 
lunches. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the parents have jobs. Some work at local fast-food restaurants, in 
small factories or in agriculture, teacher Susan Eberhart said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But they are barely making enough to support their families," she said. 
"These are working people who do not have health insurance." 
</P>
<P>
 In a survey last year of Sheridan Way families, school officials found that 
only 10% are insured either through Medi-Cal or private plans. 
</P>
<P>
 And while nearly all the families qualify for welfare, only 8% receive it, 
officials said. Many immigrant parents are too frightened of the questions that 
government officials may ask on immigration status to go to public agencies for 
help -- even though many of them have U.S.-born children, Eberhart said. 
</P>
<P>
 But many of these same parents feel comfortable coming to Sheridan Way. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have come here that wouldn't go other places," Eberhart said. "We're 
safe." 
</P>
<P>
 The school is not only welcoming to parents, it is close to their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Without insurance or the money to pay for medical care, many Sheridan Way 
families tend to postpone medical care until minor complaints become major 
maladies, Eberhart said. 
</P>
<P>
 More than one Sheridan Way child has suffered a broken eardrum caused by an 
untreated ear infection, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others come to school severely nearsighted but with no eyeglasses, with 
rotting teeth and no dental care or without having been immunized against mumps 
and other childhood diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning last spring, nurses and medical workers from county Public Health 
Services have operated a clinic every two weeks in a back room at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the county pays upfront for the service, it is reimbursed by the 
state so long as the clinic draws enough patients. And public health officials 
said that so far they have had no trouble attracting enough patients. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen parents and children filled the clinic room Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to giving immunizations and testing for anemia and other health 
problems, the medical workers also check the children's teeth, eyesight and 
hearing. Treatment is covered under the state-funded program. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernestina Villegas came to the clinic Wednesday with her third-grade daughter 
Belen because she was concerned about a rash on the girl's ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 But both the girl and the mother were relieved to learn from pediatric nurse 
Linda McDermott that the itchy rash was just spider bites. 
</P>
<P>
 McDermott explained to Villegas various ways to prevent bites, such as keeping 
the ceiling around Belen's bed cleared of webs. 
</P>
<P>
 And she also prescribed hot compresses and a medicated cream. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to fix her up," the nurse said.

 Do I have any sympathy for Bruce McNall, who seemed like such a nice guy? . .

 McNall charmed people into losing millions of dollars. . . .

 This is the best week of the NFL exhibition season -- the last week. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Two exhibition games, not four or five, would be about right. In contrast, a 
lot of college teams open the season with a conference game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Denver quarterback John Elway summed it up well when asked why he won't play 
tonight against Arizona: "This game means absolutely nothing." . . .

 I still wish the Clippers would make a trade with Miami for Harold Miner, who 
would bring some excitement to the Sports Arena. . . .

 An Oscar De La Hoya-Genaro Hernandez nontitle bout is a possibility for early 
next year. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The question is whether Meldrick Taylor has anything left, but he reportedly 
is in terrific physical condition for his rematch against Julio Cesar Chavez 
Sept. 17 at the MGM Grand Garden. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Don Chargin reports that his unbeaten Yory Boy Campas, who has 51 knockouts in 
56 bouts and challenges Felix Trinidad for the International Boxing Federation 
welterweight title on the Chavez-Taylor card, has joined the growing list of 
fighters training at high altitude in Big Bear. . . .

 Bob Arum, who is staging a personal campaign to keep boxing alive, will

 On Zachary Padilla Day in Azusa on Saturday, a city street will be named in 
honor of one of boxing's most exciting and hardest-working performers and he

<P>
 One of the finest prospects in any division is Lou Duva's unbeaten

 UCLA coaches believe the most underrated player on the team is 6-foot-8, 
315-pound left tackle Jonathan Ogden, whose most important responsibility is to 
protect quarterback Wayne Cook from blindside hits. . . .

 Ogden, a junior who finished fourth in the NCAA indoor shotput competition, is 
a preseason All-Pacific 10 Conference choice, but the Bruins think he deserves 
All-American billing. . . .

 Among UCLA's most talented true freshmen is cornerback Javelin Guidry, younger 
brother of starting safety Paul Guidry. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 I just hope Javelin doesn't get called for any spearing penalties. . . .

<P>
 Fresno State beating Ohio State in the Disneyland Pigskin Classic at Anaheim 
Stadium Monday night would surprise me more than the Bulldogs did when they 
upset USC two years ago in the same stadium. . . .

<P>
 That was USC's last game of the season, an anti-climatic bowl game. This will 
be Ohio State's first game of the season. The Buckeyes will be psyched up. . .

 Besides, Fresno State no longer has Trent Dilfer. . . .

BOOK REVIEW / NOVEL; FINDING TRUTH AS DEATH LOOMS; ONE TRUE THING BY ANNA 
QUINDLEN ; RANDOM HOUSE $22, 320 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL DORRIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What a treat to read a good story told by a smart, if not always likable, 
narrator. We meet Ellen Gulden, the young woman at the heart of Pulitzer 
Prize-winning columnist Anna Quindlen's provocative second novel (the 
best-selling "Object Lessons" was her first), soon after she's graduated from 
Harvard and taken a magazine job in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The brightest and eldest of three children, she has always seen herself and 
been seen by others as her English professor father's clone -- literate, 
ironic, ambitious -- rather than her homemaker mother's daughter. Her life to 
date has been one academic triumph after another, your basic 99 percentile on 
the SATs type-A personality. She's used to being in control, used to pleasant 
surprises, used to success. 
</P>
<P>
 And then her mother gets cancer. Her mother, Kate, whom Ellen has always 
regarded with affectionate condescension. Her mother the famous decorator of 
community Christmas trees. Her mother the why-buy-it-when-you-can-make-it 
craftsperson. Her mother the indestructible domestic.  
</P>
<P>
 Ellen complies with great resentment to her father's demand that she relocate 
back home to manage the illness, a move that is clearly equally as difficult 
for her mother. Ellen is the girl child -- far less involvement is expected of 
her younger brothers. Telling herself that the situation is only temporary, for 
her mother's diagnosis is terminal, she does her duty. 
</P>
<P>
 As Quindlen deftly moves her story forward, the first jolt for Ellen -- and 
for us -- is the emergence of the real Kate Gulden. Forced to deal with her 
mother as a person and not just a parent, Ellen finds the 40-something Kate to 
be far more self-aware, complicated, and stoic than she ever suspected, a 
mature woman who has acquired wisdom that Ellen is intrigued to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 "The being happy," her mother explains. "It's so much easier, to learn to love 
what you have instead of yearning always for what you're missing, or what you 
imagine you're missing. It's so much more peaceful." 
</P>
<P>
 When mother and daughter form a book club consisting of only themselves, Kate 
reveals that she's always been bored and annoyed with Jane Austen's depiction 
of proper and contented female characters -- the very type of woman Ellen has 
always imagined Kate to admire, to, in fact, be. "We'd made her simpler all her 
life, simpler than her real self," Ellen explains to her brother. "We'd made 
her what we needed her to be. We'd made her ours, our one true thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost simultaneously with drawing closer to Kate, Ellen's estimation of her 
father diminishes -- first from what strikes her as the unfairness of his 
imposition on her time, and later because of what she regards as his avoidance 
of his husbandly responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The family dynamic changes, evolves, divides for the first time along gender 
lines. Ultimately Ellen must accept the fact that she has had less of a 
comprehension of the inherent compromises of her parents' union than she once 
imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one knows what goes on inside a marriage," she concludes. "I read that 
once; the aphorism ended 'except for the two people who are in it.' But I 
suspect that even that is not the truth, that even two people married to each 
other for many many years may have only passing similarities in their 
perceptions and their expectations. . . . But I know from experience that those 
least capable of truly assessing any marriage are the children who come out of 
it. We style them as we need them, to excuse our faults, to insulate ourselves 
from our own expendability or indispensability." 
</P>
<P>
 And then, one terrible night, Kate dies. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a mercy, almost anyone would agree. Kate had ceased to be herself, was 
subsumed by suffering. Her death was for the best, it would appear -- until an 
autopsy reveals that the cause was not natural but an overdose of pain- 
killers. Ellen is falsely accused of euthanasia, and though she steadfastly 
denies committing the deed -- more, she judges, from a lack of courage than 
from any moral or philosophical hesitations -- she is arrested and charged with 
the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 In the process of awaiting an appearance before the grand jury, she becomes an 
unwilling poster girl for mercy killing, the unlikely catalyst for a raging 
national ethical debate, the public's champion for an act she didn't, in fact, 
perform . . . though she's sure she knows who did. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be unfair to the reader to reveal the outcome of this unfailingly 
interesting conundrum, except to say that Quindlen is far too complex a writer 
and a thinker to settle for any facile solutions. And all along the way to the 
novel's believable, satisfying conclusion, we are presented with insights and 
challenges to ponder, ideas that resonate concerning the nature and the method 
of change. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, like Ellen herself, we leave "One True Thing" stimulated and 
challenged, more thoughtful than when we began.

CHURCH 'SQUANDERS' ITS MORAL CAPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Father Gregory Coiro accurately portrayed the position of the Catholic Church 
when he condemned the civil marriage of Jennifer, 17, and Caesar Espinoza, 25, 
("They Say Love Conquers All -- Will It Now?" Aug. 8). 
</P>
<P>
 "It's totally ludicrous to teach the sanctimony of the sacrament of matrimony 
and then have a Catholic young person thumbing her nose at the sacrament." 
</P>
<P>
 What is the message of the archdiocese in this case? Answer: The rules and 
principles of the church will be absolutely defended despite their impact upon 
the faithful. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, the church is bogged down in legalism rather than considering 
greater values such as love, commitment and faith. 
</P>
<P>
 When religion is at its best it provides a supportive community, has an alive 
morality and adds meaning to people's lives -- and many spiritual communities 
even within the Catholic Church continue to do this. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in cases like the Espinozas', the church is squandering its moral 
capital in issues that obscure the essential message of the Gospels. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, how old was Mary when she was betrothed to Joseph? Oh, well, 
another young person who thumbed her nose at the sacraments.

FOUNTAIN STORY: POETRY OR RULE BREAKING? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bob Sipchen's story "Sharing the Fountain of Youth" (Aug. 4) is an incredibly 
poetic piece of writing. The Times is lucky and blessed to have writers of such 
talent. 
</P>
<P>
 I have written so many letters critical of Times articles and editorials. I 
just had to say, the good is equal to the bad. 
</P>
<P>
 MARK CHRISTIAN, Los Angeles The problem with Bob Sipchen's piece was its smug 
description of allowing his children to sneak, flaunt society's unspoken 
boundaries, avoid authority . . . all for the purpose of self-gratification. 
Usually answered with, "But it didn't hurt anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 In the recent past, Al Martinez and Robin Abcarian have also written smug 
pieces telling of their pleasure in being able to flaunt rules, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't there some area in newspapers anymore where we can enjoy high standards, 
experience ethics and values? When we read the news it's about murders, 
robberies, law-breaking, etc. 
</P>
<P>
 When journalists have choices to write about, couldn't it be something other 
than more rule-bending and law-breaking or law testing?

 NOT SO NAKED CITY: With many cities facing legal challenges to their laws 
regarding nudity, Seal Beach isn't taking any chances with loopholes or vague 
language. This week it passed a 27-page ordinance on sex -- with language 
explicit enough to merit its own X-rating -- that covers almost any situation. 
. . . Example: Nudity at its parks or beach is out, and so are T-shirts or 
costumes that display nudity. Also: It's OK to breast-feed at the beach, but 
only if the infant is under 2 years of age. 
</P>
<P>
 EARLY LESSONS: As a Fullerton teen-ager, the famed singer-songwriter Jackson 
Browne made pocket money by giving guitar lessons. His students were among the 
first to learn the songs Browne wrote as a 15-year-old beginner. . . . Browne, 
who plays Saturday at Irvine Meadows (OC Live!), recalls that his roster of 
students dwindled when he upped his rates in a scramble to raise money for a 
new guitar. It seems a burglar had made off with his favorite instrument. 
</P>
<P>
 KICKED INTO CLASS: At Orange County country music station KIK-FM (94.3), they 
call their fans KIK-ers. For Jacqueline Frank of Fountain Valley, being a 
KIK-er has paid off. She recently won KIK's $7,800 scholarship to attend the 
Academy of Radio Broadcasting in Huntington Beach. . . . Frank, whose dream is 
to be a deejay, says of her new classes: "I'm such a music enthusiast, but that 
excitement alone won't make you the world's greatest deejay." 
</P>
<P>
 FIGHTING WITH ZIP: Tiny Villa Park has for years been seeking its own postal 
ZIP code, instead of sharing one with part of its big neighbor, the city of 
Orange. It's not just for status, Villa Park officials say, noting that ZIP 
code areas are often used for such things as insurance rates. . . . Now, says 
Mayor Barry L. Denes, little Villa Park has a big ally -- California's U.S. 
Sen. Barbara Boxer. He says Boxer recently roasted postal officials with a 
letter on the city's behalf. Says the mayor: "She used language I enjoyed 
reading."

 OPPOSITES: Northridge's A.J. Langer, 20, plays Rayanne, the brash party girl

 The Czech Cabinet on Wednesday approved a gesture to compensate Czechs who 
were held in Nazi concentration camps during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The government will give a one-time payment of $82 for every month of 
detention to Czechs imprisoned by the Nazis during the 1938-1945 German 
occupation of Czechoslovakia. The payment will be made to surviving spouses of 
former prisoners who have died but not to their children.

SIMPSON TEAM UNPLUGS HOT LINE; INVESTIGATION: QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF TIPS HAS 
DWINDLED, DEFENSE SAYS. GRAND JURY HEARS SEVERAL WITNESSES IN COWLINGS CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Calls to a hot line created for tipsters with possible leads in the O.J. 
Simpson murder case have dropped off so precipitously in recent weeks that his 
attorneys have decided for now to pull the plug on the highly publicized 
effort, members of Simpson's defense camp said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like anything, the initial impact was the biggest," said Robert L. Shapiro, 
one of Simpson's attorneys. "Since then, it's worn off some." 
</P>
<P>
 In its first week of operation, the toll-free number received thousands of 
calls -- Simpson's attorneys say they logged more than 250,000 tips within 
days, a rush so intense that they were forced to install extra lines to record 
comments deluging the hot line. 
</P>
<P>
 Many calls came from people sympathetic to the football great, charged with 
murdering Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman. Others sought to cash 
in on Simpson's offer of a $500,000 reward for information leading to the 
arrest of the "real killer or killers." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the weeks since that first burst of phone calls, members of Simpson's 
team say the quantity and quality of calls have tapered off dramatically. In 
recent weeks, tantalizing tips mostly have been replaced by wackier offerings 
and meddlesome wanna-be investigators, Simpson's representatives say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Initially, it was a very good idea," said Bill Pavelic, an investigative 
consultant working with the Simpson team who recommended that the hot line be 
shut down. "We got a lot of good leads. But the calls lately have not been as 
good. We get people who want to tell us how to do things, not people who have 
information." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of that, the service was temporarily disconnected. Shapiro said 
Simpson's attorneys expect to decide later this week whether to leave it off 
permanently. Tuesday, callers got a recorded message saying that the number was 
"temporarily out of service." 
</P>
<P>
 Police and prosecutors say they too have seen a drop-off in credible tips. 
Calls and letters continue to arrive from assorted psychics and others who are 
bothered by dreams or visions, but new clues are becoming harder to come by. 
Where once several letters arrived each day, investigators now are lucky to get 
one or two, and those usually are not productive, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators continue to work with the clues they have, however, 
simultaneously moving against Simpson and probing possible charges against his 
friend Al Cowlings. Preliminary DNA test results point to Simpson as a likely 
source of blood drops found at the crime scene. Microscopic analysis of hairs 
discovered in a knit cap at the scene revealed that they resemble Simpson's, 
sources told The Times on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowlings case, meanwhile, is under investigation by the Los Angeles County 
Grand Jury, which met again Wednesday. Among the latest witnesses was Dr. Henry 
C. Lee, who was asked to testify about the events of June 17, when Simpson 
failed to surrender and instead disappeared with Cowlings for nearly six hours 
before being spotted driving on an Orange County freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a dozen people were at the Encino home of Robert Kardashian on the 
morning before Simpson and Cowlings left the residence. Virtually all of them 
have been ordered to testify before the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 The only exceptions, sources close to the case say, are Simpson and Shapiro. 
Kardashian has fought his subpoena, but may still be required to take the 
witness stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Kardashian's fiancee, Denice Shakarian-Halicki, responded to her subpoena 
Wednesday, arriving for the grand jury session accompanied by two lawyers. She 
declined to comment to reporters waiting outside. She is expected to testify 
again today. Paula Barbieri, Simpson's girlfriend, also is expected to testify. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, in his regular meeting with reporters, confirmed 
that the grand jury is investigating Cowlings' actions June 17, but said the 
panel is being used as an investigative tool, not to seek an indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We are there for strictly investigatory purposes," said Garcetti, who 
normally does not comment on the status or purpose of grand jury 
investigations. "It's a way to assist us in getting as much information as we 
can on whether or not Mr. Cowlings committed a crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Grand juries offer prosecutors an important tool in investigating crimes 
because they can issue subpoenas requiring witnesses to appear. It is that 
power that prosecutors are taking advantage of in the Cowlings case, Garcetti 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The grand jury has subpoena power; we don't," he said. "If someone thumbs 
their nose at us, they can't thumb their nose at the grand jury." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Garcetti refused to comment specifically on the Simpson case, he said 
testimony gathered in the Cowlings investigation "can be used in any other 
criminal proceeding, as long as it is relevant." 
</P>
<P>
 Cowlings' attorney, Donald Re, said it would be inappropriate for Garcetti or 
any prosecutor to take a case to the grand jury with the intent of developing 
evidence against someone who already has been ordered to stand trial, in this 
case Simpson. But if the grand jury is investigating Cowlings and happens to 
come upon evidence relevant to the Simpson case, prosecutors could use that 
evidence, Re and other experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 That could prove helpful to the district attorney's office because the 
Cowlings grand jury presumably is attempting to develop information about 
Simpson's state of mind on the day that he failed to surrender on schedule. 
Investigators believe that Simpson was trying to flee prosecution when he and 
Cowlings left June 17. If prosecutors could prove that, it could help their 
cases against both men because flight to avoid prosecution could be introduced 
as evidence of Simpson's guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If Simpson was intending to flee and Cowlings knew that, it would bolster the 
prosecution case against Cowlings as well, because it would show that he 
intended to help a fugitive, not prevent a friend from committing suicide, as 
he has claimed. 
</P>
<P>
 "One never knows where a grand jury investigation is going to lead one," 
Garcetti said in response to questions about the Cowlings case. "If there's 
other evidence that comes out that assists us in another case, you're not going 
to turn your back on it." 
</P>
<P>
 According to sources familiar with the case, investigators discovered nearly 
$10,000 and a passport among Simpson's possessions when he was arrested June 
17. Cowlings had about $7,000, the sources added. 
</P>
<P>
 Friends of Simpson dismiss the importance of those discoveries. Several have 
said Simpson often traveled with large amounts of cash, and Re said the money 
that his client was carrying was given to him by Simpson to pass along to his 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 The next court action in the Simpson case is expected Friday, when Superior 
Court Judge Lance A. Ito has said he will rule on the issue of splitting blood 
samples taken from Simpson's home and car, as well as from the murder scene. 
That issue has occupied most of the past week and has pitted attorneys for the 
two sides in an increasingly testy battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark complained about a letter 
in which Shapiro publicly assailed the conduct of prosecutors. Ito said he was 
irritated by the behavior of lawyers on both sides, and later met behind closed 
doors with Clark and Shapiro to discuss his concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, in response to a question about publicity in the Simpson case, 
Garcetti said that prosecuting the former football player would be easier if 
Ito would issue a gag order preventing attorneys on both sides from publicly 
discussing the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've taken action" in that regard, Garcetti said, but declined to explain 
what that action was.

EX-PANTHER PRATT DENIED PAROLE FOR 13TH TIME; PRISON: HE CALLS PANEL MEMBERS 
POLITICAL PAWNS. D.A. IS REVIEWING A REPORT ARGUING HIS INNOCENCE IN THE 1968 
SANTA MONICA SLAYING OF A TEACHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Former Black Panther leader Elmer G. (Geronimo) Pratt was denied parole for 
the 13th time Wednesday by commissioners he later described as "pawns in the 
political manipulations engulfing me the whole time I've been in prison." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 50 of Pratt's supporters demonstrated outside the entrance of Mule 
Creek State Prison in this Amador County community as the three state Board of 
Prison Terms commissioners conducted the hearing inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt is serving a life sentence for the 1968 murder of schoolteacher Caroline 
Olsen and the wounding of her husband on a Santa Monica tennis court. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, whose office opposed parole 
Wednesday, has been reviewing Pratt's case since crusading lay minister Jim 
McCloskey, of New Jersey-based Centurion Ministries, submitted a detailed 
report arguing Pratt's innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Pratt and his attorneys did not expect to prevail at the parole 
hearing, they saw it as a forum to focus public attention on the case as 
Garcetti continues his review. 
</P>
<P>
 So many facts point to his innocence of the murder charge for which he has 
served 23 years in prison, Pratt said, that he can only hope that the truth 
will come out soon. 
</P>
<P>
 In denying Pratt parole, the panel said he would pose "an unreasonable risk to 
society." His crime was "callous," and he has "failed to demonstrate evidence 
of positive change," said board Chairman Steven G. Baker. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt has steadfastly maintained that he was in Oakland -- 400 miles away -- 
attending meetings of the Black Panther Party's central committee on Dec. 18, 
1968, when Olsen was shot to death during a robbery that netted less than $30. 
</P>
<P>
 He also insists that the FBI knew that he was in Oakland, but that he was 
framed as part of the bureau's infamous COINTELPRO program aimed at disrupting 
and neutralizing black organizations and leaders during the 1960s and 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's hearing was punctuated by sharp exchanges between parole board 
members and Pratt and his attorney, Stuart Hanlon. The board questioned why 
Pratt has been cited in two disciplinary reports since his hearing last year, 
why he has not accepted a work assignment, and why no letters were presented at 
this hearing indicating that he would have a job or that he would be able to 
live with his wife upon release. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt and Hanlon dismissed those questions as part of a political game. "We 
know you can create (disciplinary reports)," Hanlon said, adding that a federal 
judge has said that Pratt's treatment in California prisons is retaliatory. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, U.S. District Judge Stanley Weigel of San Francisco ruled that state 
prison officials apparently retaliated against Pratt after he gave a television 
interview saying that new evidence pointed to his innocence. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt was transferred in January to Mule Creek and housed with another inmate, 
rather than in a one-man cell as he has been during nearly all of his sentence. 
Putting Pratt in a double cell aggravates nightmares, insomnia and 
combat-related stress traceable to his Vietnam combat experiences, for which he 
was decorated, his doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weigel said Pratt's transfer was ordered, under unusual procedures that prison 
officials tried to conceal, two days after Pratt agreed to the television 
interview. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, parole board member Ron Koenig said it seemed that Pratt "still 
has a criminal mentality." Pratt responded: "I think you have a criminal 
mentality. There is a difference in the way we think." 
</P>
<P>
 He later said his mentality was not criminal during his days as a Black 
Panther because he was seeking "to free people who are in bondage." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of the work assignments that Pratt refused at Mule Creek would have 
required him to work with white inmates who belong to the Aryan Brotherhood, a 
white supremacist group, Hanlon said. Pratt refused the task to reduce the 
possibility of violence, Hanlon said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Pratt's residence and job prospects, his prison file is filled with 
dozens of letters offering employment -- including one from a university in the 
east African nation of Tanzania where he has been offered a teaching post, 
Pratt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Pratt's case since his arrest and conviction has been a political case," 
Hanlon told the panel. "He was arrested because he was a Black Panther. He has 
been punished in prison for political reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanlon also noted that Pratt asked to be represented by former Black Panther 
central committee member Kathleen Cleaver at Wednesday's hearing, but that she 
was not even allowed into the hearing room. Cleaver, a Yale Law School graduate 
and a law professor at Emory University in Atlanta, watched the hearing on a 
television monitor in an adjacent room. 
</P>
<P>
 Anything that Pratt might do to comply with parole conditions set by the board 
would be inadequate, Hanlon said, because he expects totally new conditions to 
be imposed at the next hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not allowed to talk about the fact that Pratt did not commit the 
murder," Hanlon said. "The man is not admitting it because he didn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The board denied parole for one year, but Koenig said he felt that a two-year 
denial should have been imposed, citing what he called Pratt's "criminal 
mentality," among other factors. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt was convicted of the Olsen murder in 1972, but defense lawyers and the 
jury did not know that a key prosecution witness had been providing information 
to the FBI; that Olsen's husband, Kenneth, had previously identified another 
suspect as the gunman; or that an FBI informant had infiltrated what an 
appellate court decision called the "defense environs." 
</P>
<P>
 Three jurors who convicted Pratt have said that they would not have done so 
had they known about Olsen's earlier identification of a suspect and that 
Julius C. Butler, the former Panther who implicated Pratt in the murder, had 
more than 30 documented contacts with the FBI over a two-year period before the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Pratt said he believes that his lawyers and investigators working with 
McCloskey are very close to finding the "smoking gun" that will reveal who 
killed Olsen. 
</P>
<P>
 McCloskey gained national attention in 1992 for winning the release of 
Clarence Chance and Benny Powell, two Los Angeles men who had served 17 years 
in prison after being wrongfully convicted of killing a sheriff's deputy.

BILL WOULD DOUBLE AID TO L.A. HOMELESS; SOCIAL SERVICES: THE CHANGE IN HUD 
PROCEDURE WOULD REPLACE COMPETITION FOR GRANTS WITH A FORMULA TO GIVE FUNDS TO 
CITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BORNEMEIER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Legislation is pending before Congress that would nearly double the amount of 
federal funds Los Angeles receives to combat the problems associated with the 
city's large homeless population. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed law, the city would receive its share of Department of 
Housing and Urban Development funds according to a formula, thus eliminating 
the annual competition for grants that is required under the current system. 
</P>
<P>
 The city received $20.6 million in HUD funds for various homeless programs in 
fiscal 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 If Congress approves the proposed HUD modifications -- part of an omnibus 
housing bill -- the city would be in line for nearly $40 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Other municipalities throughout the state would benefit from the proposed 
changes as well. For instance, the total of HUD funds for all Orange County 
cities for next year would be $2.83 million, compared to $253,277 in fiscal 
1993, HUD officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents say the new procedures will save the federal government 
administrative costs and provide the city with a more reliable source of money 
to provide shelter, food and counseling to the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles officials estimate that between 80,000 and 100,000 homeless people 
are in Los Angeles County, most in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Between fiscal 1987 and fiscal 1993, the city received an average of about $8 
million from HUD for homeless programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this program is approved, it would give the city a better opportunity to 
address the problem," said Gene Jackson, homeless coordinator for Los Angeles. 
"It appears to have the support of homeless advocates and city officials." 
</P>
<P>
 To qualify for the money, city officials would be required to develop a 
comprehensive strategy in dealing with homeless people. They would also have to 
set up a local advisory board to review applications for funds from local 
nonprofit groups and assist the city in developing policies on homeless issues. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The changes are part of a proposed overhaul of the Stewart B. McKinney 
Homeless Assistance Act of 1987 and reflect the views of HUD Secretary Henry G. 
Cisneros, who has placed a high priority on dealing with the problems of 
homeless Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 For 1995, the Clinton Administration is seeking $1 billion for the McKinney 
Act, up from $826 million budgeted this year. Provisions in the housing bill 
would consolidate several HUD programs into a new account, known as Homeless 
Assistance Grants. The money would be distributed to cities, states and 
regional homeless groups according to a formula based on the 1990 census. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget also includes $500 million in five-year rental certificates to help 
move 15,000 homeless families nationwide into subsidized private housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The House has already passed the housing bill that authorizes the new HUD 
procedures. A Senate committee has approved a similar measure, which is 
awaiting floor action. Appropriations bills have passed both houses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're confident that it will pass," said Andrew M. Cuomo, an assistant 
secretary at HUD who previously worked as a provider of homeless services in 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been working on the homeless problem for over a decade. We did some 
things right, we did some things wrong. One of the things we did wrong is never 
having a defined policy or an organized approach. Under this program, (Los 
Angeles) gets a substantial amount of money . . . and the control and authority 
to develop a system (to spend it)." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal was first met skeptically by some of the nonprofit agencies that 
now deal directly with HUD through a competitive application process. Under the 
new plan, the nonprofit agencies would work through the city and the local 
advisory board. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the beginning we were opposed to it," said Nan Roman, a vice president of 
Alliance to End Homelessness in Washington. "We were apprehensive that the 
money that once came to us would go to the city. And we didn't know exactly 
what the local advisory board would do." 
</P>
<P>
 But after helping to shape the legislation, the alliance supports its goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's exciting to see how it will come out. It will be stimulating to local 
(homeless) planners and local providers," Roman said.

LINK'S LETTERS; MEDIA: COMMON CAUSE HONORS CLARA LINK, 83, AS AN 'INDEFATIGABLE 
AGITATOR' FOR WRITING PROLIFICALLY TO EDITORS OVER THE LAST 40 YEARS. SHE SAYS 
SHE'S JUST AN EDUCATOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 This story had better turn out right or else the boss will hear about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Clara Link, after all, has never been timid about sitting down at her antique 
typewriter and pounding out a letter to the editor. 
</P>
<P>
 She has written hundreds of them over the last 40 years. And people seem to 
pay attention. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why the 83-year-old Pasadena widow has been named a winner of the 1994 
Public Service Achievement Award by Washington-based Common Cause. The public 
interest lobbying group praised her as an "indefatigable agitator" for good 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Link laughs at that description. She sees herself as more of an educator than 
an agitator. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why she spends hours studying an issue before carefully rolling typing 
paper, sandwiched around a sheet of carbon paper, into her 45-year-old Royal 
and pecking out "Dear Editor:". 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll try to write that day if I see something that makes me mad enough. I 
rewrite and rewrite to get the nastiness out," she said. "Of course, I don't 
want it to end up too sugary." 
</P>
<P>
 Fat chance of that. A Link letter pulls no punches. They never have. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years she's sounded off on such touchy topics as integration of 
Pasadena schools (she supported it) and the closure of local streets for Rose 
Parade rehearsals (she opposed it). 
</P>
<P>
 She's backed freedom of speech for Angela Davis, linked crime to poverty, 
analyzed the Watergate scandal, pushed for health care reform, panned the 
"disgraceful" neglect of the environment and supported tax reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Link said she writes in hopes of stimulating others to think about a subject. 
Politics is her favorite, she said, because -- like football or baseball -- 
"it's moving all the time. And politicians are very interesting characters. 
They're all actors." 
</P>
<P>
 She spends part of each day doing research at a card table set up in front of 
a television set that is usually tuned to C-SPAN or CNN. She subscribes to two 
daily newspapers and reads a third that is passed along each night by a 
neighbor at her Grand Avenue condominium.  
</P>
<P>
 Government policy papers, mailers from special interest groups and magazines 
pour in. Two years worth of the New Republic and Time magazine are stacked on a 
table in her busy study. 
</P>
<P>
 A cardboard box stuffed with reports and statistical studies sits on a chair. 
A file cabinet jammed with folders full of yellowing newspaper clippings on 
taxes, redevelopment and a hundred other topics stands in the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Her writing is done in her bedroom. The old Royal sits on a rolling stand 
between a French-style desk and a window that opens to a courtyard. Neighbors 
aren't shy about shouting a friendly "Whatcha up to, Clara?" when they hear her 
typewriter clacking away through the window. 
</P>
<P>
 They find out soon enough in the newspaper, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not surprised anymore at what she writes," said Pat Karr, a friend for 
more than 25 years. "She's not a wise guy. She says things simply and plainly 
and to the point. You know exactly what Clara's saying." 
</P>
<P>
 Link keeps a busy schedule of dinners with friends, outings to plays and trips 
to the nearby Ambassador Auditorium "whenever there are any eggheads in town 
speaking." 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Wilson, who has been editorial page editor at the Pasadena Star-News for 
seven years, looks forward to her letters -- and to bumping into her at various 
functions around town. 
</P>
<P>
 "She obviously pores over what she writes. If there's a lot of Wite-out on the 
page she'll write a little note: 'Larry, I was up until 2:30 correcting this 
and I really hope it goes in because this is an important issue,' " Wilson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is really concerned about what she writes about. She always addresses a 
serious subject. . . . Her letters almost always get in." 
</P>
<P>
 Readers call her up asking where she's been if there's an unusual gap between 
her published offerings. Others ask her to tackle a specific issue on their 
behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll say, 'Clara, you have to write a letter about this,' " Link said. "I 
give them my standard speech: I tell them that a letter is just refined 
conversation that's put down on paper. I tell them if you can talk then you can 
write your own letter." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes people call her to complain about what she's written. 
</P>
<P>
 "One guy went through three of my phone message tapes to give me a blistering 
that I was all wrong on abortion and women's right to be a human and decide for 
herself how many children to bear," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others write back. Cardinal Roger M. Mahony, for instance. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahony, then an archbishop, wrote to explain his position in 1990 after Link 
sent a scathing letter to The Times criticizing his lobbying of Catholic 
officeholders to repeal abortion rights legislation. She was responding to a 
newspaper profile of Mahony that had been headlined "The Plugged-In 
Archbishop." 
</P>
<P>
 "If Mahony were 'plugged in' to reality, I believe, he could eventually 
achieve consummate blessedness," Link wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of threatening politicians and consorting with Operation Rescuers, he 
could use his energy and his brilliance to persuade the hierarchy in his own 
church to teach the morality of wanted, healthy, planned-for children by two 
loving, wedded parents who understand the necessity of safe contraception and 
the long-term obligation to child rearing. The Catholic Church could take 
credit for the sharp downward curve in abortion statistics. Archbishop Mahony 
could become Saint Roger." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years Link -- a registered Republican -- has consistently hammered 
away in support of the Equal Rights Amendment, planned parenthood and sex 
education in schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh my, I surprise myself, sometimes," laughed Link -- who admits to sometimes 
cooling off with a glass of rum-laced coconut-banana fruit juice at the end of 
a hot day. 
</P>
<P>
 Link's wide view of the world may have been shaped by her childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 She grew up in the desert hamlet of Luning, Nev., living upstairs at the 
railroad station where her father was the Southern Pacific agent. She attended 
a one-room grade school and Mineral County High School -- which had a total of 
17 students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three out of the four students in my graduating class went on to the 
university," she said. "It's absolutely amazing what you can learn in a small 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 Before moving to Pasadena in 1954, Link worked as a teacher, an oil company 
secretary, a World War II Lockheed aircraft factory safety inspector, a Navy 
industrial relations coordinator and a salary analyst for Paramount Studios. 
</P>
<P>
 Link and her late husband, investment banker Richard M. Link, were raising 
their children Laura and Charles when she began her letter-writing crusade 
almost by accident. 
</P>
<P>
 She had become upset over inroads the ultraconservative John Birch Society was 
making in the Republican Party and was pleased when a newspaper published her 
letter on the subject. Her first real battle involved a proposed school bond 
issue in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Link said she "practically fell off my chair" when she was invited to 
Washington a few weeks ago to receive her Common Cause award. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just a little old lady in Pasadena with an old typewriter. I just like 
blowing off steam and keep doing it instead of reading romance novels," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Common Cause President Fred Wertheimer said Link has helped hold public 
officials' feet to the fire, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "She believes that citizens can make a difference and she goes out and does 
it. In all the years she's been doing this, she has not given up on the 
system," Wertheimer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had a country full of Clara Links, you would not see the kind of 
cynicism and concern about the failure of our system working today that you 
see." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Link, she says her next letter will probably focus on the issue of an 
open election primary in California. Unless, of course, she sees a story in the 
paper that rubs her the wrong way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I might comment on something I read," she cautioned with a grin. Some Link 
Letters A selection of excerpts from Clara Link's letters over the years: 
</P>
<P>
 The summer of 1994 may go down in our cultural history as the summer America 
woke up. We have learned that soccer is an interesting, very athletic game, 
worthy of watching. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching the O.J. hearings we have learned how important our justice system 
is. Perhaps we have learned that spousal abuse is a serious social malady that 
can no longer be tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe we will become convinced that President-bashing and congressional 
gridlock does not result in government of, by and for the people.

<P>
 The Legislature adjourned without appropriating $25 million for mental health, 
leaving Los Angeles County short $7.3 million required to maintain five mental 
health clinics. Restoration of $24 million, cut from the budget by the governor 
for family planning programs, failed to survive trade-off negotiations between 
the governor and the Senate over the governor's work plan for prison inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Did the long hours of pressured lobbying, hundreds of eleventh-hour votes in 
the closing days of the session cause the Senate honorables to lose sight of 
the needs of the mentally ill, of poor women?

 The yearlong ordeal of Edwin Meese III awaiting confirmation to the office of 
attorney general of the United States has ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Standards of ethics and competence for the position were not seriously 
considered in the confirmation process. California's Republican Sen. Pete 
Wilson, citing the independent counsel's finding that there was no basis for 
criminally prosecuting Meese, argues that Meese had done nothing "improper or 
illegal." Democratic Sen. Joe Biden of Delaware responded to Wilson: "We have 
now concluded that if you're not eligible for indictment, you're eligible for 
appointment to the Cabinet of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Pretty strong stuff. What really bothers me about the Meese nomination and 
confirmation is that people who should have been upset weren't.

<P>
 I was amused, amazed and grateful to SenI. Hayakawa (R-Calif.) when I read in 
The Times that the code of ethics adopted by the Senate was "terribly insulting 
to all of us. This is a reaction to the morally arrogant groups who say all 
congressmen are crooks. Those who voted for it were unduly intimidated." 
</P>
<P>
 I was amused at Hayakawa's apparent unwillingness or inability to understand 
that the Senate had earned its reputation for self-serving behavior. All a 
citizen has to do is read the provisions for the code of ethics and do a little 
remembering. I was amazed that the senator, a distinguished semanticist, would 
stoop to demagoguery -- a practice he claims to abhor.

 If men will stop leering at us long enough to listen to us, more and more 
women can and should succeed in political careers. . . . Women have been in 
continuous political training all their lives. When we were young and pretty we 
learned very fast -- as a matter of survival -- to tell a slick proposition 
from a genuine statement. The mature woman has an uncanny ability to sort out 
con artists. This is a great asset to political negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
 Running a city, or county, state or nation is not much different than rearing 
a family. The secret is facing up to problems and never giving up.

STATE SWEEP TARGETS QUAKE-REPAIR CRIME; LAW ENFORCEMENT: TASK FORCE VISITS 
NUMEROUS VALLEY HOMES, FINDING UNLICENSED CONTRACTORS AND LABOR VIOLATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOCELYN Y. STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 The workers repairing a quake-damaged Woodland Hills house stood next to a 
cement-filled wheelbarrow, shovels and trowels in hand, and stared 
uncomprehendingly at the state official telling the contractor: 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears you have committed a crime." 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you mean, a crime?" the contractor asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a felony to do what you're doing," said Ken Johnson, a deputy registrar 
with the Contractors State License Board. He explained that the law required 
him to have a contractor's license as well as workers' compensation insurance 
for his employees, which he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to go call somebody," the contractor said before getting in his car 
and driving off, leaving his workers to fend for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Welcome to the world of contracting," Johnson said as he waited for police to 
arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was part of a multi-agency task force that conducted a sweep Wednesday 
through quake-damaged neighborhoods, mostly in Sherman Oaks, searching for 
unlicensed contractors and licensed contractors in violation of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine individuals were cited for functioning as contractors without a license, 
which carries a fine of $1,500 to $2,000, and 15 licensed contractors were 
cited for violations ranging from lack of workers' compensation insurance to 
having an expired license, which carry fines ranging from $500 to $4,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Armed only with cellular phones, members of the task force made random stops 
at work sites, issuing warnings and citations to offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't solve the problem, but these are people, unlicensed and licensed, 
that (otherwise) may never have been caught," said Mike T. Camplin, deputy 
registrar with the contractors board. "Only (because) we're out there and 
questioning these people do these violations come to light." 
</P>
<P>
 The sweep was one of many conducted by the board's inspectors in quake-damaged 
neighborhoods since Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding violators is no easy task. Sometimes it involves a bit of detective 
work -- violators are photographed and victims of construction scams are 
sometimes shown photo lineups of past violators to identify suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 And sometimes there are brushes with danger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a contractor who threatened to kill me the next time he saw me," 
Johnson said. "People get hostile out here."  
</P>
<P>
 In what has evolved into a running battle since the quake created a mass 
market for home repair work, there are also small victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's sweep began at about 8 a.m. as representatives of three state 
agencies gathered in the parking lot of a Riverside Drive mini-mall in Sherman 
Oaks to receive their assignments. Like police officers on undercover 
operations, they wore casual clothes that belie their titles -- a necessity, 
given the work they do. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we do is not for three-piece suits," Camplin said, standing in the 
parking lot. "Sometimes we have to scam these guys. We don't exactly lie, we 
just don't tell them the whole truth, to find out who the contractor is and 
what's going on." 
</P>
<P>
 The Contractors State License Board is not the only agency interested in 
finding unlicensed contractors and licensed violators. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Employment Development Department want to talk to them, too. 
Their goal was different: to find unregistered employers who are paying workers 
in cash and not paying taxes, said Bill Jenkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Also along were inspectors for the state Labor Commission, looking for 
labor-law violations. 
</P>
<P>
 After a briefing in the parking lot, 12 investigators fanned out into Sherman 
Oaks, staying in contact by cellular phones. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators such as Johnson see the world through trained eyes. Driving 
along the freeway, he spotted a truck owned by a sandblasting company and 
called his office to determine if the truck belongs to a contractor he had 
cited before. 
</P>
<P>
 Each house he passes with a pile of rubble or bricks in front -- a sign of 
repair work -- is a potential crime scene, and hard for Johnson to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you get started, it's like eating peanuts," he said, as he left one 
damaged house and walked toward a red brick house with a pile of bricks in the 
driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the six investigators with the contractors board made 68 stops during 
the sweep. In most interviews, contractors presented their licenses willingly 
and cooperated. 
</P>
<P>
 Contractor Wilhelm Braun, building a chimney at a house on Buffalo Avenue, 
made no complaint about showing his contractor's identification card to 
Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything checked out fine," Johnson said, after calling his office to see 
if the license was valid or if there were any other problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Braun welcomed the sweep. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad you guys are doing it because the guys that don't have a license are 
taking a lot of money out of our pockets," Braun said. He's been a contractor 
for 20 years, he said, and he resents unlicensed competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the house in Woodland Hills, Johnson was far from welcome.  
</P>
<P>
 Battling language barriers -- the workers spoke Spanish and Tongan -- Johnson 
tried to explain the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers became belligerent and refused to give him their identification. 
</P>
<P>
 Caught in the middle was homeowner Charles Gomes, who thought he had taken 
enough precautions to avoid such problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Before signing the contract, Gomes called the automated contractors board 
telephone line to determine if the contractors' license number on the contract 
was valid. It was, but it did not belong to the man who signed the contract, 
Johnson said. And the recording does not tell callers if the contractor has 
workers' comp coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson had issued a citation to one of the workers at Gomes' house last week 
for unlicensed contractor activity, but by that point workers had torn off the 
roof of Gomes' house and he felt he had no choice but to continue with the same 
contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a bare roof and two block walls torn down," a frustrated Gomes said. 
"I'm not going to stop the job. If it rains on me, I'm dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Wilton Mays of the Los Angeles Police Department and his partner -- 
who showed up in response to a call from Johnson -- calmed the angry workers 
and assisted Johnson in getting the workers' names and taking photographs of 
them for contractors board records. 
</P>
<P>
 For Johnson, who remained calm throughout the incident, the encounter was just 
another day in the quake-repair zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hear all kinds of stories," he said. "You see all kinds of things. It 
makes you feel good when you can help people. . . . Sometimes you can help them 
but not as much as they would like."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: BRENTWOOD; BRAUDE 
OFFERS STEPS TO EASE TRAFFIC NEAR SIMPSON ESTATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trying to stem the curiosity seekers still flocking to O.J. Simpson's 
Brentwood estate, Councilman Marvin Braude has proposed two measures that would 
ease traffic and parking congestion on North Rockingham Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Braude urged the Police Department to close the street to through traffic and 
proposed a preferential parking district in the area to limit parking to 
residents with special stickers.The measures, which come as Simpson awaits 
trial in the double murder, will be considered by the City Council on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who live on and around Rockingham Road in Brentwood Park are, in a 
very real sense, also victims of this tragic murder case," Braude said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Through no fault of their own, Brentwood Park residents now find their 
streets jammed with cars driven by curiosity seekers from all over, who want to 
see, touch and have their pictures taken in front of a site that has become 
known the world over."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: JUDGE UPHOLDS CITY 
APPROVAL OF PLAYA VISTA PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATHIS CHAZANOV 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Effectively removing the last legal obstacle to what could eventually become 
the largest development project in the city's history, a Superior Court judge 
has found that Los Angeles authorities acted properly when they approved an 
environmental impact report for the Playa Vista development near Marina del 
Ray. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents had argued that the report failed to disclose the cumulative effects 
the project would have on traffic, air pollution and water quality.They also 
said that officials erred by approving the first phase of the project before a 
master plan was in place. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a ruling Tuesday, Judge David Rothman found that the city followed the 
California Environmental Quality Act in approving the 14,000-page document, 
which he found to be "daunting but not impenetrable."  
</P>
<P>
 The first phase would include more than 3,000 residential units, 1.25 million 
square feet of office space, 35,000 square feet of retail space and 300 hotel 
rooms. The $7-billion project would eventually grow to the size of Hermosa 
Beach, with its own marina. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathy Knight, treasurer of Save Ballona Wetlands, an ad hoc group that 
challenged the report in court after the City Council approved it last fall, 
said it was too early to comment on the judge's ruling, "but we still have the 
same concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Gardner, project manager for Playa Vista and a vice president of 
developer Maguire Thomas Partners, said the decision "vindicates the hard work 
that we and the city of Los Angeles put into the environmental documentation." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of an earlier lawsuit, the developer is required to restore 
and preserve the 270-acre Ballona Wetlands on the property. MATHIS CHAZANOV

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: FIGHTING RABIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles is offering clinics through September at which dogs 
can receive anti-rabies vaccinations for $4. Dog licenses may also be available 
at some of the clinics, sponsored by the Department of Animal 
Regulation.Licenses cost $20 for unsterilized dogs and $10 for sterilized dogs. 
Proof of sterilization is required. California law requires that all dogs over 
the age of 4 months be inoculated against rabies. The city cannot grant a dog 
license without a current vaccination certificate. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinics will be held in recreation center parking lots and will offer optional 
vaccinations against common canine diseases.  
</P>
<P>
 Dog owners should not feed or provide water to their pets for five to six 
hours before the vaccinations, and should use a collar and leash. Clinic 
information may be obtained 24 hours a day at (213) 893-8566.

 "Wasn't there water up here?" asked LaVette Thomas, as she and nearly 30 other 
girls from the Watts area hiked in 90-plus degree weather past the dried-up Red 
Canyon Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 As members of "Sista 2 Sista," a social and recreation program that teaches 
confidence and communication skills to inner-city youths, the girls embarked on 
an all-day hike and played outdoor games in Red Rock Canyon Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Called "LA WILD Challenge," the day was coordinated by the Mountains 
Conservancy Foundation and organized by both the Watts Friendship Sports League 
and People for Parks, co-sponsors of "Sista 2 Sista." The girls learned 
team-building, communication and leadership skills in the mountain setting. 
</P>
<P>
 The games heavily emphasized trust and group interaction. The game "People to 
People" helped the girls, many from different neighborhoods, get to know each 
other. Standing face to face with a random partner, touching foreheads or 
limbs, the girls switched partners, in a musical-chairs fashion, whenever the

 One game called for two girls -- one blindfolded -- to walk on a cable 
suspended above the ground while holding on to the same rope running through a 
pulley overhead. The goal was for the blind girl to trust both her partner and 
the several "spotters" positioned nearby to help her stay balanced.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: HOLLYWOOD; REPORT ASKED 
ON ALL DAMAGE FROM SUBWAY CONSTRUCTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 County Supervisor Mike Antonovich Wednesday asked for a report of all damage 
caused by Metro Rail subway construction from Union Station to Hollywood, 
including a cost estimate for curing the economic and physical impacts of the 
massive project. 
</P>
<P>
 The request was made by Antonovich during a meeting of the Metropolitan 
Transportation Board, on which he serves.It came six days after tunneling was 
shut down because a section of Hollywood Boulevard sank up to nine inches, 
buckling the Walk of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 "A pattern of construction difficulties beginning from Union Station, where 
undetected high ground water tables impeded construction . . . to the discovery 
of hydrogen sulfide and methane gas in the Mid-City area raise questions about 
whether planning and oversight have been properly managed," said Antonovich, 
who favors construction of a monorail instead of a subway through the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Sieroty, a former state senator who owns property along Hollywood 
Boulevard, urged the MTA board, "Don't let the administrators sweep this under 
the rug as just another little thing. . . . It really bothers me that you don't 
take responsibility for what you did."  
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials believe the sinking was caused by loosely packed, sandy soil and 
leaking water pipes. They say they have yet to determine the cause of the water 
leaks, but said they may have been caused by Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Leron Gubler, general manager of the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce, called for 
an independent investigation by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an international cultural resource," he said, citing news reports 
about the damage from as far away as Paris.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: MONTCLAIR; MOUNTAIN 
LION SHOT BY POLICE AT SHOPPING CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police shot and killed a 2 1/2-year-old mountain lion at the Montclair Plaza 
shopping center Monday night after three attempts to tranquilize the 65-pound 
animal failed and it advanced toward police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven rounds were fired at the animal by the four officers and a supervisor 
who responded to the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our fullest intent was to get the animal tranquilized, sedated and back into 
the mountains," said Montclair Police Lt. Terry Gibson.  
</P>
<P>
 Gibson said security officers at the plaza noticed the lion lounging near the 
loading dock of the J.C. Penney store at the Montclair Plaza at about 11:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 A biologist from the state Department of Fish and Game and a volunteer from 
the Wildlife Waystation were called to the scene. Each fired a tranquilizer 
dart, both of which missed the animal, Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
 A third dart hit the lion in its upper hind quarters, said Bob Schlichting, 
spokesman for the state Department of Fish and Game. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the tranquilizer could take effect, the lion began pacing in the 
loading bay and then paused and moved toward the officers, Schlichting said. 
The officers flickered their lights and made noise to try to scare the animal 
back into the dock. When it came within 10 feet of one of the officers they 
fired, Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The carcass was removed from the scene by the Humane Society. Fish and Game 
officials believe the animal came down from the nearby mountains.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; NIGHTCLUB 
BOUNCER CLEARED IN SHOOTING DEATHS OF 2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A nightclub bouncer was acquitted of murder Wednesday in the deaths of two men 
he shot outside the Blak and Bloo club in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Roman Paul Luisi, 24, said he shot Eric Pierce, 25, and Adrian 
Thames, 23, in self-defense because he feared that the men -- patrons he had 
thrown out of the nightspot a short time earlier -- had returned to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the trouble at the now-closed Blak and Bloo began about 2 a.m. on 
Nov. 30, 1992, when Luisi ordered Pierce and Thames to leave the club after 
they had argued with other men. 
</P>
<P>
 When Pierce, Thames and a friend, Andre Murphy, returned to the club a short 
time later, Luisi burst out the door, shouted something and opened fire, 
according to Murphy's testimony at a hearing in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Alan Carter said Luisi thought of himself as Rambo, but 
Luisi's attorney, Leslie Abramson, said her client was simply reacting to fears 
that the three men intended to kill him. Luisi testified that he thought Pierce 
had a pistol, but no gun was ever recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Thames' mother, Janie Thames, expressed disappointment after the verdict, 
saying her family feels "as though we were let down by the justice system."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; ALARCON 
SEEKS SPECIAL PATROLS FOR 'GHOST TOWNS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reacting to complaints that unarmed guards hired by the city cannot protect 
San Fernando Valley "ghost towns" -- apartment buildings left vacant by quake 
damage -- Councilman Richard Alarcon called Wednesday for special police 
patrols to rid the buildings of drug dealers, gang members and vandals. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter faxed late Wednesday to Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. 
Williams, Alarcon also asked the department to take an official position on 
using federal disaster relief funds to hire armed guards.The patrols are 
currently unarmed, partly because local police officials have warned that 
hiring guards with guns could lead to violent confrontations and subsequent 
lawsuits against the city. 
</P>
<P>
 A LAPD spokesman said Williams was not prepared to comment on Alarcon's 
request. But police officials in the San Fernando Valley said they will 
recommend that Williams reject Alarcon's request. The matter is scheduled to be 
discussed by the city's Ad Hoc Earthquake Committee on Sept. 13.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN FERNANDO VALLEY; 
COMPLETION OF SIMI FREEWAY REPAIRS PUT OFF TO SEPT. 19 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a setback for northern San Fernando Valley commuters, reconstruction of the 
earthquake-damaged Simi Valley Freeway -- originally scheduled for completion 
next week -- will not be finished until Sept. 19, according to Caltrans. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials had expected to reopen all lanes of the bridges at San Fernando 
Mission Boulevard and Bull Creek next Tuesday after workers finished repairing 
the westbound side of the spans, which were considerably weakened in the 
Northridge earthquake.But a delay in starting the project and last-minute 
design changes pushed back the targeted completion date. 
</P>
<P>
 After the January temblor, the overpasses sagged nearly four feet in some 
spots. To handle traffic in the area, which currently averages about 180,000 
vehicles daily, workers erected a detour that funneled traffic from both 
directions into the five lanes that used to carry only westbound traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 If construction is completed by Sept. 19, the three lanes of westbound traffic 
will be routed onto the new bridge immediately. But a full reopening of all 10 
lanes of the freeway could take another 20 days, as originally planned.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CITIZENS TO ADVISE ON CRA'S RECOVERY ROLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the latest effort to quell nervousness over the City Redevelopment Agency 
joining earthquake recovery efforts, City Councilman Hal Bernson has convened a 
20-member citizen committee to make recommendations on how and where the agency 
should be involved. 
</P>
<P>
 City plans call for the CRA -- operating under disaster provisions of the 
state redevelopment law -- to use property taxes in certain districts to pay 
for quake-related improvements, a method known as tax-increment financing.  
</P>
<P>
 Bernson's panel, which has met twice, will submit recommendations to the City 
Council on what should be the role of the CRA. 
</P>
<P>
 The Council is scheduled to vote on a plan in October. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a public perception problem with the CRA," said Greig Smith, 
Bernson's chief of staff, and so Bernson is being "very cautious" and seeking 
input from a committee made up of CRA supporters, detractors and relatively 
unbiased community members. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Zev Yaroslavsky and Laura Chick have been holding public 
meetings on the topic for similar reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to take the temperature of the public to see how they react," 
Yaroslavsky said earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The CRA has taken considerable heat -- and even death threats -- over both the 
tax-increment financing of its operation and its use of eminent domain powers 
during past projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Those powers allow the agency to condemn private land in redevelopment areas 
to make way for improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Prince, longtime CRA critic and a member of Bernson's committee, said, 
"What you can't do is let them take over the whole community." 
</P>
<P>
 John Spalding, director of policy planning at the CRA, pointed out that under 
the disaster provisions of redevelopment laws, the agency can condemn private 
property only in cases of abandonment or extreme disrepair. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not typical redevelopment plans," he said of those being studied for 
earthquake recovery. "We're not there to make major changes in the 
neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 While Bernson's committee debates and other Valley council members hold 
hearings, the CRA is not hammering out its plan behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials currently are discussing proposals with community leaders, Spalding 
said, and the agency plans to hold its own public meetings beginning in 
September. ERIC SLATER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; CITY TO RULE ON POLE SIGN CODE VIOLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city must decide whether a service station near the freeway may keep a 
pole sign that does not conform to code -- possibly touching off a replay of a 
controversy in Agoura Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the first times we've had a major sign issue come before us," 
said Dave Brown, a member of the Calabasas Planning Commission. "This could be 
the beginning of a controversy over here." 
</P>
<P>
 The commission will vote today whether to allow the Mobil service station on 
Calabasas Road to keep a 100-foot pole sign that was installed by the 
building's previous occupant, an Exxon service station. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County approved the Exxon station's application for the sign in 
1972, but Calabasas, which incorporated in 1991, prohibits signs higher than 60 
feet, said Assistant Planner Barbara Pilegard.  
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas based its code on the county's, she said, which raises questions 
about how Exxon was able to win approval for the sign. 
</P>
<P>
 City planners recommend that the station, located at 24025 Calabasas Road, be 
allowed to keep the sign for seven years to give the station time to comply, 
Pilegard said. After that the sign must be taken down. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange the city is willing to allow the applicant to keep another sign 
that also does not conform to code, a 22-foot twin-pole, she said. That sign 
apparently was installed without any permits whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gone through the building permits, but there is no building permit for a 
22-foot sign," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura Hills outlawed pole signs nine years ago, saying they spoil the view of 
nearby foothills. Merchants were given seven years to remove existing ones. 
Voters in November backed the sign ban by a 3-1 ratio. 
</P>
<P>
 But many business owners have balked at removing the signs, saying they need 
them to attract customers driving by on the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten businesses -- Chevron, Unocal, McDonald's, Texaco, Burger King, Denny's, 
Jack-in-the-Box, Lumber City, Roadside Lumber and Fence Factory -- filed 
separate lawsuits against the city in May, charging that the ban on the signs 
will hurt their profits. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, a community group in Agoura Hills led a boycott against the 
businesses. But some of the businesses declared the boycott a failure and vowed 
to continue their fight to keep the signs. FRANK MANNING

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: COUNCIL TO RECONSIDER QUAKE REPAIR FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bowing to pressure from San Fernando Valley representatives, the Los Angeles 
City Council on Wednesday unanimously agreed without discussion to reconsider 
spending more money to repair and replace housing in quake-damaged areas.  
</P>
<P>
 The council is scheduled to take a second vote Tuesday on how to divide $47 
million it amassed from the sale of bonds for affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, with three Valley council members absent, the council deadlocked on 
a proposal to spend $23 million of the money to repair and replace housing 
damaged by the Jan. 17 Northridge quake.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the council voted to allocate only $14.7 million for quake-damaged 
areas -- or $8.3 million less than the proposal backed by Valley 
representatives. The council also designated $14 million for areas damaged by 
the 1992 riots and $18 million for citywide use.  
</P>
<P>
 Valley Councilmen Richard Alarcon and Zev Yaroslavsky successfully pressed for 
another vote, arguing that it was a violation of protocol for Councilman Mark 
Ridley-Thomas to bring the matter up in the absence of Yaroslavsky and 
Councilmen Joel Wachs and Hal Bernson. Ridley-Thomas, who has denied that he 
intended to take advantage of their absence, co-sponsored the motion for 
reconsideration, but was not present when it was put to a vote Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Yaroslavsky and Alarcon contend that more funds should be allocated to the 
quake zones, where 25,000 housing units were damaged, because federal quake aid 
will leave the city at least $200 million short of funds for housing. Their 
plan calls for the council to allocate only $10 million to citywide housing.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; AIR SHOW ATTENDANCE AND FUNDS DROP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pinched pocketbooks may have contributed to a drop in attendance and funds 
raised for charity at this year's Van Nuys Airport Expo, airport officials said 
Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 About 230,000 people attended the two-day event Saturday and Sunday, compared 
with 250,000 last year, said spokesperson Stacey Geere.Concession sales for 
local nonprofit groups also dropped from about $45,000 in 1993 to $30,300 this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how to explain it," Geere said. "Maybe people spent less money 
with the earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 The show featured dozens of vintage military aircraft on display, as well as 
sky-diving performances by the Army's Golden Knights parachute team and 
helicopter rescue demonstrations by the Los Angeles Fire Department. The event 
was co-hosted by the Van Nuys Department of Airports and the Mid-San Fernando 
Valley Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 About 23 charities will still benefit from the show, including local Kiwanis 
and Rotary clubs and high school booster clubs, Geere said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just pleased that the nonprofits were able to make money as in the past 
and will be able to use part of the money to recover from past earthquake 
losses," Geere said. JEFF SCHNAUFER

QUAKE AREA SWEEP CITES 9 UNLICENSED CONTRACTORS; RECOVERY: INVESTIGATORS FAN 
OUT FOR THE DAY, MOSTLY IN SHERMAN OAKS, LOOKING FOR RUBBLE OR OTHER SIGNS THAT 
BUILDING IS GOING ON. AT ONE STOP WORKERS ARE UNWILLING TO SHOW IDENTIFICATION 
AND POLICE ARE CALLED.

 The workers repairing a quake-damaged Woodland Hills house stood next to a 
concrete-filled wheelbarrow, shovels and trowels in hand, and stared 
uncomprehendingly at the state official. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears you have committed a crime," the official said to the contractor 
who employed the men. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you mean, a crime?" the contractor asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a felony to do what you're doing," said Ken Johnson, a deputy registrar 
with the Contractors State License Board. Jonson explained that the law 
requires a contractor's license as well as workers' compensation insurance for 
employees, which the contractor did not have. 
</P>
<P>
 "Welcome to the world of contracting," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was part of a multi-agency task force conducting a sweep Wednesday 
through quake-damaged neighborhoods, mostly in Sherman Oaks, searching for 
unlicensed contractors and licensed ones in violation of the contracting laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine people were cited for functioning as contractors without a license, which 
carries a fine of $1,500 to $2,000, and 15 licensed contractors were cited for 
violations ranging from lack of workers' compensation insurance to having an 
expired license, which carry a fine of $500 to $4,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators from the Employment Development Department and the state Labor 
Commission also were part of the task force conducting the sweep. The EDD's 
goal is to find unregistered employers who are paying workers in cash -- and 
not paying taxes, officials said. And the Labor Commission is looking for labor 
law violators. 
</P>
<P>
 After a briefing in a parking lot, 12 investigators fanned out into Sherman 
Oaks, keeping contact on cellular phones. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said he sees each house he passes with a pile of rubble or bricks in 
front -- a sign of repair work -- as a potential crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the six investigators with the contractors board made 68 stops during 
the sweep. In most interviews, contractors willingly presented their licenses 
and cooperated. But at the house in Woodland Hills, Johnson was far from 
welcome. Battling language barriers -- the workers spoke Spanish and Tongan -- 
Johnson tried to explain his mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers became belligerent and refused to show him identification. 
</P>
<P>
 Caught in the middle was homeowner Charles Gomes. Before signing a contract, 
Gomes had called the automated contractors board telephone line to determine if 
the contractor's license number on the contract was valid. It was, but it 
turned out not belong to the man who signed the contract, Johnson said. And the 
recording does not tell callers if the contractor has workers' compensation 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police who showed up in response to a call for help by Johnson 
calmed the angry workers and assisted Johnson in getting the workers' names and 
in taking photographs of them for contractors board records. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson had issued a citation to one of the workers at Gomes' house last week 
for unlicensed contracting. But by that point workers had torn off the roof of 
the home and Gomes felt he had no choice but to continue with the same workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a bare roof and two block walls torn down," a frustrated Gomes said. 
"I'm not going to stop the job. If it rains on me, I'm dead." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said violations of the law are the contractor's problem, not an 
unwitting homeowner's.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PANORAMA CITY; GOODWILL HELPS DISABLED ENTER JOB MARKET

 Through the Deaf Services Program, Shell Moore learned to communicate in a 
whole new language: DOS. 
</P>
<P>
 Having recently lost her hearing, Moore moved from Ventura to Encino so she 
could participate in the Goodwill Industries program, which offers computer 
classes and job placement for the deaf. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before I took the classes, I was scared. Now, I am willing," said Moore, who 
has landed a job as a film and video editor because of her computer skills. 
</P>
<P>
 At its San Fernando Valley facility in Panorama City, Goodwill provides 
training in clerical work, data entry and computer programming for deaf and 
developmentally disabled people and later helps them with job placement or 
hires them to work as Goodwill employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than 90% of the jobs advertised will want someone to fill in as a phone 
operator or a receptionist," said Joe Bates, a deaf interpreter and employment 
specialist with the program, illustrating the difficulty the deaf experience 
when looking for a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Gough, the coordinator of the Deaf Services Program, said there are 
many barriers for the deaf and hard-of-hearing in the job market, such as 
employers not having the appropriate equipment or awareness. But with 
incentives to hire the disabled, such as tax breaks for the company, more 
businesses are looking for deaf employees. 
</P>
<P>
 For the developmentally disabled, Goodwill offers a basic program where its 
clients are taught to sort and mend donated items that will be sold in thrift 
stores. In addition to the training program, 20 sheltered employees (people not 
suited for jobs in the mainstream work force) work at the Panorama City 
location. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Los Angeles, Goodwill provides training and some employment in the 
areas of truck driving, janitorial skills and retail sales, according to 
Goodwill's director of community relations, Rholan Wong. MAKI BECKER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; ENROLLMENT GROWTH SUBSIDING THIS YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A decade-long trend of rapid enrollment growth in the Glendale Unified School 
District is subsiding, district officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary enrollment report for the 1994-95 school year that was presented 
to the school board Tuesday night shows a drop of about 170 students from the 
9,554 students last year at Glendale's nine elementary schools operating on a 
year-round basis.  
</P>
<P>
 A report for the entire district -- which also includes 10 other elementary 
schools that run on a traditional calendar, plus the four middle and four high 
schools -- won't be completed until after school starts Sept. 8. But officials 
say the early numbers show that the steady influx of students into the district 
from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s is over. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back in 1984, the district had 19,900 students," district spokesman Vic 
Pallos said. "Since that time we have been growing anywhere from 3% to 5% a 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 But for the upcoming school year, the district expects an overall increase in 
the student population of only about 1% over last year. Officials said they 
expect the student population to "top out" at about 29,000 during the 1995-96 
school year, and then remain relatively stable or begin to drop as the students 
who entered the district during its growth spurt graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 The change in the once-homogenous district's ethnic makeup over the past 10 
years was caused my massive immigration by families of Armenian ancestry into 
Glendale from Lebanon, Iran, Iraq, Russia and other countries, plus increases 
in the number of Latino, Asian and Filipino students, said Greg Bowman, 
director of instruction and student services. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, 60% of the students in Glendale schools speak a primary language other 
than English. In all, the students speak an estimated 67 different languages at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The entire city has had to deal with this tremendous influx. It tested our 
capacity to deal with an inundation of families who didn't speak English, but I 
think the schools have had to deal with it more quickly and responsively than 
any other agency," Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest evidence of the district's efforts to accommodate the student surge 
of the 1980s is a new four-story, 40-classroom building at Glendale High 
School, which will open in September, 1995.  
</P>
<P>
 The district has also added classrooms at Hoover High, Roosevelt Middle School 
and several elementary schools, and established programs like the American 
Culture Class and the Welcome Center for immigrant families and students. STEVE

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; CLOTHING INTENDED FOR POOR YOUTHS IS STOLEN

 After spending all summer gathering clothes for poor children to wear to 
school, a Valley charity is facing the start of the academic year with its 
racks nearly bare. 
</P>
<P>
 A break-in at its Van Nuys headquarters last week has left the Volunteer 
League of the San Fernando Valley with not nearly enough clothes to outfit the 
2,000 children it assists every year. 
</P>
<P>
 Thieves broke a window of the charity's headquarters -- a two-story house on 
Hamlin Street -- on Aug. 15 and stole about $7,000 worth of clothing and 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxes of new jeans, jackets and shoes were taken, in addition to computers, a 
fax machine, an answering machine and all of the organization's records that 
were stored on disks and in the computers. The league has insurance, but 
President Eileen Fewless said she worries that the reimbursements will not 
arrive in time to buy new clothes before the school year begins. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what it's going to do to us," Fewless said. "It's going to be 
like we are starting from scratch." 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1952, the organization provides two complete outfits, including 
jeans, shoes and jackets, to schoolchildren from low-income families who are 
referred by school counselors and social workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just so frustrating when you are working in the community and want to do 
something good, and you know when they come you are not going to be ready for 
them," Fewless said. "That's what breaks our hearts the most." For more 
information about the charity, call (818) 785-4134. SUSAN BYRNES

 A fire at a Glendale self-storage business Tuesday night destroyed an old 
piano, an ice chest and some other items, but firefighters said the blaze could 
have been far worse if not for a sprinkler system. 
</P>
<P>
 Battalion Chief Mike Carter said fire officials were baffled as to what caused 
the 8:30 p.m. fire at Rene's Van and Storage, 6527 San Fernando Road. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't found a logical reason for the fire to start," Carter said. "We're 
not able to identify a source of ignition." 
</P>
<P>
 The 32,000-square-foot warehouse had closed for business at 4 p.m. and was 
empty when the fire was reported, Carter said. Five wooden storage vaults were 
destroyed and several others damaged, but sprinklers kept the fire from 
spreading to other vaults and from damaging the building itself, Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This could have been a much bigger disaster in terms of property loss," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arson was not strongly suspected in the fire because the items stored in the 
vaults were not particularly valuable, fire officials said. STEVE RYFLE

BOYFRIEND GETS 4 MONTHS IN WOMAN'S BEATING 
</P>

<P>
 A Panorama City man was sentenced to four months in jail for the Christmas Day 
beating of his girlfriend, who was forcibly brought to court by a sheriff's 
deputy because she ignored a subpoena to appear to testify, city prosecutors 
said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Williams, 25, a reputed member of a Venice-based street gang, changed 
his plea from not guilty to no contest to one count of spousal battery Tuesday 
when he saw the victim escorted into court, according to a statement issued by 
the Los Angeles city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams attacked the 22-year-old victim at the couple's home on Christmas 
Day, beating her with his fists and then threatening her with a knife, the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police officers who responded to a call for help saw scratches on 
the woman's face and swelling and bruises on her forehead, the statement said.  
</P>
<P>
 Williams fled but was arrested in the Oakwood section of Venice on July 17, 
the city attorney's office said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman cooperated with authorities until she failed to appear to testify on 
the first day of Williams' trial Aug. 11, the statement said. Prosecutor Debra 
Siedorf then obtained an order to have the woman forcibly brought into court. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Municipal Judge Harold Crowder ordered Williams to begin serving the 
jail sentence immediately, plus three years probation. Williams also must 
complete six months of domestic violence counseling and refrain from annoying, 
harassing or threatening the victim. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar 1991 domestic violence case against Williams was dismissed by a West 
Los Angeles Municipal Court judge after the victim, who lived with Williams, 
refused to appear for the trial and could not be located by authorities, the 
city attorney's office said.

FATHER OF BOY WHO DIED IN CRASH TO FACE MURDER TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A North Hollywood man was ordered Wednesday to stand trial on a charge of 
second-degree murder for allegedly killing his 5-year-old son while driving 
drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedro Guzman, 34, is also charged with injuring another person while driving 
drunk and driving with a blood alcohol level of over .08. The charges stem from 
a May 7 accident at Riverton Avenue and Arminta Street that took the life of 
his son, William. 
</P>
<P>
 At a preliminary hearing in Van Nuys Municipal Court, police testified that 
witnesses indicated that Guzman had been drinking at his house before he and a 
friend took his son on a beer run. 
</P>
<P>
 William Guzman, who was not wearing a seat belt, died of massive head injuries 
when his father's car collided with an auto driven by Gilbert Ramirez, 24, of 
Sun Valley, who was subsequently convicted of vehicular manslaughter and also 
of drunk driving.  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Department Officer Ronald A. Vega testified that when he 
arrived at the site of the 6:30 p.m. crash, he found "a small bundle of 
blankets just behind a tree. Underneath . . . was a small child who had met his 
demise." 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses testified that Guzman picked up his son from the rear seat of the 
car and cried, "I've killed my son, I've killed my son." Witnesses persuaded 
him to lay the child on the grass so CPR could be performed, but it was too 
late. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors said Guzman, who had two drunk driving convictions, knew the 
consequences of driving under the influence because he had attended drunk 
drivers school as part of his sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he knew what would happen if you drink and drive," said Vega about 
his initial interview with Guzman. Guzman also was driving with a suspended 
license, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Horgan, who has lived with the Guzmans for the last three years, said 
that before Guzman left to get more beer and a bottle of whiskey that day, he 
could tell Guzman was intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked him if he was all right to drive and he said he was OK," Horgan said. 
"I picked (William) up and tickled him. He said, 'Let me go, let me go.' That 
was the last time I ever saw Willie." 
</P>
<P>
 Guzman is being held in lieu of $1 million bail. He is scheduled to appear in 
Superior Court Sept. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted of second-degree murder, Guzman faces a maximum sentence of life 
in state prison.

ALARCON SEEKS SPECIAL POLICE PATROLS TO RID 'GHOST TOWNS' OF VICE; SAFETY: THE 
COUNCILMAN ALSO ASKS FOR AN OFFICIAL STANCE ON SPENDING DISASTER RELIEF FUNDS 
TO HIRE ARMED GUARDS AT THE BUILDINGS. 
</P>

<P>
 Reacting to complaints that unarmed guards hired by the city can't protect San 
Fernando Valley "ghost towns" -- apartment buildings left vacant by quake 
damage -- Councilman Richard Alarcon on Wednesday called for special police 
patrols to rid the buildings of drug dealers, gang members and vandals. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter faxed late Wednesday to Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. 
Williams, Alarcon also asked the department to take an official position on 
using federal disaster relief funds to hire armed guards. The patrols are now 
unarmed, partly because local police officials have warned that hiring guards 
with guns could lead to violent confrontations and subsequent lawsuits against 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 An LAPD spokesman said Williams was not prepared to comment on Alarcon's 
request. But police officials in the San Fernando Valley said they will 
recommend that Williams reject Alarcon's request for special patrols in the 
northeast Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not in favor of it," said Cmdr. John Moran of the Valley Bureau. "We just 
don't have the people. Let's assume you gave the public a choice -- fight 
violent crime or protect the ghost towns. Most people would choose to fight 
violent crime."  
</P>
<P>
 Alarcon, who flew to Washington before his proposal was announced by staff 
members, could not be reached for comment. The matter is scheduled to be 
discussed by the city's Ad Hoc Earthquake Committee on Sept. 13.  
</P>
<P>
 Several council members said they wanted to study Alarcon's proposal before 
commenting. But Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, whose district includes heavily 
damaged areas of Sherman Oaks, said that although he has not received any 
complaints about guards at "ghost towns" in Sherman Oaks, there may be a need 
to arm them in North Hills if problems are worse there.  
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a significant escalation, but it may be necessary," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the Northridge quake created 12 clusters of uninhabited apartment 
buildings in the Valley, Hollywood and the mid-city area, some nearby residents 
have complained about problems ranging from squatters barbecuing inside 
abandoned units to prostitutes and drug dealers setting up shop in the parking 
lots. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency granted $2.8 million to the city to 
board up, fence off and protect the "ghost towns." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, a North Hills citizens group sharply criticized a security 
company hired by the city to protect 41 abandoned apartment buildings east of 
the San Diego Freeway between Roscoe and Nordhoff boulevards. One member of the 
North Hills Task Force said Wednesday that the two guards, provided by 
Alhambra-based Inter-Con Security Systems, are useless because their lack of 
weapons makes them reluctant to stand up to interlopers.  
</P>
<P>
 "They would carry much more authority if they were armed," said Eddie 
Gonzalez, a North Hills property manager and member of the task force. 
</P>
<P>
 The group supports Alarcon's proposal, said property manager Guy Stadig, 
adding that more police are necessary because "the area is just wild with 
crime." 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD does not keep statistics on crimes committed in the "ghost towns." 
But some police statistics suggest that while vandalism, prostitution and drug 
sales may be increasing, the number of other offenses may actually be dropping 
in the North Hills area east of the San Diego Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of arrests for major crimes, including rape, robbery and homicide, 
actually declined about 30% in the area for the first seven months of this year 
compared to the same period the year before, from about 1,450 arrests to about 
962, said Capt. Vance Proctor, commanding officer of the Devonshire division. 
He credited the reduction in arrests to an increased police presence. 
</P>
<P>
 Proctor said he has been spending at least 80% of his overtime budget -- or 
more than $77,000 per month -- on extra patrols for the North Hills "ghost 
town" since the quake.  
</P>
<P>
 "If the powers that be want to give me additional resources for the ghost 
towns, I'll say thank you very much," Proctor said. "But at this point, 
Devonshire has nothing left to give."

COUPLE HELD ON SUSPICION OF RELIEF FUNDS FRAUD; CRIME: THE TWO ALLEGEDLY TRIED

 Federal authorities Wednesday arrested an unemployed Woodland Hills couple 
suspected of trying to steal more than $50,000 in government relief funds 
intended for victims of the 1992 and 1993 floods, as well as the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, Douglas Maskart, 53, and his wife, Joyce, 44, are the latest of 
more than 30 people accused of fraud by the Los Angeles Earthquake Fraud Task 
Force, said Assistant U.S. Atty. Nathan Hochman. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the first, however, who authorities allege tried to cash in on two 
earlier disasters, in addition to the Jan. 17 earthquake. The Maskarts are 
accused of submitting false information on aid and loan applications to the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Small Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first instance of someone taking advantage of FEMA and SBA over 
the course of three different natural disasters," Hochman said. 
</P>

 Barbara O'Connor, a federal public defender assigned to represent Douglas 
Maskart, said Wednesday she could not comment on the charges. The Maskarts 
could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors said that damage from flooding in February, 1992, prompted 
the couple to move from their Woodland Hills home in the 4500 block of San Blas 
Avenue to a rented house in the 22000 block of Covello Street in Canoga Park. 
They received federally paid rental assistance for the next 18 months, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble is, they owned the Canoga Park house, said Hochman, and were 
therefore not entitled to the rental assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Following severe flooding a year later, the Maskarts applied for more 
emergency housing assistance because of damage to their Woodland Hills home, 
even though they were still living in the Canoga Park house, Hochman said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Following the Northridge earthquake, the Maskarts submitted three separate 
FEMA disaster relief applications and four applications to SBA, authorities 
said. In two applications, the couple claimed to have been living in their 
Woodland Hills home, which at the time had already been condemned, Hochman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 They also claimed to have lost $34,000 in personal property from their 
Woodland Hills house, including crystal, ceramic art, electronic equipment and 
a piano, according to federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Arraignment is scheduled for Sept. 19 in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Making false and fraudulent emergency disaster claims carries a maximum 
sentence of five years in prison and a $250,000 fine, Hochman said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unrelated case, federal authorities said Wednesday they also arrested 
FEMA inspector Patricia Morris, 38, of Moreno Valley for allegedly submitting 
inspection reports on earthquake-damaged properties she never visited. Morris' 
attorney, also Barbara O'Connor, said she could not comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Morris and the Maskarts were investigated following tips to the fraud 
task force, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, 27 people have been convicted of making false claims following the 
Northridge earthquake, and at least four have been sentenced to prison, Hochman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those convicted, "there have been a lot of hardship cases -- homeless 
people, single mothers," Hochman said.

MAN KILLED WHEN VEHICLE FLIPS OVER ON FREEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 55-year-old Anaheim man died Wednesday when his utility vehicle flipped over 
several times on the Golden State Freeway, smashing in the driver's side of the 
vehicle, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, whose name was not released pending notification of his family, was 
heading north shortly before 10 a.m. in the right lane, just north of the 
Hollywood Freeway, when he decided to switch lanes, said Officer Rich Obregon 
of the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, a vehicle from the fast lane was also trying to switch to 
the middle lane. The two cars did not collide, Obregon said, but the drivers 
saw each other and pulled quickly back into their original lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the man in the utility vehicle pulled back too hard, sending the car 
into a spin, Obregon said. The car flipped over more than three times and slid 
on its rooftop to a stop, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Obregon said the man was pronounced dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Two children in the car -- the man's 12-year-old daughter and a 17-year-old 
boy -- suffered minor injuries and were released from area hospitals, Obregon 
said.

AROUND THE VALLEY: BATTLING THE CONVERSATION QUAGMIRE -- WHAT TO SAY? AND HOW? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My date with Jack the actor still makes me shudder. Jack cut a sharp figure -- 
sexy yet mature -- in the tweed three-piece suit and horned-rim glasses he was 
wearing when we met at one of those Co-Dependents Anonymous meetings. But he 
was so sullen the night we went out that he must have gotten the 12-step 
instructions confused; he released his inner teen-ager, not his inner child. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, I'm not blaming myself (guess that co-dependent stuff actually worked) 
but I was probably falling back on the habits of any reporter faced with an 
uncooperative subject. 
</P>
<P>
 Problem was, it was a date, not an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jack, where are you from?" I asked. "How many brothers and sisters do you 
have? When did you move to L.A.? What kind of acting do you want to do?" 
</P>
<P>
 "What the hell is this," the viper sneered, rearing back to strike, "20 
questions?" 
</P>
<P>
 Boy, did he hit a nerve. But rude as Jack was, I'll be eternally grateful to 
him for reminding me what a lousy conversationalist I am. (Thanks, Jack dear -- 
and what a shame we see so little of you on TV or in the movies these days.) 
</P>
<P>
 It took me four long years to do something about my unsocial tendency to 
interrogate people, but I finally signed up recently for a class called "How to 
Talk to Practically Anybody," offered by Glendale Community College.  
</P>
<P>
 Turns out reporters are not the only ones who need to brush up on the art of 
conversation. There was Paul, a high school student, who took the lead with 
this scintillating gambit: "Wassup?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothin'," I grunted, falling into teen-age dialect. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was Gerry, a legal secretary "over 50" who introduced herself with 
this sure-fire conversation starter: "I find most people boring." 
</P>
<P>
 Silence seemed the safest response.  
</P>
<P>
 Instructor Sherrie Railsback appeared equally undynamic at first. The handouts 
she distributed cautioned against starting conversations on a negative note, 
because complaining and griping "don't usually produce new friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Good point. But Railsback must not have read her own tip sheet, because after 
arriving half an hour late, she droned on and on about the failure of the 
school's administrators to give her proper directions to the classroom, etc., 
while the class of three men and 11 women shriveled in our seats. 
</P>
<P>
 Railsback finally assumed the equally grating but more useful tone of 
schmoozer-cum-karma master, exhorting us to divulge our deepest fears about 
talking to people, then release them as she guided us in meditations designed 
to unlock our vast conversational potential.  
</P>
<P>
 A poll of the class produced enough inhibitions to keep an analyst busy until 
the sun goes cold: fear of rejection, of not being good enough, of being boring 
or too aggressive, of failure and even of success.  
</P>
<P>
 How about if it's all of those fears, asked Mark, 34, a sandy-haired 
construction worker who recently broke up with his girlfriend and took the 
class to meet women. Then it's low self-esteem, Railsback diagnosed, leaving 
Mark with a bigger problem than trying to master a few good pick-up lines. 
</P>
<P>
 She brushed off the fears of Nellie, an immigrant from the Philippines, who 
said in broken English that she feared her grammar "no make sense." Practice 
makes perfect, Railsback said, trotting out an American homily for Nellie's 
edification.  
</P>
<P>
 Railsback also had an answer for Kate, a young art gallery owner who said she 
is at a loss in conversations with customers because, well, to tell the truth, 
she doesn't know much about art. All Kate needs to do is pick up a few art 
quarterlies, Time magazine and that indispensable fount of wisdom -- People 
magazine. After all, Railsback gushed in a prelude of things to come, we do 
live near Hollywood where "it's all happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Then she had us imagine during a guided meditation that our fears had taken 
the form of a gigantic boulder obstructing our path. With eyes closed, we were 
to visualize that we had somehow found a way over the obstacle. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark, like a typical construction worker, attacked the problem head-on: he 
mentally rode a mountain bike over his troublesome new boulder of low 
self-esteem. One woman, figuring that anyone who can imagine a rock can imagine 
big muscles too, simply nudged it aside. 
</P>
<P>
 But try as I might, I just couldn't surmount my fear of not being good enough. 
I tried melting it with a blowtorch, scrambling over it and finding another 
route. No stranger to self-help classes, I even put my arms around it and tried 
to love it to death.  
</P>
<P>
 OK, so the class didn't transform me into an elegant but sophisticated 
raconteur with a tinkling laugh that turns men to jelly. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, interminable as it seemed, Railsback's monologue was actually studded 
with nuggets of information that made the $29 class almost worth a three-hour 
stint on rock-hard chairs. Like: Don't worry about coming up with a 
scintillating opener -- it's more important to start a conversation than to 
dazzle. Try starting a dialogue with a sincere compliment, a time-worn but 
effective method. When you can't think of anything to say, remark on some 
aspect of the common experience, like the weather or the lobby chandelier. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly mirror the other person's tone of voice and gestures and they will 
feel more comfortable with you. Keep the conversation going by listening for a 
thread of unsolicited information and pick up on it. 
</P>
<P>
 And as I learned the hard way with Jack, don't pepper your partner with 
questions. It's amazing how much more information you get when you bite your 
tongue because usually they can't stand the silence either and will start 
babbling.  
</P>
<P>
 But when all else fails, when you're at a party and you've tried the 
oh-isn't-it-hot/stifling/smoky thing to no avail, Railsback offers this 
guaranteed starter-upper: "Are you in 'the industry?' " 
</P>
<P>
 If he says yes, maybe it's Jack. Too bad about that.

BICYCLIST, 64, KILLED IN COLLISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 64-year-old man was killed when he unexpectedly turned his bicycle into the 
path of two vehicles on a heavily traveled street, authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Young of North Hollywood lived at a nearby convalescent home, said Los 
Angeles Police Officer Bill Mulvihill. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred about 2:45 p.m. Tuesday in the 6200 block of Vineland 
Avenue. Young, who was traveling south, abruptly wheeled his bicycle to the 
left, avoiding a car in the lane closest to the curb but steering into the path 
of a van in the fast lane, Mulvihill said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was pronounced dead on arrival at the Medical Center of North Hollywood, 
Mulvihill said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the van was not cited. "There were two vehicles side by side. 
One saw him, the other didn't," Mulvihill said.

BODY OF MAN, 62, FOUND IN BUSHES

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 62-year-old Pacoima man was found dead in bushes along Whitnall Highway near 
Cahuenga Boulevard in an apparent homicide, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have not determined when Roy Haselow died, but said he may have been 
killed in the Pacoima area, said Officer Rick Plows of the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Foothill Division. Haselow carried no identification when a 
passerby discovered his body about noon Tuesday. He was identified by 
fingerprints, Plows said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Kristie Romero said it appeared Haselow had been struck in the face with 
a hard object, although police have not determined the cause of death.

GUARDIAN RECEIVES 78-YEAR SENTENCE FOR MOLESTING GIRL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN W. O'NEILL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As she was dying in January, 1990, Flora Hernandez asked her son to take care 
of her 13-year-old granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, as a jury later found, Robert Anthony Hernandez sexually molested the 
girl. Observing that Hernandez had violated his position of trust, Van Nuys 
Superior Court Judge Michael R. Hoff sentenced him Wednesday to 78 years in 
state prison -- the maximum sentence possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defendant not only violated his vows to a dying woman, but he masqueraded 
as a father figure so he could intimidate and sexually abuse a young child that 
had been left in his care," Deputy Probation Officer Edward Marks said in a 
probation report recommending the maximum sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and prosecutors say Hernandez, 32, of Canoga Park taught the teen-ager 
to drive him home from bars when he was drunk. He took her to motels and over a 
period of more than three years forced her to have sex with him. When she 
refused, he beat her, court records say. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice he impregnated her, the probation report said. She was 13 the first 
time, and he arranged for an abortion. He took her to the clinic in Agoura 
Hills and told her to lie about her age and the identity of the father. A year 
later, the report said, she miscarried. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury convicted Hernandez of 11 sex counts, including continuous sexual abuse 
of a child, forcible rape and sodomy. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim told police that her guardian first forced her to have sex with him 
when he came home drunk about eight months after her grandmother died. After 
that, she said, it happened three out of every four weekends, usually when he 
came home drunk about 2 a.m. on Saturdays or Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 She moved out and reported the sex abuse to police in June, 1993, telling 
officers he "treated her more like a wife than a daughter," police reports say. 
He would become jealous and possessive when she talked with boys her own age 
and criticized the way she dressed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Detective Maria Heissel agreed that Hernandez deserved the longest prison term 
the law allows. "He has a history of abusing women and he should be put away 
for as long as possible," she said in the probation officer's report. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, Hernandez had previous convictions dating from 1983 
to 1991 for disturbing the peace, battery, and driving with a suspended 
license. When he was arrested, he had a drunk-driving case pending. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim told police Hernandez had taught her to drive when she was 13, 
telling her that if they were stopped, police wouldn't arrest her because of 
her age. She said she frequently drove him home from bars when she was 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 17, she is living in a foster home after changing households several times 
following the deaths of her mother, stepmother and grandmother. She is 
receiving counseling.

MOTORIST STRUCK, KILLED LEAVING HIS STALLED CAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 24-year-old man was killed Tuesday night when he got out of his stalled car 
on the Ventura Freeway in Burbank and was hit by another car. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikael Avetisyan of Los Angeles was driving east on the freeway near Forest 
Lawn Drive at about 11:45 p.m. when his car broke down.The vehicle came to a 
stop before reaching the shoulder and partially blocked the slow lane, said 
California Highway Patrol Officer Rich Obregon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, he stepped out of the car into the slow lane, possibly even into 
the No. 3 lane," Obregon said of Avetisyan. "We don't know if he was aware of 
where he was, or whether he just panicked." 
</P>
<P>
 Obregon said Avetisyan died on impact. His body was thrown 100 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The man was hit by a car driven by Makar Jangozian, 21, of Glendale. Jangozian 
has not been charged in the incident because CHP officials believe Avetisyan's 
car "did not have any lights on or anything to forewarn motorists," Obregon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A male passenger in Avetisyan's car was questioned at the scene by CHP 
officers. Officials said the passenger, whose name was not released, apparently 
had consumed alcohol, but it was not known whether the dead man had been 
drinking.

CITY ORDERS STUDY ON ELECTING AIRPORT OFFICIALS; GOVERNMENT: BURBANK ALSO 
RAISES GARBAGE FEES AND APPROVES EXPANSION PLANS FOR CASTAWAY RESTAURANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Heeding opponents of airport expansion, the Burbank City Council on Wednesday 
ordered a study of the possible popular election, rather than appointment, of 
airport commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 During an often contentious meeting that stretched past 1:30 a.m. Wednesday, 
the council also increased garbage fees over 10% and approved plans for an 
expanded The Castaway restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The central issue is whether two councilmen appointed to Burbank Airport's 
governing board can adequately balance the interests of the airport and city 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of plans to increase the size of the airport fourfold contend that 
Robert Bowne and George Battey Jr. cannot look after the public's interest 
while serving the airport's interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Electing airport commissioners would at least give the public greater input, 
some said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it's of paramount importance to determine whether these offices are 
incompatible," Councilwoman Susan Spanos said during the meeting. "It's a 
fundamental policy question for our city." 
</P>
<P>
 The council directed the city attorney's office to prepare a report detailing 
any potential problems such a move might create. 
</P>
<P>
 During debate, Spanos frequently chided the city attorney's staff, contending 
that council members were never adequately briefed on the legal issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Spanos referred to earlier cases cited by the California attorney general, who 
has ruled city officials cannot hold two public positions if "the performance 
of the duties of either office could have an adverse effect on the other." 
</P>
<P>
 Several former and active council members have belonged to the Airport 
Authority since it was formed in 1977 under a Joint Powers Agreement among 
Burbank, Glendale and Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 But conflict of interest has become an issue in Burbank, many say, because 
residents will be significantly affected by the airport's expansion plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Wednesday, Bowne and Battey sided with the majority of council members 
and agreed to have the city attorney's report done, citing a need to move 
forward on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any problem with looking at the election" of airport 
commissioners in Burbank, Bowne said. "I think all three cities would have to 
agree" on it. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also approved a plan for a rebuilt Castaway restaurant that will 
be 3,303 square feet larger than the original, with additional patio space. 
Several restrictions were added, such as limiting the hours of operation for 
the restaurant and banquet rooms to appease nearby residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Garbage collection rates were raised 10.85% to help pay for $5.4 million in 
government-mandated projects that include ground-water treatment and landfill 
excavation. A homeowner with an average monthly bill of $12.77 can expect to 
see an increase of $1.39.

TALKS ON ASSAULT WEAPON BAN STALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bill to broaden California's assault weapon ban was stalled in an Assembly 
committee Wednesday when lawmakers ran out of time to hear all the proposals 
before them. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Assembly Ways and Means Committee are expected to take up the 
proposal for a critical vote today. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill, authored by state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) to plug 
loopholes in an existing ban of assault weapons, would add a generic 
description of the guns to the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Distributors and manufacturers had been getting around the ban, which banishes 
certain firearms, by changing the name or design of military-style assault 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 If the bill passes the committee, its next test will be on the Assembly floor. 
Then, if it passes, it will go to the governor's desk for his signature or 
veto.

17-YEAR-OLD IS KILLED IN CAR COLLISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 17-year-old San Fernando youth was killed in an auto collision at Sepulveda 
Boulevard and San Fernando Road, police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Marvel Williams was a passenger in a car traveling north on Sepulveda when it 
collided Tuesday with a car traveling east on San Fernando, Los Angeles Police 
Officer Bill Mulvihill said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, Amy Safarik, also 17, of Valencia, was taken to Holy Cross Medical 
Center in Mission Hills with severe head and facial cuts, Mulvihill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told investigators that they watched Safarik run a stop sign at the 
intersection, said Detective Rick Talkington. He said he expects to submit the 
case to the district attorney's office for possible charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Joann Virant, 21, of Saugus, the driver of the other car, was not 
hospitalized.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; NEW WARDEN NAMED TO HEAD LANCASTER PRISON; 
CORRECTIONS: ERNEST ROE WAS CHIEF DEPUTY WARDEN IN TEHACHAPI. HE REPLACES OTIS 
THURMAN, WHO CAME UNDER HEAVY CRITICISM AFTER TWO ESCAPES.

<P>
 Ernest C. Roe, a chief deputy warden at the state prison in Tehachapi, was 
named the new warden at the state prison at Lancaster, the governor's office 
announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Roe, 41, has worked for the state Department of Corrections since 1985, said 
J.P. Tremblay, a spokesman for the state Youth and Adult Correctional Agency, 
which oversees the Corrections Department. 
</P>
<P>
 He replaces Otis Thurman, the prison's first warden who was forced to resign 
in February under heavy criticism from the public and state officials after two 
escapes by maximum-security prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 Thurman's temporary replacement, John Ratelle, an interim warden for five 
months, cited a "lack of attentiveness" by the prison's staff as the leading 
factor in the escapes.  
</P>
<P>
 When Thurman submitted a report suggesting that construction flaws at the 
18-month-old prison may have been partly to blame, that report was corrected on 
several points by department officials in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald R. Hill, warden at the Tehachapi prison, replaced Ratelle and served as 
interim warden since the beginning of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's office informed Roe of his appointment by telephone Wednesday. 
He later attended a meeting of the Lancaster Citizens Prison Advisory Committee 
later in the day to introduce himself to committee members and the public, said 
Roger Skaggs, a spokesman at the California Correctional Institution in 
Tehachapi. 
</P>
<P>
 Roe is a former deputy sheriff in San Joaquin County who began his career with 
the state Department of Corrections in 1985 as supervisor of its training 
academy at the Sierra Conservation Center in Jamestown. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, he took another supervisory position at the Deuel Vocational 
Institute in Tracy, where he later became the assistant chief of education and 
an associate warden. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He moved to the 5,700-inmate Tehachapi facility in 1989, where he rose to 
deputy chief warden and took charge of the operations of the minimum-, medium- 
and maximum-security facilities, as well as the reception area, Tremblay said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roe's duties at Tehachapi included overseeing the prison's medical services, 
housing and recreation programs, classification and discipline of prisoners and 
its records department, Tremblay added. 
</P>
<P>
 Tip Kindel, a spokesman for the state Corrections Department, said he hoped 
Roe's appointment coupled with increased security measures will help alleviate 
the community's "justifiable concerns about the escapes and security at the 
institution." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something that the community has every right to demand from us, and we 
demand it from our administrators," Kindel said. "We're hoping with all the 
steps that have been taken, we can earn the confidence of the public in that 
community, but we will have to re-earn that trust." 
</P>
<P>
 Lancaster Mayor Frank Roberts, who serves on the advisory committee and met 
Roe on Wednesday, said Roe's appointment was a step in the right direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is soft-spoken and a well- educated guy, and I think things are going to 
be OK," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Next month, the Antelope Valley Transit Authority will begin using the 
prison's minimum-security inmates to help maintain the transportation agency's 
bus fleet, Roberts said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MALL OFFERS $2,500 REWARD AFTER FATAL SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley Mall offered a $2,500 reward Wednesday for information 
leading to the arrest and conviction of the person or persons who shot to death 
a 16-year-old boy July 5 outside the shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said Efrain Pablo Brito of Palmdale was 
fatally wounded during an argument with other youths in the mall's parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, investigators identified the gunman as Adolfo Real Jr., 23, of 
Palmdale and obtained a warrant for his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's homicide Lt. Ray Peavy said Real remained at large Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 In a prepared statement, Antelope Valley Mall representatives said they are 
offering the reward "to help facilitate the legal process and to send a message 
to the community that we will not tolerate violent acts in our community 
without doing our civic duty to help stop them." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is our wish that this cash reward will help speed the resolution of this 
tragic incident," the statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brito was a 10th-grade student at Littlerock High School. He was believed to 
be the first person to die as a result of a shooting at the shopping center, 
which will be 4 years old next month.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PARENTS WORRY THAT NEW SCHOOL WILL CAUSE 
UNWANTED TRANSFERS; EDUCATION: STEVENSON RANCH CAMPUS WILL FORCE THE NEWHALL 
DISTRICT TO REDRAW MANY ATTENDANCE BOUNDARIES. A FINAL DECISION ISN'T EXPECTED 
UNTIL JANUARY. 
</P>

<P>
 A new elementary school will force the Newhall School District to redraw many 
of its attendance boundaries, leaving some parents worried their children will 
be forced to attend less desirable schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevenson Ranch Elementary School is scheduled to open in the fall of 1995 
with an enrollment of about 500 students, said district Supt. J. Michael 
McGrath. The school is the first in the large Stevenson Ranch housing 
development just west of Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 About 275 students live in the development, so the remaining students will be 
bused in from some of the district's six other schools, McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposed boundaries probably will not be established until November, with a 
final decision expected in January, McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Suzanne Shapiro, a Valencia parent, said she is concerned that her son 
might be transferred from Meadows Elementary School, one of two in the district 
recognized as a nationally distinguished school during the 1993-94 school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro is a member of Parents for Neighborhood Schools, a group formed by 
parents at the end of the school year when they learned about the restructuring 
plans. Some parents have indicated they bought homes near Meadows because of 
its good reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is we don't want our kids to move," Shapiro said. "I didn't 
buy a house for another area. I choose this area for our children." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the group's members are Meadows Elementary parents, but that is 
because they were the first to find out about the district's plans, said 
Stephen Nathanson, another parent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if it doesn't affect me, it's the precedent here," he said. "If we allow 
them to implement busing (of students to other schools), it's just the first 
step in doing other things." 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath said Meadows parents are among those with the least to worry about. He 
said most transfers will come from Wiley Canyon and Old Orchard elementary 
schools, both closer to the Stevenson Ranch school. 
</P>
<P>
 Several guidelines will be followed, such as minimizing the number of children 
bused to school to hold down transportation costs, McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My guess would be that of the children already being bused to schools, we 
will find a population that will fit into the Stevenson Ranch school," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district is required by law to enroll an ethnic balance of students at 
each school, he added. In addition, district officials will probably try to 
minimize future boundary changes by anticipating some of the area's growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "They might move more kids now than would be absolutely necessary in order to 
provide longer-term stability, so we would have to do it less often," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other substantial impact on students and their parents could come from 
adjusting year-round school schedules implemented to ease overcrowding at Wiley 
Canyon and Valencia Valley elementary schools, McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the district is likely to consider reverting to a traditional schedule 
at those schools if redrawing the boundaries eases the crowding.  
</P>
<P>
 But, McGrath said, he does not favor that action. "If we go off the year-round 
schedule, we'll have to go back on again when we're overcrowded (in the 
future)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials will seek input from parents at six meetings between Sept. 
19 and Oct. 11. The meetings, from 7 to 8:30 p.m., will include a 20-minute 
presentation about why the boundaries are being changed. 
</P>
<P>
 Meetings are scheduled Sept. 19 at Meadows Elementary School, 25577 Fedala 
Road; Sept. 21 at Newhall Elementary School, 24607 Walnut St.; Sept. 22 at 
Wiley Canyon Elementary School, 24240 La Glorita Circle; Sept. 28 at Valencia 
Valley Elementary School, 23601 Carrizo Drive; Oct. 3 at Old Orchard Elementary 
School, 25141 Avenida Rondel, and Oct. 11 at Peachland Elementary School, 24800 
Peachland Ave.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CITY COUNCIL BACKS TAX DISTRICT FOR COUNTY 
LIBRARIES; ASSESSMENTS: THE PROPOSAL TO MAINTAIN FACILITIES WOULD COST SANTA 
CLARITA HOMEOWNERS ABOUT $28.50 A YEAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Swayed by dozens of supporters, officials have agreed to make this city part 
of a special tax district projected to raise $30 million for Los Angeles County 
libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members voted 5 to 0 late Tuesday night to join the Communities 
Facilities District, which would annually charge property owners slightly more 
than the price of a hardback book. Homeowners would pay $28.50 per parcel and 
condominium owners $21.38 per unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is supposed to be a premier city," Councilwoman Jo Anne Darcy said. "You 
can't have a premier city without a premier library." 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of residents turned out at the council meeting Tuesday night, many 
waiting more than four hours to speak in favor of the library system. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors is scheduled to vote on the 
Community Facilities District on Tuesday, and members wanted to see if cities 
supported the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 It is based on a Mello-Roos district, a funding mechanism most often used to 
pay for infrastructure improvements by charging area property owners an added 
fee on their property tax bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County library system serves 3.3 million people in 52 cities 
and 28 unincorporated communities and has 87 branches. Branches are operating 
in Santa Clarita's Canyon Country and Newhall communities. A third branch in 
Valencia is undergoing repairs for damage sustained in the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The approval was a rare move for Santa Clarita council members, who are 
usually reluctant to back new fees. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff members even recommended that the city not participate in the 
district, at least for its first year. They warned that the district may be 
challenged in court because of its non-traditional use of the Mello-Roos 
mechanism. They also voiced concerns about the fee's establishment with minimal 
public input. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the founding principles this city was founded on was public 
participation and local rule," said Rick Putnam, city director of parks, 
recreation and community services. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the unanimous vote Tuesday, not everyone on the council supported the 
assessment district. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the most onerous things I have seen," said Councilman H. Clyde 
Smyth, calling the proposal "ill-conceived" and "not honest." 
</P>
<P>
 Voters in the Santa Clarita Valley's unincorporated areas, such as Castaic, 
Val Verde and Stevenson Ranch, would face the fee regardless of the city's 
stance. Smyth said he wanted to ensure that the fee benefits those voters, who 
are served by the city's libraries.  
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that bothers me the most is that the vote we cast doesn't just 
affect the city," Smyth said. "I will support it because it is so unfair to the 
people who have nothing to say about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council's decision includes a provision for Santa Clarita officials 
to annually review their participation in the district.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; FAIR EXPECTED TO DRAW 300,000; CELEBRATION: 
TANK ROLLS ONTO GROUNDS AMID HECTIC PREPARATIONS FOR ANTELOPE VALLEY GALA. 
CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST ALLEGATIONS CLOUD MOOD.

 A 54-ton Army National Guard tank rolled though Palmdale and Lancaster on 
Wednesday, then entered the Antelope Valley Fairgrounds, adding yet another 
attraction to the popular festival just two days before its opening. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11-day Antelope Valley Fair and Alfalfa Festival, which will open at 3 
p.m. Friday, is expected to attract up to 300,000 visitors from as far as 
Bakersfield and San Bernardino as well as the San Fernando Valley. Activities 
will range from traditional livestock judging to performances by nationally 
known country music stars. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, fair participants were scurrying to get the Lancaster 
fairgrounds in shape and putting the final touches on exhibits. Young people 
groomed their sheep and cattle, carnival workers set up thrill rides, and 
refreshment stand operators spruced up their booths. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in this business for 20 years, and this is always the most fun 
week," said Bruce Latta, the fair's general manager. "It's like a jigsaw 
puzzle. You see all of your efforts over the year coming together." 
</P>
<P>
 But as organizers put the finishing touches on this year's event, Latta 
confirmed that state officials in Sacramento were reviewing 
conflict-of-interest allegations involving two Antelope Valley fair board 
directors, throwing a cloud of uncertainty over this year's event. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the directors, Betty L. Smith, has triggered concern by questioning 
fair administrators about a trash collection contract sought by her employer, 
A. V. Rubbish. Earlier this week, Smith voted to award the contract to another 
company that submitted a lower bid, but some fair officials believe she should 
have abstained. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said Wednesday that she has consulted a private attorney and does not 
believe she has acted improperly. "I think it's been blown out of proportion," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials also are reviewing the actions of fair board member Steve 
Landaker, whose billboard company does business with the fair. Landaker, too, 
has denied any improprieties. 
</P>
<P>
 Latta said the board members' conduct is being reviewed by a deputy attorney 
general assigned to state fairs. Fair board members are appointed by the 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
 During a festival preview Wednesday, fair board members did not mention the 
investigation but instead invited reporters to observe the final preparations 
for this year's event. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the more unusual sights was provided by the Army National Guard unit 
based in Palmdale, which moved its battle tank out of the armory and onto the 
fairgrounds about 18 miles away. To get there, the tank made a rare low-speed 
excursion across public streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies escorted the vehicles, which sometimes took up more than 
one traffic lane. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people waved and applauded," said Capt. Jim Estes, commander of the 
unit. "I think they like to see their tax dollars in action." 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors will be allowed to climb on top of and inside the tank during the 
fair. 
</P>
<P>
 While Estes was moving his tank carefully onto the fairgrounds, Cameron Wyman, 
15, of Lancaster was carefully trimming his yearling ram's hoofs in the 
livestock area. Cameron, who raises sheep and pigs, has entered some of his 
animals in the fair's livestock judging and auction. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager said his pigs require less grooming than the sheep. The pigs, he 
said, "are easier to get ready. But they get into more trouble at home. They 
get out of their pens." 
</P>
<P>
 Fair officials hope the livestock judging, musical acts and unusual new events 
such as lawn mower races will attract a broad range of visitors. The paid 
attendance at last year's fair was down about 7% from the previous year, which 
was attributed partly to the state's sluggish economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the economy, a heat wave could also drive down the number of fair 
visitors, and organizers were hoping for cool weather over the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The No. 1 factor in determining attendance," Latta said, "is the weather."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; REGULATION OF PEDDLERS TIGHTENED; COMMERCE: 
THE CITY WILL ISSUE LICENSES AND STRENGTHEN REQUIREMENTS FOR ROADSIDE VENDORS, 
WHO FEAR HIGHER COSTS.

<P>
 Don't be surprised if the price of amber-tinted sunglasses, large ceramic 
vases and Oriental-style throw rugs begins to go up here. 
</P>
<P>
 These are just some of the products sold along Santa Clarita's roadsides, 
where vendors will soon face stricter licensing requirements and stiff fines 
for failure to obtain a city permit to peddle their wares. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members voted 5 to 0 Tuesday night to require city permits for 
peddlers and solicitors in Santa Clarita, updating a much looser ordinance 
taken over from Los Angeles County in 1987. Permits now will be issued by the 
city rather than the county, but the program and its enforcement will still be 
administered by the county. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials hope to crack down on sellers who don't take out the necessary 
permits, which cost $125 for the first year and $45 for subsequent years. The 
new ordinance, which goes into effect in mid-October, also establishes fines of 
$500 for first-time violations and $1,000 for subsequent violations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is this going to do the job?" asked Councilwoman Jan Heidt. "Is this going to 
allow the Sheriff's Department to arrest these people operating illegally out 
of shopping carts?" 
</P>
<P>
 Heidt, owner of a small bookstore, echoed the frustration of business owners 
who feel they are being undercut by peddlers and of residents who don't want 
solicitors knocking on their doors. 
</P>
<P>
 A Newhall resident told the council she once enjoyed buying corn on the cob 
and ice cream from vendors who walked through her community with food carts. 
But she said she was sickened at seeing a seller stop and urinate on the 
ground, then resume his rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunglasses, vases, rugs, stuffed animals, framed posters and various food 
products are some of the items offered from the side of the road at different 
times of the year. Santa Clarita also was swamped by T-shirt vendors after the 
Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Some vendors say they support stricter enforcement of the licensing 
requirements but are wary of additional fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Ramsey, owner of the Fresh Berries fruit stand on Soledad Canyon Road, 
said she already pays about $600 in annual fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is the council aware of the fees we are already paying the county?" Ramsey 
asked. "I think you should keep in mind that we are small businesses." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is scheduled to review the ordinance and its enforcement 90 
days after the law goes into effect.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CITY WARNED OF HOUSING PROPOSAL ON AMMO SITE; 
DEVELOPMENT: CRITICS CITE LIKELY LEFTOVER TOXIC MATERIAL IN THE SOIL AND A ROAD 
SYSTEM THAT IS EXPECTED TO BRING NOISE. 
</P>

<P>
 Dozens of residents here are sending up a flare about a massive residential 
development to be built on the site of an old munitions factory in the center 
of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Several people warned the City Council at its meeting Tuesday that the 
2,911-unit Porta Bella housing project is fraught with potential liability for 
the city because of likely leftover contamination on the property and a 
questionable road system. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not opposed to development. We're opposed to this type of development," 
said Christopher Townsley, a Placerita Canyon resident. "We don't like it being 
ramrodded down our throat." 
</P>
<P>
 As proposed by Northholme Partners, Porta Bella includes 1,667 condominiums 
and 1,244 single-family homes to be built on 996 acres south of Soledad Canyon 
Road and east of San Fernando Road in the Saugus area. It includes a 27-acre 
business park, 450 acres of preserved open space and land set aside for Santa 
Clarita's future civic center. 
</P>
<P>
 Porta Bella is the largest residential development project in Santa Clarita's 
seven-year history. It was approved by the city Planning Commission in June and 
is scheduled for a series of public hearings before the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics, led by residents of the nearby Circle J Ranch community, note the 
likelihood of toxic material remaining in the soil. The Whittaker Corp. 
manufactured and tested ammunition, explosives and flares there from 1906 to 
1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility of heavy metals being in the soil was raised by the draft 
environmental impact report prepared for the project in 1993, as were concerns 
that Porta Bella will cut into a major ridgeline and add traffic to already 
busy streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Department of Toxic Substances Control and the federal Environmental 
Protection Agency have identified 14 distinct spots at the site containing 
waste of munitions-related byproducts. Whittaker has cleared 13 of them, so 
far, to the satisfaction of authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty-four other sites have been identified as having possible contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita officials have long said they will require Whittaker Corp. to be 
liable for any future toxic problems at the site, but residents said lawsuits 
would undoubtedly be directed against anyone considered negligent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a 2-year-old son," said resident Renee Sabol. "If anything happens to 
my son because of negligence, God help them." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents also are concerned about the road system proposed through the 
property, including elevated overpasses that are expected to bring traffic 
noise to the nearby community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw what happens to overpasses in the earthquake," said Dean Cheeseman, a 
Circle J Ranch resident. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Porta Bella's developers say the project provides Santa Clarita with needed 
infrastructure, including a better network of roads that may actually deflect 
traffic from the Circle J Ranch community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want this project to be successful," said Sam Veltri, project manager. "I 
believe we have demonstrated that with our planning process." 
</P>
<P>
 Council members Tuesday agreed that both the toxic contamination and road 
system issues must be addressed before Porta Bella will be considered for 
approval. They are scheduled to visit the Porta Bella site at 7 a.m. Sept. 24, 
in a tour that is open to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're interested in doing this one right," said Councilwoman Jo Anne Darcy. 
"If it's not right, we won't pass it."

SENATE LEADERS BARGAIN, BATTLE OVER CRIME BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With their partisan stalemate over $30-billion crime legislation in its third 
day, Senate leaders Wednesday engaged in a round of bargaining and bluffing, 
leaving both sides unsure which has the votes to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans need at least 41 votes to prevail on a procedural maneuver that 
could throw the bill open to unlimited amendment, which they contend is 
necessary to strip the legislation of pork-barrel spending and add tougher 
anti-crime measures. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Democrats insisted that amendments would doom the measure because 
changes would upset the fragile compromise worked out last weekend in the House 
-- which would have to approve the legislation again. Moreover, they said the 
GOP's real agenda is denying President Clinton a political victory and 
stripping the bill of its ban on 19 types of assault-style weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton made a public appeal for the legislation Wednesday, saying: "It's time 
to put away the excuses, the blames and the politics and join forces to pass 
this crime bill now." Using a satellite hookup from the White House, he made 
the comments to a meeting of the B'nai B'rith Jewish service organization in 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the scenes, the President and top Administration officials engaged in a 
heavy, coordinated round of lobbying aimed at a handful of moderate Republicans 
whose votes will determine the fate of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of them have signed a letter indicating that they would support 
Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) on the procedural motion, if there is no 
other way to change the bill. But no one is certain how strong their commitment 
will be when the final vote comes. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, a spokesman for Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-Kan.) noted that 
although she signed the letter, "her bottom line is, she wants a crime bill." 
</P>
<P>
 Polls show that crime is the nation's top priority and the legislation would 
be the first major crime bill to come out of Washington in six years. Making it 
all the more crucial is the fact that this is a congressional election year in 
which an unusually high number of seats -- as well as Democratic control of the 
Senate -- are thought to be in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 The centerpiece of the crime legislation is enormously popular: $13.45 billion 
in new spending for law enforcement on the state, local and federal levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost $9 billion of that amount would be spent on matching funds aimed at 
putting 100,000 new police officers on the street. However, Republicans say the 
number is vastly inflated. 
</P>
<P>
 The droning speeches on the Senate floor Wednesday were a sideshow to the real 
action outside the chamber, where there were a series of closed meetings among 
Republicans and between Dole and Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell 
(D-Me.). 
</P>
<P>
 Making his latest proposal, Dole handed Mitchell a list of 10 amendments on 
which the Republicans wish to force votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Four would strip the six-year bill of roughly $5 billion in spending for 
programs that Democrats describe as crime-prevention measures and Republicans 
insist are liberal social causes -- funding that Sen. Charles E. Grassley 
(R-Iowa) described as "a hangover from the Great Society." 
</P>
<P>
 Another amendment would tighten the uses to which additional prison funds 
could be put and make it easier for prison administrators to apply for them. 
The remaining five would toughen penalties in areas ranging from drug sales to 
minors to crimes committed with weapons, as well as expedite the deportation of 
criminals who are also illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Notably absent was any effort to rid the bill of the assault-weapons ban, 
which had been among amendments proposed by Dole the previous day. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Mitchell insisted that the maneuver amounted to an indirect 
attempt by opponents of the ban to do in the House what they did not have the 
votes to do in the Senate. The majority leader argued that by amending the 
bill, the Senate would send it back to the House, giving the stronger 
opposition there another chance to delete the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole, however, dismissed that assertion, saying that House rules would not 
allow such an amendment, unless it were approved by the Rules Committee, which 
is controlled by the Democratic leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who charge that this is some back-door attempt to eliminate the gun ban 
are firing blanks," Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell said he would meet with Senate Democrats today to discuss the GOP 
proposal, but it was clear he did not plan to accept an approach that he said 
would perpetuate "an endless circle" of bargaining between the House and 
Senate. He also noted that nothing in the Dole offer would prevent a Republican 
filibuster of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very difficult to see what we gain from this process," Mitchell said. 
"I've not yet been able to grasp how that presents anything advantageous or 
attractive to us." 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the day, both Dole and Mitchell said they were uncertain whether 
they had the votes to prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet both their hands are likely to be forced in the next day or two. The 
Senate is already two weeks behind schedule for beginning its August recess, 
and members of both parties -- particularly those with difficult reelection 
battles -- are anxious to return home. 
</P>
<P>
 Many senators are suggesting privately that Mitchell could have a revolt on 
his hands if he seeks to keep them in session past the end of this week. That, 
however, would mean delaying Senate consideration of health care legislation 
until after Labor Day. Senate GOP's Stand on Crime 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to demands to eliminate prevention programs that they call "pork," 
Senate Republicans have a series of proposals designed to lengthen prison 
sentences for crimes involving drugs and guns. 
</P>
<P>
 THE REPUBLICAN DEMANDS 
</P>
<P>
 * Eliminate about $5 billion in "social spending," leaving only provisions to 
combat violence against women in the crime-prevention category. 
</P>
<P>
 * Require that first-time violent offenders serve their full sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eliminate burdensome requirements that state prison administrators must meet 
in order to get federal prison funds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Permit a judge to deport an illegal immigrant convicted of a crime, as soon 
as the defendant's sentence is served. 
</P>
<P>
 * Impose mandatory minimum penalties for crimes in which a gun is used; for 
selling drugs to minors; for employing minors to sell drugs; and for drug lords 
convicted for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 * Require that federal prosecutors have a role in any decision to waive a 
mandatory minimum sentence.

O.C. SAT SCORES HIGH BUT SLIP AS MORE TAKE TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last year's graduates from Orange County public high schools outscored their 
peers across the state and nation on the Scholastic Aptitude Test, but most 
local districts saw their average scores slip from the previous year as 
increasing numbers of students took the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance continued the county's tradition of high achievement on the 
math and verbal standardized tests, key factors used in college admissions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the county looks very well for the percentages of kids in the 
districts that took the exam," said John F. Dean, superintendent of the Orange 
County Department of Education. "We want to encourage the students to take the 
exams. The more kids we can get thinking in that direction, the more kids are 
heading to college, and I think it's wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport-Mesa Unified Supt. Mac Bernd also attributed the drop in his 
district's scores to the growing number of students taking the tests, many of 
whom have poorer academic backgrounds and might not have considered college in 
previous years. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're talking about two issues. You're talking about quality and you're 
talking about equity," Bernd said. "They're both important. You've got to work 
on them both. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea was to have the percentage (participating) go up and have the scores 
go up. The worst case is when they both go down and the best case is when they 
both go up. We've got the middle case." 
</P>
<P>
 The county's average was not computed, but every local district except Santa 
Ana Unified bested California and U.S. average scores on the math segment. On 
the verbal portion, Santa Ana Unified, Garden Grove Unified and Anaheim Union 
-- the three districts with the largest number of students whose native 
language is not English -- were the only districts in Orange County to fall 
below state and national averages. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, nine of the 15 local districts saw test scores decline from last year 
on both portions of the tests, some more than 10 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, members of the Class of 1994 scored 413 on the verbal test and 482 
on the math exam, two points lower on each section than graduates achieved the 
previous year, according to data to be released today by the nonprofit College 
Board, which administers the SATs. Nationally, students averaged 423 on the 
verbal segment and 479 on the math portion. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the county's 58 public high schools, 21 scored below the state average 
on the verbal test and nine were below the average in math. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's largest district, Santa Ana Unified, had the county's lowest 
scores: 335 on the verbal test (down from 344 last year) and 428 on the math 
(down from 436 in 1993). One quarter of Santa Ana's Class of 1994 took the SAT. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, (we) were disappointed and concerned," district spokeswoman Diane 
Thomas said, adding that administrators plan an in-depth analysis of the drop 
in test scores. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas noted that while slightly fewer members of the Class of 1994 took the 
SAT compared to the Class of 1993, some 121 students took the American College 
Testing program, another admissions exam, this year. The combined number of 
test-takers shows an overall rise in college-bound students. 
</P>
<P>
 The scores are "very new information and we're going to be looking at (them) 
hard," she said. "(We'll be asking) what changes have there been? Were they 
positive or negative changes? And what changes do we need to make to make 
things work better?" 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach Unified posted the county's highest average verbal score, 471. 
Irvine Unified, traditionally among statewide leaders in all test scores, had 
by far the best math average, 578, nearly 100 points higher than the national 
average of 479 and more than 25 points higher than the closest competitor among 
Orange County districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine also had the widest participation in the exam, with 71% of last year's 
graduating class taking the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "It starts with hard-working, motivated students and supportive parents, but I 
think it's a function of a focused effort on what happens in the classroom, on 
learning, and less on structure," Irvine Unified Supt. David E. Brown said. "We 
restructure and change what improves learning, not what sounds catchy and 
what's current." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said his district offers little classroom-based training for the SATs, 
but that many students participate in private tutoring programs or use computer 
software to help prepare for the standardized tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown credited Irvine's large population of stable, middle-class families who 
are keenly interested in their children's education and the district's 
decentralized management style for its success. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where we've been talking (about and giving) lip service nationally to 
site-based management, we've been doing that here for a long time," he said. "I 
think the results are pretty amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 Among individual schools, Irvine's University High showed the highest scores, 
averaging 502 in verbal, 607 in math. None of the county's 57 other public high 
schools broke 500 on the verbal test or 600 on the math. University's combined 
score of 1109 was more than 200 points above the state and national averages. 
</P>
<P>
 Other schools with high scores on the verbal section were Laguna Beach High 
(471) and Corona del Mar High (473). In math, Fountain Valley High, Foothill 
High in Tustin and Irvine's Woodbridge High all posted the second-highest 
average score of 566. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana High had the county's lowest score on the verbal section, 304. 
Century High, fared only slightly better, at 311, and had the county's poorest 
average math score, 367. Santa Ana's Saddleback High was also more than 100 
points below the state and national averages with a score of 369. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback Valley Unified saw the largest gains among Orange County districts, 
jumping 11 points in math to 532 and six points in verbal to 451. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so excited," said Saddleback School Board President Dore J. Gilbert. 
"We're thrilled. It's just one more positive thing that's going on in the 
district." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the Brea Olinda Unified district, the latest round of scores were 
another bit of bad news for an award-winning high school that spent the summer 
struggling through a scandal over illegally altered student transcripts. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the school's 1994 SAT scores -- 428 verbal and 523 math -- remain above 
state and national averages, they show one of the county's largest declines 
from the previous year -- nine points in verbal and 14 in math. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea Assistant Supt. Peter Boothroyd said the district has instituted an SAT 
preparation course at the high school to curb any downward trend in scores. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more students you have taking them," the harder it is to keep the average 
up, Boothroyd said. "The high-end kids always take (SATs) so now it's probably 
more of the kids on the lower end." 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange Unified, where scores dropped four points in verbal to 438 and 
declined 14 points in math to 514, acting Supt. Robert French attributed the 
change to unusually high scores among the Class of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to look over five years because one year may be a blip up or a blip 
down," French said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Class of '94 is a different group than the Class of '93, they're 
different kids. On a five-year plane we're on an upward swing. If we were going 
down over five years, then I'd worry." 
</P>

<P>
 Continuing a trend of high performance on the college admissions tests, most 
members of Orange County's Class of 1994 outscored their peers statewide and 
across the nation on the Scholastic Aptitude Tests. But most districts saw 
their average scores slip as increasing numbers of students took the tests.

FRONTIERE LEAVES DOOR OPEN -- BUT JUST A CRACK; RAMS: OWNER WON'T RULE OUT 
KEEPING THE TEAM IN O.C. BUT HAS VERY LITTLE HOPE. TASK FORCE MEETS WITH SHAW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Rams owner Georgia Frontiere said Wednesday that she remains open to keeping 
her team in Anaheim but held out little if any hope of such a deal -- 
especially if Orange County fails to build her a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does come down to staying in business -- I wouldn't dream of leaving if I 
could stay in business," Frontiere said after a group of Save the Rams leaders 
met with her top advisers to spell out plans that include a refurbished -- but 
not new -- Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is always hope, but unless something drastically changes I don't see 
how we can. You know when the bankers start saying this is it, you have to 
start listening to them." 
</P>
<P>
 In deciding what to do next, Frontiere is relying on Rams President John Shaw, 
who met Wednesday for two hours with members of the Save the Rams task force at 
the team's Pico Boulevard offices in Los Angeles. Task force members detailed 
ideas for the remodeled stadium, a new office complex and practice facility -- 
plus a $50-million plan to buy part of the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, task force members said they were pleased that the two sides were 
talking at all. "I was happy not to get tossed out of the office," Orange 
County Supervisor William G. Steiner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Newport Beach sports agent Leigh Steinberg, the group's co-chairman: 
"They appeared interested and intrigued by some of the elements of the 
proposal. . . . They said they needed time to analyze it and they would get 
back to us in a couple weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw remained characteristically noncommittal in assessing the offer in 
relation to lucrative proposals from cities such as Baltimore and St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a preliminary negotiating meeting during which the Save the Rams 
organization made a financial proposal for keeping the Rams in Anaheim," Shaw 
said in a one-paragraph statement. "We are reviewing their proposal and 
anticipate other meetings with the Save the Rams organization." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, who have suffered more than a 35% drop in season ticket sales while 
substantially boosting their payroll with free agent acquisitions, have 
projected a $6-million loss this season. Frontiere earlier empowered Shaw to 
explore the possibility of moving the team in time to play elsewhere next year. 
</P>
<P>
 In an extensive interview Wednesday, in which she apologized for not attending 
a Rams booster kickoff luncheon last week, she reacted cautiously to 
enticements offered by Save the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how real any of these things are, but certainly they have the 
right intentions," said Frontiere, who did not attend Wednesday's meeting. "I 
think as long as negotiations are open, again, where there's light, there's 
hope. I mean we're exploring all the options. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is we have a wonderful country that allows us to go where we can 
make a living." 
</P>
<P>
 But Frontiere said any proposal that is intended to keep the team here will 
probably have to include a new football stadium. And she said she might be 
willing to accept a minority partner to get one built. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone had that much of an interest, I would be agreeable to selling a 
minority part of the team," she said. "I've been a little gun-shy in the past 
about doing that because so many people have tried to get involved. But that's 
not beyond the realm of possibility; if there's someone who wants to just pour 
money into a sinking ship. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 While Save the Rams members declined to discuss the details of the group's 
offer, which was hastily cobbled together in the last three months by local 
businessmen and government leaders, it is known to include: 
</P>
<P>
 * A revamped football-only Anaheim Stadium complete with improved sight lines 
to the playing field, more than 100 plush luxury boxes and lucrative club 
seating with waiter service. Save the Rams members have said season ticket sale 
guarantees would also be part of the package. The plan would entail building a 
new stadium for the California Angels baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
 * A new Rams corporate headquarters and practice facility including a 
two-story, 40,000-square-foot building, 2 1/2 football fields, a weight room, a 
locker room and 400 parking spaces. The center would be built on the 26-acre 
site of the Stadium Drive-In theater in Orange, near The Pond in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 * A $50-million infusion of cash through purchase of a minority interest in 
the team. Some Save the Rams members have indicated that 10 yet-to-be-chosen 
investors, from inside and outside the group, will contribute $5 million each 
toward the purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 After Wednesday's meeting, Steiner said the offer to buy part of the team had 
become a separate issue. "The package could fly with or without it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But it remains to be seen whether the deal will be enough to persuade 
Frontiere and her Rams, who have deep roots in Southern California, to resist 
the lucrative lures being dangled by several East Coast cities. All have made 
new stadiums part of their offers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Frontiere said she has not made a deal to move the team to Baltimore or 
St. Louis. "We're not even close," she said. "They've thrown things out, but 
they could be pie in the sky, they could be real." 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis continues to be plagued by an internal dispute regarding its stadium 
lease. In Baltimore, Peter Angelos, managing partner of the Baltimore Orioles, 
expressed an interest in buying a minority interest in the Rams. But those 
negotiations broke off when Angelos insisted upon majority ownership at some 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 Frontiere insists that she will not part with the team she has run since her 
husband, Carroll Rosenbloom, drowned in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the trouble," Frontiere said, "from Day 1 when Carroll died, people 
have been trying to buy my team. I'm not going to sell a majority interest in 
the team, no, no, a thousand times no." 
</P>
<P>
 But she said she would consider selling a minority interest to facilitate a 
move to another city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would want a partner that I could get along with and work with," she said. 
"Right now I really don't have any idea where we're going to go. We really 
haven't zeroed in on anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything can happen. If somebody suddenly came along here and said they were 
going to build us a new stadium. . . . It would probably take all of L.A. and 
Anaheim together to get that kind of thing, but who knows?" 
</P>
<P>
 As for Southern California, many football fans' hopes hinge on the Save the 
Rams plan, perhaps the best the region can muster. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if our effort fails, and I don't think it will, it speaks very well for 
Orange County and our community spirit that this group came together and we 
were able to make an offer," said attorney Andy Puzder, who attended 
Wednesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 But Frontiere said she didn't want to give local fans "false hope." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough right now and I don't know how I can make someone feel better when 
they're probably going to lose their team. It's very hard. You can feel 
sympathy, but then people say, 'If you really feel sorry why would you go?' 
This is my home. I don't want to go, but what can we do?" 
</P>
<P>
 Frontiere, who as a rule stays out of the spotlight, also said Wednesday that 
she wanted to address Rams fans because it was a mistake on her part not to 
attend the team's kickoff luncheon last week. 
</P>
<P>
 She was out of town at the time and under physicians' orders not to fly 
because of an ear infection, "but I could have still tried to come," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It traditionally has been a function for the players, and I didn't realize 
how disappointed people were that I wasn't there until later," she said. "I 
would have liked to talk to the fans; I really empathize with them, but I don't 
want to lead anyone on." 
</P>
<P>
 Frontiere spent millions this off-season to sign quarterback Chris Miller and 
defensive tackle Jimmie Jones, a year after paying big money to land linebacker 
Shane Conlan and defensive end Fred Stokes. But defeat and criticism continue 
to make her life unpleasant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Listen, I've been fighting this off for the past two or three years," she 
said. "I've been hoping something would change. I'm not a stubborn person; it's 
not all money, otherwise I would have gotten out a long time ago. I don't want 
to get out. I love the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some ways I blame myself for what has happened, although not completely. I 
probably stuck with coaches too long, assistants too long, players too long. I 
want to win as much as anyone. I look at the people who have been Ram fans for 
so many years, and I feel awful for them, but there just aren't enough right 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 "We worked hard in the off-season to improve this team. Selling out means a 
lot; it makes a difference. But I know you can't force somebody to love you, 
that's the problem. But I would just hope people have a little faith in our 
ability to win this year."

</P>
<P>
 * Stadium: Under the Save the Rams plan, the 69,008-seat facility would be 
refurbished to include club seats, and luxury boxes would be upgraded. Other 
possibilities include lowering the playing field to improve sight lines. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rest of the deal: Save the Rams proposes construction of a new state-of-the 
art office and practice facility and a $50-million infusion of cash through 
purchase of a minority interest in the team. Under the current stadium lease, 
the Rams pay rent of 60 cents per admission, not to exceed $400,000 per year. 
The Rams also give Anaheim 7.5% of ticket revenue, 20% of luxury box revenue 
and about half of parking and concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Advantages: Rams avoid paying a penalty of approximately $30 million for 
leaving Anaheim as well as the litigation that would almost certainly accompany 
a move. Team maintains a tradition dating back to 1946. A sweetened stadium 
lease would also be a likely result of any decision to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 * Disadvantages: If Big A refurbishment is to create a football-only facility, 
another expensive stadium would have to be built for the Angels. And Rams owner 
Georgia Frontiere has said that a new facility would probably be necessary to 
keep the team here anyway.

by lotteries and stadium revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rest of the deal: All revenue from tickets, sky boxes, club seats, parking 
and concessions goes to the team, which would pay a nominal rent. Team would 
get Colts' renovated training facility. 
</P>
<P>
 * Advantages: Projected team profits of $28 million by fourth year of 
operation. Strong fan interest demonstrated by baseball Orioles' 1993 
attendance of 3,644,965, seventh-highest total in major league history. 
</P>
<P>
 * Disadvantages: Interest in Colts waned in years before 1984 departure to 
Indianapolis. Redskins' intention to build new stadium in nearby Laurel, Md., 
could disrupt Baltimore's plans. 
</P>
<P>
 ST. LOUIS 
</P>
<P>
 * Stadium: A $258-million, 70,000-seat domed stadium, paid for with bonds 
backed by state and local governments, will be completed in 1995 and will have 
101 sky boxes and 6,550 club seats. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rest of the deal: All concession, in-house advertising, sky box and club 
seat revenue to team. Team would pay $250,000 per year but $75,000 in game-day 
expenses would be paid for. No training facility exists. 
</P>
<P>
 * Advantages: St. Louis (metropolitan area population 2.47 million) is the 
nation's largest city without an NFL team, and it has the largest television 
market (18th) without a team. Would fit well in any NFL realignment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Disadvantages: Conflicting ownership groups doomed 1993 expansion bid. All 
discussions with Rams on hold until lease dispute is resolved. Has stigma of 
losing Cardinals to Phoenix in 1988.

CLOTHES MAKE THE STUDENT, SCHOOLS DECIDE; EDUCATION: LONG BEACH PUPILS WILL 
WEAR UNIFORMS STARTING IN SEPTEMBER.

 The uniforms are coming. 
</P>
<P>
 What was once the domain of the parochial school is making its move into the 
world of public education -- with the blessing of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 For the likes of Jesus Cervantes of Long Beach, the uniform revolution means 
trading in his T-shirt and baggy shorts for navy blue pants and a white polo 
shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 For Santa Ana fifth-grader Maria Gomez, it means bowing to her mom's fashion 
wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 And for Yolanda Vasquez, a Sun Valley parent, it means a quick way to "tell 
the bad people from the good." 
</P>
<P>
 From the malls to the schoolyards, standardized school clothes were a top 
subject of conversation Wednesday, one day after Gov. Pete Wilson signed into 
law a bill allowing school districts to choose the uniformed approach. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of school districts around the state, including some in Southern 
California, have had voluntary uniforms for some time. And school districts 
around the nation are taking a serious look at what might have been unthinkable 
before the era of gang colors. 
</P>
<P>
 And nowhere are uniforms making a bigger sartorial splash than in Long Beach, 
where the school board in January, citing concerns over gang-style attire in 
the classroom, ordered mandatory uniforms for its 57,000 elementary and middle 
school students. 
</P>
<P>
 When the policy goes into effect next month, it will mark the first time that 
a major U.S. city has made uniforms standard dress for its public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Some may protest, but there is no question that Mary Marquez is a believer. 
She is the principal of Long Beach's Whittier Elementary School, which has been 
experimenting with voluntary uniforms for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 During that time, the school, in an economically depressed part of the city, 
has gradually improved in a number of academic areas. And it was announced this 
week that Whittier had the lowest absentee rate of Long Beach's 82 schools. 
Marquez attributes part of that success to the uniforms, which she said make 
for a much more even playing field when it comes to clothes. And there is no 
confusion about a child unwittingly wearing gang-style garb to school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parents are pleased to have something worn that can't be mistaken for 
gang attire," she said. "The teachers are very happy with it, that kids come to 
school ready to learn. No one thing is going to fix everything, but it is an 
important step in making the students feel like they are a part of things." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that all are in agreement about the value of the uniform. Some, for 
instance, complain about the cash outlay for the special clothes, while others 
say they stifle the creativity of the children. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics have also contended that if uniforms are imposed, then students will 
find some other method of expression, such as expensive jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 "In adolescence, identity and attire are related," said Ted Mitchell, dean of 
the UCLA School of Education. "One's identity is a lot about dress, so it 
complicates matters some." 
</P>
<P>
 The American Civil Liberties Union has come out against uniforms, and so has 
Jesus Cervantes. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesus, a 14-year-old eighth-grader at Mary Butler Middle School, was dressed 
Wednesday in a Colorado Rockies T-shirt and baggy shorts. He wasn't buying the 
official line on the need for uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not gangbangers," he said. "We just want to be kids and have fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, in the outdoor lunch area, a group of students gathered and offered 
further critiques. Some pointed out that one of the required colors -- blue -- 
is the shade favored by one of the city's biggest gangs. Other decried the 
monotony of their wardrobes since the uniforms came into vogue. "It's like the 
same thing every day for lunch, breakfast and dinner," said January Prince, 10, 
a sixth-grader. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mary Butler uniform is a white top and navy skirt, pants, shorts or 
jumper. The code is technically optional until September, but school officials 
said most of the students are already wearing uniforms. Punishment for those 
who flout the code has not yet been established. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised at how easy it was," said James Thomas, a coordinator for the 
magnet school. He said the school had been ready to deal with reluctant parents 
or rebellious students, but almost everyone was dressed according to code on 
the first day of classes, which began in early August because the school is on 
a year-round schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 One parent, Diane Fike, said she was glad her youngest son, who just started 
at Mary Butler as a fourth-grader, would be surrounded by navy and white. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is a safety issue," Fike said. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in the community can really watch out for these kids when they're in 
uniform," she said. "Plus, I do think it's a social equalizer." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the students' gripes were to be expected: "Kids are going to want to 
do what they want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Kirk Tyler, the 13-year-old Student Council president at Mary Butler, said he 
is wearing his uniform -- but reluctantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you get used to it now it won't become a big problem when you have to do 
it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kirk, an eighth-grader, still questioned the necessity of the dress code. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to learn if I'm going to learn," he said. "The clothes can't tell 
you that you're going to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you can really blame anything on clothes," he said, recalling a 
friend of his who had gotten into gang trouble. "It wasn't how he dressed, but 
how he treated people." 
</P>
<P>
 Some students, however, supported the dress code. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel safer from all the gang violence and stuff," said Annie Laeardonn, an 
eighth-grader. 
</P>
<P>
 Many, though compliant, were less than enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want the freedom of what I wear," said Andrew Tully, 10, eating his lunch 
in a bright-colored T-shirt and shorts. "It's my 1st Amendment right." 
</P>
<P>
 In other parts of Southern California, there are other experiments with 
uniforms. At the new La Mesa Junior High in Santa Clarita, a pilot program has 
been implemented for seventh-graders, requiring them to wear clothing in the 
school colors of black, white and teal. Daniel Hanigan, the assistant 
superintendent of the district, said Wilson's signing the bill into law had 
been met with relief because the uniform policy was approved earlier in the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, Santa Ana has 26 schools in which students may wear 
uniforms, the largest number in the area. Santa Ana administrators said they do 
not plan to make their programs mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, the UCLA dean, praised the law as "sort of an inoculation against 
controversy." 
</P>
<P>
 He also saw benefits in the Long Beach policy: "It relieves a certain kind of 
pressure we see in public schools -- what I have on as opposed to the things 
they ought to be focusing on, which is learning." 
</P>
<P>
 The trend also has ramifications for business. 
</P>
<P>
 Melissa Salazar, an employee at one of three Target stores in long Beach, said 
the store is selling hundreds of uniforms a day. But a manager of Chaktomouk 
fashions, which sells children's clothes in Long Beach, said sales are down by 
about $50 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can deal with it," said Paul Cheng, the store manager. "I would sacrifice 
that amount of money to make a kid safer in their own school." 
</P>

STUDIO CHIEF KATZENBERG TO LEAVE DISNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN HARRIS and CLAUDIA ELLER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Walt Disney Co. shocked Hollywood and Wall Street on Wednesday by announcing 
that veteran studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg will leave the company next month 
after losing a highly publicized campaign to be named second in command to 
Chairman Michael D. Eisner. 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg -- who helped engineer the company's staggering success with 
animated movies such as "The Lion King" and new ventures such as the Broadway 
adaptation of "Beauty and the Beast" -- was rebuffed by both Eisner and 
Disney's board of directors on grounds that he was not right for the No. 2 job. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner delivered the news late Wednesday morning. "The job that (Katzenberg) 
would have wanted does not exist in this company," Eisner said. "We're going to 
strengthen the company through the divisions." 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg's departure leaves Burbank-based Disney without one of its chief 
creative forces. In 10 years he helped build the studio into a perennial box 
office leader, and encouraged its growth into the lucrative TV production 
market and other areas. Operating income for filmed entertainment rose steadily 
under Katzenberg's regime, from $2.2 million in 1984 to $622.2 million in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney on Wednesday moved quickly to fill the void by announcing that 
Katzenberg's duties will be taken over by two executives. Joe Roth, who set up 
his production company at Disney two years ago, was named chairman of Walt 
Disney Motion Pictures, and studio President Richard Frank was named chairman 
of the newly created Walt Disney Television and Telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
 Eisner also announced that Sanford M. Litvack, Disney's executive vice 
president for law and human resources, will take on more day-to-day supervision 
of internal administration as well as dealings with governments, communities 
and other corporations. All these moves, Eisner said, will strengthen the 
divisions and enable him to operate without a president. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources say Katzenberg, 43, a compulsively driven executive, pushed Eisner too 
hard for the No. 2 job after Disney President Frank G. Wells was killed in a 
helicopter crash in April. "He backed Michael into a corner," said one critic. 
"He campaigned for the job in the news media. That's hardly the way to get 
along with your boss." 
</P>
<P>
 Others said the two executives were too similar in their hands-on, creative 
approach. "You can't have two chefs in the kitchen," said longtime Disney board 
member Raymond L. Watson, vice chairman of the Irvine Co. Although Eisner 
underwent emergency quadruple bypass surgery last month, Watson said the board 
is confident that succession is not an issue for the 52-year-old chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg's most serious board opposition came from Vice Chairman Roy E. 
Disney, according to sources. The Disney scion, who oversees animation, is said 
to have felt that Katzenberg took undue credit for the revival and success of 
animated features. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was trying to take all the bows for it, and forgetting what his real job 
was, and that was live action," one source said, adding: "The truth is, no 
board member thought he was equipped to be president." 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Disney stopped short of threatening to resign if Katzenberg was promoted, 
sources said, but his displeasure carried great weight. Ten years ago, he 
resigned from the board and mounted a campaign that ultimately dislodged 
management. Roy Disney then helped install the Eisner-Wells team with backing 
from the wealthy Bass clan of Fort Worth. On Wednesday, one source said, clan 
member Sid R. Bass concurred with the board's view of Katzenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg's office was quiet Wednesday as he made a series of calls to key 
executives. He appeared composed, even smiling as he discussed his fate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now it's time to move on," he said. "I wanted a challenge beyond the job I've 
done for 10 years and Michael could not create that opportunity for me here at 
Disney." 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors immediately surfaced that Katzenberg would be bound for Sony Pictures 
Entertainment or MCA Inc., the parent company of Universal Pictures. Katzenberg 
denied that he has had any job discussions, and Sony went to the unusual length 
of publicly denying that it had offered him the chairman's post. 
</P>
<P>
 His immediate plan, Katzenberg said, is to "go with my family to Walt Disney 
World." 
</P>
<P>
 By all accounts, conversations about Katzenberg's future began nearly a year 
ago with Eisner and Wells, months before the latter's death. But more recent 
talks never advanced to "the question of title and job description," Katzenberg 
said. "It was more about the kind of opportunities I was looking for and hoping 
for and the kind of growth and challenge I want." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, music mogul David Geffen, a close friend, said Katzenberg was 
ambivalent about staying at Disney. He said Katzenberg turned down a two-year 
contract extension offer last year that would have guaranteed him $100 million 
in stock options and grants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really speaks to what an incredible guy Jeffrey is and what he thinks of 
himself that he was willing to get out of that contract," Geffen said. "He 
wants to run his own company, and he certainly will." 
</P>
<P>
 One mark against Katzenberg was Disney's slip in recent years in live action 
features. Even as the company boosted production to more than 40 movies a year, 
films such as "Blank Check" and "Father Hood" faded quickly at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney announced Katzenberg's departure after the close of stock market 
trading Wednesday. Several securities analysts said they expect Wall Street to 
absorb the news calmly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a loss of a very talented film executive, but Disney is not 
going to curl up and die," said one large institutional investor, who spoke on 
the condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Jeffrey was perceived as being the sole genius at the company," 
added David Londoner, an analyst at Wertheim Schroder & Co. in New York. "Live 
action films haven't worked well for the last three or four years, although the 
first five years were terrific." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Katzenberg and Eisner worked together for nearly 20 years, beginning 
at Paramount, their relationship was distant. Many compared it to a troubled 
father-son relationship from which Katzenberg could never escape. Still, 
executives on Disney's Burbank lot expected them to work out a solution. News 
of Katzenberg's departure left his loyalists heartsick. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is all Michael. He never tried to make it work," said one stunned studio 
executive, who said morale has sunk with the news. In light of Katzenberg's 
loyalty and hard work, employees were asking each other, "If this is how 
Jeffrey is treated, what are they going to do to me?" the executive said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miramax Pictures Co-Chairman Harvey Weinstein, who sold his successful 
independent company to Disney, expressed dismay. "I'm shocked, I'm stunned, I'm 
not feeling too good," he said. "Jeffrey was always there for me. If you fail, 
he's your best cheerleader. If you win, he kicks you in the butt and says you 
can do a little better." 
</P>
<P>
 But Eisner downplayed any serious repercussions, saying: "This is not a 
Shakespearean tragedy. This is people moving on with their lives, and doing new 
and interesting things." 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling his own stints at ABC and Paramount Pictures, Eisner said, "After 
seven or 10 years, you've really got to reinvent things." Katzenberg "is 
looking for a store of his own," Eisner said. "He doesn't want my job, per se, 
but he wants a job like my job."

 The Clinton Administration, racing to deflect the continuing torrent of Cuban 
refugees, said Wednesday that it is expanding its detention facilities at the 
Guantanamo Bay naval base in Cuba to hold as many as 60,000 people -- three 
times the camps' present capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 The move, unveiled at the White House by Defense Secretary William J. Perry, 
will force the Pentagon to bring home some 1,700 dependents of U.S. naval 
personnel now living at the base to avoid overtaxing the water and sewage 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
 The construction of the additional detention facilities, which Perry told 
reporters should be completed by the end of next week, is designed to help 
persuade would-be refugees that Washington is serious about denying them entry 
into the United States and that they should stay home. 
</P>
<P>
 Perry and Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, who appeared with him at a news conference, 
also served notice that the United States is prepared to keep refugees at the 
detention camps "indefinitely," even if the standoff between Washington and 
Havana continues for years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do not risk your lives," Reno warned in a message aimed at the refugees and 
their relatives who live in South Florida. "You should not expect that you will 
come to the United States. You are going to Guantanamo or other safe havens, 
and you will not be processed." 
</P>
<P>
 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers later reiterated that caution: "All 
of the refugees picked up at sea are taken to Guantanamo," she said. "There is 
no plan to take or house any refugees here in the United States -- period. " 
</P>
<P>
 The developments came as the flood of Cuban refugees continued unabated, with 
federal authorities reporting some grisly scenes in which bodies of refugees 
have been found floating near makeshift rafts, apparently after the emigrants 
died of dehydration or illness. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coast Guard reported that it recovered 2,791 rafters in the Florida 
Straits by late Wednesday, after picking up 3,253 on Tuesday, the highest 
one-day number since the Mariel boat lift of 1980, when Cuba intentionally 
shipped about 125,000 refugees to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that the expansion of the detention facilities at Guantanamo 
Bay, on Cuba's southeast shore, would involve a major undertaking by the 
military, including a sharp increase in the number of military security forces 
on the island and additional support troops to take care of the refugee 
population. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, while Perry said that the camps might be expanded to accommodate 
40,000 or more refugees, military officers said later that the Navy had 
received orders to provide for between 45,000 and 60,000 refugees if necessary 
-- up from a capacity of 23,000 now. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said as many as 8,000 more Marines and soldiers will be needed to 
provide security for the base. The Pentagon already is shipping some 600 
Marines and military police troops to the naval base. 
</P>
<P>
 The expansion represents a staggering increase from current levels. The 
detention camps at Guantanamo currently house 14,000 Haitians and 2,000 Cubans. 
Another 7,000 Cubans are en route aboard U.S. vessels and should arrive by 
Friday. Although Perry declined to provide any figures, officials said that the 
expansion is likely to prove costly. 
</P>
<P>
 In her remarks Wednesday, Reno confirmed that the Administration is working 
out new procedures to make it easier for Cubans to emigrate through traditional 
channels by applying for a visa through the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Wednesday, the Administration continued its hard-line stance against 
Cuban President Fidel Castro, rejecting a Cuban overture to begin broad-scale 
U.S.-Cuban talks designed to work out a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Fernando Remirez de Estenoz Barciela, Cuba's ambassador to 
the United Nations, said that Havana would be willing to negotiate over the 
emigrant issue but only if Washington agrees to discuss ending the U.S. embargo 
of Cuba and abandoning the Guantanamo Bay naval base. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that the Administration has negotiated with other countries whose 
regimes it has opposed, Remirez called U.S. policy on Cuba "an additional 
example of the type of double standard that we have so frequently seen here." 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes later, however, Peter Tarnoff, U.S. undersecretary of state for 
political affairs, rejected Remirez's proposal, telling reporters at the White 
House that "we see nothing to be gained from the kind of talks you're referring 
to." 
</P>
<P>
 "It should be clear after 35 years to Fidel Castro and his government that the 
way he has been managing the affairs of the island is a failure," Tarnoff said. 
"He is being told that by his own people. That's why they want to leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Perry also warned Cuba not to worsen the exodus by encouraging would-be 
refugees to enter Guantanamo Bay naval base through the back gate, saying that 
the United States would "regard this as . . . an unfriendly act . . . and would 
take appropriate action." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also indicated that, unlike its policy regarding Haitian refugees 
brought to Guantanamo Bay, the United States would not actively pressure Cubans 
to go back to Havana. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's hard-line tone toward the Castro regime apparently is 
designed to bolster the impression that it is not going to relent on its 
present policy, no matter how many Cubans set sail for U.S. shores over the 
next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials had hoped that merely announcing reversal of the 35-year-old policy 
of admitting Cuban refugees without question would stem the tide of emigrants 
toward Florida. So far, however, the numbers have been rising, not falling. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing its actions, the Administration effectively said that it is 
willing to keep the detention camps indefinitely -- until Cuba adopts a 
democratic form of government and agrees to repatriate them. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno's tough talk drew a mixed reaction in Miami's Cuban American community, 
which already is divided over the Administration's new approach. Many Cuban 
Americans believe that the flotilla must be stopped, yet few are eager to see 
Cuban rafters detained indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Cesar Odio, Miami's city manager, lauded the decision, saying: "We should be 
happy to have a President who stands firm behind his decisions." 
</P>
<P>
 But hard-line Spanish-language radio commentator Armando Perez Roura of Radio 
Mambi condemned the detention policy, calling on the Administration to impose a 
total blockade of the island. He called Castro's failure to stop the rafters 
"an act of war." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. effort to deal with the flood of Cubans -- combined with the 
two-month-old blockade of Haiti and detention of Haitian refugees -- has drawn 
a sizable armada to the region, straining Navy and Coast Guard ships and 
aircraft to the limits. 
</P>
<P>
 As of late Wednesday, the Coast Guard had 32 full-size cutters and 35 smaller 
boats on patrol in or en route to the Florida Straits, along with 14 search 
aircraft. The Navy has 13 warships either in the area or on their way. 
</P>
<P>
 Adm. Robert Kramek, the Coast Guard commandant, told reporters in Key West, 
Fla., that, although the service had been able to siphon vessels away from drug 
interdiction and fishery law enforcement temporarily, it could not go on 
indefinitely without hurting those areas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not being overwhelmed," he said, but "obviously if you do it a very 
long time, it has a detrimental effect on all of your other missions." At the 
same time, he added optimistically, "I'm fairly confident that we may not have 
to keep it up that long." 
</P>

NEWS ANALYSIS; SCOPE OF PRI WIN IN MEXICO A BLOW TO OPPOSITION PARTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING and SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A resounding ruling party victory in an election billed as the most hotly 
contested poll in six decades has stunned the opposition and clouded the future 
of multi-party politics in this country. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition parties, which had expected a good showing in the presidential 
vote and a strong representation in the next legislature, were devastated by 
the returns that continued to roll in Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it seems to have won the presidency with its lowest percentage of the 
vote in modern history, the governing Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) 
appeared to have not only almost doubled the tally of its nearest competitor in 
the top race but also swept the Senate contests and taken 278 of the 300 
districts in the lower house. 
</P>
<P>
 All three major parties will receive seats in both houses based on a system of 
proportional representation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the opposition's apparent failure to win more races outright left many 
analysts worried that the overwhelming PRI triumph will undermine voter 
confidence in partisan politics as a means for change, increasing the 
likelihood of violence among dissidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six years of clamoring for change have done nothing to affect the political 
system," said writer and social critic Homero Aridjis. 
</P>
<P>
 The major leftist party, the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), has 
announced plans for the traditional post-election opposition response: marches 
and demonstrations protesting fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 But the conservative National Action Party (PAN) -- which has blocked its 
share of international bridges and highways in the aftermath of votes -- 
virtually conceded defeat this time. 
</P>
<P>
 In the coming months, analysts expect both opposition parties to re-evaluate 
their positions in the national political process. 
</P>
<P>
 "The entire political system has failed to resolve the crisis," said David 
Castro Ruiz, a PRI activist in Chihuahua, a state governed by the PAN. "There 
must be a series of changes, not just in the PRI, but in all the parties." 
</P>
<P>
 These elections generally had been expected to mark the beginning of a true 
multi-party political system in Mexico. This country has a long history of 
nominal opposition parties but none had ever been considered a realistic 
alternative to the PRI monopoly on government. 
</P>
<P>
 That was supposed to change this year. 
</P>
<P>
 All but the most extreme elements of the fractious left had been united under 
the banner of the PRD. 
</P>
<P>
 Their candidate, Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, son of this nation's most revered 
20th-Century president, was expected to have long coattails, carrying into the 
Congress candidates who would express the poor, rural South's disenchantment 
with the radical free-market reforms of the past decade. The campaign appeared 
to be laying the groundwork for a Mexican version of a social democratic party. 
</P>
<P>
 The PAN entered the race in the strongest position of its 55-year history, 
with three state governorships and a glib, colorful litigator as its 
standard-bearer. 
</P>
<P>
 Cigar-smoking Diego Fernandez de Cevallos moved into first place in many polls 
after he outshone his stodgy rivals in Mexico's first televised presidential 
candidates' debate. PRI activists in PAN-governed states even began to speak of 
alternancia , the idea of political parties taking turns in power. 
</P>
<P>
 Against these two apparently strong contenders, a PRI shocked by the March 23 
assassination of its chosen candidate was forced to run a substitute whose 
selection had deeply divided the ruling party. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the opposition's best shot at the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 It missed. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the PAN and the PRD must now regroup, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the heaviest burden for change will fall on the PRD. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to lead the PRD to an enormous amount of soul-searching," said 
political analyst Denise Dresser. "There will be a tremendous questioning of 
Cuauhtemoc Cardenas' leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas, widely believed to have been cheated out of the presidency by vote 
fraud six years ago, has refused to compromise or negotiate with the government 
in any election since. As a result, while the PAN has made deals that gave the 
party the first opposition governorships of this century, the PRD has been able 
to defend victories in only a few town halls. 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts expect a coup within the PRD that will oust Cardenas. The 
question would then become whether the PRD can survive without his moral 
leadership. "Is it a real party or a following of yet another caudillo 
(political boss) in Mexican history?" Dresser asked. 
</P>
<P>
 If the PRD falls apart, it will leave the 17% of Mexicans who voted for 
Cardenas without a political voice, a prospect that deeply worries many 
Mexicans. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a mortal blow for Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the PRD and the Mexican left," 
said Aridjis. "Mexico has a courtesan left that is close to the government, and 
a real left of students, workers and peasants. This could provoke a major 
crisis that will separate them and lead to violence." 
</P>
<P>
 That is the prospect that the PRD has tried to avoid, said Deputy Patricia 
Ruiz. "We believe in a peaceful road to democracy," she said. "But the only 
peaceful road we consider legitimate is elections." 
</P>
<P>
 While the PRD has publicly insisted it lost only because of electoral fraud, 
the PAN has emphasized questions of fairness in the overall political system 
and questioned its own role in the defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 In Baja California, a state that became a symbol of opposition-party hopes 
when the PAN won its first governorship there in 1989, the PRI's overwhelming 
sweep of presidential and legislative races left PAN leaders stunned and 
pensive about the future. 
</P>
<P>
 The surprisingly lopsided results bolstered PRI ambitions of winning back the 
state in next year's gubernatorial race, which should be close. 
</P>
<P>
 Repeating longtime complaints that the ruling party unfairly used federal 
funds and a biased press to push its candidates and attack PAN administrations, 
opposition leaders predicted that those tactics will intensify. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, PAN activists comforted themselves that, although their party's 
performance may have fallen short of expectations, they still had record 
results. "I can assure you, because I know National Action, that we will push 
forward," Fernandez told reporters earlier this week. "Ten million votes are a 
lot of votes and a lot of responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez transmitted that sentiment of optimism to rank-and-file supporters, 
such as Perla Figueroa, 16, who answered telephones for him -- the first time 
she has ever volunteered in a political campaign. "Now I am out in the world," 
she said. "I realize there is a need for change. If it does not come now, we 
will make it come later." 
</P>
<P>
 If the PAN is to effect that change, the party must promote its achievements 
and improve the quality of its candidates, one Baja official said. The party 
must also fight a perception that it is aloof and insensitive, particularly to 
the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 But above all, the PAN must govern better after it wins, observers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The PAN did poorly in states where it governs," said Dresser. "The PAN must 
realize that if it doesn't do a good job, it can be thrown out." 
</P>
<P>
 The PRD has suffered similar problems at the local level, such as in Aridjis' 
hometown of Contepec in the Cardenas stronghold of Michoacan. "They voted the 
PRD in, then later voted them back out," he recalled. "They were extremely 
corrupt and very inept. Nothing changed at all." 
</P>
<P>
 That reflects a growing sophistication among some voters at the same time that 
others, particularly impoverished PRI supporters, tend to rely on their party 
as a paternalistic benefactor, said Baja California Gov. Ernesto Ruffo Appel. 
</P>
<P>
 "This division results from the political evolution of the nation," Ruffo 
said. "It is between those who can fight for themselves . . . and those who 
have great needs and are so dominated by them that they are at the mercy of 
(political parties) who aid them. We must ensure that this aid respects the 
dignity of the individual to construct a better Mexico and that need is not 
exploited for political means."

COLUMN ONE; FLYING THROUGH TURBULENCE; BOLD AND SAVVY, C. MICHAEL ARMSTRONG IS 
STEERING HUGHES AIRCRAFT THROUGH A STORMY ECONOMY. WITH HIS TRIUMPHS HAVE COME 
A FEW BIG BUMPS -- ESPECIALLY FOR WORKERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES F. PELTZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a summer Saturday in 1993, a fiftysomething white guy wearing jeans and 
cowboy boots joined a street party in South-Central Los Angeles to celebrate 
the reopening of a small grocery store destroyed by the riots. 
</P>
<P>
 Donning a Harley-Davidson baseball cap, he strolled through the neighborhood, 
mingling with a crowd that included rapper Snoop Doggy Dogg and members of the 
Crips and Bloods. That he was a big shot at Hughes Aircraft Co. -- California's 
largest industrial employer -- was "the last thing you would have thought," 
said community organizer Danny Bakewell. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, he was the top Hughes big shot -- C. Michael Armstrong, chief 
executive of the concern founded by pioneer aviator Howard Hughes. He was there 
without his usual corporate entourage to learn firsthand what was happening in 
the riots' aftermath. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a personal interest in supporting the community," he said later in an 
interview, sounding puzzled that his visit required an explanation. His 
involvement "is not done for visibility," he said. "It's done for citizenship." 
</P>
<P>
 Bakewell had invited Armstrong on a lark -- and was stunned when he showed up. 
But, in fact, Armstrong's trip to South-Central was emblematic of a man who has 
splintered the mold for how Southern California's aerospace executive elite 
behaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it's exploring social problems on his own time or twisting lawmakers' 
arms to aid Hughes' business, Armstrong is among those rare corporate birds who 
seize opportunities to stand out and speak up. 
</P>
<P>
 A familiar figure among the opaque fraternity of defense chiefs, he is 
generally unknown beyond his own business boundaries. Yet his clout is immense 
and his decisions have an enormous impact on California's economy -- an impact 
frequently unkind to workers in the cause of ensuring Hughes' future. 
</P>
<P>
 Engaging, politically savvy and an expert at selling his point of view, 
Armstrong is both tireless and shameless in his efforts to influence public 
policy for favorite causes, including the role of small business in the inner 
city and improving the state's business climate. 
</P>
<P>
 He has clearly made his most indelible mark at Hughes, arguably the most 
successful and experimental of the nation's defense firms in adapting to a true 
peacetime economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Southern California in particular has learned, Armstrong's 2 1/2-year 
stewardship at Hughes has helped cause immense hardship on the factory floor. 
To keep the company in the black, he has cut 13,000 jobs in the last two years, 
helping create huge craters in the local economy. He has even admitted 
resorting to duplicity with the public to emphasize political reforms he 
embraces. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Armstrong's efforts to help create employment in South-Central 
Los Angeles or his finding fault with state government red tape ring hollow 
next to the damage that his actions have caused, his critics say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hughes has done more negative to Southern California, simply in the transfer 
of jobs out (of state), that dwarf whatever crumbs they've thrown to 
South-Central," said Joel Kotkin, a fellow at Pepperdine University's business 
school. "His credibility is not that great." 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong makes no apologies, saying his actions are necessary for Hughes to 
survive. He's certainly not alone. More than 300,000 aerospace and defense jobs 
in California have vanished since the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, as Hughes Aircraft goes, so goes the California economy in many ways. 
Each has endured wrenching job losses, and each is betting on an expansive 
future in which defense work plays a shrinking role. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes is redefining itself as part of the most abrupt transformation in its 
50-year history. Like the state, it now has to hustle hard to drum up business 
-- something it did not used to do. 
</P>
<P>
 What Armstrong will acknowledge, though, is that his actions can leave 
thousands of his remaining workers unsettled. "I don't think I underestimate 
the anxiety that this pace of change produces," he said. "Change and 
competition are really great theories, until they start happening to you." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Armstrong -- a six-foot southpaw with a ruddy complexion and blue 
eyes -- so far has steered Hughes impressively through the changes. Despite 
shrinking Pentagon budgets, Hughes earns a handsome profit. 
</P>
<P>
 One-third of its $8.8 billion in sales last year had nothing to do with 
military equipment and hardware, but rather stemmed from the sale of commercial 
satellites and electronic components tied to information technology and 
telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
 But Armstrong is not done cutting jobs to get Hughes' costs down further. 
Despite having shed 32,000 jobs since the mid-1980s, Hughes, a division of 
General Motors Corp., said in June that it expects to drop about 3,400 jobs in 
Fullerton, El Segundo and Tucson, Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
 Tucson is the home of Hughes' missile operation, which itself was consolidated 
in Arizona last year after being moved from Canoga Park, Pomona and other 
sites. That move eliminated 5,000 jobs. Hughes still has 34,000 workers in the 
state among its 50,000 worldwide. So it is no wonder that its chairman is among 
California's most vocal corporate citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 He has pushed Gov. Pete Wilson and Assembly Speaker Willie Brown to improve 
the state's business climate, and jawboned President Clinton to relax U.S. 
sanctions against China that hurt Hughes' satellite division. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong responded to the China sanctions by sending a stern letter to 
Clinton last year, complaining that the ban could cost Hughes $1 billion of 
business and up to 5,000 jobs. Armstrong took his gripe public and, six months 
later, the Administration again cleared Hughes' satellites for export to China. 
</P>
<P>
 As the defense industry's leading apostle of converting defense know-how to 
commercial uses, Armstrong has appeared before congressional panels to promote 
Hughes' conversion efforts -- and used the occasions to pitch the company's 
satellite-to-home television service, DirecTv, that debuts this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 He also was a vocal director and occasional critic of RLA, the fractious 
entity trying to help repair the city's riot-torn economy, until he joined 14 
other directors recently in resigning from the group's board. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Armstrong knows that he risks being perceived by some as a political 
dilettante if his calls for public reform become too repetitive or too shrill. 
"I worry about that," he said. "My visibility has been about as much as I would 
like to see it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There's good reason why Armstrong embraces the limelight more than most of his 
colleagues: He did not come from the defense industry, which tends to promote 
reserved engineers and technocrats to its executive suites. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Hughes tapped him, Armstrong, 55, spent more than three decades 
climbing the ladder at IBM, a company built on marketing and service acumen as 
much as technology. Before he left, he headed IBM's giant foreign division. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong's marketing skills are helped by an ease in front of crowds that 
goes back to his days as senior class president at Redford High School in 
Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether a member of sports teams or school groups, Armstrong assumed 
leadership effortlessly, according to his brother, Dr. Jack Armstrong. "You 
could see him almost palpably lifting the spirit of the house" when Armstrong 
visited home on college breaks, his brother recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 But Armstrong's ability to command has been tested at Hughes, which for most 
of its history was the antithesis of IBM. 
</P>
<P>
 Clubby and insulated, Hughes was known for its premier technological 
expertise, not marketing, and its management was bred from within its ranks of 
engineers and scientists. Hughes also had just one customer to satisfy: the 
Pentagon. 
</P>
<P>
 That began changing dramatically in the mid-'80s when defense spending started 
to fall and Hughes was bought by General Motors for $5.2 billion in 1985. The 
events forced Hughes to emphasize growth, profits and marketing as much as any 
corporation whose stock is publicly traded. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world shifted from one where competitions were won by technical 
excellence to one where they were won by cost," said John Harbison, aerospace 
director for the consulting firm Booz, Allen & Hamilton. "That shift in the 
market caused a lot of problems for Hughes." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Hughes decided that its future hinged on weaning itself from the 
Pentagon by selling more goods to the commercial and foreign markets. 
</P>
<P>
 So Hughes not only peddles Tomahawk missiles, radar for F-15 fighters and 
display screens for Navy ships, but also DirecTv, communications satellites for 
U.S. cable companies and air-defense radar systems for foreign nations. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall, Hughes will ask households nationwide to plunk down $700 for an 
18-inch dish -- and a cable-like monthly service fee of about $25 -- so they 
can receive DirecTv's 150 channels of programs beamed from two satellites. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Hughes' commercial forays stem from its military technology. One 
reason it is considered perhaps the best practitioner of defense conversion is 
that it is one of the few firms that see such technology transfers "as a 
serious and worthwhile pursuit," said Jon Kutler, president of Quarterdeck 
Investment Partners, which focuses on conversion efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, many of Hughes' conversion programs were spawned by Armstrong's 
predecessor, Malcolm R. Currie. It was also under Currie that Hughes joined 
other defense firms in launching massive layoffs in response to Pentagon 
spending cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong took Currie's lead and ran with it, accelerating the layoffs, 
streamlining and diversification. And it is Armstrong alone who is struggling 
to persuade workers to embrace tenets that -- for Hughes -- are radical, such 
as: The company must aggressively market its products and listen to each 
customer's needs. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which makes Hughes' managers as anxious about their futures as its line 
workers. "I don't think there's a senior vice president who isn't afraid of 
him," a Hughes insider said. "It used to be that if they were given profit 
goals and came up short, nothing happened. Armstrong wants performance." 
</P>
<P>
 He seems to be getting it. Hughes is part of GM Hughes Electronics Corp., a 
division of General Motors also headed by Armstrong that includes the Delco 
Electronics group. In 1993, GM Hughes' operating profit jumped 32% from the 
year before, to $922 million, as sales rose 10% to $13.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the stock market values GM Hughes at about $15 billion -- nearly triple 
what GM paid a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Those figures no doubt mean Armstrong is being amply rewarded. Although GM 
Hughes doesn't disclose his salary, his compensation probably tops $1 million a 
year -- based on what other defense executives earn. He leases a house in 
Manhattan Beach, but his main home is in Darien, Conn. He owns property in 
Naples, Fla., and is building a house in Telluride, Colo., where he can satisfy 
passions for tennis and skiing. 
</P>
<P>
 At other times, Armstrong takes one of his two Harley-Davidson motorcycles for 
long drives in the country. "It's the escape," he said. "It's wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Armstrong arrived at Hughes, he knew little of missiles or satellites. 
But Hughes coveted his ability to lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in October, 1938, Armstrong is the oldest of three sons whose father sold 
electronics goods. He attended Miami University of Ohio on a football 
scholarship. After a shoulder injury, he lost his scholarship and took odd jobs 
to finish school. He earned a bachelor's degree in business economics in 1961, 
and that year he married his high-school sweetheart and went to work as an IBM 
salesman in Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 He eventually headed IBM's personal computer group and, by 1989, its global 
operations. But by 1991, he could see he would not succeed John Akers as 
chairman, because they were close in age. Coincidentally, Hughes had hired a 
headhunter, E. Pendleton James, to find Currie's replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes "needed somebody who could change it as the world and technology and 
markets were changing," James said. "Hughes has never been known as a marketing 
company," but Armstrong "had been marketing throughout the world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marketing is also the base under the public soapbox on which Armstrong stands 
so frequently. Reforming state government. Urging Clinton against sanctions. 
They all effectively are marketing tools he uses to bolster Hughes' business. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Armstrong admits to one episode when he used Hughes' influence to 
manipulate the media and, in turn, hold a spotlight on one of the company's 
concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Speculation was rampant last year that Hughes would leave its headquarters in 
the Westchester bluffs near Culver City, and move out of state. In truth, 
Hughes merely wanted to sell the building and move into one of its other Los 
Angeles-area facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Hughes found it could not sell the building and, meanwhile, state 
leaders made progress reforming California's workers' compensation system, and 
delivered a budget on time. 
</P>
<P>
 So Armstrong had an idea: He would announce Hughes was staying in its 
headquarters as a way to publicly applaud the government's reforms. And when he 
held the news conference last September, Gov. Wilson, Speaker Brown and several 
other state lawmakers stood next to Armstrong to drive home his message. 
</P>
<P>
 "In that case you can accuse us of staging something for press purposes," 
Armstrong said, "because we wanted to reinforce the political system's change . 
. . to give it support." 
</P>
<P>
 The people who need Armstrong's support today are his employees. He travels to 
Hughes plants at least twice a month to give his workers pep talks and remind 
them yet again of Hughes' new customer-is-king approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to stay in touch" with the workers, he said to a visitor joining him 
on a trip this spring to Hughes' 7,000-worker missile factory in Tucson. 
Munching a tuna sandwich and crackers while flying to Arizona on one of Hughes' 
private jets, Armstrong said his visits are meant to "let them put their fears 
and anxieties and their questions directly" to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Which they do. Asked whether he would buy a house in Tucson if he were a 
Hughes employee working there, Armstrong replied that the firm "just invested a 
whole ton of money to make Tucson a focal point of our company." 
</P>
<P>
 The translation seemed to be, yes, he would buy the house. But a few weeks 
later, Hughes disclosed the potential for more layoffs in Tucson -- underlining 
how workers can take nothing for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, that might be Armstrong's desire. It is his goal for Hughes' work 
force to finish one contract as efficiently as possible, then hustle for the 
next one as if Hughes' survival depended on it. 
</P>
<P>
 For all of Armstrong's success, the conventional wisdom is that he is not the 
prototype chief executive for the defense industry in the 21st Century -- at 
least not yet. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason: Few defense firms are pursuing commercial ventures as aggressively 
as Hughes, so outsiders with a flair for marketing are not in great demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense is "a fairly insular industry," said Quarterdeck's Kutler. "In a lot 
of ways you can look at Hughes and Armstrong as a successful experiment. But it 
may well be the only one." Profile: C. Michael Armstrong

NEWS ANALYSIS; ' VIVA CASTRO!' FADING INTO ' ADIOS, CUBA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM D. MONTALBANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She brought high birth, wit, idealism, beauty and firebrand energy to a 
revolution that she believed would build a better Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, near 60, she is a senior official in a government ministry. Watching the 
plight of her country, and the sea flight of its people that continued unabated 
Wednesday, is more than depressing. She feels violated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am lost. I gave my youth, my life. What is there to show for it? To what 
should I aspire now? To be able to one day shop again in a store?" she asked 
amid the faded splendor of a once-elegant living room. 
</P>
<P>
 With a new exodus adding insult to the injury of decades of political 
stagnation and economic failure, illusion and commitment are ebbing fast in the 
country that proudly proclaimed social revolution as the cardinal national 
ethic for 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody believes anything anymore; people don't see any future," the official 
said, staring vacantly at an armchair two generations overdue for 
reupholstering. 
</P>
<P>
 Makeshift rafts floating off to sea on a keel and a prayer with each new tide 
harden the winter of a patriarch. Even for Cubans who have long supported the 
revolution, there is an empty ring now to Fidel Castro's claim to a moral high 
ground over empty materialism and Yanqui imperialism. 
</P>
<P>
 One by one, hallmark gains of Castro's revolution are unraveling in hardship 
and disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cuban love of laughter and the absurd lives on: This week as thousands of 
rafters were plucked from the sea, the movie at the landmark Cine Yara in 
downtown Havana was "Night of the Sharks." 
</P>
<P>
 But if there is a line between principled poverty and squalor, time-warp 
Havana has crossed it. The empty shops, empty streets and general dilapidation 
of the Cuban capital are well-known, however shocking their Bronx-like 
desolation. What is newer are the empty faces, the defeated eyes, the crowds of 
young men and women with nothing to do, the apparent absence of productive 
activity except around tourist areas, where there is an unseemly scramble for 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "After so many years, I feel betrayed. We believed, we worked, we volunteered. 
For nothing. These are evil times," an old man said. Call him Eugenio: Twenty 
years ago, as a teacher proclaimed as a heroic worker, he was allowed to buy a 
car. Today, unable to live on his pension, Eugenio spends his days around 
tourist hotels, hoping a visitor will hire him and his rattletrap for dollars 
to tour the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro came to power with a clean broom he wielded fiercely against social 
ills that flourished under the dictatorship he toppled. Vowing to build a just, 
moral society, he righteously warred on crime and corruption, and virtually 
wiped out prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-five years later, in the umpteenth period of economic emergency, they 
have all returned to Havana with a vengeance. Residents habitually warn 
visitors against muggers and pickpockets. Beggars come in dazzling variety, 
from whining grandmothers -- "One little dollar, my child" -- to street kids 
who curse with polish, in English, once their requests are denied. 
</P>
<P>
 The casinos of dictator Fulgencio Batista's day remain closed, and parents say 
drugs are not a problem, but naughty Havana is back. There are not many traffic 
lights on the dark road from the airport to town, but prostitutes troll for 
dollars at every one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 There are images seemingly reborn from another time: a teen-age cop fondling 
an even younger prostitute on a downtown street. It is like the old days but 
with modern conveniences: A tourist jetting in for a few days, no questions 
asked, finds the air conditioning pumping in his hotel room and the TV showing 
a preseason football game between the Broncos and the Cowboys. At the hotel bar 
a friendly senorita in brown lipstick and a gamin haircut arrives 
simultaneously with a cold imported beer. 
</P>
<P>
 In practical terms, Cuban pesos are worthless, so everybody cheats to earn 
dollars. Waiters at state-run restaurants are no longer surly; they live for 
dollar tips. Official receipts are hard things to find in tourist Havana; not 
everything that crosses the bar reaches the till. 
</P>
<P>
 One rafter waiting to leave this week said he had supported himself for months 
as a middleman for a friend who sold cigars from a state factory and the street 
people who sold them to tourists. A $15 taxi ride to the airport will buy as 
many pesos as the driver earns legally in a year. The next step is not hard to 
figure out. 
</P>
<P>
 The disconnection of government and people is, by now, notorious. Amid an 
exodus that represents for Cuba a mortifying hemorrhage of its young people, 
government press organs natter on about increased electric production, 
high-yield cows and important new trade ties with Namibia. On Wednesday, the 
Communist Party newspaper lauded 244 selfless women who were given medals for 
their contribution to the revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 "When some believe they are witnessing the death of hope, we Cuban women feel 
ever stronger faith in the revolution," said central committee member Yolanda 
Ferrer, hailing "fidelity to our principles, the confidence in our party, in 
our Fidel, the certainty that we deserve and will win victory." 
</P>
<P>
 What is particularly painful to those who once believed is that it is the 
children of the revolution who are leaving: The overwhelming majority of 
rafters were born in Cuba after Castro took power in 1959 and have spent their 
lives listening to propaganda praising the revolution and assailing the United 
States. It didn't work. 
</P>
<P>
 "You couldn't pay me to leave on a raft," said one government worker, "but I 
can understand why people are going. In 1980, when many left, things were 
better here than they are today and all we heard was how badly Cubans lived in 
the U.S. Imagine how we feel when those 1980 people come back here now as rich 
tourists and say, ' Chico , what are you doing, still stuck in a place going 
backward?' " 
</P>
<P>
 If the economic distress that drives the new exodus is Castro's work, so is 
the caliber of people who are leaving. If there are misfits among them, they 
are not conspicuous on getaway beaches around the capital. 
</P>
<P>
 In the main, the rafters seem precisely the same sort of ambitious, ingenious, 
good-with-their-hands, want-to-work, take-a-chance folk who built the country 
to which they are fleeing. 
</P>
<P>
 The rafters say they are hungry, and they are nearly all thin by U.S. 
standards. But they seem in amazingly good physical shape. It would be 
fascinating to know who would prove essentially healthier in a doctor's eyes: 
sun-hardened, bike-riding refugees from Castro's rationed economy or their 
eat-everything, drive-everywhere, air-conditioned Miami cousins. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the haunted eyes of the woman mourning her revolution, the most 
powerful impression that lingers with a visitor to the beaches this week is the 
force with which Cubans are thrusting themselves to sea. A hurricane might stay 
their flight. Or an about-face by Castro, closing the doors. But nothing that 
Washington can do, short of letting people drown.

WHITE HOUSE SEES CHANCES FADING FOR ACTION ON HEALTH; LEGISLATION: 
ADMINISTRATION TAKES MEASURES TO REVIVE DEBATE IN NEXT CONGRESS, SOURCES SAY. 
CLINTON REMAINS DETERMINED NOT TO SETTLE FOR HALF STEPS ON REFORM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER and EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The White House is nearing the conclusion that action on meaningful health 
care reform is all but impossible this year and has begun laying the groundwork 
for moving the debate into the next session of Congress, according to 
Administration and congressional sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though officials continue to voice hope that Senate leaders can craft a 
workable compromise from two competing health care reform plans, time and 
tempers are growing short on Capitol Hill. The House already has left town 
after its rancorous debate on the crime bill, which is now stalled in the 
Senate, and there has been virtually no progress in recent weeks toward 
consensus on health care. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton remains determined not to settle for half steps on health 
care, which he believes may do more harm than good and doom chances for the 
sweeping reformation of the American health care system that he wants. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the Senate can surmount numerous obstacles in the next few days and 
produce a bipartisan plan that makes significant progress toward universal 
health care coverage, the White House is prepared reluctantly to call it quits 
for this year, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has discussed the prospect of suspending the health care debate until 
next year with several influential senators who share his concern about the 
chances of passing an even minimally acceptable bill this year. 
</P>
<P>
 And if Clinton's push for health care reform fails this year, aides are 
already planning how to present to the public the defeat of Clinton's central 
political promise and to contain the damage to the Clinton presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House is expected to argue that health reform is not dead and that 
it will be revived when the next Congress convenes in January. Although the new 
Congress likely will have considerably more Republicans in both chambers than 
the current one, officials said that any health plan will require bipartisan 
support and fresh Republican minds may make the task easier rather than more 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has repeatedly made the point in public that the "Brady bill" 
handgun-control measure took seven years to enact, anti-crime legislation has 
been pending for six years and the Americans With Disabilities Act required 
five years for passage. 
</P>
<P>
 An initiative as ambitious as the reform of one-seventh of the American 
economy cannot be expected to be implemented overnight, Clinton has said. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House is expected to attack congressional Republicans for blocking 
the Administration's health care plan and to challenge House and Senate GOP 
leaders to come up with a plan for providing health coverage for all Americans 
-- or explain why they are against it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration pitch will also cite substantial progress toward its goal: 
Health reform is now on the national front burner and the public expects 
action, the chief problems have been identified and countless hours have been 
spent drafting legislation and analyzing the benefits and liabilities of 
various proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has said that, in all the debate over the various health plans now 
before Congress, his basic position has not changed. He is for comprehensive 
health benefits for all Americans, provided by private insurers and paid for 
through employer and worker contributions and savings from the existing system. 
</P>
<P>
 Anything less will not satisfy him and he would rather continue the debate 
next year than sign a bill that falls short of his fundamental goals, he 
insisted again Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are asking me where I am, I am still where I always was," Clinton told 
the international convention of B'nai B'rith in Chicago in a satellite hookup. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main thing we must do is we must do something that will work and it will 
be better not to do anything at all than to adopt a program that would actually 
increase costs of health care and reduce coverage. That's what we don't want to 
do," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials concede that the prospects for action this year are 
growing dimmer by the day. Even upbeat public pronouncements are qualified now. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether Clinton expects an acceptable bill this year, White House Press 
Secretary Dee Dee Myers said Wednesday: "Well, I think he's hopeful as he has 
been throughout this process. Certainly it's difficult. He knew from the 
beginning it would be very, very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Harold M. Ickes, the White House deputy chief of staff who is overseeing 
health care strategy, insisted in an interview with wire service reporters that 
"health care is alive and well," despite the assertion Tuesday by House Speaker 
Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) that Congress was unlikely to enact anything beyond 
incremental health insurance reforms this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the predictions that this is going to be shut down are -- there's no 
basis for that," Ickes said. But, he acknowledged, "there's no question that 
the clock is running against us." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, members of the bipartisan "mainstream" coalition and their 
aides continued meeting throughout the day, putting the finishing touches on a 
plan that they intend to be an alternative to the bill proposed by Majority 
Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.). 
</P>
<P>
 One coalition member, Sen. David L. Boren (D-Okla.), said late Wednesday 
afternoon that the group expected to finish its work Wednesday night in time to 
send the proposal to the Congressional Budget Office for analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 As the group of about 20 senators and their staffs worked in a stuffy room 
just off the Capitol Rotunda, members were grimly aware that the window of 
opportunity for enacting health reform was closing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting late," said Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum (R-Kan.). 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Bob Kerrey (D-Neb.) added: "I think we're within a few days of just 
putting the whole health care issue to bed for the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) agreed with that assessment. 
"Time is ticking away," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from substantive differences between the "mainstream" coalition plan and 
Mitchell's, another potential obstacle toward some compromise is that most of 
the bipartisan group members are insisting that their plan be, in Kassebaum's 
words, "a separate package." 
</P>
<P>
 By that, they mean that they want their proposal to be considered as an 
alternative to Mitchell's. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell's bill, backed by the White House, aims to attain 95% coverage by the 
year 2000, relying on voluntary measures and a variety of insurance reforms and 
subsidies to the needy. It would trigger an employer mandate by 2002 in states 
that do not achieve 95% coverage, requiring large businesses to pay at least 
50% of a worker's premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 The "mainstream" coalition's plan, unveiled Friday evening, eliminates the 
employer mandate altogether and would trim $400 billion from future growth of 
Medicare and Medicaid over 10 years to generate funds to help poor people buy 
health insurance. It aims for about 91% coverage by the year 2002. 
</P>
<P>
 Both plans call for a number of insurance market reforms, barring insurers 
from denying or canceling coverage on the basis of a customer's health. All 
health plans would be available to all applicants and policy renewals would be 
guaranteed. 
</P>
<P>
 The discussion over the next few days will hinge on whether the coalition bill 
can be combined in some way with the Mitchell plan into a coherent package 
acceptable to a majority in the Senate and to Clinton. On that effort hangs the 
fate of health reform this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all a judgment call by the Democratic leadership," said Sen. Dave 
Durenberger (R-Minn.).

SEN. ROGERS DEFENDS TALK TO GROUP ACCUSED OF RACISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CYNTHIA H. CRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State Sen. Don Rogers, under fire for his plans to address an organization 
accused of holding white supremacist beliefs, dismissed the criticism 
Wednesday, saying the group was composed of "patriotic Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers, a Republican who represents portions of the Antelope Valley, said he 
accepted an invitation to speak at a dinner Saturday night during the Jubilee 
newspaper's fourth annual conference in Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the watchdog group Coalition for Human Dignity, the 
California-based Jubilee is the leading national publication of the Christian 
Identity movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Followers believe that white northern European descendants are superior to 
other races and often refer to people of color as "mud people," said Noah 
Chandler, a spokesman for the Center for Democratic Renewal, which tracks the 
religious right. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining Rogers in the lineup of speakers will be Louis Beam Jr., a former 
leader of the Texas Ku Klux Klan and an Aryan Nations organizer who is also a 
staff writer for the Jubilee. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys are just hate mongers, and it's an absolute disgrace for a 
California state senator to be speaking to such a group," said the Rev. Jerry 
Sloan of the Sacramento-based Project Tocsin, which also monitors the religious 
right. "The people with whom he is breaking bread may be Christian, but they 
are definitely also white supremacists." 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers said he does not share the views of white supremacists and plans to 
speak only of a Senate resolution he authored to reaffirm state and individual 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "My impression of the Jubilee people is that they are a group of patriotic 
Americans who are working to preserve and restore individual rights and 
freedoms," Rogers said, adding he knows nothing about charges that the group 
promotes racism. 
</P>
<P>
 Jubilee representatives did not return phone calls Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 This will not be the first time Rogers has attended one of the group's annual 
gatherings. Two years ago, the senator spoke against gun control and 
environmentalists at a conference in Mariposa, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 A May-June, 1992, edition of Jubilee heralded Rogers for his talk and praised 
him for never voting for a tax increase. The same issue carried an article 
describing the Los Angeles riots as "savage and senseless Negro attacks on 
White persons . . . and massive looting by Latinos who swarmed into shattered 
buildings as mad dogs attacking a helpless lamb." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jubilee maintained in that edition that its stance on race superiority was 
exaggerated by a biased media. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, Beam, a former grand dragon of the Ku Klux Klan in Texas, was ordered 
by a court to cease harassing Vietnamese shrimp fishermen in Galveston. Five 
years later, he led racist skinheads in an Aryan Nations march in Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers, who represents portions of Kern, Inyo, San Bernardino and Los Angeles 
counties, said he is only interested in finding supporters to back his 
resolution underscoring the U. S. Constitution's 10th Amendment, which says the 
federal government cannot force unreasonable mandates on states. 
</P>
<P>
 A veteran of battles with the federal government over payment of back taxes, 
Rogers is a fierce believer in individual rights. He consistently ranks among 
the state Senate's most conservative members. 
</P>
<P>
 The 66-year-old legislator, with two years remaining in the Senate before term 
limits force him out, also authored a separate resolution to reaffirm 
Californians' right to bear arms. A resolution is non-binding and does not 
carry the force of law. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am the captain of my ship. I set the agenda," Rogers said. "If someone 
wants to come on board my ship and support my issue, they are welcome to do so, 
but they abide by my rules. This does not mean that I support their position." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with Rogers' firm denial that he shares in any racist beliefs, his 
appearance before Jubilee supporters is nonetheless damaging, said Robert 
Crawford of the Coalition for Human Dignity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main thing is a lot of these groups reach out to public officials or 
people with a broader public base to legitimize themselves," Crawford said. "It 
lends them a legitimacy that they don't otherwise have access to in spreading 
their anti-Semitic and racist pseudo-religious ideas."

 Ten-year-old Maria Gomez pulled at her school uniform, a navy jumper with a 
blue bow at the neck, and complained. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wear it because my mom makes me," she said. "It's too hot." 
</P>
<P>
 But Abram Santos said he wants to fit in at Sepulveda Elementary School, so he 
wears a uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom says it looks nice," said Abram, 6, a second-grader who wore navy 
pants, a white, buttoned-down shirt and blue tie to school Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, the Santa Ana campus looks like a parochial school, with girls 
wearing navy skirts or jumpers with white blouses and boys in slacks or shorts 
with white shirts. But these uniforms are optional; students also can wear 
their overalls or jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 At some public schools in California, students may not have that choice next 
year. A new state law, signed by Gov. Pete Wilson on Tuesday, will allow school 
districts to require students to wear uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of schools throughout the state, including about 50 in Orange County, 
already have voluntary uniforms. And school districts around the nation are 
taking a serious look at what might have been unthinkable before the era of 
gang colors. 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Ana, 26 of the district's 30 elementary schools have optional 
uniforms, including Pio Pico Elementary, the county's vanguard three years ago 
when it first tried the idea. Parents' enthusiasm spurred other schools like 
Sepulveda to give the polyester pants and cotton shirts a try. 
</P>
<P>
 Sepulveda students have mixed opinions about the uniforms, which have been an 
option there for about a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like them because I don't have to worry about getting my clothes dirty," 
said Keslynn Velasco, 6, who wore a navy blue jumpsuit and white blouse 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 First-grade teacher Connie McWhorter said uniforms make her students feel like 
they belong in school. 
</P>
<P>
 "They identify their uniforms with being students," McWhorter said. "Firemen 
wear firemen's uniforms, police officers wear police uniforms. They see school 
uniforms and say, 'This is a student, and that's their job.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But older Sepulveda elementary students, like 10-year-old Jasmin Bahena, 
aren't sold. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like them, because we don't get to wear our normal clothes," Bahena 
said, wearing denim shorts and a pink top. 
</P>
<P>
 Maribel Mendoza, also 10, conceded that uniforms prevent students from wearing 
clothing signifying gangs, "but that doesn't stop people in gangs. They're 
still in a gang even though they have a uniform," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the law, which takes effect Jan. 1, district officials who want to 
require uniforms must talk to principals, teachers and parents before choosing 
the outfits. 
</P>
<P>
 If a district or school decides to adopt uniforms, administrators must tell 
parents six months in advance. Children of parents who object on religious or 
moral grounds may be exempted, and each school or district must create its own 
rules for giving those children alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who cannot afford a uniform must be provided one by their school. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators of the Santa Ana Unified School District said they don't see 
any changes ahead for their voluntary policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pleased with the progress at our schools on a voluntary basis," interim 
Santa Ana Supt. Don Champlin said. 
</P>
<P>
 But at least one school in Orange County may adopt a mandatory uniform policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Superintendent James A. Fleming said he expects that Philip J. Reilly 
Elementary School in Mission Viejo, the only school in the Capistrano Unified 
School District that currently has a voluntary uniforms policy, will make them 
mandatory. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other schools, Aliso Niguel High School and new Wood Canyon Elementary 
School, are considering them on a voluntary basis, Fleming said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I anticipate that with the passage of that law, you will see significant 
movement in my district and other districts toward a uniform policy," Fleming 
said. "It helps change behavior and stops competition about who is wearing the 
latest fashions." 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach apparently will become the first major U.S. city to make the 
uniform standard dress for its 57,000 students in public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Marquez, principal of Long Beach's Whittier Elementary School, which has 
been experimenting with voluntary uniforms for the past five years, is a 
believer. 
</P>
<P>
 During that time, the school, located in an economically depressed part of the 
city, has gradually improved in a number of academic areas. And it was 
announced this week that Whittier had the smallest absentee rate of Long 
Beach's 82 schools. She attributes part of that success to the uniforms, which 
she said makes for a much more even playing field when it comes to clothes. And 
there is no confusion about a child unwittingly wearing gang colors to school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parents are pleased to have something worn that can't be mistaken for 
gang attire," she said. "The teachers are very happy with it, that kids come to 
school ready to learn. No one thing is going to fix everything, but it is an 
important step in making the students feel like they are a part of things." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that all are in agreement about the value of the uniform. Some, for 
instance, complain about the cash outlay for the special clothes, while others 
say they stifle the creativity of the children. The American Civil Liberties 
Union, and Long Beach student Andrew Tully, have come out against uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want the freedom of what I wear," said Tully, 10, eating his lunch in a 
bright colored T-shirt and shorts. "It's my First Amendment right." 
</P>
<P>
 But Diane Fike, said she was glad her youngest son, a fourth-grader, would be 
surrounded by navy and white. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is a safety issue," Fike said. "People in the community can really 
watch out for these kids when they're in uniform," she said. "Plus, I do think 
it's a social equalizer." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the students' gripes were to be expected: "Kids are going to want to 
do what they want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Kirk Tyler, the 13-year-old Student Council President at Mary Butler, said he 
was wearing his uniform now -- but doing it reluctantly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to learn if I'm going to learn," he said. "The clothes can't tell 
you that you're going to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Mitchell, the dean of the UCLA School of Education, praised both the new 
law and Long Beach in particular. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sort of an inoculation against controversy," he said of the new law. 
</P>
<P>
 One other point on the question of uniforms: sales are brisk for uniforms in 
Long Beach, while sales of other clothing is predictably down. Melissa Salazar, 
an employee at one of three Long beach Target stores, said they were selling 
hundreds of uniforms a day. Meanwhile, a manager of Chaktomouk fashions, which 
sells children's clothes in Long beach, said sales were down by about $50 a 
day.

METROLINK TRAIN HITS CAR; 4 KILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Three adults and a baby girl were killed Wednesday night when their car spun 
out of control at a Riverside railroad crossing and careened into the path of a 
Metrolink commuter train, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash -- the second Metrolink accident this month to end in tragedy -- 
occurred at 6:39 p.m., just four minutes before the train was scheduled to 
complete its run from Downtown Los Angeles, said Metrolink spokesman Peter 
Hidalgo. 
</P>
<P>
 The identities of the victims -- a male driver and his three female passengers 
-- were not immediately known. None of the 100 passengers aboard the train were 
injured, Hidalgo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside Police Sgt. Bob Hanson said the accident happened at the Jurupa Road 
rail crossing in Riverside, "right about sunset when the sun was very strong." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson said the westbound Oldsmobile had swerved to avoid rear-ending a car in 
front of it, which had stopped abruptly when the crossing gate dropped at the 
intersection. Out of control, the swerving vehicle crashed through the gate and 
onto the tracks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the 400-ton locomotive hit the car at a speed of about 60 
m.p.h., hurling it about 250 feet and killing everyone inside. 
</P>
<P>
 The deaths brought Metrolink-related fatalities to 25 since the service's 
inception in 1992. Hidalgo said 13 of the deaths occurred this year. About half 
of them have been suicides, he said. Most of the remainder happened when 
motorists and pedestrians tried to beat a train across the tracks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 15, three people were killed when they tried to take a shortcut across 
a Metrolink track in Glendale. Officials said the victims -- a 7-year-old girl, 
her mother and her grandfather -- apparently ignored or did not hear the 
warning blasts from the oncoming train.

CAPITOL JOURNAL: WILSON'S VIEW OF A 2ND TERM AS HE TURNS 61 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was Gov. Pete Wilson's 61st birthday Tuesday, but governors don't really 
get to celebrate such milestones, not in a normal sense. Especially if they're 
in a tight race for reelection. They're leery of taking any R & R for fear of 
losing a step to the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that this governor couldn't use some rest. Aides say he survives on four 
to five hours sleep a night and is prone to calling them at any hour. The 
failure to recharge leaves him sometimes running only on adrenaline and 
delivering long-winded, rambling speeches. And by the look of his ashen face, 
it's obvious his only outdoor recreation is photo-ops. 
</P>
<P>
 But he's "healthy as an ox," advisers say. He exercises indoors. And by the 
look in his eyes, it's clear there's energy to burn and an unflinching focus on 
the main target: reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 So on this birthday, he'd make do with the presentation of a chocolate cake 
and bottle of Cakebread Cabernet from the legislative leaders, a surprise 
arranged by Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco). "My leadership 
buddies," the governor deadpanned later. That night, he'd fly to Del Mar 
racetrack for a birthday dinner with 650 of his closest friends who could 
contribute $250 apiece to his campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 And his staff would book him for lunch at a popular capital restaurant 
(Dawson's) with a columnist who wanted to ask what a second term might be like. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There were a lot of "Hi, how are ya's" from surprised lobbyists as the 
governor walked across the street and was seated at a back corner table. In 
summary, this is what he said between sips of a nonalcoholic beer and bites of 
a Caesar salad with crab meat: 
</P>
<P>
 Water (California's biggest perennial problem, but an issue being ignored) -- 
In a second term, he'd try to get agriculture, urban users and 
environmentalists "to make some sense" and compromise. "We're going to continue 
to grow, whether anybody likes it or not. The need will increase for water." 
The solution is conservation, more off-stream storage reservoirs and the 
ability to privately sell water. It's also "probably true" there needs to be a 
better way of moving water through the Delta. But he doesn't seem ready to 
fight for a controversial Peripheral Canal. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists -- The "least realistic" among them are "willing to allow 
the Endangered Species Act to divert" water from farming and industry. "Honest 
science" is needed to determine exactly what's required to save a "significant 
species." And he distinguishes between significant (such as salmon) and 
insignificant, saying, "One of the candidates (for protection) that seriously 
threatens jobs in the Central Valley is the fairy shrimp. It's about a 
centimeter long. It's found in drainage ditches in 23 counties. Now, for that 
to interfere with development or grazing raises serious questions about whether 
people are rational. I'm sure it's part of somebody's food chain, but. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Taxes -- He "absolutely" won't raise taxes ever again. "You don't have to read 
my lips, read history." Since 1991, when he raised taxes to balance a 
recession-plagued budget, he's opposed all tax hikes. In fact, "it's fairly 
likely" there could be a tax cut "because I'm convinced we're going to see a 
tremendous increase in employment." 
</P>
<P>
 Business -- He'd push bills to "undo the regulatory excess." California needs 
to get more competitive "so we can increase revenues and make investments in 
education and public safety, the two essentials." 
</P>
<P>
 Schools/Crime -- The worst classroom culprit is lack of parental motivation, 
which is "much more important than money." Too often this results from teen 
pregnancy and babies reared without fathers. "There's no civilizing, 
socializing influence. . . . The 14-year-old mothers produce 16-year-old 
predators. Gang members." He already has provided welfare bonuses for teen 
mothers who stay in school and penalties for those who don't. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to know what I want to do in a second term? A dozen things. But I 
tell you what we have got to do because it's at the root. . . . Teen pregnancy 
can lead to a career on welfare and a gang member-son . . . a major cost in 
human suffering and dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We also naturally talked about the governor's enemy : Treasurer Kathleen 
Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "She seems phony," he said. "She's sent very mixed signals. She's trying to 
sound like me. But she lacks credentials. She has no record in law enforcement, 
no record in. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Wait. Ronald Reagan also had no record when he ran against Pat Brown in 1966. 
"But he was offering people a clear choice," Wilson said, "and running against 
an honest liberal, who, unlike his children, never professed to be anything but 
a liberal." 
</P>
<P>
 I was tempted to ask about Brown's charges of broken promises in his first 
term. But that could wait. Even a governor deserves some break on his birthday.

SEX HARASSMENT SUIT NAMES AREIAS, CHIEF AIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A legislative aide alleges in a lawsuit that Assemblyman Rusty Areias ignored 
sexual harassment complaints she lodged against his chief of staff and that the 
San Jose Democrat later threatened her with the loss of her job if she pursued 
the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Simpson, a former Areias administrative aide who still is employed by 
the Assembly, leveled the allegations in a sexual harassment suit filed in 
Sacramento Superior Court against the veteran legislator and his chief of 
staff, John Barry Wyatt. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson also contends that Wyatt made "unwelcome sexual advances" and that 
Wyatt and Areias maintained a hostile workplace environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Areias, who in June lost a bid for state controller, and Wyatt deny any 
wrongdoing. They said the Assembly Rules Committee has found the charges to be 
without merit. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Terry McHale, an Areias spokesman, called the charges in the 
suit "false and ugly," adding that "Rusty was never told at any time that 
Debbie had any complaints of being harassed." 
</P>
<P>
 With sexual harassment becoming increasingly unacceptable in the private 
workplace, more legislators are also being hit with complaints. Simpson's suit 
was filed last Friday, just a few days before a sexual harassment lawsuit 
against Assemblyman Mickey Conroy, an Orange County Republican, came to light. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months ago, four former staff members alleged that Assemblyman Tom 
Connolly made boorish and harassing statements about sexuality. But the 
Assembly Rules Committee determined the charges against the Lemon Grove 
Democrat were without merit, according to Bob Connelly, the panel's chief 
administrative officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Connelly said that in his eight years as the panel's administrator, about four 
harassment complaints have been filed, including three within the last few 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Cliff Berg, Senate Rules Committee executive officer, said he is 
unaware of any similar claims filed against senators. 
</P>
<P>
 Until relatively recently, both houses of the Legislature were almost 
exclusive men's clubs. With women now representing more than 20 of the 
Assembly's 80 seats, female employees may feel more comfortable about coming 
forward and accusing their bosses of misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do know from talking to my client that there is a lot of intimidation that 
goes on over there," said Simpson's attorney, Curtis S. Leavitt of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, 39, a longtime Sacramento resident, worked for Areias for nearly five 
years, starting as a secretary and ending as an administrative assistant before 
being sent off to the Assembly's secretarial pool earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the action, which seeks unspecified damages, Simpson contends Wyatt 
subjected her "to continued unwelcomed sexual advances," which she rejected. 
She alleges that Wyatt sought to touch her in an inappropriate manner, yelled 
at her in public using obscene terms and described his own sexual exploits. 
</P>
<P>
 In one alleged instance last April, Wyatt drove Simpson to her home but then 
allegedly walked into her home uninvited and grabbed Simpson, pulling her down 
on top of him. He allegedly kept Simpson down for about 30 minutes while 
kissing and fondling Simpson against her will. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson said she reported the incidents to Areias, who retaliated by 
questioning her qualifications "and by insinuating" she might lose her job. 
After filing a complaint with the Rules Committee, Simpson said she was demoted 
to the secretarial pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Areias could not be reached for comment. In an interview, Wyatt said he and 
Areias deny the charges, maintaining that the Rules Committee found them 
groundless -- an assertion disputed by Simpson's lawyer.

OFFICIALS ERRED BY 3 YEARS ON ARIS' PAROLE DATE; PRISON: RELEASE OF WOMAN WHO 
KILLED HER HUSBAND AFTER YEARS OF ABUSE IS SET FOR DECEMBER, 1998, INSTEAD OF 
1995. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 State parole officials on Wednesday said they miscalculated the parole date 
set for convicted murderer Brenda Aris, who killed her husband after enduring 
years of abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Aris has been given a parole date of Dec. 13, 1998, said Theodore Rich, 
executive officer of the Board of Prison Terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich said Aris will be eligible to shave 18 months off that release date for 
good behavior if she maintains a clean prison record between now and 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Rich had said Aris was given a parole date of Dec. 18, 1995. He 
now says that figure was wrong because of a calculation error made by a records 
clerk at the California Institution for Women at Frontera. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a tremendous amount of interest in this case," Rich said. 
"Everybody wanted to be as helpful and as accommodating as possible, and an 
error was made." 
</P>
<P>
 Rich said the official record of the hearing will reflect the correct release 
date for Aris. 
</P>
<P>
 Aris is the first convicted murderer in California to win leniency based on a 
claim that she was battered by her husband before killing him. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson, after reviewing the record in Aris' case, last year commuted 
her minimum sentence from 15 years to life to 12 years to life. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Prison Terms, however, decided to set Aris' sentence based on the 
original minimum of 15 years, which is a longer sentence than Wilson's action 
would have permitted but a shorter one than most second-degree murderers 
receive. If she is released in 1998, she will have spent 11 years in custody, 
which was reduced from 15 because of good conduct in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Aris' lawyer, Chee Davis of Los Angeles, said Wednesday that this is the 
second time her client's hopes for an early release have been raised and then 
dashed by the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said Aris was told in 1993 after Wilson's decision that she was to be 
released immediately, but after packing and giving away some personal 
belongings she was stopped at the prison gates and kept in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a terrible tragedy," Davis said. "I don't understand why this is so 
difficult for people who have all the information. They have the data. Brenda 
doesn't. I don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Aris' mother, Iona Lane, sobbed when told that her daughter would have to 
spend more time in prison than she had been led to believe. 
</P>
<P>
 "My daughter's been through enough," Lane said in a telephone interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis said the release date suggests that the parole board disregarded 
Wilson's recommendation that Aris be given leniency because of the abuse she 
suffered from her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 But James Nielsen, chairman of the Board of Prison Terms, said the board's 
three-member panel did take Aris' claim of battered women's syndrome into 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 He said it is unusual for inmates to receive a parole date at their first 
hearing, as Aris did. And he said the panel knocked two years off the minimum 
sentence of 17 years that it normally would have given an inmate convicted of 
second-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Nielsen said, the panel decided to allow Aris to reduce her remaining 
time in prison by half, rather than only one-third, for good behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question that the battered women's issue was a very significant 
factor," Nielsen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel's decision is subject to review by Wilson, who can let it stand or 
modify it. The parole board also may change its decision between now and the 
conclusion of Aris' term, Nielsen said, which could result in her getting out 
of prison earlier.

SENATOR DEFENDS SPEECH BEFORE ALLEGED WHITE SUPREMACISTS; POLITICS: DON ROGERS 
SAYS BAKERSFIELD GATHERING IS FOR 'PATRIOTIC AMERICANS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 State Sen. Don Rogers, under fire for his plans to address an organization 
accused of white supremacist beliefs, dismissed the criticism Wednesday, saying 
that as far as he is concerned the group consists of "patriotic Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican from Tehachapi, who consistently ranks among the state Senate's 
most conservative members, says he accepted an invitation to speak at a dinner 
Saturday night during the fourth annual Jubilation Celebration and Conference 
in Bakersfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Joining him in the lineup of speakers is Louis Beam Jr., a former Ku Klux Klan 
member from Texas and an Aryan Nations organizer who is also a staff writer for 
the California-based Jubilee newspaper, which is sponsoring the weekend event. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers says he does not share the views of white supremacists and plans to 
speak only on a Senate resolution he authored to reaffirm state and individual 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "My impression of the Jubilee people is that they are a group of patriotic 
Americans who are working to preserve and restore individual rights and 
freedoms," Rogers said, adding that he knows nothing about charges that the 
group promotes racism. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Oregon-based watchdog group Coalition for Human Dignity, the 
Jubilee is the leading national publication of the Christian Identity movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Followers believe that white Northern European descendants are superior to 
other races and often refer to people of color as "mud people," said Noah 
Chandler, a spokesman for the Center for Democratic Renewal, an Atlanta-based 
group that tracks the religious right. 
</P>
<P>
 Jubilee representatives did not return phone calls seeking comment Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 This will not be the first time Rogers has attended one of the group's annual 
Jubilation gatherings. Two years ago, the senator spoke against gun control and 
environmentalists at a conference in Mariposa. 
</P>
<P>
 The May-June, 1992, edition of Jubilee heralded Rogers for his talk and 
praised him for never voting for a tax increase. The same issue carried an 
article describing the Los Angeles riots as "savage and senseless Negro attacks 
on white persons . . . and massive looting by Latinos who swarmed into 
shattered buildings as mad dogs attacking a helpless lamb." 
</P>
<P>
 Jubilee writers also said that their conference had not turned into a 
rollicking hate fest, as local sheriff's deputies apparently had feared, but 
was a quiet, family-oriented event. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Jubilee maintained in that edition that its stance on race 
superiority has been overstated in local newspapers, it counts a prominent 
organizer of the white supremacist movement -- Beam -- among its staff writers. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, Beam, a former grand dragon of the Ku Klux Klan in Texas, was ordered 
by a court to cease harassing Vietnamese shrimp fishermen in Galveston. Five 
years later, he led racist skinheads in an Aryan Nations march in Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics were up in arms this week over the fact that Rogers, who has 
represented Republican-leaning portions of Kern, Inyo, San Bernardino and Los 
Angeles counties for 18 years as a legislator, would join Jubilee supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys are just hatemongers and it's an absolute disgrace for a 
California state senator to be speaking to such a group," said the Rev. Jerry 
Sloan of the Sacramento-based Project Tocsin, an organization that monitors the 
religious right. "The people with whom he is breaking bread may be Christian, 
but they are definitely also white supremacists," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers, however, says he is only interested in finding supporters to back his 
resolution underscoring the U.S. Constitution's 10th Amendment, which says the 
federal government cannot force unreasonable mandates on states. 
</P>
<P>
 The 66-year-old senator, who will be ousted by term limits in two years, also 
authored a resolution to reaffirm Californians' right to bear arms.

SAT TESTS SHOW GAINS MADE IN 1980S ERODING; EDUCATION: GIRLS DO SLIGHTLY BETTER 
IN MATH, BUT BOYS' VERBAL SCORES FALL. CALIFORNIA STUDENTS DECLINE IN BOTH 
AREAS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 American high school students continue to make plodding progress in math but 
are slipping back to historic lows in verbal skills, all but wiping out gains 
posted during the educational reform boom of the 1980s, the latest Scholastic 
Aptitude Test scores for graduating seniors show. 
</P>
<P>
 Tallies to be released today by the College Board for the nation and for 
California contain good and bad news for the high school Class of 1994: Girls 
are making gains but boys are slacking, particularly in verbal skills, and 
grade inflation remains unchecked. 
</P>
<P>
 In California -- where a greater proportion of high school students are poor, 
members of minority groups or speakers of English as their second language -- 
scores dropped 2 points in verbal skills. Math scores also dropped slightly, 
but the state still scores above the national average, a phenomenon one expert 
attributed to California's large Asian American student population. 
</P>
<P>
 There were grimmer results, however, for Los Angeles Unified School District 
seniors, whose average scores dropped 3 points in verbal skills and 8 points in 
math. Overall, the Los Angeles Unified scores remain well below the national 
average, although more seniors are taking the SAT. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1 million high school seniors nationwide -- a record 42% of the 
graduating class -- took the 2 1/2-hour test, an American rite of passage and 
an indicator of how students will fare in their freshman college year. SAT 
scores are often used as a benchmark for college admissions. 
</P>
<P>
 The SAT's verbal portion measures reading comprehension and vocabulary skills, 
while the math section tests knowledge of arithmatic, algebra and geometry. 
Both are graded on a scale of 200 to 800 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores in both categories slid during the 1970s and bottomed out with the 
Class of 1981, which earned a 424 in the verbal portion and 466 in math, for a 
total of 890. Those dismal marks, in part, prompted calls for more rigorous 
courses, basic skills testing and other classroom reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, math scores have risen steadily, and this year's graduating 
seniors scored 479 on the math portion, 1 point better than the Class of 1993. 
The reason: A strong showing by girls, whose math scores crept upward 3 points 
to 460, while the results for boys slid 1 point to 501. Statistics show girls 
were taking more pre-calculus, calculus and physics classes in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 In the verbal skills area of the SAT, the national average for girls went up a 
point, to 421 but boys more than wiped out that gain with a 3-point drop to 
425. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, officials of the College Board, the New York nonprofit 
organization that administers the test, suggested the backsliding may be the 
result of 10% fewer high school boys taking English grammar and composition 
courses. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the officials expressed cautious optimism that the 1994 results 
showed more of a "gradual turnaround in academic study" because a greater 
proportion of high school students are now taking the test -- a change that 
would depress all scores because a broader range of abilities is represented. 
</P>
<P>
 The report to be released today also found that grade inflation has not abated 
in high schools. This year 32% of graduating seniors reported an A average, up 
from 28% in 1987. Meanwhile, the average SAT scores were 6 to 15 points lower 
than six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, this year's graduating class dropped 2 points from last year in 
each skill scale. The 1994 verbal score is 413, 10 points below the national 
average, and on Wednesday Acting State Supt. of Public Instruction William D. 
Dawson issued a statement blaming economic and social factors for the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that compared to students nationwide, California students are poorer 
than average, more than twice as likely to have learned English as a second 
language and more than twice as likely to have parents who did not finish high 
school, and that they took fewer than half as many college-prep courses. But a 
higher percentage of California students took the SAT than took it nationally.

RWANDA REFUGEES ATTACK COUNTRYMEN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rwandan refugees attacked a group of their countrymen who were attempting to 
return home Wednesday, forcing the United Nations to halt the repatriation, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident came a day after five refugees were hacked to death for stealing 
in a refugee camp, said Ray Wilkinson, spokesman for the Office of the U.N. 
High Commissioner for Refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 About 250 Rwandans set out from the Goma-area refugee camps but never made it 
out of Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkinson said there was a report that five had been taken hostage, but 
officials later said it was unclear what happened to all the people because 
they scattered into banana groves. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the refugees were 25 game scouts and trackers for Rwanda's famed 
mountain gorilla reserve in the north and their extended families. They fled 
about a month ago to a mountaintop Zairian gorilla station near Rugari, a town 
about 27 miles north of the main refugee center of Goma.

ISRAEL, PLO AGREE TO MORE SELF-RULE; MIDEAST: NEGOTIATIONS YIELD EARLY TRANSFER 
OF SOME POWERS SEPT. 12. PALESTINIANS WILL SET UP TAX SYSTEM TO FUND PROGRAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Israel and the Palestine Liberation Organization initialed an agreement 
Wednesday on early transfer of civilian powers to Palestinians living in the 
Israeli-occupied West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 After a negotiating session that lasted into the night Tuesday, resumed 
Wednesday morning and finally ended at night, Israel said it would transfer 
authority on Sept. 12 to Palestinians for collecting taxes and for running 
health, welfare and tourism facilities throughout the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today is the real start for the implementation of the peace agreement on the 
West Bank," Palestinian negotiator Nabil Shaath told reporters in Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as negotiators there were still finishing their accord, the first 
transfer of a civilian portfolio in the West Bank to Palestinians was already 
under way. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli authorities formally turned over the Ramallah school district to 
Palestinians, in keeping with a separate agreement reached in Cairo last week, 
and promised that the rest of the West Bank education system will be turned 
over to Palestinians by Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a far-reaching, most important step," Israeli Foreign Minister Shimon 
Peres told Israel Radio about the education transfer. "I think we are acting 
wisely in not forcing our education on them, leaving them to educate in their 
own way." 
</P>
<P>
 The transfer of responsibility for civilian affairs is meant to give 
Palestinians in the West Bank -- who still live under Israeli military rule -- 
tangible evidence that Israel and the PLO are working toward an agreement to 
let Israel redeploy its troops out of Palestinian population centers and permit 
Palestinians to conduct local elections and run their daily lives. 
</P>
<P>
 But Israel's military administration of the territories will continue 
alongside the Palestinian bureaucracy for at least a year, Israeli officials 
said. The Israeli administration will not be dissolved until elections are held 
in the territories and Israel's troops are redeployed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will have to be cooperation," Shaath told reporters in Cairo. "We will 
need goodwill and a lot of cooperation; it will not work any other way." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat face 
rising opposition in their constituencies to the step-by-step disengagement 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 In Israel, members of Rabin's Cabinet and the main opposition party, Likud, 
have accused the PLO of failing to control Hamas, an Islamic extremist group, 
and of failing to keep its promise to cancel parts of the Palestine National 
Charter calling for Israel's destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Likud has called on Rabin to stop all negotiations with the Palestinians. 
Economics Minister Shimon Shetreet on Wednesday insisted that the early powers 
agreement will not take effect before the Cabinet votes on it; he said the 
Cabinet must be satisfied that the PLO is living up to its commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to critics, Rabin said Wednesday that he will bring the agreement 
to the Cabinet for a vote Sunday and expects to sign it, once ratified, in a 
ceremony with Arafat next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Palestinians, opposition to canceling the charter clauses offensive to 
Israel is so intense that officials admit privately they probably cannot get 
the two-thirds vote from the Palestine National Council to annul them. But 
Arafat wrote to Rabin a year ago promising the clauses would be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that Arafat has a problem here," a Rabin aide said. "But he made a 
commitment and he must keep that commitment." 
</P>
<P>
 The question of whether and when to convene a national council meeting in Gaza 
has become a lightning rod for Arafat critics, who fault the agreement he 
signed with Israel and his authoritarian style of governing in the territories. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Arafat was presented with a petition signed by a third of the 
national council, opposing any charter alteration. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting with members of the ruling Israeli Labor Party in Gaza on Wednesday, 
Arafat dismissed the petition. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with charges from Palestinians that he has merely relieved Israel of the 
burden of administering Gaza, where more than 800,000 Palestinians live, and 
with growing challenges to his leadership, Arafat was eager to show that Israel 
was willing to honor its commitment and extend self-rule to the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Israelis and Palestinians consider the West Bank a far more complex problem 
than the Gaza Strip, because there is so much more at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 For Rabin, there is the problem of how to ensure the security of tens of 
thousands of Jewish settlers whose communities are scattered across the West 
Bank. In Gaza, the handful of settlements are mostly concentrated in the north 
and are relatively easy for Israel's army to protect. 
</P>
<P>
 For Arafat, there is the problem of how to extend his authority to a far more 
sophisticated and wealthy population with much higher expectations than the 
Gazans. 
</P>
<P>
 There also is the unresolved problem of Jerusalem. Palestinians claim it as 
the capital of their future state; Israelis say its status as the undivided 
capital of Israel is non-negotiable. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerusalem's fate is to be decided in negotiations on the territories' final 
status, which will not begin for at least another two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks on transferring some civilian powers to the Palestinians got under way 
in Cairo on July 11 but were derailed several times by disputes over security 
in Gaza, release of Palestinian political prisoners and Israel's fear that the 
Palestinian Authority will be unable to fund civilian operations throughout the 
West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The toughest agreement for the sides to reach, Israelis and Palestinians say, 
was on taxation. Israel insisted that Palestinians must collect income tax to 
fund self-rule. But the Palestinians have no infrastructure to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Israel agreed to help the Palestinians set up an income tax 
system.

AMERICAN ALBUM: IT'S BIOLOGISTS VERSUS RHESUS IN THE KEYS; A LARGE COLONY OF 
MONKEYS RAISED FOR LAB RESEARCH HAVE TAXED THEIR ISLAND ENVIRONMENT. CRITICS 
SAY CONTROL EFFORTS ARE HALFHEARTED.

<P>
 Twenty years ago they were cast away on an uninhabited island and left to 
their own devices. Family groups formed, and under the hot subtropical sun a 
bustling society took shape. 
</P>
<P>
 And of course, they multiplied. From an original group of about 800 settlers, 
the population grew to more than 3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems arose even in paradise, however. Over the years hundreds of 
state-protected red mangroves have been killed by rambunctious residents who 
developed a taste for the leaves, and soil erosion has been pervasive. 
Environmentalists complain that the crystalline waters of the Florida Keys have 
been fouled by untreated fecal matter, and that some nesting birds may have 
been driven off. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was after some of the more adventuresome colonists began to roam off 
Key Lois and Raccoon Key and show up on neighboring islands that the loudest 
howls of protest were heard. Last year one of the marauding islanders was shot 
dead by federal agents, and just last week another was captured near Florida 4 
on Little Torch Key. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are totally out of place here," says wetlands biologist Curtis Kruer. 
</P>
<P>
 They are rhesus monkeys, free-ranging on two islands leased by a Boston-based 
subsidiary of Bausch & Lomb, for sale to medical laboratories. Each year 
Charles River Laboratories Inc. culls 400 to 500 monkeys from its colonies and 
ships them out to customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are a tremendous investment in that these animals are used for 
research," says Paul W. Schilling, director of primate breeding operations for 
Charles River. "They are virus-free animals, with no parasites. And although 
some have gotten off the islands, they would rather stay with the troop." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent agreements with the state, Charles River officials installed water 
treatment systems and agreed to re-foliate the islands. The monkey population 
has also been reduced to about 2,000, and within 14 years all the animals are 
to be off the islands entirely. Control of both islands would revert to Florida 
and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Raccoon Key, on the Gulf of Mexico side 
of U.S. 1, is within the boundaries of the Great White Heron National Wildlife 
Refuge. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kruer, who works as a bone-fishing guide and an environmental consultant, 
and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service biologist Jon Andrew are critical of that 
timetable and of Charles River's efforts to protect the islands. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are supposed to be fencing them in certain parts of the island, and they 
are not," says Andrew, who manages the 8,000-acre federal reserve of the 
endangered key deer on nearby Big Pine Key. "When you have that many monkeys 
out there, I am always going to be concerned about them getting away." 
</P>
<P>
 Those monkeys that have left their home islands and turned up in neighborhoods 
inhabited by people apparently swam or even walked through the shallow waters 
at low tides. A major storm, such as Hurricane Andrew in 1992, could scatter 
long-tailed primates all over the keys, Andrew says. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhesus monkeys, brownish natives of India, are widely used for medical and 
biological experimentation, and their tissue has long been popular in culturing 
the polio vaccine virus. Males can weigh up to 25 pounds, while the average 
female is about 12 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Schilling, a veterinarian, admits that the monkeys have caused some damage 
over the years, chiefly by killing hundreds of the tallest coastal mangroves in 
which the animals prefer to sit. But, he said, solar-powered electric fences 
have been installed to keep the animals away from replanted trees, and the 
islands' foliage is rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
 Kruer disputes that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charles River has not made a good faith effort to re-vegetate; they have 
planted a few seedlings," says Kruer, who failed in a courtroom effort to block 
the company's agreement with Florida. "Key Lois is eroding away. At extreme 
high tides, 99% of the island is under water. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charles River has gotten away with murder, and the state is remiss if not 
criminal in the way they have dealt with it. They have allowed state-protected 
trees to be used as food for a commercial monkey-breeding operation." 
</P>
<P>
 The company refuses to allow visitors to the islands. But Schilling defends 
the company's efforts to make reparations, and offers photographs that he says 
attest to the progress being made. And, he insists, native animals coexist well 
with the monkeys.

ZEDILLO AWAITS CONFIRMATION OF PRESIDENTIAL VICTORY IN MEXICO; ELECTION: WITH 
90% OF RETURNS COUNTED, OFFICIALS SAY IT IS 'STATISTICALLY CLEAR' THAT HE IS 
WINNER. PRD STILL REFUSES TO CONCEDE DEFEAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ernesto Zedillo, a once-shy shoeshine boy from Mexicali thrust onto center 
stage by an assassin's bullets in March, was all but declared this nation's 
next president Wednesday, extending 65 years of Institutional Revolutionary 
Party rule into the next century. 
</P>
<P>
 As the last of a record 35.4 million ballots were being counted from Sunday's 
election, described by many as a watershed of Mexican democracy, the 
quasi-independent Federal Electoral Institute began a marathon session 
Wednesday to confirm returns. The public process could take days to complete as 
opposition representatives and independent commissioners contest ballots from 
96,000 precincts nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 But election officials said it was statistically clear from the 90% of returns 
tabulated thus far in the presidential and legislative balloting that Zedillo 
had defeated his two leading challengers, winning just more than 50% of the 
vote. The PRI also appears to have won a large majority in both the 500-seat 
Chamber of Deputies and the 128-member Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday's elections, officials said, drew an unprecedented 77.5% of Mexico's 
45.7 million registered voters to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Diego Fernandez de Cevallos -- Zedillo's closest rival and a charismatic, 
conservative criminal lawyer -- did not concede defeat Wednesday; no loser in a 
Mexican presidential election has done so this century. Fernandez simply said 
he would await final word from electoral officials. 
</P>
<P>
 But, barring proof of massive fraud, most analysts expected his National 
Action Party representative appearing before the 10-member election commission 
to eventually approve the final results. They would give Fernandez 27% of the 
vote and the PAN a projected 28 Chamber seats and 24 Senate seats, based on 
Mexico's proportional representation system. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, in third place with 17% of the presidential vote, and his 
Democratic Revolutionary Party, will receive 13 seats in the Chamber and nine 
in the Senate, under the commission's preliminary results. PRD forces were less 
conciliatory than those of the PAN. 
</P>
<P>
 The PRD representative at the election commission angrily challenged the 
legitimacy of the entire electoral process dozens of times Wednesday. The party 
was expected to reject any confirmation of results, which then must also be 
approved by another election tribunal. 
</P>
<P>
 Formal declaration of Zedillo's status as president-elect can be made only by 
the next Chamber of Deputies, which convenes for its first session Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas, alleging massive fraud, is demanding an annulment of the elections 
and a new vote nationwide. He called on his supporters to flood Mexico City's 
historic main plaza Saturday to protest the elections. 
</P>
<P>
 That protest will provide another barometer of popular support for Cardenas' 
claim of fraud. But a similar Cardenas-led protest Tuesday drew just 20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the office of the special prosecutor for election fraud -- 
created in July as part of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's electoral 
reforms -- said it had received just 10 formal, documented complaints of 
abuses, adding that it is still accepting such claims. 
</P>
<P>
 There also was an attempt to sabotage the election at its very heart, Jose 
Carpizo MacGregor, the commission's chairman, disclosed Wednesday. Carpizo, who 
doubles as Mexico's appointed Interior Minister, said unknown forces 
unsuccessfully attempted to plant a computer virus in the election commission's 
central computers during the count. He said the incident is under 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican poll watchers and international visitors monitoring this nation's 
elections for the first time reported a range of ruling party abuses -- from 
intimidation and ballot-stuffing at the precinct level to the misuse of state 
resources nationwide for electioneering. 
</P>
<P>
 Most incidents, they said, occurred in remote, rural areas that delivered the 
late PRI vote surge that pushed Zedillo over the 50% mark. 
</P>
<P>
 But most monitors agreed that the illegalities and irregularities they 
witnessed appeared to have had no major impact on the presidential vote. 
</P>
<P>
 There was, however, continuing concern Wednesday about the possible 
disenfranchisement of an unknown number of Mexicans, who were directed to 
special polling places set up for voters to cast ballots while away from their 
home districts. Many reported that the polling places ran out of ballots before 
they could vote. 
</P>
<P>
 This also affected a large number of voters who had official credentials but 
whose names did not appear on a new, $730-million registration list. They also 
were sent to the special polling sites, where they too complained of 
insufficient ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 The election commission is investigating if the names were deliberately 
excised from the lists -- a process known here as "shaving" the vote -- or if 
the problem was unintentional. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides these problems, the independent poll watchers agreed that the ruling 
party also had built-in advantages in the elections. After six decades in 
power, the PRI has become inseparable from the institutions of government, a 
reality Zedillo has acknowledged and vowed to reform during his six-year term, 
which officially begins Dec. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 With a higher margin of victory than initial returns had indicated, it was 
unclear whether Zedillo's new administration would adhere to his pledges of 
fundamental party reform. The promises were a key factor for many voters who 
selected the PRI, according to opinion polls and exit interviews before and 
during the elections. 
</P>
<P>
 For Fernandez, the need for just such change led to his bottom-line assessment 
of Mexico's new, improved electoral process. "I cannot bless it," he said, "nor 
can I damn it." 
</P>
<P>
 In a wide-ranging session with reporters, Fernandez outlined specific reforms 
Zedillo must put in place if he is to convince Mexicans that Sunday's elections 
were the dawn of a new age of Mexican democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez spoke of still-feared "mafias" within the government that "pretend 
at total change, but a change that will leave everything the same." He 
condemned the PRI abuse of power in the elections, echoing the observation of 
many of the foreign visitors that the party blatantly threatened to withhold 
government subsidies to poor farmers, effectively buying millions of votes in 
the rural areas. 
</P>
<P>
 He cast himself in a new role as a catalyst for change, saying, "No one can 
imagine another six years with more of the same." He said he would not retire 
from politics but would work urgently to dismantle what he said was the 
undemocratic PRI machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez also criticized his fellow opposition rival for having "shored up 
the official system." 
</P>
<P>
 "Paradoxically, for all that he has highlighted against the system, Cardenas 
has justified many a vote in favor of the government candidate," Fernandez 
said. "His belligerent attitude and his intolerance have encouraged a 
fainthearted vote for the government's candidate." 
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas offered no response Wednesday, indicating that he was saving his 
comments for the weekend rally. 
</P>
<P>
 But other independent observers saw great import in Sunday's vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergio Aguayo -- the respected chairman of an umbrella pro-democracy group 
formed to monitor and assess the elections -- said the balloting was a landmark 
event in Mexican history, if only because it showed the immediate need for 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the perspective of a nonpartisan citizen, the presidential elections 
give many reasons to celebrate, lament and reflect," he said in a report that 
included his Civic Alliance's findings of widespread irregularities in the 
polls. 
</P>
<P>
 He recalled all the turbulence that had occurred in this election year, 
including: an armed peasant uprising in the southern state of Chiapas; the 
assassination of Luis Donaldo Colosio, the PRI's original presidential 
candidate; economic uncertainty, and a bitter election battle. Aguayo echoed 
the view of many voters in concluding that "1994 has been one of the most 
turbulent and unstable years in our history." 
</P>
<P>
 Such events might explain why voters had shown a conservative streak, 
bolstering Zedillo's apparent victory after a campaign in which he cast himself 
as the only safe change and the only choice for stability and peace.

BOSNIAN TROOPS ACCUSED OF RAPING, KILLING CIVILIANS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Muslim-led Bosnian government troops raped and killed civilians and looted and 
burned houses when they captured the rebel Muslim enclave of Bihac in 
northwestern Bosnia, refugee survivors alleged Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A Polish U.N. officer confirmed that he saw troops of the Bosnian army's Fifth 
Corps fire at a group of refugees who escaped from the rebel stronghold of 
Velika Kladusa over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot say anyone got killed in the shooting, but there were at least 20 
wounded, all with leg injuries," said Lt. Col. Wojciech Akasamit. Some of those 
hit were wearing uniforms but none was armed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Refugees packing makeshift camps where food and water are scarce blamed the 
behavior of government troops for their refusal to return home despite the 
urging of U.N. aid officials and the Croatian and Bosnian governments. 
</P>
<P>
 But accusations that the United Nations had covered up atrocities were denied 
by a U.N. spokesman in Zagreb. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is certainly no cover-up on the part of the U.N.," said the official, 
who declined to be named. "We are very concerned about any human rights abuses. 
We heard allegations of abuses, but none of the reports were confirmed." 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 30,000 refugees from Bihac are stranded in camps in the self-declared 
Republic of Serbian Krajina, and at the Turanj checkpoint in the U.N.-patrolled 
buffer zone between Croatia and the republic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our truth cannot get through to the world," said Fatima Stulanovic, 53, from 
Velika Kladusa. 
</P>
<P>
 Some refugees said that Sunday morning, when the exodus began, the Fifth Corps 
cut off the main road south of Velika Kladusa and shot and killed several 
civilians in the panic that followed. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the Bosnian and Croatian governments, together with the United Nations, 
have urged the refugees to return home, assuring them that they will face no 
reprisals.

CHINA, REELING FROM TYPHOON, ACTS TO STABILIZE FOOD PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The killer typhoon that hit southern China this week is the latest in a summer 
of disasters causing huge losses for the country's industries and agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 In a new sign of impending problems, the government Wednesday issued an 
"urgent notice" calling for measures to stabilize prices of vegetables, pork 
and other foods. 
</P>
<P>
 The prices of these items have been going up too fast this summer in the 
cities, the Ministry of Internal Trade said in its circular to officials 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 It suggested ways to curb price increases in state-owned stores and called for 
a crackdown on hoarding food. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the toll of dead rose to at least 710 from Typhoon Fred, which hit 
coastal Zhejiang province on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Washington, environmentalist Lester R. Brown warned that China's impressive 
economic growth, spurring a demand for more food imports, could trigger a 
long-feared global food crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Current concern about hunger centers on Africa. But Brown, who heads the 
independent Worldwatch Institute, said, "It will not be in the devastation of 
poverty-stricken Somalia or Haiti, but in the booming economy of China that we 
will see the inevitable collision" of supply and demand. 
</P>
<P>
 The world simply may not be able to produce enough food to meet the shortfall 
looming for China, Brown wrote in the September-October issue of World Watch, 
the magazine of the Washington-based think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 "When China turns to world markets on an ongoing basis, its food scarcity will 
become the world's scarcity," he said.

22 POUNDS OF URANIUM RECOVERED BY RUSSIANS; REGULATION: MATERIAL STOLEN FROM A 
CLOSED NUCLEAR CENTER IS REPORTEDLY NOT WEAPONS-GRADE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAREY GOLDBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Russian security officials, adding weight to promises that they would work 
harder to stop nuclear smuggling, announced Wednesday that they recovered more 
than 22 pounds of uranium stolen from a closed nuclear center. 
</P>
<P>
 The uranium-238 is not weapons-grade and Atomic Energy Ministry spokesman 
Georgy Kaurov said the material is so harmless it could best be used as a 
weight for a fishing lure or "to make presses for buckets of sauerkraut." 
</P>
<P>
 But in the wake of German accusations that plutonium recently seized in the 
Munich airport originated in Russia, the uranium case served as concrete 
reassurance that Moscow would try harder to keep its nuclear stocks under 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 The origin of the Munich plutonium has not definitely been established, but 
German suspicions that it came from Russia -- it arrived on a Lufthansa flight 
from Moscow -- were so strong that Chancellor Helmut Kohl dispatched his 
intelligence coordinator for three days of talks with Russian security chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 The meetings yielded joint resolutions Monday to fight the nuclear black 
market harder and with more coordination but no definitive word on where the 
plutonium came from. 
</P>
<P>
 Western governments harbor intense fears that the general disarray and 
corruption in the former Soviet Union will lead to a swelling supply of 
black-market nuclear materials that could ultimately be used by terrorists or a 
hostile dictatorship to hold the world hostage. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear whether there is a market for purloined uranium and plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
 But the latest Russian theft, solved by police in the closed nuclear city 
called Arzamas-16, demonstrated that the supply of the radioactive materials, 
or at least the will to provide them, is abundant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think these fools who stole the uranium in Arzamas-16 simply fell for the 
turmoil in the press," Kaurov said. "They thought they could sell it for 
millions of dollars and make a fortune out of it. They didn't know what they 
were doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite some Western aid, the nuclear industry in Russia remains a hungry one. 
At the Kurchatov Institute, one of Russia's premier nuclear centers, scientists 
earn a mere $100 a month and atomic power plant workers have repeatedly 
threatened to strike because their salaries were delayed for months. Police 
have noted a tendency by workers to steal almost anything radioactive in the 
belief that it will find a buyer on the black market. 
</P>
<P>
 The kind of press encouragement Kaurov referred to can be found in newspapers 
like the daily Vechernaya Moskva, which told readers a rise in nuclear thefts 
was inevitable in coming months because Russia's economy is so bad and the 
materials are so valuable. 
</P>
<P>
 It quoted Sergei Novikov, one of the top officials in Russia's nuclear 
inspection agency, who told Radio Liberty that, at a factory near the Estonian 
border, at least 22 nuclear fuel units had been stolen in the course of a year 
and sold to Estonian factories. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you want, when you can get such materials in Russia for a bottle (of 
vodka) and sell them in Estonia for a few thousand dollars?" he reportedly 
asked. 
</P>
<P>
 The uranium-238 stolen in Arzamas-16 was found Sunday, the Federal 
Counterintelligence Service reported Wednesday. It said the uranium was good 
only for industrial use, not for bomb-building, and would normally cost about 
$50 a pound if bought officially. 
</P>
<P>
 The uranium had been reported missing earlier in Arzamas-16 -- a high-security 
center of nuclear science, much like Los Alamos in New Mexico -- and police 
arrested two unemployed men on suspicion of stealing the material. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, on Wednesday, Pakistan sought to defuse its latest nuclear 
controversy, caused by a former Pakistani prime minister who claimed his 
country possesses the atomic bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 Nawaz Sharif, the former prime minister who now heads the main opposition 
party, said Tuesday in a speech at Neela Butt, part of the disputed Kashmir 
territory controlled by Pakistan, that "I confirm that Pakistan possesses the 
atomic bomb." He insisted that Pakistan did not have the bomb when he served as 
its leader. 
</P>
<P>
 But Foreign Minister Sardar Assef Ahmed Ali on Wednesday repeated Pakistan's 
longstanding position that it has the components and the know-how to make 
atomic bombs but has not done so. "I want to say categorically that Pakistan 
does not have nuclear weapons and does not intend to make nuclear weapons," Ali 
said in an interview on state television.

SAUDI DIPLOMAT GETS POLITICAL ASYLUM IN U.S. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Saudi diplomat who defected to the United States, claiming that his 
government tried secretly to get nuclear arms, has been granted U.S. political 
asylum, his lawyers said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mohammed Khilewi, formerly a senior diplomat at the Saudi mission to the 
United Nations, was granted asylum by the U.S. Immigration and Naturalization 
Service, according to a statement released by his attorneys, Leon and Michael 
Wildes of New York. 
</P>
<P>
 INS officials would not confirm or deny this, saying that the granting of 
asylum is a private matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Khilewi has been quoted as saying that in 1989 efforts were made to buy 
nuclear research reactors from China and from Marine Services Ltd. in 
Alexandria, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department said earlier this month that it had no evidence to 
support Khilewi's allegations.

AT UNIVERSITY HIGH, A CULTURE OF ACHIEVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 University High is accustomed to being at the top of academic accolade lists, 
but the latest round of Scholastic Aptitude Test results being released today 
by the College Board show a stunning new level of success. 
</P>
<P>
 With 80% of the Class of 1994 having taken the college admissions exams -- 
nearly double the participation rate in California and the nation -- University 
High posted its best-ever score, an average of 1,109 out of a possible 1,600. 
</P>
<P>
 That's more than 200 points above state and national averages. The sky-high 
average represents a 19-point leap from last year's already superb score, and 
is 131 points higher than the school's average SAT score a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 No other school in Orange County posted scores within 40 points of 
University's math average, 607, or within 30 points of its verbal average, 502. 
</P>
<P>
 "Achievement is in at University High School. That's a strong part of the 
culture," said Leah Laule, a district administrator in Irvine who left 
University High last spring after five years as principal and five as assistant 
principal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whereas there may be some other things at other schools that drive the 
culture, achievement at Uni drives a lot of students." 
</P>
<P>
 With about 1,900 students, "Uni" -- as the school is known -- routinely sends 
95% of its graduates directly to college. About two-thirds of those go to 
four-year schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Known statewide for its rigorous curriculum, competitive classroom culture, 
outstanding teachers and strong parental support, University's reputation has 
helped attract students who are serious about learning, administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
 The student body is 54% white, 37% Asian, 4.5% Latino and 3% black and is 
drawn largely from the neighborhood around UC Irvine. But through Irvine 
Unified's open enrollment program, students from throughout the district, 
including those living at the El Toro and Tustin marine bases, also attend. 
</P>
<P>
 While many schools and districts see scores slip when more students take the 
SATs, University High's participation and achievement have risen together. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Unified Superintendent David Brown said Wednesday that the school 
offers no specific SAT training, though many students take private preparation 
courses. Both said they believed challenging classroom work readied 
University's students for the test. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the school are dozens of outstanding individuals: 49 students scored 
between 750 and 800 (the highest score possible) on the math portion, and five 
earned similar high scores on verbal exam. Another 166 scored above 600 on the 
math test, while 99 more students posted scores higher than 600 on the verbal 
segment. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more kids that are really high, high, high achievers at Uni than 
there may be at the other schools," Laule admitted. "When you have good 
material to work with, it's not quite as difficult to support kids in their 
learning."

CASTRO BLASTS U.S. POLICY, CALLS BASE A 'CONCENTRATION CAMP' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a speech here late Wednesday night, Fidel Castro blasted the U.S. decision 
to intern refugees at the Guantanamo Bay naval base, and said the U.S. trade 
embargo was the root of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must discuss this affair seriously.To go to the bottom of the problem 
means putting an end to the blockade," a translator quoted Castro as saying on 
CNN, which broadcast the speech live. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro said Washington was "creating a concentration camp at Guantanamo Bay." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Fernando Remirez de Estenoz Barciela, Cuba's ambassador to the 
United Nations, said the policy was devised to pressure Cubans to overthrow 
Castro and warned that the policy would lead to disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. has devised a whole policy . . . to try to choke our country to 
hunger and allow an internal subversion that would lead to a blood bath, and 
then how many millions of illegal immigrants will come?" Remirez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The moves announced by President Clinton Saturday included stopping cash 
remittances from relatives in the United States to Cuba, cutting back on 
charter flights between Havana and Miami and increasing radio broadcasts to 
Cuba from the United States.

FOR SOME CUBANS, RAFTS TURN INTO DEATHTRAPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH SHOGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Havana man and his brother had been drifting on a raft in the Florida 
Straits for nine days under the scorching sun. They were dehydrated, suffering 
from exposure, delirious. 
</P>
<P>
 As two other refugees watched in horror from a nearby vessel crafted of 
Styrofoam, the man announced to his brother: "I've got to go now. Mom is making 
breakfast." With that, he stepped off the raft and disappeared into the rolling 
sea. 
</P>
<P>
 The brother, weak and left "without will" from dehydration and hunger, made no 
attempt to save him, according to Orlando Abelindo, 44, who said he witnessed 
the tragic scene from the Styrofoam raft. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long after the man, believed to be in his early 30s, stepped off the raft 
to his death, Abelindo said he saw a severed leg float past his own craft. 
</P>
<P>
 Although thousands of people who fled Cuba in jerry-built rafts during the 
last 10 days have been rescued by the U.S. Coast Guard, passing cruise ships 
and cargo boats, an unknown number of others have died -- some from exposure or 
dehydration, others because their unseaworthy rafts sank and still others 
because they suffered from the kind of hallucination that afflicted the man who 
went to his death as his brother and Abelindo watched. Thinking they saw land 
just ahead, they have jumped into the high seas, where they drowned or were 
attacked by sharks. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're floating in the sea, it is such a vast area that it's like being 
in the desert. You start to hallucinate. You think you see horses or you think 
you see land," said Abelindo, who recalled that at one point, he also imagined 
seeing land after floating for nine hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Coast Guard officials said they believe that most rafters who reach 
international waters 12 miles from Cuba are rescued. In the last few days, only 
a few people have been found dead on rafts, said Lt. Cmdr. Jim Howe, a Coast 
Guard spokesman in Key West, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we just don't know how many people leave Cuba and don't make it outside 
Cuban waters where the Coast Guard is not able to patrol," Howe said. 
</P>
<P>
 While many rafters are able to reach the 12-mile mark in a day or less by 
rowing or using sail or motor power, others can languish in the zone just off 
Cuban shores for days, stalled by the whims of tides, winds and currents. 
</P>
<P>
 Howe recalled rescuing nine people last summer aboard two rafts that were 
drifting at the 12 1/2-mile mark. The refugees had already been at sea for five 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Private pilots who fly above the Straits have reported seeing dozens of empty 
boats, signifying to them that the passengers had died. Generally, the Coast 
Guard sinks rafts after rescuing the refugees, although Howe said the high 
number of rescues in recent days has made that task impossible in some cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Rosendahl, dean of the University of Miami's Rosenstiel School of Marine 
and Atmospheric Science, said the current in the Florida Straits is so powerful 
and the job of detecting the small rafts in the vast 90-mile stretch of choppy 
sea so difficult that the Coast Guard cannot possibly intercept all of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly some slip through," Rosendahl said. "We have no idea what those 
numbers are. Nobody does." 
</P>
<P>
 The missing variable, he said, is that no one knows how many people are 
attempting the journey. 
</P>
<P>
 That so many would set out on crudely made vessels to travel the 90 miles to 
the United States is stunning to those who best understand the rigors of such a 
journey. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any of us scientists would contemplate that voyage in the kind 
of craft we have seen on television -- no matter how bad it is in Cuba," 
Rosendahl said. 
</P>
<P>
 A wall in the Transit Center for Cuban Refugees, a way station on Stock Island 
near Key West, speaks powerfully about the risks the voyagers face. It is 
covered with hundreds of slips of paper bearing the names of Cubans who set out 
for the United States during the last two years but never reached their 
destination.

FLOOD FILLS GEORGIA CITY WITH DISCONTENT; DISASTER: MANY BLACK RESIDENTS OF

 South-central Albany is a ghost town. Who knows where the people have gone, 
but their houses sit abandoned. For mile after desolate mile, the homes squat 
beneath a merciless sun, front doors gaping. Some have tumbled down, 
half-swallowed by gigantic sinkholes. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven weeks after floods ravaged southwest Georgia and parts of Alabama and 
Florida, the herculean task of rebuilding in this, the hardest hit section of 
the hardest hit town, has hardly begun. 
</P>
<P>
 But as other communities along the Flint, Ocmulgee and Chattahoochee rivers 
pull together in the wake of what is being called Georgia's worst natural 
disaster, in Albany the legacy of racial separation and distrust has further 
torn people apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the black community allege that city and county officials deliberately 
diverted floodwater to their neighborhoods in order to save northern areas 
where affluent white people live. Local officials strongly deny this. But in an 
African American community molded by a history of powerlessness and perceived 
neglect, the rumors spread with the relentlessness of the floodwater. 
</P>
<P>
 "Immediately after the flood that's all people were talking about as they 
stood in lines," said Mary Young-Cummings, a lawyer and former state legislator 
who lost her home in the flood. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we want to know is, was the water manipulated in such a way that the 
more affluent neighborhoods were spared devastation to the detriment of the 
black community?" she said. "They got flooding, but we got devastated. And we 
got miles and miles and miles of devastation." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Justice Department has launched an investigation of the way the flood 
was handled at the request of the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who has visited Albany 
twice to hear citizen concerns. Last weekend, during his most recent visit, 
state and local police provided unusually heavy protection because of high 
racial tension and alleged death threats. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, more than 5,000 families in the county were displaced by the flood, 
say officials, who predict the damage in the county will surpass $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
 A Georgia State University economist estimated last week that the flood would 
have a $1-billion impact in the state overall, including $500 million in damage 
to uninsured property and $200 million in agricultural losses. Throughout the 
region, a number of small towns that already were struggling to survive were 
nearly wiped off the map. In Montezuma, for example, virtually the entire 
downtown area -- 68 businesses -- was under 10 feet of water at one point. Town 
officials there optimistically predict all but one or two businesses will 
reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 But in Albany, a city of 80,000 people, the devastation in the south-central 
section is so widespread that Young-Cummings says she fears that many residents 
will not resettle there. That could lead to a weakening of black voting 
strength in a city where blacks make up a majority of the population (57% 
officially) but have only this year won a majority of the seats on the city 
commission. 
</P>
<P>
 While white areas of Albany also received heavy flood damage, Mayor Paul 
Keenan acknowledges that the lower-lying African American section of town 
received the greater residential damage. He insisted, though, that this was the 
result of geography and nature. "There was no manipulation of water," he said. 
"You don't manipulate that kind of flood." 
</P>
<P>
 He cites a state report issued last week that showed that dams on Lake Chehaw 
and Lake Blackshear were too small to control all the water that was dumped on 
the area last month by Tropical Storm Alberto. 
</P>
<P>
 But many south side residents aren't satisfied. Young-Cummings charged that 
the report merely "rubber-stamped" conclusions that already had been reached by 
local officials, alleging that the first draft of the study was reviewed by the 
officials and by executives of the power companies that own the dams. 
</P>
<P>
 South side residents are particularly suspicious because their area was 
flooded on a sunshiny day, they say, two days before the Flint River actually 
overflowed its banks. The water burst with explosive force from underground, 
through storm drains and the sewer system. Residents talk of seeing manhole 
covers lifted 15 feet in the air by the force of the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no time for me to get anything out of my house," said Myra Hosely, 
who has been living with relatives since her home was flooded and all of her 
possessions destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say water rose from the storm drains because the waste-water system 
was overwhelmed by all the water. "The flood was not controlled, and no one was 
capable of controlling the flood," said the report released last week. "The 
operation of the dams was completely proper, logical and responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials acknowledge that water was pumped out of north Albany after that 
area flooded, but they say the water was pumped to a drainage basin west of the 
city and away from the flooded area. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, I think the people of Albany have been provided with 
factual information about the causes of the flood and the procedures that were 
followed," said Keenan, adding that officials "did all they could to protect 
lives and property of all the parts of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 At a hearing Jackson and Young-Cummings held Saturday to hear citizen 
concerns, some residents complained that they thought the city was more 
concerned with protecting downtown buildings, such as the civic center, than 
with helping residents or trying to save the predominantly black Albany State 
College, which suffered massive flood damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Other African Americans say they were treated poorly at assistance centers and 
by federal rescue personnel while whites were given preferential treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson led a march through the devastated area and laid a wreath at the 
city-owned cemetery where 400 caskets were forced out of the ground by angry 
waters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got enough sense to know a flood is an act of God," Jackson said, 
responding to criticisms directed at him by local officials. But he added: "The 
water flow is an act of man. So fairness is a legitimate concern." He stressed, 
though, that he wasn't making allegations -- merely asking questions on behalf 
of residents who felt they were being neglected.

WASHINGTON HEALTH DEBATE IS A REPLAY FOR CALIFORNIANS; REFORM: THE STATE TOOK A 
NEARLY IDENTICAL JOURNEY, FROM UNIVERSAL COVERAGE TO PRAGMATIC COMPROMISE. THE 
VOLUNTARY MEASURES FEATURE KEY CLINTON GOALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the health care debate raging in Washington sounds eerily familiar to 
Californians, there's good reason: Two years ago, the state went through a 
nearly identical process. 
</P>
<P>
 It began with sweeping plans to achieve universal coverage financed by 
employers, but eventually settled for a less ambitious package of insurance 
industry reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 The lessons learned by the state could offer a blueprint for national 
reformers, even as President Clinton and Congress abandon their hopes for major 
reform legislation this year that focuses on universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 California's laws provide some of the most cherished goals sought by the 
President: Insurance companies cannot refuse to sell insurance to small firms 
or cancel coverage because of the health status of a company's workers. An 
insured worker with health problems is not required to go through a waiting 
period to obtain full coverage after changing jobs. And there are strict price 
limits -- no matter how sick the work force is, a company cannot be forced to 
pay more than 20% above the standard rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after the changes, 5 million Californians still have no health insurance. 
Nonetheless, the state's legislation, a compromise brokered between a 
Democratic Legislature and Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, is widely perceived as 
a major, pragmatic step on the road to health reform. 
</P>
<P>
 It has made insurance available at reasonable rates for the small-business 
community and its workers who once were at the mercy of an insurance industry 
that could arbitrarily refuse to provide coverage, could cancel policies, or 
raise premiums without any restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 The law created the Health Insurance Plan of California, a voluntary alliance 
-- unlike the huge mandatory alliance proposed by Clinton -- that enables 
employers to offer their workers a choice among 22 different health plans. 
Armed with negotiating powers, it won a 6% reduction in insurance premiums last 
month. Although the HIPC is small, covering 58,000 workers and dependents from 
3,400 employers, its existence provides a competitive spur to private insurers 
throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "There really are striking parallels to what is now happening in Washington," 
said Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los Angeles), a key author of the reform 
measure. "We went through a major effort to get a universal coverage system for 
California," he recalled. But the efforts for an employer mandate ran into the 
unyielding opposition of the business community and then-Gov. George 
Deukmejian. 
</P>
<P>
 When Wilson became governor in 1991, he gave his backing to the idea of 
insurance reform, but made it clear he shared Deukmejian's aversion to making 
coverage compulsory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed to do the best we could," said Margolin, summing up lengthy and 
complex negotiations among legislators, insurance industry representatives and 
members of the business community. When the governor said at a crucial point in 
1992 that he would sign a reform bill, "that gave us tremendous momentum," 
Margolin said. The reform bill was passed on the last day of the 1992 
legislative session and took effect on July 1, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill provided a new competitive market for small firms, those with fewer 
than 50 workers seeking coverage: 
</P>
<P>
 * Insurers had to make all products available to all customers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Insurers had to publish their rates, and could classify customers only by 
their age and the region of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rate differentials were limited. An insurer would have to publish its 
standard rate for a group. It could give no more than a 20% discount for a firm 
with the healthiest workers, and charge no more than 20% above the standard 
rate for a company with the sickest work force. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurance market now is more competitive. In fact, the average charges for 
many customers are lower now than in 1991, according to Mark Weinberg, 
executive vice president of Blue Cross of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the new laws, "small employers have much better access today, and 
fairly reasonable pricing," said Terry Hartshorn, chief executive officer of 
UniHealth America, which operates two major health maintenance organizations, 
along with 10 hospitals and four physicians groups. 
</P>
<P>
 PacificCare, a big UniHealth HMO, with 900,000 members, recently decided to 
make itself available to customers of the state purchasing alliance, the HIPC. 
"We were skeptical at first, but decided to join because of its success," 
Hartshorn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Margolin is hopeful that future legislatures will make the insurance reforms 
-- which apply to companies with three to 50 workers -- available for the 
self-employed, for companies with just two people, and for individuals working 
at firms without insurance coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 California's insurance reform was a good first step on a much longer road to 
reform, experts agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took away a lot of fears business people had that health insurance 
wouldn't be there," said Alan Katz, principal owner of Centerstone, an 
insurance and benefits firm in Woodland Hills. "But it is not a solution to the 
overall problem that there are a lot of uninsured people in California and 
medical costs are spiraling out of control." 
</P>
<P>
 The vast majority of the uninsured are full-time, low-wage workers at medium 
and small firms. "Many small businesses cannot afford to provide health 
insurance and stay in business," said Allan Zaremberg, senior vice president 
for legislative affairs at the California Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 The dilemma, for California and the nation, is finding a way to cover these 
uninsured workers. But the stalemate in Washington indicates that will be a 
battle for another day. 
</P>
<P>
 In the short run, according to Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), insurance 
reform is a top priority for members of Congress striving to do something this 
year. She said Wednesday she favors "taking that first step."

CHAVIS AGREES TO DISCUSSIONS WITH NAACP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only days after the NAACP fired Benjamin F. Chavis Jr. as executive director 
and minutes after a judge refused to reinstate him, Chavis and organization 
leaders agreed Wednesday to discuss an amicable settlement of their bitter 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Herbert Dixon declined Chavis' request Wednesday for a 
temporary restraining order, saying he could no more order the NAACP to take 
Chavis back than he could force Chavis to continue to work against his wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The judge's ruling stands for itself," said the NAACP's interim 
administrator, Earl T. Shinhoster. "The past is prologue. We're moving 
forward." 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis said that he hoped to avoid a full-blown court fight with the NAACP, 
but that "we'll be back here, ready to go" if the settlement offers don't 
satisfy him. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis sued the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People on 
Monday, arguing that the group's board of directors failed to follow its own 
procedures when it fired him Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The firing terminated a three-year employment contract that gave Chavis a 
$200,000 annual salary plus a housing allowance, a pension of up to $75,000 a 
year, medical and health insurance and $1 million in life insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavis said the firing besmirched his reputation and left him unemployed when 
his wife, Martha, is pregnant with twins. NAACP general counsel Dennis Hayes 
said Wednesday that Chavis' health benefits had not been terminated, nor had 
his paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
 In firing Chavis, board members cited his failure to disclose that he used 
NAACP money to settle a $332,400 sex discrimination claim by former employee 
Mary E. Stansel. 
</P>
<P>
 According to an affidavit by board Vice President Larry Carter, other aspects 
of Chavis' leadership were also a factor in his firing, including the group's 
nearly $3-million budget deficit.

WILLIAM BENNETT SAYS HE WON'T RUN FOR PRESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 William J. Bennett, a former education secretary and drug policy director and 
the author of the best-seller "The Book of Virtues," said Wednesday that he 
would not seek the 1996 Republican presidential nomination. 
</P>
<P>
 After the success of his book, morality tales he compiled to counter what he 
contends is a decline of values in America, Bennett had been courted by 
religious conservatives and others to enter what is likely to be a crowded GOP 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of that interest, he had promised to spend the summer reconsidering 
earlier statements that he would not run. Bennett talked during the past 
several weeks with party strategists searching for a way to run an 
unconventional campaign. He has made no secret of his distaste for the heavy 
travel and fund raising required of presidential candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a statement he said he had concluded "now is not the right time for me 
to seek the presidency." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett said he planned to be an active force in this year's congressional 
elections and the 1996 national campaign.

O.C. LEADERS HOPEFUL AFTER RAMS TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The proposal presented to the Los Angeles Rams on Wednesday by a committee 
that is trying to keep the team in Orange County drew a cautiously hopeful 
reaction from city, business and civic leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Daly said the plan could be a "major step forward" if the Rams show 
interest in it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a sound package, and it can be the basis for a new partnership 
between the Rams and the Orange County community," Daly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Save the Rams task force, made up of dozens of local business 
people and elected officials, are hoping to entice the Rams to stay in Orange 
County with a proposal to refurbish Anaheim Stadium. The group has also 
proposed to build a new training facility and corporate headquarters for the 
team in Orange. In addition, the proposal includes purchase of a minority 
interest in the team, which would provide the Rams with a $50-million infusion 
of cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly said the Save the Rams plan is realistic from the city's standpoint, 
although "most of the pieces of the package are conceptual and there are still 
a lot of details to work out." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Irv Pickler said he is supportive of the proposal as long as the 
city does not have to bear the brunt of it financially. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city of Anaheim does not have any money," Pickler said. "But as long as I 
can see a funding source, I have no problem with what's been proposed. I think 
it's an impressive offer and something any good team would and should look at." 
</P>
<P>
 But Pickler said he is still doubtful that the NFL franchise will stay in 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just have a feeling that it's not going to happen, although I hope that it 
does," he said. "If we can get some reaction from the Rams, everyone will jump 
with joy." 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Chamber of Commerce officials said they were impressed with the 
package but pessimistic that it will entice the team to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're realistic," said interim executive director Jay Walton. "I wouldn't bet 
the farm, but we are hopeful that this will succeed." 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Disney Co. officials said the proposal is a solid one and should make the 
team stop and take notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "How can they not at least pay attention now?" said Ron Dominguez, executive 
vice president of Walt Disney attractions. "I think the deal presented gives 
the Rams a lot to consider. It shows that there is a lot of belief in them in 
the community. They should have a sense that they are welcome here and that 
this community wants them here." 
</P>
<P>
 Rams Booster Club President Frank Bryant, a member of the Save the Rams 
committee, said the proposal is filled with "excellent ideas." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping it will cause (the team) to stop and reconsider and maybe start 
negotiating," Bryant said. "If they do that, then we have accomplished a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Most leaders praised the efforts of the Save the Rams committee, which they 
said completed its work in a remarkably short period. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the group did a phenomenal job," Pickler said. "They have tried 
everything. If this doesn't do it, my hat is still off to them. They have been 
dedicated and sincere and pulled out all the stops to get the team to say yes."

MCNALL SAYS HOCKEY REALITY MUCH MORE THAN AN ILLUSION; KINGS: DESPITE CHARGES, 
NEW OWNERS STANDING BEHIND EMBATTLED PRESIDENT, WHO CONTINUES TO REPRESENT 
TEAM. "YOU WISH YOU HADN'T DONE CERTAIN THINGS," HE SAYS.

<P>
 His reputation sullied by accusations of bank fraud and other misdeeds, Bruce 
McNall vowed Wednesday "to make restitution," as well as to continue his 
commitment to hockey as president of the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 He received a strong endorsement from new team co-owner Joseph Cohen, who 
said: "We want to make it clear to everyone that not only has Bruce McNall been 
a very, very important figure to the Kings and to this game, but that he still 
is." 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported on Wednesday that McNall has agreed with federal 
prosecutors to plead guilty to four criminal counts -- one of bank fraud, two 
of mail fraud and one of conspiracy -- and most likely enter that plea no 
earlier than mid-September. McNall and his attorney, Tom Pollack, would not 
confirm the report on Wednesday. But in an interview, they said McNall's legal 
troubles had not affected his working relationship with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 For the time being, McNall made it clear that he had not abandoned the Kings, 
nor they him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm OK, you know me," McNall said. "I don't know what will happen, but 
there's nothing to do but take things as they come. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel bad about all the things I've done in the past. Maybe it's the 
historian in me that feels, you know, you can't change what's already been. You 
wish you hadn't done certain things. I know that I need to make restitution 
from a greed standpoint and from the city's standpoint, and I will. That's all 
I can do. Whatever my personal future is, it is." 
</P>
<P>
 McNall, Cohen and Pollack spoke by telephone from New York, where the Kings' 
executives attended a conference of the NHL board of governors. Although McNall 
resigned as chairman of the board once the investigation into his financial 
dealings became public, he continues to represent the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether NHL officials had asked him to resign his remaining posts, 
McNall said: "If at any point in time I felt that it was in hockey's best 
interests, I'm sure that I would. But there's been absolutely no request." 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen interjected a strong vote of support. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Anaheim and San Jose and Miami franchises are realities. The sold-out 
houses game after game in Los Angeles are realities. These are all testaments 
to Bruce McNall's doing," said Cohen, who along with Jeffrey Sudikoff purchased 
72% of McNall's interest in the Kings three months ago. "Bruce has done wonders 
for hockey and has helped a lot of people in the process." 
</P>
<P>
 Pollack added: "Just because Bruce has some bank-loan problems, (it) shouldn't 
diminish everything he has done with the Kings. They're separate things." 
</P>
<P>
 Both men were responding to recent critical assessments of McNall's past 
involvement with the Kings and to supposition that the club and the league 
might be better off disassociating themselves from him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both Tom and Joe are probably more upset about this than I am," McNall said. 
"But it's true that it does hurt to hear yourself referred to as being in 'the 
emperor's new clothes' and all. 
</P>
<P>
 "You spend your life doing so many things, then to have someone come out and 
say that it was all an illusion, that it was all smoke and mirrors, that just 
isn't fair. The things we accomplished were real. The Ducks are real. The 
Panthers are real." 
</P>
<P>
 Helping to launch new hockey franchises in Anaheim and Florida was one of the 
many business successes of McNall, who in 1988 bought the Kings outright from 
Jerry Buss. When circumstances obligated him to sell his majority interest, he 
said, Cohen and Sudikoff did not come along looking to capitalize on his 
plight. 
</P>
<P>
 "My ongoing situation with the Kings has a lot to do with the fact that Joe 
and Jeffrey have been incredibly supportive," McNall said. "They have never 
tried to take advantage. They always stood up for me. They have always been 
real menschen in that regard. And I have kept them informed every step of the 
way during this time period, very informed. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the meantime, I've still been right there with the Kings, every step of 
the way, which is exactly where I want to be. It's true, the 100% ownership is 
over and probably won't ever come back. But I chose the best partners possible. 
These are guys who can bring the Kings to new heights, something I couldn't do 
on my own." 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen said he valued McNall's participation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Kings have been very, very busy this off-season," Cohen said. "New 
management arrived. We hired Sam McMaster as general manager. We traded for 
Rick Tocchet. We had our first high first-round draft choice in a long while 
and got an exciting young goaltender. We're in the process of re-signing Rob 
Blake. We just completed an agreement with our new affiliation in Phoenix. 
We've had a lot on our plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point is, Bruce McNall is still very much a part of everything this 
organization is doing. The way I see it, Bruce is the fan's ombudsman. He's got 
that very special gift of being able to relate to the fans, and they to him." 
</P>
<P>
 The cheerful demeanor for which McNall is known hasn't deserted him, even when 
his name and face have been splashed all over the front of the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the bad news," McNall said. "I guess the good news is, if it was on 
the back page, nobody would read it."

JIM MURRAY: KIRALY IS ON THE BALL ON THE SAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If he were in basketball, they'd call him "Magic." In baseball, he'd be "the 
Man" or maybe even "the Thumper." In tennis, he might be "Boom Boom." In golf, 
maybe "the Hawk." 
</P>
<P>
 He'd probably have a shoe contract like Air Jordan -- except his sport doesn't 
wear shoes. Like Lawrence of Arabia, his domain is the burning sand. He has 
been in more sand than a camel. 
</P>
<P>
 What he is, is kind of a complicated beachcomber. Oh, he doesn't spend his 
time waiting for the copra boat or even searching for the perfect wave. He 
spends more time at the beach than a sea gull. If it weren't for sunblock, he'd 
probably be a char. 
</P>
<P>
 He plays a court game but he doesn't need a racket. In his case, the racket 
has five fingers and comes attached. And the ball is not this fuzzy little 
thing about the size of an orange, it's a big leather ball about the size of a 
soccer ball. Hitting it can have all the thrills of smashing a fist into a 
cement block wall. 
</P>
<P>
 The players call him "Double-K" or just "KK" as in killer. His game is 
volleyball and he just might be the best there is at it at the moment, if you 
count the evidence of two Olympic gold medals, more than 90 open titles and 
$1.57 million in prize money. 
</P>
<P>
 Karch Kiraly (pronounced "Kar-eye') is one of those guys they'll name a trophy 
or award after one of these years. Like the Cy Young in baseball or the Lady 
Byng in hockey, the Kiraly will stand for consistent excellence. There'll be 
legends. Some day, they'll tell you he had the vertical jump of a springbok and 
that he once spiked a ball so deep in the sand they never found it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a lot of people are surprised to find it out, volleyball is as 
American an invention as apple pie. But, while it never seemed to make much 
headway in its home country, it grew by leaps and bounds overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 But what really moved the sport out of agate type and onto Page 1 (and Channel 
9) was the beach version. 
</P>
<P>
 It historically was played indoors like basketball and hockey -- a six-player 
game that, between Olympics and like the javelin throw, didn't have much total 
impact on the sports scene. 
</P>
<P>
 It began to be played recreationally on the Southern California littoral by 
the hang-10 hunks looking for something to do waiting for the surf to be up. 
The two-man game caught on at once. Instead of the five-set marathons of the 
indoor games, it had a one-set war that had all the urgency and high excitement 
of sudden death. Television even insisted on a clock that limited a game to 
nine minutes of playing time or about one hour of elapsed time. 
</P>
<P>
 It was perceived as a kind of dilettante sport. Not polo, exactly, but not 
Dempsey-Tunney or Ali-Frazier, either. But it did have its scent of 
head-to-head competition of, say, Budge-Perry or Sampras-Becker. The players 
made prizefighters look flabby.  
</P>
<P>
 Basketball grabbed the headlines with its "Mr. Clutches" and "Big O's and Big 
E's and Big Dippers" and "Magics and Air Jordans" while volleyball got its 
audiences from people looking for seashells or places to stick the umbrellas. 
</P>
<P>
 But all that changed when television people came sniffing around for product. 
They liked what they saw. The ball was highly visible, no hockey puck here. The 
action was constant, the bodies were all hard, the game glamorous.  
</P>
<P>
 The graph could only go up. The beach game caught on as the hardcourt version 
languished and you had incongruities like entrepreneurs bringing in truckloads 
of sand and dumping them on the floor of Madison Square Garden. They'd recreate 
the beach at Santa Monica in places like Cincinnati, where the only surf was 
the Ohio River. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiraly learned the game on the golden sands of Santa Barbara, but he was not 
your basic son of the rich. Dad had gotten out of Hungary one jump ahead of 
Khrushchev's tanks in the Budapest uprising of 1956 and fled to America, where 
he became a civil engineer and then a doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 There were never any white flags in the Kiraly family as Soviet marksmen could 
attest, and Karch plays the kind of all-court game that moved an opponent to 
blurt, "Why is it with K you feel you have your back to the wall when you're up 
11-2?" 
</P>
<P>
 He and partner Kent Steffes have won 14 of 18 tournaments this year and go in 
as favorites at the $1-million Miller Lite Championships at Hermosa Beach this 
weekend, with $100,000 going to the winning team as well as dispersal of 
$750,000 in bonus money for the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a lot of money to make in your bare feet.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL '94 / SEASON PREVIEWS; TROJANS HAVE TALENT -- AND A CHALLENGE; 
USC: RECORD-SETTING QUARTERBACK ROB JOHNSON WILL LEAD THE WAY THROUGH A TOUGH 
SCHEDULE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 USC's 1994 football team, by unanimous vote of every coach on the staff, every 
player and even the most skeptical of Trojan partisans, is significantly better 
than the 1993 team that went 8-5.  
</P>
<P>
 But here's the downside: The schedule is rated the nation's toughest in one 
poll. 
</P>
<P>
 USC plays five 1993 bowl teams: Notre Dame, Penn State, UCLA, Arizona and 
California.  
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans begin Sept. 3 against Washington at the Coliseum, then travel to 
Penn State the next weekend. Then come Pacific 10 games at Oregon State, 
Stanford and Washington State. 
</P>
<P>
 The big crunch comes near the finish, when on consecutive November weekends, 
USC plays Arizona, UCLA and Notre Dame. The Irish, who have beaten the Trojans 
11 years in a row, conclude USC's schedule Nov. 26 at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 So, how opportune for John Robinson, in the second season of his second USC 
term, to have in place an outstanding recruiting class, to have a 
record-breaking quarterback returning and talent and experience nearly anywhere 
he looks. 
</P>
<P>
 Recruiting analysts give the Trojans high marks for its freshman and junior 
college haul of last spring, and as many as a dozen of those recruits will play 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 USC has 10 starters back, six on offense, four on defense.  
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans, who lost in the final minute to UCLA last season, 27-21, 
nonetheless shared the Pac-10 title with the Bruins and Arizona with a 6-2 
mark, then beat Utah in the Freedom Bowl, 28-21. 
</P>
<P>
 For 1994, here's the best of it: QUARTERBACK 
</P>
<P>
 USC has been playing football since 1888, yet no Trojan quarterback ever came 
close to Rob Johnson's productivity in 1993. His 3,630 yards passing last year 
shattered the old record of 2,812 by Rodney Peete in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-4, 220-pound senior is poised for a run at the Heisman Trophy, if 
his team puts together a big season, which would almost have to include 
victories over UCLA and Notre Dame. Johnson, in throwing for a school-record 29 
touchdowns, completed 68.6% of his passes -- another record, by a wide margin. 
</P>
<P>
 He believes, however, that he can take this team to the Rose Bowl with lower 
numbers than he registered last season.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think our running game is going to be more effective this year, and that 
will mean I won't need to throw as often," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, Johnson and offensive coordinator Mike Riley believe that talent at 
wide receiver and tight end will more than make up for the loss of graduated 
Johnnie Morton, who caught 88 passes last season. RECEIVERS 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Grace, who caught 36 passes in '93, and Ed Hervey, who caught 22, are 
proven performers. And the addition of junior college transfer Keyshawn 
Johnson, who caught 55 passes in nine games last year at West L.A. College, 
gives USC a premier group.  
</P>
<P>
 Johnson has enormous potential, Robinson says. 
</P>
<P>
 Also new are untested sprinters Anthony Volsan, a redshirt last season, and 
freshmen Ken Haslip and Larry Parker.  
</P>
<P>
 Returning veterans are Ryan Lenderman and DelVaughn Alexander.  
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans are probably deeper at tight end than at any other position. The 
tight end in motion, or H back, will be Johnny McWilliams, a 245-pound junior 
who caught 17 passes last year, backed up by Tyler Cashman. John Allred figures 
to start at tight end, backed up by Jeff Diltz. 
</P>
<P>
 Trojan tight ends caught 79 passes last season, or roughly three times as many 
as in Coach Larry Smith's final season. The expectation is that the number will 
grow again this year. OFFENSIVE LINE 
</P>
<P>
 Mastodon football has returned to USC. Tackles Tony Boselli (6-7 1/2, 320 
pounds) and Norberto Garrido (6-7, 305) and guard Phalen Pounds (6-7, 310) have 
all had productive training camps. The runts up front will be guard Kris 
Pollack (6-5, 290) and center Jeremy Hogue (6-4, 270).  
</P>
<P>
 When Robinson speaks of "physically dominating defenses" these are the guys 
he's talking about. 
</P>
<P>
 There is depth everywhere here, including three players who have started: 
Robert Loya, who is nursing an injured foot, Clay Hattabaugh and Kyle Ramsay. 
</P>
<P>
 The best is Boselli, a two-time All-American who hopes to complete his first 
uninjured season. He sat out five games because of a dislocated kneecap last 
year. TAILBACK 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson went through half a season last year before he found his tailback. 
Scott Fields and David Dotson faltered early, setting the stage for freshman 
Shawn Walters. 
</P>
<P>
 In late-season games last year, Walters gained 60, 116 and 70 yards against 
Stanford, Washington and Utah. Walters was one of Robinson's most intensive 
coaching projects last season. 
</P>
<P>
 A fast 225-pounder, Walters had a natural inclination to go for the sideline 
on runs up the middle, and Robinson finally persuaded him to be more physical. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshmen Delon Washington and Rodney Sermons and junior college transfer 
Leonard Green have all had outstanding camps. LINEBACKERS 
</P>
<P>
 If there has been a training camp star, it has been junior linebacker Errick 
Herrin, a 225-pounder from Mt. San Jacinto College, and four years in the 
Marines before that.  
</P>
<P>
 Senior Donn Cunnigan will start at Herrin's inside linebacker position against 
Washington, because he's a fifth-year senior. But after that, as defensive 
coordinator Don Lindsey put it, "all bets are off."  
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey calls Herrin explosive, and Robinson says, "He has a suddenness to his 
game that really catches your eye." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Herrin is compared, in whispers at this stage, to Richard Wood, 
All-American linebacker from the early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 USC has a solid, proven corps of linebackers. Two returnees, Brian Williams 
and Jeff Kopp, were 1-2 in tackles a year ago. Errol Small and junior college 
transfer Israel Ifeanyi, a Nigerian, will get considerable playing time.  
</P>
<P>
 Returnee Gerald Caruthers broke a bone in his foot just before training camp 
and will sit out some early games. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the soft or questionable areas: DEFENSIVE LINE 
</P>
<P>
 A weak spot last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomers have shown promise, but there is little experience. Sophomore Matt 
Keneley, who started nine games as a freshman, is thought to have a bright 
future. He began training camp listed at defensive end and nose guard.  
</P>
<P>
 Defensive end Elic Mahone sat out last season after undergoing shoulder 
surgery, but the 250-pounder has shown great pass-rush speed. He is competing 
with JC transfer Marcus Bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Stu Gage, a 300-pounder, was converted from offense to nose tackle late last 
season. Sophomore Willie Lowery will push Keneley early.  
</P>
<P>
 Two freshmen have had outstanding camps. Darrell Russell is a 300-pound 
18-year-old with a 28-inch vertical leap who has held his own with the best of 
Robinson's offensive line. So has George Perry, a 260-pounder. 
</P>
<P>
 A high Robinson priority is stopping the run. Can this group do it? There is 
some doubt here. KICKERS 
</P>
<P>
 Cole Ford has one of the strongest legs in football. In practice the other 
day, the 6-2 senior's kickoff not only went through the uprights, but cleared a 
40-foot-high net behind the goal posts.  
</P>
<P>
 But Ford, who is 20 for 38 on field-goal attempts, had a troubled 1993. Back 
problems kept him out of seven games, but he is injury-free now. 
</P>
<P>
 If he struggles, however, USC can turn to one the nation's most highly sought 
high school kickers, Adam Abrams of La Jolla Bishop's. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson was disappointed overall in punter John Stonehouse's '93 season, but 
Stonehouse had his moments. He averaged 38.3 yards a punt, but six went more 
than 50 yards and his 67-yarder at Washington in the waning moments helped 
preserve a 22-17 victory. It was the longest USC punt in 33 years. FULLBACK 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson has been noncommittal about fullback, possibly because he has so many 
talented tailbacks.  
</P>
<P>
 Historically, young tailbacks hate being moved to fullback. Still, someone has 
to play the position, and it most likely won't be Mark Farlin, who is No. 1 on 
the depth chart.  
</P>
<P>
 Taso Papadakis was switched from fullback to linebacker last spring but will 
still play fullback on short-yardage plays.  
</P>
<P>
 One theory: If someone besides Walters sparkles early as a running back, 
Walters might be moved to fullback.  
</P>
<P>
 Another theory: Sophomore Dotson, an excellent pass blocker, is headed to 
fullback. 
</P>
<P>
 Still another: Robinson will start the season with a two-tailback backfield, 
Walters and Green.  
</P>
<P>
 Robinson has a ready-made sales pitch, if he decides he wants a full-time 
fullback.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year, senior Deon Strother was almost disconsolate when he got the word 
he was being moved to fullback.  
</P>
<P>
 Strother played superbly at the position, however, and as a result was drafted 
by the Denver Broncos. He was cut Tuesday, but it's not likely he would have 
been drafted as a tailback.  
</P>
<P>
 The most talked-about challenge for this team is the running game. Let Johnson 
and the receivers put a lead on the board, so the theory goes, then grind the 
opposition down on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Boselli: "If we can run the ball much better than we did last year, then 
no one will be able to stop us. We already have the best quarterback in the 
country."

COLLEGE FOOTBALL '94 / SEASON PREVIEWS; J.J. RETURNS, BUT BALANCE IS INITIAL 
IDEA; UCLA: STOKES WILL BE THE MAN TO WATCH FOR BRUINS, WHO WOULD LIKE TO RUN 
THE BALL A LITTLE BIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 All together now, repeat after Terry Donahue: 
</P>
<P>
 "You win football games with balanced offense."  
</P>
<P>
 But his new offensive coordinator at UCLA, Bob Toledo, a former quarterback, 
feels liberated after coaching at run-oriented Texas A&M, and passing 60 times 
a game would be fine with him. 
</P>
<P>
 He has J.J. Stokes, one of the top receivers in the nation, and Kevin Jordan, 
a highly regarded sophomore wideout.  
</P>
<P>
 He has Wayne Cook, the first returning Bruin quarterback starter since Tommy 
Maddox left early for the NFL. And Cook led them to the Rose Bowl, an 8-4 
record and a Pacific 10 championship tie with USC and Arizona, both of whom 
UCLA beat. 
</P>
<P>
 He has 310-pound left tackle Jonathan Ogden back to protect Cook's back. Ogden 
already has NFL scouts antsy. 
</P>
<P>
 And he has a banged-up group of running backs. Skip Hicks, the best of them, 
is probably out for the season after slipping on a wet long-jumping board in 
the spring and wrecking his knee. 
</P>
<P>
 The elements are there for a UCLA aerial circus. Donahue as ringmaster? 
</P>
<P>
 Not in this lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to try to take advantage of J.J. Stokes, and at least in the early 
going we're going to have to ride the arm of Wayne Cook and hope we can protect 
him," Donahue said. "But you win football games. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to throw more, but I know you have to have a balanced offense to win 
football games," Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have to have a balanced offense to win," Toledo said. 
</P>
<P>
 They learn it before they learn the alma mater at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 When you talk about the Bruins, you begin with Stokes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a big-play guy," Toledo said, "and you've got to get the ball in the 
hands of big-play guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes caught 82 passes for 1,191 yards and 17 touchdowns last season, 
including 14 catches for 176 yards -- both Rose Bowl records -- against 
Wisconsin. Big plays such as a 95-yard catch and run against Washington spawned 
something of a legend and made him the No. 7 vote-getter in the Heisman Trophy 
balloting. Nos. 1-6 are in the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 Can he have that type of season again? 
</P>
<P>
 Probably not, because teams will be outdoing themselves in defensive 
innovation, all seeking to keep him from beating them. Toledo must find a way 
to keep Stokes from being double-covered all season. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive subtraction of Stokes could mean additional offense from Jordan, who 
caught 45 passes for 612 yards and two touchdowns in 1993; and Mike Nguyen, who 
caught 26 passes, at least one in every game, for 300 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 It also could mean a big season for the backs. 
</P>
<P>
 With Hicks out, Sharmon Shah returns as the No. 1 tailback, but both of his 
knees have been surgically repaired, and the right one swelled in preseason. 
Another operation is possible. Derek Ayers is next in line, nine pounds heavier 
and a year older, but he, too, has a leg problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Daron Washington? He has had moments at No. 1 tailback, but is pushing James 
Milliner at fullback now. If Shah and Ayers can't play, Washington might move 
back where he started, this time as a senior tailback, sharing time with 
freshman Shaun Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was in the defensive backfield before he became an instant running 
back when Shah and Ayers went down. He has been impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 If Washington plays tailback, freshman Greg Ford, 5-10 and 255, could get a 
lot of playing time at fullback.  
</P>
<P>
 UCLA has had only one 1,000-yard season, from Kevin Williams, with 1,141 in 
1991, since Gaston Green left in 1987, and this season probably won't produce 
the second. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, a coach would prefer to have a 1,000-yard runner, because then you 
know you have a good player that you can count on," Donahue said. "But you know 
I'm not afraid to roll backs." 
</P>
<P>
 Rolling them produced a 1993 season in which six players gained more than 200 
yards, but only Hicks and Ricky Davis had more than 500. Still, there were only 
three 1,000-yard backs in the Pac-10 -- Napoleon Kaufman at Washington, Mario 
Bates at Arizona State and Lindsey Chapman at California -- and none played in 
the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Whoever lines up behind Cook will be given an opportunity to catch the ball. 
Only 18 passes were caught by backs, for 85 yards last season. Barring 
misfortune, there will more before conference play rolls around, in the 
season's fourth game. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the product of Toledo's emphasis on the short-passing game, which has a 
partial goal of increasing Cook's completion percentage from 55% a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 There is concern up front, where Ogden returns, but where Craig Novitsky and 
Vaughn Parker, both all-conference players, became NFL draft picks. James 
Christensen, last year's starting center until the second game, when he injured 
a knee against Nebraska, steps in for Novitsky at left guard, and Mike Flanagan 
returns bigger and stronger at center. Matt Soenksen, the team's strongest 
player, is the right guard, and junior Mike Rohme or senior Paul Kennedy 
replaces Parker at right tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Gully is the most experienced reserve, and he is a redshirt freshman who 
is being called on to back up several positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Richards is the most experienced tight end. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensively, holes abound, but so do replacements. The holes were created when 
pass-rushing linebacker Jamir Miller and safety Marvin Goodwin went to the NFL 
after their junior seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Experience on defense is up front, where lightweight nose guard George Kase, 
listed at 255 pounds but probably lighter, will be outweighed by everybody he 
faces. He is being pushed by Travis Kirschke, also a lightweight last season 
but now 20 pounds heavier at 275. 
</P>
<P>
 The tackles are 310-pound Sale Isaia and Gary Walton, with London Woodfin 
rehabilitating a leg injury but able to play. Grady Stretz also provides depth. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Phillip Ward is being asked to replace Miller and rush a complete 
roster of returning Pac-10 quarterbacks. Anthony Jones, a transfer from Notre 
Dame, is pushing Ward and could supplant him. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward and Jones will be able to rush the passer because Donnie Edwards returns 
at the other outside linebacker and handles pass coverage. He is the leading 
returning tackler, with 63 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 The inside backers are Shane Jasper and Rod Smalley. Jasper played much of the 
1993 season behind Carrick O'Quinn, coming in on the game's second series and 
playing most of the rest of the way. Smalley is moving to the middle after 
playing behind Miller, which means he is experienced because of Miller's 
injuries and off-field problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The secondary was a problem as preseason camp began, but might be less so 
because of the emergence of some talented freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
 The veterans are cornerbacks Carl Greenwood and Teddy Lawrence, and the new 
safeties are Abdul McCullough, a sophomore who likes to hit, and Paul Guidry, a 
speedy sophomore who was second in the Pac-10 in punt returns last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Colbert, Ted Nwoke and Aaron Roques provide depth and will play a lot in 
the specialty coverages in the pass-happy Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
 The kicking is in good hands. All-American Bjorn Merten was successful on 21 
of 26 field-goal tries as a freshman in 1993. Darren Schager was all-Pac-10 as 
the punter. 
</P>
<P>
 The schedule includes Nebraska at Lincoln, and most of the tougher Pac-10 
games are also on the road, including those at Berkeley, Seattle and Tucson. 
USC will be played at the Rose Bowl, which is twice as far from Westwood as the 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins open at the Rose Bowl with Tennessee and Southern Methodist, a 
good-news, bad-news lineup, before heading for Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had my druthers, I'd play three teams we could dominate and play a lot 
of players to get ready for the conference season," Donahue said. But Cal State 
Fullerton and Long Beach State are out of the football business, so it's 
Tennessee, SMU and Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 And then the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
 And then? 
</P>
<P>
 What's enough? After UCLA had lost, 21-16, to Wisconsin in the Rose Bowl, 
Stokes turned to Cook and said, "We'll be back next year and this time we'll 
get a 'W.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Then Jones talked to them both to learn about the importance of Pasadena and 
New Year's Day. He wondered about the T-shirts and slogans and other 
motivational memorabilia surrounding the UCLA program, extolling the Bruins to 
the Rose Bowl, as though it were the Holy Grail. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, calling upon his Notre Dame experience, started selling a different 
line. There's more, he told Stokes and Cook, the UCLA leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 They're buying. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to win all of our games this year," Stokes said. 
</P>
<P>
 You mean, you want to go back to the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to win all of our games," he repeated.

FRONTIERE NOW ALL BUSINESS; RAMS: SHE SAYS SHE WANTS TO KEEP THE TEAM IN 
ANAHEIM BUT DOESN'T HOLD MUCH HOPE THAT SHE CAN AFFORD TO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ram owner Georgia Frontiere said Wednesday she remains open to keeping her 
team in Anaheim but believes it no longer possible, especially if Orange County 
fails to build her a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does come down to staying in business; I wouldn't dream of leaving if I 
could stay in business," Frontiere said on the day the Save the Rams task force 
made a formal pitch to team management. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is always hope, but unless something drastically changes I don't see 
how we can. You know when the bankers start saying this is it, you have to 
start listening to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Area officials and businessmen were given their hearing Wednesday. In a 
two-hour meeting at the team's Pico Boulevard offices in Los Angeles, Ram 
President John Shaw received a proposal from local representatives, including a 
remodeled Anaheim Stadium and a new practice facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the plan falls short of offering the new stadium the team covets, 
task force members nonetheless expressed optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was happy not to get tossed out of the office," Orange County Supervisor 
William G. Steiner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Newport Beach sports agent Leigh Steinberg, the group's co-chairman: "I 
thought it was a productive meeting. They appeared interested and intrigued by 
some of the elements of the proposal. . . . They said they needed time to 
analyze it and they would get back to us in a couple weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw remained characteristically noncommittal in assessing how the offer 
stacked up against lucrative proposals from cities such as Baltimore and St. 
Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a preliminary negotiating meeting during which the 'Save the Rams' 
organization made a financial proposal for keeping the Rams in Anaheim," Shaw 
said in a one-paragraph statement. "We are reviewing their proposal and 
anticipate other meetings with the 'Save the Rams' organization." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, who have suffered more than a 35% drop in season-ticket sales while 
substantially boosting their payroll with free-agent acquisitions, have 
projected a $6-million loss this season. Frontiere earlier empowered Shaw to 
explore the possibility of moving the team in time to play elsewhere next year. 
</P>
<P>
 She reacted cautiously to Save the Rams' efforts to prevent that from 
happening. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how real any of these things are, but certainly they have the 
right intentions," said Frontiere, who did not attend Wednesday's meeting. "I 
think as long as negotiations are open, again, where there's light, there's 
hope. I mean we're exploring all the options. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is we have a wonderful country that allows us to go where we can 
make a living." 
</P>
<P>
 But Frontiere said any proposal that is intended to keep the team here will 
probably have to include a new stadium. And she said she might be willing to 
accept a minority partner to get one built. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone had that much of an interest, I would be agreeable to selling a 
minority part of the team," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Save the Rams members declined to discuss the details of its offer, it 
is known to include: 
</P>
<P>
 * A revamped football-only Anaheim Stadium with improved sight lines to the 
field, more than 100 luxury boxes and lucrative club seating with waiter 
service. That would entail building a new stadium for the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 * A new club corporate headquarters and practice facility. 
</P>
<P>
 * A $50-million infusion of cash in the form of a minority purchase of the 
team. Some Save the Rams members have indicated that 10 yet-to-be-chosen 
investors, from inside and outside the group, will contribute $5 million each 
to buy a part of the team. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the cities hoping to get the Rams have made new stadiums part of their 
offers. 
</P>
<P>
 But Frontiere said that she has not made a deal to move the team to Baltimore 
or St. Louis. "We're not even close," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis continues to be plagued by an internal dispute regarding its stadium 
lease. In Baltimore, Peter Angelos, managing partner of the Baltimore Orioles, 
expressed an interest in buying a minority interest in the Rams. But those 
negotiations broke off when Angelos insisted upon majority ownership at some 
point in time. 
</P>
<P>
 Frontiere insists she will not part with the team she has run since her 
husband, Carroll Rosenbloom, drowned in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the trouble," Frontiere said. "From Day 1 when Carroll died, people 
have been trying to buy my team. I'm not going to sell a majority interest in 
the team, no, no, a thousand times, no." 
</P>
<P>
 But she said she will consider selling a minority interest to facilitate a 
move to another city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would want a partner that I could get along with and work with," she said. 
"Right now I really don't have any idea where we're going to go. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything can happen. If somebody suddenly came along here and said they were 
going to build us a new stadium . . . it would probably take all of LA and 
Anaheim together to get that kind of thing, but who knows." 
</P>
<P>
 Frontiere, who as a rule stays out of the spotlight, also said Wednesday that 
she wanted to address Ram fans because it was a mistake on her part not to 
attend the team's kickoff luncheon last week. 
</P>
<P>
 She was out of town at the time and under physicians' orders not to fly 
because of an ear infection, "but I could have still tried to come," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It traditionally has been a function for the players, and I didn't realize 
how disappointed people were that I wasn't there until later. I would have 
liked to talk to the fans; I really empathize with them, but I don't want to 
lead anyone on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to give false hope. It's tough right now, and I don't know how I 
can make someone feel better when they're probably going to lose their team. 
It's very hard. You can feel sympathy, but then people say, 'If you really feel 
sorry, why would you go?' 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my home. I don't want to go, but what can we do?" 
</P>

MORNING BRIEFING: MAYBE THESE FANS SHOULDN'T GET READY FOR SOME FOOTBALL

 Memphis has been burned several times by the NFL's talk about expanding into 
the Tennessee city, and at least one resident seems to be striking back. 
</P>
<P>
 When Commissioner Paul Tagliabue enthused that it would be realistic to think 
about putting a team in Mexico City after a Dallas-Houston exhibition game had 
drawn more than 100,000 to Azteca Stadium, columnist Al Dunning of the Memphis 
Commercial Appeal was not the least surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wish to remind our Mexican neighbors that the gringo in charge of the NFL 
sometimes talks a better game than he delivers," Dunning wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know; we just fell for the same kind of pitch that's beginning to 
mesmerize Mexicans. So if the NFL cons Mexico City the way it did us, Mexicans 
shouldn't take it personally and invade El Paso."

 When retired New York Giant linebacker Lawrence Taylor visited the New England 
Patriots and his former coach, Bill Parcells, they staged a news conference 
that was more Abbott and Costello than fourth and goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if Taylor was going to join Parcells' coaching staff, Taylor zinged, 
"I've seen Bill coach, so I know it's got to be an easy job." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, when Taylor was quizzed about Parcells' weight loss, he said, "He's 
looking light and doing very well. I can see he's not spending as much time at 
McDonald's. Isn't that right, Twiggy?" 
</P>
<P>
 They mean it in a nice way: The Houston Oilers really miss offensive lineman 
Doug Dawson, who is now with the Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 Just listen: "A lot of Houston-area businesses are going to be hurt without 
Doug promoting them by wearing their caps and T-shirts on television," guard 
Kevin Donnalley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doug might have to pay for a few meals, now that he's the enemy. He's not 
going to be able to run down the street and eat the all-you-can-eat Chinese 
buffet for free any more." 
</P>
<P>
 Said center Bruce Matthews: "Mr. (owner Bud) Adams will have to find somebody 
else to do his gardening. Doug's his own man, and he's not afraid to show it. 
He'd kiss up to whoever he had to." 
</P>
<P>
 Add Dawson: Actually, Dawson was quite popular in Houston. Matthews explains 
why: 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of fond memories about Doug. The thing I remember most was the 
time last year when it was pouring rain. To collect a bet, Doug belly-flopped 
in the water on the practice field wearing only his jock."

REPORT DISPUTES OWNERS; TALKS: STANFORD PROFESSOR CLAIMS TEAMS UNDERESTIMATED 
REVENUE. RAVITCH SAYS IT AVOIDS THE CENTRAL ISSUE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 An economic report prepared for the baseball players union by Stanford 
professor Roger Noll disputes many of the owners' financial claims. Noll 
prepared a similar study for the union in 1985 with similar conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 The union, as reported by The Times on Wednesday, mailed copies of the study 
to the 28 clubs earlier this week. It was distributed to the media here 
Wednesday, but the confidential figures were edited out. This much was learned: 
</P>
<P>
 Noll claims the owners have underestimated their 1994 revenue by $50 million 
to $140 million. He claims that their reported profits of $50 million in 1993 
were at least $50 million more than that. He claims that every owner realized, 
on average, $10 million in cash between 1991 and '93. 
</P>
<P>
 "Noll concludes that total compensation is not increasing faster than revenue, 
as the owners have maintained," said Donald Fehr, the union's executive 
director. "According to his finding, the industry's overall health is better 
than it was in the mid-'80s." 
</P>
<P>
 Said owners negotiator Richard Ravitch: "You can argue numbers until you're 
blue in the face, but that's not the issue (in the collective bargaining 
talks). The owners don't have to prove poverty to have the right to know what 
their labor costs are going to be and to establish a relationship between those 
costs and revenue." 
</P>
<P>
 John Harrington, CEO of the Boston Red Sox and spokesman for the 12 owners and 
club executives who have joined the bargaining talks, said Noll simply reached 
the conclusions "the union paid him to reach." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrington charged Noll with a biased product that is strictly "a sideshow to 
the central issues" of the talks and said the 28 accountants who prepared the 
clubs' books and whose reports Noll has "recharacterized" would all disagree 
with Noll's findings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since I'm also a CPA, that makes 29 who disagree," Harrington said.

THEY GET TOGETHER, BUT NOT ON ISSUES; BASEBALL: PLAYERS AND OWNERS FINALLY 
TALK, BUT NO PROGRESS IS REPORTED IN SETTLING STRIKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Players and owners went eye to eye for the first time in baseball's stalemated 
collective bargaining talks Wednesday, but there was still no indication they 
are seeing eye to eye. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no progress and no change of position on Day 13 of the players 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
 The talks, however, will resume this morning under the auspices of federal 
mediators, and both sides seemed to feel that an improved tone was established 
during a seven-hour meeting in which 12 owners and club executives expressed 
their need for a new compensation system and five of the 21 players in 
attendance -- Paul Molitor, Brett Butler, Curt Schilling, Kevin Brown and Scott 
Sanderson -- explained their opposition to a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Molitor later: "The owners made some heartfelt and emotional 
presentations about the economic concerns they feel need to be addressed, but 
the players said, 'Yes, we know some teams are being squeezed, but we don't 
think this proposal solves the problems.' 
</P>
<P>
 "We told them they were asking the players to solve problems (through the cap) 
that they should solve themselves (through increased revenue sharing not linked 
to a cap). There will be no baseball as long as the cap is on the table." 
</P>
<P>
 Billed as the first negotiating session since the strike began on Aug. 12, 
there was no real negotiation, only statements of policy, position and 
historical perspective. Donald Fehr, executive director of the Major League 
Players Assn., is said to have spoken for almost two hours about previous 
negotiations -- this is the eighth stoppage since 1972 -- and the players' long 
fight to win rights and freedom threatened by a proposal that would destroy 
free agency and put artificial restraints on a free market. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the kind of meeting that you might expect at the preliminary stage 
of bargaining, several weeks, if not more than that, before a strike deadline, 
not 12 days into a strike," Fehr said at a news conference, adding that it 
probably should have been held even before the owners reopened the negotiations 
a year early, in December of 1992, and certainly before they made their 
proposal on May 23 of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still shaping up as a very long process," Fehr said. "There is no 
indication the owners want a quick resolution." 
</P>
<P>
 Owners negotiator Richard Ravitch agreed in part, saying there will be no 
progress until the players address the owners' need for cost certainty and the 
relationship between revenue and compensation. He described the meeting -- 
interrupted several times when the teams separated to caucus or confer with the 
mediators -- as civil and intelligent, but said it did not address those 
central issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, that will happen tomorrow, but I don't think you can expect any 
instant changes," Ravitch said. Nevertheless, some players came away with a 
feeling that the owners have begun to show some flexibility regarding the cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Butler, the Dodgers' assistant player representative: "I didn't get the 
feeling from them that they were saying, 'This is the way it's got to be,' and 
that's an improvement. I mean, there were some voices raised, and frustration 
expressed, but I thought it was positive and constructive. After 14 years (of 
his involvement in labor issues), it was refreshing to have 12 representatives 
of the owners across the table." 
</P>
<P>
 If that feeling of flexibility is legitimate, it may stem from what seems to 
be a conscious attempt by the owners to avoid reference to a salary cap per se, 
and to draw the union out regarding alternative proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Did all 12 owners and executives refer specifically to a cap during their 
presentations Wednesday? 
</P>
<P>
 "Some did and some didn't," said Gene Orza, the union's associate general 
counsel. "Maybe that's a good sign." 
</P>
<P>
 Boston Red Sox CEO John Harrington said the ability to project labor costs by 
a pre-established link between revenue and compensation "doesn't have to come 
through a salary cap." He said there are alternatives based on tax plans and 
salary scales among other things, and that the owners continue to hope the 
union will address those. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternatives? "A rose by any other name is still a rose," Fehr said, adding 
that when the union offered alternatives devoid of a cap or a defined 
percentage of revenue going to salaries, they were quickly rejected by the 
owners. "Our position has always been that the free market should establish 
what the players receive," he said. "If salaries decrease in a free market, so 
be it. The players are prepared to live with that." 
</P>
<P>
 John Calhoun Wells, national director of the Federal Mediation and 
Conciliation Service, commended the owners and players on their "professional 
and problem solving" deportment as talks resumed, but where it leads is still 
uncertain.

 Pitcher Matt Turner, who continues to undergo chemotherapy treatments for 
Hodgkin's disease, was released Wednesday by the Cleveland Indians so that he 
can receive the remainder of his contract, a team official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner, acquired in an April 3 trade with the Florida Marlins, pitched for the 
Indians and their triple-A team in Charlotte, N.C., before being found to have 
the disease on May 25. 
</P>
<P>
 "Matt is still undergoing his treatments, and his wife Kathy is expecting 
their third child," said Indian General Manager John Hart. "This allows us to 
pay him the remainder of his contract. Matt is still very much a part of the 
Cleveland Indians." 
</P>
<P>
 The team and Turner are discussing terms of a contract for the 1995 season, 
Hart said.

LEWIS STARTING OVER AS NON-STARTER; PRO FOOTBALL: RAIDERS, HOWEVER, KEEP 
OPTIONS OPEN FOR FORMER CHIEF GREAT IN GRAND SCHEME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a 1994 home video football game, Albert Lewis is a starting cornerback on 
the Kansas City Chiefs' all-time team. 
</P>
<P>
 With his trademark No. 29, Lewis flies around the Chiefs' secondary making 
interceptions and tackles while playing on the same defense as NFL Hall of 
Famers Willie Lanier, Bobby Bell and Buck Buchanan. Lewis was a four-time Pro 
Bowl selection in 11 seasons with Kansas City and is the Chiefs' all-time punt 
block leader with 11. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem for Lewis, however, is that he finished his career with the Chiefs 
last March when he signed as an unrestricted free agent with the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not something that I've spent a whole lot of time thinking about," said 
Lewis, who was drafted by Kansas City in the third round in 1983 from 
Grambling. "But it is an odd feeling knowing that I've spent so many years 
there. At some point of time, I may reopen the book and look back." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Lewis is trying to become a starter for the Raiders, something he was 
not promised when he moved to Los Angeles during the off-season. 
</P>
<P>
 With Pro Bowl selection Terry McDaniel at left cornerback and 12-year veteran 
Lionel Washington on the right, the Raiders already had two quality players at 
Lewis' position. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders told Lewis he would only get a chance to compete and nothing was 
going to be given to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having Albert adds a quality cornerback who has the ability to cover and make 
plays," Raider Coach Art Shell said. "He adds experience and toughness, which 
is vitally important to our team." 
</P>
<P>
 So after being a leader and a mainstay on the Chiefs' defense since breaking 
in as a starter in 1984, Lewis realized that he would almost have to start over 
in Los Angeles. Which he knew was not going to be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always difficult to leave after playing in one spot for so long," said 
Lewis, who is third on the all-time active interceptions list with 38. "But 
it's also exciting. The challenge of it all and the opportunity to play for a 
team you've went against for so long." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first things Lewis did when he began practicing with the Raiders 
was to make a deal with second-year safety Patrick Bates, who wore No. 29 last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Bates, who last year made it known that he liked No. 29, drove a hard bargain 
but eventually gave in to Lewis' request. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had so much history with that number," said Lewis, who wore No. 29 
throughout college and his NFL career. "I just had to have it. I wouldn't say 
that it was difficult to have (Bates switch to No. 24), but I would say that it 
was expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Once he had his old number back, Lewis did not take long to show that he had 
not lost a step despite being sidelined with a knee injury in 1991 and a broken 
forearm in 1992. The injuries forced him to miss a combined 15 games after 
missing only five non-strike games in the first eight years of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 feet 2, 195 pounds, Lewis, 33, displayed the same skills that made him a 
consensus All-NFL selection in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that I am a better player now than before because my injuries forced 
me to concentrate and to not take things for granted," Lewis said. "I'm not 
putting myself into situations where I am vulnerable for injury. I am more of a 
technician now." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Raiders reported for training camp in July, they put Lewis at left 
cornerback behind McDaniel while he became familiar with the team's defense, 
instead of putting him in direct competition with Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders moved Lewis to right cornerback before their exhibition game at 
Pittsburgh, which also was the game in which Washington suffered a hamstring 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis has played with the first defense ever since. So when the Raiders take 
the field Saturday at Houston, Lewis won't be complaining while he's in the 
lineup while Washington rests. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, the Raiders have three starters at cornerback," Lewis said. "But, 
if they brought me here solely to be a third-down guy on passing situations, 
they signed the wrong guy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders expect to have Washington back for their regular-season opener 
against San Francisco Sept. 5, and Shell has not indicated there might be a 
starting change once everyone is fit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've said too many times that starting is not too important on this team," 
Shell said. "It's your contribution to make your football team win that is what 
is important." 
</P>
<P>
 Which for Lewis can mean more than just starting at cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
 In his career, Lewis has made a living blocking kicks. Five times his blocks 
turned into touchdowns and twice he recovered his own blocks for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always prided myself as a special-teams player and I don't think that 
will change this year," Lewis said. "A lot of things have changed around the 
league and it is not as easy as it once was to get blocks, but I think that 
I'll always be out there blocking punts." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Lewis has adjusted well to the Raiders and living in Palos Verdes. The 
only thing he regrets about leaving Kansas City is that he left his horses 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like being out here in California playing for the Raiders, but I'll feel a 
whole lot better once I get my favorite horse (Stetson) out here. And he'll be 
here by Christmas."

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; RESERVES TO GET PLENTY OF PLAYING TIME 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To help ensure that the Raider starters are fit for their season opener at San 
Francisco, Coach Art Shell plans to give a great deal of playing time to 
reserves against Houston on Saturday in their final exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell said Wednesday he is pleased with the team's progress and does not want 
to risk the chance of injury to a starter on the artificial turf of the 
Astrodome. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll get our starters enough work, but our backups will get a lot more 
work," Shell said. "We're in fairly good shape now, but with the nagging 
injuries we have, it's better for us to make sure a guy is healthy by not 
playing on turf." 
</P>
<P>
 So don't look for the Raiders to play cornerbacks Lionel Washington 
(hamstring) and Torin Dorn (hamstring); defensive tackle Chester McGlockton 
(leg) or linebacker James Folston (ankle). 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in better shape than we were at this time last year," Shell said. 
"We've been lucky. But at the same time, we've got in the work we've wanted to 
get in." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One Raider regular who might not get a rest Saturday is linebacker Mike Jones, 
who quietly has emerged as one of the league's top pass coverage linebackers. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Houston's modified run-and-shoot offense, Jones might get a lot of 
work in pass coverage defenses. "I might be in there because of their 
run-and-shoot and from the fact that we have a lot of (defensive backs) hurt," 
said Jones, a four-year veteran who played running back in college at Missouri. 
"One good thing for me is that because we play (Houston) later in the season, 
they probably won't show us too much. They might use a lot of two tight end 
sets, which would be fine with me." 
</P>
<P>
 With so much focus placed on the Raider linebackers during the preseason 
because of second-year veteran Greg Biekert and rookies Rob Fredrickson, Rob 
Holmberg and Folston, Jones has quietly had a solid training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a lot good players on this team, so not being recognized isn't a 
problem," said Jones, who had 39 tackles last season. "I do know that if I stay 
in there and continue to do a good job, after a while, the recognition will 
come." LONNIE WHITE

MARADONA'S BAN WILL PROBABLY END HIS CAREER; SOCCER: FIFA'S 15-MONTH SUSPENSION 
FOR FAILED WORLD CUP DRUG TEST MAKES COMEBACK SLIM FOR ARGENTINE STAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GRAHAME L. JONES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sometimes glittering and always controversial soccer career of Argentina's 
Diego Maradona appears finished. 
</P>
<P>
 In Zurich, Switzerland, on Wednesday, FIFA, soccer's international governing 
body, banished Maradona from the sport for 15 months for failing a drug test 
during this summer's World Cup in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban is the second in three years for the Argentine midfielder, who also 
received a 15-month worldwide suspension in 1991 after testing positive for 
cocaine use in Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest ban, retroactive to June 30, means that Maradona will be one month 
shy of his 35th birthday when it expires on Sept. 29, 1995. By then, it will be 
too late for him to revive his international career and it is unlikely that any 
club team would want to risk signing him. 
</P>
<P>
 Reactions to FIFA's announcement were immediate. In Buenos Aires, Argentine 
President Carlos Menem called it "a kind of persecution" and said he felt FIFA 
had been overly punitive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expected something lighter," Menem said. "We thought expelling him from 
the World Cup had been enough. This looks like too much, a very harsh 
punishment." 
</P>
<P>
 Maradona, meanwhile, was trying to deflect the blame. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can tell these guys at FIFA have no families," he said. "They really 
didn't take anything into consideration." 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA's World Cup Organizing Committee, chaired by Mexico's Guillermo Canedo 
and including members of each of FIFA's six continental confederations, said it 
did its utmost to be fair. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote to suspend Maradona for taking a so-called "cocktail" of five banned 
substances, including the stimulant ephedrine, was unanimous. The player had 
tested positive after Argentina's first-round World Cup victory over Nigeria on 
June 25. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not want to destroy him for his actions," FIFA spokesman Guido Tognoni 
said, "but it was always said we should deal with this case without keeping in 
mind he was Maradona. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case shows FIFA is a credible organization with credible doping tests." 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph (Sepp) Blatter, FIFA's general secretary, said the decision is final 
and no appeal can be made. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the ban, FIFA also fined the player $15,000 -- a token amount 
considering, for example, that Maradona was paid more than $1.3 million by an 
Argentine television network for five minutes of exclusive commentary each day 
during the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Financially, neither the fine nor the ban will affect Maradona, who not long 
ago claimed that his personal finances were such that "my daughters can eat 
caviar for the rest of their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 His pride, however, will have been deeply wounded and it is quite likely that 
he yet again will renounce the sport and retire as he had done four or five 
times in the past when confronted by setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 He almost certainly no longer will be a member of the Argentine national team, 
especially with former coach Alfio Basile having stepped down and with Daniel 
Passarella, a defender on Argentina's 1978 World Cup-winning team, about to 
become coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Passarella's instructions will be to rebuild the Argentine team, with the 
first goal being to defend Argentina's Copa America title next June in Uruguay 
and then, more importantly, to put together a team capable of not only 
qualifying for but actually winning the 1998 World Cup in France. 
</P>
<P>
 Maradona's ban still will be in effect during the Copa America, or South 
American Championship, and he will be well over the hill by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, on the club level, he is unlikely to find himself a particularly 
marketable commodity at 35, especially given his tendency to gain weight and 
lose fitness when he is not playing regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 It might well be his battle to get back in shape in time for World Cup '94 
that prompted him to experiment with the performance-enhancing drugs that 
caused his latest downfall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is absolutely scientifically proved that these products have a positive 
action on the central nervous system, increasing a player's ability and 
physical action," said Michel d'Hooghe, the Belgian who heads FIFA's Medical 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Maradona was not in Zurich to hear FIFA's decision. He was represented by 
Julio Grondona, president of the Argentine soccer federation, and by his 
attorney, Daniel Balotnicoff, who argued that the positive drug test resulted 
from a mix-up in using two similarly named medications. 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA did not buy that excuse and decided after a three-hour, closed-door 
meeting to ban the player who captained Argentina to its World Cup triumph in 
1986 and to second place in 1990.

NEWSWIRE: PERKINS SWIMS TO TWO RECORDS IN ONE RACE

 Australian Kieren Perkins broke two world records in the same race Wednesday, 
winning his fourth gold medal on the final night of swimming at the 
Commonwealth Games at Victoria, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 His time of 14 minutes 41.66 seconds in the 1,500-meter freestyle was more 
than a second faster than the world mark of 14:43.48 he set at the 1992 
Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Perkins, who turned 21 this month, also broke his world 800 mark during the 
race at 7:46.00, bettering the record he set in Sydney in February 1992 by 0.6 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once I got the 800 I was feeling good," Perkins said. "I was feeling pain but 
I was still buoyed by the reaction of the crowd. There was one hell of a dull 
roar coming through the water." 
</P>
<P>
 In swimming, the 800 is considered part of the 1,500 for record purposes. The 
two records have been broken in the same race eight times since 1958. The last 
to do it was Stephen Holland of Australia in 1976. Perkins set the world 800 
record during a 1,500-meter race in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 In track and field competition, Scotland's Yvonne Murray, running her first 
10,000 meters in nine years, shattered the gold-medal hopes of South Africa's 
Elana Meyer, pulling away in the final 500 meters for an easy victory in 31

 Dan Jansen, having finally won an Olympic gold medal and busy with 
endorsements and a new career as a television commentator, announced his 
retirement.

<P>
 "I have accomplished all that I can in my sport," Jansen said in a news 
release from U.S. Speedskating in Milwaukee. "I will miss it, especially the 
competition, but I am looking forward to spending more time with my family." 
</P>
<P>
 Jansen, 29, won a gold medal in the 1,000 meters at Lillehammer, Norway, in 
February, ending his Olympic frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 At the 1988 Games in Calgary, he fell twice after his sister, Jane Jansen 
Beres, died of leukemia hours before his first race. Despite great success in 
international competition, he failed to win a medal in Albertville, France, in 
1992. 
</P>

 Jansen slipped during his 500-meter race at Lillehammer and finished out of

paid, $3-million sabbatical during the 1994-95 season -- some Penguin officials 
are privately wondering if he will ever play hockey again.

<P>
 Michigan State President M. Peter McPherson announced that Spartan Coach 
George Perles, beginning his 12th prickly year at East Lansing, must produce 
"an outstanding season" . . . or else. 
</P>
<P>
 McPherson forgot to mention any specifics, leaving Perles, who has four years 
remaining on a 10-year contract, to twist in the wind. Perles isn't a big fan 
of twisting, which is why he sent a few verbal zingers back to McPherson. 
</P>

WORST CONFERENCE FOR ASPIRING QUARTERBACKS 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific 10. Every starting quarterback from last season returns. BEST 
REASONS TO PICK AUBURN NO. 1 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen starters--nine on defense, five on offense--are back from an 
undefeated team that wants to prove last year's record wasn't a fluke. . . . 
Terry Bowden, consensus national coach of the year in only his first season in 
Division I-A, squeezed an 11-0 mark out of an Auburn program on probation. 
Think what he'll do in his second year and with something to play for, like a 
national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Stephen Davis is a chip off the ol' Bo. . . . Redshirt freshman 
quarterback Dameyune Craig is so good he led the No. 2 Auburn offense to a 
victory against the Auburn No. 1 defense in the spring game. Craig won't start 
the season, but he will finish it. . . . The early season schedule is as soft 
as a down pillow. The Tigers should be 6-0 when they travel to Florida on Oct. 
15. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback Fred Smith, who sat out last season because of a knee injury, is 
back. Smith was Auburn's defensive player of the year in 1992. . . . The best 
punter in the game, Terry Daniel, also returns. Daniel, who averaged 46.9 
yards, so exasperated Mississippi State Coach Jackie Sherrill, that Sherrill 
accused him of kicking helium-filled footballs. . . . Twenty-two consecutive 
victories in one of the country's most difficult conferences can't be ignored. 
. . . The Tigers, still on NCAA probation, are back on TV. WORST REASONS TO 
PICK AUBURN NO. 1 
</P>
<P>
 The 11-0 season was a fluke. . . . NCAA probation prohibits Auburn from 
postseason play, which isn't exactly a selling point to Associated Press 
voters. . . . There are new starters at quarterback, fullback, halfback and 
kicker. . . . Starting cornerback Calvin Jackson, who helped give Auburn the 
Southeastern Conference's best secondary, flunked out. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers travel to Gainesville to play the Gators, to Starkville for 
Mississippi State, to Birmingham for the Crimson Tide. Does anyone really think 
Auburn can beat Florida, Mississippi State and Alabama in consecutive years, 
this time on the road? Well, now that you mention it. . . . WORST FAREWELL 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the freeze-out by the coalition, the historic Cotton Bowl has been 
relegated to has-been status. There is hope, though. If they're smart, Cotton 
Bowl officials will jump at the chance of having the Big 12 championship game 
played in Dallas. BEST GAMES OF THE SEASON 
</P>
<P>
 --SUNDAY 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska vs. West Virginia in the Kickoff Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 The Midwest's most prolific whiners vs. the East's best complainers. That 
said, Nebraska, with quarterback Tommie Frazier, is loaded. Rebuilding West 
Virginia will think it has been in a mining accident.

<P>
 Boston College at Michigan 
</P>
<P>
 Former NFL coach Dan Henning, not exactly the people's choice to succeed Tom 
Coughlin, makes his first appearance on a college sideline in 20 years. Some 
return. He gets 105,000-seat Michigan Stadium and Wolverine running back Tyrone 
Wheatley. Worse, Henning has to choose from among a sophomore, a redshirt 
freshman and a true freshman as his starting quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry. Boston College, with 14 returning starters, will keep it close. 
</P>
<P>
 Louisville at Kentucky 
</P>
<P>
 There's a good reason these two teams haven't met since 1924: Kentucky and 
Louisville despise one another. Back by popular demand, football's version of 
an in-state civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennessee at UCLA 
</P>
<P>
 The survivor becomes an instant threat to challenge for a national 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia at Florida State 
</P>

 Florida State opens its season against a solid Cavalier team and does so 
without some key players, including All-American linebacker Derrick Brooks, one 
of several Seminoles suspended for his part in an NCAA rule-breaking shopping 
spree last year.

 Had it not been for a great Michigan goal-line stand and a Penn State love

Lions would have beaten the Wolverines last year. Now the rematch. 
</P>
<P>

 Memo to Irish Coach Lou Holtz: We don't want to hear a peep from you if Notre 
Dame beats the Seminoles, but suffers a killer letdown (see, Boston College, 
1993) against Air Force at home or USC on the road. Games of the century mean

 Don't laugh. A sellout is a given, as are the bitter feelings between UNLV 
Coach Jeff Horton and Nevada's Chris Ault. 
</P>
<P>
 Some background: When Ault became Nevada's athletic director after the 1992 
season, he hand-picked Horton to succeed him as coach. A year later, UNLV 
canned the unpopular Jim Strong and tried to hire Ault as the Rebels' coach. 
Ault said no, but Horton didn't. Not only that, Horton took six Nevada 
assistants to Las Vegas. A steamed Ault, who now serves as athletic director 
and coach, hasn't spoken with Horton since.

 Florida at Florida State 
</P>
<P>
 The Seminoles have won six of their last seven games against the Gators. In 
the last three games at Tallahassee--all victories--the Seminoles have scored 
52, 45 and 45 points against Steve Spurrier's team. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year in Gainesville, the Seminoles put up 33 points in a victory. Shortly 
thereafter, Bobby Pruett was hired as new defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Won't matter. Florida State will win again. WORST JOB SECURITY 
</P>
<P>
 1. Louisiana State's Curley Hallman. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Mike Archer wasn't such an awful coach after all. Since Hallman's 
arrival, the Tigers have gone 5-6, 2-9 and 5-6. Another sub-.500 season and 
Hallman will find himself doing color commentary on cable high school games. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Purdue's Jim Colletto. 
</P>
<P>
 Colletto puts on the happy face and refuses to talk about the past, which 
includes three consecutive losing seasons on his watch, six more before him. 
Also, the Boilermakers' 1-10 record last year was the worst at West Lafayette 
since 1942. Not even 16 returning starters will save Purdue from another 
dreadful season and Colletto from a pink slip. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Perles. 
</P>
<P>
 The university president is dropping ominous hints and the school's athletic 
director reportedly wanted Perles fired last February. Perles (68-56-4) needs 
to do better than 1993, when the Spartans finished 6-5 during the regular 
season and lost to Louisville in the Liberty Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Rutgers' Doug Graber. 
</P>
<P>
 Graber, a good guy who deserves better, can't afford another 4-7 season. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Ohio State's John Cooper. 
</P>
<P>
 Habit. BEST OFF-SEASON MOVES 
</P>
<P>
 1. Threatened with the possibility of a national playoff, the bowl alliance 
worked feverishly to improve its product. The result is a system, effective in 
the 1995 season and still imperfect, that unclogs Jan. 1 and puts four 
conference champions--the Atlantic Coast, the Big East, the Southeastern and 
the Big 12 (the Big Eight and four programs from the soon-to-be former 
Southwest) and two at-large teams in three bowl games: the Sugar, Fiesta and 
Orange. The new system also more than doubles the average payoffs of the three 
coalition bowls. 
</P>
<P>
 In a perfect bowl alliance, the two top-ranked teams in the nation would be 
coalition members and would meet in a de facto national championship game Jan. 
2. The sixth- and fourth-seeded teams would play Dec. 31, No. 3 vs. No. 5 on 
Jan. 1, and No. 1 vs. No. 2 would be alone on Jan. 2. And for those who cried 
foul about freezing out the independents, the coalition added a second at-large 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are kinks, of course. The Big Ten and Pac-10 champions are tied to 
the Rose Bowl until 2000, which means the coalition is sunk if, say, UCLA ends 
the regular season No. 1. Also, what happens if the Big East champion finishes 
the regular season ranked a so-so 10th? Like it or not, that team is in. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Alabama hiring Homer Smith as offensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Notre Dame sports information officials handing senior offensive tackle 
Mike McGlinn a questionnaire. The sarcastic McGlinn, when asked to complete the 
following sentence, "The national championship should be decided with a playoff 
because . . . " wrote, "As players, we feel the season is much too short." 
WORST OFF-SEASON MOVE 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to abolish the NCAA special committee formed to study the 
feasibility of a national playoff. BEST LOU HOLTZ LINES REMEMBERED BY NOTRE 
DAME PLAYERS 
</P>
<P>
 To wide receiver Derrick Mayes: "Son, are you happy now? You're responsible 
for me never wanting to recruit in Indianapolis again." 
</P>
<P>
 To a tubby offensive tackle, Ryan Leahy: "Is that a cast on your leg?" 
</P>
<P>
 To outside linebacker Jeremy Nau: "Son, you are stepping on my foot. Please 
remove your cleat." WORST TICKET SCAM 
</P>
<P>
 At the University of Cincinnati, where the football program hasn't been to a 
bowl game in more than 40 years, you can't buy basketball season tickets ($192 
last season) without also buying a football ticket package ($70). Beginning in 
1995, Bearcat basketball fans not only have to buy football season tickets, but 
also must pay $550 to join the athletic department's booster club. BEST CHANCES 
OF A BREAKTHROUGH SEASON 
</P>
<P>
 Kentucky--After four years of rebuilding and a 17-28 record to show for it, 
Bill Curry's Wildcats get a season to remember. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland--The Terrapins will record their first seven-victory season since 
1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern Methodist--In SMU's case, that means doubling last year's victory 
total, from two to four. 
</P>
<P>
 New Mexico--Remember the name: Coach Dennis Franchione. He won't be at New 
Mexico long. 
</P>
<P>
 Prairie View--The Panthers, holders of the longest current losing streak in 
college football, 35, haven't won since 1989. The streak ends Sept. 10 against 
Arkansas Pine Bluff or Tarleton State (who?) Nov. 5. BEST GUESS FOR 1994 TOP 
BOWLS 
</P>
<P>
 Rose--Wisconsin beats Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton--Clemson beats Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiesta--Florida State beats USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange--Miami beats Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 Sugar--Alabama beats Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 National champion--Auburn, the only undefeated team in the country, is voted 
No. 1 by AP voters. BEST 10 PLAYERS IN THE COUNTRY 03,20,16,06 No. Player 
School Pos. 1. Tyrone Wheatley Michigan RB 2. Derrick Brooks Florida State LB 
3. J.J. Stokes UCLA WR 4. Steve Stenstrom Stanford QB 5. Bobby Taylor Notre 
Dame FS 6. Korey Stringer Ohio State OT 7. Rob Johnson USC QB 8. Curtis Johnson 
North Carolina RB 9. Warren Sapp Miami DT 10. Brent Moss Wisconsin RB Honorable 
mention: Rutgers running back Terrell Willis. WORST REASON NOT TO HAVE A 
PLAYOFF 
</P>
<P>
 "The players will have to play too many games," the critics say of a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Is that so? Anyone glance at Fresno State's schedule this year? 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs play Ohio State in the Pigskin Classic, an extra game allowed by 
the NCAA. Then they play a 12-game regular-season schedule, one more than 
usual, thanks to an NCAA-approved trip to Hawaii. Then, Fresno can get a bowl 
bid. That comes to 14 games, the same number it would take for a team to play a 
regular-season schedule and win an eight-team national playoff.

 Michigan's Tyrone Wheatley, the All-American running back who some say defied 
logic by choosing a senior season over the NFL draft, almost certainly will sit 
out the Wolverines' season opener -- and possibly two more games -- after 
X-rays Wednesday revealed a second-degree separation of his right shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Wheatley suffered the injury during a Tuesday practice.His shoulder was put in 
a protective sling, where it will remain until a second set of X-rays are taken 
next week to determine if the injury is healing properly. 
</P>
<P>
 Barring any unexpected complications, Michigan team physicians are hopeful 
Wheatley would sit out no more than the team's Sept. 4 game against Boston 
College at Ann Arbor. At the very worst, said Michigan spokesman Bruce Madej, 
Wheatley also would sit out the Sept. 10 game at Notre Dame and possibly a 
Sept. 24 home game against Colorado. GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI

 USC tailback Shawn Walters takes his daily nap on the floor of Heritage Hall, 
where he sleeps on a red carpet between two Heisman Trophies. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Walters, who figures to start for the Trojans in their season-opener 
against Washington, dream of winning the Heisman? 
</P>
<P>
 "Every running back here dreams of that," Walters said. "But I'm just 
basically thinking about what's going on for the next practice." 
</P>
<P>
 Walters, who rushed for a team-high 711 yards and scored seven touchdowns last 
season, said he reported for practice in the best shape of his career. Walters, 
who played at 225 pounds last season, lost seven pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did a lot of running over the summer," he said. "I ran a lot of hills and I 
ran on the beach. The year before last I didn't really do anything during the 
summer, but this year I worked out a lot harder during the summer."

 Tailback Leonard Green, who had missed several days of practice with a 
hamstring injury, reinjured his right hamstring and was driven off the field on 
a golf cart. . . . USC, which has practiced twice a day since the start of 
camp, will practice only once today because players have to move out of the 
dorm where they've been housed. CHRIS BAKER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Unhappy with his team's conditioning and concerned about his running back 
situation, UCLA Coach Terry Donahue extended practice, employing different 
units in a scrimmage and working on play-calling. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the last practice of two-a-day drills. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back coach Wayne Moses was a lonesome assistant, with only five 
players to tutor: four freshmen and a sophomore from the scout team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nos. 1 and 2 tailbacks, Sharmon Shah and Derek Ayers, watched from the 
sideline, along with the Nos. 1 and 2 fullbacks, James Milliner and Daron 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaun Williams, who ran a few plays, has a groin pull. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullback Jevone Moore, a sophomore walk-on, was the most experienced of Moses' 
charges. Freshmen Jarvis Watson, Akil Davis and Greg Ford were the others. 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue said he expects Milliner and Washington to be back, but he's concerned 
about Shah, whose knee is not responding to treatment, and Ayers, whose injury 
is worse than first thought. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Bruins had to play Tennessee this Saturday, Donahue said, the tailback 
rotation would be Washington and Williams, with Milliner and Ford at fullback. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's scheduled scrimmage will probably have to be modified because of a 
lack of available running backs, and there is concern that anything but a full 
contact workout could be detrimental to everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your defense needs tackling under game conditions," said Donahue, who added 
that he could not remember sending a team into a season-opening game without at 
least one full scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>

 Scott Fitterer, who never threw a pass as a fourth-string quarterback, has 
transferred to Louisiana State, where he will play football and baseball. 
Fitterer pitched long relief for the Bruins and reportedly has a 90-m.p.h. 
fastball. JIM HODGES

 The NCAA sued the Florida Board of Regents, seeking to void a state law that 
has prevented it from acting on the eligibility of several Florida State 
players who took part in an illegal shopping spree. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA wants to overturn a 1992 law that has kept it from actively 
investigating possible rules violations at Florida State and also at the 
University of Miami, said NCAA enforcement executive David Berst. 
</P>
<P>
 All-American linebacker Derrick Brooks and tailback Tiger McMillon were 
suspended by Florida State for two games and guard Patrick McNeil for three 
games for accepting gifts last November from prospective agents in violation of 
NCAA rules. A fourth player, Forrest Conoly, was suspended indefinitely by 
university president Talbot D'Alemberte.

RAMS STILL LOOKING FOR ANY GOOD NEWS; PRO FOOTBALL: THE MAIN OBJECTIVE IN 
TONIGHT'S FINAL EXHIBITION AGAINST THE CHARGERS IS TO AVOID INJURIES, BUT THEY 
ALSO WANT A VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Defensive tackle D'Marco Farr figures tonight's exhibition game between his 
0-3 Rams and the 0-4 San Diego Chargers will have all the action and suspense 
of one of those pro wrestling matches he loves to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be like one of those tag-team matches," said Farr, a rookie 
free agent from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never know, somebody could come out of the dressing room and pound the 
guys on the head with a megaphone and decide it that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps that might be a fitting end to the Rams' exhibition season tonight at 
Jack Murphy Stadium. And while it's not exactly part of Coach Chuck Knox's game 
plan, the Rams are looking for all the help they can find in trying to win 
their first exhibition game since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams will try to end their eight-game exhibition losing streak with an 
offensive line that's struggling to protect its quarterback, a beat-up 
defensive line and a secondary that's being picked apart by quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 But what the Rams don't want is a repeat of last week's injuries in a 29-20 
loss to the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 In a span of about 60 seconds late in the second quarter, quarterback Chris 
Miller was headed to the locker room with a cut on his chin after being hit, 
and Pro Bowl defensive tackle Sean Gilbert was clutching his sprained left 
ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive end Gerald Robinson (left ankle) and defensive tackle Jimmie Jones 
(sore wrist) were already getting X-rays. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller and Jones are starting tonight, but Farr is expected to replace 
Gilbert, and rookie Brad Ottis, a second-round draft pick, is slated to start 
in place of Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox expects to hold out some of his starters but did not indicate which ones. 
He said he plans to give plenty of playing time to backups such as offensive 
linemen Chuck Belin and Keith Loneker and running backs James Bostic and Howard 
Griffith. Seven players must be cut by Sunday, when rosters are to be trimmed 
to 53 players for the Sept. 4 regular-season opener against Arizona.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's a sense of urgency there right now," Miller said. "We need to be 
sharp, we need to be crisp and we need to be ready for the season-opener. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just need to clean things up a little bit. We're game-planning a little 
more for the Chargers, and we didn't do that a lot for the Raiders." 
</P>
<P>
 With home attendance dwindling and the players wondering if the team is moving 
to Baltimore or St. Louis, can the Rams find a winning combination? 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback Jerome Bettis thinks so. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's 36 left, 36 right, 36 left," Bettis said, calling out his jersey number. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just need to get in sync, like a lock. Just click, then we'll open. But 
right now, we're still turning. But once we get that number, we'll open right 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis, who gained 1,429 yards as a rookie last season, is still waiting for 
those holes to open. Playing only two quarters in exhibition losses to New 
England and the Raiders, he has gained only 57 yards in 20 carries, a 2.9-yard 
average. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big picture right now, obviously, is Arizona," Bettis said. "The San 
Diego game will give us another good look at the core, to see how we'll mesh in 
a game situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just not consistent on offense. We know exactly what the offensive 
line, running backs, quarterbacks and receivers are going to give us now. And 
the coaches know how to work with that." 
</P>
<P>
 After some ineffective experimentation in the first two games, the Rams appear 
to be set with a starting offensive line of tackles Jackie Slater and Clarence 
Jones, guards Leo Goeas and Bill Schultz, and center Bern Brostek. 
</P>
<P>
 The first-string defense has given up 34 points playing only half of the past 
two games, and the Raiders had 206 yards of offense by halftime last week. 
</P>
<P>
 And with the first-string defensive line producing only one sack in the past 
two games, teams have consistently passed on the Rams' starting cornerbacks, 
Todd Lyght and Steve Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyght got beat for a touchdown against Green Bay and for two against New 
England, and he struggled covering the Raiders' Daryl Hobbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel, who's battling a sore thigh muscle, was beaten for a 25-yard touchdown 
catch by Raider tight end Andrew Glover and was called for pass interference 
and facemask penalties that set up another score. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Rams did get some good news about their secondary Tuesday, when a 
federal judge granted cornerback Darryl Henley permission to travel with the 
team this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley, under indictment on drug charges, sought a change in his bail 
restrictions that allowed him to play in road games. He is expected to sit out 
tonight's game with a hamstring pull he suffered in practice. 
</P>
<P>
 So with an injury-plagued defense and the possibility of another winless 
exhibition season, can the Rams expect to do any better than last year's 5-11 
record? 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a cloud hanging over us right now because this is only the 
exhibition season," Bettis said. "But there will be a cloud hanging over us if 
we're 0-5 in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't get down just because we haven't won a preseason game. That won't 
determine whether we're a good football team or not."

MOTOR RACING; IF FERRARIS ARE YOUR SPEED, TRY MONTEREY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Monterey Peninsula and Modena, Italy, might be oceans apart, but they will 
have something very much in common this weekend -- Ferraris. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrari, celebrating its 45th anniversary in Modena, will be the featured car 
in the Monterey historic auto races Friday through Sunday at Laguna Seca 
Raceway. More than 1,000 Ferrari owners will have their cars at the event, and 
more than 80 vehicles carrying the prancing horse logo will race. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, 335 vintage race cars will compete in 14 races over the 2.2-mile, 
11-turn course. Represented besides Ferrari will be Porsche, Maserati, Bugatti, 
Lotus, Shelby, Mercedes-Benz, Jaguar, Ford, Chevrolet and others. 
</P>
<P>
 It is customary at Monterey for the owners to drive their cars, and among them 
will be Phil Hill, the first American Formula One champion. Hill, who won the 
title in 1952, will drive his 212 Ferrari. Austrian Niki Lauda, another former 
grand prix champion, will demonstrate the 312 Ferrari F1 car in which he won 
the 1977 championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Luigi Chinetti, former Ferrari driver and team owner, will be a guest at the 
races. Chinetti, now 93, gave Ferrari its first victory in the LeMans 24-hour 
race, driving a 166 MM for 23 hours in 1949. He later became the North American 
importer of Ferraris, established the North American Racing Team, and aided the 
driving careers of Hill, Richie Ginther, Dan Gurney and the Rodriguez brothers, 
Pedro and Ricardo. As a team owner, he gave Ferrari the last of its nine Le 
Mans victories in '65. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferrari representatives will include Piero Ferrari, son of founder Enzo 
Ferrari and a company vice president; Luca Cordero di Montezemolo, president 
and CEO and former head of the F1 program; Gian Luigi Buitoni, president of 
Ferrari North America, and Sergio Pininfarina, whose company has been 
responsible for many Ferrari designs. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other historically significant cars that will race or be displayed over 
the weekend: 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1961 Ferrari 250 Testa Rossa, driven to victory by Hill in the '61 LeMans 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1965 Ferrari 250 LM, the last Ferrari to have won at LeMans. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1971 Ferrari 512 M, driven by the late Mark Donohue for Roger Penske. 
</P>
<P>
 -- 1976 Ferrari 312 T2, driven by Lauda during the '76 Formula One season. 
</P>
<P>
 In conjunction with the vintage racing, an auction of vintage sports and 
classic cars will be held Friday and Saturday at the Monterey Conference 
Center. Among the 170 cars to be auctioned is the 1953 Stroppe Kurtis 500 S 
midget built by Bill Stroppe and Frank Kurtis. 
</P>

 Ron Hornaday of Palmdale won the Winston 200 at Cajon Speedway last Saturday, 
leading 189 of the 200 laps. Hornaday's second victory of the season put him 45 
points behind Mike Chase of Bakersfield in the NASCAR Winston West driver 
standings. The next event is Sept. 3 at Tri-City Raceway in West Richland, 
Wash. Motorsports Notes

<P>
 POWERBOATS -- Hot boats and water skiers will race Sunday in the 63rd annual 
Long Beach Sea Festival at Long Beach Marine Stadium. Fastest of the boats are 
the Formula One craft, which hit speeds of 140 m.p.h. and can accelerate to 100 
m.p.h. in five seconds. Former world champion John Castelli of Yorba Linda and 
former national champion Jimmy Johnson of Cypress both are entered. 
</P>
<P>

DEL MAR; LUKAS WANTS TWO-TURN RACES FOR IMPRESSIVE TIMBER COUNTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A trainer with a vision for the future can grow a little frustrated watching 
his 2-year-olds swallow a steady diet of sprint-length stakes races. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those trainers is Wayne Lukas, whose Timber Country ate up the field in 
the stretch to win the Balboa Stakes on Wednesday. It was Grade III race worth 
$75,000, run at a mere 6 1/2 furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
 "You pay half a million for a horse, and you want him to run around two 
turns," Lukas said. "I'm not crazy about running him in sprints." 
</P>
<P>
 The Del Mar Futurity, the closing day feature here, is now run around one 
turn, or seven furlongs, instead of its previous one-mile format with two 
turns. 
</P>
<P>
 "That used to be a beautiful race," Lukas said. "I'd like to see them take 
this back to seven-eighths and that one back to a mile." 
</P>
<P>
 Two-year-olds just don't get a chance to stretch their legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Timber Country, for one, figures to improve with added distance. He came from 
behind to win a maiden race at 6 1/2 furlongs here Aug. 6 and the main question 
Wednesday was whether he had enough room to rally against better horses at the 
same distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Favored Desert Pirate, the winner of the Graduation Stakes on Aug. 3, set an 
early pace with Cold N Calculating and Supremo right behind him. Jockey Alex 
Solis had Timber Country off the pace, where he figures to thrive.  
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like he was going to close," Lukas said. "I just told Alex to settle 
in." 
</P>
<P>
 When Solis called upon him, Timber Country had plenty to rally through the 
middle of the track and defeat Desert Mirage and Supremo at the wire. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't have the speed to go with these kinds of horses early," Solis 
said, "but he's got that late run. He feels like he can run all day." 
</P>
<P>
 Corey Nakatani, Desert Mirage's jockey, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a great late run," Nakatani said. "Wait until they go long. He'll be 
laying three or four lengths off them and he'll blow them down late." 
</P>
<P>
 Lukas thinks so highly of Timber Country that he made the trip from Saratoga 
to watch him run. 
</P>
<P>
 "This horse has a magnificent pedigree," Lukas said. "His mare (Fall Aspen) is 
really something, one of the top mares. She's had winners on both continents, 
different distances, dirt, grass. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Timber Country would appear to be Lukas' next big guy in more than running 
ability. 
</P>
<P>
 "This horse stood six to eight inches taller than any other horse in this 
race," the trainer said. "He's a big horse with a long stride. He has to gather 
it together so he can't get into the early fractions. He's got a big future." 
</P>
<P>
 However, that big future will be at longer distances. Significantly, the big 
races down the road as a 2-year-old turns 3 are all around two turns. There are 
no sprints when it comes to the Triple Crown. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was going to pick a 3-year-old," Lukas said, "this is the kind of horse 
I'd start with." 
</P>
<P>
 Next stop: The Del Mar Futurity, Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Corey Nakatani is Del Mar's leading jockey after 25 days of the 43-day 
meeting, and his chances of winning the title are not hurt by Alex Solis' 
pending suspension and the fact that many Del Mar jockeys are in Chicago this 
weekend for Arlington's International Festival of Racing. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakatani had 27 victories after Wednesday, two ahead of Gary Stevens. Kent 
Desormeaux, winner here for the last two years, is third with 22 victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens and Desormeaux will both be at Arlington for at least part of the 
weekend. Nakatani, in fact, gets Magical Maiden, normally a Stevens horse, in 
the chase against Paseana and Exchange in Sunday's Chula Vista Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens will be in Chicago on Saturday and Sunday, riding Hero's Love in the 
Beverly D and Fastness in the Arlington Million. Desormeaux gets Fanmore in the 
Million and Indian Sun in the Secretariat at Arlington after riding Skiable for 
Bobby Frankel in the Osunitas Stakes here Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Solis, the riding champion at Hollywood Park, was to begin a five-day 
suspension here today, but he remains active pending the result of an appeal. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Phone Chatter, the winner of the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies last year, 
will make her first start of the year this afternoon as the 6-5 morning line 
favorite in the $55,000 CERF Stakes over 6 1/2 furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of four of six starts as a 2-year-old, Phone Chatter broke a cannon 
bone in her left rear leg in her Breeders' Cup victory. She has been out since, 
recuperating from surgery that required three screws to repair the fracture. 
Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The stewards worked overtime Wednesday, with inquiries after the third, fourth 
and sixth races. Gift to the World was taken down as the winner of the second 
race, Properly Married moving up and Gift to the World placed second. Elaine's 
Love was placed third after winning the sixth race, I'm Confused getting the 
victory. . . . Trainer Rodney Rash, already in Chicago for the Arlington 
weekend, said he would not run Aube Indienne in Saturday's Osunitas here. 
However, trainer David Hofmans said Angi Go was a go for the Saturday feature.

EL TORO JETS MAKE FLY-DOWN TO NEW HOME; MILITARY: CEREMONY IN SAN DIEGO GREETS 
24 FA-18 HORNETS. FLIGHTS SIGNAL THE BEGINNING OF THE END FOR SOUTH COUNTY 
MARINE BASE AND REPRESENT FIRST OF HUNDREDS OF AIRCRAFT TO BE SENT TO MIRAMAR 
BY 1999. 
</P>

<P>
 In a ceremony that appears to signal the beginning of the end for the El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station, 24 Marine jets touched down Wednesday at their new 
home at the Miramar Naval Air Station in San Diego, welcomed in a traditional 
Navy piping-aboard rite. 
</P>
<P>
 The FA-18 Hornets passed in a ceremonial fly-by at 2:55 p.m., in view of a 
small crowd of dignitaries invited to witness the Marines' arrival. Under a 
blue, cloudless sky, breaking to the left one at a time before doing a lazy 
half-circle and setting down on the runway, the steel-gray aircraft flew in 
formation in groups of four. 
</P>
<P>
 After each plane had landed, they lined up single file and taxied to a stop in 
front of the dignitaries, which included Navy and Marine flag officers and 
local politicians who sat under a blue- and white-striped awning. 
</P>
<P>
 The contingent of FA-18 attack aircraft represents the first of several 
hundred jets and helicopters that will be transferred from El Toro to Miramar 
by 1999, when the Marine base is scheduled to close and the Marines will assume 
control of the San Diego base from the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 The transfer has all but dashed the hopes of those in Orange County who were 
counting on a last-minute reprieve from the Pentagon to keep El Toro open. 
</P>
<P>
 For two years, private citizens and politicians alike have been lobbying the 
Pentagon, citing studies and reports suggesting that it would be more expensive 
to close El Toro than to keep it open. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wednesday's event indicated that the Pentagon has not been swayed by the 
pleas from El Toro supporters. The pilots who landed the Hornets Wednesday will 
be followed by 410 active-duty Marines and 470 reservists whose jobs will be 
transferred to San Diego in the next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, Wednesday's pomp proved that one community's loss is 
another's gain. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't tell you how pleased we are that you were able to send in the 
Marines," said San Diego City Councilwoman Judy McCarty, in a reference to an 
effort by local developer Doug Manchester, who wants to turn Miramar into a 
commercial airport if the military ever leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 McCarty, who opposes a commercial airport at Miramar, said the arrival of the 
Marines assures that the base will remain a military airport well into the next 
century, after the Navy moves its planes to bases in Northern California and 
Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marines, too, saw the significance of Wednesday's event. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day at El Toro, an Orange County landmark and strategic 
military airport since World War II, Marine Maj. Charlie Walsh climbed aboard 
his FA-18 and took his symbolic place in Orange County and Marine Corps lore. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a piece of American history coming to an end," said Walsh, 42. A 
16-year Marine Corps veteran stationed at El Toro the past three years, Walsh 
is the executive officer of VMFA-121, the "Green Knights."  
</P>
<P>
 "An awful lot of world events have been supported from this place -- World War 
II, Vietnam, the pilots from El Toro played a major role in Desert Storm and 
the Gulf War," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Walsh said, "We are really just moving to another base. For 
a Marine, that's nothing new." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Pentagon in 1993 announced plans to close El Toro and move the 
Marines to Miramar, a dispute quickly arose between the two branches of 
service. Senior Marine and Navy officers squabbled over who was going to use 
certain facilities once the Marines arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, both sides sought to put the disputes behind them and toast a 
spirit of cooperation for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Vice Adm. Robert J. Spane, commander of all Naval air forces in the Pacific, 
welcomed Marine Maj. Gen. P. Drax Williams, commander of the El Toro base and 
all Marine Corps air bases in the West. "Welcome aboard, and let's get on" with 
the mission, Spane said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the departure of the squadron from El Toro was not open to the 
public, a handful of spectators were on hand, including LaVerne Bruce of south 
Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad," Bruce said as the planes departed. "For those of us who love 
aviation, it's a loss. I think it's symbolic. Many people in this area have 
devoted their lives to aviation." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the situation at Miramar, the future of the El Toro base is less 
certain. A group of Orange County businessmen led by developer George Argyros 
succeeded in placing a binding measure on the November ballot, which, if passed 
by voters, would require the county to build a commercial airport at El Toro 
when the Marines leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the measure, which include leaders of most South County cities 
with close ties to the Marine base, have promised a court battle to kill the 
initiative.

LAS VEGAS MURDER VICTIM HAD FLED TO AVOID SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN ELLINGWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 20-year-old Las Vegas woman murdered in May had fled to get away from one of 
two Fullerton College football players arrested this week in connection with 
the slaying, investigators and family members said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Arraignment is scheduled today in Orange County Superior Court for the two 
suspects, Anthony Steven James, 20, and Malcolm Lathion Gray, 19, both of 
Corona. They were arrested on campus during football practice Tuesday 
afternoon. If they do not waive extradition on the murder charges in Nevada, 
authorities there will begin formal extradition proceedings to try them in Las 
Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Vegas authorities charge that James fatally shot his ex-girlfriend, 
20-year-old Amy Tuttle, formerly of Riverside, on May 27 after he and Gray 
spent the day arguing with her in Tuttle's Las Vegas apartment. Police believe 
Gray was in the room and tried to help cover up the shooting, investigators 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months before the slaying, Tuttle, a 1993 graduate of Centennial High 
School in Corona who had won awards for her poetry, ended a two-year 
relationship with James, according to police and her family members. She moved 
to Las Vegas in February to put some distance between them, taking jobs as a 
swimming pool attendant at Caesars Palace and trainer at a Gold's Gym, said her 
father, Timothy Tuttle, a history teacher at Centennial High. 
</P>
<P>
 James and Gray, high school classmates of Tuttle, had visited her in Las Vegas 
about a month before the shooting and fought so loudly that neighbors summoned 
the apartment building's security, said Detective Dave Hatch of the Las Vegas 
Metropolitan Police. 
</P>
<P>
 The day before the shooting, neighbors reported hearing arguing, the sound of 
crashing objects and then gunfire about 1:20 a.m., police said.  
</P>
<P>
 James and Gray said they found Tuttle shot in the head after returning from a 
convenience store and spotted a man running from the building, police said. It 
was James and Gray who carried her downstairs and called for medical help. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Hatch said a neighbor contends he witnessed the shooting from a window but 
fled the scene because of outstanding arrest warrants against him. The man is 
now in custody and cooperating with police, Hatch said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a senseless thing. They just got to arguing," Hatch said. Neither James 
nor Gray had a criminal record, Hatch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton detectives arrested James and Gray -- still in their football 
equipment -- in a team training room during practice after they were told to 
report for blood-pressure checks. Both had joined the team as "walk-on" 
players, James as a running back and Gray a linebacker; they had not played in 
any games. 
</P>
<P>
 Both had enrolled Monday as new students in a two-year vocational program; 
James planned to study automotive service and Gray had chosen accounting, 
college spokesman Al Busch said. 
</P>
<P>
 The young woman's father, Timothy Tuttle, expressed relief that an arrest had 
been made. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm extremely happy they're not out there where they can harm anyone else," 
he said. "I've been living in some fear and concern that they might harm 
somebody else in my family." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton spokesman Busch said the arrests, performed discreetly in the late 
afternoon on the second day of school, attracted little attention on the 
college campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody really realized what's happened yet," he said.

NO-COST HEALTH CARE; NEWPORT-MESA DISTRICT PROVIDES FREE VACCINES, SCREENINGS 
TO STUDENTS 
</P>

<P>
 Haydee Bonales worries about her children's health care. With her family's 
tight budget and no health insurance, the 34-year-old mother said, she can 
barely afford groceries ,let alone doctor visits for her three children. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So when Bonales' 12-year-old daughter, Janet, needed polio, TB and tetanus 
shots to enroll at TeWinkle Middle School this fall, the family turned to their 
school district for help. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Janet joined the hundreds of other children who have gotten free 
shots and medical tests during the past week at a new clinic sponsored by the 
Newport-Mesa Unified School District and PacifiCare Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said the cooperative effort is part of a new push to get 
schools involved in providing more extensive preventive health care to children 
from low-income families. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many people think that there is no need for this kind of program in Newport 
Beach," said Lucy Cunningham, president of the PacifiCare Foundation, the 
charitable arm of PacifiCare of California. "But with very few Medi-Cal 
providers and a large uninsured immigrant population present, access to basic 
health care services is a serious issue for these families." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the clinic at the Rea Community Center opened Aug. 15, district schools 
have referred students from Newport Beach and Costa Mesa to the facility, where 
they can be immunized from measles, polio, tuberculosis and other diseases. The 
youngsters also receive physical examinations and hearing, vision and reading 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other school districts in California, the Newport-Mesa district receives 
funding through the state's Healthy Start program to spend on preventive health 
care, nutrition or other programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The state gave the Newport-Mesa district $400,000 over three years to run the 
clinic. To supplement the grant, PacifiCare contributed $70,000 and the Bristol 
Medical Group contributed medical supplies, organizers said. 
</P>
<P>
 For families like the Bonaleses, who get by on less than $1,500 each month, 
the clinic opened just in time for school. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Bonales sat in the waiting room with her 12-year-old daughter, 
6-year-old son and 8-month-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bonaleses moved to Orange County from Mexico six years ago. While they 
wait to become citizens, only their baby, who was born here, is insured by 
Medi-Cal. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, her son, Fernando, received his shots at a private clinic, which 
cost the family "a lot" of money, their mother said. It was a necessary burden, 
she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I lived in Mexico, I would take my children to get a physical every six 
months," Bonales said, balancing her baby daughter on her hip. "Here, I can't 
do it. I can't afford it." 
</P>
<P>
 Doris Chekouras, the clinic's only nurse, said most of her patients speak 
little English. "We always seem to manage no matter what language they speak," 
Chekouras said while giving a 9-year-old girl a TB shot Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Children are referred to the clinic from their school, based on an individual 
family's needs. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic will be open throughout the school year and is at the Rea Community 
Center at 661 Hamilton St. Hours are from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. for health 
screenings and from 3 to 7 p.m. for immunizations. Appointments are required. 
Parents can contact their children's schools for information.

POLICE FILE CLAIMS OVER HUNTINGTON'S REFUSAL TO PAY STATE FOR SPIKING; 
PENSIONS: OFFICERS SAY THE CITY IS JEOPARDIZING ITS CONTRACT WITH THE 
RETIREMENT SYSTEM, ENDANGERING THEIR BENEFITS. DEPUTY CITY ATTORNEY SAYS MOVE 
IS PREMATURE AND SHOULD WAIT UNTIL PERS ISSUE IS RESOLVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police officers have filed 99 claims against the city, charging that their 
retirement benefits are in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach Police Officers' Assn. President Richard Wright said 
Wednesday the claims are intended to protect employees if the city loses its 
contract with the state Public Employees' Retirement System over a dispute 
about paying a bill for pension costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to protect the employees from any loss in benefits that could arise 
by any bad faith bargaining between the city and PERS," Wright said. "Our best 
legal advice is that this is the best course to pursue." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright said he expects more police officers and other city employees to file 
similar claims. The claims charge that individual damages would exceed $25,000 
and may be as high as $1 million if pension benefits are lost as a result of 
the city's actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Gregory G. Petersen, representing the police officers' association, 
said the city has refused to pay the PERS bill, violating its contract with 
employee unions and possibly affecting their pension benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "By not paying it they put in danger the basic manner in which the officers' 
pensions would be paid in the future," Petersen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Petersen also said the claims are the first step before a lawsuit is filed 
against the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, Deputy City Atty. Bob Sangster said that the claims are 
premature. "No one has been harmed and these issues should wait until after the 
city and PERS have resolved their issues," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 PERS wants the city to pay $919,000 as the city's contribution toward the 
retirement for 39 employees who converted certain benefits, such as pay for 
unused vacation and sick leave, to their final year's salary, on which a 
pension is based. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, the City Council voted not to pay the sum. 
</P>
<P>
 Some council members contend that the practice of city employees "inflating" 
their pensions to increase their retirement pay is illegal and should not have 
been allowed by PERS, and therefore the city should not be obligated to pay the 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say that if the city must contribute to such pensions for city 
workers, ultimately, it could cost $13 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The city agreed in past contracts with employee unions that certain benefits 
could be converted to salary. However, a new state law has made most aspects of 
converting benefits illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 PERS informed the city in a July 22 letter that it is obligated to pay for the 
pension costs and that it will increase the city's contribution rate to cover 
the sum.  
</P>
<P>
 The letter also stated that failure by the city to pay the bill could result 
in termination of the city's contract with PERS. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, city officials meet with PERS officials to discuss the dispute and 
the council has since met in closed session to discuss its options. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy City Administrator Richard Barnard said that the city intends to honor 
its obligations with PERS. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are paying and meeting contractual obligations with PERS," Barnard said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; CITY ASKS THAT SIGN AT BEACH BE REMOVED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sign read "Surf With Caution." It warned of polluted waters near the mouth 
of the San Gabriel River. But after numerous calls from concerned beach-goers, 
city staffers hit upon a solution: Take down the sign. 
</P>
<P>
 The sign was posted last Memorial Day near the popular Seal Beach surfing spot 
by the Surfrider Foundation, an environmental group based in San Clemente with 
chapters nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "A city staffer said too many moms were calling and complaining," said Gordon 
Labedz, a Seal Beach physician who spoke to council members on behalf of the 
Surfrider Foundation on Monday night. "He said, 'Do you mind if we take the 
sign down?' 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't mind if the city takes down our sign. We just want the city to put 
up their own sign." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the popular surfing spot has no warning sign. 
</P>
<P>
 The Surfrider Foundation has tested the water at the 1st Street surfing site 
and Labedz says adult surfers there routinely complain of noxious odors, 
especially during low tide. 
</P>
<P>
 "The water stinks. We test about once a week and we find it frequently 
polluted," Labedz said. "There's a lot of data on the river. I don't think 
anybody disputes that the water is frequently polluted." 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Health Care Agency also tests water quality at six Seal 
Beach locations each week. The agency routinely issues news releases warning of 
pollution near the San Gabriel River mouth after rainstorms, when debris from a 
large section of Orange and Los Angeles counties washes into the river. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bacteria levels do increase as the urban runoff comes down," said Larry 
Honeybourne, water quality program chief for the Environmental Health division 
of the Health Care Agency. "Generally, the levels are acceptable and meet state 
water quality standards." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say they sympathize with the concerns of the Surfrider 
Foundation, but insist that it's up to the county to post warning signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county had warned us that in order to put up signs, we have to have 
certain tests we conduct regularly," said Seal Beach Mayor George Brown. "We're 
not able to do that at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 County health officials say they are considering posting health warning signs 
on all county beaches where storm drains dump into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles County, Labedz says most beaches post warning signs near storm 
drain runoff areas. But regardless of who puts up the sign, he believes the 
public should be warned year-round of potential health hazards in some Seal 
Beach waters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public has a right to know that water here is often polluted," Labedz 
said. "Most of the adult surfers who go in the water know the water is polluted 
and they're willing to take their chances. We're concerned about the young kids 
who surf in that water who are unaware that it is frequently polluted." RUSS

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; STUDENTS GET HARD LESSON ON GANG LIFE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a crowd of youngsters was held rapt, former gang member Jesse Soto, 36, 
described the pain and suffering gangs inflict not only on their communities 
but on their own members. 
</P>
<P>
 While he spoke, pictures depicting corpses of young people flashed on a 
projection screen behind him, underscoring his point that "you're never too 
young to get shot at." 
</P>
<P>
 Soto's appearance Wednesday was part of a program designed to steer elementary 
school students away from gangs and drugs. During the two-day Peer Assistance 
Leadership programs, more than 600 children received that message, district 
spokeswoman Diane Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program also included lectures on bike safety, games and a puppet show by 
Drug Abuse Resistance Education Officer John Reed. 
</P>
<P>
 During his lecture, Soto told children gangs promise respect, friendship and 
security but deliver the opposite. 
</P>
<P>
 He discouraged them from wearing gang-related clothing and hanging out with 
gang members because "kids lose their lives today just because of the way 
they're dressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Following his presentation, Soto said showing children photos of people killed 
by gangs and gang members beaten during initiation rites is crucial for them to 
understand the truth about gang life. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea they get from TV about gangs is people with lots of money and big 
cars. They kill, shoot people, and their friends are happy and smiling about 
it. I don't want them to see that," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want them to see the reality. I want them to see mothers crying," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, several students said they appreciated the program and took the 
message to heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's really important because we're at the age where (gang members) 
come and bother us," said Celia Galindo, 13.JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; DRUG-ABUSE POLICY UPDATED BY COUNCIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials will be required to report the names of city employees who have 
been convicted of drunk driving and drug offenses to the federal government 
under an updated substance abuse policy approved by the City Council this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The council adopted the policy Monday to toughen an 8-year-old city regulation 
that also requires employees suspected of drug abuse to submit to mandatory 
drug testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant City Manager Gerard Goedhart said that federal law now requires 
cities to report employee drug convictions in order to remain eligible for 
grants from federal agencies such as the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development and the Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 The reporting requirement is part of the federal Drug-Free Workplace Act of 
1988, which mandates the development of drug and alcohol policies by local 
agencies receiving federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the federal reporting requirement, the city updated its policy 
on mandatory drug testing to include more details on how the tests are 
conducted and who conducts the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, the policy is substantially the same as the one adopted in 1986, 
Goedhart said. In eight years, he added, no employee has been ordered to take 
tests or dismissed from a job because of drug violations. 
</P>
<P>
 All new hired workers must take drug tests as part of their physical 
examinations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The updated drug-testing policy has been approved by the city's various 
employee groups and will take effect immediately. It will apply to full- and 
part-time employees, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug tests will include breath, urine and blood analyses to check for use 
of illegal drugs -- such as cocaine and marijuana -- or alcohol. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees face possible dismissal after testing positive for drug and alcohol 
use. First-time offenders could keep their jobs despite proven use of alcohol, 
marijuana, amphetamines or barbiturates if they enter a drug-abuse or 
alcohol-treatment program. A second offense could lead to dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 But those who tested positive for cocaine, heroin, methadone or other more 
serious drugs could be dismissed on a first offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The city manager may call the police to search an employee's desk or locker, 
but only with the consent of the employee and only if a representative of the 
union to which the employee belongs is present. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the policy, an employee involved in a fatal accident, or one who was 
using a city vehicle during any accident, must submit to a drug and alcohol 
test, Goedhart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Drug and alcohol tests are confidential and will be kept in files separate 
from regular employee folders. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the test results may be used during court hearings, labor disputes 
between the city and the employee, for diagnosis and treatment and if the 
employee consents to release the information.BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; 2 INJURED IN LEAP FROM CONDO FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two men were injured Wednesday morning when they leaped from a second-floor 
window to escape a fire that destroyed their Huntington Beach condominium. 
</P>
<P>
 Walter Vandenabbeele, 36, broke his leg when he landed on a portable barbecue 
grill, said Martha Werth, spokeswoman for the Huntington Beach Fire 
Department.He was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange. His roommate, Robert 
Blind, 39, received minor injuries that were treated at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Blind awakened in the second-floor bedroom of the condominium in the 700 block 
of Pacific Coast Highway about 5:40 a.m. and discovered the fire downstairs, 
Werth said. Blind awakened Vandenabbeele and, with no other way out, the two 
jumped 15 feet from a bedroom window, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators were looking into the cause of the fire, which appeared to have 
started in the living room on the first floor, Werth said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the condominium had no smoke detector and only one door out, on the 
first floor. 
</P>
<P>
 These guys are really lucky they weren't fatalities," Werth said. "With a 
smoke detector . . . they would have had plenty of time to get out of there 
safely." KEN ELLINGWOOD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; COLLEGE DISTRICT CRIME RATE DROPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vandalism, graffiti and thefts on campuses throughout the Rancho Santiago 
Community College District plummeted 50% over the last year, security officials 
announced this week. 
</P>
<P>
 But in his report to district trustees, security director J.R. Johnson called 
for additional safety measures to further reduce crime on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said that for the 1993-94 academic year, no burglaries or assaults 
were reported on district grounds. In the previous year, the district recorded 
10 burglaries and three robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 Thefts from vehicles also declined from 68 the previous year to 58, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson credited the board's 1992 decision to spend $250,000 on security 
improvements for the drop in crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The board authorized spending the money on gates to close parking lots at 
night, and special observation towers for security personnel to oversee parking 
lots. Other enhancements included adding 24-hour security at some campuses in 
the college district. 
</P>
<P>
 He also cited the presence of student security assistants who patrolled 
campuses during the summer. Throughout the course of that three-month program, 
no cars were broken into or stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he noted that some crime categories remained essentially unchanged. 
For the 1993-94 year, the district reported one rape, three robberies and 17 
car thefts. Statistics for the the previous year are nearly identical. JON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; FATAL SHOOTING CASE UNDER INVESTIGATION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Costa Mesa police detectives Wednesday searched a house in the 800 block of 
Victoria Street, where a 30-year-old woman was found shot to death earlier in 
the week.  
</P>
<P>
 Police Capt. Tom Lazar identified the woman as Roxanne Michelle Martin, 30, of 
Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "The case is wide open at this point," Lazar said. "We have no suspects, but 
we're not ruling anybody out. Anybody could be a suspect." 
</P>
<P>
 Police would not say whether Martin lived there, nor how she knew the owner, 
Anthony J. Kubis Jr., 37. Nor would they say whether Kubis lives at the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin's body was found Monday, shot several times. 
</P>
<P>
 Police requested a search warrant early Tuesday morning when they could not 
get permission from Kubis to search the house, Lazar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors who live in the area told police they heard gunshots Monday night 
but didn't take it seriously enough to call police, police spokesman George 
Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 One neighbor said she was still afraid because no one has been arrested in the 
slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time anything like this has happened, and I've lived here 
for 19 years," said Marisa Quintana, 19, who lives a block away.TOM RAGAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: DANA POINT; TIME-SHARE RESORT MORATORIUM VOTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week declared a 45-day moratorium on the construction of 
time-share resorts, an action that some business owners said could derail 
resorts now planned for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 1 to establish the moratorium to allow city officials 
time to study the impacts of the controversial resorts. Mayor Judy Curreri cast 
the dissenting vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Karen Lloreda, long an outspoken foe of time shares, said the 
city needs 45 days to study a variety of issues including the collection of bed 
taxes, traffic, building standards and the conversion of existing hotels, 
motels and apartment units into time shares. She said the current proliferation 
of potential time-share projects necessitated immediate council action. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a ban on time shares in Dana Point," said Lloreda, who lives in 
the Capistrano Beach neighborhood where the two existing time shares are 
located. "This just gives us an opportunity to study the various issues." 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Jerry Patterson said a report on a proposed ordinance regulating 
time shares would be presented to the council at least 10 days before the 
moratorium expires. At that time the council could conduct a public hearing and 
either adopt the ordinance or extend the moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Because time shares create traffic and parking problems but do not generate 
bed taxes, many city officials claim they foster severe impacts on the city 
without offering revenues in return. Motels and hotels, on the other hand, must 
pay a 10% tax to the city from room rentals, considered vital revenue for the 
city's general fund.  
</P>
<P>
 Before the council vote, businessman Git Patel told the council he was in the 
midst of discussions on converting his motel to a time share and urged the 
council to abandon the moratorium idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are delaying business decisions that are being made right now," Patel 
said, adding that he was speaking for owners of three properties in Dana Point 
and Capistrano Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Patel is one of several property owners along "Time Share Row," a section of 
Pacific Coast Highway at the southern end of the city where the two current 
time share resorts are located, who hope to build new time shares, city 
officials said. An apartment owner in Monarch Beach has also discussed a 
conversion project with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Dana Point General Plan contains language that specifically 
discourages time shares, the old City Council -- before the June election -- 
appeared to be open to new time-share proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 But new council members Harold R. Kaufman and Toni Gallagher both voted for 
the moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Karen (Lloreda) and I have always been against time shares," said Councilman 
William L. Ossenmacher. "It looks like we picked up some support." LEN HALL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; CITY TO CONSIDER RENAMING PARK AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO

<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members next month will consider renaming part of Portola Park 
after the late Jesse Flores, a former major league pitcher and renowned scout 
who lived in the city from 1923 until his death in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores, who was 77 when he died, moved to the city from Mexico with his family 
when he was 8. After years of playing sandlot baseball in what is now Portola 
Park, Flores became the third Mexican American player -- the first Mexican 
American pitcher -- in the major leagues in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
 Mel Almada, a center fielder, and Chile Gomez, a second baseman, were the 
first and second Mexican Americans in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores played for the Chicago Cubs, Philadelphia Athletics and the Cleveland 
Indians in the major leagues and the Los Angeles Angels, San Diego Padres, 
Oakland Oaks, Sacramento Solons and the Portland Beavers in the Pacific Coast 
League for 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent the last 30 years of his life scouting for the Minnesota Twins and 
the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his career, Flores spent his off-season time developing baseball 
programs for local youths and adults. He organized a semipro baseball team, the 
La Habra Tigers, and managed it. He supplied the baseballs and bats and spent 
Sunday mornings watering and preparing a field at Portola Park for afternoon 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents remember Flores for teaching his players the fundamentals of the 
game and for inspiring a sense of leadership, discipline and fairness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jesse was a real good man, a friendly man to everybody. He did a lot for the 
youth of this city and he deserves to have something named after him," said 
Magdaleno Aguilar, who grew up on 4th Street -- the same street Flores lived 
on. "I used to go watch Jesse and the Tigers play at Portola Park all the time. 
He was an inspiration." 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar requested that the city rename Portola Park the Jesse Flores Park or 
name a baseball field there in Flores' honor. 
</P>
<P>
 A decision is expected at the Sept. 15 meeting.MIMI KOBASEBALL PLAY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; FATHER, SON ARRESTED IN SAILBOAT THEFT

<P>
 A father and son were arrested Wednesday on Lido Isle by Orange County 
sheriff's investigators after the pair boarded a $285,000 sailboat reported 
stolen Saturday in Dana Point Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaroslaw John Zymny, 48, and Alexander Loren Zymny, 22, who told police their 
last address was in Irvine, were booked at the Orange County Jail on suspicion 
of grand theft and burglary, according to Lt. Dick Olson of the sheriff's 
Harbor Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 The 43-foot craft Myriah, owned by an Indian Wells man, disappeared from its 
slip in the harbor, police said. At the time of its recovery, Olson said, 
investigators also recovered a 10-foot Avon dinghy tied alongside. The 
inflatable dinghy was reported stolen from Dana Point Harbor at the same time 
as the sailboat, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Paul Falk of the Harbor Patrol described the two men as transients who 
had recently come to the San Clemente area. 
</P>
<P>
 Police credited Todd & Associates, a San Diego-based marine investigation 
firm, with locating the stolen sailboat and contacting the Harbor Patrol. MARK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; FORESTRY GRANT TO LET CITY ADD 500 TREES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Newport Beach will receive a $30,000 urban forestry grant from the state 
Department of Forestry and Fire Protection to plant trees in public spaces 
around the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will let the city add new trees for the first time in two years.Before 
it was just trying to replace every tree that was lost (to) disease or storm or 
whatever," general services director David Niederhaus said.  
</P>
<P>
 In the last fiscal year, the city planted 200 replacement trees at an average 
cost of $94, Niederhaus said. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant money, due in October, will be added to $17,000 in city money -- a 
condition of the grant -- to fund 500 new trees for shadeless medians and 
parkways. 
</P>
<P>
 Niederhaus said the neighborhoods in line for trees are Corona del Mar, Balboa 
Peninsula, Eastbluff, Westcliff, Cameo Highlands, Buffalo Hills, Newport 
Heights and Irvine Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 Trees to be planted include magnolias, lemon-scented gums and sugar gums, 
Australian willows, jacarandas and Brisbane boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant also will help Newport Beach retain its reputation as Tree City, 
USA, a national honor it has won four years running. 
</P>
<P>
 Niederhaus said about 20 varieties of trees that have proven themselves hardy 
enough for the coastal climate will be planted.HOLLY J. WAGNER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; CITY TO BUY BUILDING, RAZE IT FOR PARKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Newport Beach will buy a vacant bank building near City Hall and 
raze it to put in a parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 In a closed session, the City Council voted Monday night to spend $787,500 to 
buy the Wells Fargo Bank building at 600 E. Balboa Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The building will be demolished to make way for a parking lot with 39 metered 
spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Kevin J. Murphy said the money will come from parking meter 
proceeds aimed at purchasing new public parking areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The city spent three months negotiating the deal to bring the price down from 
$1.4 million, Murphy said. As part of the deal, the city will allow Wells Fargo 
to keep an ATM on the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Public works employees are expected to have demolition and reconstruction 
plans ready to open bids within a month.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; COUNCIL ACTS TO EASE A PARKING PROBLEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council members have decided to require 48 Marian Street residents to get 
parking permits in order to help solve parking problems in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The move was in response to complaints from residents who said that members of 
Our Lady of Guadalupe Church park their cars on Marian Street and make it 
difficult for them to finda spot to park in front of their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very pleased," Esther Corral, a Marian Street resident said of the city's 
decision. She had asked officials to find a way to ease parking problems since 
the City Council last year approved construction of a homeless shelter, which 
has yet to be built, behind the church. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, some residents had complained that the shelter, Mary's Home for 
Transitional Families, may bring Marian Street even more parking problems. In 
response, the city came up with the parking permit idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary's Home officials said they believe the permits will ease residents' 
concerns about parking. The shelter has offered to pay the $15 cost of the 
permits. 
</P>
<P>
 The fee is a one-time cost and gives each household four permits, Assistant 
City Manager Kathy Kim said. If additional permits are needed they will be 
issued at no cost, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Once signs are posted, vehicles parked on Marian Street without a permit could 
either be towed or ticketed. The signs are expected to be up in the next few 
months. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; PLANNERS APPROVE RENOVATIONS AT PLAZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BEAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Planning Commission has approved most of a $2-million plan to renovate an 
entire historic downtown block across from Mission San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous vote Tuesday means that work on El Peon Plaza, a key commercial 
property in the heart of the city, could begin in about a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans call for transforming the complex's three aging buildings into a 
pedestrian mall, complete with skylights, interior walkway and 
5,000-square-foot restaurant at the southwest corner of Ortega Highway and El 
Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Nordeck, one of the project partners, said he hopes to award 
construction contracts in early October and have work finished by St. Joseph's 
Day, March 19, when the swallows make their annual return to the mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless an appeal to the City Council is filed, the project will proceed. It 
has already won the backing of the city's Design Review Committee and Cultural 
Heritage Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning commissioners had few questions Tuesday night as they looked over 
architectural drawings showing some of the exterior changes to the high-profile 
property. The project aims to preserve the character of the brick buildings, 
which will be reinforced to meet earthquake codes. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, Nordeck and Richard O'Neill, one of the county's wealthiest men, 
won the exclusive right to bid $1.1 million to the city for the property. 
Escrow is expected to close in a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the addition of skylights and an interior walkway, a pedestrian 
colonnade is slated for the south side of the complex. Some windows and doors 
will also be modified. 
</P>
<P>
 The buildings that make up El Peon complex total about 17,500 square feet. The 
complex also has a 3,200-square-foot courtyard. 
</P>
<P>
 When renovated, the complex will lose 1,100 square feet of building space. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for the courtyard, next to the proposed restaurant, have not yet been 
submitted to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Nordeck said the complex will have room for nine to 13 tenants, including the 
restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the complex will have a mix of specialty shops that cater to local 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole goal will be to provide new and improved retail establishments for 
the people of San Juan Capistrano first," Nordeck said. "This is for the people 
of San Juan first, tourists second." 
</P>
<P>
 Nordeck seeks an independent operator for the restaurant space. He said he was 
considering four types of fare, including "meat and potatoes." 
</P>
<P>
 And he said he's dropping the name, El Peon. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Farber, general partner and property manager of the nearby Franciscan 
Plaza, said he welcomes the new project. 
</P>
<P>
 Farber said that O'Neill would likely seek tenants who stay open past 5 p.m., 
the time at which many downtown retail shops close. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see it as a good addition to the downtown," Farber said. JEFF BEAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; STUDENTS TO STAY ON CAMPUS AT LUNCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beginning Sept. 9, Laguna Beach High School students will have to remain on 
campus for lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 Though most of the school's students have typically left campus at noon in 
previous years, the Laguna Beach Unified School District board voted 
unanimously Tuesday to corral the teens.The shift in tradition was opposed by 
most of the school's 730 students. 
</P>
<P>
 While many students felt it was unfair to limit their freedom and some have 
said being allowed to leave campus helps teens develop self-reliance and 
responsibility, the board was more concerned about "safety and student 
welfare," Supt. Paul M. Possemato said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They felt those were much more pressing and prevailing" needs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Possemato said, school officials feel a closed campus will help 
them involve more teens in lunchtime activities intended to build school spirit 
and boost student morale. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators, cafeteria operators, counselors and others met Wednesday to 
discuss ways to achieve that goal, Possemato said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, more commercial food services may be allowed on campus, the 
superintendent said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, about 500 to 600 students have typically left school each day for 
lunch, Possemato said. LESLIE EARNEST

MORE OIL-WATER MIX LEAKS REPORTED ON FULLERTON STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents of a mile-long stretch of State College Boulevard reported several 
leaks of an oil-water mixture from manhole covers Wednesday, a day after a 
similar spill in the same general area, between Chapman and Commonwealth 
avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's thick, it's not just a light film," said Walt Treadwell, who lives at 
State College and Commonwealth. 
</P>
<P>
 Treadwell said the pressure from the substance below the street pushed the 
manholes loose at three locations, sending what appeared to be hundreds of 
gallons into gutter areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleanup crews from the city of Fullerton, the Fullerton Fire Department, 
Unocal and Fullerton Waste Water were on the scene. A spokesman for the Fire 
Department said the cleanup was being handled by Unocal, but a corporate 
spokesman said the line from which the substance came did not belong to them.

ROAD REDESIGN COMMITTEE IS SEEKING APPLICANTS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents who want to help redesign Laguna Canyon Road from El Toro Road to 
the San Diego Freeway can apply to be part of a committee being formed for that 
purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 While unwilling to endorse a design preferred by the county that calls for the 
winding road to be moved several hundred yards west of its location, the City 
Council has endorsed widening the road to four lanes and moving it away from 
three area lakes. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials have said they will continue working with the city to try to 
resolve the differences and suggested that the city appoint a five- to 
seven-member committee to consider design alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee should include people with expertise in road design and 
construction as well as other residents, according to a notice released by the 
city. Members will work with representatives from the city, county and state to 
evaluate design alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Interested residents should obtain an application from the city clerk and file 
it by 5 p.m. Sept. 1. Applicants will be interviewed by the City Council on 
Sept. 6 at 6 p.m. in council chambers. 
</P>
<P>

2 MINORITY GROUP LEADERS SEEK TO EASE INMATE TENSIONS; VIOLENCE: THEY PLAN TO 
TALK TO SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT OFFICIALS ABOUT THE RECENT RACIALLY MOTIVATED 
CLASHES BETWEEN BLACKS AND LATINOS AT COUNTY JAILS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Disturbed by a recent series of violent outbursts between black and Latino 
inmates at Orange County jails, two leaders of the minority communities said 
Wednesday they plan to try to defuse tensions there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eugene Wheeler, president of 100 Black Men of Orange County, and Amin David, 
chairman of Los Amigos of Orange County, a Latino civil rights advocacy group, 
said they conferred Wednesday morning about the racially motivated clashes and 
will talk to officials of the Sheriff's Department, which runs the jails. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very alarmed about it. . . . I think all of us feel it is senseless," 
Wheeler said of the racial clashes at the jails. 
</P>
<P>
 David said he and Wheeler intend "to express our concern and find out what is 
happening. One of the options we will consider seriously is requesting the 
grand jury to look into this." 
</P>
<P>
 Wheeler said he believed that the jailhouse strife may relate to a videotape 
televised Aug. 2 that showed a black Compton police officer beating a Latino 
youth with a baton after the latter confronted the officer during an 
investigation. The video stirred allegations of police brutality. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that the outbreak of jail violence occurred soon after, Wheeler said 
the videotape "seemed to have heightened the antagonism (prisoners in the 
county jails) have against each other." The Orange County Sheriff's Department 
on Wednesday released a summary of 10 racially motivated confrontations between 
inmates that occurred over two weeks this month at the Central Men's Jail in 
Santa Ana and the Theo Lacy Branch Jail in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Dan Martini, who wrote the report, said all the incidents followed a 
pattern of strife between groups of blacks and Latinos. He credited the fast 
reaction of the jail staff for preventing major injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Sheriff John (Rocky) Hewitt said overcrowding at county jails 
probably has played a role in the fighting, though officials have not found a 
specific cause for the disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
 Hewitt noted that while the Orange County Jail system was built to house 3,203 
prisoners, on any given day there are more than 5,000 inmates. Last week, he 
said, there were 5,300. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have a situation where you have overcrowding, any incident can 
trigger" fighting, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Activists in the Latino community also blamed overcrowding. 
</P>
<P>
 "The failure of the Board of Supervisors to provide adequate jail space in the 
county is leading to these kinds of racial tensions," said Art Montez, 
president of the Santa Ana chapter of the League of United Latin American 
Citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Martini's report, the first fight broke out the afternoon of Aug. 
8 among black and Latino inmates on a Sheriff's Department bus, followed by a 
second clash that evening among about 40 black and Latino inmates, in a 
dormitory at the Central Men's Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 During dinner on Aug. 11, the report said, a black inmate complained about a 
green tint in his mashed potatoes and burns on his mouth. Jail officials said a 
Latino inmate may have put a caustic chemical in the food, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another disturbance occurred during an evening meal Aug. 13 at the Central 
Men's Jail when some Latino inmates shouted racial slurs at blacks.  
</P>
<P>
 At breakfast the next day fighting broke out. By the time deputies in riot 
gear stopped the fighting, 30 inmates had suffered minor injuries. Two staff 
members suffered minor cuts or scratches when they were struck by food trays. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other disturbances occurred in the following days. 
</P>
<P>
 The unrest spread to the Theo Lacy jail by Aug. 17, the report said, when 
deputies there intercepted a note indicating that Latino inmates were planning 
to attack black inmates in retaliation for the attacks at Central Men's Jail. 
</P>
<P>
 That evening, about 30 Latino inmates attacked about 15 blacks in a day room. 
Four inmates were treated for minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Other disturbances followed in the next few days. 
</P>
<P>
 The report concluded that "the jail environment houses criminals with 
backgrounds of non-social behavior. This behavior does not improve inside the 
jail system where living conditions are crowded and tempers short." 
</P>
<P>
 Martini said it "would be ludicrous" to try to segregate prisoners by race for 
their protection. Also, he said he doubted that it would be feasible to change 
racist attitudes among inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we could negotiate an agreeable and non-combative attitude 
among the races in these institutions," he said.

HIS LOOSE LIPS GET A PRESIDENTIAL SEAL; POLITICS: SUDDENLY, ONE OF THE 
CHATTIEST MEN TO OCCUPY THE WHITE HOUSE IS QUIET AS A MOUSE. IT'S NOT EASY FOR 
BILL CLINTON -- OR THE PRESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Waves of Cubans were fleeing to Florida, his health and crime bills were 
barely dodging doom, but the only question President Clinton would touch at his 
ritual morning jog earlier this week had to do with the injured Achilles tendon 
of Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's better," Clinton allowed grudgingly -- then clammed up tight. 
</P>
<P>
 In a month of stunning surprises from Washington, this one surely ranks among 
them: Bill Clinton, maybe the chattiest man ever to occupy the Oval Office, is 
suddenly rationing his conversation like Calvin (Silent Cal) Coolidge. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two weeks, he's done none of the photo opportunities that he has 
long used for run-on lectures on topics from the federal deficit to defense 
conversion. He's taken reporters' questions on only two occasions, and is 
threatening to hold to the new tack indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Urging the new policy was new Chief of Staff Leon Panetta, who, adopting a 
view long held by the Washington punditocracy, argued that Clinton has been 
stepping on his daily message and hurting his presidential image with his 
endless rope-line stridulations. The common view at the White House is now that 
Clinton has been both overexposed and underexposed, and that he needs to save 
his wind for occasions that he can better control. 
</P>
<P>
 The new policy has spawned a guessing game in Washington on how long the 
onetime professor will be able to overcome the habit of a lifetime and keep his 
yap shut. Some people wonder what kind of internal tensions the new discipline 
must be building in a man who has so long used popping off as an emotional 
release. 
</P>
<P>
 "This won't last," predicted Michael K. Deaver, who built his image-making 
plan for President Ronald Reagan around the same principle. Noting that Clinton 
has tried and failed on earlier moments to stick to the program, Deaver 
ventured that such silence would be "constitutionally impossible" for the 
Arkansan. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Hess, a Brookings Institution scholar who worked for four Presidents 
in speech writing and other roles, agreed. "He knows intellectually that this 
has to be done. . . . But this habit is genetically programmed. We can expect 
that there will be some falling off." 
</P>
<P>
 One White House aide acknowledged that keeping mum was no easy task for 
Clinton, and conjectured that others around the President would have to pick up 
the conversational slack. "This is not a man who is going to go without," this 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Oval Office's sepulchral silence has made life a bit harder for the 
wire-service and television reporters who have come to rely on Clinton's daily 
effusions to make a living. In a more gregarious incarnation, Clinton would 
frequently take questions from reporters on two or three occasions in a single 
day, sometimes rattling on for four minutes to answer a single query. 
</P>
<P>
 Now reporters who used to entreat press aides to hold news conferences are 
balefully asking if Clinton would allow more photo-ops -- occasions in which 
Presidents were available to be photographed but rarely responded to questions. 
Pre-Clinton, the moments were considered of scant value. 
</P>
<P>
 In the absence of meatier fare, one wire service correspondent was threatening 
earlier this week to write a story about a White House secretary's trip to the 
dentist. "It's grim," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Santos, a White House reporter with United Press International, said the 
August chat drought has not yet left the wire service corps to spend their time 
playing pinochle and filling out expense reports. But the news flow "is a 
little lighter," she allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 The new, more coy Clinton has had a very real impact on the network television 
correspondents, who like to have fresh footage of the President -- preferably 
answering one of their questions -- every day. Now they are resorting to shots 
of the President ignoring them, much like the footage they regularly used when 
Reagan was skipper. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, Clinton used a Rose Garden appearance as an opportunity to 
lobby for the crime bill. But he took no questions, and when NBC's Jim 
Miklaszewski shouted a query about Cuba, Clinton continued strolling away. 
</P>
<P>
 In the evening broadcast, all three networks used the clip, because it was all 
they had. 
</P>
<P>
 "It must be killing him inside not to speak," Miklaszewski said. "You can 
actually see him break stride, because he wants to answer. But then he's been 
going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Miklaszewski says that Clinton has been more successful at keeping mum than 
any President he's seen -- so far, anyway. Indeed, all recent Presidents have 
shared to a greater or lesser extent this desire to target their 
pronouncements. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 George Bush began his term as a chatty guy, but by the end he struggled to 
reduce his verbal output. John F. Kennedy feared that the coming of television 
would diminish the dignity of the office and strictly limited his appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's loquacity has become one of the distinguishing characteristics of 
his Adminstration. But it has gotten him repeatedly into trouble, including 
several times this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, his think-aloud musings at a National Governors Assn. convention 
in Boston brought protests from Democrats that he seemed to be backing away 
from his previous demand that Congress provide health insurance to all 
Americans in its legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was the now-notorious MTV interview in which Clinton acknowledged 
his preference for briefs over boxer shorts -- a shared intimacy that has 
brought mockery from even such usual allies as Rep. Lee Hamilton (D-Ind.), 
chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. "We don't know what the 
(foreign) policy is, but we know what kind of underwear he wears," Hamilton 
grumbled recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's Democratic allies on Capitol Hill, who have so many reasons to be 
glum these days, are jubilant at Clinton's new resolve. "So many people have 
wanted this," said one senior Democratic House aide. "If he sticks to this, 
it'll really help." 
</P>
<P>
 And if he doesn't, he added, "well, I don't think people will be all that 
surprised."

THE 'AHA' MOMENT: VACATION EPIPHANY; REVELATIONS: SOME VACATIONERS RETURN 
REFRESHED AND READY TO GO; OTHERS REALIZE THEY WANT TO TRADE THEIR LIVES IN FOR 
NEW ONES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN KELLEHER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You know the drill. You take the long-awaited summer vacation, with all of its 
requisite joys and hassles. 
</P>
<P>
 You spend a couple of weeks removed from the Skinner box that is your 
so-called life and come back rested and rejuvenated -- ready for your workaday 
life to resume, even if it does take a day or two to adjust. 
</P>
<P>
 But some vacationers have found that disengaging from their humdrum routines 
in order to spend time in a faraway, unfamiliar or beautiful locale has changed 
their lives -- inspiring career switches, lifestyle changes or cross-country 
moves. Experts say that such instant revelations -- some call them "aha!" 
moments -- happen most often to those who feel unfulfilled and who undergo 
perception shifts that enable them to see a new direction or choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Such was the case 16 years ago when Barbara Wolf and her husband, Bertil, took 
a "consciousness-raising trip" to Israel sponsored by their local Jewish 
Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 On the airplane flight over, Barbara Wolf -- non-religious and inactive in the 
Jewish community -- became mesmerized by a headline in a newspaper being read 
by a nearby passenger about the 40th anniversary of Kristallnacht, the night in 
1938 when the Nazis went on a rampage, shattering windows and setting fires to 
Jewish homes and synagogues. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon reading the article, "all of the sudden I became acutely aware that the 
Holocaust had something to do with me," Wolf said. "It was an arresting moment 
. . . a very powerful moment. I was intellectually aroused." 
</P>
<P>
 Five days later at Yad Vashem, a Holocaust memorial in Jerusalem, Wolf, then 
40, split off from the group and went to the Hall of Names archives. It was 
closed off with velvet ropes, but she went in anyway and found the names of 
about 40 of her husband's relatives from the Netherlands who had perished in 
the Holocaust. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very spiritual . . . emotional experience," she said, adding that 
she quit her job as a nurse when she returned to Swampscott, Mass., and became 
the editor of a Jewish journal, later winning five awards from the American 
Jewish Press Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was shaking and I still have the notes I scribbled," said Wolf, who 
traveled to the concentration camps and attended her husband's family reunion 
in the Netherlands a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It crystallized a lot of things for me . . . that I could make a commitment 
to (this) . . . it was a connectedness to my history. It was like a switch. 
That experience eclipsed what went on on the rest of that trip in terms of 
socialization." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Such experiences are like personal lightning strikes, said Chaytor Mason, 
emeritus associate professor of human factors/psychology at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expose parts of ourselves that we don't look at on a day-to-day basis 
because of the demands of the workaday world," Mason said. "Vacations demand 
different parts of ourselves and may get us in touch with unsatisfied and 
unfulfilled aspects of ourselves (such as) childhood dreams. The experience for 
a lot of people is 'this is the real me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Mason said the opportunity to reflect and explore different aspects of 
ourselves increases the potential for a gestalt, a psychological term for an 
experience that allows a person to see the overall meaning of things instead of 
just its parts. 
</P>
<P>
 James Peters' "aha!" moment hit last August when he was in Minneapolis for a 
vacation and a long-distance swimming competition. Peters, a competitive 
swimmer since high school, had always been driven by a "killer instinct," 
unapologetically climbing over other racers or herding them into buoys during 
indoor or ocean races. 
</P>
<P>
 The day the 700 competitors were scheduled to swim indoor races at the 
University of Minnesota, Peters decided to ride his bike the 20 miles along the 
Mississippi River from St. Louis Park to the Minneapolis campus pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "I rode my bike down along the river and there wasn't a gun going off and I 
wasn't racing and I thought, 'I can do this for enjoyment,' " said Peters, who 
thinks his turning 30 on the trip compounded the revelation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I rode down to Minnehaha Falls . . . it's a 100-foot drop and it flows into 
the Mississippi River," he said. "I . . . thought, 'Why am I doing this? I 
don't think I need to do this to prove myself anymore. What does this race have 
to do with the big scheme of things?' It ceased to have any benefit except to 
go out and beat the clock. It got to be empty." 
</P>
<P>
 Peters, a self-described "computer geek" at Mobil Oil Co. in Dallas, missed 
the race and hasn't competed since. Now, Peters says, when he swims and bikes 
he stops "to smell the flowers instead of hammering past them." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Mark Goulston, a UCLA assistant clinical psychology professor, said vacations 
are a readout on whether or not you are happy with your life. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you are happy, you come back rested and reinvigorated . . . but if you're 
unhappy with your life, there is almost a phobic feeling about restarting where 
you left off. There is an irony to vacations in that they make you realize you 
have a choice . . . that you don't have to live this rat race." 
</P>
<P>
 "Competing . . . pushing, shoving and racing to get everything done" is the 
way Mary Webster described her life in Hartford, Conn., where she and her 
husband, Doug, had lived most of their lives. The couple had fantasized for 
years about moving to Northern California, but they feared uprooting themselves 
and losing the money they had invested in property. Then, about three years 
ago, they took a trip that became a turning point. Where they once perceived 
obstacles, they saw plausible opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 After staying in romantic hotels in Mendocino and the Napa Valley, floating 
over Napa in a hot-air balloon and going winery hopping by train, the Websters 
drove to San Francisco. The decision to move 3,000 miles became clear for Mary 
Webster when they crossed the Golden Gate Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was October. It was perfect out here. It was magic," said Mary Webster, a 
nurse and mother of three adult children. "It was as if someone were laying out 
everything to make this trip extraordinary." 
</P>
<P>
 Any remaining doubts evaporated when the Websters joined 300,000 people in 
Golden Gate Park, where the Grateful Dead, Joan Baez and other musicians 
performed a free concert in tribute to the late promoter Bill Graham. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were looking at all these people in the park and we thought these people 
live like this every day in the sun," said Doug Webster, a public relations 
executive. "So we just talked to all these people that we were cheek-to-jowl 
with and they all said they loved it here. All these people at one point picked 
up and moved from wherever they were to San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
 The Websters "lost their shirt" when they sold their Hartford home below the 
market price and moved across the country to "their little paradise" in the 
Berkeley Hills, where they are so content they vacation at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug and Mary Webster, both 51, said that before they had their mutual 
vacation epiphany, they had only explored the idea of moving "intellectually," 
resigning themselves to life in Hartford. But after the couple experienced 
their realization, which they likened to an emotional switch, the move was easy 
to make. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided we really didn't have to live (like we had been)," Mary Webster 
said. "If other people could do this, we could."

WAIF NOT; THE MODELING WORLD IS A FICKLE PLACE. WAIFS ARE OUT AND GLAMOUR IS 
IN--AGAIN. FASHION WRITER MAUREEN SAJBEL LOOKS AT THE EVER-SHIFTING NOTION OF 
WHAT THE IDEAL FEMALE FORM SHOULD BE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wave goodby to waifs. Those irritatingly gaunt, vacant-looking models so 
popular last year have disappeared from this fall's batch of ads and 
editorials. 
</P>
<P>
 Their replacements? Two 16-year-olds who can look a decade older, a few 
healthy girls from next door, and a 5-foot-11, platinum-haired model nicknamed 
"the Cyber Princess." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting back toward the glamazon look of the '80s: bigger, taller, 
busty models. Still no hips," says Valerie Steele, professor at New York's 
Fashion Institute of Technology and author of "Fashion and Eroticism" (Oxford 
University Press, 1985). "It's a pendulum back. The difference between now and 
the '80s is that it's not as excessive. Not as much flesh. Not as much muscle. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're never going to see another Rachel Williams, that overly muscular 
look," agrees Eileen Ford, founder of Ford Modeling Inc. "This is a return to 
being natural and a return to looking good without looking weird." 
</P>
<P>
 What characterizes the post-waif look, says Preston Westenburg, Vogue magazine 
bookings editor, is accessibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're now pulling back from that extreme to something that's much more pretty 
and attainable without being overblown and super-sexy," Westenburg says. 
"Models like Kirsty Hume and Bridget Hall have it. Then there's Nadja Auermann. 
She has a very strong womanly image and she's incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Berlin-born Nadja Auermann, 23, leads the pack of new, stronger, sexier, more 
glamorous models. Auermann scored both the coveted September covers of Vogue (a 
waist-up shot of her in a hot pink silk dress and yellow shearling) and 
Harper's Bazaar (a severe, feline, Newton-esque close-up.) 
</P>
<P>
 Her movie-star platinum locks, legs that go for a mile and exotic face have 
been called everything from Dietrich-esque to alien-like. Reportedly, Auermann 
is always on time, has perfect posture and behaves in a serious manner rarely 
seen in the immature, egocentric world of modeling. Other models, she 
complained to Vogue writer Katherine Betts, "take two-hour lunch breaks, never 
stop talking. I was like, 'I want to work.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And she does, appearing currently in high-profile ads for Valentino, Versace, 
and as one of three vamps in the black-and-white ads for Anne Klein. 
</P>
<P>
 Also dominating the post-waif scene are Bridget Hall and the single monikered 
Brandi, 16-year-olds who follow the old modeling dictum that says you should 
act grown up -- even though you've barely passed puberty. Brandi has been a 
Chanel print model for the last year, while Bridget Hall's classical looks have 
recently netted her a six-figure contract with Ralph Lauren's Safari perfume 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Gandee noted in his less-than-flattering portrait of Hall for Vogue 
that the $10,000-a-day Texas model is a ninth-grade dropout who likes to eat 
chili from a can. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't need girls who know which fork to use," says the straight-talking 
Westenburg. "We don't grow models in petri dishes. They come from all different 
backgrounds, all walks of life, all economic brackets." Hall, she says, sets a 
standard in approachable, pretty looks -- exactly what the magazine is looking 
for now. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper's Bazaar recently anointed Scotland's 18-year-old Kirsty Hume 
"modeling's new star." Her long, wheat-blond hair, classic good looks and 
flawless skin captured famed fashion photographer Patrick Demarchelier's 
attention in Paris. "Right away I could see she had personality. I like the 
models with character," he says. Demarchelier's photo of Hume appeared on the 
July Bazaar cover, and since then she's done ads for everyone from Gucci and 
TSE Cashmere to the Gap. 
</P>
<P>
 Comparatively ancient at 22, Oregon-based model Debbie Deitering is CNN 
fashion maven Elsa Klensch's choice for rising star. Deitering, who made the 
leap from waif to post-waif, appears this fall in ads for Joan Vass, Ellen 
Tracy's new Company line and Anne Klein II. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deitering is determined to change as fashion does," Klensch rhapsodizes. 
"She's now glowing with health and happy that she's part of the new glamorous 
mood for models. The look is more feminine, with more makeup and shine. Models 
must be able to capture this new mood." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The modeling world's shifting taste is nothing new. FIT's Steele offers a 
thumbnail sketch of the Ping-Ponging changes in America's dream girl: 
</P>
<P>
 "In the '60s, while everyone talked about Twiggy, models like Jean Shrimpton 
were more typical -- a girlish look, girlfriend of a rock star. You could see 
them being called chicks.  
</P>
<P>
 "The '70s started with a wider range of ethnic looks, with Beverly Johnson the 
first black woman on the cover of Vogue. By the late '70s, things had gotten 
back to the healthy blond: Christie Brinkley, Lauren Hutton, Lisa Taylor, Patti 
Hansen. Jerry Hall is very much a '70s model -- blond, healthy, not soft. More 
Helmut Newton looking." 
</P>
<P>
 In the '80s, Steele says, Cindy Crawford, Paulina Porizkova and Naomi Campbell 
epitomized the big, ultra-glamorous look. The '90s began with odd looks that 
were its opposite -- in the form of tiny Kate Moss, androgynous Kristin 
McMenamy and the waifs. 
</P>
<P>
 The urge to move on to a new idealized female silhouette was brought about by 
two forces: fashion and economics. "Grunge and neo-hippie clothes fit the 
waif," notes fashion historian Steele. "These new models work with the 
tight-to-the-body, shorter fashions. You're seeing more curve, more leg." 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, consumers refused to take the malnourished waifs to their 
collective breast. Sorting through 1993 women's fashion magazine newsstand 
sales statistics supplied by the Audit Bureau of Circulation, Women's Wear 
Daily's marketing/media analyst Lisa Lockwood concluded that "issues with waifs 
and men as cover images often came in dead last on the newsstand." 
</P>
<P>
 Poor little waif Amber Valleta graced both the cover of Harper's Bazaar's 
worst seller and Allure's weak-selling September issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The waif look was not a huge success because the American woman didn't find 
it attractive," says Vogue's Westenburg. While the waif was necessary to break 
down the wall of "super sexy glam vixens of the '80s," she believes it was only 
a diversion. "It wasn't pretty. The clothes were very young. Too young." 
</P>
<P>
 So where does all this leave waif poster girl Kate Moss? 
</P>
<P>
 Moss will survive, Westenburg explains, because she attained supermodel status 
(the term applies to her position in the modeling world -- not her size) and 
became a household name. In fact, Moss has begun to metamorphose in front of 
the camera with a little help from a comb, tube of lipstick and a bit of 
much-needed blush.

FASHION / CAFE SOCIETY: BY DESIGN; BORN TO BE WILDLY UNDERDRESSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHELE SEIPP 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Place: Thunder Roadhouse, a motorcycle-themed restaurant, 8371 Sunset 
Blvd., West Hollywood; (213) 650-6011. 
</P>
<P>
 Atmosphere: A casual mix of curious, gawking, tourists; hip yuppie bikers, and 
scowling, Hell's Angels-type bikers. Both types of bikers perform identical 
arrival rituals: Pull up in a deafening roar, peruse the other bikes parked 
outside, then swagger coolly into the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Serving-Up Style: Cocktail waitresses wear black hot pants, black tank tops 
and '70s-style turquoise jewelry. Waiters wear "Thunder Roadhouse" T-shirts 
with black shorts or black pants. 
</P>
<P>
 Customer Style: Yuppie bikers wear jeans, T-shirts and sleeveless leather 
motorcycle vests. The hard-core bikers are evident by their fully exposed beer 
bellies -- only partially concealed by leather vests and leather pants. They 
wear motorcycle boots or cowboy boots. Biker chicks wear bra tops, snug jeans, 
sneers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hair Apparent: Yuppie bikers favor short, fashion-boy dos or neat ponytails. 
The hard-cores like long, straggly ponytails (often with sweaty, bald pates), 
ultra-hairy nestlike beards and mustaches -- some accented by a skinny 
beard-braid down the middle. Biker chicks' hair come in two styles: long and 
stringy or wild lioness. 
</P>
<P>
 Accessories: Motorcycle helmets, chains, medallions, impenetrable wraparound 
sunglasses that make one look like a jumbo fly, tattoos, cigarettes, mustache 
and beard combs. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardinal Rule: If thou art a nerdy tourist, thou must stand outside in front 
of a huge Harley and poseth with thy hands on thy hips, thy countenance grim, 
whilst thy friend snappeth thy pictureth. 
</P>
<P>
 Observations: Conversation is minimal among the hard-core, who alight like 
huge birds at the bar, sit silently with their beer and cigarettes, and move 
only infrequently to rub or comb their long, bushy beards. Occasionally, they 
peer from beneath their grizzled eyebrows at passersby. 
</P>

 Parting Thoughts: "There's a difference between the yuppie bikers and the

too." MICHELE SEIPP

BY DESIGN; Q & A; ALLEN BRUCE SCHWARTZ; A COOL COPYCAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles garment manufacturer a.b.s. is at the eye of an international 
fashion storm. Named for founder and design director Allen Bruce Schwartz, the 
$50-million company made its mark by offering timely, high-quality copies of 
more expensive designs through its own boutiques, Saks Fifth Avenue, 
Bloomingdale's, Macy's, Neiman Marcus and Bullock's. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, Gianni Versace launched a public attack on Schwartz after a 
version of the Milanese designer's pink safety-pinned punk dress turned up in 
the window of an a.b.s. boutique in South Miami Beach right next door to 
Versace's new store. 
</P>
<P>
 At that time, Schwartz was unavailable for comment. He'd started his summer 
vacation to escape the obsessive glare of publicity surrounding close friend 
O.J. Simpson. ("I believe in his innocence totally.") But as a.b.s.' 
spring-summer 1995 line -- which includes many couture-inspired looks -- heads 
to market, the 49-year-old Schwartz talked about Versace's charges with writer 
Maureen Sajbel. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Designers and retail stores have done quick, less expensive copies 
of haute couture and European ready-to-wear clothes since WWII. Why do you 
think there's a heated debate now over copying? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: It's strictly a bully tactic. (Other designers) see us coming up with 
similar feelings and trends that are open to anybody. They get nervous. They 
start threatening stores like Saks and Macy's and Bloomingdale's, and going 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 The nerve of this guy, Versace, walking into an a.b.s. boutique and making one 
of my girls cry and causing a scene. Like he was a Picasso. I called the 
landlord and said next time he came in I'm calling the police. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is it true you had a fairly accurate duplicate of his pink dress with the 
safety pins in the window? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, but I want you to know where this comes from. This comes from street 
fashion. There are girls walking around with safety pins in their belly 
buttons, in their noses. We see the same things. My design team is combing the 
streets of London, Paris, St. Tropez, Soho, thrift shops, Melrose, 
Tribeca,everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Have you been sued or threatened? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Absolutely not. He hasn't even written a letter. I will tell you that Mr. 
Versace is the one who better look in the mirror. He's the big knockoff guy. He 
knocks off Chanel. And then he puts his own flair on it. He's not doing 
anything new. The Versace line that I see looks like a direct copy of the 
wardrobe of "Miami Vice" of 10 years ago, with all the pinks, pastels, bright 
colors and Nik-Nik shirts that came in engineered prints. He just made them in 
the '90s and took credit for it. Isn't it funny that Giorgio (Armani) or Karl 
(Lagerfeld)never make mention of (the subject of copies)? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: They don't have stores right next to yours. 
</P>
<P>
 A: I think Versace saw the thing staring him in the face. So he got his Irish 
up. That's his problem. I think he threatened to pull his line out of several 
stores. He insinuated that a.b.s. has dresses similar to his. Well you know 
what? That's what I'm all about. I'm about making runway clothing for $3,500 
that I interpret to look right at $180 to $230. That's my genius. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's a comparison of price? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The Versace-type dress that he mentioned this particular time was about 
$1,200. Ours was $140. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You've admitted that you once took an Armani jacket apart to see how it was 
constructed. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Absolutely. I admire the construction of Armani's clothing. I'm inspired 
every single day of my waking life . . . by what a cab driver is wearing for a 
hat . . . by a fabric that Armani may run. Anything can inspire me. I'm tuned 
in. I'm not going to sit here and tell you that I've never looked at an Armani 
or Versace. If they want to be honest, they probably have done the same thing, 
conversely speaking.  
</P>
<P>
 My real inspiration comes from movies, the street and the timeliness of what's 
happening. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: There must have been some land-speed record broken last year after the 
couture showed short skirts. Barely had we seen them in the pages of Women's 
Wear Daily when you had them in your stores. 
</P>
<P>
 A: In a week. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: With that kind of speed, can you virtually match any trend going on? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Absolutely. That's why a.b.s. is getting all this constructive criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You consider this constructive? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Absolutely. When that Versace article broke, we must have had 100 calls 
that day from buyers for appointments to come up and see our line who'd never 
bought our line. Specialty store owners throughout the country who said, 'Gee, 
we didn't know you did those looks. We always wanted a version of that for a 
little less money.' It's the finest form of flattery. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Any downside? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The downside is when they don't talk about you. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you think of the verdict in the Yves Saint Laurent vs. Ralph Lauren 
case, in which Saint Laurent successfully sued Lauren for copying his women's 
tuxedo dress? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I really felt that it was an overplay and I think it will probably be 
reversed anyway. It was grandstanding by Saint Laurent. And it was tried in 
Europe. If it came to the States, it would have made it into the paper for 
about a minute. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you say to answer a statement made by a Saint Laurent lawyer: "Each 
time a piece is copied, its value diminishes. From the moment the clientele 
sees a dress everywhere, they lose interest." 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's hogwash. There's no such thing as a woman coming in from Connecticut 
to buy her couture and sitting and having caviar at a department store and 
buying her whole wardrobe. There may be a quarter of 1% of the population that 
buys that way today. That customer is over. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You're not counterfeiting. That's a completely different thing -- that's 
illegal. What you're doing -- closely inspired designs traditionally called 
knockoffs -- is perfectly legal. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Absolutely. Fashion is open to anybody. That's what fashion is. Should we 
turn our back on a kilt because someone else innovates it? If I innovate a 
stretch dress or taffeta, is someone else going to say, 'Oh I better not do 
this'? What is this? Being on the trend is what drives the whole business. 
That's what's driving a.b.s.

 Case in point: Iced-tea-chugging model Vendela this week offered a semi-nude 
photo of herself as cover art for an album of songs by women. But the 
cancer-research group benefiting from sales of "Women for Women" says the shot 
-- in which Vendela's perky breasts are covered by her own hands -- isn't their 
cup of tea. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still healthy and won't put off men from thinking about breast cancer," 
Vendela said in the New York Post, justifying her pin-up girl pose. "We didn't 
want to scare people off." Wrong answer, girlfriend!  
</P>
<P>
 "Vendela's picture and words do not in any way fit with the album's purpose," 
said Amy Langer, executive director of the National Alliance of Breast Cancer 
Organizations and a cancer survivor. Indeed, Mark Fine, senior vice president 
of Hammer & Lace Records, told the Associated Press that Vendela would not be 
on the cover. 
</P>
<P>
 Chin up, Vendela. The guys at Sports Illustrated still love ya.

 Diamonds Are Forever: "Women make the best designers," said Marc Jacobs, 
chain-smoking and slurping coffee this week in the lobby of the Sunset Marquis 
Hotel. Male designers, he said, are better at creating spectacles.  
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year-old darling of the fashion world laughs at the sound of such Big 
Pronouncements. But they tumble out, prompted, of course, by the sorts of 
questions put to fashion designers. "Life is not a runway," he notes, sagely. 
Then, after a lengthy explanation of how clothes are just things , he observes: 
"That's what makes me young and modern."  
</P>
<P>
 Diamonds, too, are just things, which Jacobs scattered in unexpected shapes 
and places throughout his fall collection. He was in L.A. with his collection 
-- called Scatter Diamonds -- for a tea at Neiman Marcus on Tuesday. Why 
diamonds? "I was using the finest materials for my fall clothes, so why not use 
the most precious stones for the jewelry?" Why not, indeed.

 Dressed to Convict: Just when we thought we'd seen her entire courtroom 
wardrobe, prosecutor Marcia Clark showed up for Monday's preliminary hearing in 
the O.J. Simpson case wearing The White Dress. 
</P>
<P>
 "What did it mean ?" pondered court-watchers. "Who designed it?" they asked. 
"What kind of shoes do you suppose she was wearing?" wondered one woman, 
frustrated by the infrequency of full-length shots by court cameras. 
"Black-and-white spectator pumps would have been perfect!" chirped another to 
no one in particular.  
</P>
<P>
 All we can say is that no one switches from a steady uniform of ill-fitting 
dark suits to a simple white sheath and pearl choker without a reason. While 
all parties concerned talked about blood, blood, blood, Clark appeared 
downright angelic, unbesmirched by the gruesomeness at hand. Then again, maybe 
it was the only clean thing in her closet.

 The Winters of Our Discontent: In "Color Me Beautiful," Carole Jackson showed 
us why we might look washed out or overwhelmed in our favorite colors. You're a 
Spring, darling! Now, Jackson protege Darlene Mathis has applied seasonal color 
theory to women of color. Using clients from her Washington, D.C., salon, 
Mathis demonstrates the technique in "Women of Color: The Multicultural Guide 
to Fashion and Beauty" (One World/Ballantine Books). 
</P>
<P>
 Within us all, Mathis claims, lurks a color personality. Thus, a spring woman 
"is as capricious as nature, and often as delicate as her season. The colors of 
her palette -- yellow, lime green and sea blue -- are as light, bright and 
whimsical as her personality." If that fails to strike a chord, perhaps you're 
a winter, a "tall and imposing" gal -- although you may be short -- who's long 
on "climatic coloring of clear, primary colors." Think Oprah Winfrey, Lena 
Horne and Connie Chung. 
</P>
<P>
 Since we've always thought of ourself as a capricious drama queen, we wondered 
where we fit on the colorscape? Thankfully, Mathis says it's OK to have 
seasonal palettes rising or "adds," as she calls those colors not exactly in 
our prescribed palette. These colors are within us, she explains, and thus 
acceptable under certain circumstances. Thank you, Darlene.

 And the Winner Is: The ballots had been tallied up by Price Waterhouse, the 
nominees notified. All was proceeding smoothly for California Mart's Oct. 9 
awards ceremony honoring the California Designer of the Year and Rising Star. 
But hold the phone. Recount the ballots. Richard Tyler has been removed from 
Designer of the Year competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't actually decline the nomination," says Lisa Trafficante, Tyler's 
wife and business partner. But Tyler's busy schedule -- "doing the Anne Klein 
show, our show and reintroducing the men's line" -- left the company no time to 
stage the fashion show that's a mandatory part of the Mart's awards ceremony. 
"It's a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 One California designer isn't buying it. "It's not like he has to fly in Naomi 
and Kate," says Maggie Barry of the Van Buren design team. "He has the staff to 
stitch up more samples." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, Tyler is L.A.'s most celebrated designer. But where's his hometown 
spirit? Which reminds us, isn't it high time we returned to Long Beach?

FASHION / SCREEN STYLE: A PAIR OF NATURAL BORN STYLE SETTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY GOODWIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Movie: "Natural Born Killers." 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: During and after a cold-blooded murder spree, killers Mickey (Woody 
Harrelson) and Mallory (Juliette Lewis) become national cult heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costume Designer: Richard Hornung, whose credits include "The Hudsucker 
Proxy," "Barton Fink," "Raising Arizona," "The Grifters," "Young Guns" and 
"Dave." 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: Let's start with the killing couple's wedding rings -- twin coiled 
snakes. Nasty. (Snakes also appear as an applique design on Mickey's cowboy 
boots and again as a body tattoo, while Mallory prefers a scorpion tattoo at 
her waist.) 
</P>
<P>
 Between the menacing symbolism -- Mickey's buglike red sunglasses and 
on-screen head-shaving scene -- and Mallory's blond, budget-Bardot wigs, this 
is a pair of lowlifes, pure and simple. Take away Harrelson's and Lewis' cute 
faces and bods, and Mickey and Mallory are two people you wouldn't want to meet 
alone in a dark alley. Times have changed in the costume business since 
Theadora Van Runkle won an Oscar turning in-love criminals Bonnie and Clyde 
into a virtual Vogue layout. 
</P>
<P>
 Trend Watch: It can't be denied -- these two flaunt some mighty hip threads. 
He wears a fine leather motorcycle jacket and she dons two splendid fringed 
leather jackets, as well as of-the-moment hip huggers, crop tops and bra tops. 
</P>
<P>
 Sex Appeal: One of Hornung's biggest challenges was mitigating Harrelson's 
"healthy, blond, all-American" looks. Hence, the red glasses ("Ray-Bans are so 
Tom Cruise," he says) and sexy clothing. Several of Harrelson's shirts were 
made of mesh so that his nipples are slightly visible. Lots of effort went into 
making Harrelson's jeans look sexy. A tight fit and proper aging are what makes 
jeans alluring, Hornung explains. But you can't start out with new jeans since 
they won't instantly age well. "Half the thing that's sexy about jeans is how 
they conform to the contours of your body as they age -- the crotch becomes 
paler and the front of the thighs become paler," Hornung says. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Harrelson would need 10 look-alike pairs for the production, Hornung 
found vintage Levi's faded to more or less the same degree, then painted and 
overdyed them with subtle shades of gray in the crucial areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "I was mostly inspired by what was in fashion, but I wanted to do an 
homage to poor white trash elevated to a sexy fashion statement, kind of like 
rebel heroes," Hornung says. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources: Mickey's vintage Langlitz leather jacket is from Leathers & Treasures 
on Melrose, while his jeans are from various local vintage jean stores. Hornung 
designed his boots. Mallory's purple fringed leather jacket was custom-made by 
Leathers & Treasures. Most of the rest of her clothes were custom-made at 
Western Costume. TV reporter-cum-media scavenger Wayne Gale (Robert Downey Jr.) 
wears high-styled shapes and prints by Italian designer Gianni Versace.SIDNEY

O.C. POP BEAT: HELPING MAKE OFFSPRING A SMASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In judging Thom Wilson by his cover, there is only one question to resolve: Is 
this tall, lanky fellow merely a middle-aged Deadhead, or is he one of those 
poor souls who went to the original Woodstock and never quite made it back? 
</P>
<P>
 The beard is long and bushy, the hair wavy and graying. Grin marks frame the 
eyes. Furrows have been worn into the prominent forehead. The feet are 
sandaled, of course. Wrapped around his left wrist are strands of large, tan 
prayer beads that are not there just for effect but are part of his ritual as a 
Tibetan Buddhist. 
</P>
<P>
 As he sits on the tailgate of a sound truck on the Studio City television lot 
where he works, the only thing out of place in this vision of pure hippiedom is 
his T-shirt. "Offspring," it says, the name of the band that recently emerged 
as the biggest thing in punk rock. 
</P>
<P>
 What -- are all the tie-dyed shirts in the laundry? Has our 42-year-old 
borrowed these punker threads from a teen-age offspring of his own? Dad must be 
disappointed that the boy is into those loud, screaming hellions. Think of all 
the father-son bonding they could be doing on caravan with Jerry Garcia and the 
boys. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, if one bothers to converse with Wilson rather than just size him up 
by his looks, one quickly finds that he and his older boy, 16-year-old Tai, did 
go out on a rock 'n' roll tour this summer to do the father-son bonding thing. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't to follow the Dead, but to work with the Offspring. The band from 
Orange County invited Wilson along to mix its concerts, figuring that nobody 
knows better than he how the band ought to sound. Wilson has, after all, 
produced all three Offspring albums, including "Smash," the one that has 
astonished everybody by selling 1 million copies in four months, establishing 
the heretofore unknown group as the leader, with Green Day, of an unprecedented 
wave of commercial success for punk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I trust Thom more than anybody else," says Bryan Holland, the Offspring's 
singer and songwriter. "The whole band feels more confident with him back 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has a great deal of experience making punk bands sound good. In the 
early 1980s, he guided such important O.C. groups as the Adolescents, T.S.O.L. 
and the Vandals through recordings that have held up as punk rock standards. 
</P>
<P>
 None of those albums was a huge seller, punk historically having belonged to a 
hard-core cult rather than a mainstream audience. Among the cultists, though, 
were the four members of the Offspring, who went to a great deal of trouble to 
find Wilson in 1989, when they were unknown, untutored and about to make their 
first album. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, Wilson had abandoned record production and was making his living as a 
sound engineer for network television programs. Now that the Offspring are 
famous, Wilson's production work is all over radio and MTV and he thinks his 
days hanging around television studios may be numbered. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rule No. 1 of the music industry is "give the people what they want." At the 
moment, a lot of people suddenly are showing a preference for melodic punk 
rock, and producers with a knack for it are apt to be in demand for a while. 
Wilson (who cut the three Offspring albums for an aggregate sum of about 
$40,000) notes that he has just hired a manager to start fielding inquiries 
from bands and record companies that might want to hire him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's interesting to see how people rally around you when there's a platinum 
record," he says in his mild, unassuming way. "The Offspring record has really 
skewed the entire industry. I don't think people know what to make of it yet, 
but they think they want to get in on it." 
</P>
<P>
 Judging Wilson by his resume will lead you as far astray of the mark as 
judging him by his appearance. When he marshaled the Offspring last February 
for the final recording onslaught on "Smash," he had just come off a grueling 
series of all-nighters doing the final music mix for a Christmas television 
special by that mighty thrash-merchant, Perry Como. 
</P>
<P>
 After balancing tapes of the 81-year-old Mr. Mellow crooning songs for "Perry 
Como's Irish Christmas" backed by a 70-piece orchestra and a 300-voice choir, 
Wilson immediately was immersed in shout-along choruses, power chords and 
pummeling kick drums. Who says you gotta keep 'em separated? 
</P>
<P>
 The path that would lead Wilson to punk rock and Perry Como started in 1973 
when he dropped out of San Diego State, where he had been majoring in English, 
and moved to Los Angeles with friends who had come into some money and decided 
to build a recording studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson helped them build it, then stuck around to learn how to run it. His 
first important gig as an assistant engineer came in 1975 when he helped 
twiddle knobs and set up microphones during sessions for Boz Scaggs' "Silk 
Degrees," one of the biggest-selling albums of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 He had come to Los Angeles as just-plain Tom, and added the "h" to his first 
name in the mid-'70s after he started getting calls from creditors looking for 
Tom Wilson, the noted record producer who had helped Bob Dylan make his 
transition from pure folkie to electrified rocker, and who had launched Simon & 
Garfunkel by adding an electric band to their original acoustic recording of 
"The Sounds of Silence." 
</P>
<P>
 By 1980, Thom Wilson had engineered sessions with Barbra Streisand, Rufus and 
Ringo Starr and had served as the engineer at Dawnbreaker Studio, owned by the 
soft-pop duo Seals & Crofts. 
</P>
<P>
 He wanted to step up from engineering, essentially a technical job, to record 
production, which is the art of shepherding musicians through the entire 
process of choosing, arranging and performing their songs. Wilson accepted an 
assignment from the tiny Los Angeles label Bomp! and produced "Disconnected" by 
the late Stiv Bators, an aggressive garage rock album with both pop and punk 
influences. 
</P>
<P>
 Bomp! employee Lisa Fancher was starting her own label, Frontier Records, and 
had signed the Adolescents, a band from Fullerton, for their first album. But 
things weren't shaping up well, Fancher recalls, as a manager went AWOL with 
part of the band's recording budget. Wanting a seasoned hand in the studio to 
make sure the album moved along quickly, Fancher hired Wilson as engineer to 
work alongside musician Mike Patton, a mentor the Adolescents already had 
chosen as their producer. 
</P>
<P>
 As Fancher and Adolescents' guitarist Frank Agnew remember it, Wilson -- who 
says he had never listened to hard-core punk rock until then -- deserves most 
of the credit for getting "Adolescents," one of the best albums in O.C. rock 
history, on tape. But it wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thom was just thrown into the deep end," says Fancher. "You can imagine what 
the Adolescents were like, under 20, halfway drunk and pretty idiotic. Tony 
(Montana, the 18-year-old singer) turned the fire extinguisher on the (sound) 
board at one point when he wasn't being watched. One of them jimmied the 
pinball machine and took the change. Stupid punk moron stuff. (Wilson's) kind 
of a mellow guy, but at the end of the (first) day, he was just furious: 'I've 
never seen such unprofessional people.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson doesn't remember having said exactly that, but he does recall the three 
days of recording as fairly tumultuous. "Tony was a pretty angry, disenchanted 
human, kind of snarly and argumentative. They had micro fights between band 
members the whole time. It was really unbridled. I just sat and waited for it 
to pass. And probably noted the 'unprofessionalism' of it." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, as Fancher tells the story, the flustered Wilson listened to what 
the Ads had managed to commit to tape at the end of that unruly first day. 
"He'd taken some rough mixes home, and he'd seen the light. He'd gotten 
religion. I was dreading the next day. I thought he'd beat me up by the end of 
the project. But he came back saying, 'These songs are cool.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "He was older than us, that's all we knew: 'Oh man, here's this older guy,' " 
Agnew remembers. "We thought he'd be a bummer, but he wound up being really 
cool to hang around with. He knew the equipment inside out, he could get 
whatever sound you wanted, and he was easy to joke around with." 
</P>
<P>
 Fancher's next assignment for Wilson, also in 1981, was "Dance With Me," the 
first full-length album by T.S.O.L., a band of strapping surfers-turned-punkers 
who were known for wild, sometimes violent behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very apprehensive about it," Wilson says. "People said to me, 'Are you 
sure you want to do this? They beat people up.' But the first day I saw they 
were just people. Jack (Grisham) came in to do his vocals and just sat in a 
chair. I put his microphone up and we went through all the vocals. I was 
stunned by that. I'd never recorded anybody who was sitting down before. But if 
he wanted to sit down, let him sit down. I didn't know what to expect from 
these guys but they were calm, strictly business." 
</P>
<P>
 Things had grown less calm and businesslike by 1983. T.S.O.L., riven by 
internal tensions, worked with Wilson on a never-released album, aborted after 
Grisham flew into a fury and wrecked the studio's candy machine. 
</P>
<P>
 "The band was so self-destructive at that point it was ridiculous," Grisham 
says now. "Thom wasn't producing us at the time. He was baby-sitting. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing I like about Thom is he always made me feel real confident," 
Grisham adds, recalling more productive sessions with Wilson. "A thing people 
don't understand about punk rock is that it's about having fun and not 
following any set rules about doing things. Thom fit right in with us the 
minute he got there. He was willing to not let us be structured." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Wilson's expertise and T.S.O.L.'s amateurism, Grisham says Wilson 
never talked down to or tried to lord it over his inexperienced punk charges. 
"If he had done that, it would have been '(expletive) you, you Seals & 
Crofts-mixing piece of (expletive).' He'd always say, 'Go ahead and let's see 
what happens.' I've had (producers) since then that didn't have half the 
talent, jumping up and down" because of Grisham's unorthodox approaches. "He's 
so confident in himself that he can let other people be themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson says he never had any blow-ups with the sometimes-volatile punk rockers 
he worked with, even though age and background did make him an outsider. 
</P>
<P>
 "It never was an issue for me, and it never seemed to bother them. I tried to 
keep it not as a cultural thing, but as a venture in record-making. There's a 
kind of mystique in the recording studio that breaks down a lot of the barriers 
you run into in other places. There were a few trust issues at first. It was 
usually microscopic." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's work with T.S.O.L. (two albums and an EP) led him to their proteges, 
the Vandals, for whom he also produced two albums and an EP. He also produced 
China White and the Dead Kennedys and a solo record by Adolescents alumnus Rikk 
Agnew. 
</P>
<P>
 But he kept his hand in mainstream pop. In contrast to the Vandals' EP "Peace 
Through Vandalism," which was recorded in a single night, he spent long months 
in 1983 engineering Michael Sembello's slick soundtrack for "Flashdance," 
including its No. 1 hit "Maniac." He also was the engineer for a session by a 
still little-known Madonna as she recorded "Crazy for You," which later would 
emerge as a No. 1 hit from the "Vision Quest" film soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Wilson says, "the projects started drying up a bit," and in 1987 he 
crossed over to television. A job doing sound production for musical guests' 
performances on "The Joan Rivers Show" led to sound engineering work on a 
variety of specials and network series including five seasons of "A Different 
World," two of "Roseanne" (Wilson says he became friendly with the star and 
attended her wedding to Tom Arnold) and his current gig, "Grace Under Fire." 
</P>
<P>
 By 1989, when the Offspring found him, Wilson considered himself out of record 
production. Holland, the Offspring singer, recalls a long, difficult search 
that finally paid off just as the band was about to hire another producer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was flattered," Wilson says with a grin. "And they hit me on a hiatus, when 
there wasn't much going on" in his television work schedule. "I thought it was 
very weird that somebody wanted to make a punk rock record in 1989." 
</P>
<P>
 The Offspring's co-founder, bassist Greg Kriesel, remembers that Wilson had to 
coach the band on some rudiments of rock performance: "He taught me I'm 
supposed to be playing with the kick drum, and I was thinking, 'Oh, really?' 
There were a lot of things we didn't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Holland and Kriesel say that Wilson helped the band strip down its sound, 
simplifying drum and bass patterns, tossing out unneeded guitar solos. By the 
time they had completed "The Offspring" (1990) and "Ignition" (1992) with 
Wilson, the band members were beginning to think of him as a sort of creative 
conscience, asking themselves "what Thom would have to say" as they rehearsed 
material for "Smash." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've kind of gone back and forth ever since the first record," says Holland. 
"He'd point things out to improve it, and we'd take it to heart, go back, write 
another record and refine it as we go along. We're really in sync about making 
records. We've been fortunate that Thom and we get along very well." 
</P>
<P>
 "I can be real stubborn when we get in the thick of it, although it's always 
been very polite," Wilson says. "Usually after I work with people a while, they 
realize what I say isn't personal. That's probably the reason we've kept 
working together. They've been very flexible and determined, and they trusted 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 He and the two Offspring founders cite only one instance where the band 
ultimately went against his advice. Wilson was unimpressed when he heard the 
preliminary instrumental track to "Self Esteem," the song that since has 
emerged as the second video from "Smash." 
</P>
<P>
 "He felt it was boring the way it was," says Holland. "He said it made him 
feel like going out and ordering a pizza." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's advice was to change the bass line, but Holland says he and Kriesel 
"felt the bass line was an important hook in the song the way it was" and held 
fast. "By the time we got the vocals laid down," Holland notes, "(Wilson) 
thought it was a good song." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has done much thinking about how music should be played -- he dots his 
discourse with theoretical phrases like "aesthetic template" -- and very little 
actual playing. "I'm not a musician," he says. "I sort of play guitar. Nobody 
would be impressed by it. I sing when I'm alone in the car." 
</P>
<P>
 Everything he taught the Offspring stems, he says, from his philosophy of 
recording and song-arrangement: "It's the carrot in front of the donkey, the 
donkey being the listener, and the carrot being whatever you have at the moment 
to keep the donkey's interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no statutory requirements for people to listen to records. You have 
to entice them. Everything in the record has to have a reason for being there, 
and you weed things out that are distracting or take away from the flow. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a fine line where ultimately they are the artists' records, and I see 
myself as a collaborative artist working with them to bring out the essence of 
what they're doing. But I'm also an advocate for the listener. I speak up for 
the listener, and steer things in a way that's going to make it accessible to 
the listener." 
</P>
<P>
 On "Smash," the results of that philosophy are often thrilling. 
</P>
<P>
 The recording avoids the stereotypical grind and slab-like density of many 
punk and hard-rock albums. Often, sections of the band will drop out, leaving 
just a single naked element (Holland sings one verse of "Bad Habit" a cappella, 
for instance). Sometimes, a hole of silence is punched into a song for dramatic 
effect. Many songs contain passages that gather force by increments, perhaps 
beginning with just a beat, then a scraping guitar riff, then an accelerating 
drum pulse, joined a moment later by a momentum-filled bass line. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of stampeding the listener by coming on all in a rush, the Offspring 
give you the pleasure of watching inevitability in motion. When the rush comes, 
you've seen it approaching, and the anticipation makes it that much more 
satisfying when it arrives. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing neither Wilson nor the band saw coming was a platinum record. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that material-wise, we had a lot to work with," says Wilson. "I knew 
it was going to be a relatively hot record when we cut 'Gotta Get Away' (though 
he adds that he wasn't excited by what proved to be the breakthrough hit, "Come 
Out and Play," until the band worked in the spoken hook, "you gotta keep 'em 
separated," late in the recording process). 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them, 'This is going to be the biggest-selling record Epitaph (the 
independent company that markets the Offspring) ever had, and they thought I 
was full of (expletive). I told them it would sell at least 150,000 (a total 
that, as recently as April, was a benchmark for a major punk hit). They thought 
I was nuts." 
</P>
<P>
 Now everybody knows better. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson thinks punk's rise has to do with the nation's nervousness in the face 
of perceived social decay and economic decline. "I think punks are generally 
well-meaning, intelligent people who are failed idealists. In the '80s, you had 
all these (punk) songs about where the culture was screwing up, and nobody 
wanted to listen because of the big sleep of the Reagan era. Now the industry 
and people have caught up. Things have gotten dire enough so that the issues 
punk rock addresses are viable with the general public." 
</P>
<P>
 If his analysis is right, what's dire for America may prove beneficial to his 
own bank account. He is anticipating plenty of work, figuring that the music 
industry will rush to punk the way it rushed to grunge bands in the late '80s 
and early '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The recording projects are starting to show up. I'm kind of sought-after. 
I've kind of run my course with (television) for a while. I may come back to 
it, but right now it's kind of flat for me. Doing sound in television is not a 
very respected thing. Sound is an afterthought of television. 
</P>
<P>
 "The game plan is, given the right sequence of events, I can make enough money 
in the next couple of years so the lifestyle will be our choice," adds Wilson, 
who lives near Santa Cruz with his wife, Margo, and sons Tai and Montgomery, 
who is 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to mutate, but punk rock has been revitalized or reborn, and it's 
been discovered by the populace. There's an honesty to the music that, when 
it's done well, is very enjoyable. I don't think it's going to run its course."

FAMILY FILMS ABOUND, BUT SUCCESSES DON'T; MOVIES: STUDIOS ROLL OUT WHOLESOME 
FILMS TO SATISFY THE BOOMER CROWD. BUT EXCEPT FOR TWO SPIELBERG PRODUCTIONS, 
THE ONLY OTHER HITS HAVE BEEN DISNEY'S 'LION KING' AND 'ANGELS.' 
</P>

<P>
 As sure as fall follows summer, the breakaway success of films such as "Home 
Alone," "Aladdin" and "Free Willy" was bound to perpetrate a rush of family 
film projects. And any time Hollywood goes for the gold, there are bound to be 
contestants that finish dead last. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past two years, virtually every major studio has cranked a 
live-action or animated project into production, hoping to satisfy the demands 
of BWKs (boomers with kids) by presenting wholesome, no-violence, no-sex 
entertainment. The kinds of movies, a new generation of parents said, that are 
suitable for the entire family. 
</P>
<P>
 The demand seemed to make economic sense too. The prospect of appealing to an 
8-to-80 demographic, ranging from children to grandparents, spurred studios 
such as Fox and Warners to institute family film divisions. Visions of 
limitless synergistic possibilities danced in the heads of studio/theme park 
conglomerates such as Disney and Universal, who envisioned this year's family 
film hit as next year's amusement ride, live ice-skating show or maybe even a 
Broadway musical. 
</P>
<P>
 Family films became the next sure thing. The industry joke, says one studio 
executive, was that hit films could be created simply by phoning Steven 
Spielberg's mother and asking what his favorite TV shows were as a kid. 
(Spielberg's company, Amblin, produced the successful family film hits "The 
Flintstones" and "Little Rascals," released by Universal.) 
</P>
<P>
 Well, "surprise, surprise, surprise," says Disney Studios motion pictures 
President David Hoberman. All family films are not created equal. Just because 
last year's films "The Sandlot" and "Rookie of the Year" were hits, it didn't 
guarantee that parents would drag their kids to Columbia's "Little Big League" 
this summer. In the "Home Alone" series, Macaulay Culkin got plenty of laughs 
from clobbering clumsy thieves. But it didn't mean audiences would split their 
sides when he turned the tables on his larcenous father in this summer's MGM 
film "Getting Even With Dad." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other recent family film flops were "Baby's Day Out," "North," 
"Lassie" and "Black Beauty." In fact, except for Universal's two Spielberg 
productions, the only other family films that scored were from Disney -- "The 
Lion King" and "Angels in the Outfield." The upside on family films is 
impressive, according to one studio senior executive, including endless 
merchandising and sequel possibilities. "But when they don't work, they don't 
work at all." 
</P>
<P>
 "Little Big League," "Baby's Day Out" and "Getting Even With Dad" grossed well 
under $20 million. "North," "Lassie" and "Black Beauty" haven't even cracked 
$10 million. Although these films are supposed to cost less because they rarely 
include stars, "Baby's Day Out" and "North" reportedly came in at about $50 
million and $40 million, respectively. Even on a more modestly budgeted 
$20-million film such as "Little Big League," when family films lose, they lose 
it all. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike action films, if a family-entertainment film fails in the United 
States, it has virtually no chance of being a hit overseas. And you have to add 
on marketing costs, says the senior studio executive. "If you have a film that 
reaches different audience segments, you have to advertise to all of them. And 
that can get to be very expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The audience's preference in family films is just as exacting and ahead of the 
Hollywood learning curve as it is for all kinds of movies, industry executives 
have discovered. Family entertainments are a bit of a trap, says outgoing 
Imagine Films production head David Friendly. "They look easy to create on the 
surface, but you have to apply the same rigorous standards, maybe even more 
rigorous, than with any other film." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney, perhaps more than any single studio, has a franchise of creating 
palatable entertainment for the whole family. Even so, it has to keep one step 
ahead of its audience at all times, Hoberman says. "Kids still want something 
they haven't seen before. They don't want to be taken for granted." 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the studio's Christmas release "The Jungle Book" is a live-action 
adventure version of a venerable classic that worked so well for the studio in 
animated form. This time it will have the additional elements of a young adult 
(Jason Scott Lee), real animals and a love interest. Another variant will be 
its upcoming John Hughes production "The Bee," which combines the mayhem of the 
filmmaker's "Home Alone" movies with some of the fantastical components of 
"Honey, I Shrunk the Kids." 
</P>
<P>
 A major problem has been Hollywood's proclivity to see the forest rather than 
the trees. The success of "Home Alone" was interpreted as a desire for kids to 
witness empowerment fantasies, where they get to function as, or outwit, 
adults. 
</P>
<P>
 But in translating that concept to the screen, there have been several serious 
miscalculations. Under the guise of "family entertainment," a number of rather 
callous films with increasingly far-fetched premises were produced, says New 
York Daily News film critic David Kehr. A prime example is "Blank Check," which 
he regards as a "grubby empowerment fantasy" in which a young boy receives a 
blank check and goes on a consumer spending spree and even winds up chasing a 
girl "like Frank Sinatra in a '50s movie," Kehr says. As with any genre, the 
more hackneyed family entertainments were doomed to failure. "Baby's Day Out," 
regarded as "Home Alone" with a baby, was such a misstep, says a Fox source. 
Not only did parents not see the jeopardy in the film or think it funny, but 
kids are not interested in infants. 
</P>
<P>
 But what of the films that received some positive critical response -- like 
"Black Beauty" and "Little Big League" -- and still failed to find an audience? 
In part, says the senior executive, that's due to a confluence of events. Both 
films arrived at a time when the market was flooded with similar fare -- 
especially the dominant "Lion King," the biggest moneymaker since "Jurassic 
Park." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, in creating these films, the studios may not have taken into account 
that parents still decide what films their children see. Even a poorly reviewed 
family film like "The Flintstones" drew a large audience because parents 
recognized it from the TV series. "When marketing a kids' movie," says one 
studio chief, "you're really trying to bring in the adults who either accompany 
their kids or make the decisions on what they see." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Times Film Critic Kenneth Turan remarked on a certain 
schizophrenia operating on the part of adults. "It's like when they complain 
there are no good adult films around. And when I ask them if they've seen 'Eat 
Drink Man Woman' or 'Barcelona,' they say no. But they have seen 'Forrest Gump' 
and 'The Client' -- the same movies as everyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, with family films, parents want to see what's hot. They'll go to 
"The Lion King" over and over, rather than take a chance on "Black Beauty." "A 
lot of it is just lip service," Turan says. "What parents want is a twofer, an 
adult film that won't horrify their kids. Like 'The Mask.' "

THE BERGMAN TOUCH, FROM FATHER TO SON; MOVIES: 'SUNDAY'S CHILDREN' EXPLORES A 
BOY'S RELATIONSHIP WITH HIS FATHER, A RELATIONSHIP DEEPLY ROOTED IN REALITY: 
INGMAR WROTE IT, SON DANIEL DIRECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE LACHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Their relationship essentially began with that briefest of pleasures, the 
Swedish summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Summers were the time Ingmar Bergman and his son Daniel would renew their 
relationship, which had ruptured when Daniel was 3 and his distinguished 
director father had moved on to other familial pastures. 
</P>
<P>
 From the age of 8 on, Daniel summered with his father. So it was fitting that 
it should have been summer when, nearly 20 years later, they decided to make 
their first film together. 
</P>
<P>
 That film, "Sunday's Children," directed by Daniel and written by Ingmar about 
his painful relationship with his own father, is also about a summer day. The 
centerpiece of the film, which opens in Los Angeles Friday, is a bicycle trip 
young Ingmar took with his father in 1926, but the film also examines his 
parents' volatile marriage and the mythologies of youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was five years ago one summer that both my father and I were working on 
different projects," the younger Bergman said by phone from his island home in 
Stockholm. "We were working in different parts of (Ingmar's) house on Faro, and 
we had lunch together every day. We talked a lot about different projects, and 
we were both a little bored with what we were doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "And he had the idea that there might be a film in the (1987 autobiography) he 
wrote, 'The Magic Lantern.' I suggested that the bicycle story might be a film, 
and he asked if I would be interested in directing if he made a script. I think 
within one hour, we decided to do it. The summer after, he wrote the script. 
The summer after that, I directed it." 
</P>
<P>
 The critically acclaimed film, which has been circling the globe and playing 
the festival circuit for two years, explores the origins of Ingmar's difficult 
relationship with his remote, sometimes raging pastor father. But "Sunday's 
Children" also views those complexities with compassion. The father's love 
stitches the film together as it shuttles between Ingmar's childhood and middle 
age. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Ingmar blessed his son with a masterful screenplay to brace Daniel's 
first full-length feature, made with a modest budget of $3 million. (Ingmar, 
75, retired from directing 10 years ago.) 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a loving gesture," said Daniel, 31. "He writes about his father and he 
gives it to his son to direct, and I give it back to him as a final film." 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel accepted the baton with conditions: Ingmar was not to step foot on the 
set, and when they did talk during filming, it was over the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't have two directors on the same set," he said. "It's really 
dangerous, especially when we're so emotionally involved in the story. It would 
confuse the actors. It would confuse me. It would confuse everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, "Sunday's Children" has all the richness and delicacy you would expect 
of the elder Bergman's films. Critics consider it the continuation of a trilogy 
that includes "Fanny and Alexander" (1982) and "The Best Intentions" (1992) -- 
both films written by Bergman that also dissected his family's intricate 
relationships. "Sunday's Children" has won prizes at film festivals in 
Montreal, Puerto Rico and Giffoni, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel says he realizes that comparisons with his father's work are inevitable 
but he's nonetheless leery of them. Although he ultimately decided to 
collaborate with Ingmar, he avoided both directing and the consequent 
comparisons for his first 10 years in the business, working instead as a grip 
and film technician. Now he says he has come to terms with his artistic 
inheritance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I can avoid being Ingmar's son, and that's not something to 
avoid. Why should I avoid it? This is a story I wanted to do, and it's 
something I know about. It's about my own family. It's about my own flesh and 
blood. It's about things I have experienced. It was written by one of the 
world's best scriptwriters, who is my father, and that shouldn't make me avoid 
doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel, the first of Bergman's nine children to make a film, is reluctant to 
discuss the dynamics of his relationship with his father. But he does say 
making "Sunday's Children" enhanced their bond. 
</P>
<P>
 "We became closer to each other," he said. "I understood a lot about him, and 
he, maybe seeing how I interpreted his script, understood how I feel about 
those things and how I am as a person." 
</P>
<P>
 Such insights were not always so accessible. Daniel's mother was the esteemed 
Estonian concert pianist Kabi Laretei, whose career demanded constant travel, 
prodding her son into precocious independence. By the time Daniel was 3 and his 
parents had divorced, Bergman was involved with actress Liv Ullmann. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Ingmar's return into his life, 5-year-old Daniel became a captive 
of the local cinema. In a real-life scenario reminiscent of "Cinema Paradiso," 
he bonded with and learned from the older man who ran it. Daniel began working 
as a projectionist in a Stockholm cinema at 12, and in 1987, he made a 
television documentary about his mentor, "Nypan." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was almost like a father to me. And also there was a key grip who I worked 
with as a trainee and who became a close friend. I really had different fathers 
in my life, one can say." 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel continued his self-education when he began spending summers with 
Ingmar, studying his 200-film collection of such 16-mm classics as Fritz Lang's 
"Metropolis" and Francois Truffaut's "The 400 Blows." 
</P>
<P>
 But conventional education bored him. He dropped out of school at 14 and moved 
swiftly from projectionist to film crew. In that capacity, he worked on his 
father's films "The Magic Flute," "Fanny and Alexander" and "Autumn Sonata." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, Daniel moved into directing short films and television. His first 
film, "Perception," about a woman who represses the memory of a rape and is 
later haunted by it, was entered in the Berlin Film Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 He's now making commercials, sifting through Hollywood screenplays, and 
working on his own script based on an Icelandic novel that he's loath to talk 
about. "It's really too vulnerable, still." 
</P>
<P>
 When Daniel settles on his next project, though, it will likely recast the 
meaning of the words a Bergman film . "I have never found any major influence," 
he said. "I've grown up with so many films, and I've lived my life, which has 
been quite dramatic. And I'm influenced by my father and my mother and by 
everybody, and by my ex-girlfriends. One gets so influenced by everything."

'M.A.N.T.I.S.' UNDERGOES PILOT-TO-SERIES CHANGES; NEW PRODUCERS OF TV SERIES 
ABOUT AN AFRICAN AMERICAN SUPER-HERO CITE CREATIVE REASONS; OTHERS CLAIM RACISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even in the highly competitive universe of the super-hero, the new 
crime-fighter on the block -- the one they call M.A.N.T.I.S. -- would seem to 
have quite a few things going for him. 
</P>
<P>
 M.A.N.T.I.S. has the power to run with lightning speed, to leap over pursuing 
cars and to toss criminals through the air as if they were soccer balls. One of 
his main weapons is a high-tech vehicle that can fly and go underwater. 
</P>
<P>
 M.A.N.T.I.S. is also a rarity in the super-hero world: an African American. 
Unlike other black super-heroes such as Meteor Man or Blankman, M.A.N.T.I.S. 
takes crime-fighting seriously. He is the alter ego of Dr. Miles Hawkins, a 
brilliant biophysicist who was paralyzed after being struck by a bullet during 
an urban riot while saving a young boy, then helped develop an exoskeleton that 
would enable him to get out of his wheelchair -- the Mechanically Augmented 
Neuro-Transmitter Interactive System. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with all these qualifications, there are those who say that they are 
bugged by "M.A.N.T.I.S.," the drama series premiering on Fox at 8 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A newly formed media watchdog group and an actor and actress featured in the 
series pilot that aired in January have leveled charges of racism against the 
show's new producers, complaining that the ethnic makeup of the cast was 
reduced and the tone of the series was radically changed from the pilot to 
de-emphasize the African American flavor and attract more white viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in the community really had their hopes invested in the series, and 
now I'm getting calls from people who say they feel a sense of betrayal that so 
much has changed," said Eddie Wong, head of the Rainbow Coalition's 2-month-old 
Commission on Fairness in the Media. "It was a show that showed African 
Americans working together. The reasons why they changed it is not acceptable 
to us." 
</P>
<P>
 The charges have been vehemently denied by the new producers and network 
executives, who said the changes from pilot to series were made strictly for 
creative reasons -- to increase the story possibilities and to make the show 
flashier. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not have taken the job if I had been told that I had to whiten the 
show up. That is ridiculous," said Bryce Zabel, who with James McAdams took 
over the reins from the original executive producers, Sam Hamm, Sam Raimi and 
Rob Tapert, after the series was ordered. "There was never any direction (from 
Fox) to cast a new character as black or white. The pilot was a fine piece of 
entertainment, but we need to make changes in order to create a franchise. It's 
frustrating that people think otherwise." 
</P>
<P>
 In the "M.A.N.T.I.S." pilot, Hawkins (Carl Lumbly) was assisted by two young 
African students with heavy accents dressed in traditional garb (Christopher M. 
Brown and Wendy Raquel Robinson). Also featured were two other black 
characters: a female assistant coroner (Gina Torres) and a cocky television 
reporter (Bobby Hosea). 
</P>
<P>
 All four of those supporting characters were axed from the series, replaced by 
three new characters, two of them white: John Stonebrake (Roger Rees), Hawkins' 
best friend and a quirky British scientist who comes up with gadgets for 
M.A.N.T.I.S.; a young bike courier (Christopher Gartin) who also assists 
M.A.N.T.I.S., and a black police lieutenant (Galyn Gorg) who slowly becomes 
romantically involved with Hawkins while simultaneously accelerating her quest 
to hunt down M.A.N.T.I.S., considered by police to be a vigilante. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot was set in Ocean City, a fictional but gritty, largely African 
American community populated by many black professionals as well as gang 
members and white bigots. The script was loaded with urban slang and racial 
references. 
</P>
<P>
 The racial references are all but gone from the first episodes of the series, 
and M.A.N.T.I.S. now operates in the multicultural environment of the fictional 
West Coast city of Port Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought the pilot was too grim and too realistic," said Bob Greenblatt, 
senior vice president of drama series development at Fox. "We wanted to bring 
out the fantasy element in the story. We didn't want to do episodes about the 
human condition every week." 
</P>
<P>
 He added, "There were lots of problems creatively with the pilot. There were 
holes and inconsistencies in the story, and there were a lot of problems with 
the characters and the actors. We were never happy with the way the African 
students were rendered. We also felt they didn't really provide a way to bring 
stories to M.A.N.T.I.S." 
</P>
<P>
 Lumbly, who stars as Hawkins/M.A.N.T.I.S., said he was concerned when he 
learned that Hamm and Raimi, who wrote the two-hour pilot, were being replaced 
and that cast changes were being made. 
</P>
<P>
 "Based on my own experience, I thought it must have something to do with 
color. I would be lying if I didn't say that didn't come into my mind," he 
said. "I was told there was not a mandate from the studio, but that Bryce felt 
that the placement of some of the regulars made it difficult to evolve the 
show. They did not serve 'M.A.N.T.I.S.' as a series. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of that said, it was still disappointing," Lumbly said. "But as we have 
moved into the series, I am very hopeful. Much of the feeling that was stated 
in the pilot -- what my character has stood for -- has remained intact. The 
lighter tone in the initial episodes is not something that will affect this 
world. We will stay realistic -- in fact, in some instances, even more so than 
the pilot." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the actors who were replaced aren't so certain. "I felt we were doing 
something really unique in the pilot, something groundbreaking," Torres said. 
"It was important to create relationships that appealed not only to cartoon and 
comic-book lovers, but spoke to another generation that didn't have a black 
super-hero when they were growing up." 
</P>
<P>
 She added: "The high ratings of the pilot say to me that the formula worked. 
The audience responded to the characters and concept. To strip it, literally to 
change the bones of it, negates what was there in the first place." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, in a recent interview in the Wall Street Journal, said, "It's a slap in 
the face to the audience. The network will say that M.A.N.T.I.S. is still 
black, but that's not the issue. There were all these black people who were 
helping him do it. Those messages were almost as important as the character 
M.A.N.T.I.S." (When asked for further elaboration by The Times, Brown, through 
a spokesman, declined to comment.) 
</P>
<P>
 "M.A.N.T.I.S." creators Hamm and Raimi don't want to discuss the alterations. 
Though they still appear in the credits as executive producers, they are not 
involved with the series. In a cryptic statement to the press, they never 
referred to the specific reasons why they left the series, saying only that the 
pilot "represents the vision of the creators" and that due "in part" to prior 
commitments, they "felt strongly" that they "would be unable to contribute the 
creative oversight the series deserved." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the casting of the new character Stonebrake, Greenblatt and Zabel said 
they were simply looking for the best actor, with no regard for color. "We were 
looking at all ethnicities," Greenblatt said. "We tested Richard Roundtree and 
Paul Winfield, but they were not right for the part." 
</P>
<P>
 Torres' coroner character was eliminated because they didn't want to have a 
death every week, he said, but Hosea's reporter character may return in future 
episodes. 
</P>
<P>
 Zabel said that the new "M.A.N.T.I.S." would ultimately be more realistic than 
the pilot: "What makes this series work is still intact. Only now, he will be 
in a multicultural world, which is what we live in."

BLENDING PAST AND PRESENT INTO B SHARP FOCUS; JAZZ: ALL MEMBERS OF THE QUARTET 
WRITE WIDE-RANGING MATERIAL THAT THEY BELIEVE PUSHES THE GROUP INTO A NEW 
REALM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Don't let the name the B Sharp Jazz Quartet deceive you. The moniker may 
conjure up images of a band like the Modern Jazz Quartet, its members looking 
splendid in sleek tuxedos, their music cool and to the point, but those images 
would be off the mark. 
</P>
<P>
 This band offers sharp compositions -- from straight-ahead to avant-garde to 
hip-hop -- that go where you least expect them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not mainstream, we're not traditional, we're not contemporary," says B 
Sharp's leader, drummer Herb Graham Jr., who feels that his band's wide-ranging 
approach takes the group beyond the jazz realm. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we play is alternative improvisational music," says Graham. "What we are 
doing with this quartet is taking the music from the past, and embracing that, 
and also playing the music from the future, and embracing that ." 
</P>
<P>
 And while much of the talk these days about young jazz groups from Los Angeles 
is centered around the formidable Black/Note Quintet, B Sharp also deserves its 
share of respect. 
</P>
<P>
 The band's fine self-titled debut album (Review, F3) on Mama Foundation 
Records is generating both critical acclaim and nationwide airplay. Its 
scintillating performances, mostly in Southern California, have attracted a 
loyal coterie of fans. The group plays Friday at the Hyatt Newporter in Newport 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 One way B Sharp gets its distinctive sound is by offering original material 
almost exclusively. To this end, as Art Blakey did for decades, Graham demands 
that the members of the group write, and the band's CD documents the players' 
varying styles. 
</P>
<P>
 On B Sharp's album, Graham's " 'T' Thyme" has a Latin groove, while 
saxophonist Randall Willis' "Almost Next" is a post-bop blues that swings. 
"Analytical Cubism," from bassist Reginald Carson, sways between an edgy yet 
foot-tapping section and one that's riotously fast, and pianist Eliot Douglass' 
"Ballad" is simple and pretty. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted a record that had all the flavors, from hard core to funky, from 
thesofter to the abstract," says Graham. "We wanted to give everybody something 
to listen to." 
</P>
<P>
 And there's lots more waiting to be recorded, says Doug Evans, general manager 
of the nonprofit Mama Foundation, which signed B Sharp to a deal for one album 
with an option for another. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's at least enough material to make four more albums," says Evans. "Iwas 
very impressed with the quality of the compositions." 
</P>
<P>
 Graham says the origins of the band's name can be traced to the zesty tune "D 
Flat Waltz," which keyboardist Joe Zawinul wrote in the '70s for his band, 
Weather Report. That name sparked him to come up with the "B Sharp" handle. 
</P>
<P>
 "The words seemed to describe not only a musical group, but expressed 
something about a kind of lifestyle vibe," he says. "It sounded elegant, and I 
wanted the words Jazz Quartet in there, in case we're together for 40 years, 
like the Modern Jazz Quartet." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The seeds for B Sharp were planted when Graham formed a guitar-bass-drums trio 
in 1988. But despite many gigs in the world of rock and pop -- Graham has 
played with such bands as the Supremes, the Watts Prophets and Queen Latifah -- 
he'd always wanted to form an acoustic jazz quartet. 
</P>
<P>
 That goal came alive when he met Willis, a saxophone soloist who is both 
intrepid and commanding, on an alternative-rock gig in 1988 and the pair 
started playing duos in the drummer's loft apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham met Douglass on a tour of Japan with the Supremes in 1989 and invited 
him to join B Sharp. The group was complete when Carson, a former baritone 
saxophonist who turned to bass in his early 20s -- joined up. 
</P>
<P>
 The group made its debut in May, 1990, after rehearsing for a month or two at 
the World Stage, the Los Angeles music showcase co-founded by drummer Billy 
Higgins and poet Kamau Da'aood. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the subsequent four years, B Sharp's intriguing, diverse style was heard at 
such L.A-area venues as 5th Street Dick's, the Atlas Bar & Grill, the Jazz 
Bakery and the UCLA Jazz Festival, Jazz at Drew, and the International 
Association of Jazz Appreciation's tribute to Billy Higgins. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's performances have made an impact on both musicians and fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always impressed by their presentation, by how tight they were," says 
Willie Jones III, drummer for Black/Note, who has been listening to B Sharp 
since its inception. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought they were terrific, one of the best young bands I've heard," says 
Darlene Chan, associate producer of the Playboy Jazz Festival, commenting on B 
Sharp's set at a pre-Playboy concert she booked in June at Santa Monica 
College. "You could tell they worked together, that they're a unit. It's not 
like, 'Hey, let's just go play this gig.' Their repertoire is very thought 
out." 
</P>
<P>
 The band faces a new challenge this month when it takes its music to the East 
Coast for a series of dates next month. Graham sees these performances not only 
as an opportunity to gain a new audience, but also as a way of proving to fans 
and players in the East that West Coast bands like his, and Black/Note, are 
first-rate ensembles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're playing just as intense as anybody," says Graham. "So we're going to 
walk right into the teeth of the lion and see what's up. We don't care if we 
get cheered or booed." 
</P>
<P>
 Graham thinks B Sharp should be included on non-jazz concerts, too. In this 
way, he feels, that jazz -- and, specifically, B Sharp -- can overcome what he 
says is a compartmentalization that limits the band's exposure and, as a 
result, album sales. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want B Sharp to play on some alternative-music concerts, say with the 
Eurythmics or Stone Temple Pilots," he says. "If you let people listen to jazz 
as much as you let them listen to other music, jazz would be just as popular." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And the fact that B Sharp's members have played with many non-jazz bands also 
helps to give the group wider appeal, Graham says. "When we play for young 
people and they ask, 'Well, who have you played with?' and we name Queen 
Latifah or Freestyle Fellowship, they go, 'Oh, cool' and they listen to the 
jazz music we play," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whereas if I say I've played with James Moody or Don Cherry, they're gonna 
go, 'Huh?' So if they know the people we've played with, it brings them in." 
</P>
<P>
 * The B Sharp Jazz Quartet and keyboardist Bobby Lyle play Friday at the Hyatt 
Newporter, 1107 Jamboree Road, Newport Beach. 7:30 p.m. $15. (714) 729-1234.

L.A.'S 2ND COUNTRY-MUSIC STATION TO JOIN LINEUP SEPT. 10 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAUDIA PUIG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mirroring a growing national trend, a second country-music station will emerge 
on the Los Angeles radio dial next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Country music last year became the most popular radio format in the United 
States, but Los Angeles has had only one such station, KZLA-FM (93.9), since 
KLAC-AM switched to a different format last December. 
</P>
<P>
 The new station, which debuts Sept. 10, will simulcast with an existing 
country outlet, KIKF-FM (94.3), Orange County's top-rated station.  
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles station, formerly known as KMGX-FM and owned by Buckley 
Communications, was sold this week to Chagal Communications, which has entered 
into an agreement allowing Astor Broadcasting, which owns KIKF, to provide its 
programming. 
</P>
<P>
 Both stations are located at 94.3 on the dial and, through this agreement, 
will synchronize their signals and become one station that will reach listeners 
from Santa Clarita to San Clemente, said Art Astor, KIKF's owner and general 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at KZLA, which ranked 12th in the most recent Arbitron ratings, 
predicted that the new station will be a boon for the growing number of 
country-music fans. During 1993, 10 million new listeners tuned in to country 
stations around the country, according to Simmons Study of Media and Markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time a competitive battle opens up in the market, the winner is the 
people who love country music -- the listeners," said R.J. Curtis, KZLA's 
program director. 
</P>
<P>
 KIKF's Astor said that his station, which plays mostly "hot" country artists 
such as Garth Brooks, Clint Black, Alan Jackson and Reba McEntire, will attempt 
to differentiate itself from KZLA by having a more "folksy" approach.

ANNOUNCER MISSES CALL OF THE BIG LEAGUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MILTON KENT, THE BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The events, or rather the non-events, of the past 14 days have turned Jon 
Miller into a grumpy not-very-old man. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, you see, is a major-league baseball announcer, one of the best in the 
business, when there is business. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's the rub. For the past 14 days, the baseball strike has made 
Miller's life very simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, let's see. I take my kids to the movies, read some books, watch some 
videos, talk on the phone, where I holler about the owners, then I hang up, 
read another book and take a nap. That's an ideal life, eh?" said Miller, who 
announces Baltimore Orioles games. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't believe it for a moment. With all due respect to his wife and kids, 
there's no place Jon Miller would rather be at this time of year than a 
ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Miller, 43, has received a bit of a baseball fix from his other job, 
play-by-play man for ESPN's "Sunday Night Baseball," with the network having 
done one minor-league game and planning to do another Sunday, both involving 
the double-A Birmingham Barons, who include a certain former basketball player 
you might have heard of. 
</P>
<P>
 But he'd rather be in the bigs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It (the strike) is kind of disappointing," Miller said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great season with some great things happening. You had the potential 
to see some players do things that had not been done since fellows like Ruth, 
Gehrig, Williams and DiMaggio, the icons of the game, had done them." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the books Miller has been reading is "Lords of the Realm," authored by 
Wall Street Journal reporter John Helyar, which chronicles the history of 
baseball labor negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 It should then come as no surprise to learn that Miller's sympathies in the 
current strike lie with the players. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does (Yankees owner) George Steinbrenner believe Bud Selig (the Milwaukee 
owner and de facto commissioner) when Bud says the small-market teams are in 
desperate trouble? If so, why isn't George Steinbrenner, as a fellow owner, 
willing to help?" said Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 In Miller's opinion, which sounds a lot like that of the Major League Baseball 
Players Assn., the owners forced the players into this strike by presenting a 
salary cap proposal that they knew would not be accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The owners) had to know what the response from the players would be," Miller 
said. "That leaves only one conclusion: They wanted the players to strike." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller believes, as the players do, that the owners can resolve whatever 
financial hardships they are in by redistributing wealth among themselves, 
without asking the players to give up hard-won gains. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller says the bigger teams, like the Dodgers, New York Yankees and Toronto 
Blue Jays, for example, should agree to place a percentage of their local 
broadcast dollars into a central fund -- where national TV and radio dollars 
are placed and disbursed at the commissioner's disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Miller says, the National and American leagues should adjust 
their formulas for paying visiting teams shares of their gate receipts.  
</P>
<P>
 Visiting American League teams receive 20% of the opponent's gate, while 
National League teams pay out only 5% of their take. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's comments seem even stronger when one remembers that he is not an 
employee of WBAL, the Orioles' rights holder, but of the team itself, a 
so-called big-market team. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Miller has not reached agreement with the Orioles for next year.  
</P>
<P>
 His contract expires at the end of the season and Chicago's WGN has been 
rumored to be after him hot and heavy -- either to team with or replace ailing 
Hall of Famer Harry Caray on Cubs' telecasts. 
</P>

 Miller said he has left the negotiating to his agent, Ron Shapiro, and is not 
troubled that he is not signed to a new contract, adding that he would like to 
stay in Baltimore, but is keeping his options open. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very good place for me, but you want to do what's right," Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always want to make sure we hear everybody out."

STODDARD FINDS LIFE TO BE JUST ROSY BEYOND THE NADADORES; SWIMMING: AFTER 
COACHING A TEAM IN DECLINE, HE ENJOYS BEING AROUND A PROGRAM THAT'S GROWING 
STRONG. 
</P>

 Terry Stoddard felt as if he had finally made it to the big time as a swim 
coach. One of his proteges stood on the highest level of the podium at the 
national championships, a gold medal in her hand. 
</P>
<P>
 But what was that in her other hand?  
</P>
<P>
 Stoddard's moment of glory quickly deteriorated into nausea. Debbie Babashoff 
was proudly hugging a license plate that read: "DEB 442." 
</P>
<P>
 Deb had indeed won the 500-yard freestyle in 4:42, but this didn't look like a 
novelty-shop replica. This was the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Debbie's roommate had spotted the license plate and, well, this person, uh, 
stole it," Stoddard said. "Then Debbie took it up on the award stand with her. 
The photographers were taking pictures and all I could think of was that we had 
finally made it this far and now we're going to end up getting arrested. 
Instead of celebrating, we'd be spending the night in jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made sure the license plate was turned in, but I still wonder if some guy 
opened up his sports page the next morning and saw Debbie standing there with 
his license plate." 
</P>
<P>
 Stoddard's life as head coach of the Mission Viejo Nadadores wasn't the way it 
had been for his predecessor, Mark Schubert. During the team's years as the 
uncontested juggernaut in the waters of U.S. swimming, the Nadadores clinched 
the men's, women's and combined national titles halfway through most meets. 
</P>
<P>
 Olympic and world championship medals swung from the necks of many 
Schubert-coached swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Mission Viejo Co., the program's most-benevolent benefactor in the 
1970s and early 1980s, had sold much of its property in Mission Viejo by the 
time Stoddard took over in 1986 and the buck had pretty much stopped there. 
</P>
<P>
 Schubert's goal was to achieve excellence at any cost and his Nadadores teams 
won 18 national titles. Stoddard held on to the tradition for a year -- winning 
another championship in 1987 -- but he was hired to cut costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Schubert coached the Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoddard had the Padres. 
</P>
<P>
 "My job with the Mission Viejo Co. was to spin the team out financially over a 
period of seven years," Stoddard said. "When I finished, the company turned the 
team over to the parents. It was always understood that the parents would hire 
their own coach, go their own direction." 
</P>
<P>
 When the end of his tenure arrived, Stoddard probably wanted to raise his arms 
and yell, "Free at last." He was leaving a job that had the burden of 
incredible expectations and none of the resources to reach them. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what was done," he said, "it was never enough." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When former Olympian John Naber, a member of the board of directors of Rose 
Bowl Aquatics in Pasadena, interviewed Stoddard in 1992, he already knew a lot 
about the man sitting across from him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had known him for a number of years," Naber said. "Both when I was an 
athlete and as a coach and I've always respected him, especially in terms of 
his ability to converse with adults about their children and for his ability to 
relate to young athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there were a number of things that made us decide he was the right man 
for the job. No. 1, our role model for excellence is Mission Viejo, so why not 
hire someone who's done it? Plus, he had managed a team with 250 swimmers, 
which is about what we're looking for." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Stoddard saw the opportunity to experience the satisfaction of 
the building process instead of the stress of maintaining a program against 
impossible odds. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I took over, there were only 32 kids on the team who were 13 or older," 
he said, "and in the spring of '93, I took one swimmer in one event to Junior 
Nationals. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I've tried to do here is build from the bottom up. And thanks to all the 
work of (his wife) Sheri, who runs our Swim America program, which has had more 
than 1,000 swimmers the last two summers and more than 1,500 this summer, the 
club has grown 20% over each of the last two years. We have about 170 swimmers 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 While the numbers on the roster swell -- 40 graduates of Sheri Stoddard's Swim 
America program joined the team this summer -- the ones on the clock are 
dwindling. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most satisfying thing for me is that the quality has really improved," 
Stoddard said. "We were Junior Olympic section winners this summer, and earlier 
this month we finished third in the Junior Olympics against all the age-group 
teams in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "The boys won our first JO championship and we finished third in the combined 
behind Irvine and Mission (Viejo). That was our highest finish ever." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody's talking dynasty, but those results haven't gone unnoticed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's turned a recreation program into a competitive program," Naber said. 
"The numbers aren't where we'd like them to be yet, but a team is entitled to 
grow. And that's what we want, gradual, long-term growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's any question we hired the right guy." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Rose Bowl Aquatics, formerly Arroyo Seco Swim Club, owes its genesis to 
profits generated by the 1984 Summer Olympics. The Amateur Athletic Foundation, 
which distributed grants using the Olympic funds, and a number of private and 
corporate sponsors provided the money to refurbish the Brookside Club near the 
Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is the Rose Bowl Aquatic Center, a state-of-the-art swimming and 
diving facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's awesome," Stoddard said. "There are two 50-meter pools side by side, one 
of them has a full diving complex at one end and the other is either 
long-course or short-course lap swimming. 
</P>
<P>
 "This club is going to be very big in the future. We're becoming a place where 
all the local high school swimmers want to come to get better, make their 
(Southern Section) times, help their teams, go after school records. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really an exciting time here." 
</P>
<P>
 The Stoddards, including daughters Dana, 13, and Shannon, 12, seldom escape 
the smell of chlorine these days. But they still manage to enjoy their new home 
away from the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love the country atmosphere in La Canada where we live and the schools are 
great," Stoddard said. "Both Dana and Shannon are still swimming and Dana's 
times are close enough to Junior National times to really think about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's in my group now. It was great at first, then a little tough, but now 
it's very pleasant. We've found a middle ground. She's receives coaching pretty 
well. After all, she's had swimmers from all over the world stay at our house 
over the years and seen them dedicate themselves. Both my girls are motivated, 
they know what it takes." 
</P>
<P>
 So does Terry Stoddard. 
</P>
<P>
 When Naber asked him an off-hand question during that first interview, he 
wasn't expecting an answer he would never forget. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked him what his definition of an elite athlete was," Naber said, "and he 
said, 'Any kid who asks for more work on his stroke or another set after 
workout is over, any kid who starts to pull his coach, is an elite athlete.' "

HIS ROOKIE SEASON IS BITTERSWEET; SPLASH: FORMER TITAN MCDONNELL HAS SCORED, 
AND SCORED POINTS WITH HIS COACH, BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS WINNING THE GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Paul McDonnell's 23rd birthday was filled with great personal disappointment 
as well as great personal revelation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a bad birthday," he said, "because we didn't win . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell scored three goals on July 24, but the Splash lost to the Sockers in 
San Diego in a first-place showdown. And McDonnell, as a rookie professional 
playing indoor soccer for the first time, had already learned the bottom line 
from his more experienced teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line is winning. 
</P>
<P>
 Except on this day, the bottom line was marked by an asterisk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I scored a hat trick away from home against one of the top teams in the 
league," McDonnell said. "I walked away with a sense that I do belong in this 
league, I can be successful, I can reach the next level with a couple of years 
of experience. I think that's where I got some respect from San Diego and other 
teams in the league." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a respect earned through hard work by the former Cal State Fullerton 
captain, who was a driving force behind the Titans' run to the 1993 NCAA final 
four. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's definitely one of the best rookies in this league," Splash Coach George 
Fernandez said. "He plays tough defense, he can go forward and he has scored 
some goals. He's done an outstanding job for a rookie. A lot of people only 
hear about Armando (Valdivia), but they're running 1-2, no doubt about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Valdivia may be a front-runner for rookie of the year, but McDonnell -- from 
his position as a defender -- has done some important things, too. He has 
scored nine goals and had seven assists and 22 blocks. He's averaging a goal 
about every fourth shot. 
</P>
<P>
 His style also has scored points with Fernandez, who sees something special in 
the 5-foot-11, 175-pound British citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the kid because he works so hard for me; he has a great time and has a 
great attitude," said Fernandez, a former defender who is in his first year of 
coaching. "I probably try to help him more than any other player because, from 
the beginning, he came in here as a nobody, worked very hard, . . . didn't moan 
and didn't cry. He didn't question the things I told him. He listened very 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right from the beginning I knew this kid was a special kid. Maybe it's unfair 
to the other young players -- I try to give equal time -- but I've tried to do 
a lot for Paul because I feel he has warranted it. He's done everything I could 
ask from a kid. I'm not saying everybody else hasn't, but he's been great from 
the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 In short, Fernandez looks at McDonnell and sees himself. Fernandez emerged 
from an open Sockers' tryout and eventually became an all-star. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fernandez isn't the only player who has taken McDonnell under his wing. 
Ralph Black, the team's most veteran player who plays alongside McDonnell, also 
has a special interest in his development. 
</P>
<P>
 "He works his butt off and he listens, and I see him getting a lot better if 
he sticks with the indoor game," said Black, who got the same kind of help as 
an 18-year-old professional. "He's a good find. He's got the overall package if 
he keeps his head." 
</P>
<P>
 McDonnell said Dale Ervine and Doug Neely also have been quick to provide 
advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Help is always there if you want it," McDonnell said. "It's like having four 
or five coaches." 
</P>
<P>
 All that help will be put to the test Sunday when the Splash (17-6) plays host 
to Sacramento (13-11). Black and another starting defender, Denis Hamlett, will 
miss that game because of suspensions for their roles in a bench-clearing brawl 
on Aug. 14 -- also against Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves McDonnell and Neely as the only two starters in back. Neely had 
been playing midfield in the absence of the injured Valdivia, who may -- or may 
not -- be ready for Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 "(McDonnell's) going to have to step up his game," Fernandez said. "It's going 
to be a lot of pressure on him. He's proved it game in and game out that he's 
more than capable of making the right decisions most of the time. We have three 
veterans in back so that gives me the time and space to put him in that 
position while he's learning." 
</P>
<P>
 It's all part of the growing process of becoming a professional, which has 
been an eye-opening experience. The arena, the crowds, the travel, the 
autograph seekers, all of it has awed McDonnell. But he looks, listens and 
learns, all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest thing is that you learn how to conduct yourself on the field and 
off," McDonnell said. "Even though it's not a major sport, you are in the 
limelight and some kids do look up to you and you have to conduct yourself 
appropriately so you give the club, as well as yourself, a good name." 
</P>
<P>
 And a good bottom line.

SPARKS IS READY TO REGAIN FORM AFTER INJURIES; FOOTBALL: RUNNING BACK WHO LEFT 
MONTCLAIR PREP AMID CONTROVERSY WILL RESUME WASHINGTON STATE CAREER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When Derek Sparks was issued a red Washington State practice jersey, you would 
have thought he had been handed the Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of hard work in getting that jersey," Sparks said. "When they 
gave it to me, I started getting excited. I was ready to get in there and hit. 
I felt strong again." 
</P>
<P>
 Seems like a small step for one who danced so brazenly through a four-year 
odyssey of a high school career. But for Sparks, a junior running back, it was 
a symbol. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer would he carry the stigma of that yellow shirt, the one injured 
players are required to wear. No longer would he be damaged goods. No more 
would he be a bundle of unfulfilled promises. 
</P>
<P>
 That red jersey was big. With it, returned the old Derek Sparks. After two 
years, three shoulder surgeries and a number of unanswered questions, he was 
back, talking tough and playing rough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not hesitant at all about getting hit," Sparks said. "I'm looking forward 
to that first contact. I'm ready to go. I just want to get two-a-days over with 
and then I'll set some goals for myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Time passes quickly, even in Pullman, Wash. A mere four years ago, Sparks was 
the most-controversial high school football player in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 He was hot property long before college recruiters began circling. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparks attended four high schools in as many years, including one in Texas, 
and nearly reduced the football program at Montclair Prep in Van Nuys to 
rubble. He finished at Mater Dei, where he helped the Monarchs reach the 
Southern Section Division I semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sparks vanished at Washington State. He had a solid freshman season in 
1991 and was being groomed to be the Cougars' workhorse. But the shoulder 
injury changed that. 
</P>
<P>
 It's tough to carry a load when you are a burden yourself. Sparks underwent 
two surgeries last year and missed the entire season. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the worst time in my life," he said. "I had to wonder if the man 
upstairs was saying, 'Kid, you got to find something else.' But I kept my faith 
and here I am today." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, he's at the top of the chart. Sparks is the Cougars' starting tailback, 
and that's written in stone, barring further injury. Cougar coaches already 
know his value. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparks' size -- 5 feet 11, 228 pounds -- and speed have always been an 
attractive package, and he delivered as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen very few freshmen who were as ready to play college football as 
Derek," Cougar Coach Mike Price said. "He was mature and he was strong." 
</P>
<P>
 The latter was the reason Sparks gained 269 yards and averaged 4.5 yards per 
carry his first season. He spent the year as a caddie to starter Shaumbe 
Wright-Fair, but when asked to take the leading role, Sparks shined. 
</P>
<P>
 In a junior varsity game, he gained 267 yards in 18 carries and scored five 
touchdowns. When Wright-Fair was injured, Sparks started in a 40-27 victory 
over Arizona and gained 97 yards in 16 carries. He had a 45-yard touchdown 
nullified because of a penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need to get the ball 16 to 20 times a game," Sparks said. "I'm not 
effective if I only get the ball five or six times. The more carries I get, the 
stronger I get." 
</P>
<P>
 Price plans to accommodate him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Derek is a load when he carries the ball," Price said. "He has speed, but 
he'll also plow over people. I knew he was special the first day he was here. I 
remember thinking, 'Notre Dame gets 25 of these guys each year.' If I had 25 
Derek Sparkses, coaching would be a little easier." 
</P>
<P>
 At times, there did seem to be a number of Derek Sparkses running around. 
Almost every school seemed to have one. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparks' high school career was a movable feast. He started in Wharton, Tex., 
as a freshman, then transferred to Wilmington Banning. He gained nearly 1,394 
yards for the Pilots and was selected the state sophomore player of the year by 
Cal-Hi Sports, but left after one year. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent his junior season at Montclair Prep, where he gained 1,944 yards, 
scored 35 touchdowns and was The Times' Valley back of the year. But Montclair 
Prep coaches were no better at holding onto Sparks than opponents. One game 
into the 1990 season, he broke free and was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 After playing in Montclair Prep's opener, Sparks and his cousin, Leland, 
transferred to Mater Dei. The move sparked plenty of finger-pointing on both 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sparkses were declared eligible by the Southern Section after two 
meetings, during which Montclair Prep coaches were accused of grade-tampering 
and recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Leland Sparks also went to Washington State to play football, but is 
academically ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
 Montclair Prep was placed on probation. Its football program was not allowed 
to compete in the 1991 playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a lot of bad blood," Derek Sparks said. "There were things that 
happened that shouldn't have happened. All the chaos made it hard to focus on 
football." 
</P>
<P>
 Even distracted, Sparks gained 1,745 yards for Mater Dei. But not all was 
rosy. After a 3-0 victory over Loyola, Sparks and one of his uncles -- angered 
over comments made by Loyola officials about the transfer -- taunted Loyola 
coaches, dancing in front of them, and nearly started a fight. 
</P>
<P>
 A week later, Sparks apologized. 
</P>
<P>
 His notoriety, he said, scared off some recruiters. But not Washington State's 
Price. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked at the circumstances and we found no character flaw," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparks isn't sure how or when he first injured his shoulder. He just knew it 
hurt throughout his sophomore season. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, he underwent arthroscopic surgery, and five days later gained 40 
yards against Arizona in relief of Wright-Fair. He finished his sophomore 
season in 1992 with 244 yards, but something wasn't right. 
</P>
<P>
 He carried only once for 11 yards in the Cougars' 31-28 victory over Utah in 
the Copper Bowl. A week later, he visited the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparks had reconstructive surgery on the front of his shoulder in January 
1993. He was going to miss the following season. Worse yet, his grades dropped. 
Sparks had to wear a special brace to keep his shoulder in place. It made 
schoolwork difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "In class, I couldn't find a seat I could fit into," he said. "It made it 
tough taking notes. I was on pain killers, which made me drowsy. It was a rough 
semester." 
</P>
<P>
 But he held on. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hell for six weeks," he said. "It wore me down. I've learned there are 
walls you have to climb. I could have given up. But there were things left to 
prove." 
</P>
<P>
 Sparks underwent surgery to reconstruct the front of his shoulder and came 
back healthy this spring. But Price, fearing another injury, held him out of 
contact drills. Instead, Sparks lifted weights -- he bench-presses 340 pounds 
-- worked on blocking bags and went through conditioning drills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did everything I had to do," Sparks said. "People here believed in me and I 
believed in myself. Once I get a little contact in, it's going to be smooth 
sailing." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Price: "Yeah, we expect Derek to be in a red jersey all season. 
Especially on Saturdays."

 The baseball strike isn't all bad. Not for Lynn Lovullo, the wife of Seattle 
Mariner infielder Torey Lovullo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy," she said. "We have a 9-month-old son that (Torey) hasn't 
been able to spend that much time with during the season. They are getting 
reacquainted. I'm really happy he's home." 
</P>
<P>
 Lovullo is home in Northridge, thanks to the eighth work stoppage in major 
league baseball in the past 22 years. The strike, which has no end in sight, 
has turned out to be a vacation Lovullo didn't ask for, but one he needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've just been enjoying my time off," Lovullo said, "spending some time with 
my son and my wife. It's been a pretty long year for me, a bumpy road." 
</P>
<P>
 Lovullo's season seemed over before it started when the Angels released him 
during spring training.  
</P>
<P>
 Days later, he signed with the Mariners, who have called him up from triple-A 
Calgary for three stints in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a difficult season for me traveling-wise," Lovullo said. "That's 
why I welcome the little break no matter how long it might be." 
</P>
<P>
 Had Lovullo not been called up to the Mariners 10 days before the strike began 
Aug. 12, he might still be playing in the Pacific Coast League, rather than 
playing with his son, Nicky. 
</P>
<P>
 While Lovullo, 29, is happy to be home with his son and wife of six years, the 
Montclair Prep graduate is frustrated that the break comes at the expense of 
his development as a player.  
</P>
<P>
 Lovullo has played in the Detroit Tiger, New York Yankee, Angel and Mariner 
organizations since he was drafted out of UCLA in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "I, of course, wish I was playing and improving my game right now," he said, 
"but that's just not in the cards. Unfortunately, I did get called up and I'm 
on strike." 
</P>
<P>
 Lovullo said he does not plan to take batting practice during the strike, 
because he expects to have a few days between a settlement and the resumption 
of play to get his timing back. 
</P>
<P>
 His only brush with baseball since the strike began has been "playing catch" 
at a park in Northridge with Kansas City Royal pitchers Mark Gubicza and Mike 
Magnante, who live near Lovullo. Gubicza has since returned to Kansas City, 
Lovullo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just going to try to keep my arm in shape and keep my legs in shape," 
Lovullo said.  
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't throw for a while, it's like starting all over again." 
</P>
<P>
 Lovullo added that, although he is enjoying the time with his family, he would 
like to be on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get anxious any time you're missing something you love to do," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I love to play baseball. I'm sure I'll get anxious in the next couple weeks 
because of the simple fact I love the game and want to get out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Lovullo signed a guaranteed contract with the Mariners for $165,000, meaning 
he is losing $901.64 a day during the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a union guy and I support what's going on," he said. "But I wish the fans 
would understand more of the issues. They want to single out the players, but 
there is a very good reason we are on strike right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The players went on strike primarily to protest the owners' insistence on 
installing a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations between the sides have been infrequent in the first two weeks of 
the strike, and Lovullo said he has no idea when the matter might be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear exactly what you hear," he said. "I try to remove myself from it as 
much as possible and not really get wrapped up in it. I just try to see what's 
happening on the 11 o'clock news."

TENNIS / DANA HADDAD; A RACKET IS THE WEAPON OF CHOICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Men's tennis players in South Korea harbor no dreams of playing Wimbledon and 
the U.S. Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the military conscripts them during their prime years, the country's 
outstanding players -- on any level -- are spurred only by a passion for the 
sport and an appetite for competition, according to Jung Kim, former coach of 
the South Korean men's national team.  
</P>
<P>
 Looking for a good example? Take a team from Glendale called the Thursday 
Club, coached by Kim. Formed 18 months ago, the team consists of 18 players who 
practice each Thursday. Many of them are in their 50s and started playing only 
two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 These middle-age newcomers, in their second season of weekend league 
competition, are Southern California team tennis champions.  
</P>
<P>
 They will be the first team of Korean-Americans team to compete next month in 
the United States Tennis Assn. League Tennis National Championships, after 
winning their local league and the USTA Southern California section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're very excited," Kim said. "At first, they didn't know how to play 
thinking tennis. They didn't know how to make their opponent run. But they 
learned." 
</P>
<P>
 And now they are champions. 
</P>
<P>
 They triumphed with a style Kim calls "soft tennis." Lacking the big serves 
and hard ground strokes of stronger, more-experienced players, Thursday Club 
players hit slices and lobs. They angle their shots and strive to tire their 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Punch and volley," Kim said. "Go for corners. Deep ground strokes. A lot of 
Orientals start like that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Thursday Club players consider Kim, 43, a sage. Since his arrival in 
Glendale six years ago, Koreans from all around have come to Kim to learn the 
game they never felt compelled to try as children. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no Grand Slam tennis in Korea," said Kim, a native of Seoul. "The 
Korean Tennis Assn. has a problem. Everyone has to go into the army. When the 
men get out, they are too old (to compete internationally)." 
</P>
<P>
 The Thursday Club staged a big victory party after Sunday's triumph. Now it's 
on to Tucson, Ariz., and the national tournament Sept. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're proud to be the first all-Korean team at nationals," Kim said. "They 
will bring their wives. Maybe some of their children." 
</P>

 Brawley returns: You could tell in April that Sean Brawley was feeling his 
oats. The former Newbury Park High and Villanova Prep tennis player, who also 
played at USC, was back on the court with fire in his eyes. In the semifinal 
round of the Ojai Valley tournament, Brawley defeated former Australian Open 
champion Roscoe Tanner, 7-6 (7-5), 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Brawley appears intent on returning to his roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Brawley, 33, has left the real estate business to become director of tennis at 
Spanish Hills Country Club in Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm from the area and I wanted to come back to Ventura County," said Brawley, 
who for several years has coached privately in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Spanish Hills, he said, is virgin territory and a perfect situation for him. 
The club has been open only one year and it is better-known for its golf 
course. It has only 35 tennis members.  
</P>
<P>
 Brawley, who wants to start a junior tennis program and hold USTA Junior 
Development camps, likes the new challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is great for me," Brawley said. "I get to build something." 
</P>

 Senior battle of sexes: Some of the nation's top players who reside in 
Southern California will converge Monday at the Racquet Centre in Studio City 
for the first Battle of the Sexes. Among the more interesting matches, Ron 
Brandon, 90, of Anaheim will take on Jacqueline Piatigorsky, 82, of Pacific 
Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
 Several top players from the Valley will compete as well in what Bill Lurie, 
the men's team captain, hopes will become an annual showdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players all think it's going to be a lot of fun," said Lurie, 81. "But 
there's a difference of opinion right now on how it's going to come out." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to match the players evenly, most men will play women 15 years 
younger.  
</P>
<P>
 John Bennett of West Hills, 63, who is ranked 12th in the U.S. in the 
60-and-over singles division, will square off against Dee Williams-Horne of 
Pasadena, who is No. 12 in the nation in 45s. 
</P>
<P>
 In other matches featuring Valley players, Jack Simpson of Van Nuys and H.M. 
Wammack of Glendale (men's 65 doubles) will face Williams-Horne and Tina 
Karwasky of Los Angeles (45 doubles). Former national champion Eleanor Harbula, 
77, of Sylmar will try to take out men's captain Lurie in singles.  
</P>
<P>
 Because of the four-year age difference, Harbula will get two points for every 
rally she wins on her serve.

PSYCHOLOGIST KEEPS GOLFERS ON THEIR GAME; GUIDANCE: WITH A POSITIVE OUTLOOK, 
ATHLETES CAN OVERCOME MENTAL BLOCKS, WRIGHT SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Wright knows how to ease pain. For 10 years, he helped people deal with 
serious headaches at a pain management clinic he started in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he's going after another source of agony: Golfers' angst. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright of Coto de Caza is a golf psychologist and PGA teaching professional. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the only one of my kind in the world, I think -- I'm still waiting to be 
discovered," Wright said.  
</P>
<P>
 Those who have discovered him, including PGA and LPGA tour professionals and 
successful local junior players, swear by his methods. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just listen to his voice and he makes you feel more relaxed," said Kellee 
Booth, a neighbor of Wright's who won the U.S. Junior Girls' Championship last 
summer.  
</P>
<P>
 Said PGA Tour pro Pat Burke of Azusa: "I had really gotten close to the point 
where I didn't want to play any more. I was a mess. He helped me get a 
different focus on things." 
</P>
<P>
 Said LPGA Tour pro Jennifer Wyatt: "I spent the first part of this year so 
miserable. I would come back from the course and just cry. I would be so 
frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
 After working with Wright, Wyatt says she is better at keeping her composure.  
</P>
<P>
 In golf, the most sane person might be one bad shot away from becoming a 
basket case.  
</P>
<P>
 This is where Wright steps in.  
</P>
<P>
 "Golf is a game in which you have to learn to control and let go at the same 
time," said Wright, who played a year of minor league baseball in the 
Cincinnati Reds' organization. 
</P>
<P>
 More than anything, Wright stresses patience. The deep breathing techniques he 
teaches help calm the nerves, allowing keener concentration.  
</P>
<P>
 "Golf requires such fine concentration and for such brief periods of time that 
you really have to focus on the present," Wright said. "Most of us live 
mentally in the future -- when we get in the shower we're already thinking 
about what we are going to do later that day." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright helps his students return to the here and now. Based at Pelican Hill 
Golf Club since June, Wright charges $150 (juniors $100) for about 80 minutes 
of psychological instruction. His professional clients pay him a percentage of 
their prize money. The fee includes audio tapes on relaxation and building 
consistent routines and "Mind Under Par," an instruction book he wrote and 
plans to publish in January. 
</P>
<P>
 He helps his students map out their goals -- in golf and in life. He provides 
physical fitness workouts. He counsels his junior players not to let golf 
consume them and, if necessary, helps them with a studying schedule. It's a 
comprehensive approach, but the main focus, of course, is golf. 
</P>
<P>
 When practice starts, Wright usually takes his students to the putting green 
first. "I have to do a lot of converting here," he said. "They have to believe 
in me. I'm not saying they come in skeptical, but once I show them success on 
the putting green, they're ready to listen to what I have to say in the other 
areas." 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, who has two psychology doctorates, trains his clients to visualize 
hitting each shot perfectly before taking it. "Fred Couples never hits a shot 
without recalling a similar shot he has hit well before," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, Couples has a bank of good shots from which to make withdrawals, 
but the rest of us can dream, and Wright says vivid images produce better 
shots. He builds confidence through drills -- repetition being crucial to 
learning. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, 48, never dreamed he would be making a living in golf. He rarely 
played the game until the mid-1980s. He met Derek Hardy, then a teaching pro at 
Ridgeline Country Club in Orange, and they developed a symbiotic relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy would teach Wright and his family how to play golf and Wright would 
teach Hardy about psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first met David, I was a good teacher; I had won awards and so forth," 
Hardy said. "But after working with him I became a much, much better teacher 
because I understood how people learn." 
</P>
<P>
 Hardy, named by Golf Magazine as one of the 50 best teachers in the country, 
said Wright is effective because his background is clinical instead of 
academic.  
</P>
<P>
 Wright quickly took to the game. He gave up his pain management practice and 
became an assistant pro under Hardy, eventually completing the PGA apprentice 
program. At the same time he was developing his golf psychology practice. 
</P>
<P>
 The practice naturally led him to the PGA and LPGA tours, where mental 
toughness is essential and one missed putt can cost thousands of dollars. 
Wright works with such LPGA players as Marta Figueras-Dotti, who won for the 
first time in 12 years on the tour in January, Anne-Marie Palli and Jan 
Stephenson. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been working with PGA Tour rookie Dennis Paulson for about two years. A 
1980 graduate of Costa Mesa High who played at San Diego State, Paulson turned 
pro in 1985 and played in eight PGA Tour qualifying schools before earning his 
card this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He really helped me," Paulson said. "The funny thing is, David told me from 
the beginning, 'Dennis, you've won before and you've won a lot. You know how to 
win but you need to pay attention to what is going on when you are playing 
well.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Paulson said his problem was that he got so angry at himself on the course -- 
"You're such an idiot for hitting that shot." -- that the game wasn't fun 
anymore. Wright helped Paulson learn to give himself credit and channel anger 
positively. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Paulson has won nearly $130,000, putting him in the top half of the Tour's 
money-winner list. In April he shot a course-record 62 to take the second-round 
lead in the PGA event in New Orleans. He wound up in a tie for fourth, his best 
PGA finish, but another accomplishment stands out more in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was never more proud of anything than how I played at tour school," Paulson 
said. "I never hit it in the water, never had a three-putt, never had a double 
bogey and never shot over par in any one round for six rounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, that's painless golf.

LITTLE LEAGUE WORLD SERIES NOTEBOOK; COLLECTORS' TRADE IS PINNED ON TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HENSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long before pogs, there were pins. 
</P>
<P>
 Collecting and trading small, colorful metal pins from districts worldwide is 
a longtime Little League tradition. Players receive pins for advancing through 
each level of tournament play, and pins are exchanged by teams before games as 
a show of sportsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 The pins are studded on the caps and jackets of fans, and serious collectors 
carry booklets with cloth pages full of pins. 
</P>
<P>
 Pins have various designs, including district and league logos. Others are 
more creative. One pin from District 13 in Ventura County, for example, 
features three mice with canes and dark eye glasses wearing blue suits. Beneath 
the mice are the words, "Three Blind Umps." That pin was traded Wednesday for a 
pin from Maracaibo, Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
 Pin collecting transcends age and cultural differences. One avid pin collector 
is Sylvia Sanders, wife of Merle Sanders, the 63-year-old World Series public 
address announcer and administrator of District 40, to which Northridge 
belongs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvia Sanders and Northridge League official Paula Mort were seated on the 
lawn outside Howard J. Lamade Stadium Wednesday, surrounded by children and 
hundreds of pins. Sanders boasts a collection of more than 10,000 pins gathered 
over 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nice part of pin trading is that people from all these different cities 
and countries interact," Sanders said. "I believe that pins should be only 
traded, never sold. The challenge is trade for the rare ones, the ones you've 
never seen before." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders, who has attended the past 10 World Series, has different District 40 
pins made every year by one of two companies authorized by Little League 
Baseball, Inc. The pins, she said, cost between 50 cents and $2 each to make. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The complex: In addition to Howard J. Lamade Stadium, named after the farmer 
who donated the land, the World Series complex includes Little League 
Headquarters and a Little League Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Adjacent to headquarters is the City View Motel, the rear of which overlooks 
the field. Five Northridge families have rooms there, and they watch games that 
don't involve Northridge from the porch outside their rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got a refrigerator and lounge chairs here and can watch baseball all 
day long," said Michael Nesbit, whose son, Michael is a Northridge reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Safety first: Displays at the Little League Museum illustrate the evolution of 
youth baseball equipment, with special emphasis on the creations of Creighton 
J. Hale, president and CEO of Little League Baseball, Inc., since 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Hale, 70, has a Ph.D. in physiology, and he holds patents for several pieces 
of Little League equipment, including the batter's helmet, one-piece catcher's 
helmet-mask, a chest protector that covers the throat and a fence that 
incorporates a cloth-like material that stretches on contact. 
</P>
<P>
 "Little League has been criticized for not being safety-conscious enough," 
Hale said, "but the advances we have made in equipment show that we indeed care 
deeply about safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Hale also is credited with developing a baseball shoe with molded, rubber 
cleats and with helping develop the aluminum bat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Life of luxury: Little League has made significant improvements the past two 
years to the dormitories the players and coaches live in during the World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Until 1993, the dorms were beat-up cabins with outdoor restroom facilities. 
Last year, players moved into new dorms with comfortable beds and large 
bathroom and shower facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bathroom is so big the kids play hide-and-seek in there," said Larry 
Baca, the Northridge manager, who also noted that each manager and coach has a 
separate bedroom and bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 This year a cafeteria and game room opened. The teams eat together, giving 
players a greater opportunity to interact. 
</P>
<P>
 "The beds are just like at home, with wood frames and everything," said Todd 
DeLeive, a Northridge player. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add expansion: The dorms were built with accommodations for 16 teams. Hale 
said that Little League plans to double the teams that qualify for the World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not certain when that will happen, but that is the plan," he said. 
"There will be eight teams from the U.S. and eight foreign teams." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eye on youth: The staff photographer for Little League Baseball, Inc., is Russ 
Tinsley, a Tarzana resident who has shot the World Series for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Tinsley's Los Angeles firm, Echo Film Services, has won seven Emmy awards for 
sound editing and is nominated for four Emmys this year.

JENSEN ROLE IN FIRST PENSION SCAM DETAILED; INQUIRY: MEMO TO PROSECUTORS 
DESCRIBES HOW EX-PRESIDENT OF IRVINE FIRM SET UP PHONY ACCOUNTS AND DIVERTED 
FUNDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Valerie Jensen, former president of failed First Pension Corp., set up phony 
investor accounts routinely and diverted funds offshore but balked at putting 
aside $8 million of clients' money to cover legal fees for the three principals 
of the Irvine pension management firm, according to documents obtained by The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
 In a memo written by her lawyer and sent to federal investigators, Jensen, 47, 
is portrayed as a knowing participant in criminal deeds but as a follower, not 
an instigator. "She, for the most part, acquiesced rather than directed," reads 
the memo, which was written by Jensen's Los Angeles attorney, Donald Smaltz, 
and gives an inside account of events at First Pension. 
</P>
<P>
 Jensen, along with other company principals William E. Cooper and Robert E. 
Lindley, pleaded guilty Aug. 1 to fraud in connection with a First Pension 
scheme in which investors lost $121.5 million by putting their money into phony 
second trust deed mortgage funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The three are to be sentenced on Oct. 6. Each faces a maximum fine of $500,000 
and a prison term of up to 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In the memo, sent to investigators in May, Smaltz states that Cooper and 
Lindley, knowing that First Pension was a scam and expecting a massive and 
costly criminal investigation, asked Jensen to put aside investor funds to 
cover anticipated court costs and to improve their position with investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Jensen was told in March to take $8 million "out of the system for future use 
in defending each of them against criminal prosecution and to use the money as 
a bargaining chip as restitution," the memo states. 
</P>
<P>
 Jensen refused to do so, the memo says, and was asked by Cooper a few days 
later to resign. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell Hayman, Lindley's attorney, said in an interview Wednesday the request 
that Jensen divert the money was a "misguided concept" that was later dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 "It never happened. There was no attempt to take the money and run," he said. 
"At worst, there may have been a misguided concept that, if they took the money 
and moved it to another pot and then presented a big check to the U.S. 
attorney's office, it would help their case. But no such transfer ever 
occurred."  
</P>
<P>
 Cooper's lawyer, Robert Bonner, could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The memo portrays Jensen, a native of Bakersfield, as an eager employee who 
was merely following the lead of her mentors, Cooper and Lindley. 
</P>
<P>
 Jensen began her career as a messenger for CPI Pension Administration Co. in 
Newport Beach in 1976, the memo states. Though she did not have a college 
degree, it continues, she worked her way up to a management position at CPI and 
joined First Pension in the mid-1980s as vice president and operations officer. 
</P>
<P>
 As the company began running into financial trouble in the early 1990s, the 
document states, Jensen began diverting investors' money into three offshore 
accounts that were trusts for herself, Cooper and Lindley. The accounts were 
set up, the memo states, because of the three principals' concerns that the 
Internal Revenue Service might seize assets of some First Pension affiliates. 
The memo estimates that about $1.5 million of investors' funds went into each 
offshore account and was then moved back into related First Pension entities. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the document states, Jensen set up phony client accounts that 
were used to divert money to other First Pension businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "At night, Valerie would access the computer database and alter the accounts 
to reflect money in the account," the memo states, adding that about $4.4 
million was involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Jensen did so, however, after "being prodded" by Cooper and Lindley with 
stories of "a financing just about to happen, a purchase just about to occur, a 
turn of events just around the corner," the memo states. 
</P>
<P>
 "The diverted funds did not only go to pay the operating expenses of the 
entities, but also to invest in a series of companies which were believed to 
have a high potential for success and, when the success was achieved, would 
enable the entities to repay all the money owing and thus fill up the 'hole,' " 
the memo states. "The principle became 'betting on the come' in an effort to 
strike it rich and pay off the indebtedness."

OTHERS LIKELY TO FOLLOW COMPAQ, IBM IN PRICE CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 An escalated personal computer price war between market leaders IBM and Compaq 
will likely lead to more bargains for business customers as other PC makers 
also slash prices, company officials and analysts said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 International Business Machines announced Wednesday that it would cut prices 
by 10% to 27% on personal computers, particularly on 486 desktop machines meant 
for business uses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Armonk, N.Y.-based company's decision came nine days after Compaq Computer 
Corp. in Houston dropped prices on similar models 7% to 22%. Compaq led the 
industry in sales through the first six months of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said they expect more PC makers to join soon in the cost-cutting. 
</P>
<P>
 "The silly season is here again," said Ian Gilson, an analyst with the 
investment banking firm L.H. Friend Weinress & Frankson Inc. in Irvine. He said 
that computer prices often decline at the end of the summer. "They're doing 
what they have to do to move products at the end of the summer doldrums, get 
rid of that old inventory." 
</P>
<P>
 Noel Djimtoloum, supervisor of Circuit City's computer department in West Los 
Angeles, said he expects other companies to match the lower prices, based on 
past experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Abramowitz, an analyst with Argus Research in New York, said computer 
manufacturers are pushing down prices on their business-oriented, high-end 
computers because the pace of corporate upgrading has slowed recently. Strong 
retail demand at the consumer level will probably keep prices close to their 
current levels for the time being despite the newly announced cuts, Abramowitz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Apple Computer said the company was in a different pricing 
situation than IBM and Compaq, since its machines are built around different 
processing chips, and that Apple does not plan any announcements in the near 
future regarding price cuts. A spokesman for AST Research Inc. said the 
Irvine-based company would not comment on pricing questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Compaq has larger profit margins on its machines and therefore can afford a 
price war better than IBM's PC unit, said Michael Kwatinetz, a PaineWebber 
analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses are usually savvier buyers of computer equipment, and their ability 
to buy in bulk makes them a natural target for computer manufacturers who want 
to move as many machines as possible before new products are introduced at an 
autumn trade show, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Smith, a systems support analyst for Century 21 International in Irvine, 
said the real estate franchise company is taking a hard look at what new 
machines it might order in the wake of the discounts. Century 21 was in the 
process of buying a large number of machines from Compaq, he said, adding that 
the company has bought several thousand mostly Compaq PCs so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Compaq's lower prices now have Century 21 considering whether it should 
continue to buy Compaq's 486 machines as planned or whether it could now afford 
to buy its computers based on the faster Pentium chip. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were expecting there to be some cuts," Smith said. "We had held off making 
the jump (to the Pentium machines) because of the price. . . . Now it's a hard 
business decision about which way to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Area retailers said it could take a few weeks for the cuts by Compaq and IBM 
to make their way into stores -- and perhaps longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Tigran Tsiligian, a corporate sales account executive with CompUSA in Culver 
City, said his business customers are not aware of the recent round of PC 
price-cutting until "we bring it to their attention and stick it in their 
face."  
</P>
<P>
 And consumers -- conditioned to expect falling prices -- said they are numb to 
news of additional discounts and uninspired by the latest round of price wars. 
</P>
<P>
 "There really is no good time to buy a computer because a price war is always 
going on," said Mel Gallardo, who was shopping for a computer Wednesday in at a 
Computer City store in Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything always gets smaller, quicker, faster and cheaper," agreed shopper 
Betsy Baker. "When the prices drop, it just means something (better) is coming 
along." 
</P>
<P>
 But Donald Russell said he would wait until Christmas to buy a personal 
computer if it meant saving $200. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM shares closed down 37.5 cents at $67.25 in New York Stock Exchange trading 
Wednesday. Compaq shares were unchanged at $36.25.

TMI OPERATORS DENY INVESTMENT FUND IS INSOLVENT; SUIT: OWNERS CHALLENGE 
ALLEGATION THAT O.C.-BASED FIRM LOST $100 MILLION, BLAME DEPRESSED REAL ESTATE 
MARKET FOR SETBACKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Operators of Teachers Management & Investment Inc., which raised as much as $1 
billion from 60,000 California educators and others, said Wednesday they 
"absolutely deny" allegations that the fund is insolvent and may have lost at 
least $100 million of investors' money. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawsuit filed by four investors Tuesday in Orange County Superior Court 
seeks immediate appointment of a receiver to take over TMI. In their statement, 
company owners James R. Martin and Maurice Shuman described the plaintiffs as 
"dissident investors" and vowed to "vigorously defend" TMI and each of its 
dozens of real estate partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real problem that our investors have faced is the substantially changed 
and depressed California real estate market," the statement said. "Although we 
have made headway in overcoming a great number of market-occasioned problems, 
we still have a large job to complete." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit alleges that TMI officials lost millions of dollars of investors' 
money in a "systematic and increasingly sophisticated pattern of prohibited 
activity" to cover losses in its real estate partnerships. That activity, the 
suit states, included "commingling of funds and payments made out of trust 
amounting in the end to a Ponzi scheme undermining the security of possibly as 
much as $1 billion in retirement funds." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Rus, the plaintiffs' lawyer, filed a request Wednesday for a temporary 
restraining order that would prohibit TMI's officers from altering or 
destroying documents. A hearing on the request is set for 1:30 p.m. today. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers and other investors who put thousands of dollars of their retirement 
funds into TMI hailed the news that legal action was being taken against TMI. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the last two years we thought we'd just have to kiss that money goodby," 
said Betty Gorelick, a former Los Angeles elementary school teacher who 
invested about $15,000 -- all of her retirement funds -- in two TMI 
partnerships that later filed for bankruptcy. "But with the suit, maybe there 
is a glimmer of hope yet," the Northridge resident said. "I'm glad something is 
getting started." 
</P>
<P>
 John Weber, a dentist in Hemet, said he lost $60,000 of his five employees' 
retirement money after he invested their pension fund in several TMI limited 
partnerships that later went bankrupt. He made the investment, he said, on the 
advice of his mother-in-law, who was a high school teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first few years, we got excellent returns," he said. "But then I lost 
all my employees' money. I had to make up the money for them, and there wasn't 
even a tax write-off." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Rawson, 64, a retired high school teacher from Cuyama in Santa Barbara 
County who has $30,000 invested with TMI, said he is hopeful about the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be nice if we could get something back, but I'd be satisfied if we 
could just hang those suckers," he said of TMI's officers. "I think the real 
estate market caused TMI some problems, but I also think we were ripped off by 
the management." 
</P>
<P>
 Formed in 1968 by a group of educators and real estate specialists, privately 
owned TMI has been a vehicle for teachers and school administrators to sweeten 
their retirement funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, TMI has owned through its limited partnerships a number of 
commercial properties, including hotels in Northern California; office 
complexes; the Parducci Winery lands in Mendocino County; as well as thousands 
of acres of undeveloped property. 
</P>
<P>
 While the state's real estate market was booming during the 1970s and '80s, 
TMI investors saw handsome profits, but when the market collapsed in the late 
1980s, that ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "TMI did not escape unscathed" from the real estate downturn, according to a 
1993 report from the company. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our income property and hotel partnership, TMI found itself in the 
unenviable position of trying to restructure limited partnerships whose assets 
had fallen in value and whose lenders were under enormous regulatory pressure 
to resolve under-collateralized and other non-performing loans." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the report said, some hotels owned by the company lost more than 50% 
of their value, and many went into foreclosure. Though the company sold more 
than $136 million of property in the preceding six years, the report stated, by 
1993 land sales "have virtually stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit filed this week also alleges that TMI's owners set up private 
management companies to which they paid large sums for services to the TMI 
limited partnerships -- effectively paying themselves millions of dollars a 
year more than the management fees stipulated in the partnership agreements and 
prospectuses. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit alleges that at least $3.5 million went to those affiliated 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were paying money to themselves to pay for development of the land," 
investor Rawson said. "You do that one time, but you don't go asking the 
investors to pay for that every cotton-picking year." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit includes a long list of TMI endeavors that went sour. One of those 
was Otay Mesa III Ltd. TMI sold investors 2,000 shares in the partnership in 
1983, raising $7.73 million to buy land in an unincorporated area of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a report from the company's auditor, KPMG Peat Marwick, early 
this year, however, the partnership had recurring losses, and the note on the 
property was in default. That raised "substantial doubt about the entity's 
ability to continue as a going concern," the auditor reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Among TMI's other investments were a number of hotels, the lawsuit states. One 
of those was the Sheraton Sunrise Hotel in Rancho Cordova near Sacramento, 
which the company bought in the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, the partnership that owned the hotel filed for bankruptcy protection, 
the suit states. Under the reorganization plan, TMI was to raise $3.7 million 
from investors, its reserves and a joint venture partner to pay off its debts. 
Instead, the suit states, TMI fell further behind in its payments on the hotel 
and eventually defaulted on a $14.5-million loan from Eureka Bank in Foster 
City. After going into foreclosure in 1992, the hotel was sold to a group of 
Hong Kong investors. The TMI Story 
</P>
<P>
 A history of Teachers Management & Investment Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 1968 
</P>
<P>
 * The beginning: Robert Fitzpatrick, a former real estate broker, forms TMI 
with a group of teachers and administrators. They agree that only educators 
will be able to invest. The shares cost $500 apiece. 
</P>
<P>
 1970 
</P>
<P>
 * Expansion: Its symbol a shiny red apple and its motto "Teachers Helping 
Teachers," TMI begins employing educators to moonlight as sales agents. Through 
the '70s, the company pools millions of dollars of investors' funds and uses 
most of the money to buy undeveloped land through limited partnerships. 
Investors receive an average annual return of more than 30% from 1967 to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 1985 
</P>
<P>
 * Complaint filed: In May, a group that includes former TMI employees and 
sales agents files a 350-page complaint against TMI with the Department of 
Corporations alleging that company operators pocketed millions of dollars from 
land deals and brokerage commissions that should have gone to TMI investors. 
After a two-year investigation, the department finds no violations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bank seized: In August, Centennial Savings & Loan in Santa Rosa, which owns 
75% of TMI's stock, is declared insolvent and closed by federal regulators. TMI 
falls under control of the Federal Savings and Loan Insurance Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 1987 
</P>
<P>
 * Stock purchase: In February, two Orange County accountants, Maurice Shuman 
and James R. Martin, agree to buy 75.5% of the outstanding TMI stock owned by 
Centennial Federal Savings and Loan Assn. for $4.1 million in cash. The two 
hope to buy 60,000 more shares to push ownership to 81.5%. Martin, who had 
retired from Peat Marwick, had been account manager and tax partner for TMI 
since 1968. Shuman, who has his own accounting practice in Newport Beach, had 
worked with Martin on various transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 * New management: In May, the purchasers oust TMI founder Fitzpatrick and 
announce aggressive expansion plans to add 200 account managers to its current 
sales staff of 320. A new office is opened in Seattle, and plans are announced 
for another in Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 1994 
</P>
<P>
 * Suit filed: A group of TMI investors files suit alleging that the company is 
insolvent. The investors seek the appointment of a receiver to take over 
management of TMI. Company officials cannot be reached Tuesday for comment on 
the allegations.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; WEAK FACTORY ORDERS SEND DOW SOARING 70.90; MARKETS: 
INVESTORS SEE THE ECONOMY SLOWING AND LESS CHANCE OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE BOARD 
RAISING INTEREST RATES AGAIN SOON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stock prices zoomed Wednesday as new conviction that the U.S. economy is 
slowing brought sidelined buyers rushing into the market. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average soared 70.90 points, or 1.9%, to 3,846.73, 
the highest close for the blue chip index since March 23 and the biggest 
one-day rise since an 82.06-point gain April 5. 
</P>
<P>
 The surprise rally, in heavy trading, was sparked by the government's report 
that orders for durable goods slumped 4.2% in July. The report suggested that 
the Federal Reserve Board's efforts to tighten credit this year are finally 
producing the desired effect: a weaker economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Though slower growth could hurt corporate profits in the near term, Wall 
Street bulls assume that the economic expansion may last longer if it's at a 
more moderate pace and with less upward pressure on interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 While some economists said the durable goods numbers weren't as bad as they 
appeared, bond yields tumbled Wednesday, further encouraging stock buyers. The 
bellwether 30-year Treasury bond yield dropped to 7.45% from 7.54% on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Summer's ending and it looks like we've got an attempt to have a real rally," 
said Alan Ackerman, analyst at investment firm Reich & Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said the Dow's two-day gain Tuesday and Wednesday of nearly 100 points 
has roused many investors from traditional August vacations, forcing them to 
make decisions about putting new money to work or taking some off the table. 
"Some shocked people were making calls" Wednesday to brokers, Ackerman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gail Dudack, analyst at brokerage S.G. Warburg & Co. in New York, said the 
market has been showing strong signs in recent weeks that a rally was coming. 
She noted that the Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks has been 
advancing briskly since Aug. 5, even as the blue chip Dow has drifted in a 
narrow range. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, Dudack said, individual and institutional investors have been 
building up cash reserves since spring, waiting for concrete evidence that the 
economy is slowing enough to put at least a temporary lid on interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have been waiting for a trend to evolve," Dudack said. With the 
durable goods report signaling economic weakness, "this is a trend evolving," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She believes the Dow could rise as high as 4,200 if interest rates stay down 
and sidelined investors jump back into stocks. The Dow's all-time high was 
3,978.36, reached Jan. 31 -- just before the Fed tightened credit for the first 
time in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Ackerman noted that the market could benefit near-term from high "short" 
positions: Bearish traders who have sold borrowed stock, betting on further 
price declines, will be compelled to close out their positions by buying shares 
on the open market if the rally continues. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, on Wednesday the Nasdaq Stock Market said short-interest totaled a 
record 849.3 million shares as of Aug. 15, up 1.7% from a month earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 But some pros warned that this rally could be short-lived, like others since 
spring. "I think it's a rally in a neutral market," said Jerry Appel, analyst 
at Systems & Forecasts newsletter in Great Neck, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that Wednesday's advance wasn't as broad as the Dow's gain would 
suggest. Winners topped losers by only 14 to 8 on the Big Board, and most stock 
indexes rose far less than the Dow. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, 20 points of the Dow's gain came in the final minutes, on 
computer-driven program trades. 
</P>
<P>
 Appel doubts the Dow will climb much past its record, if that high. "Interest 
rate concerns are going to be with us for a while," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Wednesday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Industrial stocks led the advance, betting on an extended economic 
expansion. Alcoa leaped 2 1/8 to 79 1/2, International Paper surged 3 1/2 to 74 
7/8, 3M jumped 1 3/8 to 56 3/8, GM rose 2 1/4 to 50 7/8 and Caterpillar gained 
2 3/4 to 114 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some retailers were also strong. Nordstrom rose 1 to 46 1/2, Sears gained 1 
to 47 1/4, Dillard added 3/4 to 27 7/8 and Home Depot was up 1/2 to 45 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the downside, profit taking clipped many tech stocks. IBM was off 1/4 to 
67 3/8, Texas Instruments fell 2 1/4 to 78 3/4 and Micron Technology lost 1 3/8 
to 40 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Biotech leader Amgen slumped 2 3/4 to 53 1/4 after two analysts downgraded 
the stock, citing its recent advance. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign markets, Mexico City's Bolsa index resumed its rally, climbing 
42.69 points to 2,798.22. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, the FTSE-100 surged 30.1 points to 3,205.2, while Frankfurt's DAX 
index rebounded 18.50 points to 2,126.37. Tokyo's Nikkei-225 rose 130.82 points 
to 20,511.60.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: ON-LINE PIZZA IDEA IS CLEVER BUT ONLY HALF-BAKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL SCHRAGE, Michael Schrage is a writer, consultant and research 
associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Neal Stephenson's amusingly cynical novel "Snow Crash," he describes a 
future where Americans excel at only two things: writing software and 
delivering pizza in less than 30 minutes. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Hold the cheesiness! Apparently, the folks at Pizza Hut take these sorts of 
scenarios seriously. The nation's largest pizza home delivery service has just 
launched its PizzaNet on line. Why phone or fax your order for a 14-inch 
extra-cheese, half-mushroom, half-pepperoni with onion -- hold the oregano! -- 
pizza when you can order it virtually via the Internet? It's the Geek Chic way 
to nosh. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest part was to get the Internet connection in," confides Jon Payne, 
Pizza Hut's director of point-of-sales development, who is overseeing the 
technical aspects of the PizzaNet pilot in Santa Cruz. "Otherwise, this was 
very easy to execute . . . almost routine. The cost of doing this was minimal; 
we had done a lot of the necessary software already." 
</P>
<P>
 If Santa Cruz responds well, says Payne, PizzaNet could be rolled out 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 PizzaNet customers need to do more than just log on. To participate in the 
pilot, hungry Santa Cruzers need computers with Internet access and a version 
of an Internet interface program called Mosaic. Using the Internet's World Wide 
Web to access the centralized PizzaNet server at Pizza Hut headquarters in 
Wichita, Kan., customers see a customized menu for ordering their pizzas. 
Customers then enter in their vital statistics, along with the orders for pizza 
and beverages. 
</P>
<P>
 This data is then transmitted via the Internet back to Wichita, then relayed 
via modem and conventional phone lines to the computer system at the customer's 
nearest Pizza Hut. To minimize the risks of digital pizza pranksters, the local 
restaurant then telephones users to verify orders. Money changes hands only at 
the point of delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 Now isn't that simple? OK, not as simple as picking up the phone, but it's 
early in the cyberpizza game. And Payne reports a few Net-based orders have 
already begun to trickle in. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, as computationally clever as on-line ordering may be, it misses the 
point of what this medium can do. Fundamentally, there's not much difference 
between ordering a pizza over the phone and ordering one on-line. The 
transaction is basically a commodity. The trick is to figure out new ways to 
create value for the customer. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of simply letting people order a pizza, why not let them design it as 
well? Instead of showing an ordinary menu with a list of toppings, show a 
picture of a pizza with the toppings clustered on the side. Let teen-agers and 
college students build their own pizzas on-screen. Present a palette of 
toppings and let people place their mushrooms and green peppers and pepperoni 
anywhere on the pizza they want. The real pizza is customized accordingly. In 
other words, computer-aided pizza engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 This is precisely the sort of interactivity that computers and networks are 
good at. There can be as much value in the design -- maybe more -- as in the 
transaction. So sell it! The pizza home delivery market is more than $6.4 
billion a year. Surely, a lot of those people would be prepared to pay a little 
premium to custom-design their own pizza. 
</P>

 Indeed, a Pizza Hut or Domino's might even be able to sell its "pizza design" 
software to customers. Turn making the family pizza into a video game. Needless 
to say, this software makes transaction management easier for the pizza 
company. So everybody can win. 
</P>
<P>
 It's important to remember that this doesn't require any new technology. This 
can all be done over the Internet today, if some enterprise is willing to make 
a small investment. There are countless opportunities for entrepreneurs to 
offer customers a blend of designability and delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's another example of what MIT Media Lab associate professor Michael 
Hawley likes to call the "Media Fab" potential of the Internet. Why not 
customized T-shirts? Log on to the Internet and browse through assorted logos 
and designs. Mix, match and modify them to suit your interest. Then superimpose 
them onto the virtual T-shirt on the screen. Hit the right key and within 48 
hours your new shirt is Fed-Exed to the desired address. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this network designability concept easily extends to bouquets of 
flowers, boxes of chocolates, fruit baskets and the $6.85-billion annual market 
in mail-order clothes shopping. It would be perfect for all kinds of gift 
giving. 
</P>
<P>
 Where's Barry Diller when you need him? This -- not QVC or Home Shopping 
Network -- is how the most profitable interactive shopping will be done 
tomorrow. The ability to customize your choices in an entertaining and 
intriguing way is something people are prepared to pay for. 
</P>
<P>
 "The point is, what we want to do is make it fun to order and have fun with it 
and turn our product into a service," says Pizza Hut's Payne. "I suspect there 
will be some element of entertainment involved to make this thing really go. . 
. . I expect to get a lot of creative ideas over the Internet about what we 
should do next." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, somebody should send Neal Stephenson a pizza. He deserves it.

PC MAKER PRICE WAR EXPECTED TO CREATE BARGAINS; COMPUTERS: IBM, COMPAQ CUTS 
LIKELY TO SPARK A NEW FRENZY, ANALYSTS SAY, BUT BUSINESS CLIENTS ARE SEEN 
GAINING THE MOST. 
</P>

<P>
 An escalated personal computer price war, sparked by new cuts from market 
leaders IBM and Compaq, is expected to create more bargains as other PC makers 
also slash prices, company officials and analysts said Wednesday. But business 
customers, rather than consumers, are likely to reap most of the benefits, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 International Business Machines confirmed Wednesday that it would cut prices 
between 10% and 27% on personal computers sold to business customers. The 
Armonk, N.Y.-based company's decision came nine days after Houston-based Compaq 
Computer Corp. -- the industry sales leader through the first six months of the 
year -- dropped prices on similar models between 7% and 22%. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said they expected other PC makers to join in. 
</P>
<P>
 "The silly season is here again," said Ian Gilson, analyst with L.H. Friend 
Weinress & Frankson Inc. in Irvine, who noted that computer prices often 
decline at the end of the summer. "They're doing what they have to do to move 
products at the end of the summer doldrums, get rid of that old inventory." 
</P>
<P>
 Noel Djimtoloum, supervisor of Circuit City's computer department in West Los 
Angeles, said he expects other companies to match the lower prices, based on 
past experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Abramowitz, an analyst with Argus Research in New York, said computer 
makers are pushing business-oriented, high-end computers because the pace of 
corporate upgrading has slowed recently. Strong demand among consumers will 
probably keep retail prices close to their current levels for now, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Compaq, with its higher profit margins, can afford a price war more than IBM's 
PC unit can, said Michael Kwatinetz, a PaineWebber analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 But Southern California computer dealers said a variety of factors affect the 
price of PCs on showroom floors, such as other dealers' prices and manufacturer 
incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 They also suggested it could take a few weeks for the cuts by Compaq and IBM 
to make their way into stores -- and perhaps longer for the buying public to 
notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Tigran Tsiligian, a corporate sales account executive with Comp USA in Culver 
City, said his business customers are not aware of the recent round of PC price 
cutting until "we bring it to their attention and stick it in their face."  
</P>
<P>
 And consumers -- conditioned to expect falling prices -- said they are numb to 
such news and uninspired by the latest price war. 
</P>
<P>
 "There really is no good time to buy a computer because a price war is always 
going on," said Mel Gallardo, who was shopping for a computer Wednesday in 
Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything always gets smaller, quicker, faster and cheaper," agreed shopper 
Betsy Baker. "When the prices drop, it just means something (better) is coming 
along." 
</P>
<P>
 Business vendors, who buy between five and 500 desktop computers at once, are 
usually more savvy buyers. Their tendency to buy in bulk makes them a natural 
target for computer manufacturers who want to move as many machines as possible 
before new products are introduced at an autumn trade show, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Smith, a systems support analyst for Century 21 International in Irvine, 
said the real estate company is taking a hard look at what new machines it 
might order in the wake of price cuts. Century 21 has a purchasing agreement 
with Compaq, he said, and bought several thousand PCs this year alone. 
</P>
<P>
 But Compaq's cuts now have Century 21 considering whether it should buy 
machines using the Intel 486 chip that it had been planning to acquire, or 
whether it could afford to buy computers based on Intel's more expensive, 
faster Pentium chip.

JUSTICE OFFICIALS TO PROBE SOME PRACTICES IN BANK INDUSTRY; CONSUMERS: 
INVESTIGATION INTO SERVICE FEES IS TRIGGERED BY ADVOCATE GROUPS' ALLEGATIONS OF 
ANTITRUST VIOLATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 The Justice Department said Wednesday that it is looking into allegations by 
consumer groups that banks are violating federal antitrust laws when they set 
fees for bounced checks, automated teller machines and other services. 
</P>
<P>
 The probe was apparently triggered by a request from the Consumer Federation 
of America and the U.S. Public Interest Research Group, two watchdog groups 
that claim such fees vary little from one institution to the next. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department spokeswoman Gina Talamona would say only that the agency is 
conducting an investigation into "certain practices in the banking industry." 
She said the department does not comment on ongoing cases. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in a recent letter to the two advocacy groups, antitrust division 
chief Anne Bingaman said the Justice Department took the groups' charges 
seriously and is "looking into them." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Crotty, a top lawyer for the American Bankers Assn., said his trade 
group is unaware of any ongoing Justice Department investigation of the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 But Crotty called charges that banks are violating antitrust laws "absolutely 
false" and said it would be impossible to get every financial institution in 
the nation to set uniform prices for their services. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more than 10,000 banks across the country plus thousands more 
thrifts and credit unions," Crotty said. "Consumers know that if they don't 
like their bank's services or fees, there are plenty of other places where they 
can go." 
</P>
<P>
 A full-scale investigation by the department would be a coup for consumer 
advocates, who say that regulators and lawmakers have largely ignored their 
complaints that banks are gouging their customers and may be breaking antitrust 
laws. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're tired of being ignored, and we're glad that somebody in Washington 
finally seems to be listening," said Jon Goldinger, who has been researching 
consumer banking issues in the Los Angeles office of the California Public 
Interest Research Group. 
</P>
<P>
 In a June 22 letter to the Justice Department requesting an antitrust 
investigation, the consumer groups said that prices for a variety of typical 
bank services "seem to appear in lock step across the industry and across the 
nation." 
</P>
<P>
 The groups also said that banking trade groups regularly sponsor conferences 
where bankers "gather to share pricing information and strategies," which could 
discourage industrywide competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The consumer groups say they have other evidence that supports their charges 
of price gouging and indicate possible antitrust violations. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, they say, about 85% of all banks now charge customers a fee of 
about $5 when they unwittingly deposit a bad check to their account, up from 
just 35% three years ago. Those fees will generate more than $1 billion for 
banks this year alone, the groups say. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 82% of banks now charge customers for using their cards at another 
bank's ATM, up from 67% in 1989. The typical charge is $1, the groups said.

OFF THE TICKER: JOE CAMEL VS. THE MARLBORO MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Across the country, Joe Camel is apparently bursting through billboards 
advertising his biggest rival, the Marlboro Man. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Camel peers over an image of a cowboy on horseback and holds out a pack of 
Camel Lights. The tag line reads: "Genuine Taste, Never Boring." 
</P>
<P>
 R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. thought the time was right to go after Marlboro 
smokers, said Peggy Carter, a spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the fiscal second quarter, Marlboro had 28.8% of the estimated 
$48-billion U.S. cigarette market. Camel had about 3.8% of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're saying, 'Hey, competitive smoker, we're talking to you,' in that fun 
and irreverent vein that is Joe Camel's style," Carter said.

DOLE FOOD PROPOSES BUYBACK OF MINORITY STAKE IN CASTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dole Food Co. on Wednesday proposed to buy back for $72 million in cash the 
minority stake in Castle & Cooke Homes that it spun off to the public just last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles-based Castle & Cooke, a major real estate developer in Bakersfield 
and on the Hawaiian island of Oahu, said its outside directors will consider 
Dole's $14-a-share bid to buy the 17% of common stock Dole doesn't already own. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1993, Dole, headed by Los Angeles-based investor David H. Murdock, 
sold the minority stake in Castle & Cooke at $15 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 But the stock has floundered -- falling 14% this year. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Castle stock jumped $2.50 to $14.125 on the New York Stock 
Exchange as investors apparently expected higher offers to appear. Meanwhile, 
Dole Food shares rose 50 cents to close at $29.25. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say (the initial spinoff of Castle & Cooke) was a very successful 
undertaking," said Mark Matheson, a senior research analyst at Los 
Angeles-based Crowell, Weedon & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Matheson said investors who expect a higher bid might be disappointed. Dole 
"owns most of the stock and no one is going to outbid them." 
</P>
<P>
 Castle & Cooke stock, like that of developers across the nation, has been 
pummeled this year as rising interest rates have slowed down the pace of home 
buying. In addition, Castle & Cooke's profit margins were disappointing this 
year and even in 1993, analysts said. Murdock, who owns 23% of Dole and chairs 
both Dole and Castle & Cooke, has publicly stated his intentions to separate 
Dole's food operations from its real estate assets. While it's unclear what 
Murdock will do with Castle & Cooke and his commercial real estate holdings, 
he's still making money. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, 1993, he bought 85,700 shares of the home builder not held by Dole at 
prices ranging from $11.13 to $12.88 each, bringing his personal holdings to 
94,500 shares, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Several food analysts said the purchase could provide a way for Dole to spin 
off its money-losing Hawaiian resort operation by packaging those holdings with 
the profitable Castle & Cooke. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lanai resort "has been cash-flow negative since its inception and is 
unlikely to generate earnings in the near term," wrote NatWest Securities Corp. 
analysts Michael Branca and Mitchell Speiser. "The best way to realize value 
out of its Lanai resort operation is to consolidate it with the real estate 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 At Dole's bid price of $14, Murdock would realize a profit of between $95,984 
and $245,959 on the buyback. 
</P>
<P>
 "With so few shares outstanding, he probably saw the cost of operating as a 
public company wasn't worth it," said home building analyst Timothy L. Jones of 
Southeast Research Partners. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Castle & Cooke said the proposed transaction is subject to 
the approval of a committee of outside directors, preparation and execution of 
definitive agreements, and other conditions. The committee will retain an 
independent investment banking firm to evaluate the offer.

 Shell, Texaco in Settlement With EPA: Divisions of Shell Oil Co. and Texaco 
Inc. agreed to pay civil penalties of $337,703 and $350,000, respectively, to 
settle federal complaints of environmental offenses in California. The 
agreements, announced by the Environmental Protection Agency, involve Shell 
Western E&P Inc.'s Belridge oil field in Kern County and Texaco Refining and 
Marketing Inc.'s Bakersfield refinery.In Texaco's case, the EPA claimed the 
refinery disposed of hazardous wastes by discharging selenium-contaminated 
water into an underground injection well. And the EPA said Shell Western 
repeatedly vented volatile organic compounds, or VOCs, from two of its 
dehydration plants directly into the air between March, 1988, and March, 1993, 
in violation of its permit. No immediate comment was available from either 
company.

TMI BLAMES REAL ESTATE CRASH FOR LOSSES; INVESTMENTS: CLIENTS' LAWSUIT ALLEGES 
MISMANAGEMENT AND A COVER-UP. IT SEEKS TO PLACE THE FUND IN RECEIVERSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Operators of Teachers Management & Investment Inc., accused in a lawsuit of 
mishandling tens of millions of dollars in teacher retirement funds, said 
Wednesday they "absolutely deny" the allegations and vowed to fight them in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 TMI, which raised perhaps $1 billion from 60,000 teachers, blamed the fund's 
losses on the collapse of the real estate market in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit, filed by four investors Tuesday in Orange County Superior Court, 
alleges that the fund may have lost $100 million and is insolvent. It seeks 
immediate appointment of a receiver to take over TMI. 
</P>
<P>
 In their statement Wednesday, company owners James R. Martin and Maurice 
Shuman described the plaintiffs as "dissident investors" and said they would 
"vigorously defend" TMI and each of its dozens of real estate partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real problem that our investors have faced is the substantially changed 
and depressed California real estate market," the statement said. "Although we 
have made headway in overcoming a great number of market-occasioned problems, 
we still have a large job to complete." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit alleges that TMI officials lost millions of dollars of investors' 
money in a "systematic and increasingly sophisticated pattern of prohibited 
activity" undertaken to cover losses in its real estate partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 That activity, the suit states, included "co-mingling of funds and payments 
made out of trust, amounting in the end to a Ponzi scheme undermining the 
security of possibly as much as $1 billion in retirement funds." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Rus, the plaintiffs' lawyer, filed a request Wednesday for a temporary 
restraining order that would prohibit TMI's officers from altering or 
destroying documents. A hearing on the request is scheduled for today. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers and others who invested thousands of dollars of their retirement 
funds in TMI hailed the news that legal action was being taken. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the last two years we thought we'd just have to kiss that money 
good-bye," said Betty Gorelick, a former Los Angeles elementary school teacher 
who invested about $15,000 in two TMI partnerships that later filed for 
bankruptcy. "But with the suit, maybe there is a glimmer of hope yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Formed in 1968 by a group of educators and real estate specialists, privately 
owned TMI has been a vehicle by which teachers and school administrators could 
sweeten their retirement funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, TMI through its limited partnerships has owned a number of 
commercial properties, including hotels in Northern California, office 
complexes, the Parducci Winery lands in Mendocino County and thousands of acres 
of undeveloped property. 
</P>
<P>
 While California's real estate market was booming during the 1970s and '80s, 
TMI investors saw handsome profits. That ended when the market collapsed in the 
late 1980s.

 PG&E Tells Employees of Cost-Cutting Moves: In a closed-circuit TV 
announcement this week, Stanley T. Skinner, president and chief executive of 
Pacific Gas & Electric Co., announced a wide range of cost-cutting measures 
intended to save $285 million in 1995. The utility will cut $100 million from 
its customer energy efficiency programs and $2 million from low-emission 
vehicle projects, drop its membership in the Electric Power Research Institute 
and other trade organizations, end a $1-million subsidy to an employees 
campground and a social events group, stop paying workers for unused vacation 
days and freeze wages. The plan also calls for trimming Skinner's and Chairman 
Richard A. Clarke's compensation by 5%.

 Novell Says It Will Lay Off 1,750: The Utah-based company reported a 
$4-million loss for its third quarter and said it will make the cuts during the 
next six months to ease its financial situation. Novell Inc., which produces 
the best-selling software for linking personal computers in networks, has seen 
costs rise and revenues decline to an extent greater than expected from its 
June purchase of WordPerfect Corp., a maker of word-processing and other PC 
programs.The cutback amounts to about 17% of the combined work force of Novell 
and WordPerfect and follows a reduction of 1,025 workers made at WordPerfect in 
January. In a letter to employees, Chief Executive Bob Frankenberg said the 
company was having "stressful times" while consolidating Novell and 
WordPerfect.

 Government Steps Up Minivan Brakes Inquiry: The National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration said it has upgraded an investigation of reports of 
failures in anti-lock braking systems in Chrysler minivans. In its monthly 
defect investigation report, the NHTSA said it has received 837 complaints 
about problems with the brakes in 1991, '92 and '93 models of the Plymouth 
Voyager and Grand Voyager, the Dodge Caravan, Grand Caravan, Caravan C-V and 
the Chrysler Town and Country.Three related injuries and 26 accidents were 
cited in the report. About 254,185 of the vehicles are on the road. "Chrysler 
claims that most complaints involve 1991 models, which were recalled, but NHTSA 
continues to receive consumer complaints each week involving 1991 through 1993 
models," the agency said in its report.

 New Video Games Accessory Touted: 3DO Co. will go for a larger share of the 
video game market by upgrading its disk-playing system with an accessory based 
on the PowerPC microprocessor, its chief executive said. The 64-bit M2 
Accelerator, to be available in late 1995, will play advanced games with 
improved graphics as well as the games for the current 32-bit Interactive 
Multiplayer."We're the only guy out there today with an advanced system, and we 
expect to stay in the lead," said Trip Hawkins, the Redwood City, Calif., 
company's president and chief executive. He said Sega, Nintendo and Sony also 
plan to come out with advanced game systems over the next year but that their 
products won't play the games in use today.

PASCAL NAMED PRESIDENT OF PRODUCTION AT TURNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a long-rumored move, Turner Pictures Worldwide named Amy Pascal president 
of production Wednesday. Pascal, a former executive vice president of 
production at Columbia Pictures, is to produce up to eight theatrical features 
a year under the Turner Pictures banner by 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Media mogul Ted Turner is ramping up production as part of a broad Hollywood 
expansion. Earlier this year, he purchased two of the industry's most 
successful independent companies, New Line Cinema and Castle Rock 
Entertainment, for a combined $750 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Sassa, president of Turner Entertainment Group, said the three companies 
will eventually be making 40 movies a year among them. At that rate, Turner 
will eclipse some of the major studios. But Sassa says he's not sure if the 
company will acquire its own studio facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ultimately, we all have leases on current buildings," he said, "but we would 
like to see everyone under one roof. I'm not sure if that means a studio. We'll 
run the numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 Pascal's hiring ended a lengthy search for an executive capable of functioning 
alongside Castle Rock and New Line management. One early candidate, Dawn Steel, 
declined the job in favor of a production deal at Turner with her husband, 
Charles Roven, and producer Robert Cavallo. 
</P>
<P>
 Pascal, who at Columbia was involved with such movies as "Awakenings" and 
"Groundhog Day," said she will make movies in the range of $15 million to $30 
million but has no mandate to fill a particular niche. She said Steel and her 
partners will be Turner's "main supplier." 
</P>
<P>
 Pascal will assemble a production staff from scratch. She will be on equal 
footing with Turner Pictures President Dennis Miller. Miller will continue to 
focus on Turner cable movies, feature animation and the Turner library. Both 
will report to Sassa.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; BIG-TICKET FACTORY ORDERS DIVE 4.2%; ECONOMY: JULY PLUNGE IN 
DURABLE GOODS IS RESULT OF INTEREST RATE INCREASES, SOME ANALYSTS SAY. OTHERS 
CALL DROP AN ABERRATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orders for big-ticket factory products took their steepest dive in 2 1/2 years 
in July, the government said Wednesday in a report that many analysts viewed as 
a sign that the Federal Reserve Board's interest rate increases are beginning 
to pinch. 
</P>
<P>
 The Commerce Department reported that orders for durable goods -- covering 
everything from bicycles to tanks -- plunged 4.2% last month following gains of 
1.2% in June and 1.4% in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts insisted that the falloff, which was far larger than expected, 
was a statistical aberration and not a sign that the manufacturing recovery was 
about to be derailed. 
</P>
<P>
 They noted that more than half the drop occurred because auto plants shut down 
production for two weeks in July for their annual retooling for the new model 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 But other analysts said the weakness went far beyond autos, with declines 
widespread in virtually every sector. They said it was strong evidence that the 
Fed's rate increases, intended to dampen inflationary pressures, were beginning 
to have an impact in slowing the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The consumer, housing and industrial sectors have all gotten off to a weak 
start this quarter," said Bruce Steinberg, an economist at Merrill Lynch in New 
York. "The Fed wanted to slow the economy to a more sustainable pace of growth, 
and they are in the process of doing that." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg said Wednesday's report on factory demand, coupled with the other 
signs of weakness, will cause him to revise downward even further his forecast 
for growth in the current July-September quarter. He said his new forecast will 
be perhaps half the nearly 4% turned in during the first six months of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert D. Barr, an economist at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce who has been 
critical of the Fed's rate increases, said the slowdown in manufacturing called 
into question last week's half-point increase in two key interest rates, the 
fifth rate increase this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Barr said the economy is slowing "in the face of higher interest rates, lower 
personal income growth and a buildup in inventories." 
</P>
<P>
 But the Clinton Administration dismissed fears that the recovery is in danger 
of stalling. Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown said it would be "silly" to 
draw too many conclusions from a single economic report. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our view is that the economy's in good shape. The growth rate is what we 
predicted it to be and what we'd like it to be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other analysts agreed that it would be wrong to read too much into the July 
decline in manufacturing orders. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an aberration because of all the statistical noise, and we will have 
to wait until August to get a true picture of what is going on," said Robert 
Dederick, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. "The shutdowns in 
July seriously distorted the picture." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts noted that even with the July setback, the largest drop since a 5.4% 
plunge in December, 1991, durable goods orders were still up a strong 13.3% 
from their level a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said the numerous signs of slowdown should ensure that the Fed's 
Aug. 16 rate increases will be the last for a while, at least until 
mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
 For July, durable goods orders totaled $144.87 billion, a drop of $6.38 
billion from the June level. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation orders fell 15.8%, reflecting not only the shutdown at auto 
plants but also declines in demand for aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense orders fell 16.4% in July, and non-defense capital goods, considered a 
good barometer of industry plans to expand production facilities, fell by 5.3% 
after having posted a strong 7.4% rise the month before. 
</P>
<P>
 Orders for primary metals such as steel were down 0.8%, and demand for 
industrial machinery was off 1.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 The only major category to show an increase was electronic equipment, which 
posted a gain of 0.8%.

SHAKE-UP AT DISNEY; CO-PILOTS OF THE NEXT STUDIO ERA; PROFILE: JOE ROTH; 
MAVERICK CO-FOUNDER OF MORGAN CREEK IS NO STRANGER TO EISNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Though he broke into the business as the maverick co-founder of independent 
Morgan Creek Productions, Joe Roth is no newcomer to Hollywood's 
rough-and-tumble corporate world. For more than three years, he sat in Darryl 
F. Zanuck's old office as the chairman of 20th Century Fox. A former director 
and producer, he was one of Hollywood's only filmmakers to assume the post of 
studio chief before starting Caravan Pictures at Disney nearly two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth, a smooth-spoken and respected veteran of the Hollywood community, was 
seen by some as the likely heir to studio Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg as soon 
as he took the Caravan job, because of his friendship with Walt Disney Co. 
Chairman Michael D. Eisner. But not until Wednesday morning, when Roth was 
walking on the beach with his wife, did the call from Eisner come through. 
"Nothing like this is ever undertaken without conflict," the 46-year-old Roth 
said Wednesday. "But my decision was pretty clear. I'd just come back from 
vacation and realized I was missing a lot. I miss being involved in the 
distribution and marketing of a large slate of films. I miss the breadth of the 
studio chief job." 
</P>
<P>
 A startled movie industry responded positively. "Joe brings both executive 
experience and a creative background to the job," notes Frank Price, chairman 
of Price Entertainment and former studio chief of Columbia Pictures and 
Universal Pictures. "As a former director and producer, he's got great talent 
relationships and tremendous insight into movie making." 
</P>
<P>
 Roth, whose Morgan Creek turned out such hits as "Major League" and "Young 
Guns," led Fox to the two most profitable years in its history. Spurred by the 
astronomical success of "Home Alone," the studio released "Die Hard 2," 
"Sleeping With the Enemy" and "White Men Can't Jump" under his reign. 
</P>
<P>
 Roth also had his share of box office failures, including "For the Boys" and 
"Shining Through." 
</P>
<P>
 The track record at Caravan Pictures, which will now be overseen by Roth's 
partner Roger Birnbaum, is also mixed. Only "The Three Musketeers" and "Angels 
in the Outfield" performed respectably. "Angie" and "I Love Trouble" proved to 
be major box office disappointments. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Universal chief Tom Pollock suggests that the differences between 
Katzenberg and Roth will be more stylistic than substantive, Roth points out 
that the job has been tailored a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Eisner that I wanted to do this job as a 'movie person' -- developing 
material, putting movies together," he explains. "I'm not giving up the 
creative part . . . I'm just bringing it into a new realm. Jeffrey and I are 
different people and I won't be inheriting the same job he had." He added: "I'm 
not being asked to do anything I haven't done -- seeking out material and 
talented people to work with it."

SHAKE-UP AT DISNEY; CO-PILOTS OF THE NEXT STUDIO ERA; PROFILE: RICHARD FRANK; 
TAKING OVER THE HUGELY PROFITABLE TV DIVISION HE BUILT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Richard Frank, the new chairman of Disney Television & Telecommunications, has 
never received the public attention given Jeffrey Katzenberg, the outgoing 
chairman. But Frank is highly respected within the industry as having helped 
build an enormously profitable TV business for Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, under the reorganization of Walt Disney Studios, Frank will have 
responsibility for an estimated 80% of the studio's $4.5 billion in revenue. 
His duties encompass everything from TV to home video to Disney's nascent 
telecommunications operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Walt Disney Studios as a concept no longer exists," Frank said. "That was 
a concept that was good 10 years ago when we all came here, but the world has 
changed drastically. There's a new world out there, which is the production and 
distribution of electronic software in all the different media coming to the 
fore." 
</P>
<P>
 At Disney, Frank has become the studio's resident guru on new-media 
technology. He was the principal organizer of this year's "superhighway summit 
conference" at UCLA, which attracted an all-star cast of Hollywood players and 
Vice President Al Gore. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank has long felt that the public does not appreciate the role TV has played 
in Hollywood's bottom line. In a recent speech to Hollywood publicists, he 
called on them to overcome their inferiority complex and trumpet the medium's 
achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney TV, essentially dormant when Frank took the reins in 1985, now produces 
32 hours of programming each week, from top-rated "Home Improvement" to "Bill 
Nye the Science Guy" on cable. He got Disney back into the television business 
the old-fashioned way: He spent lavishly. In the early 1990s, Disney had to 
build its stable of TV writers and producers from scratch and, along with 
Columbia Pictures, became known as the home of the multimillion-dollar deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank's gambit, unlike Columbia's, paid off: The syndication revenue alone 
from "Home Improvement" -- more than $600 million -- will cover the studio's TV 
overhead for years. 
</P>
<P>
 The studio's other hits -- helped in no small measure by the production duo of 
Paul Witt and Tony Thomas-Harris -- have included "Empty Nest" and "The Golden 
Girls." Disney also became a force in syndication, whisking away "Siskel & 
Ebert" from public TV and introducing "Live With Regis & Kathie Lee" 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 A former general manager of KCOP-TV (Channel 13), Frank came up on the station 
side of the business, working in ad sales and marketing. In 1977, he moved to 
Paramount to head that studio's syndication division and was joined there by 
his cousin Randy Reiss. Reiss later moved with Frank to Disney, where he now 
oversees KCAL-TV.

PROFILE; INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS; MASTER DEAL MAKER SCORES ANOTHER COUP WITH 
CANADIAN BUY; ACQUISITIONS: PETER MUNK'S PURCHASE OF LAC MINERALS COULD CREATE 
THE LARGEST GOLD MINING FIRM IN THE WORLD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fifty years ago, Peter Munk and his family were safely spirited out of 
German-occupied Budapest after his grandfather cut a deal with the Nazis. 
</P>
<P>
 The past few months prove that the young Munk learned the lessons of his 
banker grandfather well. 
</P>
<P>
 The urbane Hungarian, now 66, is one of the slickest deal makers in North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the man behind the dual stellar fortunes of Horsham Corp., named after 
the English hometown of his wife, Melanie, and American Barrick Resources Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had plenty of good luck. But you name me somebody who can build $8 billion 
worth of value in 10 years who says he's had no luck and I'll show you a liar," 
Munk said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrick's stock has shot up nearly 600% since 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after snapping North America's biggest public real estate company up out 
of court protection in a headline-grabbing deal, Munk has apparently won one of 
the biggest Canadian gold miners. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Lac Minerals said its board agreed to American Barrick's 
sweetened $1.62-billion takeover bid. Combined, the two Canadian gold miners 
are expected to rival South African companies as the largest in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Lac, which had been fighting to stay independent, agreed to the sweetened 
offer from Barrick even though it was less than a rival bid by upstart Royal 
Oak Mines Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal Oak launched the takeover battle in July with a bold attempt to gobble 
up Lac, a company four times its size. American Barrick initially offered $1.5 
billion. Royal Oak was offering $1.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 American Barrick's higher-quality assets, more liquid shares and strong cash 
position apparently proved more attractive to Lac shareholders, many of whom 
are institutional investors, than did aspects of the Royal Oak bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last month, Munk's Horsham and Argo Partnership closed the acquisition of 
68.5% of troubled real estate player Trizec Corp., which had been struggling to 
restructure $1.45 billion of debt, for $797 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal left Munk "exhilarated," he said, but he quickly moved on to his next 
target, locking horns with Royal Oak and its controversial chief executive, 
Margaret Witte, for control of Lac. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrick was touted back in 1989 as a possible suitor for Lac, with its rich 
treasury and under-performing stock. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were interested (in 1989), but Goldstrike became so overly important . . . 
We didn't want to do two things at once," Munk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrick's most important deal was the purchase of the Goldstrike property in 
Nevada from Pancana Minerals and Western States for $62 million -- a price many 
analysts jeered at as far too high at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstrike soon became a bonanza and the mainstay of Barrick's spectacular 
growth. But Lac would be a welcome addition to the Barrick stable since 
Goldstrike is maturing. 
</P>
<P>
 Munk has often been called a man with a Midas touch -- he has been on a roll 
for decades despite a couple of dramatic failures early in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 He came to Canada in 1948 at the invitation of his uncle, earned an electrical 
engineering degree from the University of Toronto and has spent most of his 
business life here. 
</P>
<P>
 But many of his involvements have been international and occasionally somewhat 
dubious. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1969, Munk and college friend David Gilmour set up an international hotel 
company, South Pacific Properties Ltd., whose properties eventually comprised 
the biggest string of hotels in the Pacific, from Fiji and Tahiti to Australia 
and New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1974, SPP set up a joint venture with the Egyptian government to build a 
giant resort next to the pyramids. One of those backstopping the project was 
arms dealer Adnan Khashoggi. 
</P>
<P>
 Egyptian President Anwar Sadat slammed the doors shut on the deal in 1978. 
Munk's next venture, American Barrick, was a much sounder bet. 
</P>
<P>
 With all its mines, including the spectacular Goldstrike, Barrick now sits on 
the largest gold reserves in North America. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Horsham, the holding and investment umbrella of Munk's empire, has 
shaken up St. Louis-based Clark Refining & Marketing Corp. and bought real 
estate near Berlin, Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Barrick grew through acquisition and sharp management from a foundering oil 
and natural gas company into one of the biggest gold producers in North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 Lac would give Barrick a strong foothold in Latin America, and Munk said he is 
looking to Asia for a third major geographic area.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; RECLAIM THOSE TAXING EUROPEAN 
TRAVEL EXPENSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL SMITH 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most business travel expenditures are just that -- expended and gone. Now, 
however, a growing number of companies are applying to get some of the money 
they spend on international travel refunded through value-added-tax reclaim 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Value-added tax, known as VAT, is essentially a sales tax on various products 
and services typically used by executives traveling in Europe. The categories 
for which VAT can be recovered include such products and services as car 
rentals, hotels, transportation, fuel, exhibition booths and display materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the taxes vary from about 3% to 25%, the average VAT paid by U.S. 
companies is about 15%, said Sherri Schick, district manager for New York-based 
Meridian VAT Reclaim, one of the country's largest companies that handle VAT 
claims. That means, on average, companies can recoup about 15% of their 
European travel expenditures in recoverable categories by filing VAT claims, 
Schick said. 
</P>
<P>
 American companies paid about $600 million in recoverable VAT last year, but 
because many companies didn't file the necessary paperwork, they recaptured 
less than $200 million of that, according to ITS Fabry Inc., a French reclaim 
service that is collaborating with Diners Club on a new VAT recovery program 
for Diners Club cardholders. 
</P>
<P>
 That unclaimed $400 million has attracted the attention of corporate cost 
cutters. 
</P>
<P>
 "More and more companies are doing VAT reclaim because people are looking for 
any way they can to contribute to the bottom line," Schick said.  
</P>
<P>
 In theory, companies have been entitled to get this tax money back since 1988, 
when the European Economic Community passed a directive allowing the VAT refund 
for foreign companies. Generally, U.S.-based companies that do not have branch 
offices in the host countries are eligible to file a VAT claim to get the money 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, however, getting VAT money back has been such a complicated 
ordeal that many companies have written it off as not worth the time and 
effort. Laws covering VAT claims are constantly changing, the procedures for 
filing a claim vary widely, the amount of recoverable VAT in each category is 
different from country to country, and the countries themselves are sometimes 
fickle in how they process the claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "You might have your claim rejected because the receipts were (facing) the 
wrong direction," Schick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, there are a growing number of firms specializing in helping 
companies recover VAT money. At the National Business Travel Assn.'s annual 
convention in Los Angeles last month, several booths were devoted to VAT 
reclaim efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "VAT (reclamation) can be very cumbersome," said Walter Sanders, spokesman for 
Diners Club, which last month launched a VAT recovery service for its corporate 
card members. 
</P>
<P>
 For a company to make a claim, it must submit original receipts for all 
claimed items -- not just credit card records or photocopies -- and its 
traveling executives must file application forms before they leave the country 
in order to be eligible to get the money back. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Most business executives are pulling a sprint through the airport at that 
point," Sanders said. "They aren't thinking about VAT." As a result, many 
companies lack the proper documentation to make a claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Reclaim services help companies set up systems for capturing the necessary 
documentation, train business travelers on proper exit procedures to make sure 
they can later make a claim and then take care of making the actual claims for 
the companies. Such services usually take a percentage of the money recovered. 
The percentage charged to the client varies according to how complicated the 
claim is, Schick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, there is a considerable amount of money at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Travelex, a London-based VAT reclaim service, estimates that if a 
company spends $200,000 in business travel to Europe -- not including air fares 
-- $150,000 of that would be eligible for tax recovery. Assuming an average VAT 
tax of 15%, the company would get back $22,500 in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Actual amounts recovered vary according to where the company travels and what 
types of expenses it has, Schick said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Britain, for example, the recoverable tax is 17.5% on hotels, exhibition 
expenses, staff meals, rental cars, gas and training courses. Germany allows 
companies to recover its 15% VAT for the same categories. Denmark has some of 
the highest recoverable VAT taxes, levying 25% on exhibition costs, training 
courses and fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But at the same time, it allows no recovery on taxes paid for hotels, car 
rentals or meals. Recoverable VAT taxes in Luxembourg are lower: 6% for 
exhibition expenses and 3% for hotels. The recoverable VAT on rental cars, gas 
and training costs is 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 The variation among countries also extends to the length of time it takes to 
process a claim and how far back claims can be made. Currently Belgium, Denmark 
and the Netherlands allow claims retroactive to five years, Schick said. For 
Germany it's three years, and everywhere else it's one year. Most claims take 
between six months and a year to process, she said. How Much Can You Get Back? 
</P>

be reimbursed for common business travel expenses. The -- symbol indicates

 Long one of the world's poorest countries, Bangladesh appeared to be making 
substantial economic improvements in the mid-1980s. But the 1990 Persian Gulf 
War was a major setback, costing about half a billion dollars in remittances 
from Bangladesh workers employed in Kuwait and export earnings from Kuwait and 
Iraq.

 India to Allow Foreign Firms Majority Ownership: Prime Minister P.V. Narasimha 
Rao, reviving stalled economic reforms, has approved a medical drug policy 
allowing a majority stake for foreign firms and easing price controls, 
officials said. The new policy requires confirmation by a Cabinet committee on 
economic affairs before it comes into effect, but that is considered a 
formality, the officials said. The pharmaceuticals industry was one of the key 
sectors still under government control since Rao launched a radical economic 
liberalization program in 1991.

failure in January set off a national banking crisis.Banco Provincial said it 
has acquired Banco Latino NV, the offshore unit of Banco Latino in Curacao.

ORANGE COUNTY BRIEFLY: 6 EX-EMPLOYEES SUE TOP VALU/VALU PLUS STORES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Six former employees of Top Valu/Valu Plus grocery stores filed a class-action 
lawsuit Wednesday against the company alleging that it violated overtime, 
minimum wage and other labor regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit and an accompanying statement allege that more than 1,000 current and 
past employees at 13 Top Valu/Valu Plus stores in Southern California were 
subjected to labor violations.The suit seeks back wages and penalties plus 
attorney fees and court costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Top Valu/Valu Plus is owned by K.V. Mart Co. of Long Beach. The company had no 
immediate response to the suit, which was filed Wednesday afternoon in Los 
Angeles Superior Court. Rick Eiden, director of organizing at the United Food 
and Commercial Workers Local 324 in Buena Park, which helped the former 
employees prepare the lawsuit, accused K.V. Mart of gaining a competitive 
advantage by shortchanging its employees, most of whom are Latinos.

THE SKYLINE'S PAR FOR THIS GOLF COURSE; SPORTS: PLAYERS TEE OFF AMID CHICAGO'S 
HIGH-RISES AT THE NATION'S FIRST CENTER-CITY LINKS. 
</P>

 Like a lot of businessmen, Steven Swinder brings his golf clubs and a change 
of clothes to work. Unlike a lot of others, he doesn't have to go very far to 
use them. 
</P>
<P>
 Three blocks away from his office is the country's first center-city golf 
course, nestled between traffic jams and a world-class skyline. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take a cellular phone, and I'm only five minutes from the office," Swinder, 
an accountant, said Tuesday as he waited with attorney Mark Liss for their 5 
p.m. tee time at Illinois Center Golf. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-hole, par-27 public course opened Sunday. It has been crowded in late 
afternoons with golfers who pay $22 for a 70-minute round or $9 to hit a bucket 
of balls on the driving range -- high fees by Chicago standards for comparable 
courses. 
</P>
<P>
 The course, in a former rail yard along the Lake Michigan shore, is a mere 
five-minute stroll from crowded Michigan Avenue. Though open to the sky, it's 
surrounded by the foundations of buildings and elevated streets. 
</P>
<P>
 The fairways are lush, with tricky greens -- No. 9 is surrounded by water and 
reached by a bridge -- and sneaky hidden sand traps. The holes range from 57 to 
145 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic noise is a distraction -- someone with a bad slice could smash a 
windshield on Lower Wacker Drive -- but the spectacular skyline views from the 
fifth, sixth and eighth tees are pleasant diversions. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is pretty nice," said Mark Monoscalco, gazing at the spread of 
architecture from the Sears Tower to the John Hancock Building. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no reason for me not to become a better golfer now," said Monoscalco, 
a self-employed computer consultant who took the afternoon off to try the new 
course. "I can come over here, play a round, and still get back in time to 
return calls." 
</P>
<P>
 The course is across the street from the 80-story Amoco Building and within 
250 yards of at least one large hotel -- in range of a long drive, though 
players probably would not use a driver on this course. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swissotel Chicago, with glittering glass walls rising for 43 stories just 
beyond the ninth hole, is not worried about ball damage and sees its proximity 
to the course as a plus, particularly for attracting golf-loving Japanese 
guests. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's cheap compared to what they have to pay" in Japan, hotel spokesman 
Robert Allegrini said. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Golf Assn. said it knew of no other urban golf courses as close to a 
downtown business district.

SPECULATION TAKES TOLL ON BODY SHOP'S CLEAN IMAGE; STOCKS: THE COMPANY'S SHARES 
PLUNGE FOLLOWING RUMORS ABOUT UPCOMING ARTICLES QUESTIONING ITS ETHICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIRK BEVERIDGE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rumors of impending bad news have become bad news for the Body Shop, whose 
stock has plunged nearly 10% amid speculation that its environmentally 
conscious image is about to suffer an attack in America. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale of stock in the cosmetics and toiletry chain, which markets itself as 
ethically and environmentally responsible, was reportedly prompted by upcoming 
U.S. articles that criticize the Body Shop's ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 Body Shop Chairman Gordon Roddick acknowledged Wednesday that one incident 
mentioned in the press recently -- a 30-gallon spill of Fuzzy Peach Shower Gel 
in New Jersey -- had occurred. But he called the rest of the ruckus "nonsense 
being created by the zealots of cynicism." 
</P>
<P>
 "They are determined to blow trivia and day-to-day events out of all 
proportion, and to feed a story based on rumor and innuendo," Roddick said. The 
Body Shop International PLC is not perfect but is "proud of our record and 
proud of what we do." 
</P>
<P>
 This coverage indicates how financial markets can go wild when speculation 
begins feeding on itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The Body Shop's trial by headline began last Friday, when the Financial Times, 
London's daily business newspaper, led its Companies and Markets section with a 
story entitled "U.S. ethical fund turns against Body Shop." 
</P>
<P>
 The story said that the ethical investment fund, Franklin Research and 
Development Corp., unloaded 50,000 shares of Body Shop, amid concerns that 
upcoming criticism of the company would hammer the stock price. 
</P>
<P>
 Since that story appeared, Body Shop stock plunged 9.5% from 242 pence, or 
$3.63 a share, to close at 219 pence, or $3.28 a share, in London on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The story said Franklin Research would soon "provide a more detailed article 
on the company in a newsletter" and that its decision to bail out of Body Shop 
stock was based on information it has seen in a draft article to be published 
soon in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The article in question is scheduled to appear Sept. 1 in Business Ethics, a 
specialist magazine based in Minneapolis that insisted Wednesday it has not 
revealed to anyone the contents of an upcoming feature on the Body Shop. 
</P>
<P>
 The Body Shop's environmental stance brings intense scrutiny from a variety of 
investment funds that keep tabs on the business practices of companies they 
invest in. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior vice president of Franklin Research, Patrick McVeigh, says in a 
letter appearing in Wednesday's editions of the Financial Times that the 
newspaper was off base in suggesting his group has "turned against" the Body 
Shop.

AIRLINE HAS JUST THE TICKET FOR BLAHS IN INDIANAPOLIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anywhere but here. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the sentiment among the more than 1,500 people who lined up Wednesday 
hoping to leave Indianapolis this weekend with one of Northwest Airlines' 
"Mystery Fares." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really care where I go, I just need a break," said Diana Whitsett of 
Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 The round-trip tickets for one-day trips to various cities went on sale at 11 
a.m. for $59 each or $99 per couple, on a first-come, first-served basis. The 
catch is that travelers won't learn which cities they will visit until they 
arrive at Indianapolis International Airport on Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Abner of Edinburgh, about 25 miles south of the airport, set up camp at 3 
a.m. to be first in line. The eight-hour wait paid off with six tickets to 
somewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter where we go, we'll take it and we'll enjoy it," Abner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 300 tickets, which could be bought in blocks of up to six, sold out in an 
hour and 45 minutes, said Northwest spokesman Jim Faulkner. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers were given vouchers to bring with them when they return to the 
airport at 5:30 a.m. Saturday. Most of the travelers will return to 
Indianapolis by 11 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The travelers' mystery destinations include Northwest's three domestic hubs in 
Detroit, Minneapolis and Memphis, Tenn. Flights to the remaining 12 cities 
connect at the hubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwest wouldn't reveal the 15 destinations, but the airline said New 
Orleans, Philadelphia and Buffalo are among them. 
</P>
<P>
 Northwest passed out coupons worth $35, or $50 off future ticket purchases, to 
those who waited in line but didn't receive one of the tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 It was obvious to late arrivals that the tickets would be gone long before 
they worked their way through the line, which snaked its way from the ticket 
counter down an escalator and around a baggage area. 
</P>
<P>
 Once they saw the line, some turned and left. One hopeful traveler, Jason 
Wright, lurked near the front of the line trying to strike a deal with early 
arrivals to give up their seats. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just have to get out of Indianapolis for one day," said Wright, who 
eventually purchased four vouchers for $290 from a couple who had arrived at 7 
a.m.

AIRING YOUR VIEWS; WANT TO GET SOMETHING OFF YOUR CHEST PUT IT ON A T-SHIRT 
</P>

 People are wearing their hearts on their sleeves, or rather their fronts and 
backs, by sporting T-shirts with political, economic of likestyle messages. 
Instead of designer names, these shirts offer pithy observations about life or 
promote a cause, from saving the dolphins to fighting AIDS. They're the 
equivalent of a fashion sound bite. 
</P>
<P>
 Earth Crisis, a nonprofit network of artists in Irvine, has used T-shirts to 
foster awareness of environmental and social issues. Money raised from sales of 
the shirts goes to organizations such as Greenpeace and youth shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 To quote its T-shirt: "Education is Free. Ignorance is Costly," "Exxon Don't 
Surf" (a commentary on the Exxon Valdez oil spill That is still a hot seller, 
Forever," which has a picture of a black rhino or a white tiger. The "Danger 
Contaminated Water" shirts protest against ocean pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get the message across in a bolder, more visual way," says Mark Sperling, 
one of the artists who handles marketing for the group. "The shirts are made 
for couch potatoes who want to do something but don't want to chain themselves 
to a tree. We call them closet activists." 
</P>
<P>
 One line of T-shirts produced by Earth Crisis benefits Art for Life's Sake, an 
AIDS prevention campaign founded by Earth Crisis artist Mark Smith, whose 
brother tested positive for HIV several years ago. Smith created an AIDS 
prevention logo featuring a circle with a dot symbolizing the disease and a 
line drawn through the middle to indicate prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 "T-shirts are a great medium to get the message out," Smith says. Whether 
they're shopping or going to the movies, people wearing shirts with his AIDS 
symbol become like moving billboards. 
</P>
<P>
 Earth Crisis T-shirts, made of recycled cotton and equipped with tags that 
offer recycling tips, sell for around $18 in 50 stores around the country, 
including Elements in Irvine, and through a mail-order catalogue (available by 
calling (714) 646-2368). 
</P>
<P>
 The Surfrider Foundation in San Clemente, a nonprofit ocean conservation 
organization, uses T-shirts -- the preferred uniform of surfers -- to spread 
the message of ocean preservation while raising money for its cause. 
</P>
<P>
 While they look like typical surfer T-shirts complete with wave and surfboard 
graphics, these Ts -- with slogans such as "Respect the Beach," "Sea the 
Beauty" and "Keepers of the Coast" -- promote the ocean instead of a surfwear 
manufacturer. The shirts are available for about $16 at surf shops and mail 
order by calling (714) 492-0257. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmental causes are a favorite of T-shirts at Mother's Market & Kitchen 
in Costa Mesa and Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The shirts (about $10 to $20) have save-the-Earth slogans such as "Respect 
Your Mother" (with an illustration of a globe), "Let Them Live Wild and Free" 
(accompanied by a picture of timber wolves) and "Wild About Organic."  
</P>
<P>
 "People want them to express a consciousness," says Jessica Wharton, 
department manager of Mother's Market in Costa Mesa. "They want to show their 
beliefs." 
</P>
<P>
 There's virtually no topic -- politics, sex or religion -- that can't be 
condensed onto a T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Christian messages that tackle everything from abortion to pop psychology can 
be found on T-shirts at the Celebration Christian Bookstore in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the shirts mimic the surfer shirts, with earthy colors and bold logos, 
but they deal with religious issues. One shirt has an illustration of the 
Crucifixion with the saying, "If I'm OK and you're OK, explain this." 
Anti-abortion slogans and Scripture passages are popular as well. The shirts 
sell for about $15. 
</P>
<P>
 As a mode of communication, T-shirts are especially suited to Southern 
Californians, whose short attention spans require an easy-to-digest medium, 
says Eric Casteel, manager of Celebration. People are bombarded with 
information in this TV age, and the philosophical blips encapsulated on 
T-shirts are short enough for them to absorb, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have the type of culture perfect for a message that fits on a T-shirt," 
Casteel says. 
</P>
<P>
 Like personalized license plates, the shirts also appeal to the individual's 
desire to stand out from the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes "the only thing that can set you apart is your clothes," he says. 
"It's easier to make yourself an individual by wearing something on a T-shirt." 
</P>
<P>
 For followers of New-Age thinking, T-shirts can be a way to connect with a 
soul mate, if not the universe. 
</P>
<P>
 "A T-shirt with a message attracts people of like mind. If you're into angels 
and you see someone with an angel T-shirt, you're attracted to that person," 
says Lorene Judd, manager of Visions & Dreams Emporium in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The shop carries T-shirts designed to get people thinking, with a simple word 
and symbol signifying metaphysical concepts such as "Infinity," "Clarity" or 
"Imagination." Each sells for $19.95. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're into fashion, it makes a statement. It's like a bumper sticker. 
You're putting out a message," Judd says. "Others will see a word like infinity 
and start to think about that. You're putting a positive vibration instead of a 
negative, violent one." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are T-shirts that make a statement against making statements. One 
such shirt comes with an illustration of a box and the word "Trendless" ($17), 
available at Elements in Irvine. Says salesman Tim Zakharov: 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got your grunge; you've got your rap. Everyone has to wear the right 
kind of clothes and the right kind of T-shirt. This is the answer to that."

OFF THE CUFF; WATCH IT! THERE'S NO PRESENT LIKE THE TIME

 Tick . . . tick . . . tick.

 David Banner pays attention to watches, from the pricey Audemars Piguet and 
Vacheron Constantin to the economical Swatch. As regional director of Tourneau, 
which has six stores that sell timepieces, including one in South Coast Plaza, 
he's an expert on Swiss watches.  
</P>
<P>
 Banner, who's certified as a gemologist by the Gemological Institute of 
America, started his career in his family jewelry business in Atlanta. He 
joined Tourneau three years ago because "I wanted to work for a leader, a 
60-year-old company committed to customer service and selection of outstanding 
products."  
</P>
<P>
 Also committed to making money -- Tourneau sells fine watches for as much as 
$550,000.  
</P>
<P>
 This is another in a series of first-person columns that allows people 
connected to the fashion industry to talk about their encounters.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a kid, I used to take watches apart, but I could never get them back 
together again. There were always a few extra parts. But I tinkered with 
watches because I was impressed with this engineering marvel -- inside that 
small case were a hairspring, a balance wheel and 200 more parts. 
</P>
<P>
 I own five or six watches. I'm never late. Right now I'm wearing an Audemars 
Piguet Royal Oak, which is a stainless steel and gold watch I've had for two 
years and I wear quite a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 The watch I wear depends on the mood I'm in. I also wear an Ebel Chronograph 
watch that's a little more sporty. But I don't have a favorite. Here, all our 
watches are our favorite, just like children. 
</P>
<P>
 Having more than one watch is one of the differences between watches today and 
50 years ago. Then, a watch was a necessity used to tell time so you wouldn't 
be late. Now it's an accessory and a collectible. It's a fashion, a form of 
jewelry, especially for men who don't wear much jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourneau is the leader in its field of luxury Swiss watches. We have more 
brands than any other watch store in the U.S. and an inventory of 25,000 
watches in our stores. 
</P>
<P>
 We appeal to many kinds of individuals, from those interested in purchasing a 
$40 Swatch to those wanting a half-million-dollar diamond watch. We carry 
antique watches, pocket watches, collectibles from the '40s and '50s, 
one-of-a-kind watches and Alain Silberstein watches, which are artistic, Andy 
Warhol-type pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 One watch that is coming out soon from the Breitling Co. will have a built-in 
antenna that will give off an SOS signal if you're stranded on a boat or if 
you're a pilot. But for the most part, new technology doesn't impact our 
selection because most of the watches we sell are made the way they were made 
in the 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
 The mechanical and automatic watches we sell show the true art of watchmaking. 
A mechanical watch is one you wind, and an automatic one is made with a 
mechanism that winds itself. We also sell quartz watches, but we've seen a 
resurgence in the appeal of Old-World automatics and mechanicals. 
</P>
<P>
 All of our watches are Swiss. The Swiss factories are only capable of 
producing a couple thousand watches a year, and, unfortunately, it's becoming a 
dying art. 
</P>
<P>
 It used to be a family business, where the grandfather, father and son all 
were watchmakers and knew the complicated production. But in 20 or 30 years, no 
one will be around to make these watches.

BEHING THE SCENES: TEMPTATION IN THE GARDEN OF ESCADA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 100 Escada devotees took a lighthearted tour through the Secret 
Garden with a woman's best friend -- the Dalmatian -- last Wednesday during a 
private preview of the fall collection and luncheon at the Ritz restaurant in 
Newport Beach for Club 39, a women's social group. 
</P>
<P>
 The "garden" translated into argyles and plaids in emerald, forest and lime 
with a shot of navy or black.The collection from the Escada Boutique in South 
Coast Plaza, was reminiscent of mod days in the English countryside, complete 
with driver caps.  
</P>
<P>
 Escada designer Michael Stolzenburg then revealed his whimsical side with his 
Top Pedigree line of clothes. Glen plaids were stomped all over with paw 
prints, and blouses and sweaters got the Dalmatian spot treatment. What wasn't 
black and white all over was a gorgeous cobalt blue. Even leather pieces within 
the series have been stitched blue. 
</P>
<P>
 Silhouettes balanced classic with a modern spin: short swing skirts (but not 
too mini) -- some with carwash cuts; jackets elongated and belted at the waist, 
narrow trousers and dresses. Stolzenburg, chief designer for the Munich-based 
company since 1992, proved again that he's willing to take risks by including a 
cropped jacket in shiny vinyl and a pattern play of plaids and argyles. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, overall the collection remains true to the sartorial needs of the 
well-dressed, well-heeled women who have long embraced the Escada tradition.

 Glamour design diva Sandra Harvey of Costa Mesa rides the Orient Express into 
fall with her Suzy Wong collection of brocade vests, mandarin dresses and gowns 
hand-painted with Chinese motifs. This last category will feature her signature 
silk charmeuse slips brushed by Andrew Nesselrod, a local artist whom Harvey 
says took her 10 years to find. "I've gone through three other artists, and 
none of them could put my vision on fabric like Andy," she says. The intricate 
delicacy of Nesselrod's work gives the dresses a quality of vintage couture -- 
falling right in line with Harvey's ongoing fascination with the sultry and 
seductive '20s. Each one-of-a-kind gown sells for $500. Her Newport Boulevard 
store will soon have a cousin in New York, when another Sandra Harvey Boutique 
opens in SoHo later this year, as well as a Dagger, a house fragrance with a 
sweetly intoxicating but dangerous scent. Chrome Dome

 Clothes and jewelry are not the only things enjoying a sterling year. Hair is 
getting a silver touch, with a blue-gray tint washing over blondes and 
brunettes, according to Clay Wilson of the Doyle Wilson Salon on Melrose. Too 
Leisure World, you say? Or maybe too futuristic? "Our motto is if we wanted it 
natural we'd leave it alone," says Wilson, one of Los Angeles' top colorists 
and the '93 North American hairstylist of the year. Consider the modernity of a 
short cut with the silverish tint. These flatter, metallic shades work better 
with this season's bright and silver fashions, says Wilson, versus hair colored 
with warmer oranges, reds or browns, which can compete and clash. It also works 
better with the "hardware" trend, adds Wilson. Hardware refers to the metal 
barrettes and hair clips, as well as the more severe shapes, once again in 
style. Heaven Scent

 As if he didn't have enough to do designing for Fendi, Chloe, Chanel and his 
signature collection of clothes, Karl Lagerfeld reaches for the heavens with 
the addition of Sun Moon Stars to his fragrance collection. It's the fourth for 
the Kaiser of couture, who introduced his first, Chloe, in 1975. A voluptuous 
bouquet of notes includes living peach, mandarin, waterlily, white cloud rose, 
heliotrope, jasmine, sandalwood, amber and musk, among others. The frosted, 
moonlight blue bottle is covered by the sun, moon and stars and crowned by a 
gold stopper. The line ranges from $200 for one ounce of parfum to $37 for 1.7 
ounces of eau de toilette spray to $25 for the perfumed bath gel. The reel 
stars enlisted for the ethereal, fairy-tale print and TV campaign: actress 
Daryl Hannah, fashion photographer Peter Lindbergh and film director David 
Lynch -- all characterized in one way or another as other-than-of-this-Earth. 
Inquiring noses will have to wait until early September, when the line hits 
perfume counters. ROSE APODACA JONES

OUT-OF-THE-CLOSET ENTREPRENEURSHIP SUITS THIS HUMORIST TO A T; STATEMENT: THE 
DON'T PANIC COMPANY'S SLOGANS PROMOTE PRIDE, UNITY AND ACTIVISM, BUT THEY'RE 
NOT POPULAR WITH EVERYONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The slogan on Skyler Thomas' chest says it all: "I Can't Even Think Straight." 
</P>
<P>
 Since early 1990, when he conceived a line of T-shirts with such in-your-face 
commentary as "Nobody Knows I'm Gay," "What a Difference a Gay Makes" and 
"Closets Are for Clothes," the 30-year-old humorist has been out of breath. 
</P>
<P>
 In four years, the Culver City company he calls Don't Panic has evolved into a 
thriving $2.5-million business that includes a wholesale operation, a 
mail-order catalogue ((800) 45-PANIC), six retail stores (West Hollywood, New 
York, Miami Beach, San Francisco, Provincetown, Pa., and the Soho district of 
London), as well as distribution through Coach House Gifts in the Laguna Hills 
Mall and Mall of Orange and G-Mart in Laguna Beach. Although many gay men and 
lesbians quickly embraced Thomas' ideology and began wearing his Ts as a symbol 
of unity and pride, others -- straight and gay -- balked at the blatant 
messages. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are certainly on the borderline of being obnoxious," Thomas concedes. 
"Even some gay people aren't sure if they like them." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those critics argue that advertising one's sexual orientation in a 
world riddled with gay bashing is dangerous. Thomas agrees that "people have to 
be wise about what they wear and where they wear it," but he also says his 
clothing can help defuse gay stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a certain number of people out there who are just homophobic by 
default," he says. "They've never had to decide how to deal with homosexuals 
because they haven't had anybody who was outwardly gay in their life. When 
those people see someone wearing one of my shirts, a lot of them just laugh (at 
the messages) and see that the person wearing it is not necessarily a freak. 
And in that moment the barriers are dissipated." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Thomas says it was never his intention to become a voice in the gay 
rights movement. More entrepreneur than activist, he hit upon the idea of doing 
T-shirts purely as a money-making scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came up with some gay themes because the L.A. Gay Pride Festival was coming 
up, and I thought I might get a booth," he recalls. After persuading a friend 
to loan him $6,000 for equipment, which he installed in the spare bedroom of 
his West Hollywood apartment, Thomas went to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I printed up 75 T-shirts, thinking that was either going to be too many or 
not enough." 
</P>
<P>
 He was back at his used printing press the same morning. "When I got home, I 
went through my closet and printed everything that was clean," Thomas says. 
</P>
<P>
 By weekend's end, he had sold 500 shirts and had recouped most of his 
investment. "It was really wild. People were going into stores asking if they 
had the 'Nobody Knows I'm Gay' shirts, and by the end of the festival the whole 
country knew about them." 
</P>
<P>
 Liza Minnelli was an early fan. Working on a difficult show in New York, the 
frazzled entertainer asked Thomas to print her a T-shirt that read "Don't 
Panic." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas ultimately took those words as his company name. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Within weeks of the gay pride festivities, stores with large gay followings 
began phoning in their orders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Skyler revolutionized the whole T-shirt thing," says Dennis Dashing, a buyer 
for Drake's on Melrose Avenue and Santa Monica Boulevard. "He put comedy behind 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas also managed to get some of his unisex shirts into such chain stores as 
Merry-Go-Round and Macy's Herald Square in New York. In fact, those and other 
similar stores account for 40% of the company's retail orders. 
</P>
<P>
 As the business has grown, so has its product mix. A glass Christmas tree 
ornament with an AIDS awareness ribbon dangling inside is a bestseller; a 
portion of the proceeds from its sales (nearly $200,000 to date) goes to 
Americans for AIDS Research (AmFAR). Other Don't Panic items include everything 
from OUTch! watches and "Bad Hair Day" baseball caps to coffee mugs, key 
chains, wallets, tote bags, beach towels, jewelry, temporary tattoos and metal 
AIDS awareness ribbons. 
</P>
<P>
 But 80% of the sales still come from Ts. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a generation of gay people who grew up with no outlets and no one to talk 
to about their gayness, the shirts have become a kind of identity thing," says 
Thomas, who has moved out of his apartment and into a rental house in West 
Hollywood. "They're a symbol of being part of something bigger than ourselves. 
They tell us it's OK to be gay. And that feels good."

WHAT AUTUMN WILL FEEL LIKE THIS YEAR; FABRICS: TOUCHABLE TEXTURES -- SUCH AS 
MOHAIR, FAKE FURS AND VELVET -- ARE IN FOR FALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Even as the late summer sun approaches melting point, fuzzy mohair sweaters 
and slick patent leather boots in department store windows signal cooler days 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have yet to tackle spring cleaning may find the approach of fall too 
much. But get a grip. Forget that mohair sounds itchy and patent sounds sticky 
and start thinking about plugging the gaps in your fall wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
 Touchable textures are important this season. So if you're itching to be 
stylish, grab a mohair sweater or skirt, a nubby boucle suit, a velvet A-line 
dress or a cuddly swing coat in shearling, real or faux. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything that feels great to the hand is selling," says Benny Lin, fashion 
director of Macy's in New York. "Like a cropped long-sleeved mohair cardigan or 
crew neck, preferably in ivory. Or a schoolgirlish tweed jumper in tones of 
gray, worn with a crisp white cotton shirt." 
</P>
<P>
 Early winners, Lin says, include vests and cropped pullovers in mohair such as 
those from Retango and Anna Sui. 
</P>
<P>
 Synthetics are also stylish. Plush, frankly fake furs in leopard, zebra and 
pony are doing well. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a wonderful Chanel black and white faux fur cropped jacket and 
matching hat that's selling, as well as a private-label black faux beaver vest 
with red trim," says Adrienne Hoyer, senior vice president for designer apparel 
at I. Magnin in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Super-shiny vinyl, with its bad-babe appeal, is fall's new leather. It's doing 
well in a range of clothing and accessories, from motorcycle jackets to mini 
backpacks. 
</P>
<P>
 And for a bit of evening glitz, shimmery metallic slip dresses are selling. 
</P>
<P>
 "The A-line slip dress plus T-shirt is a very important idea for both casual 
and social occasions," says Hope Brick, fashion director for Foley's in 
Houston. "What makes it new for fall is the addition of shine, in slick silver 
or gold, teamed with a georgette T-shirt." 
</P>
<P>
 Knee-length skirts look new at Calvin Klein and DKNY and are expected to give 
short and sassy skating skirts competition as the fashionable length of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Retailers say it's not that this mid-length is news but that top fashion 
houses find it appealing. 
</P>
<P>
 "What might seem advanced for the younger, trendier audience has always been a 
wardrobe mainstay for the bulk of our consumers," Brick says. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortie kilts in plaids and solids are doing well at Joslins in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're selling to those customers who like the concept of a fun, flirty 
skirt," says Christine Kern, Joslins' fashion coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaids go beyond kilts at Foley's. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have seen plaid pleated miniskirts begin to sell," Brick says, "and plaid 
backpacks have been selling phenomenally, as the handbag of the '90s. The 
tartan aspect makes a whole lot of sense for fall '94." 
</P>
<P>
 Color your plaids in shades of brown, which retailers are calling the new 
black. Or go for high-voltage hues either in plaids or plains. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're coming off of several seasons of non-colors," Brick says. "Now we're 
seeing a total surge in our business as it relates to color. We are 
anticipating that red will be one of the most important colors of fall. And hot 
brights are already selling." 
</P>
<P>
 Even pants in plaids and brights are considered in good taste if you have the 
figure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are selling true menswear-inspired trousers in tartans, houndstooth and 
windowpane," Brick says. "And women are finding that a pantsuit is a smart look 
this season." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackets continue as a major player, preferably one with a nipped waist, either 
cropped or long, says Hoyer of I. Magnin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anything colorful in a wool jacket is selling," she says. "It could be 
shocking pink or bright green or yellow. A lot of customers are viewing this as 
a way to perk up a wardrobe." 
</P>
<P>
 Footwear has its highs and lows. For those not up to teetering, flat patent 
leather Mary Janes are ready for another spin. Boots are mostly lower-heeled, 
too, ranging from knee-high riding boots to ankle-high shoe boots. 
</P>
<P>
 But what looks most modern is higher heels, even skinny stilettos. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something you must have this season," says Benny Lin of Macy's, "is a great 
new pair of high heels, preferably in black patent leather with a three-inch 
heel. 
</P>
<P>
 Are they selling? Yes. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Lin adds, "whether women will really wear them is another issue."

CLOSET RX; NAVY WOOL BLAZER IS STANDBY FOR A REASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's a point in every man's life when he realizes he has to grow up. This 
often happens when he shows up at an event in the same jacket he wore at his 
high school graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he may not need a rack full of sport coats and suits, having one or 
two that he can throw on with almost anything is a good idea. The problem is, 
if you're just going have one sport coat, which should it be? 
</P>
<P>
 The natural pick is that great old standby, the navy wool blazer. "It's 
probably one of the most versatile pieces of clothing you can own," says Bent 
Simonsen of Burberry's Ltd. in South Coast Plaza. "You can wear it to a job 
interview during the day with tan or gray slacks and a button-down shirt, then 
dress it down to go to a party that evening." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the classic blazer has brass buttons, one can get it with bone. "It's 
just a matter of preference," says Tom Fuller of Fuller's for Men and Women in 
Dana Point. "The bone buttons tend to go with a younger look, but if you feel 
like you need to look more traditional, try the brass." 
</P>
<P>
 If the salesperson asks whether you'd like a single or double, he or she is 
not talking ice cream cones. It's about whether you want a single- or 
double-breasted jacket, and each has its advantages. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was just going to own one sport coat, it would be single-breasted," 
Simonsen says. "It's a more conservative look that's always appropriate for job 
interviews. Get the more stylish double-breasted after you cash your first 
paycheck." 
</P>
<P>
 If you're think "stuffy" when you hear the word "classic" and you're afraid of 
looking like a member of the yacht club, there are options. The unconstructed 
jacket, with its wider shoulders, open pockets and relaxed fit, has become more 
acceptable. "The nicer jackets in silk or a silk blend are fine in most 
situations," Fuller says. 
</P>
<P>
 For a versatile jacket that's still on the "cutting edge," look for the crepe 
coat, a wool-blend blazer that doesn't have the straight, smooth fabric of a 
traditional gabardine. "It's not as rigid as the more traditional fabrics, and 
you can get (it) in a navy or black, which gives you great versatility," says 
Mark Schell of Mark Schell Designs for Men in Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 The crepe has a kind of draped appearance that looks dressier and neater than 
a summer linen jacket and yet sets you apart from those wearing the classic 
blazer. 
</P>
<P>
 And once you've made your choice, you're bound to get that sickening feeling, 
"Did I button it right?" On single-breasted jackets, it's the top button, 
unless you're sitting down, in which case it's left open. Double-breasted 
jackets always remain closed and buttoned.

BLACK WOMEN GET THEIR VOICES HEARD, FASHION NEEDS MET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIA H. DAVIS, THE HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeans that fit in the waist but not in the butt. Sleeves that aren't long 
enough. Suits that bunch up in the back. 
</P>
<P>
 These are some of the fashion misfitting problems black women have dealt with 
for years when buying clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Lori Scott was tired of spending a small fortune on alterations, and she knew 
many other black women were too. So Scott went to her employer, Spiegel, and 
pitched an idea: a clothing catalogue geared to the fit and fashion needs of 
black women. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegel went to Johnson Publishing Co., owner of Ebony magazine, and asked for 
its input on the project. The result was E Style. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott said the catalogue was a natural extension of the sizable black market 
that Spiegel, a Chicago-based catalogue company, has enjoyed for years. 
Research shows blacks spend more than $7.5 billion per year on fashions and 
accessories. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put what we call requests into magazines all the time where people can 
send them in and get the regular catalogues," she said. "I noticed that 
whenever there was a request in a black magazine like Ebony, three times as 
many more of the cards came back than any we put in mainstream magazines. I 
thought we should investigate that further." 
</P>
<P>
 The response to E Style has been overwhelming, said Ann Morris, media 
relations manager for Spiegel. The spring 1994 catalogue is the third such 
catalogue. Fall and holiday catalogues were mailed last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's doing very well," Morris said. "We've been getting a lot of positive 
feedback. Women like the selection and the way the catalogue looks. They like 
the fact that we're using different-looking models with different skin tones 
and hairstyles and the fact that we have career and casual looks, head-to-toe 
outfits completely coordinated with hats and shoes and everything." 
</P>
<P>
 E Style looks like any other catalogue, with work suits, shoes, underwear, 
jeans and other casual clothes. But it also offers shawls and jackets with 
accents of traditional African kente print and mud cloth, earrings with beads 
and cowrie shells, pins with African American faces and carved wooden 
ceremonial masks and Ashanti fertility dolls for the home. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices range from $79 for a Kente print bomber jacket and $22 for the matching 
hat to $282 for a geometric suit, matching straw hat and coordinating pumps. E 
Style clothing is available in misses' Sizes 8 to 18, and many outfits come in 
women's sizes as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Johnson Rice, president of Johnson Publishing, said part of the reason 
the catalogue has been so successful is because Spiegel did its research and 
asked black women what they wanted. The typical respondent said: 
</P>
<P>
 * She is more interested in head-to-toe outfits than add-to-your existing 
wardrobe basics. 
</P>
<P>
 * She wants a broader assortment of colors to flatter a variety of skin tones. 
Warm, vibrant sunburned shades such as cinnamon, red, gold, fuchsia, lime and 
royal blue are preferred to pale pastels. 
</P>
<P>
 * Hats are an important accessory for her -- dressier ones for church, more 
casual styles for weekends. Hats with the same fabric as a suit or dress, again 
for that head-to-toe look, also are popular. 
</P>
<P>
 * Clothes and accessories featuring ethnic fabrics and prints are desired to 
celebrate black heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegel also randomly measured about 1,300 black women for its research on how 
clothing should fit. Sixteen body points, including high hip, front and back 
waist and inseam, were measured and showed black women have distinct fit and 
proportion needs and prefer better tailored clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I believe they've come up with an excellent group of outfits," Rice said. 
"I mean, their jeans really fit. I don't know about you, but I've never been 
able to go into a store and buy a pair of jeans off the rack that fit 
perfectly. I don't know any African American woman who has, and that's a 
problem they've addressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Spiegel is not the only company that has decided to market to the black 
consumer. Just over a year ago, JCPenney began Fashion Influences, which 
includes Afrocentric items by designer Anthony Mark Hankins. 
</P>
<P>
 But Spiegel and JCPenney are almost a decade behind Essence magazine. The 
24-year-old publication for black women began selling Afrocentric clothing, 
accessories and home decorations by mail around 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Now other segments of the fashion industry are trying to fill the void. Almost 
three years ago major cosmetics companies, including Revlon, Clinique, 
Prescriptives and Maybelline, either extended their makeup lines to include 
more colors or developed whole new lines with shades and colors for the black, 
Latina, Asian and Native American woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The way Revlon has introduced its spring line of colors, Exotica, is an 
example of the way mainstream companies are responding to the ethnic market. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two lines of Exotica colors: ColorStyle, the company's line of 
makeup for black women, and classic Revlon, for everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 The company even used two different models in advertisements for Exotica. 
Supermodel Cindy Crawford models the classic Revlon line, while black model 
Veronica Webb shows the ColorStyle line. 
</P>
<P>
 Jadzia Zielinski, vice president of public relations for Revlon, said all the 
colors are based on fashion trends, but the ColorStyle line has different 
formulations for black women's skin. Revlon will launch future fall and spring 
lines this way. 
</P>
<P>
 The McCall Pattern Co. also has jumped on the ethnic-marketing bandwagon with 
a line of patterns for those who want to sew Afrocentric hats, stoles, shawls, 
tunics and caftans. The patterns were designed by Emeaba Emeaba, a Nigerian 
designer. 
</P>
<P>
 Mary Ann Villanueva, manager of public relations for the company, said that 
since the patterns were introduced in August, they have consistently been 
included on the company's Top 10 best-seller list. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had been seeing a lot of ethnic-inspired clothes, and that's why we 
decided to go with it," Villanueva said. "The patterns have been very 
successful because there was a need, and it was definitely unfulfilled." 
</P>
<P>
 Ethnic marketing is just another kind of marketing segmentation, said Amy 
Hilliard-Jones, senior vice president and director of integrated marketing for 
Burrell Communications Group of Chicago. The company does market advertising, 
public relations, promotions and broadcast programming for the black market. 
</P>
<P>
 The E Style catalogue is a good concept, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilliard-Jones said there is more ethnic marketing now than in the past 
because the business opportunities can be substantiated by census demographics. 
The 1990 census was the first to report that one in every four Americans is 
black, Asian, Latino or American Indian and that the minority population is 
growing faster than the white population. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're a business person or a marketer, you cannot ignore that," 
Hilliard-Jones said. "It's not social responsibility; it's the age-old business 
practice: Give folks what they need -- supply and demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it has taken a long time, longer than it should have," she added. 
"Sometimes it takes major numbers that can no longer be ignored to get people 
moving."

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LYNWOOD; CITY OFFICIALS POSTPONE INCREASE IN WATER RATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN J. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has indefinitely postponed a controversial 75% increase in 
water rates after citizens bombarded city officials with complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said they will hold a series of public meetings to explain why 
a rate increase is needed.No dates have been set. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dozens of calls have come in questioning (the increase) and that's what we 
want to answer," said Councilman Louis Heine. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Armando Rea said callers also were protesting a council decision to 
divert millions of dollars of water revenues for other purposes in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The council called a special meeting Monday morning to discuss postponement of 
the rate increase. Mayor Paul H. Richards II and council members Heine and 
Louis Byrd voted for the delay. Rea and Henning did not attend, saying they 
were given inadequate notice. They had opposed the initial decision to raise 
water rates. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the rates had remained unchanged for seven years and that 
the price of water purchased from the Metropolitan Water District had doubled 
over recent years. But officials acknowledged that the city also had 
transferred more than $4 million from the water fund into the general fund over 
the last seven years to help balance the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Faustin Gonzales said other cities have similar policies. JOHN J.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: LONG BEACH; MARINE PATROL GIVEN POWER TO ARREST BOATERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has granted Long Beach's marine patrol officers authority to 
arrest boaters for criminal activities.They will not be permitted to carry 
firearms, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently the 11 patrol officers can cite boaters for infractions such as 
speeding or improper loading. But if they encounter a more serious crime such 
as boating under the influence of alcohol, the officers can only detain the 
suspect until police arrive, said Jim Rae, who heads the Long Beach Fire 
Department's Marine Safety division.

 The officers patrol the city's waterways, marinas and channel entrances. JOHN

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has placed a high-ranking employee in the city's public 
housing agency on administrative leave and ordered an investigation into 
possible conflict-of-interest charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The employee, who oversees the city's federally funded housing program for 
low-income families, apparently was paid to manage an apartment building for 
several months by a landlord who was participating in the program and was 
temporarily out of state, a city official said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a closed meeting Tuesday, the council ordered City Administrator Nelson 
Oliva to investigate whether the employee violated city codes prohibiting 
conflicts of interest, the official said. The employee, whose name was not 
released, was placed on leave last week. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials would not release any other information concerning the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The employee coordinated the U.S. Housing and Urban Development's Section 8 
program, which provides federal rent subsidies for low-income families to 
obtain housing. HUD contracts with the city's public housing agency, which 
oversees the program.

QUEEN MARY'S OPERATORS JUMP AT CHANCE TO ADD BUNGEE TOWER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During the Queen Mary's heyday, guests would retire to the upper deck for a 
polite game of shuffleboard. This fall, visitors to the Long Beach attraction 
may have the chance to try something more extreme: bungee jumping. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Harbor Commissioners and the city Planning Commission have given 
the operator of a bungee jumping business approval to construct a 210-foot 
jumping tower next to the luxury liner's bow. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Voorhees, who ran a bungee site in San Diego County, said he has 
applied for permits and hopes to open in mid-September. The Queen Mary will 
receive about 10% of the operator's sales, said Joseph F. Prevratil, president 
of the nonprofit group that runs the ship. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Barnes, president of the Long Beach Historical Society, said bungee 
jumping "doesn't fit the image of the beautiful, historic ship." 
</P>
<P>
 Prevratil said the structure would not detract from the ship's beauty. "There 
are activities surrounding the Eiffel Tower in Paris that are not of the same 
quality as the Eiffel Tower, but they do not take away from its grace and 
majesty," he said.

WOMAN PLEADS GUILTY TO CREDIT CARD FRAUD; COURTS: EMPLOYEE USED MORTGAGE 
COMPANY DATA TO BUY MERCHANDISE, GET CASH ADVANCES AND APPLY FOR LOANS. 
</P>

<P>
 A Downey woman who was accused of using stolen credit card numbers to buy 
thousands of dollars worth of goods in other people's names pleaded guilty this 
week to 12 felony charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Debra LaGrone, 40, faces a five-year prison term when she is sentenced Sept. 
13 in Norwalk Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 LaGrone's attorney, Charles E. Mullis, said she decided to plead guilty 
because of the abundant evidence in the case, including surveillance 
photographs showing LaGrone making withdrawals on a victim's credit account at 
an automated teller machine in Downey. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court documents, LaGrone obtained credit card numbers and other 
confidential information while working at mortgage companies in Los Angeles and 
Orange counties, then bought thousands of dollars worth of goods on those 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 In some instances, LaGrone called credit card companies, reported cards 
missing and requested replacements, court records show. LaGrone also applied 
for loans and obtained cash advances in other people's names and ordered 
merchandise through department stores, jewelry boutiques and clothing 
catalogues. 
</P>
<P>
 When Downey fraud investigators searched LaGrone's townhouse in January, they 
found credit cards with other people's names and account numbers, jewelry that 
had been fraudulently purchased and a spiral notebook filled with names, home 
addresses and credit information of people who had recently refinanced their 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, authorities documented more than $50,000 worth of purchases and 
identified at least 15 individuals across Southern California as victims, in 
addition to many small merchants, department stores, credit card companies and 
banks that suffered losses. 
</P>
<P>
 LaGrone pleaded guilty to charges of commercial burglary, making a false 
financial statement, fraudulent use of an access card, receiving stolen 
property and possession of methamphetamines. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plea agreement, LaGrone could spend all or part of her sentence at a 
state drug rehabilitation center in Riverside County that houses first-time 
felony offenders who have substance abuse problems. A hearing will be held 
after LaGrone's sentencing to determine whether she is eligible, Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Steve Katz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of LaGrone's victims said they were dissatisfied with her sentence. They 
are still trying to correct credit problems caused by LaGrone's acts and want 
to see her spend more time behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad they got her for something, but it seems like a light sentence for 
what she did to me," said Dorothy LaGrone, 74, who is not related to Debra 
LaGrone. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Debra LaGrone virtually assumed Dorothy LaGrone's identity by 
using Dorothy LaGrone's credit card numbers and changing her address with the 
Postal Service and with a national credit reporting agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would hate for someone else to go through what I went through for a whole 
year," Dorothy LaGrone said.

A WEEKEND TRIP TO MERRY OLDE ENGLAND; ENTERTAINMENT: THE RENAISSANCE ARTS 
FESTIVAL WILL RE-CREATE THE TRAPPINGS OF THE 16TH CENTURY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Allen Hughes works as a sheet-metal mechanic at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard, 
but this weekend he will don the trappings of 16th-Century England and help 
transform downtown's Shoreline Park into an Olde English village. 
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach Renaissance Arts Festival is coming to town, and for two days 
Hughes and other volunteers will have the chance to become any character they 
choose -- peasant, nobleman, Gypsy, craftsman, minstrel and others. Many 
volunteers say they participate in the festival year after year because they 
love re-creating the history of the era. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely different than the normal grind," Hughes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival, celebrating its 10th anniversary this year, seeks to re-create a 
spring celebration during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, complete with royal 
feasts, mock battles, parades, folk pageants, traditional games and 
fortunetellers. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighty booths, surrounding the Rainbow Lagoon at Shoreline Park, will have 
enough food and drinks to satisfy the hungriest knight and lady. And dozens of 
vendors will sell items ranging from swords and daggers to jewelry and handmade 
garlands. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival is a fund-raiser for the Traveler's Aid Society, a United Way 
agency that assists the homeless. It relies on about 600 volunteer performers 
to add an authentic flavor and interact with customers. Although some pageants 
are scripted, most of the actors' work at the Long Beach festival is 
improvisational. 
</P>
<P>
 The royal court also is composed of volunteer actors. This year's royalty will 
include King James, who ruled Scotland during Elizabeth's reign and assumed her 
throne when she died without an heir in 1603; his Queen, Ann of Denmark; the 
Irish Queen and her entourage, and the King of Denmark. King James will be 
played by Ole Olausson, a Whittier resident who has portrayed royal figures at 
festivals for 17 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Performers pride themselves on making sure costumes are authentic and that 
accessories, from drinking cups to metalwork, could be created from the 
technology and tools of the Elizabethan era. They often chide festival-goers 
for wearing "strange bejeweled blindfolds" (sunglasses, of course) and athletic 
shoes that show the person is no doubt dealing with "a shady pirate who doth 
sail from the Far East." 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes, a history buff who collects 16th-Century firearm replicas, will 
demonstrate his skill with a primitive musket. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Owen, a respiratory therapist at the Long Beach Veteran's Hospital, will 
be playing tunes on a "sak-but," one of the first valved brass instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 Owen, 29, attended his first festival in 1986 and has returned as an actor 
since 1988. "It was exciting to see people dressed up in costume and speaking 
in the (Olde English) language I'd never heard before, using 'thees' and 
'thous.' It really was a whole new world," Owen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other performers, Owen spends many summer weekends at festivals across 
the state, including San Marcos, San Bernardino, Long Beach and San Luis 
Obispo. Some festival organizers pay performers, but the sums usually don't 
exceed lunch money. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Renaissance festivals, as they exist today, began in 1963 with the Renaissance 
Pleasure Faire, which is held in San Bernardino. 
</P>
<P>
 In a similar spirit, other nonprofit and fund-raising festivals have been 
organized during the years. Long Beach's festival, which attracted about 12,000 
people last year, raises an average of $23,000 for the homeless each year. 
</P>
<P>
 The performers speak highly of the community and friendships that develop 
among people who may have little in common except the bond of a bygone time. 
</P>
<P>
 "You develop friendships over a series of weekends, and then you go back to 
your home life for the rest of the year," said Kathy Hughes (her husband is the 
musketeer). "But many longtime friendships are made at the festivals. There's 
an open-mindedness and acceptance that you don't find elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Transforming oneself into a different character and persona, with names, 
background and attitudes developed by the performer, is a unique creative 
outlet, said Natalie Beatie of Gardena, who plays a brewer's wife in a group of 
traveling merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Creating a character allows you the freedom to do things that you wouldn't 
ordinarily do," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 The Long Beach Renaissance Arts Festival will be Saturday and Sunday from 10 
a.m. to 6 p.m. at the Rainbow Lagoon, near Pine Avenue and Shoreline Drive. 
Admission is $8 for adults, $5 for seniors, $2 for children ages 5 through 12. 
Children under 5 are free. Information: (310) 437-0751.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CERRITOS; COURT UPHOLDS FIRING OF 26-YEAR TEACHER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A state appeals court has upheld a decision by the ABC School District to fire 
a music teacher accused of improperly touching his students. 
</P>
<P>
 The district suspended junior high teacher Kenneth Haar, a 26-year employee, 
in 1992 after students accused him of immoral conduct.One girl testified that 
Haar stroked her thigh with his fingers. Other students said Haar dressed up as 
Santa Claus and told his female students he would give them extra raffle 
tickets in exchange for sitting on his lap and hugging and kissing him. 
</P>
<P>
 A school district panel decided in June, 1992, that Haar did not engage in 
immoral conduct and ordered Haar's reinstatement. But the school board took the 
matter to court, and a Superior Court judge ruled that the district had grounds 
for dismissing him. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC attorney James Baca said the appellate court ruling confirms the 
district's duty to protect students from harassment by teachers. "It's an 
indication that . . . children who are being sexually harassed by their teacher 
have some recourse," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Haar's attorney, Lawrence Rosenzweig, said Haar has not decided whether to 
appeal to the state Supreme Court. PSYCHE PASCUAL

<P>
 Cerritos Towne Center's new 40-store retail complex is throwing a three-day 
grand opening this weekend featuring music and free food samples. 
</P>
<P>
 The shopping center, anchored by a Wal-Mart store and Smith's Food & Drug 
Center, will provide about 900 jobs when all 40 businesses are open in October, 
and should provide the city with about $3.5 million in revenue in its first 
year, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is expected to collect $1.8 million in lease payments and $1.7 
million in sales taxes from the center's developers in the coming year, said 
city spokeswoman Michele Wastal. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix-based Vestar Development built the center on 40 acres of city land at 
Bloomfield Avenue and Towne Center Drive. The retail stores are part of a 
125-acre complex that includes a business park, hotel and the Cerritos 
Performing Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The grand opening events are scheduled from 10 a.m. to 9:30 p.m. Friday 
through Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 25 stores, including Wal-Mart and Smith's, have already opened.

 A local retired aerospace engineer has been chosen for the second time to lead 
a national 100,000-member organization of Latino veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 Jake I. Alarid, 60, was elected national commander of the American GI Forum of 
the United States at the organization's recent convention in Santa Clara.A 
forum member for 24 years, Alarid previously served as national commander in 
1983-84. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarid was an engineering manager at Rockwell International Corp. before 
retiring earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined the forum in 1970 during the Vietnam War after noticing that Latino 
veterans were having problems receiving benefits. "Some were sick or wounded 
and were not receiving any benefits at all," said Alarid, who served in the 
Korean War. Alarid became a local chapter chairman in 1972 and served as state 
chairman in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization, founded in 1948 in Corpus Christi, Tex., counsels veterans 
and lobbies on issues such as immigrants' rights and universal health care.

COMMUNITY NEWS: HAWAIIAN GARDENS; NOT GUILTY PLEA ENTERED IN ATTEMPTED MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A convicted murderer accused of attacking a Hawaiian Gardens woman last August 
and leaving her for dead has pleaded not guilty to charges of attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
 James Lum Shamburger, 47, was ordered by Los Cerritos Municipal Commissioner 
Leo Villa to return to court Sept. 7 for a preliminary hearing to determine if 
there is enough evidence to hold him for trial.He remains in custody in lieu of 
$500,000 bail.  
</P>
<P>
 The victim, who is in her 20s, spent four days in a garage until she was found 
barely alive. She was in a coma for months before she recovered and assisted 
authorities in arresting the suspect, Deputy Dist. Atty. Clifton Garrott said. 
Shamburger allegedly picked the woman up in the Hawaiian Gardens area last Aug. 
27 and took her to a vacant garage. During a struggle, he allegedly hit her on 
the head with a hatchet or similar sharp-edged instrument.  
</P>
<P>
 Four days later, a man who was looking for his girlfriend's dog peered into 
the partially open garage and smelled what he believed to be the odor of a 
decomposing body. Sheriff's deputies at first believed the woman was dead, but 
when homicide detectives arrived, they discovered she was still breathing. The 
woman, whose name was withheld, was hospitalized until February. 
</P>
<P>
 Shamburger spent 11 years in state prison for the Aug. 3, 1977, murder in Los 
Angeles of his wife, who was beaten on the head with a baseball bat.

COMMUNITY NEWS: LONG BEACH; PANEL IS STUDYING PLAN FOR BATTING CAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By JOHN POPE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's Planning Commission is studying a proposal that would allow batting 
cages and other recreational activities in industrially zoned areas of North 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Jerry Shultz, who introduced the proposal at last week's council 
meeting, said that several vacant, weed-covered lots in the area could possibly 
be used for such activities, but are restricted by zoning codes that call for 
industrial use only. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my district we have virtually nothing as far as youth entertainment," 
Shultz said. "And most of the kids, especially in single-parent families, can't 
leave town to go to batting cages elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Shultz said he is interested in batting cages because they can be built on 
relatively small areas and could generate revenue for other city youth 
programs. Batting cages could also be an asset to the North Long Beach Pony 
Baseball League and the Jordan High School baseball team, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the bottom line is, we have to get more kids off the street and offer 
them something other than hanging out," Shultz said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council referred the proposal to the planning commission. JOHN POPE

COMMUNITY NEWS: CERRITOS; TENTATIVE OK GIVEN TO 61-HOME DEVELOPMENT

<P>
 The City Council has given an Orange County developer tentative permission to 
build 61 homes on 13 acres of vacant land next to Whitney High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members approved a development map by Costa Mesa-based Warmington 
Homes, but final project plans must still clear the Planning Commission before 
construction begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Warmington officials said they will deliver the detailed plans to city staff 
by December and hope to start building in January. The homes should go up for 
sale in the summer of 1995, said Jay Deckard, a Warmington senior project 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC Unified School District entered a partnership with Warmington last year to 
develop the property to raise money for much-needed repairs, classroom 
construction and a new gymnasium at the school. The developer purchased the 
property for $7.7 million and will give ABC a small percentage of each home 
sale. The homes will range in price from $350,000 to $375,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Council member Grace Hu cast the lone vote against the proposal. She said the 
tract will create congestion in the neighborhood. "The city is developing very, 
very rapidly, and we are not leaving any space behind for the people after us 
to develop," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby residents and parents of students at the school have voiced opposition 
to the plan, saying they believe that ABC is not receiving a fair price for the 
land and that the development will cause parking difficulties for students.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH GATE; POLICE CENTER AT TARGET STORE OFFERS SAFETY TIPS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Carjacking prevention hint No. 8: If a suspicious person approaches your car, 
police say, drive away quickly and carefully -- even if you must go through a 
red light. 
</P>
<P>
 In a move exemplifying cooperation between the private and public sectors, 
police last week opened a police information center in the busy parking lot of 
the Target store at 5700 Firestone Ave. to make crime prevention tips more 
readily available to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, located in a trailer under the Target sign, will be open three or 
four days a week, depending on staff availability, said Police Chief Ron 
George. In addition to providing residents with information on preventing 
crimes such as carjacking and kidnaping, the center will serve as a meeting 
point for area police, who can use the facility to prepare reports and 
communicate with headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff will also provide bicycle safety classes. Officers will not be able 
to detain crime suspects at the center. 
</P>
<P>
 At grand opening festivities replete with beauty queens, area politicians and 
a police robot called Sparky -- George lauded the new center: "This is a 
win-win situation. The city wins, since its awareness of crime prevention 
increases, and Target wins, since it gains a police presence on its property," 
he said to 40 people on hand for the ribbon-cutting ceremony.  
</P>
<P>
 In the second experiment of this kind, Target is paying all of the police 
center's expenses. Last year, Long Beach police established a center at 
Target's store at 950 E. 33rd St. in that city. SIMON ROMERO

SIGNING OFF; STIFFER PENALTIES, ENHANCED POLICE ACTIVITY AND REWARDS HAVE CUT 
NEIGHBORHOOD GRAFFITI. THE FAD IS FADING, OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the past decade, residents of southeast Los Angeles County have viewed the 
writing on their walls with increasing alarm. As graffiti crept in, entire 
neighborhoods were marked with the stamp of urban blight and it seemed no area 
was safe from the spiky calligraphy of taggers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tolerance ran out. Taggers were denounced, and laws were passed to keep spray 
paint out of teen-age hands and to force parents to pay for their children's 
vandalism. Police officers were assigned to tagger investigation units, 
residents organized volunteer cleaning crews and cities invested thousands of 
dollars in cover-up paint. Some cities also offered rewards for information 
leading to the conviction of taggers. And convicted taggers began to pay a 
stiff price in court for their work.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, the news from the graffiti front may be better than expected. Aggressive 
anti-tagging efforts seem to be paying off. 
</P>
<P>
 In Long Beach, police officers estimate that tagging incidents are down by 
90%. Graffiti paint-out crews are spending more time blending paint to fit the 
original wall color, less time slapping paint over fresh "tags." In Norwalk, a 
special surveillance trailer, previously used to catch taggers in the act, has 
been sitting idle for six months, city officials said, because there are no 
problem areas to stake out. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also say there hasn't been a big jump in graffiti incidents this 
summer, when school vacations and idle hands in the past combined to create 
havoc with fresh paint. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a fad, like break-dancing a few years ago, and it's definitely on 
its way out," said Alvin Bernstein, a Long Beach probation officer. "We can see 
the signs everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 In two middle schools, where Bernstein has offices during the school year as 
part of a gang-prevention program, fewer notebooks bear graffiti-style doodles, 
he said. There are fewer young taggers, Bernstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, police and city workers say, they are seeing cleaner walls and fewer 
organized tagging crews than they did about three years ago, when most believe 
the fad peaked. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this doesn't mean the taggers have gone away. In one notorious 
incident recently, two competing crews covered seven miles of the Long Beach 
Freeway in both directions with paint, resulting in about $100,000 damage. So 
far, six adults and 10 juveniles have been arrested in connection with the 
spree. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidents like this keep the costs of fighting graffiti high, authorities say. 
The city of Long Beach, struggling through a lingering recession, spends about 
$1 million every year on a graffiti-abatement program that involves several 
departments, including police. That price tag has remained consistent for the 
past three years, said John Hough, special projects officer with the Public 
Service Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Even tiny La Habra Heights, which doesn't have a single store or teen hangout 
within its city limits, spends $1,000 every year to paint over graffiti, mainly 
on street signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners and business people say there's another cost -- a decline in 
property values in areas coated with graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Many cities have assigned employees solely to clean up after teen tagging 
rivalries, and those salaries are generally dwarfed by the cost of paint and 
materials to cover up the tags. Even after a paint-out, buildings, alleys and 
schools can look as though they've suffered a bad case of blemishes. Paint 
colors don't always match, multiple layers of paint begin to peel and a sense 
of urban blight sets in.  
</P>
<P>
 To combat this pox upon their houses, cities passed laws and funded programs 
to discourage taggers. Some offer hefty rewards for information that leads to 
the conviction of taggers. Many cities dictate that stores lock up spray paint, 
wide-tipped markers and glass-etching tools to keep them out of customers' 
reach. The state also provided another weapon, a law prohibiting minors from 
possessing aerosol paint cans. 
</P>
<P>
 In Norwalk, the impact of the city's anti-graffiti effort is most evident 
along the narrow one-way streets and old houses in the southwest part of town. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be that no sooner would you take graffiti off in the one-ways than 
it would be right back up," said Kevin Gano, public safety director. "Now we 
don't even see one-third the graffiti we used to." 
</P>
<P>
 Gano says several programs, initiated by his city within the past four years, 
are responsible for the cleaner walls. The city offers free paint to residents 
to cover up graffiti, and responds within 24 hours to businesses requesting 
graffiti removal.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Norwalk officials also set up a surveillance team to stake out areas hard hit 
by graffiti. This Tagging Enforcement Suppression Team, known as TEST, 
consisted of sheriff's deputies, probation officers, city workers and community 
volunteers who shared stakeout duties in a mobile trailer and waited for 
taggers to show up. In the past year, the trailer was deployed six times. The 
surveillance resulted in the arrest of about 20 taggers who were photographed 
or observed in the act, Gano said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The program has been so successful, we haven't had to take the trailer out in 
about six months," he said. "Graffiti is just way down." 
</P>
<P>
 Gano says calls for graffiti removal have dropped from 5,989 in 1992 to 3,462 
last year, to just 1,004 through July of this year. City spending on graffiti 
cleanup dropped from $268,000 in 1992 to $156,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Gano said a city curfew for juveniles has also contributed significantly to 
the drop in graffiti. Seven days a week, between the hours of 10 p.m. and 5 
a.m., sheriff's deputies can pick up anyone under the age of 18 just for being 
outside without a guardian. Juvenile curfew violators are taken to a trailer, 
and parents are called to collect their children. While not all of the 
late-night teens are taggers, just getting kids off the streets at night has 
helped reduce graffiti, Gano said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If there is a second curfew violation, parents are charged $163 to help defray 
costs of deploying the trailers, and must appear before a Juvenile Court 
commissioner, where they could be fined an additional $100 and be sentenced to 
60 hours of community service, generally cleaning graffiti. The commissioner 
can also require Mom and Dad to attend parenting classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach also has a curfew, but no ordinance to penalize parents of repeat 
violators. Council members are considering such a law. 
</P>
<P>
 Some school districts are also taking advantage of a 2-year-old state law 
giving school officials the authority to make parents financially responsible 
for the crimes of their children on school property. 
</P>
<P>
 The Downey Unified School District bills parents of children caught 
vandalizing school property. The Norwalk-La Mirada Unified School District is 
considering a similar plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Although painting out walls and fining parents help reduce graffiti, police 
officers say a brush with the law and the threat of harsh penalties can really 
persuade taggers to give up their aerosol cans.  
</P>
<P>
 Two staunch advocates of aggressive penalties for taggers are Long Beach 
police officers Bob and Barry Fowks. For two years, the brothers have spent 
much of their time on tagging investigations. They pride themselves on knowing 
most of the paint-flecked players in town. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaning against a pale blue sedan they consider their office, Barry Fowks 
pulls two pictures from a thick stack of Polaroids showing Long Beach taggers 
and their handiwork. The Fowkses have been watching two brothers, waiting 
patiently for the right time to make an arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "See, if we just let them go a little, we'll have enough evidence to convict 
them of felony vandalism. We've given them some rope and they're getting close 
to hanging themselves," said Barry Fowks, 41. 
</P>
<P>
 Once graffiti damage tops $5,000 a juvenile or adult can be charged with a 
felony. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a tagger is convicted, the punishment can make tagging seem very 
unattractive. 
</P>
<P>
 Juvenile Court Commissioner Robert Axel knows how to get a teen-ager's 
attention, Fowks said. Although there are variations, Axel generally imposes 
the following restrictions on convicted taggers: 
</P>
<P>
 * Attend every class every school day, no exceptions without a signed doctor's 
note. 
</P>
<P>
 * Maintain a C average. 
</P>
<P>
 * Be home by 8 p.m., seven days a week, for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Give up driver's license until age 21. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pay restitution for graffiti damages. 
</P>
<P>
 * Perform 100 hours of community service, painting out graffiti under 
supervision of parents. 
</P>
<P>
 If the youths get caught staying out late or driving a car -- necessary 
privileges to carry out all-important teen dating rituals -- they could be sent 
away to juvenile camp for six months. Teen-agers convicted of a felony could be 
locked up for three years for violating probation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've tried a number of things over the years, from locking them up to begging 
and pleading," Axel said. "This seems to work." 
</P>
<P>
 In Norwalk courtrooms, a typical punishment might be loss of a driver's 
license for one year, restitution for damages, fines and community service 
ranging from 60 hours to 20 days, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fowks brothers and probation officer Bernstein agree that Axel's sentences 
seem to work. Youths who have heard of the punishment have approached the 
Fowkses and Bernstein, swearing they've left their tagging days behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "The probation (conditions) he hands out really would have hurt when I was 
that age," Bob Fowks said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Fowkses estimate that tagging incidents have dropped by 90% in the past 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We drive the 50 square miles of Long Beach every day we work. We know when 
new tags go up and where," said Bob Fowks, 51. "And we've seen a huge drop in 
activity." 
</P>
<P>
 They give a tour of a Central Long Beach neighborhood whose buildings bear 
familiar patchwork paint jobs, but very few new tags.  
</P>
<P>
 Some taggers say pressure from an unlikely source -- gangs -- has also 
contributed to the decline of graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back in '91, it was really fun," said Paul Afa, 17. "Everybody thought it was 
cool. But in '93, the (Mexican) Mafia came in and told the gangs to make the 
taggers calm down. Then it got dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Afa's crew broke up, he said, after several were arrested and others were 
intimidated by gang members who flashed guns and made threats.  
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein, the Fowks brothers and others said they also had heard that 
organized gangs were threatening taggers. The gang members didn't like the 
taggers bringing law enforcement heat into the neighborhoods, interfering with 
more serious criminal activity. 
</P>
<P>
 As if the gang members, police, teachers, probation officers and tough judges 
weren't enough, taggers also faced another foe -- self-appointed graffiti 
busters. Known derisively as "heroes," these people cruise the area searching 
for taggers, taking pictures and noting license-plate numbers, and turning them 
in to authorities to collect rewards. 
</P>
<P>
 One such hero, a former Long Beach resident who asked not to be identified for 
fear of reprisal, has made about $20,000 in recent years by collecting reward 
money, mostly from Long Beach, which offers $1,000 per conviction. He is 
well-known to police for his frequent tips. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's a downside to this kind of work. After living 30 years in Long 
Beach, he moved his family to Compton two years ago, where fewer people knew 
his sideline. He also dons a bulletproof vest before cruising for taggers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now they have tag-bangers, these kids who are in the initiation process and 
about to join a gang, and they're more violent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Afa was headed down this path, but was caught, convicted and received one of 
Axel's stiff sentences. Afa says he has sworn off tagging entirely.  
</P>
<P>
 Around his Central Long Beach neighborhood, he says he still sees a few 
younger wanna-be taggers, and they just make him shake his head and laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day, those younger kids will find out the hard way, just like I did," Afa 
said. "And when they do, they'll stop tagging, too."

HE'S TACKLING A NEW ENDEAVOR; SEMIPRO FOOTBALL: AFTER LOSING HIS JOB, CLINT 
DURAN DISCOVERED HE HAD NOT LOST HIS LOVE FOR THE GRIDIRON, SO HE STARTED HIS 
OWN TEAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After graduating from Montebello High in 1987, it didn't take long for Clint 
Duran to discover that there was not a great demand for 5-foot-5, 120-pound 
receivers in college football. 
</P>
<P>
 That did little to quell Duran's affection for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 So Duran did the next best thing -- he created his own semiprofessional team. 
Next month, he will return to the gridiron for the first time since high school 
as a player and owner of the Montebello Panthers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some guys might want to use semipro football as a steppingstone to the pros, 
but there are guys who love the game of football and don't care whether it's 
pro or street ball," Duran, 24, said. "Just like in any sport, there are 
die-hard athletes who live and die for football. I created the team for those 
guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Duran has paid the price. About $20,000, to be exact, to cover the cost of 
uniforms, equipment, insurance and rental of the field at Cantwell-Sacred Heart 
of Mary High for home games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers will play in the California Football League, which includes the 
Southern California Storm, San Diego Storm, the Orange County Cowboys, San 
Bernardino Blitz, Antelope Valley Crusaders and Ventura County Warriors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers, who open the season Sept. 10, will play a 12-game regular season 
schedule under NFL rules, culminating with the playoffs and an all-star game. 
The team is coached by Jess Hunter, an architect from Pico Rivera. 
</P>
<P>
 Players do not receive a salary and must pay a $100 registration fee. They 
must supply their own pads and helmets. Ages range from 18 to 34 with varying 
amounts of experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Tight end Paul Albertini and fullback Nate Bolton played at Long Beach State 
and Fresno State, respectively. Quarterback Joey Jordan helped Schurr High to a 
Southern Section title in 1980 and was an All-Southern California 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference selection for four years at Whittier 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan, 31, a teacher at Eastmont Intermediate School in Montebello, played in 
Europe the past several years. He intended to visit a couple of practices but 
has wound up as offensive coordinator. One of Jordan's former fifth-grade 
students, Dennis Felix, 18, is a receiver on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't have any plays and they were using simple formations and routes," 
Jordan said. "There was no way they were going to beat anybody with that. I 
started calling my own plays and got locked onto it. I finally decided to stick 
it out with them." 
</P>
<P>
 For Duran, the franchise has become a full-time endeavor. Duran was released 
from his job as a quality-control technician for a food manufacturing company 
in February and spends most of his day searching for sponsors from local 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got laid off at the perfect time," Duran said. "I was working nights and it 
would have interfered with soliciting sponsorship for the team. Plus, this is a 
lot more fun than looking at crackers all day." 
</P>
<P>
 Duran, who will play tailback and has gained 35 pounds since high school, 
first became interested in semipro football after answering a newspaper ad for 
the San Bernardino Blitz last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 He practiced with the Blitz for several weeks, but said he left the team 
because of favoritism by the owner, who was also the coach and quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was there to have fun, but I was pretty disappointed with all the conflicts 
with the owner," Duran said. "I wasn't comfortable with the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 The experience, however, put the wheels in motion for Duran to start his own 
team. The Panthers were unanimously accepted into the league at a board meeting 
in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding players was another thing. Only five showed up on the first day of 
practice and even Duran's brother, Frank, was reluctant to join at first. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no organization and it was just a bunch of weekend warriors," Frank 
Duran, 27, said. "A lot of guys would show up one day and wouldn't show up the 
next. I didn't really feel it was worth it to get beat up and not get paid, but 
I started building friendships and going regularly." 
</P>
<P>
 So did others. The team has nearly 40 players and is still growing. Most of 
the players hold full-time jobs and have families, which are factors in 
limiting the team to only two practices a week at Chet Holifield Park in 
Montebello. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a matter of friends telling friends," Duran said. "Getting to the 
first game has been a headache, getting the equipment and getting the guys all 
out at the same time. It's been adventure and hasn't been easy. We're going 
into this blindfolded but hopefully we'll do well and get some fan support."
