DELAY IN NOTIFYING CORONER HURT SIMPSON CASE PROBE; INVESTIGATION: EFFORTS TO 
PINPOINT TIME OF DEATHS WERE HAMPERED, TOUGH LAPD POLICY WAS VIOLATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Los Angeles police detectives disregarded state law and their own departmental 
policy when they waited hours to summon the county coroner to examine the 
bodies of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman, documents and 
interviews show. 
</P>
<P>
 The delay -- one in a string of late notifications that has frustrated the 
coroner's office in recent years -- hampered efforts to pinpoint a precise time 
of death and now looms as a scientific problem in the case against O.J. 
Simpson, forensic experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Documents show police were warned two years ago that state law required them 
to notify the coroner immediately in cases of murder and certain other deaths, 
and Police Chief Willie L. Williams responded by issuing a tough new policy to 
that effect. 
</P>
<P>
 But records show that detectives did not follow those guidelines in the hectic 
hours after the bodies were discovered at the Bundy Drive murder scene June 13. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development, Simpson lawyer Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. said Friday 
night that "the majority view on the defense team is that Simpson should 
testify" and added that his client "wants to testify" at his trial. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he said, "A final decision has not been made because we have not had 
to make that decision."  
</P>
<P>
 Cochran said he expected "a healthy discussion" on the issue among the defense 
lawyers. He predicted that differing views would be voiced and that the group 
would try to forge a consensus and if necessary take a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times was unable to reach Simpson's other lead lawyer, Robert L. Shapiro, 
on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, police spokesman Lt. John Dunkin said he would not discuss 
why detectives waited to notify the coroner's office about the bodies. "Those 
are issues that are going to be examined in detail during the course of the 
upcoming court trial and it's not appropriate for us to discuss them outside 
that setting," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But a police source close to the investigation added: "(The delay) is not 
unusual, that's all I can say." 
</P>
<P>
 California law makes it a misdemeanor for a physician, funeral director "or 
other person" not to immediately notify the coroner about violent and 
suspicious deaths, including suicides and murders. The coroner's office has 
legal responsibility for determining the manner and time of death. 
</P>
<P>
 In the overwhelming majority of murder cases, however, homicide detectives say 
it is either impractical or unnecessary to call a coroner's investigator to the 
scene immediately. It is often obvious how and when a person was killed, they 
say, and their first duty is to preserve the crime scene for the collection of 
evidence. Having another official present might disturb such things as 
fingerprints and bloodstains, detectives said, and the fact that the coroner 
arrives later is of little consequence. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the grisly slayings of Nicole Simpson and Goldman -- where the time of 
death is a crucial element -- experts now warn that the 10-hour delay before a 
coroner's investigator was allowed to test the bodies is a major investigatory 
gaffe. 
</P>
<P>
 The delay, forensic pathologists say, effectively prevented the coroner from 
estimating a time for the attack reliable enough for the prosecution to 
contradict Simpson's alibi that he was at his Brentwood home at the time of the 
attack, waiting for a ride to the airport at 11 p.m. Tests performed at the 
death scene include taking the temperature of the victim's liver, observing the 
onset of rigor mortis and testing for how quickly blood has settled into the 
body's extremities. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Los Angeles Deputy Medical Examiner Irwin L. Golden testified at 
Simpson's preliminary hearing in July that the murders were committed 
"somewhere between 9 (p.m.) and midnight," and he admitted under 
cross-examination that the standard measurements upon which he based his 
decision would have been more accurate if taken sooner. 
</P>
<P>
 "The farther away you go from the time of death, the more inaccurate you 
become," said Werner U. Spitz, former Wayne County, Mich., medical examiner and 
author of a widely used forensic pathology textbook. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big problem is that the coroner's office should have been informed 
immediately because the coroner at the scene would have the ability to take the 
temperature and make other observations . . . to have a much better foundation 
for the time of death," Spitz said. 
</P>
<P>
 A more precise time of death also could have been to Simpson's advantage if it 
indicated the murders took place after 11 p.m., when a limousine driver 
testified that the football great got into his car for a ride to the airport. 
Still, the three-hour period specified by Golden also gives defense attorneys 
room to raise reasonable doubt in the minds of jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson has pleaded not guilty. Jury selection in the case is expected to 
begin Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Dean Gilmour, captain of the Los Angeles County coroner's investigations 
division, said Friday that in most cases, police and other emergency services 
have been prompt in giving notification about deaths -- but exceptions are 
noteworthy and disturbing to coroner's investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Police Department and coroner's office held a high-level meeting 
July 26 to try to resolve the long-running notification problem underscored by 
the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmour said that several years ago he received a call on the midnight shift 
about a man who had died of a heart attack on a city bus at 3rd and Ord streets 
that afternoon. "Here, a gentleman had been on the back of the bus for eight 
hours before we were notified," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, coroner's officials wrote two letters to LAPD Chief Williams 
reminding him of state law and urging him to make sure the department gave 
prompt notification. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig R. Harvey, chief of the coroner's operations bureau, wrote July 24, 
1992, to complain that police waited seven hours before calling about an 
off-duty California Highway Patrol officer who was gunned down by an angry 
motorist near the Los Angeles Convention Center the night before. 
</P>
<P>
 And in September, 1992, former coroner's department Director Ilona Lewis wrote 
to Williams about how police handled a Metro Rail Blue Line accident in which a 
driver and his passenger were killed at a crossing gate in South Los Angeles. 
Lewis said that police never called, although two LAPD traffic divisions were 
notified, and that the coroner's office decided to send out investigators after 
hearing radio reports about the traffic backup. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams changed department policy when he issued a special order Nov. 17, 
1993, requiring that "the investigating officer at the scene of a death . . . 
shall make notification immediately upon determining that the death falls 
within the purview of the coroner's office. If the coroner is not immediately 
needed at the scene, the investigating officer shall advise the coroner of an 
approximate time when the coroner's deputy can respond. 
</P>
<P>
 "When circumstances indicate that the investigation of the death requires the 
expertise of a specialized investigator (e.g., homicide detective, traffic 
collision investigator), immediate notification to the coroner shall be made by 
the concerned specialized investigator who responds to the scene of the 
incident," the order says. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Williams' order, grand jury testimony, court transcripts and coroner's 
records show that police waited hours before calling the coroner in the Simpson 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Nicole Simpson's dog, a neighbor discovered the bodies about 12:10 
a.m., and Gilmour said the coroner's log showed that both Nicole Simpson and 
Goldman were pronounced dead by other authorities at 12:45 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD Homicide Detective Mark Fuhrman testified in the preliminary hearing that 
his supervisor called him at home about 1:05 a.m. and that he first arrived at 
Nicole Simpson's condominium at 2:10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it became apparent who was involved in this, a determination was made 
that this was one that would be handled by the Robbery Homicide Division, the 
elite corps" of homicide detectives, Lt. Dunkin said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to grand jury testimony, robbery homicide Detectives Philip Lewis 
Vannatter and Thomas Lange received telephone calls at home about 3 a.m. 
Vannatter arrived at the murder scene shortly after 4 a.m. and Lange, his 
partner, got there about 4:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The detectives testified that they stayed at Nicole Simpson's condominium 
until about 5 a.m., when they went to Simpson's nearby house on North 
Rockingham Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until 6:55 a.m. that police officially notified the coroner's 
office, Gilmour said. "They said, 'Wait, we'll call you back when we're ready,' 
" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmour said police called again at 8:10 a.m. and coroner's Investigator 
Claudine Ratcliffe was sent to the murder scene. She arrived at 9:05 a.m. but 
was asked to wait until shortly after 10 a.m. before she could approach the 
bodies and begin collecting evidence and performing the standard tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratcliffe took the bodies to the coroner's office Downtown about 12:20 p.m., 
Gilmour said. Golden testified that he relied on Ratcliffe's field observations 
and the contents of the victims' stomachs to place the deaths within a 
three-hour "range." 
</P>
<P>
 In all, records show, it was more than 10 hours between the time the bodies 
were discovered and the time Ratcliffe conducted those tests, including a liver 
temperature test. 
</P>
<P>
 Elapsed time from when the first LAPD detective arrived at the scene: about 
eight hours. Time from when robbery-homicide detectives Vannatter and Lange 
appeared: about six hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a long time," Gilmour said. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, he said, LAPD gave late notification in only four other 
homicides during June and the time lag ranged between three and five hours.

EXXON ORDERED TO PAY $5 BILLION FOR OIL SPILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN and MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A jury in Alaska on Friday ordered Exxon Corp. to pay $5 billion -- roughly 
what the company makes in a year -- as punishment for its recklessness in 
causing the worst oil spill in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11-member federal jury in Anchorage also assessed $5,000 against Joseph 
Hazelwood, who was captain of the tanker Exxon Valdez when it ran aground in 
Alaska's Prince William Sound on March 24, 1989, dumping 11 million gallons of 
crude oil into one of North America's richest fisheries. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is believed to be the largest punitive judgment ever, Friday's 
award was well below the $15 billion sought by the plaintiffs -- an estimated 
30,000 fishermen, Alaskan natives, property owners and others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's enough, but it should inflict some pain. There has to be 
retribution for what they did to us," said Jim Gray, a 48-year-old fisherman 
who led close to 100 boats last summer in a vain effort to blockade oil tankers 
trying to reach the now infamous oil terminus at Valdez in Prince William 
Sound. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last five years, the region has suffered poor salmon runs, shuttered 
fish processing plants, polluted fish farms, bankruptcies and other woes many 
blamed on the spill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Exxon came after the spill and said, 'Don't worry, we'll make you whole.' 
Then they turned around and fought us. You have a lot of resentment here," Gray 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 While huge, the award will not seriously threaten Exxon's financial health, 
investment analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Exxon is the most profitable company on earth," said J. Robinson West, 
president of Washington-based Petroleum Finance Co. "One should not trivialize 
$5 billion, but this company has the strength to survive this. Not many 
companies could." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, within 25 minutes of Friday's news reaching Wall Street, Exxon's stock 
jumped $1.50 a share to close at $60.25 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
Analysts said the jump reflected the market's relief that the verdict hadn't 
been harsher. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Exxon vowed to appeal. "This verdict is totally unwarranted and 
unfair," Exxon Chairman Lee Raymond said in a statement Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 He added: "It is excessive by any legal or practical measure. We will use 
every legal means available to overturn this unjust verdict, which is not a 
final judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 Plaintiffs' lawyer David W. Oesting said that Exxon's appeals might last 
another two to three years, but he predicted that the full award would be 
upheld. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's judgment is believed to be the largest punitive award ever, although 
it is not record-setting in terms of total damages. A Texas jury in 1985 hit 
Texaco with a $10.53-billion judgment for interfering with Pennzoil Co.'s 
attempt to purchase Getty Oil Co., but only $3 billion of that was punitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's verdict capped a grim summer in court for Exxon. In three phases of a 
trial begun in May, Exxon suffered major setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, the Anchorage jury found Exxon and Capt. Hazelwood to have been 
recklessly negligent, meaning that punitive damages could be awarded on top of 
actual costs to plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, in the trial's second phase, the jury awarded commercial fishermen 
$287 million for actual damages to their livelihood. This was less than a third 
of what the fishermen had asked for, and Exxon quickly announced that it would 
seek a reduction to reflect payments of $300 million it had already made to 
many of the plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the trial's second phase, Exxon also arrived at an independent 
settlement to pay 3,500 native Alaskans $20 million in place of food they would 
normally have caught in Alaskan waters. 
</P>
<P>
 Exxon also said it would try to lower the August judgment because the latest 
Alaska Department of Fish and Game data were showing twice as many sockeye 
salmon returning to Alaskan waters as were predicted in studies used in the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond, the Exxon chairman, said the company has also paid about $3.5 billion 
in cleanup costs, government fines and damage claims relating to the spill. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fishing village of Cordova, whose economy was hit hard by the spill, 
salmon fisherman Max McCarty had just spent Friday morning at the docks in 
pouring rain pulling the nets off his fishing boat when he heard about the 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't thrill me that much," McCarty said. "You know Exxon is going to 
fight this every penny of the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Totemkoff, president of Chenega Corp., an Alaskan native village 
corporation, was similarly restrained. "We are finally seeing some justice," he 
said. "But there are some things that can never be the same again." 
</P>
<P>
 With fish scarce and few ducks or sea lions to hunt since the oil spill, said 
Totemkoff, the natives have been prevented from practicing subsistence fishing 
and hunting methods that have continued for thousands of years. "There has been 
a break in that chain. There is a danger we won't be able to pass on the 
knowledge."

CLINTON DISPATCHES CARTER TO HAITI IN BID TO END CRISIS; CARIBBEAN: ONLY HOURS 
AFTER OFFICIALS SAID MILITARY ACTION WAS 'IMMINENT,' THE FORMER PRESIDENT, 
COLIN POWELL AND SAM NUNN ARE SENT TO TALK LEADERS INTO STEPPING DOWN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK NELSON, TIMES WASHINGTON BUREAU CHIEF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, in an extraordinary last-ditch effort to resolve the Haiti 
crisis peacefully, is dispatching a delegation headed by former President Jimmy 
Carter to the Caribbean nation to persuade its military dictators to relinquish 
power. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House announced the stunning development Friday afternoon only hours 
after senior national security officials had said that an invasion by U.S. 
forces was "imminent" and the President, in a televised address to the nation, 
had called on the American people to support military action. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, it was learned, has had a series of secret telephone conversations in 
recent days with Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, Haiti's military leader, and there 
apparently is a proposal on the table for a peaceful resolution to the crisis 
-- raising new White House hopes of removing the Haitian regime without risking 
U.S. lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegation, which is scheduled to fly to the Haitian capital of 
Port-au-Prince aboard a U.S. military plane today and meet with the generals 
over the weekend, includes retired Army Gen. Colin L. Powell, former chairman 
of the Joint Chiefs of Staff; Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), chairman of the Senate 
Armed Services Committee, and members of the Administration's national security 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 The new diplomatic initiative could lengthen what had been understood to be a 
very short timetable for military action to restore Haiti's democratically 
elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide. But officials insisted that it does 
not represent a change of policy or give the Haitian regime significantly more 
room for maneuver and delay. The delegation has "a very, very short time frame" 
in which to accomplish its mission, one senior official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter and his colleagues will be authorized to discuss with the Haitians only 
the means of their departure, the official said. If the leaders are serious 
about negotiating safe passage out of Haiti and sanctuary in another country, 
he added, their conversation will be short. 
</P>
<P>
 The official specifically ruled out a proposal -- for which Nunn once 
expressed support -- under which Cedras' departure would be tied to new 
elections in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he could give assurances that the mission would not lead to some sort 
of dilution of Clinton's insistence that the generals leave unconditionally, 
the official said: "Yes, yes, yes, yes. I can assure you of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's last-minute decision -- after telling the military dictators in his 
address to the nation Thursday: "Leave now or we will force you from power" -- 
left a massive military force assembled for an invasion sitting idle off the 
Haitian coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials said that the forces, including more than 20 ships 
and about 20,000 personnel, are still poised to swing into action if the Carter 
mission fails. 
</P>
<P>
 "No policy -- nothing -- has changed since the President's statement last 
night," an official said. "Nothing in this changes either the urgency of the 
situation or the timetable of our military preparations." 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials described the new move as an outgrowth of a process that 
began with the talks between Carter and Cedras. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Thursday, Carter informed Clinton that Cedras might be interested in 
meeting with Carter. Over the next 36 hours, Clinton, Carter, Nunn, Powell and 
National Security Adviser Anthony Lake conferred repeatedly in an attempt to 
nail down a plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell apparently knows Cedras from past contacts. And the fact that Powell is 
a widely respected military figure who headed the Joint Chiefs during the 
George Bush Administration lends an element of bipartisanship to the endeavor. 
An Administration official said that Nunn, who opposes Clinton's plan for an 
invasion, will tell the Haitian leaders that congressional opposition -- 
vociferous and widespread as it has been -- would be no bar to an invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing Friday at a charity fund-raising dinner in Macon, Ga., Nunn didn't 
seem optimistic about a diplomatic solution. "I hope we can bring about some 
resolution," he said. "I think the odds are against it, but I hope so in spite 
of it all." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are making the trip to solve the crisis without the loss of a single 
Haitian or American life," Powell said Friday night in Ashland, Ohio, where he 
spoke at a fund-raiser at Ashland University. 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanying Carter, Nunn and Powell will be Lawrence Rossin, the National 
Security Council's point man on Haiti, and Maj. Gen. Jared Bates, the chief 
assistant to Lt. Gen. John Sheehan, director of operations for the Pentagon's 
joint staff. 
</P>
<P>
 In Congress, most Republicans and many Democrats oppose Clinton's policy. And 
when Congress meets next week, there undoubtedly will be pressure for a vote on 
whether to support an invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Administration official, commenting on the prominent stature of the 
members of the Carter delegation, said that "dignity" is an important factor 
for the Haitian leaders. "It is important to them who they surrender their 
swords to," he said, speaking on the condition that he not be named. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why formal talks are needed if the only subject is the military leaders' 
departure, a senior official said: "The way in which they would depart is not a 
simple thing. There are a lot of issues involved in the manner of their 
departure, which I would prefer not to go into because we need to discuss it 
with them." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Panama said it would grant political asylum to Cedras if that would 
prevent a U.S. invasion. "We would give him asylum with pleasure, but not after 
an invasion," President Ernesto Perez Balladares said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and Carter had been conferring off and on about the Haiti crisis for 
some time, sources said. Their conversations became more urgent after Carter 
returned Tuesday to Atlanta from a two-week visit in Africa just as U.S. forces 
began massing off the Haitian coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Georgia governor was a natural emissary as Clinton sought to avoid 
an unpopular step -- a step one informed source said the President himself had 
privately expressed misgivings about taking. Carter served as the official 
monitor for the 1990 election when Haitians chose Aristide, who served as 
president only nine months before being ousted by the military. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter's contacts with Cedras, according to one official, were one of several 
possible "channels" to the Haitian leadership that the Administration had been 
using without being sure whether any of them would work. "A number of avenues 
were pursued," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were indications that the makeup of Carter's delegation was shaped in 
part by a newspaper opinion article by Joseph H. Blatchford, a Washington 
lawyer and former Peace Corps director. 
</P>
<P>
 Blatchford urged that Clinton name Carter to head a delegation to Haiti and 
suggested that Powell be included in the group. The piece, published on The 
Times' Op-Ed page last Tuesday under the headline "Another 11th-Hour Job for 
Jimmy Carter," was read that day by the former President, sources say, and 
ultimately affected the selection of Clinton's emissaries.  
</P>
<P>
 "Say what you will about the Carter presidency, his Camp David accords brought 
peace between Israel and Egypt," wrote Blatchford, who served in the Richard 
Nixon Administration. "His Panama Canal treaty was a major leap forward in 
U.S.-Latin American relations, and as ex-President, his initiative to force the 
Sandinistas to call elections brought democracy back to Nicaragua. The returns 
aren't yet in on his mission to North Korea, but so far it has proved useful to 
all sides." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, pressing his case for public support for the invasion plan only hours 
before the White House announced the Carter mission, told a group of 
journalists that he had been encouraged by indications that his speech Thursday 
had resulted in the U.S. public being "more supportive." 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials cited overnight polls showing increased public support 
after the speech. One poll by USA Today/CNN/Gallup of 371 people who viewed the 
speech showed support for an invasion up from 40% to 56%. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton noted that 24 nations have now joined the United States in an 
international coalition in support of an invasion if it becomes necessary and 
said, "I think we'll have more before very long." Most are small Caribbean 
nations, but the coalition includes Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Israel 
and Jordan as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton was interviewed when he appeared at a high-level briefing arranged for 
the journalists in the Roosevelt Room of the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher and five other senior officials who 
spoke on condition they not be identified directly conducted the briefing. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually known for his direct personal engagement with interviewers, Clinton 
appeared tired and somewhat distracted as he stood answering questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you nervous?" about the decision to press ahead against the generals, a 
journalist asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Am I nervous? No, I feel good about it. I don't know if good is the right 
word. I think the policy is right, and I think that I have done the best I 
could to present it to the American people and we have done the best we could 
to prepare. And I have enormous confidence in the work that others have done. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 "We don't live in a risk-free world, and there are risks associated with 
anything we did or didn't do. But I think we're doing the right thing and I 
think we have the right people doing the right thing. That's all I could ever 
ask for. And I've made the decision, so if it doesn't go right, I'm 
responsible." 
</P>
<P>
 There was no hint then that any last-minute effort might be made to stave off 
an invasion. In fact, the lengthy session focused mostly on how the United 
States intended to invade Haiti with minimal casualties on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 A national security official said that there would be an "overwhelming force" 
to minimize casualties, accomplish the mission quickly and permit U.S. troops 
to come home as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher said that after Clinton's speech Thursday night, "you're going to 
find support for this growing not only among the American people but on Capitol 
Hill as well." 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the Administration already had conducted 75 briefings on Haiti 
with members of Congress and was continuing to follow a heavy briefing schedule 
on Capitol Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the Administration has no plans to ask Congress to support the 
invasion plan. He pointed out that President Ronald Reagan did not seek formal 
congressional support for invading Grenada and that President Bush did not seek 
it before invading Panama. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I think it's appropriate for the President to exercise his authority as 
commander-in-chief in the situation, but to comply with the authorities in 
Congress that are effective as we move through the situation." 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials invited Caribbean prime ministers to the White House to 
help them make the case for the U.S. action. 
</P>
<P>
 Eugenia Charles of Dominica, who played an identical public role for Reagan a 
decade ago in support of the invasion of Grenada, said: 
</P>
<P>
 "We're determined that we should retain democracy in our part of the world. 
It's very important to realize, as small as we are, poor as we are, and with a 
population so little, that we do stand for all the good things that the world 
wants in their countries. And we believe that we must assist the Haitians to 
regain their democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Charles dismissed the idea advanced by some Republicans that, unlike Grenada, 
in this case U.S. interests are not at stake. "I'm not even sure your national 
interest was involved in Grenada. I am never quite sure what the American 
national interest is, frankly," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know what our national interest is, and I think we want peace and democracy 
in our area," she added. "And I will hope that the United States would feel it 
was not so far distant from our area; that in fact they share some of the same 
seas we share, and there, they should have some of the concerns that we have." 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials sought to rebut charges that Aristide was a radical 
who would impose his own dictatorship on Haiti if returned to power. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think President Aristide understands the dynamics of the marketplace and 
market economies, and that the way to grow is to have individual freedoms, free 
markets," said William H. Gray III, Clinton's special adviser on Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he is clearly aware that in this hemisphere, as well as throughout 
the world village, other forms of economic and political organizations have 
been in deep despair and in trouble and many of them have fallen under their 
own weight." 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy Berger, Clinton's deputy national security adviser, said Aristide 
"understands extremely well that it is not in his interest or in the interest 
of Haiti for there to be a period of recrimination." 
</P>
<P>
 Berger said Aristide probably would not return to Haiti until several days 
after U.S. forces occupy the island, which they are expected to do whether or 
not the military regime steps down voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously that depends to some degree on the conditions on the ground," he 
said.

EXXON ORDERED TO PAY $5 BILLION FOR OIL SPILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN and MICHAEL PARRISH, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A jury in Alaska on Friday ordered Exxon Corp. to pay $5 billion -- roughly 
what the company makes in a year -- as punishment for its recklessness in 
causing the worst oil spill in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
 The 11-member federal jury in Anchorage also assessed $5,000 against Joseph 
Hazelwood, who was captain of the tanker Exxon Valdez when it ran aground in 
Alaska's Prince William Sound on March 24, 1989, dumping 11 million gallons of 
crude oil into one of North America's richest fisheries. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is believed to be the largest punitive judgment ever, Friday's 
award was well below the $15 billion sought by the plaintiffs -- an estimated 
30,000 fishermen, Alaskan natives, property owners and other residents. 
</P>
<P>
 While huge, the award will not seriously threaten Exxon's financial health, 
investment analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Exxon is the most profitable company on earth, the highest net income," said 
J. Robinson West, president and CEO of Washington-based Petroleum Finance Co. 
"One should not trivialize $5 billion, but this company has the strength to 
survive this. Not many companies could." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Exxon vowed to appeal. "This verdict is totally unwarranted and 
unfair," Exxon Chairman Lee Raymond said in a statement Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 He added: "It is excessive by any legal or practical measure. We will use 
every legal means available to overturn this unjust verdict, which is not a 
final judgment. It will be reviewed and we trust it will be modified by the 
trial court or by appellate courts." 
</P>
<P>
 Plaintiffs' lawyer David W. Oesting said that Exxon's appeals might last 
another two to three years, but he predicted that the full award would be 
upheld. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's judgment is believed to be the largest punitive award ever, although 
it is not record-setting in terms of total damages. A Texas jury in 1985 hit 
Texaco with a $10.53-billion judgment for interfering with Pennzoil Co.'s 
attempt to purchase Getty Oil Co., but only $3 billion of that was punitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's verdict capped a grim summer in court for Exxon. In three consecutive 
trials, Exxon suffered major setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, the Anchorage jury found Exxon and Capt. Hazelwood to have been 
recklessly negligent, meaning that punitive damages could be awarded on top of 
actual costs to plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, the jury awarded commercial fishermen $287 million for actual 
damages to their livelihood. This was less than a third of what the fishermen 
had asked for, and Exxon quickly announced that it considers that subject to 
adjustment, "including a reduction to reflect payments already made by Exxon to 
many of the plaintiffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the spill, Exxon announced a claims program in which it paid out 
$300 million to more than 11,000 parties, some of whom were represented in this 
case.  
</P>
<P>
 At the time of the second trial, Exxon also arrived at an independent 
settlement to pay 3,500 native Alaskans $20 million in place of food they would 
normally have caught in Alaskan waters. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond, the Exxon chairman, said the company has also paid about $3.5 billion 
in cleanup costs, government fines and damage claims relating to the spill. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs' first reaction when they were reached Friday afternoon was to 
speculate if the award would be enough to make Exxon squirm. In the past five 
years, the region has suffered poor salmon runs, shuttered fish processing 
plants, polluted fish farms, bankruptcies, divorce and even suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it's enough, but it should inflict some pain. There has to be 
retribution for what they did to us," said Jim Gray, a 48-year-old fisherman 
who led close to 100 boats last summer in a vain effort to blockade oil tankers 
trying to reach the now infamous oil terminus at Valdez in Prince William 
Sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "Exxon came after the spill and said, 'Don't worry, we'll make you whole.' 
Then they turned around and fought us. You have a lot of resentment here." 
</P>
<P>
 In the fishing village of Cordova, whose economy was hit hard by the spill, 
salmon fisherman Max McCarty had just spent Friday morning at the docks in 
pouring rain pulling the nets off his fishing boat when he heard about the 
verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 "It didn't thrill me that much," McCarty said. "You know Exxon is going to 
fight this every penny of the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Totemkoff, president of Chenega Corp., an Alaskan native village 
corporation, was similarly restrained. "We are finally seeing some justice," he 
said. "But there are some things that can never be the same again." 
</P>
<P>
 With fish scarce and few ducks or sea lions to hunt since the oil spill, said 
Totemkoff, the natives have been prevented from practicing subsistence fishing 
and hunting methods that have continued for thousands of years. "There has been 
a break in that chain. There is a danger we won't be able to pass on the 
knowledge."

NEWS ANALYSIS; 11TH-HOUR ENVOYS OPEN ESCAPE ROUTE FOR CLINTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOYLE MCMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For months, ever since President Clinton and his aides began seriously 
considering a U.S. invasion of Haiti, they have hoped against hope for one 
unlikely outcome: that Haiti's brutal rulers somehow would surrender without a 
fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would be quite a victory," a close Clinton aide mused recently. It would 
relieve Clinton's deep personal uneasiness about sending U.S. troops into 
battle, especially in an unpopular cause. And it would offer a badly needed 
policy triumph to a President who has seen too many of his domestic and 
international initiatives go awry. 
</P>
<P>
 This tattered hope of escaping military conflict, with its special resonance 
for a young President who avoided military service and opposed the Vietnam War, 
lay behind Clinton's surprise announcement Friday that he is sending special 
envoys to Haiti this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's unhappiness at the prospect of a military clash has been palpable: 
One visitor who saw the President on Friday said that he spoke of the prospect 
of war without passion or conviction, as if he still had not made up his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 And in political terms, as Clinton knows from his 1992 campaign against George 
Bush, even a military victory like the 1991 Persian Gulf War would be no 
guarantee of long-term presidential success. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said they had largely given up hope for a negotiated end to the 
standoff with Haiti's military rulers until Thursday, when former President 
Jimmy Carter relayed a message from the regime's leader, Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, 
asking for talks about the junta's terms of departure.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials are still not sure that the Haitians are serious, but they are 
willing to find out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The word dignity has figured in quite a few of the feelers we have received 
from them," one official said. It is as if the generals want to know how they 
would "surrender their swords," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So with that slight encouragement, the idea of sending three distinguished 
Americans on a last-minute negotiating mission, even if its prospects of 
success are slim, offered Clinton one final hope for escape from a war he does 
not relish. 
</P>
<P>
 So eager was Clinton to try this one last chance at a peaceful outcome that he 
agreed to send Carter, retired Gen. Colin L. Powell and Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) 
to Haiti -- even though the message from Cedras was ambiguous: agreeing to 
talks about his departure without clearly saying he is ready to go. 
</P>
<P>
 Top officials acknowledge that they still do not know what Cedras and the 
other Haitian leaders -- army chief of staff Brig. Gen. Philippe Biamby and 
police chief Lt. Col. Michel-Joseph Francois -- have in mind: whether they want 
to take the Administration's offer of a CIA-supplied safe passage out of Haiti 
and a comfortable exile in South America, or whether they really intend, as 
they have said, to fight to the death. 
</P>
<P>
 For weeks, U.S. officials have been receiving "feelers" from people claiming 
to represent Cedras or Biamby or Francois. Most turned out to be insubstantial. 
</P>
<P>
 But Carter's messages this week came directly from Cedras to the former 
President, so they at least had the virtue of being authentic. 
</P>
<P>
 Nunn and Powell were added to the mission for several reasons. One, although 
officials did not want to admit it, is to keep an eye on Carter, who 
embarrassed Clinton in June by launching free-lance negotiations with North 
Korea (although officials now say they are pleased with the way that effort 
turned out). 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also asked Nunn, who has opposed an invasion of Haiti, to explain 
clearly to Cedras that Congress is not, as a practical matter, going to stop 
the military action from going ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 And Powell was asked to participate because his stature as a famous retired 
general is expected to draw respect from the Haitian officers.  
</P>
<P>
 Their presence on the delegation could also have the effect of disarming 
domestic opposition to Clinton's policy in Haiti, even if only slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 Many members of Congress had called on the President to send a final 
diplomatic offer to Haiti before launching an invasion. Senate Minority Leader 
Bob Dole (R-Kan.) even suggested Powell for the job -- little dreaming that 
Clinton might take him up on it. 
</P>
<P>
 In that sense, even if Clinton's three emissaries fail, the mission will have 
symbolic value -- showing critics, both at home and abroad, that the President 
went the extra mile to seek a diplomatic arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end, officials agreed, Clinton's main motive was simpler: He just 
doesn't want to go to war. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides said they have been mystified by the charge from some Republicans that 
Clinton believes that a successful military campaign will boost his popularity. 
Even a few deaths among U.S. forces, or among American citizens in Haiti, could 
come back to haunt him, they noted. And they foresee possible trouble down the 
road if U.S. troops remain on peacekeeping duty in Haiti, as expected, into the 
presidential election year of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who thinks we want to invade for political reasons," one official 
said wryly, "isn't looking at the polls." A High-Profile Team 
</P>
<P>
 A look at the envoys who were asked by President Clinton on Friday to go to 
Haiti and meet military leaders there in what could be a final effort to avoid 
a U.S.-led invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 JIMMY CARTER 
</P>
<P>
 Whether he's wielding hammer and nails on a low-income house or the weight of 
his office in world affairs, Carter has hardly stopped trying to build things 
since he lost the presidency in the 1980 election. Carter, 69, and the Carter 
Center he set up have monitored elections in about a dozen countries, promoted 
child immunization and human rights in the Third World, and worked for the 
betterment of America's inner cities. He is credited with negotiating a freeze 
on North Korea's nuclear program and arranging for North-South talks earlier 
this year.. 
</P>
<P>
 COLIN POWELL 
</P>
<P>
 The former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff may be going to Haiti to 
explore peace, but he also had a hand in shaping the strategic thinking of the 
invasion force now massed against Haiti. Before retiring last year after a 
35-year career in the armed forces, America's top military officer moved to 
increase cooperation among the services with reforms that would be put to their 
first big test in a Haiti invasion. His authoritative, soothing manner during 
the Persian Gulf War made him a media star and raised expectations he might run 
for the presidency. Powell, 57, has been working on his biography. 
</P>
<P>
 SAM NUNN 
</P>
<P>
 The chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, Nunn (D-Ga.) has 
expressed reservations about invading Haiti, saying the crisis there was not a 
vital U.S. interest and restoring democracy would be a long-term commitment. 
Nothing big that happens in the military, and not much in foreign affairs, 
escapes the scrutiny of Nunn, 56, one of Washington's most powerful men. He 
voted against authorizing force in the lead-up to the Persian Gulf War when 
Republican George Bush was president and has sometimes been at odds with 
Democrat Bill Clinton. But White House officials said in January they had asked 
Nunn to become defense secretary, and he refused.

UCI AIMING FOR RANKS OF TOP RESEARCH SCHOOLS; EDUCATION: CHANCELLOR LAUREL L. 
WILKENING UNVEILS HER LONG-AWAITED VISION FOR UNIVERSITY'S PLACE IN 21ST 
CENTURY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DI RADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a long-anticipated restatement of UC Irvine's academic mission, Chancellor 
Laurel L. Wilkening unveiled a sweeping plan Friday to propel the young campus 
into the ranks of the nation's top 50 research institutions by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 To cope with ever-looming state budget constraints that have dramatically 
sliced university funds in recent years, Wilkening will challenge her faculty 
to sharpen its focus on obtaining research grants from government and the 
private sector. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want UCI to be the university of the 21st Century, and I don't think one 
exists right now," Wilkening said in a discussion with Times editors and 
reporters Friday. "We can get a jump on our competitors." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkening contended that the rededication to research will not come at the 
expense of the university's 15,000 students, who already complain that faculty 
members are spending less and less time in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI cannot provide the attention of a small liberal arts college, Wilkening 
said, but "the undergraduate program is a very strong program." However, she 
said that the issue of how to keep faculty members in the classroom teaching 
while also increasing research has not been resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkening said that few of her recommendations are controversial, adding that 
a UCI dean called them "all motherhood and apple pie." But some programs are 
likely to be reshaped or reviewed at the 29-year-old university. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 * Wilkening ordered the elimination of the comparative culture program. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wilkening will consider closing the physical education department. 
</P>
<P>
 * She recommended that interdisciplinary programs, such as Asian American 
studies and Chicano/Latino studies, be placed within other departments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Campus officials will consider making a project -- either independent 
research or a senior thesis -- mandatory for seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Officials will also decide if communication skills, cultural diversity 
issues and computer researching skills should be injected into every major on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 * Deans will be asked to review the cost and benefits of keeping open 
departments that have fewer than seven full-time faculty members. 
</P>
<P>
 Her announcement about the future of the campus, and which departments will 
grow, ended a long summer of anticipation for members of the UCI community. 
Many have been looking to her for direction on restructuring the university 
nestled in the grassy hills of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Two panels of UCI professors and administrators suggested in reports released 
earlier this year ways to make vast cuts in academic and non-academic programs. 
They concluded that several departments, including the education department, 
physical education department and comparative culture program, should be 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
 UCI's education department was spared the knife in Wilkening's plan Friday. 
"The department's emphasis on the use of technology in the classroom is 
progressive and is well-received by educators in the K-12 schools," Wilkening 
said in her report, adding that abolishing the department would be a great 
error. 
</P>
<P>
 She also noted the potential for the education department to obtain national 
grants for work with Orange County children. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the chancellor wants is for the departments to come up with some 
innovative ways to go about our business, which is hard to do when there isn't 
any money," said Juan Bruce-Novoa, head of the Spanish and Portuguese 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 That lack of money from the state draws frequent sighs from members of the UCI 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Students talk about taking full-time jobs to pay for fees that have been 
increasing about 10% each year. This quarter, they're up to $1,444 at UCI -- a 
far cry from the state Legislature's command 125 years ago that admission and 
tuition for UC schools be free to all California residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Some staff members are losing jobs as departments slowly pare expenses. About 
$10 million was slashed from UCI's budget this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 And faculty members note that their salaries were restored this year after a 
5% pay cut last year, but that they haven't seen cost-of-living raises in four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkening said that during her first 14 months, she felt compelled to stay out 
of the debates about the campus' future in order to encourage discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I share a lot of the concerns the faculty has had, and I share some of the 
gripes about administration," Wilkening said. "That's why we're making moves 
toward streamlining." 
</P>
<P>
 UC President Jack Peltason -- Wilkening's predecessor at UCI -- praised her 
vision for the campus.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've all had to re-establish priorities, think about our goals and what we 
want to do," Peltason said. "This is a very thoughtful report, one that makes 
it very clear the campus has gone through a lot of consulting and thinking 
about the future." 
</P>
<P>
 On the whole, Wilkening avoided the controversial closures of several graduate 
schools that had characterized the painful contraction process a year ago at 
UCLA. Those who expected a major restructuring of UCI were left wondering what 
Wilkening's vision means in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no smoking gun anywhere in it," said one long-term faculty member who 
asked not to be identified. "A lot of people around here are going to breathe 
great sighs of relief; it's going to be business as usual." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce-Novoa said he didn't expect big surprises in Wilkening's report. "She 
has listened, she's had meetings, there's been no breakdown in communication," 
he said. "People are not in a crisis mood." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of dramatic restructuring and cutting, Wilkening emphasized pulling 
more research dollars into UCI by encouraging contracts between campus 
researchers and Southern California biotechnical and biomedical companies. Her 
goal, published in a tabloid-size, eight-page newspaper distributed around the 
UCI campus Friday, is to shoot UCI into the top 50 research universities 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 She stressed that there are several subjects that major foundations are 
interested in funding in the post-Cold War era: biomedicine, children and 
families, the environment and international affairs, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 To emphasize certain academic areas that have potential for attracting 
research and attaining excellence at UCI -- including biological sciences, 
medicine, information and computer science -- Wilkening said some academic 
disciplines might have to scale back in size. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may be shrinkage" in the number of faculty in some departments, she 
said, declining to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 In the future, some disciplines, such as classics, for example, might have to 
share professors with other UC campuses, and students at UCI may take televised 
classes, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students were encouraged by the chancellor's high goals for the 
university, but worried about the emphasis on research. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her goal to put UCI into the top 50 is attainable," said Matthew Buttacavoli, 
an undergraduate who is active in student government. "My question is, if they 
can't find funding, will she sacrifice undergraduate programs or student 
services or student athletics?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkening said she doesn't expect to see the campus cut its intercollegiate 
athletics, but she added that decisions on cutting student services will depend 
on what students tell her during the upcoming year.  
</P>
<P>
 "What we really need is some creative thinking about how we do business here," 
UCI graduate student Bryan Hannegan said. "Can we do more with less, for more 
students?" 
</P>
<P>
 Yushan Wu, 29, a doctoral student in the East Asian languages and literature 
department, read the plan during her lunch. She said she understood the need to 
put resources into sciences but was concerned about the future of her own 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our program needs a lot of nurturing and I hope we won't be neglected," Wu 
said. "I think our program has a lot of potential." 
</P>
<P>
 Comparative culture professor Raul Fernandez said closing his program wouldn't 
bother him if it were followed with the "rational restructuring of ethnic 
studies."  
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't have to mean it will be the end of ethnic studies," Fernandez 
said. "It remains to be seen, but if the record is any evidence, it is going to 
be an uphill battle." 
</P>
<P>
 Comparative culture allowed undergraduate students to take courses about Asian 
American studies, African American studies and other subjects, and major in a 
comparative study of the areas. That will no longer be the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction to the change remains to be seen. But last year, more than 100 
student protesters occupied the chancellor's office to pressure UCI for more 
Asian American studies teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Prof. R. Bin Wong, director of Asian American studies, is awaiting the effects 
of Wilkening's plan. Because of limited money, some people worry that ethnic 
studies drain cash from other departments -- but he disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not yet achieved the level of commitment and breadth of commitment to 
develop these programs, and we really need that," Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other students said they were skeptical about UCI's future. 
</P>
<P>
 Incoming freshman Alexandra Rundel, 18, of Laguna Beach said she fears the 
chancellor's vision will mean bolstering research programs and neglecting 
classroom instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never supported this direction in the UC system," said Rundel, who plans 
to apply to Columbia University after one quarter at UCI. "There's just an 
overemphasis on research instead of helping students, and that's the 
university's whole reason for being." 
</P>
<P>
 Some UCI faculty disputed that fear, saying that better researchers make 
better teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Undergraduates will profit -- the quality of undergraduate education is a 
function of the quality of faculty," said Dr. Michael E. Selsted, a pathology 
professor and the university's top grant-getting researcher for 1993-94.

VALLEY CHAMBERS VOTE TO SUPPORT PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Following an emotionally charged debate that continued for months, 
representatives of the San Fernando Valley's 21 chambers of commerce this week 
voted to support Proposition 187 -- the controversial state initiative seeking 
to restrict health and education benefits for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber members, representing more than 8,500 mostly small and 
medium-sized Valley businesses, had been split over support of the measure 
because they disagreed on whether Proposition 187 would do what proponents say 
it will. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamber representatives said they agreed that illegal immigration has become a 
costly local problem that is being ignored by government decision-makers. But 
they differed on how to approach the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are saying, 'I don't like this Third World takeover,' " said Guy 
Weddington McCreary, a North Hollywood Chamber of Commerce member favoring the 
initiative. "It is literally an invasion and very upsetting." 
</P>
<P>
 But others countered that the Valley's lingering economic troubles, as well as 
demographic and other social changes, are not likely to be reversed with 
passage of the proposition. They point to additional costs and responsibilities 
the measure would create. Besides restricting government services, it would 
require local authorities to report suspected illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't feel that requiring medical and educational personnel to be INS 
cops was appropriate," said James Stewart, member of the Mid-San Fernando 
Valley Chamber of Commerce, which voted against support of Proposition 187. "We 
know we have an illegal immigration problem. But the solution is to do a better 
job at the border. This doesn't do anything besides create more bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-10 vote on Wednesday supporting the initiative by the San Fernando 
Valley's United Chambers of Commerce is largely symbolic. Even so, chamber 
members say the debate has been one of the most emotional in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of people got really hot about it and that's not real common," 
Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamber members said they did not believe support of the measure would cost 
them customers because of its broad support. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Valley business owners supporting the measure say it has caught fire 
among longtime residents unhappy with growing numbers of low-income families, 
many of them Latino, now living in the sprawling Los Angeles suburb that was 
once nearly all white and predominantly middle-class. 
</P>
<P>
 McCreary -- who says his family moved to North Hollywood 107 years ago and was 
instrumental in its development -- said support for the measure is largely 
economic. 
</P>
<P>
 He said many taxpayers fear paying increasingly larger shares of their income 
to support the families of illegal immigrants. He cited a report commissioned 
by the Clinton Administration and released this week estimating that California 
taxpayers pay $1.6 billion a year to educate and incarcerate illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The report -- written and researched by the Urban Institute, a Washington 
think tank -- estimates that the costs of serving illegal immigrants exceed 
what they pay in taxes and other revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 But the measure is about more than money, McCreary said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people move in here, they aren't being assimilated," said McCreary, who 
is a property manager. "We've got to get a handle on it or else." 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of talk is fueling a lot of support for the measure, said Scott 
Macdonald, spokesman for Taxpayers Against 187. "But 187 doesn't solve the 
problem. It does nothing at the border," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodland Hills Chamber of Commerce -- the Valley's largest with 1,000 
members -- agrees. They voted to oppose the measure, saying it would do little 
to reduce illegal immigration and, with restrictions on medical care, could 
make matter worse. Debate over support of the measure was also split, but both 
sides agreed it is a problem that government has been unable to fix. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, Woodland Hills attorney Gary Barr said he sees history 
repeating itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Proposition 13 wasn't the greatest of measures, but it tapped into feelings 
that government wasn't willing to do anything about the property tax problem," 
Barr said. "The reason there is such broad support is because people know there 
is a problem and they don't believe government has done anything to solve it." 
</P>
<P>
 Results of a statewide Times poll released earlier this week show that 
Proposition 187 is supported by virtually all groups, including Latino voters. 
Among all registered voters, the measure is favored 62% to 28%, an overwhelming 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Lois Klein, a member of the United Chambers of Commerce, said no one is even 
sure whether Proposition 187 is constitutional. A portion seeks to keep 
children who are in the country illegally from attending California schools. 
That would contradict a 1982 Supreme Court ruling that undocumented children 
are entitled to a public education. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, said Klein, "It is something to shake the state up and, hopefully, 
force legislators to do something." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce is scheduled to discuss support of 
the initiative next week.

O.C. GROUP RAISES THE ANTE IN EFFORT TO KEEP RAMS HERE; SPORTS: A BEVY OF 
PERKS, AND A GUARANTEED $15 MILLION OR MORE A YEAR, ARE PROMISED IN WHAT IS 
CALLED A FINAL OFFER.

 With St. Louis and Baltimore knocking hard at the Rams' door, the Orange 
County contingent trying to keep the team in Southern California upped the 
stakes Friday, presenting the Rams with a package which would assure the team 
revenues of between $15 million to $20 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, the new proposal also includes the all-important season 
ticket and luxury box guarantees offered by other cities wooing the team. 
</P>
<P>
 In a two-hour meeting at the Rams' Los Angeles headquarters Friday, members of 
the Save the Rams task force promised team officials sales of 45,000 season 
tickets and the income from roughly 100 luxury boxes -- mostly from within the 
Orange County business community. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also boosted the renovation package for Anaheim Stadium from the $40 
million offered last month to $60 to $70 million, and included a definite 
timetable for completion of the renovations. 
</P>
<P>
 The new package also more than doubles -- from about $5 million to $12 million 
-- the budget for a proposed state-of-the-art training facility and corporate 
headquarters in Orange. The facility would be built on the 26-acre site of the 
Stadium Drive-In across the Santa Ana River from the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Rams President John Shaw's only public comments Friday were that he was taking 
the new proposal under consideration. But Shaw told Save the Rams members he is 
speeding up the timetable and could make a decision about the team's future in 
the next four to six weeks. He plans to respond to the latest Save the Rams 
proposal within the next two weeks, task force members said. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's meeting was attended, for the first time, by Dale (Chip) Rosenbloom, 
owner Georgia Frontiere's son with the late Rams owner Carroll Rosenbloom. Save 
the Rams members said Rosenbloom asked a number of pointed questions about the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that Chip Rosenbloom is there is (a sign) that we're being taken 
more seriously," said Orange County Supervisor William G. Steiner, who attended 
the meeting. "The important thing is the process is continuing. The door has 
not been shut. (Shaw's) been characterized as having made up his mind. Well, he 
sure asked a lot of questions (Friday)." 
</P>
<P>
 Save the Rams co-chairman Leigh Steinberg said he was optimistic Friday's 
offer would put Anaheim in strong contention to keep the team -- without 
"imperiling the financial stability" of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "The irony of all this is that it took the Rams talking about leaving to put 
together the type of deal that would have made them very happy all along," said 
Steinberg, a Newport Beach sports agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg said the package presented Friday included changing the name of team 
to Orange County Rams and "a commitment in terms of quality of on-field product 
and marketing and promotion of the team in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 A proposal to buy a minority share of the team continues to be part of the 
package, though not a focus, Steinberg said. But a new proposal that would have 
had a local group buying the team for an estimated $150 million to $200 million 
was quickly quashed by Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are not interested in that proposal, so no time was spent on that at 
all," Steinberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also addressed Shaw's publicly voiced concerns about Anaheim 
Stadium's co-tenants, the baseball California Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Angels are critical to this process," said Steinberg, who declined to 
elaborate on specific plans. He said the idea is to build a new baseball 
stadium in the same general area as the existing stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear if a renegotiated lease at Anaheim Stadium is part of the Save 
the Rams new financial proposal. Steinberg said the lease will have to be 
rewritten and that a proposed Orange County Sports Authority, a 
quasi-governmental agency that would tend to the financial and promotional 
needs of county sports entities, will likely take charge of the new rental 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 The Save the Rams' new proposal -- with its promises of $15 million to $20 
million in revenues -- levels the playing field between the Save the Rams group 
and suitors in Baltimore and St. Louis. Baltimore has projected revenues of $28 
million and St. Louis has promised profits in the $20-million range. 
</P>
<P>
 The new offer comes one day after St. Louis officials finally resolved a new 
stadium lease dispute that for months had hampered that city's efforts to land 
an NFL team. 
</P>
<P>
 A $258-million, 70,000-seat domed stadium under construction in St. Louis is 
scheduled to be completed in the fall of 1995, and a St. Louis delegation is 
expected to travel to Los Angeles soon to resume negotiations with the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to give the Rams a damn good offer to play in the finest facility 
in the NFL in a large TV market that's ready for football," said Mac Scott, 
director of communications for the St. Louis county executive's office. "We're 
competitive because we have a state-of-the-art stadium that will be ready to 
play in next fall. No other city in the country has that." 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement released through the Burson-Marsteller public relations firm, 
Shaw said the Rams' lawyers "have been advised by (former Missouri) Sen. 
(Thomas) Eagleton that the St. Louis stadium issues have been resolved and if 
that is the case the Rams are prepared to commence discussions." 
</P>
<P>
 Heidi Sinclair of Burson-Marsteller said she believed discussions would get 
underway quickly. "St. Louis is moving fast," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland Gov. William Donald Schaefer and Baltimore Orioles owner Peter 
Angelos are also scheduled to meet with Shaw in Los Angeles early next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond some fine-tuning, Save the Rams members said, Friday's proposal is 
their final pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe this is a totally ample and lucrative offer," Steinberg said. "I'd 
make the point again that the Rams have been loyally supported in Southern 
California for 50 years, and we've never intended to compete with financial 
offers from other municipalities. That would never make sense for Orange 
County."

O.C.'S JOBLESS RATE FALLS TO 5.9% IN AUGUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Orange County's jobless rate, reflecting a continuing revival of the local 
economy, fell to 5.9% in August from the July 6.6% level, according to 
preliminary state employment figures released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month's jobless rate matches the national level and is well below the 
state's 8.6% rate last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question that the economy and the employment picture are 
improving," said Anil Puri, chairman of Cal State Fullerton's economics 
department. The August figures are "in line" with projections for slow but 
continued local economic growth, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, 78,900 county residents were without jobs last month while 1.26 
million residents were working in Orange County and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 August's figure is a full percentage point lower than the county's 6.9% rate a 
year earlier, but the state Employment Development Department said that 
comparisons between the two shouldn't be made because federal calculations, 
from which jobless figures are derived, changed this year. Mainly, the U.S. 
Census Bureau now includes many more self-employed workers on its rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 With defense industry cutbacks especially, the number of self-employed workers 
will continue to grow and will help to further pull Orange County's economy 
from the long recession, said Esmael Adibi, director of Chapman College's 
Center for Economic Research. 
</P>
<P>
 One such self-employed worker, Roy Robbins, was laid off from his job as an 
engineer with Hughes Aircraft Co. 15 months ago and took advantage of a 
government retraining program for laid-off aerospace workers to start a 
mail-order company, Bad Moon Books, that sells rare books. Earlier this year, 
he and a partner opened the Book King rare and used bookstore in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like being a professional athlete, if you can do what you love doing," 
Robbins said. Though he works about 60 hours a week, "it feels like the 
equivalent of 30 hours at Hughes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes this week said that it plans to close most of its Fullerton operation 
and take more than 6,000 jobs from Orange County over the next 16 months, which 
likely will lead to, among other things, a new crop of self-employed workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Adibi pointed to a separate report issued Friday by the state employment 
department that shows that companies are hesitant to make new hires. Employers, 
fearing rising interest rates and unsure about how much health-care reform will 
eventually cost them, are instead sending additional work out to contractors, 
often self-employed people, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state agency said that Orange County employers cut 2,800 jobs from their 
payrolls in August from the previous month, mostly a result of teachers taking 
a break between summer school and the fall semester. The number of jobs here 
fell to an estimated 1,108,500 from 1,111,300 in July. 
</P>
<P>
 That survey, based on reports from employers, should show a gain in September, 
and more Orange County jobs should be created through the rest of the year, 
Puri said, "though it will still be moderate compared to a normal recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 Adibi said the state numbers, especially the latest preliminary figures for 
August, will be revised later and will show that additional jobs are being 
created. The state agency, he said, tends to overestimate job losses during a 
recession and underestimate job creation during a recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, there's no mistaking that jobs in technology and manufacturing 
continue to decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Layoffs at defense and aerospace firms over the last three years have caused a 
deep decline in high-tech work. High technology manufacturing jobs decreased by 
4,100 during the previous 12 months, and the Hughes consolidation will add to 
that. Neither Adibi nor Puri, though, believe that the Hughes cutbacks will 
have a significant impact on the county's economic recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturing in general lost 3,000 jobs over the same period. A gain of 2,300 
jobs, mainly in the seasonal activity of food processing, was offset by a loss 
of 5,300 jobs among makers of durable goods. Air-quality restrictions and other 
business roadblocks have long been pushing such manufacturers out of state. 
</P>
<P>
 Mergers and failures in the banking and thrift industries led the financial 
sector to lose 4,100 positions over the previous 12 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The services sector, as usual, showed gains as 4,700 jobs were created over 
the last 12 months. The biggest boost, 1,500 positions, came in business 
services, transportation and public utilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Ross Kerber contributed to this report. Unemployment Drops 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's jobless rate dipped to 5.9% in August, down from a 6.6% level 
in July and well below the August statewide level of 8.6%. Here's the 13-month 
trend: 
</P>

<P>
 Out on parole after doing time for armed robbery, Glen Cornwell was riding in 
a friend's car when they were stopped by police on a December night in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 On the front seat between the men was a knife, a 10-gram bag of rock cocaine 
and a pipe used for smoking the drug. Cornwell had a bag of marijuana in his 
shoe. His friend had a .45-caliber pistol in his waistband. Several hundred 
dollars was stuffed in a coat on the back seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the evidence of drug dealing, Cornwell's parole agent allowed him to 
remain free because the ex-convict had a job and showed signs of building a 
steady life outside prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Six months later he shot and killed a man in a robbery at a check-cashing 
store, police say. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornwell's case and others like it have focused new attention on the Wilson 
Administration's effort since 1991 to stop the costly cycling of wayward 
parolees back through the state's prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcomed by Democratic legislators and prison reformers, the concept seemed 
mild enough: Take the least dangerous of the thousands of ex-convicts who each 
year violate their parole, and give them drug treatment, job training or a bed 
in a homeless shelter instead of a few more months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 But now some victims and parole agents say the new policy was implemented more 
with an eye toward saving money than protecting lives. Why, they ask, should 
any parolee ever get a break? And Democratic challenger Kathleen Brown has 
seized on the policy as a central element of her campaign attack on Republican 
Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is Wilson's management of a vital but often misunderstood link in the 
criminal justice system. Midway between incarceration and freedom, parole in 
California involves 1,100 agents supervising the lives of about 85,000 felons 
readjusting to life outside prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The nature of parole has changed dramatically since the days when most inmates 
served open-ended terms -- 10 years to life, for example -- and a board 
appointed by the governor had wide discretion to release them from prison or 
keep them behind bars. Now, most felons receive fixed sentences and are freed 
automatically once they have served their time. The parole system's primary 
function is to monitor their behavior for up to three years after their 
release. 
</P>
<P>
 Parolees have limited civil rights. They must keep a parole agent informed of 
where they are living, and with whom, and of whether they are employed. An 
agent may order a parolee to provide a urine sample for drug testing and may 
search his or her home without a warrant. 
</P>
<P>
 If they are arrested for a new crime, parolees can be charged and tried in 
court like anyone else. But if the violation is minor, or the evidence is weak, 
the agent may take quicker action by recommending that the Board of Prison 
Terms revoke parole and return the felon to prison for up to one year without a 
new trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Parole agents may also decide to allow a minor violator to remain free -- a 
decision that inevitably leaves them open to second-guessing if an ex-convict 
later commits a serious crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, working with disgruntled parole agents, has uncovered about half a 
dozen murders and an equal number of serious assaults committed since 1991 by 
people who were allowed to remain on the streets after they had violated their 
parole. (One is Cornwell, who is now in jail awaiting a second murder trial 
after the first jury deadlocked, 11 to 1.) 
</P>
<P>
 Brown and other critics say these cases are the product of a system gone awry. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials counter that Brown has cynically focused on a few 
isolated cases of bad judgment or bad luck that could have happened under any 
governor. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are hundreds of thousands of these decisions every year, and the best 
the detractors are able to come up with is a handful," said Frank Russell, a 
parole administrator for the state Department of Corrections. 
</P>
<P>
 The very idea of the department being forced to defend its parole policies as 
tough enough would have been hard to imagine a few years ago, when criminal 
justice experts were clamoring for the state to reduce the number of parolees 
it sent back to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1980s, after years of relative stability, the number of parole 
violators returning to prison soared. By 1989, nearly half the inmates entering 
prison were being sent there not by the courts but by their parole officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers climbed for several reasons, according to analysts. 
</P>
<P>
 One was a fundamental shift in the state's sentencing laws. When former Gov. 
Edmund G. (Jerry) Brown Jr. was first elected in 1974, California still 
sentenced felons under an open-ended system that allowed the parole board to 
decide when to release an inmate. 
</P>
<P>
 Convicts were only paroled if they could show that they were rehabilitated and 
had ties to the community -- such as family or a job. If they violated parole, 
these ex-convicts could be returned to prison to serve the balance of their 
term -- a strong incentive not to commit crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 But legislators, driven by conservatives skeptical of rehabilitation and 
uncomfortable with the subjective nature of the parole system, in 1976 changed 
most sentences to fixed terms, after which convicts were automatically 
released. They were supervised for only a short time to smooth their transition 
to civilian life. 
</P>
<P>
 While the new law was supposed to make parole a less important part of the 
criminal justice system, it had the opposite effect. Inmates who did not have 
to prove they were ready for release were getting out and, with fewer sanctions 
hanging over them, committing new crimes in greater numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other factors in the 1980s added to the explosion in the number of 
parole violators returned to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 County jails, which once housed violators for short stays, came under court 
orders to reduce overcrowding and told the state to send the violators to 
prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 New and more powerful drugs hit the streets just as chemical drug testing 
became more practical and widespread, producing a surge in parolees caught with 
illegal substances in their systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislators made more crimes subject to automatic prison terms, prompting a 
rapid increase in the number of felons, and, as they were released, in the 
number of parolees. The parole agent work force grew in kind, bringing many 
inexperienced and lightly trained agents into the field at a time when the 
public was seen as demanding stricter handling of convicted criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a hybrid of police officer and social worker, these agents increasingly 
saw their jobs as enforcers rather than counselors. Their first instinct was to 
send violators back to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The prison return rate climbed steeply, from about 8 parolees per 100 in 1978 
to 67 per 100 a decade later, when it peaked. But even as the rate began to 
decline, a blue-ribbon commission of police, jailers, academics and reformers 
appointed by then-Gov. George Deukmejian concluded that returning so many 
parolees to prison for short stays was a waste of money with little or no 
public safety value. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, Deukmejian Administration officials already were re-examining their 
parole policies and practices. 
</P>
<P>
 What they found startled them: The most reliable way to predict whether a 
parolee would be returned to prison was the location of the parole office that 
had jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's parole offices, it turned out, were using widely differing 
standards for deciding when to revoke an ex-convict's parole. A parolee who 
tested positive for cocaine might get a slap on the wrist in one town but three 
months in prison somewhere else. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials concluded that many of these parolees would do as well if they were 
left in their communities as they would if they were sent back for short prison 
stays. Those with jobs and stable home lives, officials thought, might lose 
both after 60 days in prison and be even more dangerous upon their return. 
Officials then devised a more formal system for evaluating the risk presented 
by parolees and began massive training to implement it. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort to standardize decisions, begun in 1989, coincided with the 
deterioration of the state's fiscal condition, a time when pressure was 
mounting on the Department of Corrections to quell its ever-growing appetite 
for state dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Before long, under Gov. Wilson, the two tracks merged. 
</P>
<P>
 Middle-level managers in the Parole Division had long wanted to expand the 
availability of drug treatment and other services for parolees. Their 
opportunity came when prison officials, seeking to save money, asked for 
innovative ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone said: Put together some ideas about how to run things smarter," said 
Russell, the parole administrator. "The Legislature is on us, the blue-ribbon 
commission is on us. They've been characterizing us as failing badly. What are 
some other kinds of things we can do?" 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Russell and a colleague determined that the state was using 2,000 
prison beds annually to house inmates whose parole was revoked for drug use or 
such minor crimes as trespassing, disturbing the peace or providing false 
information to a police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 If these inmates were instead kept on the streets, the department estimated, 
the state could boost spending on homeless shelters, drug treatment, job 
training and other services, and still have money left over. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal was approved by Wilson's Finance Department, and the effect was 
immediate and dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 While in June, 1991, 54% of parole violators were allowed to remain free, by 
June, 1992, 70% were being let off with no additional prison time. The change 
meant that 1,000 or more parolees each month who otherwise would have been in 
prison were on the streets. Almost all of them were drug offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 Criminologists welcomed the change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of these people were serving 30, 60, 90 days in prison," said Jonathon 
Simon, a University of Miami law professor who wrote a book on the history of 
parole in California. "That's a very expensive and wasteful use of prison space 
and undercuts whatever effort might be going on in the community to stabilize 
the individual." 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent Schiraldi, a prison reform advocate who has accused the state of 
wasting money locking up nonviolent offenders, said the increased use of 
community programs for parolees made sense for both fiscal and public safety 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to make good, reasonable decisions and have a reasonably structured 
program for these guys so they don't just wallow out there in the community," 
said Schiraldi, who runs a program for parolees in San Francisco. "If you do 
that, you ought to hold your head high." 
</P>
<P>
 But some parole agents say the policy went too far. They say the 
Administration effectively created a quota system under which parole offices 
were pressured to stay within budgeted targets by reducing the number of 
violators they returned to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Internal memos released by the Department of Corrections show that in late 
1991, officials in the parole division's Sacramento headquarters decided that 
no more than 10% of parolees should be in prison at any given time. 
</P>
<P>
 Offices failing to meet their targets had all their referrals audited to 
determine if some parolees recommended for prison could be left safely in the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Parole agents say the message was clear. 
</P>
<P>
 "We give a lot of lip service to public safety, but in reality we're not 
providing it anymore," said Jim Haggenson, an assistant supervisor in a Solano 
County parole office. "We're pretending to provide it." 
</P>
<P>
 Board of Prison Terms member John Gillis, a former Los Angeles police 
detective and a Wilson appointee, also butted heads with Department of 
Corrections officials. He concluded in 1992 that the department was trying too 
hard to stem the growth in the number of inmates behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillis had a particular concern over the way the department was handling the 
cases of parolees who missed scheduled meetings with their parole agents and 
then were picked up by police. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had competing interests," Gillis said. "Mine was public safety and the 
Department of Corrections' was population." 
</P>
<P>
 But Craig Brown, undersecretary of the Youth and Adult Correctional Agency, 
said the importance of the targets has been exaggerated. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said that the goals have not been strictly enforced and that no employee 
has ever been disciplined for failing to comply. No parole office that wants to 
revoke an ex-convict's parole is ever told it cannot do so because it has used 
its allotted space in the prisons, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing arbitrary about this," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the policy change, the state is still sending parolees back to 
prison at a rate more than four times what it was in the 1970s, and the total 
number of parolees returned to prison in California each year exceeds that in 
the other 49 states combined. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Kathleen Brown says that is not enough. She wants to send parolees with a 
violent crime in their history back to prison for any violation. She also 
proposes jailing even nonviolent offenders who commit minor parole violations 
pending a hearing by the Board of Prison Terms to decide whether to revoke 
their parole. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials say Brown's proposal would cost several hundred million 
dollars a year to implement. Criminal justice experts, meanwhile, say her idea 
could be counterproductive by disrupting the rehabilitation of parolees, 
forcing them to lose jobs and homes at a time when they are barely clinging to 
the edges of law-abiding society. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob DeComo, a criminologist with the National Center on Crime and Delinquency, 
a San Francisco think tank, said professional parole agents should have the 
power to make these decisions, even if they sometimes make mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If someone is doing pretty well, they're working, their family situation is 
reasonably stable and they're in treatment, isn't that a pretty good prognosis 
that progress is being made?" DeComo asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "You jerk them off the street and pull them out of treatment, pull them out of 
their job, away from their family and then say, 'Isn't this a good thing?' When 
we try to make these across-the-board policies it is a problem. Discretion is 
an important part of making the system work." 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown's use of parole in the campaign almost certainly will make it more 
difficult for whichever candidate wins to seriously consider policies that 
would curb the explosion in the prison inmate population. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless every criminal is sentenced to life in prison without parole, most will 
get out, and some will hurt people again. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to make it mistake-proof, you never parole anybody," said 
Franklin Zimring, a UC Berkeley professor of law. Key Cases 
</P>
<P>
 Democrat Kathleen Brown charges that in at least a dozen cases, parolees who 
should have been returned to prison were left on the streets by the Wilson 
Administration and later committed serious crimes. Here are summaries of 
several of the cases cited by Brown, along with responses from the Youth and 
Adult Correctional Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 GLEN CORNWELL, 39 
</P>
<P>
 * Background: Served eight years in state prison for armed robbery; released 
in September, 1992. In December, he was arrested on suspicion of possession of 
cocaine, marijuana and a gun, but not charged. Parole agent concluded the 
cocaine and the gun did not belong to him; he was counseled not to use 
marijuana and allowed to remain free. Six months later, a Sacramento man was 
murdered during a robbery attempt. Cornwell has been charged with the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 * Response: At the time of his violation, Cornwell had a job and had not 
missed a parole meeting or failed a drug test. Over 10 months, he had 
progressed satisfactorily and met with his parole agent 21 times. Despite 
finding Cornwell in possession of marijuana, the agent decided to continue 
parole. 
</P>
<P>
 BRIAN FLETCHER, 26 
</P>
<P>
 * Background: Released in 1990 after serving time for drug possession, 
Fletcher had tested positive for cocaine twice before he and an accomplice 
blocked a San Diego freeway on-ramp and robbed and killed a woman driving with 
her brother and three children. Fletcher is now in prison for the murder. 
</P>
<P>
 * Response: Fletcher's parole agent used his discretion in allowing the 
ex-convict to remain free after testing positive for cocaine the first time. 
After testing positive again, Fletcher fled. The agent was preparing a report 
listing him as missing when Fletcher was arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 LEON MURPHY, 39 
</P>
<P>
 * Background: Released from prison in August, 1991, after serving a term for 
drug trafficking. Murphy tested positive for drugs four times in three months 
and in November was returned to prison for drug treatment. He was released in 
1992, and quickly tested positive again. This time he was referred for 
community drug treatment. He was later charged with killing a man in a 
Sacramento crack cocaine house. Murphy is serving time for voluntary 
manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 * Response: Prison officials say Murphy's case shows that even when 
ex-convicts are returned to prison and put through drug treatment, they often 
commit serious crimes after their release. 
</P>
<P>
 CEDRIC SINGLETON, 29 
</P>
<P>
 * Background: After serving time for auto theft and drug possession, Singleton 
was released in 1991. Later found in possession of marijuana and a five-inch 
knife, Singleton was jailed and a hearing was scheduled on whether to revoke 
parole. His parole agent's supervisor released him pending the hearing in 1992. 
One week later, he was accused of strangling a Pasadena man and raping and 
killing the man's girlfriend. He is awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
 * Response: Singleton was released pending the hearing because he had a job 
and a stable family environment. Parole officials say such releases are allowed 
in fewer than 1% of parole violations. 
</P>
<P>
 MICHAEL WYNN, 43 
</P>
<P>
 * Background: A registered sex offender paroled in 1992, Wynn violated his 
parole by using cocaine but was allowed to remain free. His level of 
supervision was downgraded despite a request from his parole agent for more 
frequent monitoring. A year later, Wynn was arrested in the stabbing murders of 
an 80-year-old woman and an 8-year-old boy. He is awaiting trial. 
</P>
<P>
 * Response: Corrections officials say the handling of the case was a judgment 
call on the part of parole supervisors, based on their evaluation of the danger 
he posed to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 RUBEN COSTALES, 29 
</P>
<P>
 * Background: His parole was revoked after he assaulted his wife and he was 
returned to prison for six months. Shortly after release in 1993, Costales was 
arrested on suspicion of breaking into his ex-girlfriend's home. He was jailed 
on a misdemeanor charge. Local authorities' request that he be held overnight 
was denied by the state Corrections Department. An hour later, he allegedly 
broke into the woman's house again and attempted to stab her. He was arrested 
and is back in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 * Response: Costales was not held overnight because he was arrested on a 
misdemeanor charge. Local police could have held him on a felony charge or 
asked a parole agent to place a misdemeanor hold on him, but did neither. 
Returned to Prison

<P>
 The percentage of ex-convicts returned to prison for violating parole has 
fluctuated widely during the past 20 years.

U.S. CAUTIONS ARISTIDE OVER DIVISIVE ACTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER and DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration has warned exiled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide that he can expect continuing U.S. support after he regains power only 
if he scrupulously follows Haiti's constitution and prevents his followers from 
taking revenge against the country's wealthy elite who opposed his return, U.S. 
officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a series of private meetings, Administration officials admonished Aristide 
to put aside the rhetoric of class warfare that marked his earlier career as a 
firebrand Roman Catholic priest and seek instead to reconcile Haiti's rich and 
poor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration also urged Aristide to stick closely to free-market 
economics and to abide by the Caribbean nation's constitution -- which gives 
substantial political power to the Parliament while imposing tight limits on 
the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide demonstrated in a high-profile speech at the White House on Friday 
that he is an apt pupil. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will not allow artificial lines to divide us," Aristide said. "Members of 
political parties, members of Parliament, civilians, members of the military, 
all Haitians, let us stand to rebuild our nation. . . . We say no to vengeance. 
We say no to retaliation. Let us embrace peace. When? Now. Is it too late? No. 
The time is now." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, Aristide has spoken of reconciliation for much of his three years 
of U.S. exile. His supporters say that Aristide is determined to help Haiti 
escape its own violent history. 
</P>
<P>
 But Aristide's critics on Capitol Hill have seized on a speech he made shortly 
after his December, 1990, election that seemed to sanction the killing by his 
supporters of political opponents. Although Aristide's backers claimed that the 
speech should not be taken literally, the Administration is concerned that 
Aristide could become an embarrassment if he reverts to his earlier rhetorical 
style. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials conceded that Aristide, a populist priest who was suspended by his 
Roman Catholic order for inciting class hatreds, is the biggest question mark 
in the Administration's Haiti policy. If Aristide reconciles Haiti's 
impoverished majority with the country's elite, the result would be a victory 
both for him and for U.S. policy. But if Aristide encourages his supporters to 
even scores after three years of repressive dictatorship, it will undercut a 
major rationale for U.S. action: ending the gross human rights violations of 
the military government. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks Aristide has met almost daily with senior U.S. officials and 
with potential members of his Cabinet to plan for his return to power. 
According to Aristide aides and U.S. officials, the meetings have taken place 
on the assumption that Aristide will soon regain the presidency either 
peacefully -- if Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the military leader, relinquishes power 
-- or as the result of a U.S. invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said they hope to install Aristide in the presidential palace 
in Port-au-Prince about 10 days after U.S. troops land, a schedule that an 
Aristide aide said is acceptable to the ousted president. These officials said 
Aristide's return will be marked by pomp and ceremony if security conditions 
permit. But if remnants of the Haitian army are staging terrorist raids, the 
arrival will be low-key. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials have urged Aristide to reach out to some of his 
political opponents in setting up his new government. The exiled president, who 
resisted such suggestions earlier, now has agreed to set up a broad-based 
coalition regime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do we encourage him to broaden his coalition? Do we encourage him to be 
inclusive?" State Department spokesman Mike McCurry asked Friday. "Do we 
encourage him to return to Haiti in the spirit of national reconciliation? Of 
course we do, but I think President Aristide has already indicated himself 
that's exactly his intent." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Administration official put it more bluntly: "For democracy to work, 
there has to be an understanding between Aristide and his opponents. Is he 
going to go the narrow route when he returns? We don't know. We've told him 
what we think. And there are some encouraging signs." 
</P>
<P>
 The official, who declined to be identified, said that the Administration has 
made it clear to Aristide that if he fails to reach a consensus with 
Parliament, the United States will not try to prop up his regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since Aristide established his exile home in Washington after the Sept. 
30, 1991, coup, his relationship with the U.S. government has been uneven. 
Although then-President George Bush called for the restoration of Haitian 
democracy, the deposed president always doubted the sincerity of the U.S. 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's inauguration in January, 1993, brought a brief honeymoon. But 
Clinton's former special adviser on Haiti, Lawrence Pezzullo, concluded that 
Aristide was unwilling to broaden his government or to cooperate with 
Parliament. Pezzullo left his post and subsequently became a severe critic of 
Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, the exiled president concluded for a time that Clinton was not 
serious about restoring Haitian democracy. Now, however, Aristide is satisfied 
that the U.S. government is doing everything necessary to bring him back to 
power. 
</P>
<P>
 "President Clinton, thank you for an historic message last night," Aristide 
said in his Friday speech to a White House gathering that included the 
President, Vice President Al Gore and representatives of the 24 countries that 
have agreed to provide troops to participate in a U.S.-led invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you said, there is no question that the people of Haiti want to embrace 
democracy. It is the restoration of democracy that will bring peace for all, 
reconciliation among all, respect and justice for every single citizen," 
Aristide said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the speech, and in recent radio broadcasts to Haiti, Aristide reached out 
to the island's wealthy business people, many of whom are supporters of the 
military government. 
</P>
<P>
 "I take this opportunity to say to the entire private sector, all the wealthy, 
all those in Haiti who have money: The time has come. Your president is happy 
to say to you . . . The Haitian government that protected you in the past is 
going to continue to protect your private business," Aristide said on Radio 
Democracy, a U.S.-funded station that broadcasts to Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 In his White House speech, Aristide seemed to transform himself from firebrand 
mystic to policy wonk concerned with the day-to-day work of government. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decline in national production by over 10% in 1992, the alienation of 
foreign investment, the accelerated depreciation of our currency and the 60% 
rise in inflation must be reversed," he said. "The security and stability that 
will come with the restoration of democracy will create the environment where 
growth is possible. The 140,000 jobs lost in the industrial sector will be 
restored." 
</P>
<P>
 He even tried to avoid inflated expectations, promising only to move 
economically "from misery to poverty with dignity."

PROP. 187 IS SORE SUBJECT FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT STUDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE CHAVEZ and SANDY BANKS, TIMES EDUCATION WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Her brown eyes filled with tears and she shook her head, unable to speak when 
asked what would happen if she were expelled from Belmont High School for being 
an illegal immigrant. 
</P>
<P>
 Roxana, a senior who is good in biology and plans to become a veterinarian, 
knows about Proposition 187 -- the measure that would forbid illegal immigrants 
to attend public schools. She knows that most voters support the November 
ballot measure and that Gov. Pete Wilson favors kicking students like her out 
of school. 
</P>
<P>
 But she refused Friday to let herself imagine what would happen to her plans 
for a future in Los Angeles if she were not allowed to finish school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like this is beginning to destroy me," said the 17-year-old, who has 
lived with an aunt here for eight years since both parents died in El Salvador. 
"I can't get a job because I have no green card. . . . What do they want me to 
do -- be on the streets? 
</P>
<P>
 "I try to keep my hopes, but I don't understand why people would want to do 
this to kids who have worked so hard to overcome so much." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials say there are probably more than 2,000 illegal immigrants 
among the 4,500 students at Belmont High near Downtown -- the biggest school in 
Los Angeles, located in the heart of a burgeoning port of entry for this 
country's newest arrivals.  
</P>
<P>
 Principal Augie Herrera calls the initiative shortsighted. "We have to educate 
these young people," he said Friday. "We have to teach them what we want them 
to learn here or they will learn what they think they need to know in the 
streets. This has long-range implications in our society." 
</P>
<P>
 Students said Friday that they are feeling befuddled, indignant and frightened 
by the Proposition 187 movement, which stands to profoundly affect their young 
lives. Most, like Roxana, responded with blank expressions and sad shrugs when 
asked to envision making a future in America without a formal education. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative would deny public education to children who cannot prove that 
they are here legally and would require school officials to verify students' 
legal status. On Thursday, Wilson said that he favors the measure and that 
California can no longer afford to educate an estimated 300,000 illegal 
immigrant students in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 That is not the way they expected America to treat them, said many Belmont 
students whose families brought them to this country illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why does this Pete Wilson want to discriminate against us?" asked Anna, 19, a 
senior from Mexico who, after a year and a half at Belmont, is one of the best 
students in her English as a Second Language class. "I thought this country was 
made from immigrants like me. I thought I had a right to show Americans that I 
can make something of myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Her classmates said Proposition 187 casts a pall over their futures, which for 
many were until now on a solid and traditional American path: Graduate from 
high school. Go to college. Get a job and make their parents proud. 
</P>
<P>
 "School is what can make my dreams come true," said Carlos, 18, an illegal 
immigrant from Mexico who has attended public schools for four years and wants 
to become an immigration attorney. "It is my only way to improve myself, stay 
out of gangs. If I can't go to school, I won't be able to become anything in 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos, like others, said that it will be very difficult to get anything but a 
low-paying job if he is not able to complete school. His family would suffer, 
he said, because he has pledged to help support them when he graduates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, when I become an adult, me and others like me will be angry with the 
government for taking our education away," he said. "There will be a whole 
generation of children in Los Angeles who fear or maybe even hate the 
government. There will be great battles." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the students said they had no choice but to come to Los Angeles, 
pulled from their home countries of Mexico, El Salvador or Guatemala by parents 
and relatives trying to unite families or build new lives here. 
</P>
<P>
 They said their education has been one of the few hopeful experiences in this 
country, where their parents often squeeze out livelihoods as minimum-wage 
factory workers, housecleaners, baby-sitters and short-order cooks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it is right or fair to take dreams away from children," said 
senior Mirza Madrid, 18, who is a legal resident, but who has many friends who 
are illegal immigrants. "It's hard enough for everyone as it is. Now Latino 
kids feel embarrassed and afraid to say where they are from." 
</P>
<P>
 Many say they believe racism is fueling the move to shove illegal immigrants 
further to the fringes of California society. "(It) makes you feel guilty, like 
you are a problem," said Jenny, 18, a senior from El Salvador. "But not all 
Latino people make trouble and break the law. If they do, they should be 
deported. But not all of us are like that." 
</P>
<P>
 But many of the students said that even though they are here illegally they 
have a right to a free public education because of the contributions their 
parents have already made to the economy of this state and because they intend 
to become productive taxpayers.  
</P>
<P>
 "My mother baby-sits for a white family in Beverly Hills," Anna said. "She is 
helping that American family. We buy things, we pay the taxes. And all I need 
is a chance to make myself better. It's not like I want this for nothing. I 
will pay society back with good work." 
</P>
<P>
 If Belmont is any indication, passage of Proposition 187 would remove students 
from campus, but would not result in an exodus of illegal children from this 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of these children came here alone and have nowhere to go," said Kathleen 
O'Connell, the school's bilingual education coordinator. "They're not going to 
start running for the border. They're going to find a way to stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Roxana, the senior who wants to be a veterinarian, said no one she knows would 
leave the country if they were expelled from school. "These are kids who are 
going to be on the streets if you don't let them go to school," she said. 
"Would that be better -- kids with no education and no hopes on the streets 
instead of in class trying to better themselves?" 
</P>
<P>
 Already, there is a thriving underground network that students can use to get 
phony copies of the documents necessary to find jobs, and Belmont Principal 
Herrera said he thinks Proposition 187 would create a new market for phony 
school documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would require school officials to verify the citizenship of 
students -- a provision that has alarmed teachers and generated opposition from 
the state's professional education organizations. Currently, schools collect 
data only on whether students are native English speakers; they do not ask 
about legal status. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very uncomfortable position to be in," said Belmont biology teacher 
Greg Estrella. "These kids trust us. We go into this profession because we want 
to educate children, not decide who gets an education. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there'd be a lot of teachers who'd leave the state rather than carry 
this out. I know I'd think about that."

MIDEAST; CONCERN GROWING FOR MISSING IRAQI REPORTER; SUBHY HADDAD DISAPPEARED 
AFTER BEING SUMMONED BY POLICE IN JANUARY. FAMILY HAS FOUND NO TRACE OF HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For 30 years, Subhy Haddad has been a fixture in the world of Iraqi 
journalism. Local and foreign news agencies came to depend on his cautious, 
accurate reports from Iraq's capital. 
</P>
<P>
 When a visiting foreign correspondent arrived here, he inevitably was welcomed 
into Haddad's office for a chat and a cup of tea. After years of working for 
such respected news agencies as Reuters and the Associated Press, Haddad, 55, 
was hired on at a good salary for the Japanese daily newspaper Asahi Shimbun. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Tokyo -- and much of the rest of the world -- wants to know: Where is 
Haddad? 
</P>
<P>
 His reports abruptly stopped at the beginning of this year, when he was 
summoned for what was to be a brief interview with Iraqi secret police. He 
reassured his worried wife, kissed her goodby and left for the police station. 
</P>
<P>
 No one has heard from him since Jan. 27. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Neriman, recalled of her husband's disappearance: "A call came from 
Iraqi intelligence at about 8 in the morning. They asked him to be there at 
8:30. He said, 'But I can't, I have to take a shower first.' They said it would 
be better for him to be on time. 
</P>
<P>
 "He went there, and after two hours they came and searched the house," she 
said. "They took all of his telexes, all his communications with Asahi and 
copies of his articles. And that was it." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone familiar with Iraqi intelligence agencies knows that this story, if 
possible, is even more chilling than it sounds. A great many people have been 
arrested in Iraq and simply never heard from again. Others have been detained, 
only to have their bodies, and sometimes those of their family members, put on 
public display a few days later. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last case of a celebrated journalist being arrested, Farzad Bazoft, an 
Iranian-born reporter working for London's Observer newspaper, was accused of 
spying and swiftly executed after a five-hour, closed-door trial in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brought up largely in Britain, Farzad -- no more than the rest of us -- could 
have had little real idea of the gap between the acceptable face of Iraq, in 
the Foreign Ministry officials whom he knew, and the brutality of the security 
forces of the regime that lay behind," Adrian Hamilton, the Observer's deputy 
editor, said in a eulogy. 
</P>
<P>
 Neriman believes that Iraqi intelligence officials were upset about a story 
Haddad filed shortly before his arrest. The story focused on military exercises 
conducted in January northeast of Baghdad, the first to be held since the 
conclusion of the Gulf War. It was one of two articles officers seized when 
they searched the house. The second was about the economic situation in Iraq 
under the international embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the military story Haddad wrote -- which never got sent to Asahi -- was no 
different than what a British newspaper had published days earlier, she said. 
Details of the exercises were also published by Iraq's official news agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the course of the first few weeks, Neriman and Haddad's other family 
members visited police stations and government departments all over Iraq, 
inquiring about his whereabouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to meet so many officials, but it seems nobody cares to interfere 
with Iraqi intelligence," she said. "They told us not to go anywhere, not to 
ask about him, not to go somewhere to complain about the case -- to just leave 
it to them and he will come out sometime: in a week, in a month, nobody knows." 
</P>
<P>
 Now it has been months, and Neriman has decided to talk publicly for the first 
time -- a decision that could put her and her 22-month-old daughter, Niveen, in 
jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 Asahi Shimbun has lodged a formal inquiry and complaint with the Iraqi 
Ministry of Information and, through the Japanese Embassy, with the Ministry of 
Foreign Affairs. So far, there has been no reply. 
</P>
<P>
 But a newspaper spokesman said he had been told unofficially that the arrest 
had nothing to do with Haddad's work as a journalist. Some in Baghdad, he said, 
speculated that Haddad was suspected of illegally transferring his salary into 
overseas bank accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Neriman said her husband's high salary for Asahi, which she estimated at 
$5,000 a month, was much-discussed in sanctions-ridden Baghdad. "Some of his 
friends were always talking about Subhy being a multimillionaire. So these 
rumors have a great effect on the case. Nobody believes an Iraqi journalist 
gets such a salary," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent interview in Baghdad, Hamid Youssef Hammadi, Iraq's minister of 
information, was asked about Haddad's whereabouts. His face fell from a smile 
into a scowl. "I'm not responsible for that," he said curtly. Asked if he 
simply had information about his fate, Hammadi walked to the door and gestured 
for his guest to leave. "I have no information," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neriman had been Haddad's secretary at Asahi before the two fell in love and 
decided to marry. "He is very kind and very gentle and smart. Educated. 
Everything. . . . We were very much in love, and since we were married, we 
haven't been separated. This is the first time," Neriman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now she keeps pictures of her husband around the house and shows them often to 
Niveen, to remind her of what her father looks like. "Before she sleeps at 
night, she kisses his photos," she said. "She says, 'Papa will come.' "

ASIA; JAL ATTENDANTS' WAGES HIT TURBULENCE IN JAPAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Japan Air Lines' plan to start hiring contract flight attendants at half the 
pay of full-status employees has stirred a new controversy here over government 
intervention in private business. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle -- unusual only in that it has gone public -- is not over yet. 
</P>
<P>
 But signs are pointing to a victory for business. 
</P>
<P>
 It started in August, just as JAL was about to interview applicants for jobs 
as contract flight attendants. Transportation Minister Shizuka Kamei lashed out 
at JAL and its president, condemning them for ignoring concerns of safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Asserting that flight attendants earning only half as much as other crew 
members would not be able to unite in teamwork needed in case of an emergency, 
he ordered JAL to drop the plan. If it didn't, applications for additional 
flights would be rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Aware that JAL was acting as a Trojan horse for Japan's two other airlines, 
which also are operating in the red, Kamei made his threat applicable to any 
airline employing what he called "part-timers." 
</P>
<P>
 Part-time in Japanese usage means contract workers who work a full-time 
schedule. At JAL, they would differ from full-status employees only in their 
pay and in their one-year contracts, renewable for a maximum of three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting pay would be about $20,000 a year, compared to twice that for 
full-timers. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, 2,500 women applied for the first 100 part-time jobs -- apparently 
because of the glamour attached to flight attendant's work and an increasingly 
tough labor market, especially for women. 
</P>
<P>
 To JAL, which had already won approval of Transportation Ministry bureaucrats, 
Kamei's move came as a bolt of lightning. But JAL meekly announced that it 
would withdraw its plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Far from fading away, though, the dispute exploded into what the mass media 
here have dubbed the "turtle-crane war." The first character in Kamei's name 
means turtle ; the crane is JAL's corporate symbol. 
</P>
<P>
 Takeshi Nagano, president of Nikkeiren (Japan Federation of Employers Assns.), 
attacked Kamei for blatant interference in private business. Kamei, in turn, 
condemned Nagano for siding with the equivalent of 19th-Century robber barons 
who seek profit at the expense of all human considerations. 
</P>
<P>
 Mass media jumped on the furor, mostly siding with JAL. 
</P>
<P>
 The media consensus was that JAL wages are indeed too high, even when compared 
to other Japanese, who earn an average of about $55,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 JAL officials said annual income of an average 31-year-old employee amounts to 
$80,000 and claimed that sum is about double what U.S. airlines pay their cabin 
crew. 
</P>
<P>
 Susumu Makino, vice president of the independent Japan Air Lines Cabin 
Attendants Union, said wages are higher than average because cabin crew jobs 
involve specialized skills. But he said wages average only $66,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's problems come from managerial mishaps, not high wages, he 
insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur J. Alexander, of the Japan Economic Institute in Washington, agreed. In 
a Sept. 2 report issued by the Japanese government-supported institute, he 
called JAL "one of the most inefficient carriers" in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Makino's union strongly opposes JAL's part-timer scheme. But with only 1,600 
members, its voice is drowned out. The 13,000-member Zenro (All Japan Air Lines 
Labor Union), set up by JAL, isn't complaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "JAL is our workplace. In normal circumstances, we think full-time employees 
should be hired, but the company has suffered red ink for three straight years. 
We have been told that even our own jobs are becoming threatened," Zenro 
representative Hideo Kato said.

ASTRONAUTS TEST JET PACK IN UNTETHERED SPACEWALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two jet-propelled astronauts unhooked their lifelines from the space shuttle 
Discovery on Friday and flew free 150 miles above Earth in the first untethered 
spacewalks in 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Lee and Carl Meade had only one jet pack between them and took turns 
flying with the one-of-a-kind, $7-million unit. The jet pack is meant to be a 
life preserver for space station crews of the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "This thing works like a champ," Lee said as he hovered over Discovery's cargo 
bay, firing tiny jets to guide his way. 
</P>
<P>
 He was only the seventh person to fly free in space. Meade was No. 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The next step was even more dramatic: With a brilliant blue Earth as a 
backdrop, Lee and Meade stood at the end of Discovery's 50-foot mechanical arm. 
Meade, his feet secured to the crane, shoved Lee into a head-over-heels tumble 
of the sort a spacewalker might experience in an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 Meade apparently didn't realize his own strength, and Lee somersaulted again 
and again. Lee asked him to be more gentle. Meade obliged, and this time Lee 
did a slow-motion pirouette. 
</P>
<P>
 When it became Lee's turn, he joked: "There's no baseball going on, Carl, so I 
guess I'll have to catch you, huh?" 
</P>
<P>
 The trickiest exercise of the seven-hour spacewalk had each spacewalker propel 
himself along the length of the shuttle arm, which was bent at a sharp angle. 
They scooted from the shoulder to the elbow, around the bend, up to the end and 
then back down again -- never using their hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Until Friday, only six astronauts had walked in space without a lifeline to 
the mother ship, all in 1984. The first was NASA's Bruce McCandless. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the first six human satellites used NASA's massive manned maneuvering 
units, which were mothballed because of their size and expense. 
</P>
<P>
 The new jet pack, called SAFER -- for Simplified Aid for Extravehicular 
Activity Rescue -- weighs just 83 pounds on Earth but, like everything else, 
nothing in space. It is not nearly as thick or cumbersome as the old one. There 
are 24 tiny nitrogen gas jets, and the spacewalker guides himself with a 
joystick. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules for the spacewalk were simple: No flying more than 25 feet from 
Discovery and no speeding. And only one spacewalker untethered at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 The average speed of each jet-propelled spacewalker was just one-half foot per 
second, or a measly one-third m.p.h. The maximum speed of the jet pack is 7 
m.p.h.

<P>
 "Immediately after the war, there was . . . looting everywhere," Penninah 
Mbabazi explained. "People started running here and there, to other people's 
houses, picking things. The refrigerators were the first to be looted -- 
refrigerators, radios, cookers." 
</P>
<P>
 The 32-year-old woman knows what she's talking about: Mbabazi is now the 
"manager" of the Kigali Night Club, a one-story concrete blockhouse with a 
veranda bar overlooking Rwanda's capital. On Fridays and Saturdays, it attracts 
up to 1,000 people to guzzle beer and soft drinks. 
</P>
<P>
 And who is the owner? 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know, really," said the soft-spoken Mbabazi, with a shy smile. Less 
than three months ago, she still lived in Uganda with her daughter, 10, and 
son, 5. "The things we are owning now are not ours." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of Rwanda's genocide, civil war and takeover by the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front-dominated government, a New Deal of sorts is under way in this 
isolated, strife-weary Central African country. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the beneficiaries are members of the Tutsi ethnic minority who, like 
Mbabazi, lived until this summer in exile, in many cases for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The losers are Rwanda's hundreds of thousands of dead, and the armies of 
refugees from the dominant Hutu ethnic group who have fled into Zaire, 
Tanzania, Burundi and other countries, leaving their homes and most of their 
belongings behind. 
</P>
<P>
 To entice those wretched, often terrified people back, and to prove the claim 
that theirs is an African revolution with a difference, Rwanda's new rulers 
have insisted that the goodies that people such as Mbabazi have "picked" aren't 
really theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a traumatized and poor land whose capital still lacks even such basic 
services as street lights, electricity and running water, enforcement of that 
policy can only be sporadic at best. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter who a person is, he has a right to his house," President Pasteur 
Bizimungu told a recent rally in the southern town of Butare. And that, 
Bizimungu said, includes suspects in last April's massacres. 
</P>
<P>
 But from some Rwandans, who had fled into exile after an earlier anti-Tutsi 
uprising in 1959 killed an estimated 100,000 people, the new government is 
clearly expecting too much. A middle-aged man in sunglasses who returned to his 
homeland after 32 years told Bizimungu that he did not understand why he 
shouldn't occupy the once-empty house he now lives in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Am I supposed to spend my life leaving places with my mattress?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 And many more exiles are returning now, keen on finding places to live and 
occupations to keep them busy. According to the Office of the U.N. High 
Commissioner for Refugees, 100,000 Rwandans who had long lived in Uganda to the 
north have recently crossed the border with 130,000 head of livestock in hasty 
search of new homes and farms. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are now trying to work with the government to find land for them," said 
Janvier de Riedmatten, deputy representative of the U.N. agency in Rwanda. "If 
this problem is not tackled quickly, it could become a major issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. agency's efforts have been only partly successful, however. Fifty 
thousand of the returnees have stayed on the lands offered them, including 
tracts once reserved for hunting in Kagera National Park, De Riedmatten said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the former exiles, he said, are continuing south, eagerly 
scavenging for empty huts and shacks and abandoned pastures and fields. 
</P>
<P>
 And the land grab in Rwanda is clearly due to get bigger: The U.N. refugee 
office estimates that about 1 million Rwandans had been living in exile in 
surrounding countries when the old order collapsed this year in mass murder and 
civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 Across Africa, the possession of political power has often been synonymous 
with the opportunity to get rich. A 1973 coup by the then-minister of defense 
and future president, Juvenal Habyarimana, opened the way for his clan from 
Rwanda's northwest to line its pockets. Habyarimana was killed April 6 when his 
plane was shot down over Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
 When leaders of the defeated hard-line Hutu regime that succeeded Habyarimana 
fled across the border into Zaire, they took fleets of official and private 
vehicles, stocks of arms and a large chunk of the national treasury with them. 
People in the Rwandan Patriotic Front and their sympathizers apparently think: 
Now it's our turn. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is definitely our mother country, even if it has been bad to us," 
Mbabazi said as she sat at an unpainted wooden desk near the bar, puzzling over 
thick ledgers that also belong, or belonged, to the bar's vanished owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Her husband was a fighter with the Front's victorious army, but she hasn't 
seen him in months. She is not sure if he is alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Crisscrossing the country, Toyota pickup trucks can sometimes be seen carting 
young Front soldiers holding on to sofas or refrigerators. At the French 
Embassy, aghast security personnel estimate that the ransacking of the 
chancellery, ambassador's residence and cultural center after the staff fled 
last April will cost French taxpayers $20 million. 
</P>
<P>
 France had been one of the chief supporters of the old Habyarimana regime, and 
at the embassy people have no doubt that the pillage and gleeful vandalism were 
committed by Rwandan Patriotic Front soldiers or their civilian supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was their way of saying, 'Thank you,' " a police officer flown in from 
Toulouse to help get the mission running again said dryly. "They stole the 
cars. They trashed the computers. They thought they were television sets but 
couldn't make them work." 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, acts of indiscipline have taken place, but the leaders have said 
again and again they will be punished," said Canadian Maj. Jean-Guy Plante, 
spokesman for the U.N. peacekeeping mission here, in reference to the Rwandan 
Patriotic Front's forces. "Generally speaking, they have good discipline." 
</P>
<P>
 That appears to be changing as the victorious army, many of whose troops are 
penniless teen-agers or exiles, seek other occupations now that there is no 
longer an enemy to fight. U.N. officials said that soldiers manning checkpoints 
in Kigali have been shaking down traders or extorting money before merchants 
are allowed to even see their goods. In some locales, soldiers have reportedly 
engaged in cattle-rustling. 
</P>
<P>
 In the capital, according to one estimate, wholesale massacres and flight have 
halved the population to 300,000. That means a lot of empty dwellings and 
stores, and plenty of temptation. The city's new mayor, a Tutsi RPF major named 
Rose Kabue, is trying to juggle the conflicting requirements of the ban on 
property-grabbing and the pressing need to house returning exiles or Rwandans 
displaced from their own homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are allowing them to occupy whatever houses they can get on the 
understanding that when the owners show up, they will vacate them," Kabue said 
in a newspaper interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Time will tell what the Front's army and officials do with the buildings they 
have taken. The government's de facto headquarters is in what had been one of 
Kigali's swankiest hotels, the Meridien. In Kiyovu, the city's poshest quarter, 
young soldiers of the new regime stand guard outside elegant, shaded villas now 
occupied by their superiors. 
</P>
<P>
 The seeds for continued bitter social conflict are obvious, especially if the 
main winners of the Rwandan New Deal are perceived by Hutus to be the minority 
Tutsi, who from the 15th Century used feudal land ownership and a lord-peasant 
system to rule a Hutu community almost six times bigger than theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many Tutsis, Mbabazi fled Rwanda decades ago, in 1964, or two years after 
independence. She was then 2 years old and grew up in a refugee camp in Uganda. 
She returned to her homeland in a taxi in July for the first time, after the 
Front's soldiers had driven troops of the ousted government out of Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we came back, we were all anxious for something to do," she said. "We 
roamed about, looking for something, and came upon this empty building." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Tutsi returnee, Janes Mbabazi, who is not a relative, nominated 
herself as the club's "director." The stock had been looted, so the women spent 
some of the cash they had brought with them to buy cases of beer and Coca-Cola. 
They opened July 15 and have not gotten around to fixing a gaping slash in the 
corrugated roof cut by an exploding Katyusha rocket. But they did manage to 
find a generator to chill the Uganda-brewed Bell Brand lager they serve. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were so many generators lying around, so we picked one up," the Kigali 
Night Club's manager said. 
</P>
<P>
 Penninah Mbabazi and her children also moved into a three-bedroom house in 
Kigali that had been abandoned and looted. Unlike some other returnees, she was 
not able to grab an abandoned car. "I was unfortunate," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 If people who live in the Kimuhurura district are right, the two women who now 
run the Kigali Night Club do not have to worry about a property dispute anytime 
soon. The establishment, they say, was owned by the son of Habyarimana, the 
late president, a person who would hardly be welcomed back by the new people in 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "The things we are owning are not ours," Mbabazi said anyway. "If the owners 
come, they can take them. If there is any confusion, we can always negotiate." 
</P>
<P>
 On a nearby road, young boys picked over the carcasses of stolen and abandoned 
cars in search of something of value. Two handsome chestnut horses, a male and 
a female, ambled aimlessly up the steep hill, poking their noses into the grass 
at the roadside. Their owner had either been killed or fled. Now they too were 
there for the picking.

FAULTY LIGHT CAUSES SHORT IN WHITE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three firetrucks rushed to the White House on Friday to investigate a smell 
that turned out to be coming from a faulty light fixture near First Lady 
Hillary Rodham Clinton's West Wing office. There was no fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "A light fixture shorted out and there was a strong odor," White House Press 
Secretary Dee Dee Myers said. "Nothing has burned at all." 
</P>
<P>
 An aide to domestic policy adviser Carol Rasco contacted the Fire Department 
after smelling something outside her office, which is down the hall from the 
First Lady's. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything's fine, everything's under control, no one was evacuated," Myers 
said. "There was absolutely no threat, no danger of a fire." 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters were replacing the faulty fixture, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The President was meeting with foreign leaders in the residential quarters of 
the White House at the time, she said, but the meeting was not disrupted.

BRITAIN ENDS BROADCAST BAN ON IRISH EXTREMISTS; NEGOTIATIONS: PRIME MINISTER 
MAJOR ALSO BACKS REFERENDUM ON NORTHERN IRELAND'S FATE. BOTH MOVES INDICATE 
DESIRE TO MOVE AHEAD ON PEACE PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prime Minister John Major ended a much-ridiculed ban on broadcasting the 
voices of extremist leaders in Northern Ireland on Friday and declared his 
support for a referendum of Catholics and Protestants to determine their 
political fate. 
</P>
<P>
 Major's comments, during a visit to Belfast, constituted his strongest signal 
yet that he is prepared to make progress on negotiations among the contending 
Protestant and Catholic forces in the deadly 25-year-old Northern Ireland 
conflict even though he has not received an explicit guarantee that a recently 
declared Irish Republican Army cease-fire is permanent. 
</P>
<P>
 The government also further reduced security measures in Northern Ireland, 
agreeing to open a number of roads connecting the British-ruled province with 
the independent Republic of Ireland. British security forces had erected 
concrete barricades along hundreds of the rural roads in an effort to deny easy 
cross-border movement to terrorists and their materiel. 
</P>
<P>
 The lifting of the broadcast ban appeared primarily intended to encourage more 
peace overtures from Catholic republicans, while the vow of support for a 
referendum was an attempt to allay the fears of Protestant unionists. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban on broadcasting the voices of both Catholic and Protestant 
paramilitaries has been the source of much derision and mostly affects Gerry 
Adams, leader of the outlawed IRA's legal political wing, Sinn Fein. While 
Adams' face is regularly seen on British television, his voice is dubbed by an 
actor who merely repeats Adams' words, sometimes in less than perfect 
synchronization. 
</P>
<P>
 "The broadcasting restrictions were brought in to stop supporters of terrorist 
organizations from using television and radio to justify violence," Major said. 
"I believe the restrictions are no longer serving the purpose for which they 
were intended. . . . Ways have been found to circumvent them. But most 
importantly, we are now in very different circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 The IRA, the group battling for unification of Northern Ireland with 
predominantly Catholic Ireland, declared a cease-fire Aug. 31 in response to 
proposals for peace talks jointly sponsored by the governments in London and 
Dublin. Major has said he would be ready to begin talks only when the IRA or 
Sinn Fein states unequivocally that the days of guns and bombs are gone 
forever. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither has done so publicly, though the IRA has not committed any act of 
terrorism since its declaration. The same is not true of its extremist 
Protestant counterparts, who have staged several bombings since Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 The promise of a referendum on any settlement reached around the negotiating 
table was meant to reassure Protestants that they will not be separated from 
Britain against their will, according to many observers. 
</P>
<P>
 Since they are now a majority in Northern Ireland, the Protestants could 
presumably block the outcome the nationalists say they are still seeking: 
unification with Ireland. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Protestants say they believe that a "secret deal" exists between Dublin 
and London that will force them into what they consider an odious fate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me say to all the people of Northern Ireland," Major said, "the 
referendum means that it will be your choice whether to accept the outcome" of 
any negotiations.  
</P>
<P>
 The opening of the border roads was a significant concession to Catholic 
nationalists, many of whom believe that free movement across the borders means 
a de facto unification with Ireland, if not constitutional merger. 
</P>
<P>
 Activists have been playing a cat-and-mouse game with British security forces 
for several weeks, bulldozing border blockades by day only to have them 
replaced by the British overnight.

MEXICANS LOOK HARD TO SEE HOPE; LATIN AMERICA: ELECTION PROMISES MAY PROVE 
EMPTY FOR RESIDENTS OF SLUMS NEAR THE CAPITAL. THEY NOW FACE EVICTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FINEMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As she stood proudly on the rupturing fringes of the second-most populous city 
on the globe, in the mud of a shantytown that is only a dirt mine on maps, it 
was hard for Alejandra Sanchez to look with hope to the future -- her future, 
Mexico's future, the bold, new future the next president has vowed to bring. 
</P>
<P>
 The present, she said just a week after Mexico's historic presidential 
election, is hard enough. And her view was from "the promised land" -- one of 
scores of slums that have drawn millions of impoverished rural Mexicans to the 
teeming edge of the capital, Mexico City, in search of jobs and a new life. 
</P>
<P>
 Hers was, in fact, a view of post-election Mexico through the prism of the 
poverty shared by hundreds of thousands of families who voted as one in many of 
these slums. They voted for Mexico's long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary 
Party, or PRI, for its President-elect Ernesto Zedillo and for his promises of 
a new era of democracy, reform and prosperity for the nation's estimated 40 
million poor. 
</P>
<P>
 In this tiny barrio called St. Geronimo of the Four Winds, Sanchez and about 
200 other families -- every one of them self-professed lifelong supporters of 
Zedillo's ruling party -- are about to be evicted from their land, tiny plots 
they bought from a professional swindler who is now behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're trying to evict us, and already we're suffering here," Sanchez said. 
In the six years since her family paid 4,500 pesos (about $1,500) to a local 
ward boss for a small plot of land, they have received no electricity, no 
water, no schools, no clinics and no legal title to that land. And now, a 
company that mines dirt nearby for construction projects in the burgeoning 
capital claims to be the rightful owner of the land. 
</P>
<P>
 As she spoke, the 31-year-old mother of six cradled her youngest child, 
10-month-old Sarah, while the older ones, all girls, played nearby, some using 
the skeleton of a forgotten Dodge as a jungle gym and others using a tree rope 
as a swing. Her husband, Santiago, wasn't around, she said. He was out looking 
for work -- a daily search for a day job in construction, the growth industry 
in a city long since grown out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at the way we are living," she said. "What kind of future can we hope 
for for our children? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "For the future, I wish only that we have the basic services of life, and that 
they don't evict us from this land. If they throw me out, where will I take my 
daughters?" 
</P>
<P>
 But then she smiled, offering up her first real look of hope. "We'll go to the 
United States," she said, "if, of course, they'll take us." 
</P>
<P>
 It is, it seems, the bitterest of ironies that after an election billed as a 
watershed of democratic change, the end of a migration trail for so many 
millions would be merely the beginning of another. 
</P>
<P>
 And such are the bitter realities of these slums, the "lost cities" of the 
Mexican capital, that old pueblos such as Chalco, long ago swallowed up by the 
sprawl of a city now numbering more than 20 million, would become increasingly 
fertile ground for that migration. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say the United States has a vital interest in the present and future 
of the lost cities and their residents' view of Mexican democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Election Day, most of the people in the lost cities didn't want to talk 
about politics. All they wanted to know was how long the flight is from Mexico 
City to Los Angeles," said Douglas Payne, an expert on Mexico with the 
Washington-based Freedom House who spent eight days in Chalco before and during 
Mexico's Aug. 21 national elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "They weren't so worried about themselves. They just want to see to that their 
kids can get to the U.S. . . . It's the most porous border between the First 
and Third World anywhere in the world, and the lure is constant, magnetic. The 
only real solution is to improve their situation in Mexico, physically and 
politically, or the flow will only continue to grow." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican government under President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has tried to 
do just that -- and nowhere with more public resources than it has devoted to 
Chalco. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's ambitious social welfare campaign, known as the National 
Solidarity Program, began in Chalco in 1990. In the four years since Salinas, 
who visited Chalco's squalor during his 1988 presidential campaign, chose this 
slum as a model for development, the government has pumped more than $300 
million worth of roads, clinics, drinking water, electricity and other services 
into the 5,189 acres officially designated as the Chalco Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Those efforts did improve the quality of life in much of Chalco, which is now 
home to more than half a million on the eastern fringe of Mexico City. But it 
was double-edged development. 
</P>
<P>
 It acted as a magnet for tens of thousands more migrants from the impoverished 
countryside. It exposed them to American television and an array of 
out-of-reach consumer goods. It planted the seeds of another dream that Payne 
labels simply "looking North." And it so far has failed to change a grass-roots 
system of corruption, fraud and frustration that many residents say is 
synonymous with local elements of the ruling party. 
</P>
<P>
 Another veteran Chalco analyst, reporter Juan Lazaro of the Mexico City daily 
El Universal, summed up his own post-election impression of what has been his 
beat for the last four years: 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chalco Valley, the promised land, the land of misery and hope, where the 
federal government's National Solidarity Program invested more than 1 billion 
pesos to improve the quality of life of about 500,000 residents in extreme 
poverty, now wants only to be free." 
</P>
<P>
 During a tour of Chalco's mud-and-swamp barrios , many of them in legal limbo 
after corrupt land deals like the ones that victimized St. Geronimo of the Four 
Winds, Lazaro had little to add, letting the landscape speak for itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The visit included a stop at a primary school reachable only by truck, 
four-wheel-drive or the sturdiest automobile. Late last month, the school was 
filled not just with children but with men, women and families who spoke 
volumes about the system that analysts such as Payne say must change in the 
slums if they are to become an end, rather than a means, of Mexican migration. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no classes in the Ruben Jaramillo Primary School, a new concrete 
structure built two years ago under the Solidarity program along with scores of 
schools, streets and basketball courts throughout Chalco. 
</P>
<P>
 And there won't be any unless the government finds a new home for the 420 
families living in and around it, huddling under leaky tarpaulins and scrap tin 
that was all they could carry when they were evicted from their shanties on the 
eve of the Aug. 21 elections. 
</P>
<P>
 As they told their story -- they too had bought from a swindler who is now in 
jail -- it was clear that these people had much in common with Alejandra 
Sanchez and the families of St. Geronimo of the Four Winds. Their nightmare 
simply had progressed to the next stage. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were differences. For one thing, they said, they refused to promise 
their votes to Zedillo and the ruling PRI when local ward bosses offered their 
help in exchange for their votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "First the police came and said they would kick us out in a week. They said, 
'This land is not negotiable.' But we said we paid for this land," said Teresa 
de Jesus Perez Vasquez, 30, who was living under a small orange tarp behind the 
school with her five children, her unemployed husband, another family of seven 
and the last of their worldly goods. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then the PRI people came and said they had a way for us to stay there. If we 
voted for them, they said they would get us our land. But when we said we 
weren't going to support one party or the other, that we were only looking to 
keep a small piece of land, they abandoned us. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were frightened from the harassment and threats (that followed). We 
couldn't go out of our homes late in the day or at night." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, true to their word, the police came on Election Day, according to 
Vasquez and dozens of her neighbors. More than 400 municipal riot police, they 
said, destroyed their shanties and stole many of their possessions. Only after 
a non-governmental, civic-action group intervened through the school's 
director, Ignacio Martinez Romero, did the families move into the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez confirmed that his civic-action group, the Popular Revolutionary 
Union of Emiliano Zapata, has filed a formal protest with the Federal Electoral 
Tribunal alleging that the ruling party used intimidation to attempt to force 
the families now living in his school to cast ballots for the PRI. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez also said his group confirmed that most of the 420 families had 
indeed purchased their land, but without legal title, in what he called a 
typical, wide-ranging land fraud that is still under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, this is not an unusual situation. It's happening all over the 
lost cities," the school director said, standing in the schoolyard amid cooking 
fires and refugee tents. One wall bears the portraits of Mexican revolutionary 
leader Emiliano Zapata and Cuban revolutionary Che Guevara. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything here is (about) land. The city has swallowed Chalco, and now 
Chalco is swallowing itself. And fraud is the system. At this level, fraud and 
politics seem to go together." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez only smiled when asked what he thinks the next six years will hold. 
"I don't even know where I'm going to hold classes," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing nearby, beside her makeshift tent, Teresa de Jesus Perez Vasquez was 
even more uncertain. Like millions of other rural Mexicans, she said, she came 
alone from the poverty of her home state of Oaxaca to the capital at age 12, 
searching for work. She found a husband, married and started a family. Now, she 
said, there is no question of going back. 
</P>
<P>
 The land in Oaxaca is bad and the poverty even worse, she and others in the 
group said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're near work here," she said. "And to move would be too radical a change 
for the family. That's why we're continuing here in our fight to obtain a piece 
of land." 
</P>
<P>
 With the new government, she was asked, will things improve? 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are going to just go on the way they are," she said. "We don't have 
anyplace else to go." 
</P>
<P>
 But there was another voice among the 420 families, an elder of the group who 
spoke more freely of a deeper anger and a far-off hope for the future. Juan 
Aguilar Rodriguez, 60, who said he hauls carrots to the municipal depot and 
must buy a license from local ruling party officials to do it, said he harbors 
little hope for change from within. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, the PRI is the biggest mafia in the country. Imagine, I have to pay a 
tax just to have the right to work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government doesn't even let us work. They want everything for themselves. 
They cut the slices of cheese to trade among themselves. They never let the 
people in on it. They know all the laws. They're always citing the legal codes. 
But for them, the constitution is like an accordion. They play it the way they 
want it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, I don't know how to read. I can't write," he continued. "It's the 
hardest thing in the world for me to try to find work. And at my age, at 60 
years old, can you imagine? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want presents. I don't want charity. I just want to work." 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps not here. Pondering the future, Aguilar stopped speaking, smiled 
and pointed at his T-shirt, which bore a silver-and-black football helmet and 
the words "Los Angeles Raiders."

STUDENTS SEE SOME GOOD, SOME BAD IN NEW COURSE

 Student reaction Friday to Chancellor Laurel L. Wilkening's plan to catapult 
UC Irvine into the ranks of the nation's top 50 research universities ranged 
from guarded approval to apathy to fears about a decline in UCI's teaching 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
 With the fall quarter less than two weeks away and the campus largely quiet, 
news of the chancellor's vision for the estimated 13,000 undergraduates and 
3,000 graduates spread slowly. Most students received word of the chancellor's 
plan from an eight-page campus newspaper in which Wilkening outlined her ideas 
to bolster university research while coping with state funding cuts to UCI of 
$35 million since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Undergraduate and graduate student leaders, who convened separately to discuss 
the chancellor's plan, seemed supportive of its ideals but questioned its 
specifics and implementation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do see a lot of her long-term vision and that's good," said Bryan Hannegan, 
24, of Irvine, a doctoral candidate in mechanical engineering and a vice 
president of a graduate student government. "But from a student perspective, 
we'd like to know what is going to happen in the short term." 
</P>
<P>
 Added undergraduate vice president and social ecology major Michelle Tsui: 
"It's looking pretty good now. We will be looking to see how the student 
community will respond and how (the plan) will be implemented." 
</P>
<P>
 But other students whose department fell victim to the university streamlining 
expressed disappointment with the chancellor's choices. Students in the 
comparative culture program, the university's only academic casualty thus far, 
were particularly upset. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The program) offered a unique perspective beyond the dominant culture," said 
Jaime Ruiz, 23, of Carson, who is a double major in history and comparative 
culture. "It was the only anti-Establishment program. I found it more 
intellectually stimulating . . . than other courses which espouse middle-class 
values." 
</P>
<P>
 Many students in humanities courses also feared that the chancellor's plan 
signals a further trend toward what they described as the overvaluing of 
research and undervaluing of undergraduate teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "The emphasis on this cut-and-dried research rather than teachers that have 
actually helped students is completely detrimental to the university," said 
Michael Allen, 23, a senior history major from Cerritos. "I'd look at other 
schools if I had it to do over again." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think students feel research is more important than undergraduates," added 
Desiree Hedberg, editor of the New University. 
</P>
<P>
 Hedberg said the student newspaper will comment on the chancellor's plan point 
by point in an issue due out Monday. Eliminating the comparative cultures 
department is a blow to undergraduates, Hedberg said, but at least the 
chancellor's statement seemed to consider their concerns about teaching 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often, we've felt pretty ignored" by the administration, said Hedberg, 21, a 
senior English major from the San Francisco Bay area. 
</P>
<P>
 Other students shrugged off Wilkening's announcement. Bryan Allred, who 
received his undergraduate degree from UCI and is now a graduate student in 
civil engineering, seemed unfazed by the chancellor's plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been so many changes and cutbacks that after a while I think you 
become oblivious," said the 23-year-old from Irvine.

FACULTY NOT SURPRISED BY PLAN; PROFESSORS: SOME WORRY WHAT CLOSURE OF 
COMPARATIVE CULTURE PROGRAM MEANS FOR ETHNIC STUDIES IN GENERAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 Faculty members expressed little surprise Friday in reaction to UC Irvine 
Chancellor Laurel L. Wilkening's outline for the future of the university, with 
many saying she has taken a conservative first step on the road to change. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think this particular announcement will make major changes in student 
life," said Prof. Juan Bruce-Novoa, head of the Spanish and Portuguese 
department. "The election of the governor will probably have more effect on 
student life than what has happened here." 
</P>
<P>
 While some faculty members said they believe a major restructuring of 
university operations is needed, Wilkening rejected calls for further cuts in 
the number of vice chancellors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a thoughtful, well-balanced scientific statement, and yet I think it 
was quite cautious," said Alan Hoffer, whose education department was spared 
from earlier recommendations for elimination by a faculty task force. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most contentious faculty issues concern the tiny ethnic studies 
programs that are struggling for recognition among UCI's major academic 
departments. The four programs were granted autonomy in selecting faculty 
members, but they will also be required to operate within established academic 
departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert Gonzalez, a professor of comparative culture whose program has been 
earmarked for elimination, said the ethnic studies programs should be grouped 
together as an independent academic department. 
</P>
<P>
 "What she's really saying is that there's no academic discipline of ethnic 
studies," Gonzales said. "It seems to have been placed on the margins by some 
of the bigger players on campus." 
</P>
<P>
 R. Bin Wong, director of Asian American studies, shares Gonzalez' concerns, 
but also believes the new ability of his program to hire faculty without the 
permission of a larger academic department is important. 
</P>
<P>
 "It represents, in some sense, a recognition that these programs are not 
simply an unwanted stepchild," Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkening's report comes on the heels of previous recommendations made by two 
faculty committees earlier this year. Some of the more controversial 
recommendations made by an academic task force were reversed by a second 
faculty committee, the Academic Planning Council. Wilkening emphasized on 
Friday that the hard sciences will play a dominant role in bringing badly 
needed research funds to the university. 
</P>
<P>
 But English professor John Carlos Rowe, director of African American studies, 
worries that the inability of humanities courses to attract large research 
grants has caused them to be neglected. Rowe recently received a $106,000 grant 
from the National Endowment for the Humanities for a multicultural education 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has high expectations for the way in which the hard sciences are going to 
work with industry," Rowe said. "The issue for humanists is that we don't have 
something we can sell. What we're really good at is improving the product of 
well-rounded citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 While generally praising Wilkening's proposals, Rowe is critical of the 
chancellor's support for additional hiring of part-time faculty members to help 
lighten faculty workloads. Rowe said the move is similar to trends in private 
industry, where part-time workers are replacing full-time workers who receive 
full benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid there is some justice in that analogy," Rowe said. "If I don't see 
a long-term career at the University of California, I'm going to (just) teach 
my classes and go home, which is what has happened at many institutions across 
the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Most faculty members contacted believe real structural change at UCI will be 
inevitable in order to cope with the bleak outlook for state education funding. 
And they see Wilkening's proposals as a only a tentative beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The statement she released is somewhat of an interim statement," Hoffer said. 
"There's a lot coming, because we have a lot of questions as to whether there 
should be a complete restructuring of departments."

NEWS ANALYSIS; TOO AMBITIOUS, OR NOT ENOUGH? EXPERTS VARY; CRITICISM: A GOAL OF 
MOVING THE SCHOOL FROM THE TOP 80 TO THE TOP 50 RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS IS 
GREETED WITH BOTH APPLAUSE AND SKEPTICISM BY EDUCATION INSIDERS.

<P>
 After months of discussion, anxiety and anticipation, the moment finally 
arrived Friday for those awaiting a statement from UC Irvine Chancellor Laurel 
L. Wilkening about her vision for the still-young university. 
</P>
<P>
 But those expecting a bombshell from the chancellor were likely to have been 
disappointed. Even Wilkening said her long-awaited statement, contained in a 
campus newspaper released to the university community, was in the end neither 
radical nor revolutionary. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, one criticism of her plan to push the 29-year-old school into the 
ranks of the top 50 research universities nationwide by the year 2000 might 
simply be that "this is what UCI is supposed to be doing," she said -- that, in 
essence, the plan, released after so much ferment on campus, might strike some 
as not dramatic enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Wilkening's articulation of her goals for the university -- 
specifically her aim of propelling it from the top 80 to the top 50 research 
institutions nationwide within a six-year period -- was greeted with both 
applause and skepticism by higher education experts outside the university and 
faculty and staff members within it. 
</P>
<P>
 "This kind of progress usually occurs over a period of decades and any 
realistic board or administration ought to be focusing on a little longer 
period of time," said Cornelius Pings, president of the Assn. of American 
Universities. 
</P>
<P>
 To achieve her goal in a time of economic crisis for universities throughout 
the state, UCI must attract increased funding from outside sources, 
particularly federal grants and private institutions, Wilkening said. She 
recommended cutting only one academic unit, the program in comparative culture, 
despite earlier recommendations from university committees that other 
departments also be discontinued. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those interviewed lauded the chancellor's decision to set such a 
specific target, even as they -- and she -- acknowledged that there was an 
element of risk involved in the possibility of failing to meet it by the 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't very often see explicit targets like that, at least not publicly 
announced," said David Merkowitz, a spokesman for the American Council on 
Education in Washington D.C. "But sometimes it can galvanize an institution." 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is ambitious, but achievable, said Wilkening, who noted that she 
opted not to strive for membership in the top 30, but chose a goal she 
considered realistic. 
</P>
<P>
 She listed several universities now ranked higher than UCI in such areas as 
the numbers of Ph.D.s they produce and their expenditures on research and 
development. These included state universities in Indiana, Utah, Nebraska and 
Missouri, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think these are institutions we have reasons to pass up," she said. Not 
only are they older universities with the baggage of programs that may be out 
of step with current research funding, their locations are not as pleasant as 
UCI's, she said. "Our location in Orange County is a great benefit to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkening pointed to a technology conference held Friday morning at UCI as an 
example of the university's outreach to private businesses in the Southern 
California area. The conference, organized by the Life Science Industry 
Council, a cooperative effort of the university and local biomedical companies, 
was meant to introduce about 40 of UCI's premiere researchers to local business 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're raising the priority of the highest-quality research," said Dr. Michael 
E. Selsted, a UCI pathology professor and top researcher at the conference. 
"One of the reasons to do that, for the purpose of our students, is that the 
successful research university attracts community support. We're going to have 
to become more dependent on community support. 
</P>
<P>
 "Orange County's been waiting for UCI to declare itself a first-class 
university. Everyone wants to be associated with a winner. And there's no 
question we can be." 
</P>
<P>
 But others were less laudatory, with one senior faculty member calling the 
attempt to push UCI into the top 50 research universities "a pretty weak goal, 
frankly." 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been in and out of the top 50 for the last 15 years," the professor 
said. "My view is that she should have said we should move into the top 25 and 
then be disappointed if we didn't get into the top 35. That would have been a 
lot more inspirational." 
</P>
<P>
 But even the stated goal is too ambitious, in the view of others. 
</P>
<P>
 Pings, whose elite, membership organization includes 59 of the nation's top 
research universities, said it is unrealistic to expect UCI to progress so far 
so fast. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is a realistic objective and could be attained over the passage 
of time and probably will be, but not in 63 months," said Pings, the former 
provost of USC. That said, however, he described UCI as a "very good, major 
research university right now" but one that is not yet a member of his 
organization. Among the other University of California campuses, only UCLA, UC 
Berkeley and UC San Diego are included. 
</P>
<P>
 In both the document and her comments, Wilkening highlighted specific areas 
that the university should expand and emphasize in its effort to garner 
increased federal and private funding. These include the biomedical and health 
sciences, information and computer services and education -- the latter a 
department that one panel last spring had recommended for closure. 
</P>
<P>
 Several of those interviewed praised the chancellor's areas of emphasis, 
saying they represented logical and in some cases, prescient, choices. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Topor, a consultant in marketing and strategic planning to universities 
and colleges, said he was particularly impressed with Wilkening's decision not 
only to retain the education department but to try to turn it into a source of 
increased funding and emphasis for the university. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that education generally is going to be the next significant item 
for our national government, after healthcare," Topor said. "That's a very 
significant move and a very smart one. Generally, the areas she has chosen to 
emphasize reflect some very careful thinking."

CIVILIANS CAPTURE LEADER OF FAILED COUP

<TEXT>
<P>
 Civilians Friday captured, beat and stripped the leader of a failed coup 
disguised as an Arab and handed him over to African intervention troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Former armed forces chief Charles Julue led about 100 disgruntled soldiers who 
briefly seized the West African country's seat of power Thursday. They were 
forced out by a massive assault by an African intervention force. 
</P>

 Battles between two other militias in the southeast sent refugees across the 
Cavally River into Ivory Coast, where 2,000 arrived in Tabou in 24 hours and 
thousands more awaited canoes to bring them over, a relief worker said.

IN BOLD STRATEGY, BROWN ASSAILS WILSON ON CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL M. WEINTRAUB, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has prospered politically through the years by painting his 
opponents as weak-kneed wimps who are soft on crime and criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the Republican chief executive, locked in a close fight for 
reelection, has found himself the victim of just the kind of accusation he has 
made an art of leveling. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's Democratic opponent -- state Treasurer Kathleen Brown -- is using 
Wilson's parole policy as the centerpiece of a bold political strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown is trying to make the case that a governor who built his career as a 
no-nonsense leader in the fight against crime is all talk and no walk, a phony 
who postures with the best of them but fails when it comes to taking action to 
make the streets safer. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopscotching the state, Brown has appeared with crime victims' relatives at 
several sites where parolees killed people whose deaths, she argues, the Wilson 
Administration could and should have prevented. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's tactics bring back memories of Willie Horton, the Massachusetts 
murderer who raped a woman while on a weekend furlough granted by then-Gov. 
Michael Dukakis. Supporters of Republican George Bush used Horton's image 
during the 1988 presidential campaign to portray Dukakis as hopelessly out of 
touch with the American people's concerns about crime. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pete Wilson is no Michael Dukakis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Massachusetts Democrat, after all, was a member of the American Civil 
Liberties Union and a supporter of alternatives to prison for certain 
criminals. He personally approved the order that allowed Horton to get out for 
his furlough. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, by contrast, since 1982 has helped qualify two pro-prosecution 
initiatives for the state ballot, supported the ouster of former state Supreme 
Court Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird, and, as governor, appointed judges who 
tend to be skeptical of defendants' courthouse claims. Wilson is the patron 
saint of a loose-knit coalition of victims rights groups, whose leaders have 
been known to weep while praising his dedication to their cause. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown has no record of her own on the crime issue other than the 
pronouncements and proposals she has put forth during her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 At one level, Brown is trying to undercut Wilson's drumbeat of criticism about 
her personal opposition to the death penalty. The governor is an ardent 
supporter of capital punishment who oversaw the first California execution in a 
quarter century. He revels in the fact that he and 80% of the state's voters 
share the view that killers ought to be put to death. Brown has said she would 
implement the death penalty law even though she opposes it. 
</P>
<P>
 But beyond that, Brown's tactics on parole and crime fit into a broader 
strategy through which she seeks to contrast Wilson's words with his deeds. 
</P>
<P>
 On taxes, on schools, the environment, Brown says, the incumbent has promised 
one thing and delivered another. The parole issue is a perfect example, she 
says, because he has talked about longer sentences for criminals while 
implementing a policy that let more of them stay on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have the worst of both worlds," Brown said in an interview. "Tough talk 
and weak action." 
</P>
<P>
 Paraphrasing Ronald Reagan, Brown asks voters, "Do you feel safer today than 
you did four years ago?" She knows that the answer, for most, will be no, 
despite Wilson's harsh rhetoric on criminals. And she hopes that will make them 
more skeptical of his many other claims as the campaign heads toward November. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's Administration has scrambled to respond to Brown's every charge, 
publishing reams of fact sheets, arranging briefings for reporters and sending 
out surrogates from law enforcement to counter her claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the governor's advisers insist they are delighted every time Brown brings 
up the subject because it gives Wilson and his troops another opportunity to 
remind voters of Wilson's record and Brown's lack of one. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Schnur, Wilson's campaign spokesman, says it's as if Bill Clinton, rather 
than focusing on the economy in his campaign against George Bush, had 
repeatedly tried to remind voters of the nation's victory in the war with Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more time she spends talking about crime or any aspect of the crime 
issue, the more she increases the saliency of an issue that cuts very favorably 
for us," Schnur said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's tactics also risk alienating liberals and policy experts who have 
wondered aloud whether her pronouncements are genuine or simply political 
posturing. Some find it difficult to believe that she is staking out positions 
so different from those once espoused by her more liberal father and brother, 
each of whom served two terms as governor. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman John Vasconcellos, the liberal Democratic chairman of the Ways and 
Means Committee, said he has been disappointed with Brown's tactics on parole. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find that to be just painful to hear that coming from people on my side," 
Vasconcellos said. "Drug rehabilitation and job training are in the long run 
beneficial for people to become able to lead constructive lives rather than 
dangerous ones. When people criticize folks for trying that, they make the 
whole thing much harder."

SLAYINGS SHOCK TOWN DEVOTED TO TRAVELERS; CRIME: MISSOURI HAMLET'S FIRST 
MURDERS PROMPT RESIDENTS TO BE WARY OF 'INTERSTATE PEOPLE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 The skyline of this country junction is familiar to anyone who has driven 
America's interstates. 
</P>
<P>
 Aloft, on 60-foot pylons, are the franchise logos. Scanning lower, plastic 
flags of every color flap in the muggy breeze. At ground level are the gas 
pumps, fast-food restaurants and chain motels. Big rigs lumber past rows of 
parked cars with plates from half a dozen states. 
</P>
<P>
 Like so many of the nation's pit-stop towns, the setting seems benign, if less 
than scenic. 
</P>
<P>
 But catering to drifters and pilgrims can be a deadly business, as Kingdom 
City has discovered in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 By gruesome coincidence, police say, two separate groups of cross-country 
serial killers exited Interstate 70 here last month to pillage and to slay. In 
each case, the murder victims were apparently Good Samaritans who offered help 
to stranded men with car trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 A Kansas City threesome -- two of whom are still at large and believed to be 
in the western United States -- allegedly began their spree with the abduction 
of a telephone company supervisor here late last month. Eight days later, 
authorities allege, another pair who had started their rampage in Ohio shot to 
death an elderly couple in their farmhouse less than three miles from I-70 -- 
and then went on to kill again in Oklahoma before their arrest in Santa Fe, 
N.M. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we really are the crossroads of America," Darlene Bergerson said 
wryly, eyebrows raised, in the souvenir emporium she manages. "We've been 
saying it long enough." 
</P>
<P>
 For a town with a population of 112 and no reported homicides in recent 
memory, the notion that their lifeline can bring death is a shock. In the wake 
of the killings, the workers and the local residents are re-evaluating their 
relationship with what they call "the interstate people." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 24,000 vehicles pass through every day, on their way to Lake of the 
Ozarks, St. Louis, Kansas City, points east and west and south. Kingdom City 
owes its running water, and soon a sewer system, to the wayfarers, who pay a 
1-cent village sales tax on every dollar's worth of purchases. 
</P>
<P>
 But now Dale Bolton has loaded his .38 special and his .22 revolver and placed 
them in a night stand drawer next to his bed. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife used the deadbolt for the first time ever on the night of the double 
murder. He was locked out when he returned at midnight from his job driving a 
forklift at a nearby brickyard. "I didn't have a key," he said, "and I had a 
hard time waking her up." 
</P>
<P>
 The town will install new lights in the darker sections. And there is talk of 
starting a police force, or hiring someone else's, like the Callaway County 
Sheriff's Department, to patrol regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it caught everybody off guard," said T.J. Atkinson, who owns the 
Gasper-Atkinson restaurant and truck stop here. "It happens every day in other 
places. Now we realize the people from those other places are coming here." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say the first set of marauders, whom they identify as Dennis 
Skillicorn, 34, and Allen Nicklasson, 22, hit town on Aug. 24. The two men met 
in a Kansas City drug rehab program. Along with a 17-year-old from the suburbs, 
they set out, friends later told police, to "make a name" for themselves. The 
teen-ager was driving the family car, an aging tan Caprice. 
</P>
<P>
 The vehicle broke down at least three times in Kingdom City. Once, mechanic 
Roger Redmon fixed the thermostat and was paid $43 in coins counted out from a 
Ritz cracker box (the trio is suspected of taking the money and three guns from 
a local residence). Later, a witness told police, the three got into a car 
driven by Richard Drummond, an AT&T supervisor who frequently stayed at the 
local Days Inn while on business. 
</P>
<P>
 Drummond's 1994 Dodge Intrepid was found three days later in Kingman, Ariz., 
near the corpses of a married couple, each shot in the head. His body was 
discovered in Lafayette County, about a two-hour drive west of Kingdom City, on 
Sept. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, authorities here had found a 1980 red Buick Skylark belonging to a 
woman in Port Washington, Ohio, feared murdered by Lewis Gilbert II, 22, and 
Eric Elliott, 16. The car had been stuck in a ditch. 
</P>
<P>
 Then relatives of William and Flossie Brewer found their bodies in their 
basement nearby. The husband was 86; the wife, 74. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert and Elliott were later arrested in Sante Fe. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, rural Callaway County's main claim to fame had been Fulton, seven 
miles south on Highway 54. The county seat, population 10,000, is the home of 
Westminster College, where Winston Churchill delivered his famous "Iron 
Curtain" speech in 1946. 
</P>
<P>
 Kingdom City was named for a much earlier episode. During the Civil War, the 
county seceded from both the Confederacy and the Union, declaring itself the 
"Kingdom of Callaway" in a largely successful effort to stay out of the 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 The town was incorporated just 15 years ago, to take advantage of the boom in 
traffic on I-70, which had been built in 1960. Kingdom City encompassed the new 
development burgeoning by the interchange and what had been a small settlement 
called McCredie. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, travelers' needs have taken precedence. There are three motels and 
two truck stops, but no library, no movie theater, no grocery store. 
</P>
<P>
 "We old folks all liked it better when it was McCredie," sighed Iva Dean Reed, 
63. The worst crime she can remember before incorporation was the time her 
mother left some pies to cool on the back porch and later noticed one slice 
missing. "They didn't take anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Her twin sister, Jean Bolton -- Dale's wife -- mourns the lost past too. "We 
moved out here because it's nice and quiet," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 By and large she still feels safe as she goes about her routine, harvesting 
tomatoes, pumpkins and enormous yams from the acre of land where her mobile 
home sits. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet she worries that the murders are a portent of the future. "It's changing 
times," she said. "The interstate's helping us catch up." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Nancy Lewis, director of the Callaway County Chamber of Commerce, 
several families near the expressway have put their houses up for sale, 
prompted by fear of more mayhem. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Redmon hasn't yet, but his wife and four daughters have made it known 
they'd like to leave the corrugated-metal residence attached to his garage and 
towing business. After all, he actually repaired a car for the Kansas City 
group accused of the first murder. 
</P>
<P>
 When he realized who his customers had been, he wondered why it took so long 
for something like this to happen. "Every day's a weird day," he said. "There's 
drugs all up and down this interstate every day. I've seen the interstate 
people working the churches, putting a kid up front. They say 'he's hungry, can 
we have $5.' They ain't hungry. I've seen 'em do that right after I saw them 
eating at Gasper's."

ESPY SAYS FREQUENT TRIPS TO HOME STATE AT GOVERNMENT EXPENSE WERE 'LEGITIMATE'; 
ETHICS: THE AGRICULTURE SECRETARY RELEASES TRAVEL RECORDS TO DISPEL ALLEGATIONS 
HE ACCEPTED TRIPS AND SPORTS TICKETS FROM PRIVATE FIRMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Agriculture Secretary Mike Espy made at least 20 government-paid trips to his 
home state of Mississippi during his first 20 months in office, many of them on 
weekends, according to travel documents released by his office Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Espy often conducted some official business on these trips, he 
acknowledged in an interview that he also used them as an opportunity to visit 
family, support his brother's bid for Congress and maintain relationships in 
Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were legitimate trips," insisted Espy, who released his travel records 
as part of an effort to dispel allegations that he improperly accepted travel 
and sports tickets from private firms with interests regulated by the 
Agriculture Department. His activities are under scrutiny by a court-appointed 
independent counsel, Los Angeles attorney Donald C. Smaltz. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no law that prevents top federal officials from scheduling official 
travel to locations where they also have personal or political interests, as 
long as they reimburse the government for any purely personal expenses incurred 
during the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 However, it is unusual for Cabinet members to spend so much time in their home 
states at government expense, according to informal surveys during previous 
administrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy's Mississippi jaunts punctuated an unusually hectic official travel 
schedule that took him to 114 cities in the United States and 16 foreign 
countries between the time he took office in January, 1993, and last month. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his more than 20 official trips to Mississippi, Espy said, he 
frequently visited his home state at his own expense. Divorced from his wife, 
who lives in Mississippi, he said he tries to visit his two children there as 
often as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, before releasing his travel records, Espy repaid $193 to the 
government for lodging in Jackson, Miss., more than a year ago that he 
originally claimed as a business expense and recently has deemed to be personal 
in nature. He said the decision was in line with his policy to be scrupulously 
careful about separating business and personal activities. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with The Times, Espy -- who served three terms in Congress 
representing a Mississippi district -- explained that he made more official 
trips to his home state than any other state because he has received an 
unusually large number of invitations from Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 He accepted eight of 102 invitations to make appearances in Mississippi in 
1993 and nine of 94 invitations in the first eight months of this year, he 
said. By comparison, he said, he accepted only one of the 75 invitations he 
received from California in 1993, and none of 49 California invitations this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, Richard E. Lyng, who was agriculture secretary for three years 
under President Ronald Reagan, said in an interview that he, too, made many 
trips to Mississippi during his tenure at the department because it is a rural 
state with major cotton and catfish farms. But Lyng, a Californian, added that 
he spent more time in states with more significant corn, beef, dairy and other 
agriculture interests such as Illinois, Iowa, Texas and California. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy made his first trip to Mississippi one day after he was sworn in as 
President Clinton's agriculture secretary Jan. 22, 1993. His first news 
conference took place at the Yazoo County Courthouse in his hometown of Yazoo 
City, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to hold my first news conference as secretary of agriculture in my 
hometown to show my appreciation for the support I have received from all 
Mississippians in years past," Espy told the assembled throng. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, with my first news conference, I hope to send a clear message throughout 
the country that I look forward to working for all of America. I hope to be an 
honest broker inside the Department of Agriculture for all Americans." 
</P>
<P>
 During that visit, Espy was asked by reporters about his older brother Henry's 
bid to succeed him in Congress. While declining to formally endorse his 
brother, Espy said of Henry: "He is extremely qualified. He is capable to fill 
this position but there are many others as well." 
</P>
<P>
 When Espy visited Mississippi again on Feb. 23, a fund-raising reception for 
his brother was part of the schedule. (Henry, the mayor of Clarksdale, was 
defeated in a special election to fill the congressional seat on March 30, 
1993.) 
</P>
<P>
 During his many Mississippi appearances, Espy addressed a joint session of the 
state Legislature, gave commencement speeches at Jackson State University and 
the University of Mississippi, spoke to the Communications Workers of America 
and attended a private ceremony for the slain civil rights leader, Medgar 
Evers. But frequently, his daily schedule in Mississippi listed only a few 
vaguely defined meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Espy said that he has always left it to a single aide, Betty Stern, to make 
the determination between official travel to be charged the government and 
personal travel to be paid from his own pocket. He said Stern has done the same 
job for seven previous agriculture secretaries. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the independent counsel's inquiry, Espy expressed confidence that he 
will be exonerated. He acknowledged that he may have been "inattentive to the 
perceptions of impropriety," but insisted that he has stirred controversy 
because he is "rocking the boat" at the Agriculture Department.

JUDGE RESTRICTS MEDI-CAL LIENS ON HOMES OF ELDERLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CLAIRE SPIEGEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A U.S. District Court judge in San Francisco ruled Friday that state Medi-Cal 
officials have improperly placed liens on the homes of hundreds of elderly 
Californians to recoup the cost of medical care provided to their dead spouses 
by the government. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling in a class-action lawsuit requires state officials to implement new 
procedures to ensure that elderly homeowners in the future get notice of 
impending liens and an opportunity to contest them. 
</P>
<P>
 Amitai Schwartz of San Francisco, an attorney for the plaintiffs, said the 
ruling effectively nullifies about 700 liens, ranging from $500 to $200,000, 
that state officials have placed since January on the homes of elderly people 
statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the new restrictions required by the judge may prove so costly for the 
state that they may wipe out any money recouped through the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ruling requires the state to go back to the drawing board with this 
program," Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Medi-Cal officials this year began systematically using property liens to 
recover Medi-Cal payments from homeowners after legislation providing for the 
program was passed by the state and federal legislation was amended.  
</P>
<P>
 The new lien program was designed to recoup more than $12 million a year for 
Medi-Cal, which provides health care to the poor and disabled. About $2.9 
billion annually, or 17% of the total Medi-Cal budget, is spent on nursing home 
care for about 75,000 impoverished Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 State Deputy Atty. Gen. Beverley Meyers, who declined to comment on the 
judge's ruling Friday, has defended the lien program in the past for plugging 
"a legal loophole" in the law that has long given favorable treatment to 
elderly homeowners and their heirs. She pointed out that the Medi-Cal program 
allows homeowners -- unlike renters -- to receive Medi-Cal benefits while 
sheltering a substantial asset -- their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are saying, 'Here's the state going after poor people for no 
good reason,' " Meyers said in a May interview. "But these are not necessarily 
poor people. They have homes. There is one house we know of that is worth about 
$400,000. . . . A person like that isn't indigent.' 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz argued that the nine homeowners he represented, like most of the 
others who have been hit by liens, are poor. 
</P>
<P>
 They were caught totally by surprise by the liens and given no information 
about how to appeal, he contended. In some cases, Schwartz said, the liens 
froze pending sales or property refinancing. In others, he said, the lien 
amount was not itemized or was miscalculated. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials issued about 400 liens through April, although 260 were 
withdrawn after officials conceded that they had been "erroneously issued." 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz said he recently learned that another 300 liens have been placed 
since May. 
</P>
<P>
 The liens, which were recorded on the homes of surviving spouses of deceased 
Medi-Cal beneficiaries over the age of 65, did not have to be paid immediately 
and did not force residents out of their homes prematurely, according to state 
officials. But they did unequivocally stake out the state's claim to payment, 
which had to be made when the house was sold, transferred or exchanged. 
</P>
<P>
 In his ruling Friday, U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker struck down the 
provision of the law that required payment of the lien at the time the house is 
sold, transferred or exchanged, but upheld provisions that payment must be made 
upon the death of the surviving spouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Atty. Gen. Meyers has opposed giving notice of liens before they are 
recorded because, she said, "surviving spouses and their savvy estate planners 
will transfer property to others in title only" to avoid payment.

STATE'S REPUBLICANS GATHER ON A HOPEFUL NOTE; POLITICS: IN CONTRAST TO BITTER 
1992 'UNITY' MEETING, GOP IS FOCUSED ON WINNING ON GOVERNOR'S, SENATE RACES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With electoral disaster looming just around the corner two years ago, 
California Republicans were so bitterly divided at their pre-election "unity" 
convention that the unofficial head of the party -- Gov. Pete Wilson -- stayed 
as far from the convention hotel as he could. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson used the excuse that his sunny September weekend was better spent out 
in the field working to get GOP legislators elected than defending himself in 
some stuffy meeting room against the barbs of the Republican right, with which 
he had feuded ever since taking office in January, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the picture is far different as an estimated 2,000 Republicans gather 
in Wilson's hometown for the pre-1994 election meeting with hopes of winning 
closely fought battles for governor and U.S. senator. 
</P>
<P>
 "This party is energized, focused and united," Republican Chairman Tirso del 
Junco, a Los Angeles surgeon, said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans have come together in 1994 behind the issues of crime and illegal 
immigration, added del Junco, who emigrated from Cuba in 1951, and have put 
behind them, at least for now, the most disputative quarrels over social 
issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a tremendous chance, according to all the polls, to not only reelect 
our governor, but to pick up a lot of seats (in the Legislature and Congress) 
if we do not become complacent," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is scheduled to deliver a showcase address at lunch today, with 
speculation that he might use the occasion to formally endorse the passage of 
Proposition 187, the controversial November ballot initiative that proposes to 
cut off state services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The convention also gives a platform to two potential GOP challengers to 
President Clinton in 1996. Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas will deliver the keynote 
address at the convention session Sunday. Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole will 
speak at tonight's dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 A battle over abortion rights at the 1992 convention in Los Angeles was one of 
the reasons Wilson found it more attractive to go stumping the field for 
Republican legislators. A major reason for conservative dissatisfaction with 
Wilson has been his support for abortion rights and gay rights. They rebelled 
even more strongly in 1991 when Wilson agreed to a $7-billion tax increase to 
get the state through a financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Wilson has modified his support for gay rights and taken a pledge 
against new taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two months after the 1992 convention, California Republicans 
suffered one of their greatest electoral debacles of modern times. George Bush 
became the first GOP nominee for President to fail to carry California since 
Barry Goldwater in 1964. Democrats Feinstein and Barbara Boxer both won Senate 
seats. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as a few months ago, Feinstein was California's most popular 
politician in the opinion polls, and was considered a virtual shoo-in for 
reelection. But freshman Rep. Mike Huffington of Santa Barbara has spent 
millions of his personal fortune on a television advertising campaign to erode 
her support. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's candidacy has been controversial even among some Republicans. 
Many conservative party members disagree with some of his moderate views. And 
others still are angry that Huffington, a relative newcomer from Texas, spent 
$3.5 million to defeat a popular Republican congressman, Robert Lagomarsino in 
the 1992 Republican primary.

JOAN MRLIK; INSPIRED CHILDREN'S CHARITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joan Riker Mrlik, better known as the infant Catherine Variety Sheridan who 
inspired Variety Club International's charitable work for children, has died at 
the age of 65. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Mrlik died Sept. 9 in Charleston, S.C., where she lived, the charitable 
organization announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Born on Thanksgiving Day, 1928, "Baby Catherine" was abandoned on Christmas 
Eve by a mother who said in a note that she had eight children and could not 
afford a ninth. The baby's name, she said, was Catherine. She left the baby in 
the nursery of the Sheridan Square Theater in Pittsburgh during a matinee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have always heard of the goodness of show business and I pray to God that 
you will look out for her," the mother's note said. 
</P>
<P>
 John H. Harris, who owned the theater, was one of 11 entertainment industry 
businessmen who had recently founded a social club in Pittsburgh that they 
named Variety. When a search for the mother was unsuccessful, Harris placed the 
child in Pittsburgh's Roselia Foundling Home, one of his mother's charities. He 
and his fellow Variety Club members decided that since the infant had been 
entrusted to show business people, they should adopt her and underwrite her 
financial care and education. 
</P>
<P>
 When she was 5, the much-publicized Baby Catherine was adopted by Norman and 
Gladys Riker, a Long Island, N.Y., couple who were among 300 couples screened 
by the club. The club "daddies" felt that the child could have a happier, more 
anonymous life in another state. 
</P>
<P>
 When the new parents met the child in Manhattan's Waldorf Astoria Hotel, they 
asked what she would like to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ate a huge bowl of whipped cream. I don't know why. I've never touched it 
since," she told The Times in 1980 when she attended the 52nd annual convention 
in Los Angeles of Variety Club International. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting with Baby Catherine, the 11 Pittsburgh businessmen became zealous 
about assisting foundlings and handicapped children. Today, Variety Club 
International raises more than $40 million annually to support children's 
charities, hospitals and camps throughout the United States and in eight other 
countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Renamed Joan Riker by her new parents, she grew up in New York. She earned a 
nursing degree from Cornell University in 1951 and served as a Navy nurse 
during the Korean War. Afterward, she joined the Foreign Service as a public 
health nurse in Saigon. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1957, she married Navy Lt. Michael Mrlik, with whom she had three sons, 
Michael and twins Richard and Robert, and a daughter, Lisa. The family lived in 
Asia for 20 years where Mrlik worked for United States Lines. Later they 
settled in Charleston where he was port manager and she worked as a part-time 
nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 1980 Variety convention, she became an ambassador promoting the 
charity's work on behalf of children.

 Former Police Chief Richard Hongisto committed civil rights violations in the 
removal of a newspaper from its racks, a jury found Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel decided Hongisto and two officers committed the violations by 
removing from news racks 2,000 copies of a free newspaper that lampooned the 
chief for ordering mass arrests of demonstrators after the verdict in the first 
Rodney G. King trial. A cartoon showed the chief in a lewd pose. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. District Court jury awarded $5,600 to the Bay Times for losses and 
$30,000 to its editor for emotional distress.

WYNN FILES LIBEL SUIT AGAINST LAS VEGAS PAPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Casino mogul Steve Wynn has filed a lawsuit against a Las Vegas tabloid, 
charging that the weekly publication libeled him in May by suggesting that he 
participated in money laundering and his daughter's kidnaping. 
</P>
<P>
 Wynn, chairman of Mirage Resorts Inc., filed the suit in District Court 
against Casino News, writer Debra Percell and the Center for Academic Research 
& Endowment. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the document, Casino News ran an article May 18 in which Percell 
asked: "Who was really trying to launder money? Wynn or Cuddy? Would Steve 
stoop so low as to involve his own daughter in such a scheme?" 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have never named Wynn as a suspect in the case.

WOMAN CHARGED IN TORTURE OF NEPHEW, 10 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH and MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 An Orange woman was so enraged by the possibility that her 10-year-old nephew 
was toying with her marijuana cigarettes that she seared his tongue with a 
red-hot knife and sexually assaulted him with a souvenir baseball bat, causing 
internal injuries that nearly killed the boy, a prosecutor alleged in court 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Medina, a playground supervisor at an elementary school, is believed 
to be the first person in Orange County to be charged with torture since the 
law was put on the books in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Medina, 30, appeared in court Friday to face four counts of felony child abuse 
and one count of torture. She hid her face from news cameras during the court 
session, during which she agreed to postpone her arraignment until Sept. 30. 
Central Municipal Court Judge Richard Stanford raised Medina's bail to $100,000 
after the prosecutor said he considered her a flight risk and possible danger 
to children. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense attorney Richard C. Gilbert said the charges in the case are 
trumped up and his client is being used as a guinea pig to experiment with a 
new law. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is remorseful for some of the conduct; other conduct she denies," Gilbert 
said. He said his client was lacking in parenting skills. The attorney did not 
concede that she had caused the boy's serious injuries, which he downplayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "You walk over to Juvenile Court now, and you'll see a hundred of these 
cases," he said. The boy remains hospitalized. Medina's own son, 9, has been 
placed at Orangewood, the county's home for neglected and abused children. 
</P>
<P>
 Medina's nephew told police his aunt choked him until he was unconscious, 
seared his tongue with a knife and made him take off his clothes -- so they 
would not be bloodied -- before she sodomized him with a souvenir baseball bat 
as punishment, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was concerned he might have been playing around with her marijuana 
cigarettes" after she found the child's fingerprints in the ashtray, said 
Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Charles Middleton, head of the child abuse 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
 As Cynthia Medina allegedly attacked the boy, he called to his uncle for help, 
but the uncle, Edward Medina, stayed in another room watching television, court 
records show. At one point, the uncle told his wife the boy might die if the 
attack persisted, according to the boy's account to police. Police said Edward 
Medina remains under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's child abuse registry received notification from a physician the 
day after the boy was injured, according to Timm Browne, a spokesman for the 
Orange Police Department. Doctors are required to report suspected child abuse 
within 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert said he is attempting to learn why the boy was sent home with his aunt 
and uncle after the doctor's examination.

LAS VEGAS WOMAN'S DEATH STILL A MYSTERY; CRIME: A SUSPECT IN A $1.8- MILLION 
BRINKS ROBBERY, SHE WAS FOUND DEAD IN MEXICO. TWO AUTOPSIES HAVE BEEN DONE, AND 
MORE TESTS ARE PLANNED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Authorities may never be able to determine what caused the death of a former 
dancer and model who died penniless in Mexico, weeks after she was involved in 
the heist of a Brinks armored car carrying $1.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark County Coroner Ron Flud said laboratory tests are planned as a follow-up 
to an autopsy conducted here Thursday on the body of Misty Leann Smith, the 
daughter of a former police officer who was found dead Sept. 5 in Puerto 
Vallarta. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may never know the cause of her death," Las Vegas Metro Police Sgt. Ken 
Hefner said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Flud concurred, saying the time elapsed between her death and the autopsy 
here, plus the fact a previous autopsy had been conducted by Mexican 
authorities, might preclude local authorities from ever knowing what killed 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to speculate on the cause of death, or reports that she had died 
of an insulin injection. Mexican authorities conducted an autopsy Sept. 7 and 
ruled that dehydration was the cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim's mother, Judy Smith, told the Las Vegas Review-Journal that police 
and the FBI "feel that Misty was murdered, from an overdose of insulin that was 
forced upon her." 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Smith said her daughter's body also showed signs of trauma, contradicting 
reports by Mexican authorities. Flud declined to say whether such signs were 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, 23, and her boyfriend, Anthony Frisco, 29, were indicted Aug. 30 on 
charges of robbery and car theft in connection with the Aug. 9 theft of the 
Brinks vehicle and $1.8 million in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Frisco was arrested by customs agents in San Juan, Puerto Rico Aug. 29 while 
carrying $1.56 million in cash. Efforts are being made to extradite him to Las 
Vegas.

UC IRVINE CHANCELLOR OUTLINES GOALS; EDUCATION: SHE SEEKS TO PLACE THE SCHOOL 
AMONG TOP RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS. AT LEAST ONE ACADEMIC DEPARTMENT WOULD BE 
DROPPED. 
</P>

 UC Irvine Chancellor Laurel L. Wilkening on Friday announced her long-awaited 
plan to propel the campus -- one of the University of California's two youngest 
-- into the ranks of the top 50 research universities in the country within six 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkening outlined her mission in a written report 14 months after she assumed 
the helm of the campus. Like the other UC schools, Irvine has been racked by 
budget cuts, and university officials have recommended further cutbacks. 
However, Wilkening suggested that only a few major cutbacks would be necessary, 
including closing the university's program in comparative culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want UCI to be the university of the 21st Century, and I don't think one 
exists right now," Wilkening said in a discussion with Times editors and 
reporters. "We can get a jump on our competitors." 
</P>
<P>
 She said funding for her vision would ideally come from local technology 
companies. She was not specific, however, about her plans for improving the 
university.  
</P>
<P>
 Her announcement about the future of the campus ended a long summer of 
anticipation for members of the UCI community. Many have been looking to her 
for direction on restructuring the 29-year-old university nestled in the grassy 
hills of Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 In reports released this year, two panels of UC Irvine professors and 
administrators suggested making vast cuts in academic and non-academic 
programs. They concluded that several departments, including education, 
physical education, and comparative culture, should be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 But in her announcement Friday, Wilkening made it clear she intends to salvage 
as many programs as possible while concentrating efforts on departments that 
are already highly esteemed. 
</P>
<P>
 Among her plans for the university, Wilkening said she would: 
</P>
<P>
 * Close the comparative culture program. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fold interdepartmental programs, such as Asian American studies and 
Chicano/Latino studies, into other departments. 
</P>
<P>
 * Consider closing the physical education department. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep open the education department, which had drawn strong support from 
Orange County educators in February when it was threatened with closure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had some very tough years in the University of California," said UC 
President Jack Peltason. "We've all had to re-establish priorities, think about 
our goals and what we want to do. This is a very thoughtful report, one that 
makes it very clear the campus has gone through a lot of consulting and 
thinking about the future." 
</P>
<P>
 On the whole, Wilkening avoided the controversial closures of several graduate 
schools that had characterized the painful contraction process at UCLA a year 
ago.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Wilkening emphasized pulling more research dollars into UC Irvine by 
encouraging contracts between campus researchers and Southern California 
biotechnical and biomedical companies. Her goal, published in a tabloid-sized, 
eight-page newspaper distributed on campus Friday, is to launch UC Irvine into 
the top 50 research universities nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students were encouraged by the chancellor's goals for the university, 
but worried about the emphasis on research. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her goal . . . is attainable," said Matthew Buttacavoli, an undergraduate who 
is active in student government. "My question is, if they can't find funding, 
will she sacrifice undergraduate programs or student services or student 
athletics?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkening said she does not expect to cut its intercollegiate athletics, but 
she added that decisions on cutting student services will depend on what 
students tell her during the upcoming year. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we really need is some creative thinking about how we do business here," 
Irvine graduate student Bryan Hannegan said. "Can we do more with less for more 
students?"

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; REPUBLICAN FARMERS ENDORSE FEINSTEIN, 
CITING RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rancher Jean Sagouspe was one of the many disbelievers in 1992 when Dianne 
Feinstein came to California's agricultural heartland during her first U.S. 
Senate campaign and promised she was a friend of the farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 She was a city slicker from San Francisco, he thought. A friend of the 
environmentalists and a supporter of their controversial 1990 initiative, Big 
Green. Surely, he figured, her appeals were nothing more than an election-year 
conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, however, Sagouspe joined prominent Republican rancher John Harris and 
more than two dozen other GOP farmers in saying they were wrong about 
Feinstein. On a number of important issues over the last two years, they said 
she has proved to be interested and responsive to agriculture. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you would have asked me if I would be standing here doing this a year ago, 
I would have said you were crazy," said Sagouspe, a Republican who put a 
Feinstein bumper sticker on his Ford Explorer on Friday on top of one that said 
"Don't Blame Me, I Voted for Bush." 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably nobody in this room voted for her when she ran against (appointed 
Republican Sen.) John Seymour," Sagouspe said at a news conference. ". . . But 
she has made a believer out of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein told the group she was not surprised to be met with skepticism when 
she campaigned in 1992 and lost most of the valley to her GOP rival.  
</P>
<P>
 "I am very emotional, because people here know what I said I would do, . . ." 
Feinstein said. "So for me, what this press conference means is promises made, 
promises kept." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's event included a steak luncheon fund-raiser for more than 100 people, 
mostly area farmers. It was held at one of California's landmarks, the Harris 
Ranch, well-known to drivers on Interstate 5 as the place northeast of Coalinga 
where a sea of black, brown and white cows seem to stretch to the horizon. The 
ranch also operates an inn and restaurant that is a popular stopping place for 
those making the long drive north or south. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, son of the ranch founder, is among the San Joaquin Valley's most 
influential political leaders. "Harris' name is mentioned in hushed tones in 
these parts," said one Democratic observer. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris traditionally backs Republicans and this year he is supporting Gov. 
Pete Wilson's bid for reelection. He also hosted an event last spring for 
farmers to hear from Feinstein's Republican rival, Mike Huffington. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday, Harris said, "In this case, Huffington doesn't really bring a lot 
to the party in terms of knowledge of agriculture and knowledge of California. 
In agriculture now, we have so many issues that are important, we have to have 
somebody who will work for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's event escalated the battle between Feinstein and Huffington over 
voters in the San Joaqin Valley. It is traditionally a Republican base of 
support and Huffington has declared that he will lose the race if he loses the 
valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But Feinstein has vigorously pursued support here from her former detractors. 
In addition to the farmers at Harris Ranch, Feinstein was endorsed earlier this 
year by the state's largest agricultural organization, the California Farm 
Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington, who hosted a fund-raiser Friday evening in San Francisco with 
former Housing Secretary Jack Kemp, attributed the Harris Ranch endorsements to 
farmers who are "hedging their bets" because they think Feinstein will win the 
race. Huffington added that he is confident the defectors will return to the 
GOP when they learn more about Feinstein's record. 
</P>
<P>
 "While Dianne Feinstein tries to play herself as the farmer's best friend, her 
past support for radical environmentalists proves that she is really more like 
Cesar Chavez in pearls," said Huffington spokeswoman Jennifer Grossman.

DECLINE AMONG LATINOS HELPS TO TRIM DUI CASES; LAW ENFORCEMENT: DRUNK-DRIVING 
ARRESTS IN STATE CONTINUE TO FALL. A SPANISH-LANGUAGE EDUCATION PROGRAM IS 
CITED AS A KEY FACTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Arrests for drunk driving continue to drop in California -- although not as 
sharply as in the past -- and the large number of Latinos among those arrested 
is gradually declining, according to statistics recently released by the 
California Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Latinos, who make up 25% of the state's population, still accounted 
for 46.5% of all arrests for DUI -- driving under the influence -- in 
California last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials attribute the decline in Latino arrests in part to a 5-year-old 
statewide Spanish-language education program disseminated through Roman 
Catholic churches, classes in English as a second language and billboards and 
posters at liquor stores and bars. 
</P>
<P>
 "This reduction in DUI arrests demonstrates an increase in awareness of the 
dangers of drinking and driving among the state's Hispanic population," 
California Highway Patrol Commissioner Maurice Hannigan said in a written 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Si Toma, No Maneje" (If You Drink, Don't Drive) program was established 
in 1989 by the state Office of Traffic Safety. When funds ran out in 1991, the 
not-for-profit Century Council took it over. The council, formed to combat 
alcohol abuse, is funded by beer, wine and liquor businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 According to statistics compiled by the state Department of Justice, there was 
a 16% decline in the number of misdemeanor drunk driving arrests statewide from 
1991 to 1992, reducing the number to 250,235. From 1992 to 1993, arrests were 
further reduced, to 224,935. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of Latinos among those arrested declined 7.21% in 1992 -- to 
112,956 -- and 7.26% in 1993, reducing the number to 104,755. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose Ann Rasic, director of Hispanic programs for the Century Council, said 
she was pleased the program's success can be quantified. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key is providing the information in Spanish because we have seen that it 
has been working in the English-speaking segment," Rasic said. 
</P>
<P>
 The program also is included in classes in English as a second language in 
more than 400 school districts statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Javier, an ESL teacher at Evans Community Adult School in Los Angeles, 
said that incorporating the ramifications of drunk driving into the curriculum 
on life skills makes sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are skills like writing checks or going into the supermarket," Javier 
said. "We're teaching the students that the ramifications of getting drunk and 
driving are getting arrested, having your car impounded and having your license 
revoked." 
</P>
<P>
 Xavier Flores, executive director of Pueblo y Salud, a social services agency 
in San Fernando, said that a 1990 study he conducted found that there were a 
large number of foreign-born Latinos who spoke only Spanish among first-time 
DUI offenders arrested in the Los Angeles Police Department's Foothill 
Division. However, such Latinos made up the smallest percentage of repeat DUI 
offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "That indicates to us that they are coming into the country not knowing the 
law, but once they found out the hard way and learn their lesson, they are not 
doing it again," Flores said.

LURCHING TOWARD HAITI INVASION; HOPING FOR THE BEST AGAINST ALL THE HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is still not certain the United States will have to use armed force to oust 
Haiti's dictators, but it is clear that some form and degree of U.S. military 
presence are now inevitable, if only to ensure that the transition from 
military to civilian rule is as peaceful as possible. This necessity is most 
unfortunate, given the history of U.S. military interventions in the Caribbean, 
including an occupation of Haiti from 1915 to 1934. That occupation was far 
more memorable for its length than its accomplishments. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a new U.S. effort to bring democracy to a place that has known little 
in its nearly 200 years as a nation need not be as futile as the earlier 
intervention. If it is as quick and efficient as President Clinton and other 
Administration officials promise -- and if it enjoys broad international 
support, now being marshaled -- it could lay the foundation for future 
stability in the Western Hemisphere's poorest nation. Let's hope for that, 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the nation-building can begin, there is the problem of wresting control 
of the government from the officials who three years ago ousted Haiti's first 
popularly elected president, Jean-Bertrand Aristide. The junta has put civilian 
puppets in key government posts but the real power rests with the big three -- 
Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, the army commander; Brig. Gen. Philippe Biambry, the 
army chief of staff, and Lt. Col. Michel-Joseph Francois, police chief in 
Haiti's capital, Port-au-Prince. 
</P>
<P>
 It is these three men who will be the main targets when and if U.S. military 
forces storm Haiti. Washington, in hopes of not having to turn to warfare to 
expel the junta, is offering the three safe passage out of the country if they 
agree to resign. That is why former President Jimmy Carter is leading a 
high-level delegation to Port-au-Prince this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics understandably question the morality of allowing the junta's 
leaders to simply walk away after they murdered political opponents and brought 
about an economic devastation that caused thousands of Haitians to flee to the 
United States as illegal immigrants. It is exceedingly distasteful to think of 
such thugs living in comfortable exile; however, there is a pragmatic reason 
for offering them a deal, and that is to avoid further loss of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Haitian military has shown itself to be brutally fierce in 
dealing with the island nation's own people, it is clearly no match for U.S. 
military force. The U.S. advantage is so overwhelming, in fact, that the wisest 
course of action for Washington clearly is not to use force unless it is 
absolutely necessary. Because once shooting starts it might be impossible to 
avoid casualties among the civilian population and "friendly fire" casualties 
among U.S. personnel. This is a lesson that the U.S. military ruefully learned 
during the invasion of Panama in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy casualties among Haitian combatants and civilians, either during or 
after the initial engagements, could make the difficult task of restoring 
democracy and rebuilding the Haitian economy all the harder. Such a military 
development could saddle Aristide -- and perhaps whoever is elected to succeed 
him when his term ends in 1996 -- with the image of having cooperated with a 
powerful nation viewed not as a liberator but as an aggressor and oppressive 
occupier. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a picture of the United States has lingered long after most of its 
interventions in Caribbean nations. Americans can only hope that this unhappy 
history does not repeat itself.

ATTORNEY DISPUTES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a response to your July 16 article "When the Lawyer's Bill is Out of 
Bounds," a reader wrote (letters, Aug. 1) about a fee dispute with his 
attorneys, and what he considered to be the less-than-satisfactory resolution 
of that dispute through the Attorney Client Fee Arbitration Program of the Los 
Angeles County Bar Assn. While I may sympathize with some of his feelings, I 
must correct some of his assertions about the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The County Bar's Fee Arbitration Program is a public service offered to 
clients and lawyers, operating under contract with the State Bar of California 
(the state agency that licenses and disciplines attorneys). The rules governing 
the program have been rigorously designed to ensure fairness. That is why the 
attorney must notify the client of the client's right to arbitrate the issue of 
any disputed fees before the attorney files a lawsuit to collect those fees, 
and that is why any lawsuit that has been filed will be stayed (postponed) 
until after the arbitration. Furthermore, the arbitration is mandatory if the 
client requests it, but the attorney may not force an unwilling client into 
arbitration, short of an enforceable written agreement to arbitrate. Unless 
both attorney and client agree to be bound by the arbitration award, either is 
free to reject the decision and later file a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the amount involved, a fee dispute may be heard by a single 
neutral arbitrator or a panel of three neutral arbitrators. If a panel of three 
arbitrators hears a dispute, the law requires that at least one be a 
non-attorney. Both attorney and non-attorney arbitrators are trained in 
specialized dispute resolution techniques. All arbitrators, attorneys and 
non-attorneys alike, volunteer their time, and receive no compensation for the 
use of their staff, facilities, etc. (For hearings that last more than two 
days, however, each arbitrator receives $200 for each half day of additional 
hearing.) 
</P>
<P>
 The fee for the service is currently 5% of the amount in dispute, up to a 
maximum charge of $3,500. The charge may be waived or reduced if the client is 
not able to pay. Also, the arbitrator has the power to order one party to 
reimburse the other party for all or part of any fee paid. 
</P>
<P>
 For the fiscal year 1992-1993, 782 petitions for fee arbitrations were filed. 
Of these, 282 awards were made. In 67% of these cases, the arbitration award 
reduced the amount of fees claimed due by the attorneys, in 12 cases to zero.

COLLEGE RANKINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While rankings are certainly important, your Sept. 6 Column One, "Rankings 
Rankle Academia," implies that high school counselors, parents and prospective 
college students rely almost exclusively on the snapshot portrayals of colleges 
and universities provided by the plethora of college guides. 
</P>
<P>
 Mount St. Mary's College is delighted to have been included, along with so 
many other fine institutions in Southern California, in the U.S. News & World 
Report top listings, as well as the new "Barron's Best Buys." The public is 
well-served by the comprehensive publication of comparative statistics and 
thumbnail descriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Prospective students are also well-served by visits to the campuses of 
colleges and universities that interest them. Colleges have personalities, too 
-- essential qualities that are difficult to describe and impossible to 
quantify. At MSMC, we think those qualities are related to our spirit of 
community, dedicated teaching faculty and heritage as a Catholic women's 
college. 
</P>
<P>
 Critical to our recruitment efforts at MSMC are the programs inviting 
potential applicants to spend the night in the dorms, talk informally with 
faculty and current students, and sit in on classes -- all as a means of 
determining the "fit" of a student to our particular institution. More than 
half of this year's freshmen participated in MSMC's visitation programs.

 The approval of universities and their ranking has become a major political 
issue in this country. As the president of the World Assn. of Universities and 
Colleges, an organization of some 30 institutions of merit worldwide, I have 
become aware of the damage done to many fine schools, especially those who 
offer quality distance learning, mentioned in your article. 
</P>
<P>
 Distance learning schools can be "degree mills" or they can offer the same 
high-caliber university education as a residence university. Unfortunately, 
editors without college degrees or those who are misinformed have seriously 
affected the high-quality alternative schools because they are influenced 
politically by residence schools who fear that the distance learning 
institutions are enrolling students who now have new options for acquiring 
academic degrees. It is time for someone in this country, or some agency, to 
reassess how universities are evaluated and presented to the public.

 Every year my seniors pore over the college "lists" from U.S. News and World 
Report and a variety of books that rank institutions. Many students believe 
that they've failed if they're denied admission to a top-10 college. Each year 
I watch with dismay the capriciousness of selection committees and try to 
explain to a rejected senior why someone far less qualified is chosen. The 
public needs to realize that college rankings are fun and possibly good for 
party discussions but are dreadfully inaccurate -- and unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, for instance, are 17 of the top 20 universities private? Most of my truly 
brilliant scholars never apply to these institutions because of prohibitive 
tuition and choose instead UC Berkeley, UCLA or UCSD. The Harvards, Stanfords 
and Yales often admit lesser but more affluent scholars and yet they remain in 
the select top 10. Over the past 30 years I've had hundreds of students attend 
the Ivys and Stanford, M.I.T. or Duke. None of these institutions have been as 
demanding and competitive for our graduates as the UCs and many of the private 
colleges are rightfully under fire for dispensing an unusually high percentage 
of A's.

CONTROVERSY OVER SOS INITIATIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 USC law professor Howard Chang's column on Prop. 187 -- the Save Our State 
initiative -- certainly reflects the kind of ethical bankruptcy that one might 
conclude pervades American law schools (Commentary, Sept. 6). Chang argues 
quite systematically, quite rationally, quite articulately, and is quite wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Prop. 187 is not malicious immigrant bashing. My mother came legally to the 
U.S. in 1956. She has olive skin and an accent. She is undoubtedly a 
"foreigner." She has never fallen prey to so-called immigrant bashing. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang should try to stop pushing his amoral, liberal agenda for a moment to 
realize that the only "bashing" going on is against those who have broken the 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang should toss aside his flowery language and take a look at Prop. 187 from 
a common-sense angle: Illegal immigration is illegal. It is indefensible. It is 
wrong. For a law professor, one would think that should make all the 
difference. 
</P>

 If Prop. 187 passes and California denies public schooling to children of 
undocumented immigrants, we'll be faced with an unpredictable number of idle 
kids not learning the basic skills of reading or writing or speaking English; 
combine this with their understandable anger at a society that forbids basic 
medical care for themselves and their families; add the dangerous frustration 
that they'll be unemployable when they reach work age. 
</P>
<P>
 What we'll have is a startling explosion of gangs with members who are very, 
very young. The existence of today's gang activity is frightening enough; the 
thought of disadvantaged and provoked preteens should scare all of us. 
</P>
<P>
 Prop. 187 was penned as a scare tactic to get rid of "them" and to save state 
money. Any money saved on schools (and that's a debatable issue in itself) 
would just be transferred to law enforcement agencies. So, what's the gain?  
</P>
<P>
 The proponents vividly call this a "Save Our State" initiative. If it becomes 
law, SOS is going to mean exactly that -- a call for help!

 Because of an undocumented worker, I have enjoyed life in the United States 
for 54 years. My father walked over from Mexico in 1918, God bless him. During 
my life, I have paid over a million dollars in taxes. Maybe it just feels like 
over a million dollars, I don't know. I do know that I have paid more in than I 
have taken out (so far). However, I did attend Cal State University for almost 
nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 I have been doing a lot of thinking on the immigration problem. I believe we 
can't deny a child or a person health care if they need it, and I also believe 
anyone has a right to be educated in our schools. On the other hand, it isn't 
fair to us taxpayers to foot the bill for these costs. Here's my solution: 
</P>
<P>
 Send a bill to the immigrant's country for whatever the cost of services we 
are providing for its citizens. We add a little bit for profit and a great deal 
for bureaucratic overhead, and maybe these countries will be more enthused 
about keeping their people in their country, and about creating the conditions 
that would make them want to stay. If they refuse to pay it, we simply deduct 
it from the foreign aid I'm sure we're providing.

WAR ON SMOKING: NO MORE MR. NICE GUY; MAJOR MEDICAL REPORT URGES STRONG AND 
CONTROVERSIAL REGULATORY MEASURES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most smokers begin at an early age and, of course, as a result of their 
addiction many die at an earlier age than they otherwise would. Dr. Paul R. 
Torrens of UCLA's School of Public Health says that the 1 million youths who 
each year become regular smokers take an average of 15 years off their lives 
and over their lifetimes cost the health care system at least $8.2 billion in 
added medical costs. Torrens is chairman of the Committee on Preventing 
Nicotine Addiction in Children and Youths of the Institute of Medicine, which 
provides advice on health policy to the National Academy of Sciences. In a new 
report, the institute urges more aggressive measures to offset the social 
forces that continue to induce so many teen-agers to begin smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 A youth-oriented approach to controlling nicotine addiction is not just 
sensible but imperative. Americans justifiably worry about the tolls taken by 
AIDS, illegal drugs, homicides. But combined deaths from these causes, as well 
as from vehicle accidents, alcohol, fires and suicide still fall short of the 
419,000 premature deaths each year from diseases related to smoking. In 1990 
Congress' Office of Technology Assessment estimated the social costs of smoking 
at $68 billion annually. Greater intervention to dissuade young people from 
ever starting to smoke ought to be a national priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Adults have been listening to warnings about smoking. In 1965 more than 40% of 
adult Americans smoked. By 1991 the figure was less than 26%. But the story for 
young people is less encouraging. "The prevalence of smoking by youths has 
remained basically unchanged since 1980," says the Institute of Medicine's 
report. Adolescents, as every parent learns, are contrarians. Perhaps it's just 
because smoking is so harmful that so many young people are attracted to it. In 
any event, new approaches to discourage young people from smoking must be 
tried. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobacco regulation is inherently a politically explosive subject. The 
Institute of Medicine study makes these among other strong regulatory 
proposals: a $2-a-pack increase in the federal cigarette tax, because for young 
people especially decisions on smoking are known to be price-sensitive; a ban 
on tobacco vending machines and self-service displays, to help restrict sales 
to minors; allowing state and local governments to regulate tobacco advertising 
and promotion within their borders; elimination of all advertising features 
that encourage the young to smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Controversial? Absolutely -- and inevitably. But clearly a proper subject for 
congressional debate and action, given the appallingly high costs related to 
smoking that are staring this nation in the face.

THREE CHEERS -- AND A BOO; WILSON MAKES THE RIGHT CALL ON TRIO OF BILLS BUT 
WRONGLY VETOES DOMESTIC-PARTNER LEGISLATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If April, as T. S. Eliot wrote, is the cruelest month, then for the governor 
of California September is surely the busiest. If you're keeping score, more 
than 1,000 bills remain on Gov. Pete Wilson's desk -- and he's signing or 
vetoing as fast as he can. 
</P>
<P>
 Four measures that Wilson has acted on are of special note. He was right on 
three of these. 
</P>
<P>
 AB 2802: Obviously recalling last year's devastating wildfires, Wilson 
prudently signed legislation authorizing a test program for the firefighting 
plane known as the CL-415, the "Super Scooper." 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadian-built aircraft, able to scoop up 1,600 gallons of water at a time 
to dump on fast-moving fires, could prove to be a key weapon in the state's 
firefighting arsenal, one it should have had long ago. But there still remains 
the very large matter of funding for the test program. The governor and the 
Legislature must write that check. 
</P>
<P>
 AB 3432: A bill authorizing localities to require attorney/lobbyists to 
register and disclose lobbying activities is short and to the point and will 
cost little. Earlier this year the Los Angeles City Council passed a similar 
disclosure ordinance, backed by the city Ethics Commission. The new law drew 
jeers from some lawyers who had tried to hide behind the attorney-client 
privilege to protect themselves from lobbying disclosure requirements. AB 3432 
reinforces the notion that a more open government is a cleaner government. 
Wilson deserves credit for signing it. 
</P>
<P>
 SB 1427: In the face of a high-priced public-relations campaign by 
pharmaceutical companies, Wilson did the right thing by vetoing a measure that 
would have limited a pharmacist's ability to substitute lower-cost generic 
drugs for brand-name pharmaceuticals. Proponents insisted the legislation would 
have protected patients and consumers. But the real protection would have been 
extended to the market for more expensive brand-name drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 AB 2810: Last week Wilson vetoed a measure to allow those in long-term 
relationships (mainly senior-citizen couples who fear losing Social Security 
benefits if they marry, and gay couples) to visit one another in the hospital 
and assume conservatorship if one partner is incapacitated. The bill would have 
also made it easier for a surviving partner to inherit joint property. 
</P>
<P>
 In his misconceived veto message, Wilson said the state should not encourage 
"some substitute" for marriage. However he then ordered the state Health 
Services Department to develop regulations allowing adults to designate 
whomever they choose as hospital visitors. Such rules won't have the same teeth 
as law, nor will they affect those hospitalized after being incapacitated 
without warning. A bad call.

CHINESE SWIMMERS SHOULD BE QUESTIONED

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gil Wong (Letters, Sept. 10) has it wrong. Racism or anti-Asian bias is not 
the reason American media, athletes and coaches are so suspicious of the 
performance of Chinese women swimmers at the World Championships in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason is quite simple: They've been caught cheating in the past and there 
are ample grounds for suspicion that they're up to their old tricks again.

DRUBBING BY PENN STATE GETS USC FANS' ATTENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's time for the USC administration to wake up and start producing a football 
program we can be proud of again. The alumni and fans deserve a team that wins 
every game, including the big ones like Penn State.

 Getting blown away and humiliated on national television is not tolerated by 
other major programs and should not be tolerated at USC.

<P>
 2. Play the young defensive backs and linemen. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Teach Mr. Heisman (Rob Johnson) how to run and pass, since he's obviously 
forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Get quarterback Kyle Wachholtz eligible to play this season.

 5. Show the defense a video of Ronnie Lott tackling.

<P>
 6. Recruit better.

 It is with increasing sadness that I continue to hear the two most vocal 
Dodgers, Brett Butler and Orel Hershiser, moaning that they are getting taken. 
</P>
<P>
 Do these poor folks with their million-dollar salaries give a tinker's damn 
about anyone but themselves? Do they care about the thousands of club 
employees, restaurant and bar owners and employees, cabbies, hotel personnel 
and others who derive a good portion of their income from baseball? These are 
the people getting taken. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Butler and Hershiser have been the finest, most upstanding examples 
of Christian athletes just about anywhere. Unfortunately, as much respect as I 
have for them on the field, that's how much I have lost for them off the field.

 It is ironic that while the baseball owners are trying so hard to impose a cap 
on players' salaries similar to the NBA cap, the NBA owners have lost their 
salary cap by signing free agents below market value and giving them the option 
to declare free agency after one year. 
</P>
<P>
 Human nature does not change. Some owners care primarily about profit and 
loss. Others care mostly about winning and will attempt to circumvent whatever 
salary cap eventually is agreed upon.

 Larry Stewart (TV/Radio Column, Sept. 9) is absolutely wrong, so tell him to

 If it wasn't for local fans, there would not be a big game of the week.If it 
wasn't for local fans, there would not be a Joe Montana or a Steve Young. If 
they stopped televising local games, soon there would be no local fans.

 Cornerback Todd Lyght is beginning his fourth season with the Rams and still 
looking for his first victory over the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 To achieve success, Lyght said, it begins with him and his play on 49er wide 
receiver Jerry Rice. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice, the NFL's all-time leader in touchdowns with 127, has scored 11 against 
the Rams and has more yards receiving against the Rams, 1,527, than against any 
other team.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's comparable to going out and trying to D-up Michael Jordan," Lyght said. 
"He's going to get some, but you have to make it so he's not going to be the 
game-breaker." T.J. SIMERS

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; DAVIS REMAINS OUT OF TOUCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Raiders haven't yet heard from defensive end Scott Davis, who has been 
AWOL since leaving their training headquarters Sept. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Davis doesn't return, he can plan on hearing from the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 There's this matter of a signing bonus, $1.05 million, received by the 
29-year-old lineman when he signed a four-year, $5.3-million contract this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 A clause in that contract says that "In the event player . . . leaves club 
without its consent, than player will forfeit any and all portions of the total 
bonus not having been earned." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, since Davis has played in only one game, and bonuses are 
calculated over a 17-week season, he would be entitled to keep a little less 
than $62,000 of that money. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders could take him to court for the rest. But more important, the 
money would not count against their salary cap, although the final 
determination on that must be made by the league. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonuses are spread over the length of the contract in terms of the salary cap. 
But whatever remains after a player leaves must be figured in the following 
year, meaning the Raiders would have $787,500 tacked onto their salary-cap 
total next year if Davis were not obligated to return the money. 
</P>

 Denver quarterback John Elway's statistics are better than ever under Coach 
Wade Phillips and offensive coordinator Jim Fassell, but over the last two 
seasons, the Broncos have a 0-6 record whenever he has passed for more than 300 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 So will the Raiders see a more conservative Elway? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, they're still the same," Coach Art Shell said about the Bronco offense. 
"They're still trying to go down deep with the ball. In watching film . . . 
(Elway's) still bombing away." 
</P>
<P>
 Elway may be without tight end Shannon Sharpe, who is listed as doubtful with 
a shoulder injury after missing last week's loss to the New York Jets, and 
running back Rod Bernstein is also listed as questionable with a hamstring 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Shell said rookie defensive tackle Austin Robbins will start against Denver if 
veteran Jerry Ball, who did not practice this week because of a hamstring 
injury, cannot play. . . . The only Raider ranking among the AFC leaders is 
punter Jeff Gossett, who is third with a 45.4-yard average. LONNIE WHITE

FORMING NEW BASEBALL LEAGUE SOUNDS PRETTY GOOD, BUT . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ZIPAY, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the sad silence after the momentous -- and moronic -- labor battle that 
dismantled the 1994 season and threatens the future of major league baseball, 
the whispers are becoming louder. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia Phillies catcher Darren Daulton says he thinks players could run 
a league better than the owners. Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Orel Hershiser 
believes the concept of a players' league should be seriously considered. 
Dodgers outfielder Brett Butler says he would play in a new league. 
</P>
<P>
 Agents such as Dick Moss, who represents players such as Butler, Andy Van 
Slyke and Andre Dawson, are exploring an alternate league in which players and 
investors would provide capital for franchises in return for equity. All income 
from gate receipts, media and merchandising would be pooled and profits or 
losses divided equally. A partnership wouldn't have the economic burdens or 
tension of the current system, and investors are interested, organizers say. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989 and 1990, Moss and attorney David LeFevre lined up eight teams for the 
United States Baseball League, with investors such as Donald Trump. The 
alliance collapsed after players signed long-term deals with their old teams. 
Hey, call it whatever: the World League, the North America Baseball 
Association, the Second Coming of American Baseball, it's all fantasy baseball. 
Or more accurately, a baseball fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
 The logistics, legal and financial hurdles are daunting and risky, sports 
business and marketing experts say. "It's always been one of the great 
theories," said Craig Tartasky, a sports consultant and executive director of 
the International Sports Summit, an annual gathering of leading industry 
executives. "It sounds great in the classroom, but it just doesn't play out 
practically." 
</P>
<P>
 Tartasky lists "a host of real problems to try to overcome in five months: 
They would have to solicit support, determine which facilities are available, 
define which players are legally available, sell sponsorships, negotiate with 
TV. Is the union, which has been fighting against a limit on salaries, prepared 
to take down its revenue structure: reduced ticket prices, less attendance, a 
decrease in advertising money? I'm not sure there are enough corporate 
sponsorships ready to buck major league baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Remember, the American Football League, American Basketball Association and 
World Hockey Association were created when salaries were a fraction of what 
they are today. Are there investors willing to spend tens of millions on 
speculation? 
</P>
<P>
 "If you begin with the assumption that major league baseball will be back 
eventually -- even if it's with minor-leaguers and players who flee the union, 
that's formidable competition," said one sports executive who said he has had 
discussions with agents about a rival league. "You're taking a tremendous 
chance unless all the ducks are in a row. So far, they're not close." 
</P>
<P>
 The anarchist in me thinks it could be a marvelous rebellion. Imagine a 
fan-friendly league, with earlier starting times, less expensive tickets. The 
realist says dream on. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's go through a start-up scenario. First, you need players. Faced with the 
prospect of a continued strike or a salary cap, the Players Association, along 
with some of the 200 free agents, such as Dave Winfield and Dennis Eckersley, 
forms a partnership with some Fortune 500 companies. Two big problems. Will 
players easily surrender lucrative marketing and benefits money? Maybe not. 
Will owners go to court to retain the contracts of individual players? 
Absolutely. The litigation delays the rest of the league's development for 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 Say that's resolved. Where to play? Many city-owned stadiums have exclusivity 
deals with the major league teams. The Dodgers and Cardinals own their 
ballparks. Some stadiums are available. The SunCoast Dome in Tampa/St. 
Petersburg, Pilot Field in Buffalo, the Superdome in New Orleans, RFK Stadium 
in Washington, the Coliseum in Los Angeles, Memorial Stadium in Baltimore. And 
Charlotte, Phoenix, Vancouver, Mexico City, and New Jersey might come up with 
something. But before April? Please. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, what about TV, which drives the professional sports machine? The 
proposed A-League, which was supposed to rival the NFL with teams backed by 
corporations such as Federal Express, never got off the ground last year. CBS 
backed down when it learned that some of the organizers simply wanted to prove 
that they should be considered for NFL expansion franchises. 
</P>
<P>
 As for a new baseball league, executives at the Fox Network, which has taken 
the rubber bands off Rupert Murdoch's bankroll to acquire rights to the 
National Football Conference and NHL, say they have zero interest. CBS Sports 
executives dismiss callers by saying simply: "We don't deal in hypotheticals." 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, a cable network, such as ESPN or Prime, might take a chance, but would 
anybody watch? "More than ever, fans are disenchanted and disgusted with major 
league baseball," said one sports TV executive, noting the continual national 
ratings decline. "And people not in that category now suffer from a raging 
indifference. You're asking me if people are going to go to a bogus baseball 
league game? Maybe once for the novelty. But they're not paying for skyboxes." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, who would run the league, sign and cut players? The players 
themselves? And where's the continuity, the credibility? Would they play 154 
games? How do you feel about 50?

WOODWARD POSES CHALLENGE TO HOLY BULL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREW BEYER, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Holy Bull won the Metropolitan Handicap, demolishing a field of top-class 
older rivals, he gave evidence that he is the best racehorse in the country. 
When he won the Travers Stakes, he displayed a combination of raw speed, 
stamina and courage that marked him as the best American racehorse in years. 
Under normal circumstances, the outcome of the Woodward Stakes might have been 
a forgone conclusion, a coronation of Holy Bull as 1994's horse of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many astute handicappers can't wait to bet against the favorite at Belmont 
Park Saturday. Holy Bull may be facing an insuperable challenge in this 1 
1/8-mile race. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a one-dimensional speedster; jockey Mike Smith can't restrain him and 
make him sit behind another horse -- even if the other horse is setting a 
suicidal pace. This is the gray colt's one weakness, and trainer Wayne Lukas 
tried to take advantage of it in the Travers by entering a "rabbit," a sprinter 
who would go all-out to set an early pace that would enervate Holy Bull. The 
strategy almost worked. After dueling for the lead, Holy Bull held on 
desperately to win by a neck over Concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how the Woodward could be any tougher than that race," Holy 
Bull's trainer Jimmy Croll said this week. But he is about to find out. Of all 
the thoroughbreds on this continent, none could have posed a more difficult 
test for Holy Bull than Bertrando. This is no cheap "rabbit" who will show 
speed for half a mile and succumb. Bertrando is as fast and classy as Holy 
Bull. He has seized the early lead in every start of his 18-race career. He won 
the Woodward by 13 1/2 lengths last year, and he earned the Eclipse Award as 
the champion older horse. 
</P>
<P>
 Bertrando is probably not the same horse he was in 1993; owner Edward Nahem 
decided to send him to stud in the winter and then bring him back to 
competition this summer. Bertrando was trounced in his first big test this 
year, the Pacific Classic at Del Mar, but he still had all of his old speed, 
running the first six furlongs of the 1 1/4-mile race in 1 minute 8 3/5 
seconds. If he shows that kind of speed again, he'll give Holy Bull the fight 
of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes are high for Holy Bull. Croll has declared that this will be the 
colt's last start of the year. (He is not nominated to the Breeders' Cup.) If 
he loses, and then sits out the rest of the season, he could jeopardize his 
claims to a championship. But a Woodward victory would clinch the horse of the 
year title. Even Go for Gin's trainer, Nick Zito, said, "If the Bull wins, I 
concede." 
</P>
<P>
 Can Holy Bull battle with Bertrando and still have enough energy left to beat 
his seven rivals in the Woodward? If there were a horse in the field who had 
comparable talent and a strong stretch kick, the Bull wouldn't have much of a 
chance. But the older horses in the race are not an exceptional group. Even in 
the best performances of their lives, Devil His Due, Colonial Affair and 
Tinners Way have never run as fast as Holy Bull does on an ordinary day. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Holy Bull's contemporary, Go for Gin, may be a formidable foe. He 
delivered solid performances in winning the Kentucky Derby and finishing second 
in the Preakness; Zito has freshened the colt and given him one prep race to 
rev him up for a fall campaign. He has speed, but he is tractable enough to sit 
behind the anticipated Holy Bull-Bertrando duel. 
</P>
<P>
 If Holy Bull is a short-priced favorite, betting against him might be a smart 
move, but I'm not going to do it. I have little confidence in any of his rivals 
(except, maybe, Go for Gin) and, moreover, I want to see Holy Bull win. He is a 
great horse, and he deserves to be recognized as such. If Holy Bull loses the 
Woodward after a fierce duel with Bertrando, few people are likely to give him 
credit for an honorable defeat. I am rooting for him to win and establish 
himself, unequivocally, as 1994's horse of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 I can resist betting the Woodward because there are so many other top 
attractions on the Belmont card -- the first of two Super Saturdays that are 
designed as prep races for the Breeders' Cup. The pick six here Saturday 
consists of six Grade I stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryland-based trainer Barclay Tagg will saddle one of the most interesting 
horses on the card, Royal Mountain Inn. The 5-year-old has displayed great 
promise throughout his career, but he has repeatedly been hindered by physical 
problems and has won only one stakes race. Tagg has been pointing him all 
summer for Saturday's $400,000 Man o' War Stakes, and Royal Mountain Inn seems 
poised to establish himself as one of the best turf runners in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The East's leading 2-year-old colts and fillies will contest the Futurity and 
Matron stakes. They are apt to confirm the prevailing opinion that there are no 
good juvenile colts this season, and that Lukas' undefeated filly Flanders may 
be the best 2-year-old of either sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettors handicapping the Vosburgh Stakes shouldn't be deceived by Virginia 
Rapids' last-place finish in his most recent start. The stretch-runner was 
hindered by a ridiculously slow pace in the Forego Handicap at Saratoga, but he 
had previously proved that he is the top seven-furlong runner in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how much excitement these other stakes generate, however, it is 
inconceivable that they will match the drama of the Woodward, as Holy Bull 
battles with Bertrando, puts him away and then braces for the late challenges 
that may determine the year's champion racehorse.

STATE OFFICIAL AND COX WORKED FOR FIRST PENSION; EMPLOYMENT: DEPARTMENT OF 
CORPORATIONS COMMISSIONER AND O.C. CONGRESSMAN ONCE DID LEGAL ANALYSIS FOR NOW 
BANKRUPT FIRM. 
</P>

<P>
 U.S. Rep. Christopher Cox and Gary Mendoza, state Department of Corporations 
commissioner, once performed legal work for a company that operated one of 
Orange County's longest running and most elaborate investment scams. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Cox and Mendoza both said Friday that they were unaware at the time 
that the company, First Pension Corp. in Irvine, was involved in any fraudulent 
activities, the men admitted to assisting in legal duties on behalf of the 
pension management company while they were attorneys at the Latham & Watkins 
law firm in Newport Beach during the mid-1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 First Pension was accused by the Securities and Exchange Commission in May of 
losing $121.5 million of investors' money in what has been described by the 
U.S. attorney's office as a Ponzi scheme -- where money from new investors is 
used to pay earlier ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox (R-Newport Beach) worked for Latham & Watkins from 1978 to 1986 before 
leaving to become a lawyer on the White House staff. He said he performed legal 
analysis on a plan to sell investment shares that was later abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time, I was simply talking to them about how it (the investment sale) 
would be done," Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview from his Washington office Friday, Cox said he was 
"astonished" when he first found out about First Pension's misdeeds, which 
originally came to light in April. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, which had an estimated 8,000 clients and accounts valued at as 
much as $350 million, filed for bankruptcy liquidation on April 22. 
</P>
<P>
 William E. Cooper, the once prominent Orange County businessman who owned 
First Pension, pleaded guilty Aug. 1 to two counts of federal mail fraud in 
relation to the scheme. Fellow First Pension operators Valerie Jensen and 
Robert E. Lindley have also admitted to a federal judge that beginning as far 
back as 1982 they controlled an elaborate pyramid scheme that misled clients 
into investing in nonexistent mortgages. The three will be sentenced for their 
crimes on Nov. 10; a scheduled Oct. 6 court date was recently rescheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza, whom Gov. Wilson appointed as Department of Corporations commissioner 
in July, 1993, said Friday that while he was an associate at Latham & Watkins 
in 1986 he performed work for another First Pension-related offering. 
</P>
<P>
 As corporations commissioner, Mendoza is responsible for leading his state 
agency in investigating and regulating California's corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza said he performed legal analysis on a proposed $50-million public 
offering that was a designed as an investment pool of first trust deed and 
second trust deed mortgages. The name of the First Pension-related investment 
fund was BMF Mortgage Income Fund. 
</P>
<P>
 That offering, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Sept. 29, 
1986, raised only about $5 million, according to attorney Don Henry, the 
court-appointed receiver who now is tracking the remaining assets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very surprised when I starting reading about First Pension -- as 
surprised as many of the investors," Mendoza said. "I did most of the grunt 
work on it (BMF). There was nothing out of the ordinary concerning that 
partnership. There was nothing I recall being unusual." 
</P>
<P>
 As an attorney with Latham & Watkins, Mendoza said he worked on drafting 
documents for BMF Mortgage Income Fund, one of the few First Pension offerings 
that was filed with the SEC, if not the only one. Most of the mortgage pool 
investments sold by First Pension companies were private offerings and did not 
need to be registered, according to the SEC. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Antola, a partner with Latham & Watkins in Los Angeles, said Friday the 
First Pension-related investment offering was a long time ago and said he was 
not aware of any problems with it. Latham & Watkins is currently representing a 
former First Pension principal in his federal criminal case.

PAYMENT ENDS U.S. COMPLAINT OF DEFENSE OVERBILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Parker Hannifin Corp., a major defense contractor with more than 1,600 
employees in Orange County, has paid $7.8 million to settle a federal claim 
that its Irvine-based Parker Bertea Aerospace subsidiary overcharged the 
government on 70 contracts in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 A Justice Department spokesman in Washington characterized the settlement as a 
medium-sized agreement in the government's stepped-up effort to identify 
contract fraud. More than 100 such settlement agreements have been worked out 
in the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement issued Friday, officials of Cleveland-based Parker Hannifin 
said that the company voluntarily reported its subsidiary's overcharging in 
1987 when it was discovered in an internal audit. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no fraud and the employees responsible for submitting the inflated 
charges were not aware "that the charging decisions they made violated 
government requirements or caused overpricing," said Joseph D. Whiteman, 
Parker's vice president and general counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice officials said that Parker Bertea provided "inflated and incorrect" 
pricing data to government officials on defense contracts it negotiated between 
July, 1982, and December, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the company did voluntarily report and repay $2.5 million in 
overcharges in 1987, Assistant U.S. Atty. Gen. Frank W. Hunger said, a federal 
review found an undisclosed additional amount of overcharging. Parker paid an 
additional $5.3 million to settle the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the company nor the Justice Department would say whether the 
additional payment covered only the amount actually overcharged or whether it 
also included a fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Colbert, a defense industry analyst with Prudential Securities Research 
in San Francisco, said that the settlement "is not going to jeopardize the 
company" because "defense is not all that important" to Parker Hannifin 
anymore. He said Parker does not have a history of defense contract problems 
and that the settlement "sounds like a slap on the wrist." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker Bertea manufactures aircraft hydraulic and pneumatic controls and fuel 
systems and gets about 40% of revenue from defense work, a spokeswoman said.

BASEMENTS UNEARTHED; DEVELOPERS WANT TO OFFER SOMETHING NEW; BUYERS LIKE THE 
SPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBORA VRANA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They are staples on the East Coast and facts of life in the Midwest, but 
basements have never truly found a home in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of year-round warm weather and the extra cost of constructing 
basements, developers in the West have typically chosen to build horizontally 
rather than vertically. Many firms have scoffed at the idea of basements, 
saying that outdoor-loving Californians just don't want them. 
</P>
<P>
 But Randall W. Lewis, executive vice president of Lewis Homes in Upland, is 
taking a gamble in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis Homes is building about 50 homes with basements in La Verne, making the 
Marshall Canyon Estates project one of the first new master-planned 
developments in Southern California to have them, according to real estate 
watchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an experiment. We wanted to offer buyers something different," Randall 
Lewis said. "We may be wrong, we may be right, but we'll know in about six 
months." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside Sacramento, Cresleigh Homes Corp. of San Francisco offered buyers the 
opportunity this year to double the size of a 1,186-square-foot, single-story 
home for as little as $55,000 with what it called a "California Basement." It 
was so sure of the concept's marketability that it even copyrighted the name. 
</P>
<P>
 The response: Buyers camped out, wanting unfinished or finished basements in 
53 of the 60 homes in the project. The master-planned development, thought to 
be the first modern development in California to have basements, sold out in 
three months. Now Cresleigh is planning to put basements in 96 homes in Folsom, 
northeast of the state capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a simple thing to build a basement -- you're talking about the 
difference between arithmetic and calculus," said Tom Wong, general manager of 
Cresleigh, who got hooked on the idea of basements after attending the 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology in Cambridge, where basements are common. 
"But the response we got was tremendous. People love them." 
</P>
<P>
 One of those people is Julie Stolzman. She and her husband, Joseph, who have a 
2-year-old daughter and another child on the way, were attracted to the idea of 
a basement as an enclosed play area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The family and living rooms are always so close together, but our rec room is 
the kind of space where children can really spread out," Stolzman said. "We 
bought the unfinished basement so we can fix it how we want to. It's great." 
</P>
<P>
 It remains to be seen whether more Southern California residents will pay tens 
of thousands of extra dollars to spend time in basement rumpus rooms, which 
average about 1,000 square feet -- about four or five times the size of an 
average family room and as large as many two-bedroom condos. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very unlikely," said Frank Foster, regional manager with Fieldstone Homes in 
Newport Beach, when asked whether the large Orange County home builder will 
ever put in basements. "I think you can structurally deal with the earthquake 
risk. The problem is what do you do with a basement in Southern California? 
</P>
<P>
 "You sure don't need it for a place to go for the kids to get out of the 
snow," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Basements are situated under the living space of a house but do not have to be 
completely underground. Typically, all four sides are surrounded by dirt, but 
many are surrounded on only three sides and open in the back, according to the 
Meyers Group, a Newport Beach real estate consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster said that while earthquake risks can be managed, the cost of building a 
basement, including disposing of the dirt, coupled with liability concerns 
regarding faulty construction, make basements unattractive to builders. 
</P>
<P>
 He also noted that it's almost impossible to find a subcontractor in Southern 
California who knows how to build a basement. At Cresleigh, Wong overcame that 
problem by hiring someone from the East to teach subcontractors on the job.  
</P>
<P>
 Cost and design difficulties notwithstanding, Centex Homes, America's largest 
home builder, is busily constructing basements in Maravilla), a 176-home 
project near Phoenix, said Mike Trailor, division president for Centex Homes. 
Buyers wanted basements in more than half the 89 homes in the first phase of 
the project, and were willing to pay $50,000 on top of the homes' $210,000 
price tags. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought it was a success -- it sold out quickly -- so we decided to offer 
basements again in the second phase," Trailor said. "Basements were a way to 
add more space to a single-story house, so instead of going up, we went down. 
And in Phoenix, the basement is a cooler environment." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Centex is considering basements in California, Trailor cautioned that 
basements are "appropriate in certain areas, but not a great alternative in any 
location -- you don't want to build basements everywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Bassenian/Lagoni Architects in Newport Beach helped design the partial 
basements for Lewis Homes' Marshall Canyon Estates and is currently working to 
design houses with basements for an Orange County developer, said company 
President Aram Bassenian. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some attempts at basements right here in Orange County," he said. 
"Someone needs to do it and prove it can be done." 
</P>
<P>
 But Cresleigh and Centex's successful efforts have not persuaded Michael 
Woodley, chief architect at Kaufman & Broad, California's largest home builder. 
Although Woodley said he is intrigued by the Cresleigh project, he is concerned 
about the costs of making basements safe during an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Cresleigh project sold so well, it leads me to believe there is some 
interest from buyers," he said. "I think you could design it to withstand 
earthquakes here in Southern California; I just think it's cost-prohibitive." 
</P>
<P>
 Several home builders, noting the success of new homes with traditional 
features such as front porches and detached garages, said basements are popular 
with buyers who plan to be in their homes longer and want a house that can grow 
and change as they do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do believe the front porches and the nostalgia of the 1990s all ties 
together. A lot of people see a basement as a traditional part of a house," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Lewis, he said he thinks his La Verne basements -- in single-family 
homes built into a hillside -- will appeal to both non-traditional families and 
transplanted Midwesterners. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seeing more untraditional families, so it's ideal for a mother-in-law, 
or kids coming home from college and living there for a couple of years," he 
said.

APPLE REVEALS PLAN ALLOWING FOR CLONING OF MACINTOSH COMPUTER; TECHNOLOGY: 
ANALYSTS DISAGREE ON WHETHER THE COMPANY WILL RECAPTURE MARKET FROM 
IBM-COMPATIBLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Apple Computer Inc., struggling to compete against the Intel-Microsoft 
juggernaut, on Friday revealed details of its long-discussed plan to license 
its technology and permit other companies to make clones of the Macintosh 
personal computer. 
</P>
<P>
 But Apple did not say whether any companies had yet signed on, nor would it 
disclose what conditions would be attached to such licenses.  
</P>
<P>
 The Macintosh clones -- which will be based on the new Power Macintosh design 
and will sport the licensees' own labels along with a new blue logo for the 
latest Mac software operating system -- are not expected to hit the market 
until the end of next year, according to Don Strickland, the Cupertino, Calif., 
company's vice president for licensing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Using the Mac OS licensing system as a way to build brand awareness, we think 
we can boost our worldwide market share to as much as 15% or 16% over the next 
three years," Strickland said. 
</P>
<P>
 Apple has been scrambling to hold on to a 10% share of the $80-billion global 
PC market. Meanwhile, machines containing Intel chips and running Microsoft's 
DOS and Windows operating systems have grabbed more than 80% of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Allowing others to license Mac hardware and software would expand the base of 
Macintosh machines and bring some revenue to Apple. But allowing clones carries 
big risks: Clone makers were decisive in establishing the IBM PC as a standard, 
but IBM -- which did little to protect its hardware design from license-free 
copying -- lost out as lower-cost manufacturers simply copied the hardware and 
licensed the software from Microsoft. 
</P>
<P>
 Opinion diverged widely Friday on Apple's chances of success. The company has 
been criticized for years for guarding the Mac technology too closely and thus 
losing the opportunity to establish it as a standard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too slow," said Philippe de Marcillac, director of worldwide PC research 
at Dataquest in San Jose, referring to the Apple licensing plan. "By being so 
slow, they are definitely limiting the gains they're going to make." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Hall, editor of MacWeek magazine in San Francisco, disagreed. "Now the 
world knows what it will take to build a Mac clone. Apple will pick up decent 
market share worldwide in two years." 
</P>
<P>
 Since introducing the Mac a decade ago, Apple has gained a devoted following 
among desktop publishers and other computer users for whom ease of use and good 
graphics were crucial. But for years Apple charged a premium, and the vast 
majority of users opted for cheaper IBM-compatible PCs -- and the Windows 
operating system has now eroded Apple's ease-of-use advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Apple introduced a new type of Mac based on the Power PC 
chip, giving the company a chance to revisit the licensing question. But Apple 
has reportedly failed to cut a deal with IBM -- an ally and co-developer of the 
Power PC -- and the slow rollout of the licensing plans has disappointed 
analysts. 
</P>
<P>
 Apple officials declined to name any prospective licensees Friday, noting that 
those companies want to control the timing of such announcements. However, 
trade publications have reported that Apple is close to deals with, among 
others, Motorola Inc., Vobis Microcomputer of Germany, Ing. C. Olivetti & Co. 
of Italy, Toshiba Corp. and Pioneer Electronic Corp. of Japan and Goldstar 
Technology Inc. of Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Strickland indicated that initially Apple expects to manufacture machines for 
licensees to help jump-start the process. Later, he said, with specifications 
supplied by Apple, the companies would be able to build their own hardware.

 Campbell Soup Co. is looking for the next Andy Warhol and promising at least 
15 minutes of fame. 
</P>
<P>
 The company is sponsoring a national contest for the best new artistic 
representation of its famous soup can, which Warhol turned into a pop-art icon 
that scandalized and revolutionized the art world in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Grand prize is $10,000 and "immortal fame -- or at least 15 minutes in the 
spotlight," Campbell said at a news conference, echoing Warhol's often-repeated 
remark that in a media-saturated future, everyone would be famous for 15 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Entry forms can be obtained by calling (800) 257-8443. 
</P>
<P>
 "The 'Art of Soup' contest is designed basically to introduce the next Andy 
Warhol, the next great contemporary artist," a spokesman said. Warhol became 
one of America's most famous artists before dying in 1987.

 The California Public Employees Retirement System, the nation's largest public 
pension fund, said Friday that it has selected insider James E. Burton as chief 
executive of the $80-billion fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Burton, 43, who had served as CalPERS' assistant executive officer for 
investment operations, said he will focus on improving the fund's operations 
and use of technology. Unlike his predecessor, Dale M. Hanson, Burton said he 
will play a much less visible role in promoting shareholder rights and the 
corporate governance movement, which seeks closer supervision of the management 
of publicly held companies. 
</P>
<P>
 But CalPERS' own programs to promote corporate governance will continue, 
Burton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson, who left CalPERS in May to run a private investment firm in San Diego, 
used his post and media savvy to become a prominent advocate of shareholder 
rights.  
</P>
<P>
 Under Hanson, CalPERS used its giant portfolio as leverage to pressure the 
directors of General Motors, International Business Machines, ITT, Occidental 
Petroleum, Lockheed and other corporations to become more independent of 
management and more accountable to shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dale was the star, and everything he did was written about," Burton said. 
"I'm a little more low-key. I do not intend to spend much of my time with the 
media. (Corporate governance) will work without a star." 
</P>
<P>
 Burton, who will earn $110,000 annually plus bonuses, was selected after a 
three-month search by the Sacramento-based organization, which administers the 
retirement, health and other benefits of more than 1 million members employed 
by a wide variety of public employers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jim brings the experience and perspective as both board member and staff to 
the position," William D. Crist, CalPERS president, said in a statement. "He 
has a clear grasp of the major issues confronting CalPERS. His insights and 
opinions are very much respected by the board." 
</P>
<P>
 Burton also won praise from a wide variety of outside investment officials and 
state employee groups as an energetic and knowledgeable financial manager.  
</P>
<P>
 "He has a lot of integrity and is a straight shooter," said Bob Zenz, general 
manager of the 100,000-member California State Employees Assn. "He is an 
excellent choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Burton's decision to play a less visible role in the shareholder 
rights arena, CalPERS, by virtue of its sheer size and frequent innovations, is 
expected to remain one of the leaders in the field. Other public pension funds, 
such as the Wisconsin Investment Board, have followed CalPERS' lead to become 
aggressive advocates of shareholder rights.  
</P>
<P>
 "CalPERS has continued to expand (its) program, with a new emphasis on 
(foreign company) holdings," said Howard D. Sherman, director of Institutional 
Shareholder Services, a Washington-based consulting firm that advises clients 
on corporate governance issues.

1,000 JOBS EXPECTED TO GO IN FIRST INTERSTATE REVAMP; FINANCE: CALIFORNIA AND 
WASHINGTON -- WHERE BANK HAS EXPANDED AGGRESSIVELY -- ARE LIKELY TO TAKE MOST 
OF THE CUTS. 
</P>

 First Interstate Bank employees across Southern California are bracing 
themselves for bad news next week, when the financial services giant is to 
announce a long-awaited restructuring plan that sources say will include the 
firing of about 1,000 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Bank officials would not comment about the plans ahead of a Tuesday meeting 
with industry analysts in New York. However, a First Interstate manager 
familiar with the plans said about 1,000 of the bank's 28,000 workers will be 
laid off. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 1,800 employees have already had their applications for an 
early-retirement program approved, and many of them have already left the 
company, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts expect the early-retirement program and other cost-cutting moves to 
result in a one-time charge of between $150 million and $200 million against 
earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 First Interstate's holding company, First Interstate Bancorp, announced its 
intentions in March to restructure its operations and trim staff. The Los 
Angeles-based bank simultaneously announced plans to raise its dividend and 
increase a stock-buyback program, in part to fend off a possible takeover by 
archrival Wells Fargo Bank or another suitor. 
</P>
<P>
 "First Interstate is one of the last major banks to make big cuts in its 
staff," said Phil Colaco, an analyst for SNL Securities in Charlottesville, Va. 
"The fact that they've taken so long to do it tells me that they've put a lot 
of thought into where the cuts should be made -- which means that their profits 
should go up without a noticeable decline in customer service." 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of the layoffs are expected to come from First Interstate's 
operations in California and Washington, the two states where the bank has been 
on an aggressive acquisition binge. About 9,300 First Interstate workers are in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the banks we've picked up (over the past 18 months) have branches 
that are just a block away from our own branches," a First Interstate source 
said Friday. "We've closed some of those branches, but we have to close some 
more -- and that means that some jobs are obviously going to be lost." 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who will fall victim to layoffs in the coming months are an 
undetermined number of employees at Bank of A. Levy, the 112-year-old Ventura 
County company that First Interstate purchased last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of A. Levy's 17 offices in the county are close to First Interstate's 
eight branches in the area, and First Interstate has already said the merger 
will cost some of the smaller bank's 275 workers their jobs.

NAVY AWARDS HUGHES KEY MISSILE CONTRACT; DEFENSE: JOB CUTS HELP THE COMPANY 
OUTBID MCDONNELL DOUGLAS FOR THE TOMAHAWK, BUT THE WIN WILL ADD FEW JOBS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hughes Aircraft Co., besting McDonnell Douglas Corp. in one of the most 
closely watched Pentagon contests of the year, was picked Friday to be the sole 
builder of Tomahawk missiles in a contract valued at nearly $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy award calls for Los Angeles-based Hughes to build about 1,000 
missiles over the next five years, assuming all the options on the contract are 
exercised. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Hughes and McDonnell have been making the cruise missile, which is 
launched from ships and submarines to strike sea and land targets, since the 
early 1980s. Hughes obtained the Tomahawk business when it bought General 
Dynamics' missile line in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the victory provides on obvious financial boost for Hughes, a unit of 
General Motors Corp., it won't have an impact on Hughes' Southern California 
work force. Hughes builds the Tomahawk and several other types of missiles at 
its 7,000-employee plant in Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Hughes job cuts in Southern California during the past two years 
contributed to its victory on the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 After Hughes bought General Dynamics' missile line, it consolidated its 
missile operations in Tucson and vacated plants in Canoga Park, San Diego and 
other places, eliminating about 5,000 jobs. The money saved by the move helped 
Hughes' Tomahawk bid by limiting the price it proposed charging the Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 The award is "proof that our effort to become more competitive by 
consolidating . . . is working," Chairman C. Michael Armstrong said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract probably won't require a large increase in jobs in Tucson because 
the workers there should be able to absorb the extra work, according to Hughes 
spokesman Glenn Hillin. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Navy's missile needs declining in the post-Cold War era, the Pentagon 
decided a year ago to have both companies vie for a "winner-take-all" contract 
to make the Tomahawk during the rest of the decade.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy estimates the change will save it $50 million a year in fixed costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very large victory for Hughes," said C. Donald Scales, head of the 
defense practice for EDS Management Consulting Services in Los Angeles. "It 
obviously positions them well going into the next century." 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes' proposal was chosen because of its price, technical expertise and the 
Hughes' management experience, among other factors, said Navy spokesman Lt. 
Conrad Chun. He declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 For McDonnell Douglas, the decision it likely to have dire consequences for 
its work force in Titusville, Fla., where the company builds its Tomahawks. 
</P>
<P>
 The St. Louis-based defense giant had said that if it lost the contest, it 
would probably close the 1,200-employee Titusville site after completing its 
existing Tomahawk backlog in mid-1995. McDonnell has only one other major 
missile program, the Navy's Harpoon missile for destroying enemy ships. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been studying a number of plans" to shutter the Florida plant, and 
"now we'll do that in earnest," McDonnell spokesman Tom Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We're surprised and disappointed" by the Navy's decision, Williams said. "We 
believed we had submitted a very cost-effective proposal that included 
realistic pricing and provided high value." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tomahawk, a 3,000-pound missile with a range of more than 700 miles, led 
the U.S. attack on Iraqi forces in the early days of the Persian Gulf War in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes also builds the Advanced Medium Range Air-to-Air (AMRAAM), Standard, 
Maverick, Sparrow and TOW missiles for the Pentagon.

AIRPORT HOLDS OFF ON PLAN TO BENEFIT COMMUTER FLIERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Wayne Airport's managers, at the request of federal regulators, are 
delaying for at least a week the delivery of their controversial proposal for 
allowing long-haul operators to give some of their flight slots to commuter 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. government is still reviewing the proposal for possible conflicts 
with federal rules and regulations.Once they receive federal clearance, airport 
managers plan to deliver the proposal to the Airport Commission, which will 
review it before sending it on to the Board of Supervisors for a vote.

 CKE Restaurants Inc.: The Anaheim parent company of Carl Karcher Enterprises

 GTE California to Cut 350 Hourly Jobs: The Thousand Oaks-based firm also said 
it will reduce the number of contract positions.The cuts will be made through 
attrition, buyouts and, if necessary, layoffs, GTE said. It said the move 
reflects the use of new, less labor-intensive systems and processes expected to 
improve customer service, reduce costs and streamline operations. The company 
is facing increased competition as it prepares for Jan. 1, when it will start 
competing with long-distance companies to handle its customers' regional toll 
calls. The company will offer two buyout programs as part of the negotiated 
labor agreement between GTE and various bargaining units that represent its 
hourly employees throughout the country.

 Northrop Grumman Plans More B-2 Cuts: The aerospace company said about 2,000 
more jobs related to the Stealth bomber will be eliminated in Pico Rivera and 
Palmdale next year as the company's contract to build 20 of the $2-billion 
aircraft winds down.Northrop Grumman, which disclosed the figures in an 
employee newsletter, also said B-2 job cuts this year will reach about 1,600 
instead the 1,300 originally forecast. By 1996, its B-2 work force -- which 
peaked at 13,172 in 1992 -- will drop to about 8,000. The company has already 
said the Pico Rivera plant will close in the late 1990s unless more of the 
planes are ordered.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; DOW DROPS 20.53 AS YIELDS HIT 2-YEAR HIGH

 Government bond yields rocketed to their highest levels in more than two 
years, sending prices plunging after release of a report suggesting that 
factory use is growing fast enough to accelerate inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks followed bond prices lower, snapping the market's three-day winning 
streak that had lifted the Dow Jones industrial index to a seven-month high. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors began dumping bonds after the Federal Reserve Board said industrial 
production surged 0.7% in August, the 15th straight advance. 
</P>
<P>
 The central bank also reported that U.S. factories had reached operating 
capacity of more than 84% in August, a level often cited as a threshold for 
inflation pressures. The new level of 84.7% is up 0.4% from July. 
</P>
<P>
 By day's end, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond yield climbed to 7.77%, 
its highest closing since June 30, 1992. It closed at 7.63% on Thursday. Its 
prices, which move in the opposite direction, tumbled 1 9/16 points, or $15.63 
per $1,000 in face value.  
</P>
<P>
 The report of economic strength fanned investors' worries that inflation will 
rise in coming months and compel the Federal Reserve Board to push interest 
rates higher at its November policy-making meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Sorrentino, an economist with Stone & McCarthy Research Associates Inc. 
in Princeton, N.J., said the news raised concerns that a supply crunch in 
popular goods could push up prices at the consumer level. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average closed 20.53 points lower at 
3,933.35, in heavy trading dominated by the expiration of stock futures and 
options. 
</P>
<P>
 The broader market took its cue from the blue chip indicator, with declining 
issues outnumbering gainers by about 2 to 1 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow had rallied 93.54 points in the previous three trading sessions, 
propelling the index Thursday to a seven-month high of 3,953.88, its best 
closing level since the Fed started raising interest rates in early February. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of Friday's volume was handled in the first 1 1/2 hours as the market 
went to its sixth-busiest day in history. Big Board volume came to 410.78 
million shares, up from Thursday's 281.16 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Thursday's surge and Friday's drop in stock prices was related to 
furious efforts to complete trading in options and futures tied to stock market 
indexes before Friday's expiration. Four times each year, the options and 
futures expire at the same time in what's known as a "triple-witching hour," 
frequently causing broad price swings in the underlying stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * IBM bucked the market trend, rising 1 1/4 to 71 after Goldman Sachs set a 
six- to 12-month target of $80 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 * ITT rose 1 7/8 to 82 after saying it plans to seek buyers for its ITT 
Financial unit. 
</P>
<P>
 * American Income Holding jumped 3 7/8 to 34 on news it will be acquired for 
$35 a share by a unit of Torchmark Corp. Torchmark rose 3/4 to 43. 
</P>
<P>
 * Calgon Carbon said its third-quarter earnings would be below forecasts. Its 
shares fell 3/4 to 12 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Orthomet, maker of hip and knee replacements, surged 2 1/8 to 10 3/8 after 
it said it was being bought by Wright Medical Technology, a private company, 
for $11 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas stocks also closed lower. In London, the FTSE-100 average fell 47.6 
points to 3,065.1, a drop of 74.2 points from a week ago, while in Frankfurt, 
the 30-share DAX average closed up 4.75 points at 2,118.73. Tokyo's Nikkei 
225-share average ended at 19,796.26, down 123.12 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's Bolsa was closed for a national holiday.

 Salomon Party Planner Gets Probation: Kathy Tompkins, 38, who once earned 
$150,000 a year arranging parties and conferences around the world, had pleaded 
guilty to submitting bogus invoices to Salomon Bros.She was sentenced to five 
years' probation and ordered to undergo psychiatric counseling. Tompkins' 
defense lawyer said the crimes resulted from stress and family problems. She 
has repaid $400,000 from her pension fund and from the sale of jewelry bought 
with Salomon funds. From June, 1992, to October, 1993, Tompkins boosted her 
income by turning in phony invoices claiming she had purchased china,

PEOPLE: ROBERT W. BURDICK, EDITOR OF THE DAILY NEWS, RESIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The editor of the Daily News of Los Angeles has resigned, it was announced 
Friday. He is the second top-ranking official to leave the Woodland Hills-based 
newspaper in two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert W. Burdick, 46, who has been with the paper for 10 years, the last 
seven as editor, will leave to become managing editor of the Rocky Mountain 
News in Denver. His resignation follows last month's announcement that James 
Lacher was leaving his post as executive vice president to take a position 
elsewhere in the empire of Daily News owner and financier Jack Kent Cooke, who 
earlier this year put the Daily News up for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Burdick will remain at the paper for a short period, Daily News spokeswoman 
Lynne T. Jewell said, adding that the paper has begun a search for his 
replacement. The search will initially be focused in-house, although outside 
candidates might also be considered, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacher was replaced by Larry T. Beasley, who took over the positions of 
president and chief executive. Beasley, a longtime newspaper executive, is 
known for turning around money-losing newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Cooke hired the New York investment banking firm Lazard Freres & Co. 
to find a buyer for the Daily News. Cooke could not be reached for comment 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jewell said Burdick's departure is not connected with any efforts by Cooke to 
sell the paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooke also owns the Washington Redskins football team, the Chrysler Building 
in New York, cable TV holdings and a horse-breeding farm in Kentucky.

INDUSTRIAL OUTPUT RISES 0.7% IN AUGUST; ECONOMY: CAPACITY-USE RATE HITS 84.7%, 
HIGHEST IN FIVE YEARS. SOME EXPERTS SAY FED RATE HIKE IS NOW ASSURED.

<P>
 Industrial output surged in August due to a big jump in the production of new 
cars, the Federal Reserve Board said Friday, and inflation fears were reignited 
on the news that factories were pushed to their highest operating levels in 
more than five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Industrial output rose 0.7% overall in August -- the strongest monthly rise 
since March, largely due to the auto industry roaring back with sharply higher 
production.Manufacturing of other goods -- from computers, metals, machinery 
and petroleum products to lumber and paper -- also picked up from July. 
</P>
<P>
 "The basic message is that manufacturing is still in a full-blown cyclical 
advance," said economist Robert Dederick of Northern Trust Co. in Chicago. 
"Right now, the auto industry has shifted into overdrive, and it's pulling the 
whole economy along with it." 
</P>
<P>
 The most startling part of the August report is the surge in the capacity-use 
rate to 84.7% -- the highest since April, 1989, when factories also ran at 
84.7% of capacity, a level clearly regarded as likely to fan inflation. In 
addition, production gains for May, June and July were all revised upward, to 
0.5%, 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively, from previously reported rises of 0.3%, 0.5% 
and 0.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's policy-setting Federal Open Market Committee meets Sept. 27 and 
again Nov. 15 to consider whether more interest rate increases are needed to 
keep inflation in check. 
</P>
<P>
 "The numbers were shockingly strong," said David Jones of Aubrey G. Lanston & 
Co., a New York government securities dealer. 
</P>
<P>
 He said they practically assure that the Fed will raise short-term interest 
rates a sixth time this year, possibly before its November meeting. Industrial

 Safeco Hikes Earthquake Loss Estimate to $225 Million: The parent of Safeco 
Insurance Co. had originally estimated its losses in the Jan. 17 Northridge 
quake at $175 million.Seattle-based Safeco Corp. becomes the second major 
insurer to sharply increase its loss estimate this month. A week ago, 20th 
Century Industries boosted its loss estimate to $815 million from $685 million. 
"As we work with customers and contractors in repairing homes and buildings, we 
continue to discover even more damage," said Boh A. Dickey, executive vice 
president. Safeco stock closed at $54 a share, down 37.5 cents, in trading on 
the New York Stock Exchange.

PUNK COLLECTION? HEAR! HEAR! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding Mike Boehm's tremendously definitive, insightful article "A 
Compilation Should Be Our Next Offspring" (Aug. 18), I certainly hope I speak 
for the silent majority of many longtime Orange County punk scene warhorses 
when I say that never (at least in an O.C. daily) has there ever been a more 
accurate piece done on our genre than this gem. 
</P>
<P>
 As a veteran of well over 1,000 punk, roots-rock and blues gigs spanning the 
last 15 years or so, I feel qualified to say that, for starters, it is very 
refreshing to know that someone in a position of strength, such as Mike, cares 
enough to help orchestrate such an evolutionary project as the one he 
suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 I can name at least 10 albums that have given me goosebumps every time I've 
heard 'em. And Mr. Boehm, they were, amazingly enough, all listed among your 
"most essential tracks." I agree, if done correctly, this could be the most 
happening punk compilation ever done. If not for these pioneers, there most 
certainly would be no Green Day, Smashing Pumpkins, Nirvana, STP et al.  
</P>
<P>
 I agree that "Colonel" Jim Guerinot should be the domo behind this punk 
steering wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike, thanks for caring, and keep up the quality work.

'HATFUL OF RAIN' SOARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was truly thrilled by the production of "A Hatful of Rain" at the Ensemble 
Theatre in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 What a wonderful surprise to find that we have such a great little theater in 
this area and one that definitely should be better noticed by our 
theater-hungry public.The actor who played Johnny the eldest son (David 
Boreanaz) was so convincing that I totally forgot that we were only about 10 
people in the audience. This was truly a shame, since all the actors were 
wonderful in their delivery of this very physical play. 
</P>
<P>
 Also notable were the marvelous actors who portrayed the younger brother, wife 
and father. Even the actors who played the crooks who hook Johnny were very 
convincing.

 Re "Out of the TV Newsroom Closet" (Sept. 3): 
</P>
<P>
 It is beyond me why the homosexual/heterosexual orientation of a news reader 
should have any bearing on the substance or the import of the news.There is 
much too much emphasis placed on this aspect of news reading in Garrett 
Glaser's comments. Should news from Bosnia have a bisexual slant? From Rwanda a 
gay perspective? Did the crime bill have a heterosexual dimension that I 
missed? 
</P>
<P>
 Let news copy be prepared accurately, honestly and impartially and be read 
(and shown) clearly, intelligently and without ostentatious showmanship.

CLASSICAL MUSIC MONTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks to Lynne Heffley, Los Angeles is now aware that September is Classical 
Music Month, and she gave suggestions for good listening ("Classical Music Hits 
the Right Notes for Children," Sept. 6). 
</P>
<P>
 But classical music needs everyone's participation! Adults and children alike 
should celebrate by getting involved in some classical music.Join a choir, take 
up a new or neglected musical instrument, perform chamber music, provide 
lessons for someone, play a recording for a friend, listen to classical music 
radio, take a friend to the Philharmonic. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Sidney R. Yates (D-Ill.) got the proclamation through Congress. Let's 
write to our representatives and request that our state reinstitute music 
programs in every school. Let's demand support for federal arts funding on the 
level of every other civilized nation.

THE PAIN THAT MATTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I agree with Howard Rosenberg that Jay Leno's eulogy for his father was 
heartfelt and touching ("Jay Leno's Eulogy Does His Dad Proud," Aug. 29). I was 
moved but couldn't help being annoyed, especially by Leno's comments that "it's 
lonely at the top." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back a few months, it would have been nice for President Clinton to 
have had a breather when his mother passed away. Not only were there picketers 
at the funeral but political foes; and comics, including Leno, didn't let up on 
their attacks on the President for even a week. One could only begin to guess 
at the meaning of "lonely at the top." 
</P>
<P>
 It is reminiscent of Joan Rivers' anorexia jokes about the late Karen 
Carpenter with no regard for Carpenter's family or basic decency. But when 
Rivers lost her husband, Edgar, to suicide, she was sobbing all over TV and 
initiating a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 We all have pain in our lives, but it's sad to think that some people feel 
that theirs is all that matters.

STEVIE NICKS AT GREEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Yes, I do believe it's been nearly 20 years since Stevie Nicks graced our 
presence with Fleetwood Mac ("Time Stands Still at Greek for Stevie Nicks and 
Fans," Aug. 27).  
</P>
<P>
 I was at one show, and it did not appear to me that Nicks was in denial, as 
Steve Hochman says.We fans know Nicks as a dramatic individual. Her songs have 
meaning, all of them. She expresses them with great individualism and heart. No 
bad review from Hochman will ever change that. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicks' old songs have special meaning to us -- "Dreams," "Rhiannon," "Gold 
Dust Woman," "Landslide" and "I Need to Know" -- as they do to her. Maybe next 
time Nicks is in town Hochman could try to see the tradition being performed.

CHAPPELL'S BLANCHE DUBOIS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kandis Chappell is as fragile, as delicate, as fine-boned, as feminine, as 
achingly convincing a Blanche DuBois as I have ever seen ("Some Strong 
Performances Power This 'Streetcar,' " Sept. 12).I saw Jessica Tandy and Vivien 
Leigh in the role, and Chappell gives both a run for their money. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe Tennessee Williams, whom I have studied for more than 35 years, 
would thrill to her performance as I did. The South Coast Repertory production 
of "A Streetcar Named Desire" is flawless.

STYLE OR SUBSTANCE: REDOING KCOP NEWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was a news reporter and producer at KCOP-TV from 1985 to 1992 and found the 
latest self-serving comments by the current news director, Jeff Wald, to be 
pretty amusing ("Channel 13 Struggles to Redo the News," Sept. 7). 
</P>
<P>
 Wald is correct when he says the station was an also-ran in local news before 
his arrival, just as it is today.But to say KCOP's news was "invisible" and a 
"rip and read operation" is disingenuous. 
</P>
<P>
 The truth, which Wald conveniently forgets, is that a small staff with meager 
resources produced better ratings and a more credible newscast than what KCOP 
offers today. It was the first and only time the news department was profitable 
for the station. 
</P>
<P>
 The mistake that Wald and General Manager Rick Feldman have made is in putting 
their faith and money in the cosmetics of television; a multimillion-dollar 
newsroom, quirky format, bizarre camera angles, and anchors who walk around 
aimlessly. They have lost sight of the simple truth that viewers want a 
straightforward approach to news, delivered to them by credible people in a 
credible manner. 
</P>
<P>
 Anything less than that will turn viewers off, just as they have turned off 
"Real News."

SAD SACK HUMOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I must differ with Cathy Curtis' assessment that the "heart" of the Sad Sack 
comic strip is feelings of worthlessness and degradation ("Images of Behavior," 
Aug. 16). 
</P>
<P>
 As in all historical analysis, we must look at the Zeitgeist of the time. 
There was no Jungian Angst in the minds of the World War II GIs when they 
laughed at this comic. Nor was their "inner child" trying to relate to the 
degradation of KP. 
</P>
<P>
 They actually found humor in the plight of the "Sad Sack." There was a sense 
that nonconformity was caused by laziness rather than some pre-memory 
repression. I suggest we look for some other "meaning" in Mike Kelly's 
"garbage."

A TALE OF TWO FIRESCAPES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHARON COHOON, Special to the Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Powers, Laguna Canyon resident and landscape designer, did all the right 
things with his firescaping. 
</P>
<P>
 He thinned out the toyon and lemonade berry bushes surrounding his bluff-top 
house to reduce the fuel load available to an approaching fire. He cut off the 
bottom three or four feet of branches from the remainder to eliminate fire 
ladders and keep any fire close to the ground. He chipped the prunings into 
mulch and scattered it underneath the shrubs to cool the soil and prevent 
grasses and weeds from springing up again. And he planted succulents close to 
his house to further dampen the flames. 
</P>
<P>
 It worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Powers wasn't on hand to witness it, other Canyon Acre residents said 
that the October, 1993, fire split when it encountered Powers' firescaping and 
passed around the house without touching it. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that his house ultimately did burn hasn't shaken Powers' faith one 
bit. (Sparks blew back up the canyon after the fire had passed his house and 
ignited his deck, as best he can surmise.) 
</P>
<P>
 The moral: Firescaping is only part of the solution. If Powers' deck had been 
sheathed with a fire-retardant material, he says, he is certain his house would 
have been saved. 
</P>
<P>
 He is rebuilding on the same property and using the same approach in the 
landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't landscaping that saved John and Cindalee Hall's ridge-top home last 
October; it was firefighters. The Halls didn't have a firescape at that time. 
What they had was an inherently dangerous situation -- native vegetation 
growing practically up to their back door. Fortunately they had taken the 
precaution of clearing a swath of the chaparral away shortly before fire raced 
up their slope last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 That cleared land made it easier for firefighters to defend their home. But 
the firebreak alone would not have saved it. Should there be a next time, they 
decided, their defenses would be stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 They approached local landscape architect Ann Christoph to develop a landscape 
that would be easier to defend in a fire but still be compatible with native 
vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
 Christoph's design added a stone deck and spa at the rear of the house that 
gives the Halls an attractive location in which to enjoy their splendid view. 
But it also leaves more room for firefighters to maneuver should they be 
needed. A series of narrow terraces separated by gravel pathways now contours 
the slope below the deck, bringing in non-combustible materials to help deflect 
heat from the house in case of a fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the slope is very steep (40% to 50% grade) and fire would move up it 
rapidly, Christoph selected low-growing, highly fire-retardant plants for the 
terraces. She chose a collector's assortment of unusual succulents and a few 
low-growing perennials such as Mexican evening primrose and Santa Barbara 
daisy. 
</P>
<P>
 Farther down the slope, past the non-combustible iron gate that keeps out 
deer, Christoph put in deep-rooted native shrubs to help stabilize the slope. 
Again, she chose low-growing varieties (California fuchsia, coyote bush, 
Encelia ) so that an approaching fire would find little fuel to consume. 
</P>
<P>
 To combat severe erosion occurring on one part of the slope, Christoph 
converted a gully into a water feature. She filled in the gully with rocks, 
created four concrete basins to collect the water flow, and planted Juncus , 
dwarf horsetail, and other water-loving plants around them to absorb much of 
it.

FIGHTING FIRE WITH FLORA; CREATE A DEFENSIBLE SPACE AROUNG YOUR HOME BY 
CLEARING BRUSH, THINNING VEGETATION AND EXCHANGING FLAMMABLE PLANTS FOR SLOW 
BURNERS.

 Fire has always played a part in the California landscape. Chaparral not only 
survives periodic burns -- it's done so for half a million years -- it benefits 
from them. Flames clean out dead and diseased plants and make room for fresh 
growth. And the ashes left improve the soil. The chaparral needs fire to stay 
healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, fire does not distinguish between chaparral and homes. Once 
unleashed, it can consume both with devastating speed. The message was 
delivered with a vengeance in the firestorms that swept through Laguna Beach, 
Malibu and other parts of Southern California last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 And the upcoming dry fall months bring with them the likelihood of new fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Individuals can increase the odds that a home will be left standing when the 
smoke clears by creating a defensible space around it, says Capt. Dan Young of 
the Orange County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially vulnerable are houses near chaparral. Areas that border on or 
include chaparral encompass more of Orange County than you might think -- 
places as urban as Cowan Heights and North Tustin, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the Santa Anas occur and you've got 70-m.p.h. winds and the humidity 
drops to 7% and a fire breaks out, you can't stop it," Young says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Santa Ana-driven fires burn until they run out of fuel or run into the ocean 
-- like the one in Laguna last year. Firefighters don't put those fires out. We 
can't. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best we can do is control the flanks and save individual homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Two key factors that homeowners can control affect firefighters' ability to 
save homes: space and time. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters need space in which to battle flames. If, for example, a home is 
so surrounded by dense vegetation that firefighters can't get their equipment 
anywhere near it, it is indefensible. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters also need time. If, for example, a home is surrounded by 
landscaping that slows down a fire, they have extra minutes to arrive on the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The best way to slow a fire is to deprive it of fuel. No plants are fireproof; 
even succulents will burn if the flames are hot enough. A better course is to 
reduce the total amount of plant material available to a fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that doesn't mean creating a moonscape," Young says. 
</P>
<P>
 "A buffer of healthy, well-watered, well-maintained, drought-resistant plants 
is better than bare ground. It actually improves the chances of your home 
surviving a fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "But dead vegetation is worse than nothing. It adds fuel to the flames." 
</P>
<P>
 Creating a defensible space or firescape around your home can be reduced to a 
formula: Remove, reduce and replace. Remove 
</P>
<P>
 Chaparral-fueled fires typically start when a spark ignites dry grass or 
litter, Young says. Therefore the most important thing you can do to prepare 
your landscape for the fire season is to eliminate both of these flashy fuels 
from your property now. 
</P>
<P>
 Cut tall grasses and weeds down to stubble within 100 feet of your house at 
minimum. "Throughout the entire property would be even better," Young says. 
Also remove stacks of lumber or any other combustible litter. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, prune away all dead vegetation from trees and shrubs. Areas closest to 
the house -- such as under the eaves -- are the most critical. 
</P>
<P>
 Look beyond the surface, too, Young warns. "Junipers are often green on top 
but brown and dry underneath," he says. "When fire touches them, they go up 
like torches." 
</P>
<P>
 Coyote bush (Baccharis pilularis) is another example. While often listed as a 
fire-retardant plant, it can develop into a fuel-rich tangle of dry branches 
and leaves topped by a thin fringe of green if not routinely pruned to 
encourage new growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, remove any vegetation that could act as a fire ladder, allowing 
flames to move from the ground to the crown of trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Franklin, a fire management consultant and retired Los Angeles Fire 
Department officer, explains why: 
</P>
<P>
 "A pound of chaparral is equivalent to 8,500 BTUs -- the same as a cup of 
gasoline," he says. "Pour gasoline on the ground and ignite it and it just 
smolders. But aerate it -- so that it's all pumped up with oxygen -- and it 
explodes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The same thing happens when ground fires move into the trees." 
</P>
<P>
 Trees and tall shrubs provide fires with a lot of fuel, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Keep the fire on the ground and you have two-foot flame lengths," Franklin 
says. "Let it get into the trees, though, and you're battling 80-foot ones." 
</P>
<P>
 Most firescape literature recommends removing branches from the bottom six to 
eight feet from any tree over 15 feet tall. Remove any limbs that overhang 
buildings or are within 10 feet of a chimney as well. Also prune away the lower 
three or four feet of tall shrubs. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is to create vertical space between ground-hugging plants and taller 
ones, which contain more combustible material. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove all pruned material from your property. Or, even better, suggests 
Franklin, chip it into quarter-inch pieces and use it as mulch underneath trees 
and shrubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you're doing is rearranging burnable material -- putting it on the 
ground where it does the least harm. And you're preventing grasses and weeds 
from growing back and keeping the soil cool at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chipped biomass is the ultimate fuel break." Reduce 
</P>
<P>
 Next, create horizontal as well as vertical space between plants. The idea is 
to deprive an oncoming fire of a continuous fuel supply. Islands of shrubs 
separated by stretches of mulch, gravel or low-growing ground cover are 
preferable to solid masses of hedge, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 Trees should be well separated, too. And the steeper the slope, the greater 
the desirable degree of separation. That's because fire moves faster uphill 
than down -- hot air rises -- and the steeper the slope, the swifter it climbs. 
Ten feet between the edge of one tree canopy and the next is often recommended 
for 0% to 20% slopes, and 20 feet for 20% to 40% slopes. A good rule of thumb 
for separating shrubs is at least five times the height of the shrub. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30 feet or so closest to the home should be planted the most sparsely. A 
stone or tile deck surrounded by succulents would be a far safer choice at the 
edge of a steep slope than a band of bushy foundation plants, for instance. On 
flatter parcels, an irrigated lawn would be a good choice. 
</P>
<P>
 The next 70 feet or so from the house should also be lightly planted. Many 
fire authorities recommend that plants in this band -- which acts as a 
firebreak -- be no more than 18 inches high. Natives are often a good choice, 
particularly on a slope, as their deep roots also provide soil stability. 
</P>
<P>
 If your property is larger, thin the next 50 feet or so of half its native 
vegetation, or plant widely-spaced trees and isolated islands of 
drought-tolerant shrubs. If your property is on a slope of 20% to 40%, create 
an additional 50 feet or more of defensible space by thinning the native 
vegetation by at least one-third. However be careful not to take out too many 
deep-rooted shrubs, especially on a slope, to prevent soil erosion and slope 
failure. 
</P>
<P>
 California sagebrush (Artemisia californica) , black sage (Salvia mellifera) 
and buckwheat (Eriogonum fasciculatum) are good candidates for thinning as they 
are more fire-prone than other natives. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove deadwood and fire ladders from the remaining vegetation. Michael 
Lindsey, a Laguna Beach landscape architect and native plant specialist, also 
thins out the interiors of large specimens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I prune shrubs into more tree-like shapes," he says. "It not only reduces 
total fuel load and the likelihood of shrubs acting as fire ladders, but I like 
the sculptural look it creates, too." Replace 
</P>
<P>
 Pyrophtes are plants that are high in oils and resins, making them extremely 
flammable. They can be disastrous landscaping choices in areas that interact 
with the chaparral. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you wanted to design 200 pounds of wood to burn as quickly as possible, 
you'd design a Christmas tree," Dan Young says. "Even when healthy, pines are a 
fire hazard." 
</P>
<P>
 If you retain these trees, keep them well-trimmed and with at least 10 feet of 
clear space between any building or other plant. 
</P>
<P>
 But replacing them with more fire-resistant species, such as native oaks or 
sycamores, would be a safer option. 
</P>
<P>
 Palm trees with a buildup of dead fronds beneath their crowns are highly 
flammable, too. Other common pyrophtes are cedar, cypress, juniper, spruce, 
bougainvillea and pampas grass. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have these species on your property, consider replacing them with 
plants with higher fire resistance.  
</P>
<P>
 Keep in mind that no single firescaping plan is suitable for every home. Each 
site has its own profile and problem areas. There can sometimes seem to be 
inconsistencies in expert recommendations, but differences are often the result 
of suggestions developed for different scenarios. Each situation needs to be 
evaluated individually. Final Caveat 
</P>
<P>
 If this sounds like too much work, consider this picture: 
</P>
<P>
 "Walk around your house and imagine what would happen if the sky were raining 
sparks -- because that's what happens in a firestorm," Young says. "Think about 
those sparks dropping from the sky and ask yourself what they would ignite 
first. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what you want to get rid of." More Firescape Information

 Some people talk about recycling. Some people talk about being sensitive to 
the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 But interior designer Sandy Abel and architect Dennis LaRoche are doing more 
then talking, they are doing something about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Their new venture, Living Naturally, a store that opened in late August in 
Laguna Beach, is a store that sells environmentally sensitive home furnishings 
and accessories. 
</P>
<P>
 Living Naturally, at 361 Forest Ave., came about after Abel and LaRoche 
discussed doing something to help the Earth after attending a meeting that 
focused on environmental concerns. Both are active in such organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time for everyone to start caring about the environment and this is one 
way to make it easier for consumers to do so," said Abel, who grew up in 
London, but has lived in Laguna Beach for 20 years. Abel designs some of the 
furniture in the store, in some case using recycled wood. 
</P>
<P>
 A featured item that uses natural materials is the bamboo shade lamp ($150). 
The shade is woven bamboo, and the base is made of an aluminum alloy. 
</P>
<P>
 Abel and LaRoche, who also has designed a clothing line for the store, uses 
supplies and products from environmentally sensitive vendors only. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a lot of time and effort to find and get these materials, but it's 
worth it," said Abel, adding that she and LaRoche are working on more 
furnishings and accessories. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the bed and bathroom linens and fabrics in the store are made from 
organically grown cottons. One of the signature collections, The Purists, is 
already a big seller. With natural cottons, virgin wools and linens, the 
sheets, towels and other furnishings have varied textures, weaves and colors. 
</P>
<P>
 The pillow sham ($48) has a Jacquard pattern, the bath sheet ($49) sports a 
waffle look and the jasmine-patterned sheet ($200 for twin flat) has its own 
silky, thick texture -- all achieved without chemical bleaches, dyes or 
finished. For more information, call (714) 376-2640. 'Za Hut 
</P>
<P>
 First there was the fondue pot, for casual entertaining right at the table. 
</P>
<P>
 Now there's the Pizzadom, a Swiss clay dome oven, that makes brick oven-style 
pizza on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 Using three safety paste burners and steel deflectors on a stainless steel 
base, it can make up to five four-inch pies at a time in about four minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pizzadom, which is 14 1/2 inches wide by 10 1/2 inches tall, is available 
by catalogue from Potpourri's Expressions, based in Medfield, Mass. The dome 
($225 plus shipping and handling) comes with a dough cutter and three spatulas. 
</P>
<P>
 To order from the catalogue call (800) 388-2699. Kids' True Colors 
</P>
<P>
 One place most parents allow their children to express themselves is in their 
bedrooms, and with that in mind, Plummers, which has a store in Santa Ana, has 
introduced a line of Dannish modular furniture just for the young 
</P>
<P>
 Color 4 Kids is a four-part collection of beds, chests,desks and tables in 
primary colors in which every piece fits with everything else. 
</P>
<P>
 Made of a medium-density fiber board with a non-toxic brightly painted 
surface, the pieces are easy to clean. 
</P>
<P>
 The four groupings -- First Steps, Action, School Time and Club 8 for teens -- 
can be rearranged in a multitude of ways. Each grouping is made to progress 
into the next, so pieces from the nursey can be incorporated into designs for a 
teen room. For instance, desks and book shelves from the School Time grouping 
can be added to the Club 8 bunk bed.. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices vary, depending on the pieces chosen. The two-bed bunk beds are $375; a 
book shelf is $39 and desktop $69. Plummers is at 1540 E. Warner Ave. For more 
information, call 557-0611.

ARTISANS; ALBUM QUILTS DETAIL BALTIMORE'S HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDRA SKOWRON, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the Industrial Revolution made the city hum, the women of Baltimore were 
doing something extraordinary with their needles -- creating lush fabric murals 
of elaborate design and intricate detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore album quilts have become what the Rolls-Royce is to cars and Tiffany 
is to stained glass. 
</P>
<P>
 A Baltimore album quilt made in the mid-19th Century can generally fetch 
$25,000, provided an owner is willing to part with one, said Joel Kopp, a New 
York City antiques dealer. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't get into the market that much," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A record price for a Baltimore album quilt came in 1987 when a buyer paid 
$176,000 for an 1840 quilt at Sotheby's auction house in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baltimore album quilts have become as valuable as a master painting," said 
Jennifer Goldsborough, chief curator at the Maryland Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen of the quilts, all made during album quilting's mid-19th Century 
heyday, are part of an exhibit through Nov. 27, "Lavish Legacies: Baltimore 
Album Quilts," at the historical society's museum -- which was founded just 
about the time album quilting established itself in this port city. 
</P>
<P>
 Album quilts were inspired by autograph albums popular among young ladies 
during the 1840s, filled with drawings, inscriptions, watercolors or poems. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The album quilt consists of squares resembling pages of a scrapbook. Each 
square is "appliqued," with a different design of cloth pieces sewn on. The 
squares are pieced together, framed with an intricate appliqued border, and 
quilted onto a backing. They become elaborate "albums" of flowers, birds, 
people, rich in patriotic, religious and fraternal symbols. 
</P>
<P>
 Album quilting was largely a middle-class pastime, as women sought an 
acceptable form of expression. 
</P>
<P>
 "These were made to show off what women could do with their needles," 
Goldsborough said. "They were never made to keep anybody warm." 
</P>
<P>
 Album quilt-making in Baltimore reached its zenith from 1844 to 1854, then 
waned -- perhaps due to the arrival of the sewing machine, Goldsborough said. 
Quilting also is a time-consuming task. Modern quilters estimate a single 
hand-sewn quilt requires 3,000 to 12,000 hours of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are fascinated with the style," said Eleanor Sienkiewicz, a Washington 
quilt-maker, historian and author. "When I ask people why, one thing they say 
is the recognition of excellence in the appliques, and the finest ones show 
excellent design. 
</P>
<P>
 "They also have said they like the feelings expressed by the albums. Many of 
them express, in a simple umbrella word, beneficence. They're full of warm and 
friendly thoughts and also a great deal of history." 
</P>
<P>
 Quilts in the museum's display contain blocks of festive flowers, geometric 
designs, baskets of fruit, Baltimore landmarks, animals, cornucopias, even 
historical figures of the day. One tiny figure has a waistcoat complete with 
attached lapels. 
</P>
<P>
 The intricate patterns are all the more impressive because there were no 
magazines, no pattern books on which to base design, Goldsborough said. Ideas 
came from china patterns, butter molds, cookie cutters and the folk art of 
German immigrants, among other sources. 
</P>
<P>
 It was no coincidence that the album style reached its pinnacle in Baltimore, 
a major port at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "One reason album quilts happened there, the quilt-maker had the fabric there, 
coming directly from France and England," said Nancy Tuckhorn, textile curator 
at the Daughters of the American Revolution Museum in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 "There also were many craftsmen here, for silver and for furniture, so it fits 
in with the rest of decorative arts in Baltimore at this time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The historical society has a collection of more than 200 quilts, about 32 of 
which are considered album quilts. The number is not exact, because some quilts 
are not purely in the album style, Goldsborough said. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum exhibited one set of quilts until July 10 and then replaced them 
with 16 others to protect aging fabrics from exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the first half, and I thought the others can't be as good as these," 
said Tuckhorn, "but they are, they are."

 Why would black walls in a dining room be good for dieting? Why is green the 
best color for a child's room? Why is bright red a bad choice for the kitchen?  
</P>
<P>
 For centuries, people have believed in the power of color. 
</P>
<P>
 Purple was the color of kings. Red carpets were rolled out for powerful 
people. Gold was associated with the imperial household and, therefore, good. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cultures, certain colors are thought to have specific healing or 
energizing properties, and why not? If a room painted a depressing shade can 
provoke, say, the symptoms of claustrophobia, could not the reverse be true? 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, as anyone who has ever agonized over a fistful of paint chips 
can attest, picking just the right color can be a high-stress activity. Like 
nervous shoppers trying on clothing before a three-sided mirror, insecure 
customers dithering in a paint department might seek reassurance from anyone 
who happens to be walking by. But where to turn for more reliable inspiration? 
</P>
<P>
 Some have chosen their favorite shade of nail polish or tried to match the 
color of their poodles. Comedian Joan Rivers asked a paint specialist to 
duplicate the creamy beige of her favorite stockings for the walls of her 
drawing room -- and she wasn't kidding. 
</P>
<P>
 Others turn to color gurus, image consultants who map out personal color 
charts and totally coordinate wardrobes and walls. Today, a small, brave new 
world of consumers as well as professional designers is reaching for a more 
spiritual approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Color choices are influenced by your ethnic background, your education and 
your exposure," said Kenneth X. Charbonneau, director of color marketing for 
major paint manufacturer Benjamin Moore & Co. "I would like to believe that in 
the year 2000, we will be discovering things that we never knew about the power 
of color, that there is a level of color that we have not truly broken into 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Cosmic color anyone? In a decade in which Birkenstocks and acupuncture have 
gone mainstream, and alternative medicine and holistic lifestyles are 
attracting more followers, there is interest in a more mystical view of color. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One approach is feng shui, the ancient Oriental art of placement, whose goal 
is living in harmony with one's surroundings. Part of the essence of feng shui 
is a reliance on color to create the right mood, the right physical response. 
Among its principles: 
</P>
<P>
 * Painting dining-room walls black can make eating less pleasurable and 
appetizing -- good for those trying to lose weight. 
</P>
<P>
 * Children tend to thrive in green bedrooms because green conveys vitality, a 
sense of growth and makes them blossom with a sense of new possibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't paint a kitchen bright red or the cook will always be in a 
hot-tempered, sweaty mood. 
</P>
<P>
 Feng shui (pronounced "fung shway"), which in Chinese means wind and water, is 
based on a centuries-old belief that rooms, furniture and other surroundings 
should be arranged in harmony with nature to ensure health, wealth and 
happiness. 
</P>
<P>
 The philosophy has roots in Buddhism and rural folk custom. Although most 
design fusses with the look of a place, the approach dwells in its spirit. Some 
Westerners have likened this inexact science to acupuncture for the home. 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship between spirit and color is the topic of a new book, "Living 
Color: Master Lin Yun's Guide to Feng Shui and the Art of Color," by Sarah 
Rossbach and Lin Yun, being published next week by Kodansha America. 
</P>
<P>
 Rossbach, a journalist who became a feng-shui consultant, and Lin, who met her 
in Hong Kong in 1977 while serving as her Chinese teacher and feng-shui mentor, 
have tried to distill specific color theory from the mysterious swirl of 
Oriental myth and folk legend that is feng shui. The result is a guide to color 
in your home, your food, your clothes and your garden, with a little bit of 
fortune telling thrown in for good measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the time we are very small when we wake up and open our eyes when we are 
born, the first thing we see is color," said Lin, a Beijing-born scholar now 
living in Berkeley. "Color is a deep and very important aspect of life."

TRADITIONS; HOUSEWARMINGS REALLY RAISED THE ROOF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The housewarming was once a deeply rooted tradition in rural areas. The custom 
dates back to pioneer times, when country folks were dependent on their own 
energy and ingenuity to grow, make, harvest or hunt virtually all of the 
essentials of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Housewarmings, or "house raisings" as they were sometimes called, frequently 
involved getting newlyweds off on a solid footing by giving them a home place 
in which to start their new life. 
</P>
<P>
 The new house itself was the product of communal effort. The menfolk took a 
day or two off and pooled their talents as carpenters and Jacks-of-all-trades. 
The women outdid themselves by contributing their finest culinary fare, and the 
occasion took on a festive air despite the labor involved. 
</P>
<P>
 James Price of Hayesville, N.C., recalls house raisings he was a part of while 
growing up. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parents of the bride and groom often organized the housewarming event," 
Price recalls, "and in many cases, the bride's father would have made her a new 
bed, and perhaps other furniture, to go in the home that was being raised by 
the neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 Those simple beds are now heirlooms. "In my part of the world," Price says, 
"there are beds of this kind that have been passed down through several 
generations." 
</P>
<P>
 Price says that it was also a common practice for frivolity or shivarees to be 
associated with housewarmings for the newlyweds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone would pretend to go home at day's end," he says, "but in reality, 
they just waited until the couple retired for the evening. Then they would 
serenade them with love songs, after first ringing cowbells and making lots of 
noise to get their attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a few rousing songs, those assembled at the door would demand that the 
newlyweds come out." 
</P>
<P>
 When the embarrassed couple appeared at the doorway of their new home, he 
says, "it was customary for the men to put the groom on a rail and ride him 
around the house, while the womenfolk gave the bride a similar trip in a 
wheelbarrow."

CITYSCAPES / FRANK MANNING: LAST ROUNDUP FOR SHOP THAT CLOTHED WESTERN MOVIE 
STARS; 'THEY'VE HAD SOME BEAUTIFUL STUFF IN HERE, AND THESE ARE SOME VERY, VERY 
NICE PEOPLE.'

 At the dawn of his career, Roy Rogers realized he'd need to outfit himself in 
some truly fancy duds if he was going to impress the folks who caught his act 
in a traveling rodeo. 
</P>
<P>
 The arenas were so large that Rogers, galloping around the ring on his horse, 
Trigger, just didn't stand out. 
</P>
<P>
 So he went to see Nudie, a Los Angeles tailor who was hoping to make it big 
designing outfits for movie stars. Nudie was experimenting with a revolutionary 
Western look, and he made Rogers a flashy Western suit with long fringes and 
hundreds of tiny, glittering rhinestones. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, when the spotlight found him, Rogers was transformed into a 
dazzling spectacle that made him impossible to miss.  
</P>
<P>
 The client was happy, and Nudie was well on his way to becoming the tailor to 
the Western movie stars. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nudie made John Wayne's boots. Elvis Presley wore a $10,000 gold lame suit 
designed by Nudie on the cover of his album "50,000,000 Elvis Fans Can't Be 
Wrong." The gaudy costume worn by Robert Redford in "The Electric Horseman" was 
a Nudie creation.  
</P>
<P>
 When Nudie died in 1984 at the age of 81, his widow, Bobbie, took over his 
legacy, Nudie's Rodeo Tailors Inc., a Western-wear shop that has been at the 
same location on Lankershim Boulevard in North Hollywood since 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Bobbie, 81, says she's ready to retire. On Sept. 30, she will close the 
6,600-square-foot store that has become a museum of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to dissolve it while I'm still living and not leave it to someone 
else," she said. "I don't know what they would do with it after I'm gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime customers recalled Nudie's as a genuinely glamorous part of the 
motion picture industry and bemoaned its passing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry to see it go, really," said Bob Musselwhite of Irvine, who has been 
a customer for 20 years. "They've had some beautiful stuff in here, and these 
are some very, very nice people." 
</P>
<P>
 Nudie's will not pass unnoticed. Calls for media interviews have come from 
around the nation. Friends, family and customers recall Nudie as a charismatic 
figure, outgoing and fun-loving, who made friends easily. Jamie recalled how 
Nudie would sometimes stroll the store serenading customers on his mandolin.  
</P>
<P>
 He presented a grand spectacle tooling around Los Angeles in his white, custom 
1975 El Dorado convertible, replete with steer horns mounted on the hood, a 
dashboard inlaid with 300 silver dollars and a cowboy-style rifle mounted on 
the trunk.  
</P>
<P>
 "He was very proud when he got in that car," Musselwhite said with a chuckle. 
"He thought he was the king of Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nudie, born in Russia, immigrated to Brooklyn, N.Y., when he was 11, his wife 
said. His full name was Nudie Cohn. 
</P>
<P>
 He learned to box and became a prizefighter, which offered him the opportunity 
to travel. He met Bobbie in her hometown of Mankato, Minn., and the two 
married, then moved to California in 1939. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the store was beginning to take on a vacant look as shelves began 
to empty. Bobbie was hoping to sell the photographs -- about 1,900 in all -- to 
a single collector who would put them in a museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just like he was here," she said. "He is everywhere; he is in pictures. 
This is what he created."

FLEISS HELD IN ALLEGED USE OF DRUGS; COURTS: A JUDGE ISSUES A BENCH WARRANT 
AFTER TESTS INDICATE ACCUSED MADAM USED STIMULANTS AND DEPRESSANTS, IN 
VIOLATION OF BAIL TERMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Accused Hollywood madam Heidi Fleiss was in jail Friday after drug tests 
indicated she had used stimulants and depressants in violation of her bail 
terms while awaiting trial on federal charges that she hid call-girl ring 
profits from the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. marshals arrested Fleiss at her Venice condominium Thursday evening on a 
bench warrant authorized by U.S. District Judge Consuelo B. Marshall. The judge 
acted at the recommendation of the court pretrial services officers who 
supervised the urine tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss, 28, who is also awaiting trial on separate state criminal charges that 
she procured women to engage in prostitution and possessed cocaine for sale, 
had not opposed the prosecution's request that she submit to drug tests, said 
her lawyer, Donald B. Marks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had good reason to believe that Heidi did not have a (drug) problem and 
would test successfully," said Marks. If she has developed a problem, Marks 
said, it may be because of the extraordinary stress of being a high-profile 
defendant in state and federal prosecutions. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court pretrial service officers, Fleiss tested positive for 
benzodiazepines -- a class of drugs that includes prescription medications such 
as Valium that are used to treat anxiety and sleep disorders -- on Aug. 9; 
positive for amphetamines/methamphetamines and benzodiazepines on Aug. 18 and 
Aug. 26 and positive for benzodiazepines again on Aug. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking without detailed knowledge of the Fleiss case, Charles A. Reynolds, 
the senior pharmacist at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Hospital, said that many 
abusers combine these kinds of drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Benzodiazepines, he said, are a class of central nervous system depressants 
that include Librium, Atavan, Xanax and Halcion. Amphetamines are central 
nervous system stimulants used legitimately to treat attention deficit 
disorders and narcolepsy, a condition characterized by a frequent and 
uncontrollable desire to sleep. "You can get an energetic high from the 
amphetamines and then, when you're tired of that, you can bring yourself down 
with benzodiazepines," Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pretrial services officers informed Judge Marshall of the test results in 
writing Thursday and requested an arrest warrant, which was authorized and 
executed the same day. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe the courts are not doing this as a punitive measure," said Fleiss' 
attorney, Marks. "I think the court is concerned about her welfare." 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss will spend the weekend at the federal Metropolitan Detention Center 
Downtown pending a hearing Monday afternoon on whether her $50,000 bond should 
be revoked. Marshall could free her, order her held in jail until her federal 
tax evasion trial Dec. 6, or allow her to be free if she participates in a drug 
rehabilitation program. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. attorney's office declined comment on the arrest. "The action was 
taken by the judge and pretrial services and did not involve our office and we 
cannot comment," Assistant U.S. Atty. Mark C. Holscher said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss' trial in state court, where a court spokeswoman said she has been free 
on her own recognizance, is set to begin next Monday. But Marks said it will be 
postponed at least a week because his co-counsel is out of town. It could begin 
with jury selection as early as Sept. 26 -- the same day O.J. Simpson is 
scheduled to go on trial down the hall in the Downtown Criminal Courts 
Building. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district attorney's office, Sandi 
Gibbons, said the federal arrest would not interfere with the state case. "If 
she remains in federal custody, they'll make sure she gets here," Gibbons said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss, the alleged head of a pricey call girl ring whose customers are said 
to have included many in the entertainment industry, is accused in the state 
case of supplying the services of four prostitutes in June, 1993, to undercover 
police officers posing as Japanese businessmen. The officers said they arranged 
with Fleiss for a "party" at a Beverly Hills hotel that included one of the 
prostitutes supplying an eighth of an ounce of cocaine.

DEAL REPORTEDLY NEAR IN LAPD FEUD OVER PARKS; POLICE: TENTATIVE AGREEMENT WOULD 
LET THE ASSISTANT CHIEF KEEP HIS CURRENT RANK AND RETIRE EARLY NEXT YEAR WITH 
MAXIMUM BENEFITS, OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The feud between the Los Angeles Police Department's two most powerful figures 
is on the verge of a settlement that will permit Assistant Chief Bernard C. 
Parks to retain his rank until early next year and then retire with maximum 
benefits, city officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Willie L. Williams, for his part, will be allowed to bring in a 
new second-in-command, possibly before Parks' retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 In a deal brokered by several City Council members, Parks would be able to 
leave the department without accepting a demotion that he considered 
unjustified. Williams, who ordered the demotion, would accept Parks' retirement 
and proceed with a staff reorganization that he says is crucial in speeding 
reforms in the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 A final agreement between the city and Parks is expected next week, several 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Parks nor Williams was available for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome of the battle will apparently leave the department without Parks, 
the man who has overseen 80% of its operations, and with a police chief who has 
lost his aura of political invincibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said he needed to demote Parks, and promote Chief of Staff Ronald 
Banks to second in command, in order to take more control of his department and 
push ahead with the expansion of the ranks and institution of Christopher 
Commission reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 The political dispute has exposed Williams to the first serious controversy of 
his two-year reign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's tarnished him," said an adviser to Mayor Richard Riordan, who 
asked to remain anonymous. "I think it presents a scratch in the Teflon, but 
it's also an opportunity, with the changes, for him to move and do something 
with the department." 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy erupted Monday when Williams announced that Parks would be 
demoted from his post as an assistant chief to deputy chief, with an attendant 
loss of pay of about $6,500 a year. The chief said he would replace Parks with 
Bayan Lewis, a deputy chief who has overseen the city's responses to several 
emergencies in recent years. Banks, in turn, would be promoted to the new 
position of first assistant chief, overseeing all of the LAPD's operations. 
</P>
<P>
 But several City Council members were furious that Parks, a 29-year veteran, 
had been kicked downstairs without apparent warning and while he was out of the 
country, attending a sister-city conference in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Richard Alatorre let his displeasure be known Thursday in an 
expletive-laced showdown with the chief, sources said. Council President John 
Ferraro also questioned how much control Williams really has over the 
department and suggested that the chief was ducking his own duties by 
attempting to put Banks in a new "super assistant" position. 
</P>
<P>
 And the lawyer representing the department's highest-ranking officials also 
objected, saying in a letter to the chief that he had acted in an "unlawful" 
manner by demoting Parks without proper notice. A confrontation with the 
Command Officers Assn. "will result in divisiveness and loss of public 
confidence in the department," lawyer Barry Levin wrote to Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned about the ongoing feud and the possibility that Parks would 
challenge the demotion in court, Ferraro called a meeting Thursday that 
included Williams and City Atty. James K. Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
 The group agreed that Parks should be allowed to stay on the city payroll and 
maintain his current rank of assistant chief and pay of $128,388, rather than 
take the cut if demoted to deputy chief, sources said. The group also agreed 
that Parks would not return to duty, but could take accrued vacation and 
compensatory time until February, when he will complete 30 years of service and 
be eligible for his full pension. The arrangement would result in $89,868 
annually in retirement pay for Parks, about $4,500 a year more than his pension 
would have been after the demotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams has agreed to the settlement, according to Ferraro and city 
officials, who said they are only awaiting final approval from Parks. Another 
council member, who asked to remain anonymous, said Parks had already agreed to 
the arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 But a source close to Parks, who asked not to be named, said the assistant 
chief had not reviewed the agreement and had a number of concerns, including 
that it might contain a proviso preventing him from speaking publicly about the 
police chief or new command staff. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Skip Miller, one of Parks' attorneys, declined to comment on any specifics of 
the tentative agreement. "It's moving toward a resolution and it's not 
finalized yet. That's all I'll say," said Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Department spokesman David Gascon, elevated in the recent restructuring 
from commander to deputy chief, declined comment, saying Parks' employment 
status is a confidential personnel matter. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear what impact Parks' departure will have on a department in which 
he oversaw the vast majority of operations. It had been an open secret that 
Williams and Parks -- the man he edged out two years ago for the top job -- did 
not get along. 
</P>
<P>
 Many City Council members and police commissioners have said Williams should 
be allowed to shift Parks and others without interference and should only be 
judged on the final performance of the department. 
</P>
<P>
 But other council members have said they believe that the attempted demotion 
of Parks was an effort by the police chief to deflect criticism that he has 
moved too slowly to put more police on the streets and make other changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "How many reorganizations does the guy need?" said Alatorre. "I mean, come on, 
he has been here for two years." 
</P>
<P>
 Performance reviews of the police chief and other city department heads by the 
mayor and City Council have not been conducted for two years because no money 
was available for pay raises. When the reviews resume next year, Williams and 
his reorganization plans will be scrutinized closely, several council members 
promised. 
</P>
<P>
 While Williams has acknowledged that the pace of some reforms has been slower 
than he would like, LAPD officials said they do not understand critics who say 
the police buildup is moving too slowly. Plans by the chief and mayor -- which 
are supposed to add 2,855 police to the 7,700-member force over five years -- 
are on schedule, according to several LAPD officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the roiling waters surrounding the Parks affair are calmed next week, 
more changes are expected. Williams is expected to announce a new round of 
top-level staff changes as early as Monday.

UPRISING OF HAITIAN HOPES; REFUGEES: EXILES IN L.A. ANXIOUSLY AWAIT 
DEVELOPMENTS. FOR MOST, A RETURN OF ARISTIDE WOULD PAVE THE WAY FOR THEIR OWN 
HOMECOMINGS. 
</P>

 Dieumaitre Joachim once was beaten for a song. 
</P>
<P>
 The 32-year-old singer, who remembers being roughed up and locked in a Haitian 
jail for performing at the inauguration of exiled President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide, now follows events in Haiti from a continent away -- in an apartment 
in Inglewood. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since fleeing his homeland in 1993, Joachim now dares to 
hope that he might be reunited with the family he left there, thanks to 
President Clinton's announcement that he will use military force if necessary 
to remove the nation's dictators from power. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today I'm so happy, I'm so happy for the invasion," an animated Joachim said 
Friday, a day after watching Clinton's televised speech explaining the planned 
action. "If Aristide goes back to Haiti, I can go back to Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
 Joachim is one of about 1,000 Haitian refugees in Los Angeles, most of whom 
were placed here by immigration officials in the aftermath of the 1991 coup. At 
an Inglewood apartment house where about a dozen of them gathered Friday, the 
Haitians talked excitedly in Creole and English about what an invasion might 
mean for them. 
</P>
<P>
 For most, the prospect of an invasion represents the possibility of a 
long-held dream -- to return home, to learn the fate of their families and to 
make a new start in a place that they used to call "le paradis," the paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, it is worth it," Gurges Valere, 43, said of the risks that would 
accompany a military action. Valere, a former tour guide in Haiti, fled from 
the Jean Claude Duvalier dictatorship in 1979 and returned to Haiti the day of 
the coup against Aristide, only to have to flee again. 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti "has been so miserable for so long," he said. "This has been a dream for 
Haitians for so long. This is the time. This is the time to go!" 
</P>
<P>
 At their sparsely furnished two- and three-bedroom apartments, some Haitians 
clasped photographs of the families they left, not knowing today if they are 
alive or dead. Some worried about relatives in the detention camps at 
Guantanamo Bay and about how an invasion might endanger their loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all have parents back there," said Jerry Gaspard, executive director of 
the Crenshaw-based Haitian Refugee Center. "When the bombs are falling and the 
bullets flying, nobody's safe." 
</P>
<P>
 While the refugees voiced support for returning Aristide to power, some balked 
at what it may take -- bloodshed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want a solution. I don't want to attack," said Alfred Nozil, a soft-spoken, 
sad-faced Inglewood resident who fled Haiti in 1992 and thinks strongman Raoul 
Cedras will back out at the last minute. "I've seen enough people die." 
</P>
<P>
 All of the refugees who gathered Friday said they left because they were 
terrified of remaining in a country where they could be shot for walking the 
streets at night, where women and children are murdered and where the 
authorities track and torture those who are identified as supporters of the 
democratically elected Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 Joachim said he was jailed for supporting Aristide after a videotape of the 
inauguration came to the attention of the new military regime. 
</P>
<P>
 "All Haitians love Aristide," the refugees agreed, dismissing rumors about the 
Catholic priest's mental instability as falsehoods spread by the current 
dictatorship.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Several of the Haitians are college-educated, but said they are willing and, 
indeed, eager to work even minimum-wage jobs to get by in the United States. 
While there is no central gathering place for the community outside certain 
churches, such as Inglewood's Church of God, the Haitians say they remain in 
touch with one another from Pasadena to Van Nuys, watching TV to follow the 
fate of their homeland and avidly discussing the latest developments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are hard-working people," said Alain Beliard, a medical worker who is 
doing secretarial work to make ends meet. "We're proud of ourselves. All we ask 
of the American people is to show us the way," he added, saying he would return 
to his home country to give medical assistance if needed. "Give us the tools 
and we'll do the work." 
</P>
<P>
 Valere and others said Clinton, whom they praised, should not need 
congressional approval for an invasion, noting that presidents Reagan and Bush 
did not seek congressional authorization for their invasions of Grenada and 
Panama. 
</P>
<P>
 The Haitians were also bitter when thinking back on the United States' 
previous military action, the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 "You give the oil more importance than human life?" asked Beliard, who proudly 
said he is a U.S. citizen, but added that his heart remains in Haiti. "Because 
we are black they don't give a damn!" 
</P>
<P>
 Heads nodded in agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Most did not think an invasion would be too costly, saying that the Haitian 
military is tired, outgunned and eager to give up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the Haitian people are strong enough to fight with the U.S.," 
said Elizette Cadet, 30, whose mother was slashed to death by a 
machete-wielding Haitian police officer. "They'll give up," she said of the 
military government, as her nephew Jhon Gerby ran in circles on the carpeted 
floor, waving a plastic gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who'll fight? They'll be so happy they'll drop their weapons," Jean Baptiste 
Renel, 35, said of the Haitian citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 The refugees all expected to be watching TV incessantly in the next few days 
to feed their hunger for information on the future of their homeland. "They 
want to go back to their country," Beliard said. "Where you are born, that's 
where you're soul is at. You never forget that."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; STUDENT 
ABSENCES BLAMED IN PART ON BOYCOTT DRIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly a fourth of 550 enrolled students failed to show up for class Friday at 
a Compton elementary school, and administrators attributed some of the absences 
to activists' efforts to organize a school boycott. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students on their way to McKinley Elementary School were told by adults 
that classes had been canceled, Principal Jane Harris said. The absentee rate 
normally is about 15% on Friday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the week, a group of protesters at the school had threatened to 
organize a boycott to protest the transfer of a popular instructional aide.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LONG BEACH; BANK 
ROBBERY SUSPECT SURRENDERS TO POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of three men who fled to a Long Beach house after allegedly robbing a bank 
Friday surrendered before a SWAT team stormed the home and began a room-by-room 
search for the other suspects, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other suspects were not in the house at 19th Street and Myrtle Avenue, 
said Long Beach Detective Jim Olds. 
</P>
<P>
 The unidentified man who surrendered came out of the home shortly after 4 
p.m., just over four hours after the holdup at the Sanwa Bank branch in the 
2200 block of Pacific Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 In the holdup, one of the suspects drew a pistol while the others jumped a 
counter and took $1,759.70, police said.

 But would there be a seventh-inning stretch?Don't know if you've heard, but 
the San Francisco Chamber Symphony has agreed to honor tickets for any 
remaining Giants or Oakland A's games at all of its 1995 concerts.  
</P>
<P>
 We wondered if Dodger ticket-holders might receive similar treatment from the 
L.A. Philharmonic, which opens its season here Oct 6. "It's a great idea, but 
nothing has been decided," said spokeswoman Norma Flynn. "I'll talk to our 
marketing people to see if we could work something out." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Philharmonic does let in the baseball fans, we wouldn't be surprised to 
see a new sign at its concerts: 
</P>
<P>
 "No Beach Balls Allowed." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 This town was made for walkin': Bob Fuchs of Glendora saw a crane that bore 
the slogan used by the city, which sits at the base of the San Gabriel 
Mountains. Problem was, the extension arm had been replaced, cutting off part 
of the last word of the slogan. 
</P>
<P>
 So it read: "City of Glendora . . . PRIDE OF THE FOOT." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Who's the dunce here?The other day, we quoted the San Fernando Valley 
Historical Society's publication as saying that a portion of Woodland Hills was 
once known as Moron. Actually, the society was referring to a Kern County 
settlement, the current city of Taft. Our error was all the more glaring 
inasmuch as Taft High of Woodland Hills won the national academic decathlon. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dueling signs: On the other hand, we doubt that even the scholars at Taft High 
would be able to comprehend the signs that Cathy Steinhauser snapped in 
Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Moron update: We had to find out the story on the real ex-Moron. 
</P>
<P>
 So we phoned the Taft Branch Library's Catherine Edgecomb, who quipped: "We 
prefer the pronunciation, mor-ON. It sounds better."  
</P>
<P>
 With her help, we discovered that the name apparently dates back to the early 
1900s, when a former resident of Morro Bay moved to present-day Taft (near 
Bakersfield) and opened the Morro Pool Hall. People started calling the tiny 
town Morro. But that drew protests from the city of Morro Bay. So, townsfolk 
selected Moron as a comical compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in 1909, according to Curtis Darling's "Kern County Place Names," the 
local postmaster pointed out that Moron "meant one of subnormal intelligence." 
He had the town renamed after President William Howard Taft. 
</P>
<P>
 No word on whether Taft felt honored to follow Moron. miscelLAny Surely you've 
heard of that fashionable eatery, Cafe Med, in West L.A.? It's the cafeteria at 
UCLA Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Error-conditioned? Leon Laskowski of Whittier got this flyer from an 
Oldsmobile dealer with an inadvertent plug for a competing make.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; MTA 
ASKS JUDGE TO LIFT ORDER BLOCKING FARE HIKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Transportation Authority on Friday asked U.S. District Judge 
Terry J. Hatter Jr. to lift his preliminary injunction blocking the agency from 
raising fares for the first time in six years. 
</P>
<P>
 Hatter issued the injunction Tuesday, extending a temporary restraining order 
he imposed Sept. 1, hours after the MTA's planned fare hike went into 
effect.The MTA sought to raise the basic fare from $1.10 to $1.35 and to 
eliminate general monthly passes to help bridge a $126-million operating 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA contends that Hatter's injunction is costing the agency $110,000 a day 
in lost revenue. In the request filed Friday, MTA attorneys asked that the 
judge suspend his injunction or allow the MTA to charge $1.35 while it retained 
the general monthly pass. A hearing on the request has been scheduled for 
Tuesday. Hatter has also set an Oct. 17 hearing to decide whether the 
preliminary injunction should be made permanent.

ALAMO GETS 6-YEAR TERM FOR FEDERAL TAX EVASION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in his years of trouble with the law, flamboyant evangelist 
Tony Alamo was sentenced to prison Friday, a six-year federal tax-evasion term 
that has Los Angeles prosecutors wondering whether they need to follow through 
on his scheduled child abuse trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Alamo, winding up a three-day hearing in a federal court in Memphis, asked for 
probation or some other alternative to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, you could deport me to Israel and that would be just 
fine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 59-year-old evangelist, who once ran a religious commune in Saugus and 
proselytized throughout the Los Angeles area for converts to his Holy Alamo 
Christian Church, has been at odds with the law for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a fugitive for almost three years after he disappeared in 1989 as Los 
Angeles County authorities investigated allegations that he gave telephone 
instructions to four men to strike an 11-year-old boy 140 times with a large 
paddle at the Saugus commune. 
</P>
<P>
 He was captured in July, 1991, and is still awaiting trial on the child abuse 
charges in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal judge in Memphis on Friday imposed the maximum possible prison 
term on Alamo and fined him $210,000 for his June 8 conviction on charges of 
filing a false income tax return in 1985 and failing to file tax returns for 
the next three years, Internal Revenue Service spokesman Dan Boone said. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been in jail since his conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Alamo, whose real name is Bernie Lazar Hoffman, was scheduled to return to Los 
Angeles to stand trial on state charges in the alleged beating of a young boy, 
but the federal prison sentence has local prosecutors wondering if the effort 
would be worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. John Asari said his office must now consider how much of 
the federal sentence Alamo will serve, and weigh the trauma to the alleged 
victim of putting him on the stand against the additional prison time Alamo 
might receive if he is convicted of child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point we're prepared to go to trial," Asari said. "But this gives us 
something to think of in terms of settling the case." 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing on the state case is scheduled for Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Alamo gained fame and fortune when he and his wife, Susan, founded the Holy 
Alamo Christian Church in the 1960s, taking young dropouts and drug users off 
the streets of Hollywood and providing them with food, shelter and 
anti-Catholic religious sermons. 
</P>
<P>
 Communes and church-owned businesses staffed with free labor by hundreds of 
followers in California, Arkansas and Tennessee earned millions in the 1970s 
and 1980s, particularly off the production of glitzy rhinestone-studded denim 
jackets Alamo designed, which sold in exclusive boutiques for as much as $600 
each. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS eventually stripped the Alamo Foundation of its tax-exempt status. IRS 
officials claim the Alamos shortchanged the government an estimated $10 million 
in taxes on income earned from a variety of businesses, using the tax-exempt 
Tony and Susan Alamo Foundation and later the Music Square Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Alamo argued he owed no taxes because he had no salary. He said the businesses 
financed his ministry and the church simply supported him as its spiritual 
leader. 
</P>
<P>
 During Alamo's tax-evasion trial in Memphis, the government accused him of 
controlling the private lives of his followers and said he has married eight of 
his followers since early last year, including two 15-year-old girls.

7 YOUTHS HELD IN MELEE AT LAWNDALE CAMPUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Angry over the shooting death of a young Latino man by black youths earlier 
this week, a group of 20 to 40 Latino gang members Friday attacked black male 
students at Leuzinger High School in Lawndale, officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 No students were seriously injured. About 35 sheriff's deputies and Hawthorne 
police officers descended on the campus and arrested seven youths on suspicion 
of assault and others on suspicion of failure to disperse and threatening 
school officials. They were expected to be released by this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators say the fistfights, which broke out just before 1 p.m., drew 
dozens of students, but Leuzinger students say hundreds joined the melee as 
black students rushed to defend blacks, and Latinos fought for Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Tension had been building on campus since Wednesday, when 19-year-old Alfonso 
Jacobo of Inglewood was shot during an argument with three black youths on 
Inglewood Avenue near 147th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say Jacobo, a former Leuzinger student, and two Latino friends argued 
with three black youths Wednesday, exchanging racial slurs. Members of both 
groups reportedly drew guns and opened fire. Jacobo, who was shot in the 
stomach, died at Robert F. Kennedy Medical Center in Hawthorne on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses' accounts of the shooting are contradictory and the Los Angeles 
County district attorney's office said Friday that it does not have enough 
evidence to press charges against the three black youths arrested in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 But among gang circles, talk of retaliation against black students began 
almost instantly, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leuzinger Principal Sonja Davis said student members of the school's 
conflict-resolution program alerted school officials Wednesday that Latino gang 
members wanted to punish blacks for Jacobo's death. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the warning, additional security guards had been brought in to 
augment the school's force of about 12 guards.  
</P>
<P>
 Racial problems at Leuzinger are nothing new. Three years ago, a fight between 
blacks and Latinos spilled out onto Rosecrans Avenue. And the school has had at 
least one major racial fight every year since. 
</P>

L.A. TO QUIT PAYING FOR STAFF EXERCISE CLASSES; FINANCES: HOUSING DEPARTMENT 
EMPLOYEES WILL HAVE TO COVER COST OF THEIR YOGA, STRETCHING AND AEROBICS 
SESSIONS. PROGRAMS WERE VIEWED AS MORALE AIDS. 
</P>

<P>
 Employees at the Los Angeles Housing Department can still learn to wrench 
themselves into the lotus position if they like, but starting next week they'll 
have to pay for the experience themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 City Controller Rick Tuttle said Friday that he would no longer let the city 
and taxpayers pay for lunchtime and after-work classes in yoga, stretching and 
aerobics at the Housing Department offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "The taxpayers should not be asked to support a subsidy of exercise programs 
that are only available to a selected number of city employees," Tuttle said in 
a letter to the Housing Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Department officials quickly canceled the classes, conceding they should have 
received approval from the City Council and mayor to conduct them. 
</P>
<P>
 The classes cost the city $8,745. Tuttle suggested to housing officials that 
he was more disturbed by their lack of official approval than by the thought of 
city workers attaining physical and karmic release. 
</P>
<P>
 "This letter should in no way be read as critical of the importance of (the) 
wellness program and exercise in particular," Tuttle wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the City Council and mayor had for nearly a decade approved of 
another city department contracting with a private firm to teach yoga and other 
classes. The Community Development Department spent $102,326 from 1985 until 
this year on such classes, in what was designed as a pilot project to study 
whether such "wellness" classes reduced employee sick time and increased 
productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 That department canceled its yoga and other classes with Symbiosis Inc. in 
June. A department official wrote that the classes were "professional and 
dependable" but not affordable under the city's serious budget constraints. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not clear in the city's files whether anyone decided if yoga made the 
department -- which administers social service programs and grants -- a happier 
and more productive place. 
</P>
<P>
 But Matt Callahan, director of administration for the Housing Department, said 
he believes the classes helped his department. Sessions were attended by up to 
20 employees and helped "save time and money by cutting down on sick time and 
improve employee morale," Callahan said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said morale building became particularly important a couple of years ago, 
when the Housing Department moved to new offices at 4th and Spring streets. "A 
lot of employees were unhappy about moving to the heart of Skid Row," Callahan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Lynch, a deputy city controller, said that yoga should only be taxpayer 
supported if the productivity benefits can be proved. "Otherwise, there should 
be a cost for the service," he said, "like the rest of the world has to pay." 
</P>
<P>
 Callahan agreed that the department will not stage more city-supported classes 
without official approval. But he denied that just Housing Department employees 
had benefited from the sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had people here from a lot of other departments," said Callahan, "the CDD, 
the (Community Redevelopment Agency) . . . even the controller's office."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; COUNCIL 
ACTION POSTPONED ON JOBS TRAINING GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City Council action was postponed Friday on a $3-million federal grant for a 
youth job training and placement center in South-Central Los Angeles when the 
council meeting was canceled because of a quorum. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the members who were absent were Mark Ridley-Thomas and Rita Walters, 
both of whom had previously raised questions about a federal decision to award 
a contract, without seeking bids, to the Community Build riot recovery 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The private Leimert Park-based agency, which has a limited track record in 
undertaking job training projects, plans to serve youngsters in neighborhoods 
in Ridley-Thomas' and Walters' council districts. 
</P>
<P>
 The two council members had no comment on their absence. Councilman Mike 
Hernandez, a proponent of the program, said the pair had indicated they did not 
want to vote in favor of the project but did not want to see it killed, either.

SPEAKERS URGE EXPEDITED AID FOR GAZA STRIP; MIDEAST: REP. BERMAN AND FOUNDER OF 
SOUTHLAND ISLAMIC CENTER AGREE QUICK ASSISTANCE IS VITAL, BUT DISAGREE ON THE 
FUTURE OF JERUSALEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Continuing a dialogue between Los Angeles' Jews and Palestinians, a leading 
congressional supporter of Israel and a founder of the Islamic Center of 
Southern California agreed Friday that quick financial aid to the Palestinians 
in the newly autonomous Gaza Strip is an essential next step in the Middle East 
peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in their pointed but cordial 80-minute discussion before a largely 
Muslim professional group at the Westin Bonaventure hotel, Rep. Howard Berman 
(D-Los Angeles) and Sabri El Farra, a Palestinian-born adviser to Arab American 
groups, disagreed over some issues, including the future of Jerusalem. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman said the Jewish community in Los Angeles and elsewhere in the United 
States joins with Israel in being unwilling to accept anything but "an 
undivided Jerusalem, under Israeli sovereignty." 
</P>
<P>
 But he added, "there are many ways to skin a cat" and perhaps arrangements 
could eventually be agreed upon, within that context, that are acceptable to 
both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 When El Farra responded by speaking of an open city of Jerusalem, and quipped 
that in the land of King Solomon, perhaps ways of division could be found, 
Berman held to his position. 
</P>
<P>
 Berman was more conciliatory when the moderator, Murad Siam, said the 
congressman seemed to be demanding changes in anti-Israeli covenants of the 
Palestine Liberation Organization and steps toward more PLO democracy before he 
would give economically deprived Palestinians food to eat. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," Berman said. "I support a change in the covenants and democratization in 
Gaza and Jericho. But there is no doubt in my mind that conditions in Gaza must 
be improved dramatically, without any waiting." 
</P>
<P>
 This seemed to put him closer to El Farra, who said that changes in 
anti-Israeli covenants of the PLO would require a two-thirds vote of PLO 
leaders, which could not realistically be obtained now, and that a promised 
$2.4 billion in economic aid should come first. 
</P>
<P>
 The program's host, the Southern California Professional Group, attempts, in 
Siam's words, to attract people born in Muslim countries or Christians and Jews 
with business ties to the Mideast. 
</P>
<P>
 It is only one of several groups in the Los Angeles area that have been 
organizing dialogues in recent years to try to bridge differences between what 
were described Friday as "the diasporas of the Jewish and Arab communities." 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago this week, when the initial Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement was 
signed at the White House, representatives of several of the Los Angeles groups 
participating in the dialogue celebrated by watching the ceremonies together on 
TV  
</P>
<P>
 Friday's Berman-El Farra presentation was billed as a discussion of the 
situation one year later. 
</P>
<P>
 "This debate is different," El Farra said. "We used to come here and get angry 
at one another. Now we are coming here to share views about how to bring lives 
together in the Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, he said, is that in the newly autonomous areas, unemployment is 
running 50% to 60%, garbage is not getting collected, policemen are not being 
paid and promises of the $2.4 billion in outside aid have not been kept. Berman 
acknowledged that there are problems but said: "What we've seen is nothing 
short of a miracle, a flowering on both sides of human aspirations for peace. 
Before, there was a deep and abiding pessimism. . . . Now life is becoming 
normalized, and Israelis and Palestinians are increasingly viewing each other 
as neighbors."

WOMAN SENTENCED TO DEATH IN PAID KILLINGS; COURTS: THE SO-CALLED 'GREEN WIDOW' 
HIRED A HIT MAN TO KILL HER HUSBAND, AND THEN PAID ANOTHER PERSON TO KILL THE 
MURDERER.

 Mary Ellen Samuels, portrayed during her murder trial as a cold, calculating 
"green widow," who orchestrated two murders for money, on Friday became the 
fifth woman to be sentenced to death in California since the state resumed 
imposing capital punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten members of the jury that in July had recommended Samuels' execution packed 
the courtroom's front rows as Superior Court Judge Michael R. Hoff formally 
sentenced her to die for orchestrating the murders of her husband and the hit 
man she hired to arrange her husband's killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, outside the courtroom, several jurors said the judge had validated 
their decision that Samuels, a 47-year-old grandmother, deserved to be executed 
for her crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to let people know we were sure," said juror Karen Hudson, 
explaining the jurors' presence. 
</P>
<P>
 As in all capital cases, the Samuels verdict will be reviewed automatically by 
the state Supreme Court, a process that could take at least two years. 
</P>
<P>
 All five women sentenced to death are from Southern California, three of them 
from the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels was convicted July 1 of multiple counts of murder with the special 
circumstances of soliciting murder and conspiracy to murder. 
</P>
<P>
 According to testimony, she first hired a reputed drug dealer to murder her 
40-year-old husband, Robert Samuels, a motion picture camera assistant who had 
decided to divorce her after a three-year marital separation and several 
unsuccessful reconciliation attempts. He was bludgeoned and shot to death in 
his Northridge home in December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Janice Maurizi had argued that Samuels plotted to kill her 
husband for two years, after realizing he was "worth more to her dead than 
alive." Samuels would have received a $30,000 settlement in the divorce, the 
prosecutor said, but as a widow she inherited $500,000 in real estate, business 
and insurance proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels also was found guilty of funneling $5,000 to two other men to kill the 
original contract killer, 27-year-old James Bernstein, to prevent him from 
cooperating with police. Bernstein, who was engaged to marry Samuels' daughter 
Nicole, was strangled in June, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 During the year between her husband's death and her arrest, Samuels inherited 
and spent more than $500,000 on a Porsche, a Cancun condominium, vacations, fur 
coats, rented limousines, nightclub hopping and custom outfits from a trendy 
Melrose store called Trashy Lingerie. 
</P>
<P>
 Her lavish spending habits inspired police and prosecutors to dub Samuels "the 
green widow." 
</P>
<P>
 The trial also included testimony about lurid love letters, male strippers, 
mother-daughter cheesecake photos, cocaine sniffing, botched murder schemes and 
a talking parrot that cursed the police. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most eye-catching evidence: a photograph taken of Samuels by a lover 
within months of the murders, showing her on a hotel bed, nude and smiling, her 
body covered with about $20,000 in $100 bills.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / PROPOSITION 187; VALLEY BUSINESS GROUPS BACK MEASURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM ENRIQUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After an emotionally charged debate that continued for months, representatives 
of the San Fernando Valley's 21 chambers of commerce voted this week to support 
Proposition 187 -- the controversial state initiative seeking to restrict 
health and education benefits for illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber members, representing more than 8,500 mostly small and medium-size 
Valley businesses, had been split over support of the measure because they 
disagreed whether Proposition 187 would do what proponents say it will. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamber representatives said they agreed that illegal immigration has become a 
costly local problem that is being ignored by government decision-makers. But 
they differed on how to approach the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are saying, 'I don't like this Third World takeover,' " said Guy 
Weddington McCreary, a North Hollywood Chamber of Commerce member favoring the 
initiative. "It is literally an invasion and very upsetting." 
</P>
<P>
 But others countered that the Valley's lingering economic troubles, as well as 
demographic and other social changes, are not likely to be reversed with the 
passage of Proposition 187. They cite additional costs and responsibilities the 
measure would create. Besides restricting government services, it would also 
require local school and medical authorities to report suspected illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't feel that requiring medical and educational personnel to be INS 
cops was appropriate," said James Stewart, member of the Mid-San Fernando 
Valley Chamber of Commerce, which voted against support of Proposition 187. "We 
know we have an illegal immigration problem. But the solution is to do a better 
job at the border. This doesn't do anything besides create more bureaucracy." 
</P>
<P>
 The vote Wednesday supporting the initiative by the San Fernando Valley's 
United Chambers of Commerce was 15 to 10. (Some of the larger chamber groups 
get more than one vote). It was largely symbolic, but chamber members say the 
debate has been among the most emotional in recent memory. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of people got really hot about it and that's not real common," 
Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chamber members said they did not believe support of the measure would cost 
them customers because of its broad support. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Valley business owners who support the measure say it has caught fire 
among longtime residents who are unhappy with growing numbers of lower-income 
residents, many of them Latinos, now living in the sprawling Los Angeles suburb 
that was once nearly all-white and predominantly middle class. 
</P>
<P>
 McCreary -- who says his family moved to North Hollywood 107 years ago and was 
instrumental in its development -- said support for the measure is largely 
based on economics. 
</P>
<P>
 He said many taxpayers fear paying increasingly larger shares of their income 
to support the families of illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 But the measure is about more than money, McCreary said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people move in here, they aren't being assimilated. . . ." said 
McCreary, who works as a property manager. "We've got to get a handle on it, or 
else." 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of talk is fueling a lot of support for the measure, said Scott 
Macdonald, spokesman for Taxpayers Against 187. "But the 187 doesn't solve the 
problem. It does nothing at the border," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodland Hills Chamber of Commerce -- the Valley's largest with 1,000 
members -- agrees. They voted to oppose Proposition 187, saying it would do 
little to reduce illegal immigration and, with restrictions on medical care, 
could makes matter worse. Debate over support of the measure was also split, 
but members agreed that illegal immigration is a problem that government has 
been unable to fix. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodland Hills Chamber of Commerce is the largest entity within the 
Valley's united chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 Results of a statewide Times Poll released earlier this week show that 
Proposition 187 is supported by virtually all groups, including Latino voters. 
Among all registered voters, the measure is favored 62% to 28%, an overwhelming 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Area Chamber of Commerce is scheduled to discuss support of 
the initiative next week.

AL MARTINEZ: WHEN SPEECH COUNTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When I telephoned Shellie Bader at Clear Speech Inc., her secretary thought I 
was saying my name was Omar Teemus. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, people think I'm saying Elmer Teenez, which is closer to my real name 
than Omar Teemus, but as I've gotten older my tendency to mumble has increased. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can we do for you, Omar?" the secretary asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "MY NAME ISN'T OMAR AND I WANT TO TALK TO SHELLIE BADER!" 
</P>
<P>
 I probably shouldn't have hollered, but making oneself clear is the way it 
ought to be. Americans aren't supposed to mumble. 
</P>
<P>
 I learned that later from Bader herself, who explained that in this country we 
usually talk with our lips apart and move our mouths a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 While people from, say, the Philippines tend to speak softly and not project, 
we jump into your face and demand to know WHAT'S GOING ON AROUND HERE and DON'T 
YOU PEOPLE HAVE NO CHEESEBURGERS IN THIS PLACE! 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not sure why I mumble. Bader suggested that Native Americans tend to 
mumble more than, well, Later Americans, and perhaps I have some Native 
American genes in me. 
</P>
<P>
 I was going to point out that they didn't seem to be mumbling when they sent 
Custer and his gang to cavalry hell at Little Bighorn, but I was at Clear 
Speech TO LEARN ABOUT PROJECTING AND SPEAKING CLEARLY, not to argue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This all began one day when I was at a restaurant in Woodland Hills called 
Khara Indian Oven. The waiter, who was from New Delhi, began asking me 
questions, but his accent was so thick I couldn't understand him. 
</P>
<P>
 I assumed he was asking for my order, so I said, "I want the tandoori 
chicken." But because I mumble, he couldn't understand me.  
</P>
<P>
 We were in limbo until my wife, Cinelli, stepped in and determined that he was 
asking if I knew who the secretary of state was. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the hell's that got to do with my chicken?" I said. 
</P>
<P>
 She faced the waiter. "HE WANTS TO KNOW WHAT THE HELL THAT HAS TO DO. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "Never mind," I said, jabbing my finger at the menu, "just bring me that and 
that!" 
</P>
<P>
 We learned later that the waiter amuses himself by testing Americans on their 
knowledge. A degree in government, while not required, is advisable for anyone 
who anticipates eating there. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident got me thinking about accents. I began noticing how many 
merchants in the city have them. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for this, according to my research, is that 90 languages are spoken 
by students in L.A.'s school district. It's their fathers, mothers and uncles 
who own or are working at the places I patronize. 
</P>
<P>
 It was during my research that I came across Shellie Bader, who specializes in 
accent reduction. I went to her wanting to know if there was any secret to 
understanding people from other countries who, although they speak English, 
speak it like the waiter at Khara Indian Oven. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bader took time to explain the importance of things like upward pitch glides 
and linkage junctions. She has a master's degree in communicative disorders and 
has been clearing up accents for a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, her expertise does not include understanding accents, although 
as we spoke, I had the feeling she was trying to teach me to speak more 
clearly. That's when I learned that I ought to talk with my lips a quarter of 
an inch apart, like a real American. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching his show, I've noticed that Seinfeld always has his mouth open in a 
kind of expectant smile, which no doubt helps him speak clearly. That wouldn't 
work for me because I rarely smile, though I have been practicing keeping my 
lips apart in preparation for saying something. Cinelli thinks it makes me look 
demented. 
</P>
<P>
 Clear speech isn't easy. Bader points out there are 46 sounds in the English 
language. Mastering them is a chore because the same letter often has different 
sounds. She offered as an example the sentence, "She used a large plaid cloth 
to clean the filthy bathtub." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to noticing the different vowel sounds, students are expected to 
say it like an American, clear and strong and brave. CLEAN THE FILTHY BATHTUB, 
DAMN IT, OR WE'LL BOMB YOU INTO THE CARIBBEAN! Like that. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Bader's biggest challenges was to help a woman shake her Valley Girl 
accent. Saying "fer shure" in a nasally tone while hanging out at a mall loses 
its allure when you're past 40. 
</P>
<P>
 It is for similar reasons that I want to overcome my tendency to mumble. A 
grown man ought to be able to communicate. SO GET YOURSELF DOWN TO THE KHARA 
AND SAY THE SECRETARY OF STATE IS WARREN CHRISTOPHER AND YOU'D LIKE THE 
TANDOORI CHICKEN, BY GOD! 
</P>
<P>
 Tell 'em Omar sent you.

GROUP GIVES FOOD TO 4,000 ON SKID ROW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 4,000 hungry people took home crates of food and supplies when 
televangelist Pat Robertson's Operation Blessing rumbled into Los Angeles' Skid 
Row this week. 
</P>
<P>
 With Downtown's skyscrapers as a backdrop, volunteers Wednesday loaded the 
boxes from eight tractor-trailers into the hands of hungry residents of the 
blighted community. 
</P>
<P>
 Many said they normally get their daily bread from area missions or food 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess there are some good people in the world," said Willard Carson, 45, 
walking away from the giveaway with a box of rice, beans, iced tea, chocolate 
bars and toiletries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not working and I need this food," said a woman who declined to give her 
name. "God bless the one that brings it and shares it too." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the food distribution began, those attending listened patiently as 
Robertson called on them to let God "clean up all your sins and give you a 
brand new life." 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson, wearing a denim shirt and blue jeans, told the crowd that God "has 
got power over crack cocaine, he's got power over alcoholism, over broken 
homes, sickness -- whatever oppresses you and keeps you down." 
</P>
<P>
 Operation Blessing spokesman Mr. T, of the 1980s television series "The A 
Team," led a prayer with a similar message. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, he had moved down a line of people awaiting food, urging them to pray 
and sprinkling his message with such advice as, "Love is the greatest weapon." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, the poverty he has seen during the food drive has driven him to 
tears, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles stop was part of a three-month, 17-city effort to heighten 
awareness about hunger in America, said Julie Fairchild, a spokeswoman for 
Operation Blessing. Farms and canneries donate the food that otherwise would 
rot or be thrown out because it is undersized or mislabeled, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 400,000 pounds of food will be distributed in Southern California, she 
said. In all, the Hunger Strike Force Convoy will give away 3.4 million pounds 
of food nationally, she said.

NATIONAL BAPTIST LEADER SETS AGENDA; LEADERSHIP: THE REV. HENRY J. LYONS, 
ELECTED PRESIDENT OF LARGEST U.S. BLACK CHURCH, SAYS AFRICAN AMERICANS NEED TO 
MAKE THEMSELVES FELT ECONOMICALLY AND POLITICALLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A politically active pastor who says the black church should be a force to be 
reckoned with in Washington was elected to lead the National Baptist Convention 
U.S.A. Inc. into the third millennium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Henry J. Lyons, who headed the Rev. Jesse Jackson's 1984 and 1988 
presidential campaigns in Florida, was elected recently to a five-year term as 
president of the nation's largest black church. 
</P>
<P>
 At a victory celebration, Lyons vowed to work to increase the political and 
economic power of blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our presence must be felt, must be made known and our counsel sought," Lyons 
said. "We've got to let it be known we will not be taken for granted." 
</P>
<P>
 Lyons, 52, a convention vice president and pastor of Bethel Metropolitan 
Baptist Church in St. Petersburg, received 3,545 votes to win the five-man 
race. The Rev. W. Franklyn Richardson, a pastor in the Westchester County, 
N.Y., town of Mt. Vernon and the convention's longtime general secretary, 
finished second with 3,014 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. William J. Shaw, a Philadelphia pastor who is director of the 
ministers' division of the National Congress of Christian Education, finished 
third with 2,311 votes, while the Rev. C.A.W. Clark, a convention vice 
president and nationally known revival leader from Dallas, was fourth with 
1,344 votes. A write-in candidate, the Rev. Jasper W. Williams of Atlanta, 
received 141 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 After the votes were announced, Richardson, Shaw and Clark promised to work 
with Lyons, who asked for their ideas in shaping a new Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyons succeeds the Rev. T. J. Jemison, the Louisiana pastor who was prohibited 
from seeking reelection after 12 years in office. 
</P>
<P>
 The election of the convention's third president in 42 years comes at a 
critical juncture for black churches that are under increasing pressure to deal 
more aggressively with AIDS, violence, poverty and the dissolution of family 
life.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1961, the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and some other civil rights leaders 
left the convention to help form the Progressive National Baptist Convention 
after their candidate lost a turbulent bid for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 "America continues to look to this group for leadership . . . and we've never 
offered them anything," Lyons said. "We want to turn that whole image around." 
</P>
<P>
 With an estimated 8 million members in 33,000 churches, the convention says it 
is the world's largest black organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyons says that when he was 11 his pastor told him he would one day be 
president of the National Baptist Convention U.S.A. Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1966, during his seminary training at Morehouse School of Religion in 
Atlanta, "God quite emphatically gave me my marching orders." 
</P>
<P>
 Before he was married 23 years ago, he asked his wife if she could live with 
the rigors of being married to the head of the nation's largest black church. 
And prior to assuming the pulpit at Bethel Metropolitan Baptist Church in St. 
Petersburg, Fla., he gave his congregation the same warning about his 
intentions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So in a sense his successful bid to become the convention's third president in 
the last 42 years was a prophecy fulfilled. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes the hard part. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyons takes over the convention presidency at a time when many black colleges 
are in trouble, black youths are turning to Islam in significant numbers, and 
drugs, crime and violence have reached a crisis stage in many communities where 
the convention's 33,000 churches are located. 
</P>
<P>
 "I come to this moment with a lot of humility," he said. "I really do have a 
sense of service." 
</P>
<P>
 Having received just over a third of the total vote, the first thing Lyons did 
after his victory was announced was pray for unity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a minute for reprisal," Lyons said in a later interview. "We've 
got to hit the ground running." 
</P>
<P>
 In restructuring the convention, the Florida pastor has said he wants to 
expand the Home Mission Board to address issues such as AIDS, economic 
discrimination and other issues of importance to black Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 On the political front, Lyons said the convention will be a more active force 
in Washington, working closely with the President and groups such as the 
Congressional Black Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to let it be known we will not be taken for granted," Lyons said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyons said he would like to see the convention take the lead in helping to 
develop mentoring programs that pair adult church members with youths in the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mean some football player. I mean some John Doe who gets up to go to 
work every morning," Lyons said. "We have to get to our children. That's our 
first priority." 
</P>
<P>
 Another priority promised by Lyons is to increase financial aid to struggling 
black schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our black colleges are closing at an alarming rate," Lyons said. "We've got 
to get in and bail those schools out." 
</P>
<P>
 But to finance his proposals and to make the church a major player on the 
American religious scene, Lyons says, the convention is going to have to reach 
a lot deeper into the tills of its 33,000 churches. 
</P>
<P>
 To replace the current system in which churches pay a set fee ranging from 
$100 for smaller churches to $1,200 for the largest churches to register with 
the convention, Lyons is proposing a system more like the Southern Baptist 
Convention, in which churches give a percentage of income to a national 
cooperative program. 
</P>
<P>
 The money will come, Lyons said, as the convention also offers its members 
regular, audited financial reports that show how the money is being spent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Financial responsibility and integrity will be a hallmark of the Lyons' 
Administration," said the Rev. Roscoe D. Cooper Jr. of Richmond, Va., the new 
general secretary of the convention.

RELIGIOUS RIGHT LACKS WIDE APPEAL, POLL SAYS; POLITICS: LIBERAL GROUP FUNDS A 
SURVEY THAT FINDS MOST VOTERS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT VALUES. BUT MANY ARE 
SUSPICIOUS OF OFFICEHOLDERS WHO COME ON TOO STRONG ABOUT RELIGION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 American voters may be concerned about moral values, but they are not 
necessarily drawn to the agenda of activist religious conservatives, a liberal 
policy group said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans of all political stripes support and want to talk about strong 
families, the role of religion in our society, and values like personal 
responsibility," said Arthur Kropp, president of People For the American Way. 
"But they don't respect politicians who would go a step further and try to turn 
our political debates into a religious or culture war." 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington group released the results of a poll by Peter D. Hart Research 
Associates on a number of volatile social issues that appear to polarize the 
nation into feuding religious camps. 
</P>
<P>
 Both liberals and conservatives could take comfort in the poll, which surveyed 
1,002 voters by telephone between Aug. 1 and 6. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, 74% of those polled said they would support a political candidate 
who "put top priority on returning to traditional moral values," the rhetorical 
touchstone of religious conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 And by 51% to 34%, those polled said that the most serious problems in society 
stem mainly from a decline in moral values, rather than from economic and 
financial pressures on the family, another central argument of religious 
conservatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor did people seem to fear that the religious right was a threat. Sixty-one 
percent said critics of the right were raising exaggerated fears; only 28% 
described the influence of conservative religious groups as a serious problem. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, 53% of those questioned described "people trying to 
use government to impose their own religious viewpoints on others" as a very 
serious or fairly serious problem for the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 About 80% said people in government "should not let their private religious 
views be the most important consideration in public policy decisions." 
Eighty-nine percent said political leaders should not question the religious 
faith of people with whom they disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 School prayer provides a classic case of Americans' ability to make fine 
distinctions, according to the survey. 
</P>
<P>
 As polls since the 1960s have shown, Americans support politicians who back 
laws to allow organized prayer in public schools -- in this instance by a 
53%-22% margin. 
</P>
<P>
 But when those same supporters are asked about the consequences of that policy 
-- having school board officials or administrators involved in selecting or 
approving prayers to be used -- 52% oppose and 35% support praying. 
</P>
<P>
 On other issues that have emerged in the culture war, which some critics say 
began with the sexual revolution of the 1960s, 60% said they would be more 
inclined to support a political candidate who believes that abortion decisions 
should be left up to the woman with few legal restrictions. Sixty-five percent 
said they would have serious concerns about efforts to make nearly all 
abortions illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, 71% of those polled viewed favorably candidates who support 
comprehensive sex education that begins with abstinence but also includes 
information on birth control and disease prevention. Two-thirds said 
conservative opposition to teaching public school students about birth control 
caused them serious concern. 
</P>
<P>
 And by a margin of 66%-28%, those polled said they would prefer to see a focus 
on improving public schools rather than instituting a voucher program for 
private and religious education.

 More than 200 teen-age members of church youth groups from around Southern 
California are expected at "Planting the Seeds," the first youth conference 
sponsored by the North American Conference on Christianity and Ecology, next 
Saturday in Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
 The interdenominational event for junior and senior high students will feature 
speakers from Earth Day USA and the Tree Musketeers, a youth-run environmental 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Yvonne Dever, a coordinator of the conference, said, "The environment and 
ecology are major concerns of young people. What we're trying to accomplish is 
to give them a background as to why as Christians they should be involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten talks and workshops will be offered between 9 a.m. and 4 p.m., including 
one on the "Biblical Roots of Caring for Creation," led by the Rev. William 
Wood, associate pastor of the First Presbyterian Church of Oceanside, where the 
conference will be held. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood, who holds a doctorate in chemistry as well as a master of divinity 
degree from Fuller Theological Seminary, said, "The Bible refers to mankind's 
'dominion.' It means that God has entrusted us with both freedom and the 
responsibility to care for creation." 
</P>
<P>
 Other topics include environmental justice and environmental racism, 
eco-friendly career options and volunteer opportunities in Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Marino, who is helping to coordinate the conference, said that the North 
American Conference on Christianity and Ecology is an all-volunteer 
organization founded in 1986 by mainline Christian denominations. "I would say 
about 25 Southern California churches are involved," she said. "This is the 
national organization's first-ever conference for youth. If we're successful, I 
want to put together a team of teen-agers to plan another conference in the 
next year or two." 
</P>
<P>
 Registration is $15 per church plus $5 per teen-ager. For information, phone 
Pam Marino at (714) 786-0969.

CASE OF VANISHED COLLEGE STUDENT REVEALED AS HOAX; CRIME: 20-YEAR-OLD PLACENTIA 
WOMAN FEARED KIDNAPED SHOWS UP AT POLICE STATION WITH BOYFRIEND. HE IS CHARGED. 
FATHER COLLAPSES.

<P>
 A 20-year-old Placentia woman missing since Sept. 6 surfaced unharmed at the 
city's police station Friday, prompting a chaotic, unhappy family reunion at 
which she announced plans to marry a boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahtab Ghalandar's father collapsed after being reunited with his daughter and 
was rushed to Placentia-Linda Community Hospital, where he was treated for an 
unspecified ailment and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Ghalandar, whose disappearance sparked a highly publicized search, told police 
that she spent the last 10 days in Anaheim and San Bernardino with relatives of 
boyfriend Ruben Torres, 23, who accompanied her to the police station Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been doing this for close to 11 years. I've seen a lot of amazing 
emotionally charged scenes. But this was close to the top," Detective Corinne 
Loomis said of the dramatic end to the search for Ghalandar. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really incredible," she said. "It was not a happy reunion. . . . It 
was a really ugly scene." 
</P>
<P>
 Ghalandar adamantly refused to return home to her parents and later admitted 
to police that she had telephoned her family as part of the attempt to make 
them believe she was being held against her will. 
</P>
<P>
 The day's events began to unfold at 8:25 a.m., when Ghalandar and Torres, both 
students at Fullerton College, unexpectedly appeared at the police reception 
area and informed detectives that she was safe and had not been kidnaped. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were holding hands and acting like they were in love," said Loomis, 
adding that investigators suspect the pair came forward out of fear that 
Ghalandar would be recognized because of the media attention the case has 
generated. 
</P>
<P>
 Ghalandar told police that she and Torres hatched a plot to help her run away 
from her parents in the Fullerton College cafeteria on the afternoon of her 
disappearance, Loomis said. Police believe Ghalandar wanted to leave her 
parents so she could spend more time with Torres. 
</P>
<P>
 Ghalandar's family reported her missing after she failed to return home from 
classes Sept. 6. The family, who immigrated to the United States from Iran 
about a year ago, told police they feared for Ghalandar's safety because she 
speaks little English. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres originally told detectives he dropped Ghalandar at a bus stop across 
from the college on Chapman Avenue on Sept. 6 after their 
English-as-a-second-language class ended at 2 p.m. Based on his information, 
detectives theorized that she had been abducted from there. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, Loomis said, Ghalandar and Torres left the college together and 
had been living for the last 10 days with a succession of Torres' relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers, friends, family members and Fullerton College classmates 
distributed more than 400 missing-person flyers over the last 10 days in an 
attempt to find Ghalandar. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahtab Ghalandar admitted to police Friday that she placed a call to her 
family's apartment Tuesday to make them think that she had been kidnaped, 
Loomis said. During the phone call, which lasted only a few seconds, Ghalandar 
told her mother that she was in good health but was being prevented from coming 
home, Loomis said. She then abruptly hung up the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Ghalandar told police she made the call from a pay phone in Fullerton to avoid 
having it traced, Loomis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She seemed to be unconcerned about the fear this all brought to her family," 
Loomis said. "It was my impression that she was unconcerned about the number of 
hours people spent looking for her." 
</P>
<P>
 Torres was cited for suspicion of obstructing a police investigation, a 
misdemeanor charge. He was released after receiving an Oct. 17 court date. 
</P>
<P>
 "He lied to us from the beginning," Loomis said. "We investigated this for 169 
man-hours and spent $5,000 when a simple phone call and the truth would have 
sufficed." 
</P>
<P>
 Ghalandar and Torres told detectives Friday that they planned to get married 
today Ghalandar refused to go home to her parents, so police told family 
members to come to the station, Loomis said. 
</P>
<P>
 When they arrived, "she changed her story completely," Loomis said. "She said 
she was abducted. She had time to think about her story and tried to get 
sympathy" from the family. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Ghalandar admitted to her mother and father, that she had run 
away, but refused to go home, Loomis said. As she was about to leave with 
Torres, her father, Mohammed Ghalandar, collapsed in the police station, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looked ashen. His eyes were semi-closed and he was very still," Loomis 
said. " He looked like he was in distress." 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics rushed to Mohammed Ghalandar's aid. When an ambulance arrived, 
Ghalandar rode with her father to the hospital, where he was treated and 
released. A hospital spokeswoman refused to discuss the nature of his illness 
or say what kind of treatment he received. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pam Nikmanesh, Ghalandar's cousin, said the stress of the reunion caused 
the father's blood pressure to skyrocket. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's fine now. He's back home resting," Nikmanesh said. "He didn't have a 
heart attack. He's doing great now. The family is trying to put it all behind 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Nikmanesh said that Mahtab Ghalandar is back home with her parents. Nikmanesh 
was not sure whether her cousin planned to follow through with her marriage 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the case's bizarre end, both police and Fullerton College officials 
expressed relief that Ghalandar was found safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes us feel good. There were a lot of anxious moments," said Fullerton 
College spokesman Al Busch. "We're glad . . . it's over." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are always happy when the situation ends where she is safe and well," 
Loomis said.

CANDIDATE TERRIFIED BY FIREBOMB; CRIME: MOLOTOV COCKTAIL DOES NOT EXPLODE, BUT 
FOLLOWS BY A WEEK SHOTS INTO HOME OF LA HABRA ACTIVIST DOROTHY RUSH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Molotov cocktail crashed through the bedroom window of a La Habra City 
Council candidate early Friday in an apparent attempt to set fire to her house 
in the Grace/Pacific neighborhood, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The firebomb did not explode but was still lit when authorities found it on 
Dorothy Rush's bed shortly after 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Rush, 60, was not in the room when the device -- a beer bottle filled with 
gasoline and plugged with a cloth -- crashed through her window and landed on 
her bed. She and her husband, Larry, 62, were uninjured. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident is the second in as many weeks in which unidentified attackers 
have struck Rush's house, La Habra Police Officer Cindy Knapp said. The home 
was also the target of two separate attacks earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone's trying to kill me," said Rush, a retired dress maker who gained 
notoriety over the past several years because of her public fight to get rid of 
gangs and blight in parts of the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, police said someone sprayed her Grace Avenue home with gunfire, 
puncturing walls and knocking out windows. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm scared and I don't know why this is happening. If they don't want me to 
run for the council, they're defeating their purpose because they're just 
giving me publicity," said Rush, who has been prodding the city for years to 
enact strict parking and property maintenance laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Knapp said detectives believe the two recent incidents are related but don't 
know if they involve gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 No arrests have been made in either case, Lt. John Buchholz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police found 9-millimeter bullet slugs inside Rush's home after the Sept. 1 
shooting, which occurred about 6:10 a.m. Neighbors said they saw a man fire at 
the home while riding in the bed of a faded red pickup truck with a white 
camper shell, Buchholz said. 
</P>
<P>
 That wasn't the first time Rush's home was targeted in a drive-by shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunshots fired in February shattered a living room window. The attackers also 
scribbled the name of a neighborhood gang on the front of her house, Rush said. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, cinder blocks were hurled into Rush's bedroom and living room 
windows, one hitting her on the back as she slept, another grazing cat and a 
third shattering a dresser mirror. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Rush began a Neighborhood Watch program, graffiti usually appears on her 
driveway after each monthly meeting of the group. She said she organized area 
residents in an effort to persuade police to step up patrols in her area. 
</P>
<P>
 Rush also founded the Grace/Pacific Community Assn. last year to get tenants 
to maintain their properties and get landlords to evict those who do not. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those neighbors have accused her of meddling and blamed her for their 
evictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because she's active in the community, she has, unfortunately, made some 
people unhappy," Knapp said. 
</P>
<P>
 Knapp said police patrols have been stepped up in Rush's Grace/Pacific 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Police urge anyone with information to telephone Detectives Mel Ruiz or Jose 
Quirarte at (310) 905-9683 or leave word on the department's anonymous tip 
line: (310) 905-9611. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody wants me out of here, but I'm not going anywhere," Rush said. "For 
some reason, they really hate me and all I'm doing is trying to clean up the 
neighborhood. . . . It's no fun, but if (her attackers) really got a gripe, 
tell me what it is and maybe there's something we can work out."

MARKETABLE SKILLS TESTED IN QUEST TO BAG A VICTORY; CONTEST: GROCERY BAGGERS 
COMPETE ON SPEED, TECHNIQUE AND STYLE IN ANAHEIM. STATE CHAMPION WILL BE NAMED 
TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Friday was the day James Bayly had been waiting for. 
</P>
<P>
 The 18-year-old grocery bagger for Ralphs in Villa Park had been training for 
weeks and felt primed to do well in the California Grocers Assn.'s Bag-Off 
Contest. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Bayly of Orange stepped up to the stage and looked at the 44 items he 
was supposed to stuff into paper bags as quickly and neatly as possible, he 
felt a sudden wave of panic. 
</P>
<P>
 The boxes of cereal and crackers, cans of soup, toothpaste, toilet paper and 
other items were all mixed up. 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out that organizers of the contest at the Anaheim Convention Center 
had purposely arranged the items differently from the diagram they had earlier 
provided the 17 state finalists to study. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really threw me," Bayly said of the last-minute switch. "But I just used 
common sense and that got me through. Common sense tells you not to put cans on 
top of bread." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the switch didn't hurt the Cal State Fullerton student's chances. 
He was among the nine contestants who made it through Friday's preliminary 
round and will compete to become state champion when the contest resumes today. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way most of them had studied the diagram, they could have bagged those 
groceries in their sleep," said event coordinator Vicki Berends. "We changed 
the items around slightly but that made it more challenging. It slowed things 
down, but this helps them prepare for the nationals." 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of the final will be awarded $1,000 and will go on to compete in 
February national bag-off held in Las Vegas. Previous winners have appeared on 
David Letterman's network variety show. 
</P>
<P>
 The contestants are judged in speed, bag-building technique, number of bags 
used, weight distribution, style, attitude and appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's event resembled a rowdy pep rally, with each contestant being cheered 
wildly by co-workers, friends and relatives. Many in the audience blew horns 
and waved pompons and signs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of the pandemonium was a Joan Rivers look-alike, Dee Dee Hanson, 
who kept the proceedings moving at a swift pace between rounds, interviewing 
bashful contestants and telling supermarket-related jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 The group supporting 17-year-old David Davey, representing Hughes market in 
Los Angeles, was the largest cheering section. They waved large signs bearing 
the likeness of their contestant. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the contest, Davey admitted that the chaos had him feeling a little 
jittery but he said, "I know I'm going to win." 
</P>
<P>
 And true to his word, Davey was among the top nine finishers, despite some 
dissatisfaction with his performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did my best but they switched things around," he said. "I think I could 
have done better." 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Zepeda, a 19-year-old bagger at the Alpha Beta store in Indio, didn't 
make it to the final round, but she was proud to have been one of only three 
women to qualify for the state competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Girls can bag as good as guys," Zepeda said. "I always bag fast. It's just 
the way I am. I'm very active and like to go fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many of her colleagues, Zepeda said she enjoys her job because she gets 
to meet a lot of people, even though some of them aren't always in the best of 
moods. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you work in the morning, people are very friendly," she said. "But at 
night, they've had a long day, and they can be real grouchy." 
</P>
<P>
 Contestant Doug Favelo, from Reedley, was among the winners and wondered what 
his customers would think if he packed their groceries as fast as he packed on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would be fun to try it," he said. "But I think they might be 
frightened off."

TWO ARRESTED IN FATAL SHOOTING NEAR RESTAURANT 
</P>

 Police arrested two men Friday in connection with the fatal shooting of a 
44-year-old man outside a McDonald's restaurant on Beach Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Vernon Windell Flournoy, 44, was shot outside the fast-food restaurant just 
after 7:30 p.m. Thursday after encountering two men in the 20300 block of Beach 
Boulevard, according to Officer Mike Corcoran. 
</P>
<P>
 Shot with a small-caliber handgun, the Huntington Beach resident staggered 
into the restaurant and collapsed. Horrified patrons and workers tried to give 
him first aid. The victim died a short time later at Pacific Hospital Care 
Center, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Flournoy was African American, and the two suspects are white, police 
have received inquiries about whether the slaying was a hate crime and are 
investigating that possibility, Corcoran said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it must be clearly understood at this point that there is no evidence to 
suggest this was anything more than two individuals coming upon one and an 
altercation ensued, resulting in the death of one," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Jonathan Russell Kennedy, 19, of Huntington Beach on suspicion 
of murder at 12:30 a.m. He is being held in the Huntington Beach jail on 
$250,000 bail and is expected to be arraigned Monday, Corcoran said. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3 p.m., detectives began questioning a second suspect, a 17-year-old 
Huntington Beach youth. He was later arrested on suspicion of murder.

 Sympathetic callers, eager to help a hospitalized boy allegedly tortured by a 
relative, on Friday swamped police and hospital operators. Meanwhile, Orange 
County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez established a special fund to raise money 
for the child. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been inundated," said Orange Police Lt. Timm Browne. "I have a long 
list of names I will be calling back on Monday and telling how they can help." 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-year-old boy remained in stable condition at Children's Hospital of 
Orange County, where surgeons implanted a colostomy bag on his abdomen last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The outpouring of help and sympathy came a day after the boy's aunt, Cynthia 
Medina, 31, surrendered to police on suspicion of torturing her nephew. The 
allegations against Medina include searing the boy's tongue with a hot knife 
and penetrating him anally with a souvenir baseball bat. The boy also had 
suffered welts and bruises, Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's brutality at its worst," Vasquez said. "People are outraged." 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisor said he has been contacted by a lot of people who "want to 
reach out and do something for him."  
</P>
<P>
 "Strangers have been coming by on their lunch hour and dropping off things 
like stuffed animals and toys for the boy," said Orman Day, a Children's 
Hospital of Orange County spokesman. "Even a group of Marines brought by a big 
bag of goodies." 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital has set aside a portion of its front lobby as a drop-off for the 
public. Among the gifts collected Friday were a big stuffed lion with a Rams 
cap, a tiger with a Mighty Ducks cap, balloons and Mighty Morphin Power Ranger 
books. 
</P>
<P>
 "People come here with two emotions: anger and sympathy," Day said. "They're 
really upset. People are really touched by this." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Orange Police Chief John R. Robertson, paid a visit to the young 
boy at the hospital and gave him a baseball cap with the city of Orange Police 
Department logo, POGs, a backpack, T-shirt, ruler, pencils and a wind-up police 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 "We assured the boy that when he can be picked up, we will do so in a police 
car and give him a ride to our police station where he will be given a guided 
tour of the Police Department," Browne said. "Even (Deputy Dist. Atty.) Chuck 
Middleton has been over there and gave him a stuffed toy." 
</P>
<P>
 Offers of help also came from Orange police officers, Orange County sheriff's 
academy staff members, and many others, including the boy's schoolmates at 
Sycamore Elementary School in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim McMillen, Sycamore's principal, where the boy and Medina's 9-year-old son 
are enrolled, said the school's children and teachers were sending balloons and 
stuffed bears to try and cheer them up. Medina's son was placed by county 
authorities in Orangewood Children's Home Sept. 8 after officials learned of 
the the older boy's injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they did not know how long the 10-year-old would remain in 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "The nurses at the hospital gave him baseball cards yesterday," Brown said. 
"It's just incredible. The nursing staff was virtually in tears." 
</P>
<P>
 At the hospital, a Spanish-language television reporter left in tears after 
wrapping up a segment on the boy's condition and the outpouring of sympathy, 
Day said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The boy has gotten so many gifts he has given some of them to other young 
children in the same unit to cheer them up," Day said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those interested in making a donation to the fund set up by Vasquez can mail 
it to OC Cares Trust Fund, Orange National Bank, P.O. Box 6040, Orange, 92667. 
The contact at the bank is Helen Walker at (714) 771-4000.

EVANGELIST ALAMO GETS 6-YEAR TAX SENTENCE; PROSECUTION: L.A. OFFICIALS MUST 
DECIDE WHETHER TO PURSUE CHARGES IN SCHEDULED CHILD-ABUSE TRIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 For the first time since the beginning of his years of trouble with the law, 
flamboyant evangelist Tony Alamo was sentenced to prison Friday, a six-year 
federal tax evasion term that has Los Angeles prosecutors wondering whether 
they need to follow through on his scheduled child-abuse trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Alamo, winding up a three-day hearing in a federal court in Memphis, asked for 
probation or some other alternative to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, you could deport me to Israel and that would be just 
fine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 59-year-old evangelist, who once ran a religious commune in Saugus and 
proselytized throughout the Los Angeles area for converts to his Holy Alamo 
Christian Church, has been at odds with the law for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a fugitive for almost three years after he disappeared in 1989 as Los 
Angeles County authorities investigated allegations that he gave telephone 
instructions to four men to strike an 11-year-old boy 140 times with a large 
paddle at the Saugus commune. 
</P>
<P>
 He was captured in July, 1991, and is still awaiting trial on those charges in 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal judge in Memphis on Friday imposed the maximum possible prison 
term on Alamo, and fined him $210,000 for his June 8 conviction on charges of 
filing a false income tax return in 1985 and failing to file tax returns for 
the next three years, IRS spokesman Dan Boone said. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been jailed since his conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Alamo, whose real name is Bernie Lazar Hoffman, was scheduled to return to Los 
Angeles to stand trial on state charges in the alleged beating of young 
Jeremiah Miller, but the federal prison sentence has local prosecutors 
wondering if the effort would be worth it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd have to look at the case again in light of the six-year sentence," said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. John Asari, the prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 Asari said his office must now consider how much of the federal sentence Alamo 
will serve, and weigh the trauma to Miller of putting him on the witness stand 
against the additional prison time Alamo might receive if he is convicted on 
the child-abuse charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point we're prepared to go to trial," Asari said. "But this gives us 
something to think of, in terms of settling the case." 
</P>
<P>
 A hearing on the case is scheduled for Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Alamo gained fame and fortune when he and his wife Susan founded the Holy 
Alamo Christian Church in the 1960s, taking young dropouts and drug users off 
the streets of Hollywood and providing them with food, shelter and 
anti-Catholic religious sermons. 
</P>
<P>
 Communes and church-owned businesses staffed with free labor by hundreds of 
followers in California, Arkansas and Tennessee earned millions of dollars in 
the 1970s and 1980s, particularly off the production of glitzy 
rhinestone-studded denim jackets Alamo designed, which sold in exclusive 
boutiques for as much as $600 each. 
</P>
<P>
 But with success came allegations of child abuse, labor exploitation and 
luxurious living, and the IRS stripped the Alamo Foundation of its tax-exempt 
status. IRS officials claim that the Alamos shortchanged the IRS an estimated 
$10 million in taxes on income earned from a variety of businesses, using the 
tax-exempt Tony and Susan Alamo Foundation and later the Music Square Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Alamo argued he owed no taxes because he had no salary. He said the businesses 
financed his Christian ministry and the church simply supported him as its 
spiritual leader. 
</P>
<P>
 After his wife Susan died of cancer in 1982, Alamo placed her body on display 
in their Arkansas mansion for several weeks, saying he expected her to rise 
from the dead. Later, her body was interred in a marble mausoleum, from which 
it was stolen in 1991. It has not been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 During Alamo's tax evasion trial in Memphis, the government accused him of 
controlling the private lives of his followers and of sexually preying on 
teen-age girls in the church. 
</P>
<P>
 An IRS investigator said Alamo has married eight of his followers since early 
last year, including two 15-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Produce a marriage license, just one, and I'll eat it without salt and 
pepper," Alamo said in a rambling statement prior to sentencing by U.S. 
District Judge Jon McCalla. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the government might want to prosecute God for impregnating Mary "when 
she was 12 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would be a good one for the government to do," he said.

JUDGE SENTENCES SAMUELS TO DEATH; COURTS: JURY'S RECOMMENDATION THAT THE 'GREEN 
WIDOW' FACE THE GAS CHAMBER FOR ARRANGING THE MURDERS OF HER HUSBAND AND A HIT 
MAN IS UPHELD. SHE BECOMES THE STATE'S FIFTH WOMAN ON DEATH ROW SINCE 1977. 
</P>

<P>
 Mary Ellen Samuels, portrayed during her murder trial as a cold, calculating 
"green widow" who orchestrated two murders for money, on Friday became the 
fifth woman to be sentenced to death since California resumed capital 
punishment 17 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten members of the jury that in July had recommended Samuels' execution packed 
the courtroom's front rows as Superior Court Judge Michael R. Hoff formally 
sentenced Samuels to die for orchestrating the murders of her husband and the 
hit man she hired to arrange the husband's killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, outside the courtroom, several jurors said the judge had validated 
their decision that Samuels, a 47-year-old grandmother, deserved execution for 
her crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to let people know we were sure," said juror Karen Hudson, 
explaining the jurors' presence. 
</P>
<P>
 As in all capital cases, the Samuels verdict will be reviewed by the state 
Supreme Court, a process that could take at least two years. An expected 
appellate issue is whether one of the Samuels jurors felt pressured by the 
others when she asked to be excused during deliberations because she was unable 
to vote for the death penalty. She was replaced by an alternate. 
</P>
<P>
 Within the next few weeks, Samuels will join two other former San Fernando 
Valley women who also have been convicted of killing for money and are awaiting 
execution at the state's Central California Women's Facility in the San Joaquin 
Valley city of Chowchilla. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other women on Death Row were sentenced by judges and juries in Orange and 
San Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
 They are expected to be joined shortly by a sixth woman, the first from 
Northern California. A San Mateo County jury ruled in August that she should be 
sentenced to death, and a judge is scheduled to sentence her next month. 
</P>
<P>
 During the early stages of her case, Samuels rejected a plea bargain that 
would have spared her life, Deputy District Atty. Janice Maurizi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Maurizi nor Samuels' current defense attorneys were involved with the 
case at the time.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels was convicted July 1 of multiple counts of murder with the special 
circumstances of soliciting murder and conspiracy to murder. 
</P>
<P>
 According to testimony, she first hired a reputed drug dealer to murder her 
40-year-old husband, Robert Samuels, a motion picture camera assistant who had 
decided to divorce her following a three-year marital separation and several 
unsuccessful reconciliation attempts. He was bludgeoned and shot to death in 
his Northridge home in December, 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurizi had argued that Samuels plotted to kill her husband for two years, 
after realizing he was "worth more to her dead than alive." Samuels would have 
received a $30,000 settlement in the divorce, the prosecutor said, but as a 
widow she inherited $500,000 in real estate, business and insurance proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels also was found guilty of funneling $5,000 to two other men to kill the 
original contract killer, 27-year-old James Bernstein, to prevent him from 
cooperating with police. Bernstein was suspected of arranging the murder of 
Robert Samuels, but not of being the actual gunman. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have never made public the identity of Robert Samuels' alleged 
gunman, but Maurizi said he is believed to be dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernstein, who was engaged to marry Samuels' daughter Nicole, was strangled in 
June, 1989, by Paul Edwin Gaul and Darrell Ray Edwards. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaul and Edwards testified for the prosecution against Samuels under plea 
agreements that spared them the death penalty. Both are serving sentences of 15 
years to life in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 During the year between her husband's murder and her arrest, Samuels inherited 
and spent more than $500,000 on a Porsche, a Cancun condo, vacations, fur 
coats, rented limousines, nightclub hopping and custom outfits from a trendy 
West Hollywood store called Trashy Lingerie. 
</P>
<P>
 Her lavish spending habits inspired police and prosecutors to dub Samuels "the 
green widow." 
</P>
<P>
 The trial also included testimony about lurid love letters, male strippers, 
mother-daughter cheesecake photos, cocaine sniffing, botched murder schemes and 
a talking parrot that cursed the police. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most eye-catching evidence: A photograph taken of Samuels by a lover 
within months of the murders, showing her on a hotel bed, nude and smiling, her 
body covered with about $20,000 in $100 bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why did she do it? For the love of money," Susan Conroy, Robert Samuels' 
younger sister, told reporters in a courthouse corridor. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy, who lives in Corona, had urged Hoff to impose the death penalty upon 
her sister-in-law, who grew up with Conroy and her brother in Santa Ana.  
</P>
<P>
 Conroy said her brother, who worked on films such as "The Color Purple," 
"Heaven Can Wait" and "Lethal Weapon 2," still is "missed very much by his 
family, his friends and his profession." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was taken away from us in such a brutal fashion, and for only one reason. 
Greed. She must now fact the consequences of her actions." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Samuels nor her two defense attorneys, Philip Nameth and Josh Groshan, 
said anything to the judge before sentencing. The defense had sought a new 
trial, alleging misconduct on the part of the prosecutor and some jurors, but 
Hoff denied that appeal Friday, immediately before passing sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels also declined to speak with the probation officer who prepared her 
sentencing report, except to make a single point: 
</P>
<P>
 "The defendant did wish the court to know that although she has been depicted 
as a 'green widow' who would do anything for money, she has continually refused 
to tell her story to the tabloids," Deputy Probation Officer Richard A. 
Richardson wrote in his report. 
</P>
<P>
 Announcing the results of his independent review of the case, the judge 
declared that the jury's guilty and death verdicts were "clearly supported by 
the evidence," which he described as "overwhelming . . . extensive, vivid, 
graphic and most compelling." 
</P>
<P>
 "It clearly demonstrated that the defendant planned the murders for a long 
time, and had the ability to convince others to do her dirty work. . . . The 
defendant involved many people, even her own teen-age daughter and her 
daughter's friends."  
</P>
<P>
 Recapping testimony from the penalty phase of Samuels' trial, Hoff found scant 
evidence of any positive character traits to counter the gravity of her crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 She had a normal childhood, the judge observed, made many family trips to 
Disneyland, dearly loved a pet dog named Patches, taught a stepdaughter to bake 
cookies, and was considered a "den mother" and Bible class leader at the County 
Jail for women, where she has been held for the past four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Pina, who befriended Samuels in jail and attended the trial daily, 
crossed herself as Samuels was led from the courtroom by several deputies. A 
man, who told reporters he was a former boyfriend, strained to catch her eye, 
but Samuels did not acknowledge him. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuels' daughter, Nicole, who defied her own lawyer's advice and testified on 
her mother's behalf during the trial, did not attend the sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Maurizi said prosecutors consider Nicole Samuels Moroianu, now 26 and the 
mother of a young son, to be an unindicted co-conspirator. Prosecutors still 
are contemplating filing charges against her in the deaths of her stepfather 
and fiance. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no statute of limitations for murder," Maurizi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Samuels and her daughter denied plotting to kill anyone and claimed on 
the witness stand that Robert Samuels had abused them. 
</P>
<P>
 But several of the daughter's high school friends testified that she had asked 
them at school where she could find a gun to kill her stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When she arrives in Chowchilla, Samuels will be joining a small group of women 
whose ranks have slowly increased during the past five years. As of Sept. 1, 
there were 390 inmates under sentence of death, four of them women, the state 
Department of Corrections says. 
</P>
<P>
 Maureen McDermott, a nurse convicted of killing a roommate to collect a 
$100,000 mortgage insurance policy, also received a death sentence from a Van 
Nuys jury in 1990, and was the first woman on Death Row. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, a Downtown jury sentenced West Hills widow Catherine Thompson 
to be executed for murdering her mechanic husband so she could collect a 
$400,000 insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The others are Maria del Rosio Alfaro, an admitted drug addict who was 
sentenced to die by an Orange County jury for stabbing a 9-year-old girl to 
death during a burglary, and Cynthia Lynn Coffman, sentenced in both Orange and 
San Bernardino counties to die for the abduction-murders of two women during a 
cross-county crime spree with her tattooed biker boyfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Only four women have legally been put to death by the state since 1893. But 
503 men have been executed, the majority of them by hanging. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the capital punishment laws were revised in 1977, two men have been 
executed in California: Robert Alton Harris and David Edwin Mason, who was 
executed a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The first woman to die in California's gas chamber was Juanita Spinelli in 
1941. The most recent was Elizabeth Ann Duncan, a 59-year-old Ventura County 
woman convicted of hiring two men to kill her daughter-in-law. She died in the 
gas chamber at San Quentin State Prison on Aug. 8, 1962.

MANY SCHOOLS SCRAMBLE TO FILL CLASSROOM OPENINGS; EDUCATION: PARENTS USED NEW 
OPEN ENROLLMENT POLICY TO APPLY AT SEVERAL VALLEY CAMPUSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Despite lotteries and waiting lists, the deadline for open enrollment in the 
L.A. Unified School District found most schools this week scrambling to fill 
openings. Because parents shopped for schools last spring -- applying at 
several campuses -- many administrators were left with extra space at some of 
the most popular schools in the Valley. Students failed to show up, for 
instance, at Taft and Granada Hills high schools, because they were accepted at 
other campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools where the number of applications exceeded the amount of classroom 
space available held lotteries last spring and created waiting lists of 
students who didn't get in. This is the first year of the district's open 
enrollment policy. 
</P>
<P>
 At many popular Valley schools, where lotteries were held and parents 
complained when their children were put on waiting lists, dozens of students 
failed to enroll this week. At Hale Middle School, which held a lottery in 
June, 75 students were expected but 55 showed up. At Granada Hills High, which 
accepted 125 students and had 200 on a waiting list last spring, only about 100 
actually enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials say they had no way of knowing who would enroll until classes 
began this week. When the students failed to show, school clerks and office 
workers began calling parents on the waiting lists. Even then, however, they 
found numerous students who were no longer interested in their schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people were definitely school-shopping and signed up at several 
schools," said Joan Lewis, assistant principal at Granada Hills High School. 
"This was the first time we've ever dealt with this -- we didn't know exactly 
what to expect." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Taft High School Principal Ron Berz: "There are some quirks in the 
system. You think these kids are coming to you, but you don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Taft had more than 600 students apply for 600 open slots. Berz said about 40 
students failed to show up and the school began calling students this week from 
the waiting lists. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said they anticipated that parents would apply at regular 
schools and magnets and then choose where to send their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order to make sure they get in, the parents are going to apply at 
different schools," said Joyce Peyton, who oversees the open enrollment 
program. "It is an inconvenience but if you're going to allow people to choose 
schools, there's going to be some inconvenience." 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, the district expects to begin the open enrollment process earlier 
so that parents and administrators have a better idea on how many students plan 
to attend the campuses. This year, the district allowed students to apply until 
June 14, when lotteries were held. But applications were accepted until Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The district adopted an open enrollment policy last year in line with state 
legislation to allow parents to choose campuses outside their neighborhoods as 
long as space was available and ethnic balances remained intact. The district 
does not guarantee bus transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the open enrollment applications came from students who live nearby 
but outside campus attendance boundaries. Some parents said they wanted their 
children in schools with better reputations. Few are traveling long distances. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft, in fact, enrolled about 160 students from private and parochial schools, 
Berz said. 
</P>
<P>
 While officials are not yet keeping districtwide tallies on open enrollment, 
they say they had 9,100 open classroom seats in the Valley. But because the 
policy allows siblings to attend the same campuses, officials say more than 
10,000 students are attending new campuses this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Some administrators say they were taken by surprise when students failed to 
show up this week. "They didn't tell us this wasn't their first choice -- we 
assumed we were everyone's first choice," said Michael Bennett, the principal 
at Parkman Junior High, where 65 fewer students enrolled. "Some people just 
hedged their bets." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the large numbers of students who turned up in some grade levels 
and not in others, some schools will be reorganizing classrooms earlier this 
year. "We have too many students in some classrooms," said Ed Krojansky, 
principal at Sherman Oaks Elementary. "It's somewhat disconcerting but we're 
sorting it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman Oaks had 70 spaces and enrolled 91 because of siblings who were also 
allowed to attend the campus. On the first few days of school, however, 18 
students failed to show up. 
</P>
<P>
 The schools also found that most students applied for the lower grade levels. 
At Parkman, more sixth-graders enrolled, and at Taft, more ninth- and 
tenth-graders enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the numbers of students who didn't show up, administrators said they 
generally are pleased with the new program. "I think it's great -- it allows 
parents freedom of choice," Krojansky said.

GIANT REED A THREAT TO LIFE ALONG BULL CREEK; ENVIRONMENT: COUNTY EARMARKS 
$200,000 TO COMBAT THE ARUNDO DONAX INFESTATION IN SEPULVEDA BASIN RECREATION 
AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Only about 100 yards from speeding traffic and just beyond the range of errant 
golf balls, the giant reeds rise 20 feet or more, clacking together in the hot 
afternoon wind. 
</P>
<P>
 Easily mistaken for bamboo, with leaves that form a jungle canopy over the 
slow-moving waters of Bull Creek, the Arundo donax provides an exotic, inviting 
contrast to the concrete floor of the San Fernando Valley and the nearby 
man-made lake. 
</P>
<P>
 They are lush. And they are Big Trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pernicious, insidious nature . . . of this Arundo is just overwhelming," 
said Jill Swift of the Coalition to Save Sepulveda Basin. "I don't know of 
anything you can use Arundo for." 
</P>
<P>
 And so Swift and other local conservationists were thrilled by news this week 
that the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors is providing a $200,000 grant 
to combat the reed infestation along the creek, which meanders through the 
Sepulveda Basin Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant, given jointly to the Los Angeles city government and the Los 
Angeles office of the National Audubon Society, comes from a fund created by 
Proposition A, the 1992 property assessment measure passed to promote parkland 
improvements and acquisitions. Most of the money will go to pay California 
Conservation Corps crews to uproot the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservationists hope the project will help save one of the last natural-state 
tributaries of the Los Angeles River. 
</P>
<P>
 But what's so awful about Arundo donax anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 "It keeps trees from growing, it keeps shrubs from growing," explains Melanie 
Ingalls of the Los Angeles office of the Audubon Society. "This is nasty 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Imported from Spain over 100 years ago, the giant reed was first planted to 
control erosion, mainly along waterways. Conservationists soon discovered, 
however, that the plant was nearly impossible to control. 
</P>
<P>
 It spread rapidly, it seeds borne both by water and air, and eliminated nearly 
everything in its path. It displaced native plants and forced out animals. It 
choked healthy streams. 
</P>
<P>
 With seeds that spread easily, the plant can move through a river system 
quickly. Bull Creek is not the only Southland waterway being invaded by the 
reed. The Nature Conservancy is fighting a thick infestation along the Santa 
Ana River in Orange County, and nature lovers say the problem is growing along 
numerous other streams. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear how and when Arundo was introduced along Bull Creek, although it 
probably occurred several decades ago. The most likely scenario has seeds being 
transported downstream from infestations near the creek's headwaters in the 
Simi Hills.  
</P>
<P>
 What is clear is the damage the reed has inflicted on the creek between 
Victory Boulevard and the Los Angeles River. 
</P>
<P>
 "We very rarely see anything good anymore," said Sandy Wohlgemuth, 
conservation chairman for the local Audubon Society, referring to the many 
species of plants and animals that formerly called the stream home. "And the 
reason is the proliferation of non-native weeds." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As the breeze rattled through the thickets on a recent afternoon, a great blue 
heron burst from the slow-moving waters of the narrow stream. Later, a pair of 
egrets wandered a nearby paths. But these were the only signs of life over a 
two-hour stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the reed came, brightly colored wood ducks with their sculpted crowns 
regularly paddled the creek, Wohlgemuth said. Brown bitterns and various owls 
patrolled the banks in search of food and nesting materials. No more. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's utterly useless as far as bird habitat is concerned," he said of the 
reed. "We never see any birds in the Arundo ." 
</P>
<P>
 The giant stalks also crowd out many native plants, sucking up as much as five 
times the water of the typical stream-side flora and growing as much as six 
inches in a day. Many of the sycamore trees of old are gone, as are most 
willows and elderberry bushes. 
</P>
<P>
 The reeds have already begun to clog the stream, threatening the minnows and 
other small aquatic creatures that require flowing water to flourish. And with 
the confluence with the Los Angeles River just a few hundred yards downstream, 
experts say waterborne Arundo seeds could easily take root along the big 
waterway's banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Removing the reeds -- as well as the less troublesome but also non-native 
castor bean and tree tobacco -- is an ambitious project. It will likely last 
about four months after getting under way some time this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep the hardy reeds from returning, crews will have to hack through the 
stalks just inches above the ground. Then, in the minutes before the reeds can 
excrete a protective gel, they must coat the exposed trunks with a herbicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Bull Creek has been severely damaged, those involved in the project say, but 
not irreparably. Once the Arundo is removed, the stream should flourish again. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Swift: "You're going to start seeing birds in there you didn't know 
existed." Arundo Attack A non-native, bamboo-like plant called Arundo donax is 
infesting Bull Creek in the Sepulveda Dam Recreation Area. Money from a 
Proposition A fund will be used to hire crews to remove the aggressively 
growing plant. * 
</P>
<P>
 Arundo Donax Description: Commonly referred to as bamboo or cane. Can reach a 
height of 20 feet or more, with leaves two feet long. Habitat: Needs rich, 
moist soil such as wetland habitat. A water guzzler, its roots tap into ground 
water, denying moisture to nearby plants. Origin: Europe Residential use: 
Planted as windbreak or to control erosion.

REGIONAL PARK DECLARED SAFE AND IS REOPENED; MOUNTAIN LIONS: TWO SIGHTINGS ARE 
REPORTED, BUT RANGERS DETERMINE THE ANIMALS POSE NO IMMINENT THREAT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A week after closing Happy Camp Canyon Regional Park because of a mountain 
lion scare, park officials have reopened the 3,000-acre wilderness area, saying 
it is now safe for visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Park rangers and volunteers on horseback went through the park several times 
during the weeklong closure looking for aggressive mountain lion behavior. 
While two sightings were reported, the rangers and a wildlife biologist from 
the state Department of Fish and Game determined the mountain lions posed no 
imminent threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're of the opinion that while there might be a heightened level of danger 
with cats in the area, they do not pose a threat to public safety," said Capt. 
Roger Reese, who heads Fish and Game's Ventura office. 
</P>
<P>
 The regional park was closed Sept. 9 after a pair of mountain lions reportedly 
stalked two horseback riders. One of the cats came up under a horse ridden by 
Sharon Virzi, 41, and bared its teeth. Virzi and her companion, Robin Phipps, 
27, said they turned their horses to ride away but another cat blocked their 
path.  
</P>
<P>
 The two women then doubled back, riding up the trail to escape. At least one 
of the cats followed them for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 Rorie Skei, assistant executive director of the East County Conservation 
Authority, said the mountain lions were probably surprised by the women while 
lying in wait for deer. She suspects the mountain lion that followed the women 
was not stalking them but simply ensuring that the riders left the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was definitely an unusual encounter but we feel it was an anomaly," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, when the wilderness area reopens, a docent is scheduled to lead a 
family walk through part of the park, Skei said.  
</P>
<P>
 She said people can protect themselves from mountain lion attack by traveling 
in pairs and taking other precautions. Park officials are posting permanent 
warning signs letting visitors know that the park is mountain lion habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the two mountain lions reported this week, one was encountered by Pearl 
Hasty near Embley Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually I didn't see it, I heard it," Hasty said. "It's not the first time, 
but I was feeding (my) animals later than usual and when I came to the back 
fence I heard it growl, hiss and carry on like they do." 
</P>
<P>
 If Fish and Game had determined that the mountain lions posed a public safety 
threat, trackers would have been sent to kill the animals. Hasty, who has lived 
in the area a number of years, said she was happy that the cats will not be 
harmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you like nature you get very excited by something like this," she said. 
"That's why we're way out here, because we enjoy the wildlife." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who regularly use the park said they were worried that the attention 
focused on last week's encounter would lead to unnecessary hysteria about 
mountain lions in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should always be aware of the dangers when going into a wilderness area," 
said Jim Hartley, who with his wife, Madeline, heads the volunteer Mounted 
Assistance Unit that rides through the park every week. 
</P>
<P>
 "But let's put the danger in perspective," said. "I'll bet there have been 
more people killed on the 118 (freeway) in the last few years than have been 
killed by mountain lions in the last 50. There are a lot of risks in life, and 
I don't think people would want to eliminate the risk by eliminating what 
wildlife we have left. I've been riding in the park for years and I would count 
myself lucky if I ever saw a mountain lion."

FINANCIAL ROADBLOCK; LACK OF CLEANUP FUNDS LEAVES RESIDENTS ISOLATED BY A 
LANDSLIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Six decades of paying taxes, and Frank Azcarate is getting impatient. 
</P>
<P>
 "What else are taxes for, if not for things like this?" he said of the delay 
in clearing a landslide that has shut off his closest route to Santa Paula. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second time in two years, tons of falling rocks and earth have closed 
South Mountain Road, from three quarters of a mile south of Santa Paula to 
Balcom Canyon Road. Officials are saying cleanup funds are unavailable, just as 
they did after a slide in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a Mickey Mouse deal," said Azcarate, 74, who now must drive about 
15 miles farther to get to Santa Paula. "When I was a boy, they used to (clean 
up landslides) with horses." 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Martinez, like scores of others along this rural mountain road, is 
angry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they should try to find the money," Martinez, 33, said of budget 
constraints that authorities say might delay reopening the road until spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, residents east of the slide above the Santa Clara River must reach 
Santa Paula through Fillmore. What was only a few miles away before -- stores, 
work, doctors -- now is 15 to 20 miles away, a delay of 30 minutes or more. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, some residents are worried about being isolated during a 
wildfire, their escape shut off by the road closure. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were out there all the time cleaning the road, cleaning out the 
ditches," said Joan Robison, 56, "and now when there's an emergency . . . they 
say they don't have the money." 
</P>
<P>
 In their own ways -- some stoically, some vocally -- those who live along this 
drowsy stretch of orchards and oil rigs are feeling abandoned all over again. 
</P>
<P>
 They might have rustic silence, sweeping views of the mountains and ranch 
houses lost in groves of citrus and avocado trees. But they also have a nearby 
hillside that literally is falling apart, always staying a landslide ahead of a 
financially strapped county road department. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a person I've talked to who isn't (angry)," said Robison, a 
24-year resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandy Deramo, 30, a mother of two who now must take her daughters to private 
school in Santa Paula the long way said "I hope they don't just fix what's on 
the road (this time), but that they fix what's causing the problem, up there on 
the mountain." 
</P>
<P>
 It all began April 3, 1993, when spring rains caused as much as 160,000 tons 
of 22-million-year-old sediment to cascade onto South Mountain Road. Eleven 
weeks later, after county officials cast about for the necessary cleanup funds, 
they reopened the road. 
</P>
<P>
 It could take longer this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have the funding to pay the contractors right now," said Butch 
Britt, head of the Ventura County transportation department. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like the larger one last year, the Sept. 8 slide left thousands of tons of 
earth and boulders hanging precariously from the cliff. Cleanup crews must work 
from above, gingerly nudging the loose material down to the road before 
trucking it away. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can't get up there working before the rainy season . . . it'd be 
unlikely that we'd be able to work up there until late next spring," Britt 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials, who estimate the cleanup cost at about $200,000, hope they 
can persuade the federal government that the landslide is earthquake-related, 
triggered by an aftershock of the Jan. 17 Northridge temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 If so, the federal government would help the county pay for the work, in which 
case the road could possibly be reopened in about two months, Britt said. 
</P>
<P>
 If not, said county Supervisor Maggie Kildee, whose 3rd District includes the 
Santa Paula area, "then we'd have to find other sources (of funding) and 
they're very few and far between." 
</P>
<P>
 County geologist Jim Fisher, whose preliminary report indeed links the slide 
to an aftershock, noted that the earth movement apparently occurred after a 3.1 
quake at 2:56 a.m. near San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the 6.8 Northridge earthquake was more than a thousand times 
stronger, it was not enough to cause the slide, Fisher said. "Perhaps (the 
Sept. 8) aftershock was the final, ultimate trigger, the straw that broke the 
camel's back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first to see the tumbling rocks, Sheriff's Deputy Steve Mayorga, 
said the bulk of the slide came down about two hours after the aftershock. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayorga said the scene was eerie: the debris piling up against his cruiser, 
the dust turned red by the car's rotating lights. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the more awesome thing I've seen in my entire life," Mayorga said. 
</P>
<P>
 Louise Taylor, who has lived on South Mountain Road since the 1920s, is 
unimpressed with such things -- and unconvinced that an earthquake caused the 
slide. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lived here all my life," said Taylor, who lives on the Santa Paula side 
of the slide. "And (slides are) constantly happening . . . It's something we've 
always contended with." 
</P>
<P>
 What troubles many residents is that the latest slide, unlike last year's, 
comes at the beginning of the fall fire season. They fear that a massive blaze 
approaching from the east could block their only escape routes, South Mountain 
and Balcom Canyon roads. 
</P>
<P>
 To the west, now corralled by a chain-link fence to keep people away, is the 
slide. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, who is eight months pregnant with her first child, is particularly 
upset that her twice-weekly trips to her doctor in Ventura -- and ultimately to 
the hospital for the delivery -- are now up to 50 minutes longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's having a difficult pregnancy," said 37-year-old Greg Martinez, her 
husband. "So it kind of makes me mad that they don't want to do anything about 
(the slide), and that we have to go out of our way to go to the doctor." 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Deramo, 29, a cook at Carrows restaurant in Ojai, now must leave for work 
a half-hour earlier each day, at 4 a.m., because of the detour. He also is 
spending twice as much on gas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The same goes for Oscar Avila, 34. Employed at an oil-industry supplier in 
Ventura, Avila now must take Balcom Canyon Road to work. But this is a slower 
route with at least two hairpin curves, including one with a 10-m.p.h. advisory 
sign, as the road snakes through the hills. 
</P>
<P>
 At night, the two-lane road is especially treacherous, Avila said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Brownie, a county engineer who was inspecting the site, looked up at the 
scarred cavities left by last year's slide and the slide on Sept. 8. Halfway up 
is a gaping fissure that angled its way up the cliff while an oak tree, 
teetering in its loosened bed, seems poised to come down. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even feel comfortable standing here," he said. "It looks like it's 
stabilized, but you never really can tell." 
</P>
<P>
 To the east on South Mountain Road, Melanie Haug had driven up to her mailbox 
after completing six errands, rather than the one or two she otherwise would 
have done. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more a matter of preparing now," said Haug, 37, an emergency room nurse 
who commutes to Los Angeles. "It's more like the 'Little House on the Prairie,' 
where you go to town only once a week." 
</P>
<P>
 A newcomer to the community, Haug added: "I suppose if I still lived in Palos 
Verdes, (I would) be furious, stressed out. But that's just the trade-off of 
living here . . . You sort of have a different attitude when you live in the 
country."

COUNTY POSTS 8.8% JOBLESS RATE; FIGURE CALLED INFLATED; LABOR: EXPERTS SAY 
SEASONAL FACTORS, INCLUDING SUMMER RECESS AT SCHOOLS, RAISED AUGUST 
UNEMPLOYMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura County's unemployment rate for August was 8.8%, state officials 
reported Friday, a figure that economists say is artificially inflated by two 
seasonal factors. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 3,000 educators show up as unemployed in the report because schools 
were in summer recess. Also, harvesting temporarily slowed down, putting 1,700 
farm laborers out of work. 
</P>
<P>
 The August rate is slightly lower than July's 9.3% figure. A year ago at this 
time, the county's unemployment rate was 9.5%. Ventura County's unemployment 
rate remains nearly three points higher than the national rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, lulls in agricultural production hit in July and August, then 
again in December and January, said Rex Laird, head of the Ventura County Farm 
Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 But workers already have started planting strawberries, which will need to be 
harvested in a few months. And the second phase of the vegetable season is just 
beginning, Laird said. 
</P>
<P>
 The need for workers to harvest those crops should soon help boost the 
unemployment rate, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would even anticipate some pickup in September," Laird said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Schniepp, an economist with the UC Santa Barbara Economic Forecast 
Project, said there were no surprises in the report. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no net great news in here," Schniepp said. "But is it negative? No. 
It is really just kind of neutral." 
</P>
<P>
 Other major losses were in finance, real estate, insurance and services, which 
each lost 500 jobs. Manufacturing, which has been steadily declining over the 
past year, lost 300 jobs. Schniepp said that trend is expected to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Small gains were posted in retail -- a consistently healthy area for the 
county over the past year -- and the construction trade grew by 200 jobs, 
probably as a result of post-earthquake construction and repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those jobs will probably be very temporary," Schniepp said. "But what the 
heck, a job is a job at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 Schniepp said one figure in the report did jump out at him: a drop of 5,600 in 
the county's labor force since July. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is where you are getting the real drop in the unemployment rate," he 
said. "Either these people are getting discouraged and not even bothering to 
look for a job, or they are leaving the county to find work elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea that the economy may be forcing residents out of the county is 
particularly disturbing to Carolyn Leavens, president of the Ventura County 
Economic Development Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to keep these highly skilled people in Ventura if we can," Leavens 
said. "Change always comes hard to us and we tend to wail and gnash our teeth. 
But change is only bad if you let it roll right over you." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County needs to reinvent its economy, Leavens said. Workers with 
technical skills, particularly those previously employed in manufacturing, need 
to be retrained and encouraged to go out on their own and start new businesses, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to look at the whole picture differently," she said. "Our answers 
are going to be different than they ever have been before. If the powers that 
be in Ventura County can give these people the support they need then we can do 
it."

CITY ASKED TO CONSIDER INTERCHANGE; VENTURA FREEWAY: PROJECT WOULD ROUTE 
MOTORISTS TO MALL AND HARBOR. CRITICS SAY IT WOULD VIOLATE GREENBELT PACT.

 Ventura City Councilman Jim Monahan on Friday asked the city to consider 
building an interchange on the Ventura Freeway near Lemon Grove Avenue, a move 
that could bring thousands of cars daily to an area recently earmarked to 
remain farmland. 
</P>
<P>
 Monahan's proposal was attacked by Councilman Gary Tuttle, who said he would 
not support any violation of the city's greenbelt agreement with Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a proposal that died a long time ago, and it should be put back to 
sleep," Tuttle said. "I certainly will fight it to my last breath." 
</P>
<P>
 Monahan said he brought the issue before Friday's meeting of the city's 
transportation committee because the interchange would route motorists more 
efficiently to Ventura Harbor and Buenaventura Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 As envisioned by Monahan, the interchange would be built on farmland 
surrounding the freeway at the so-called Lemon Overhead. The overhead is less 
than a mile south of the southernmost end of Lemon Grove Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Monahan said the interchange would alleviate traffic on Harbor Boulevard 
created by drivers who exit at Seaward Avenue and then use the boulevard to 
backtrack to the harbor. He said roads built in conjunction with the 
interchange would connect two important business hubs in the city -- the mall 
and the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Everett Millais, Ventura's director of community services, told Monahan that 
his plan would be contentious before the full City Council because at least 
four of its seven members have indicated they will not support any development 
in the greenbelt. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the project managed to win council approval, said Senior Traffic 
Engineer Nazir Lalani, funding for it would not be available for at least three 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "The underlying message is even if we start planning now, we're not going to 
see anything there for 25 to 30 years," Lalani said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monahan said that for now he would settle for putting the issue up for 
consideration when the city reviews its General Plan, expected to take place by 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just bringing it up so we can initiate the process," Monahan said. "I'm 
not saying we should spend any money." 
</P>
<P>
 The two other council members on the transportation committee, Rosa Lee 
Measures and Jack Tingstrom, supported Monahan's request to examine the 
interchange when the General Plan is amended. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Clark, a resident of the Ventura Keys neighborhood, said he applauds 
Monahan's action. An interchange closer to the harbor would allow motorists to 
bypass his neighborhood, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But even Clark seemed to doubt whether the interchange would ever get built. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be a grand idea," said the 62-year-old activist. "I'll try to follow 
my doctor's orders to exercise and eat well, and maybe I'll live long enough to 
see it." 
</P>
<P>
 An interchange at the Lemon Overhead was discussed by the council in the 
mid-70s, Millais told the committee. But it was removed from consideration when 
the city amended its General Plan a few years later, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the area surrounding the Lemon Overhead has been designated as a 
greenbelt. That agreement, signed by the cities of Ventura and Oxnard earlier 
this year, requires that no development take place on the farmland for at least 
five years.

QUAKE-HIT ADOBE HOME PASSED OVER FOR FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 First Shirley and Robert Lorenz were devastated at the sight of what the 
Northridge earthquake did to their family's 1853 adobe ranch house, a Ventura 
County historical landmark near Piru. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they are devastated by the news they did not get any federal grant money 
to repair the Camulos Ranch, a sprawling Spanish structure they want to turn 
into a public museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that they were turned down," said Pam O'Connor, program manager for 
the Historic Preservation Partnership for Earthquake Repair, which distributed 
$3.25 million in federal funds to repair historical landmarks damaged by the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are still in line for funding, but unfortunately the funds were 
exhausted before they came up." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connor said the partnership reviewed 24 grant applications and rated them 
all on a point system. Camulos Ranch was tied for seventh on that list, and the 
six applications in front of it all received grants. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing her family home was just inches away from a grant gives little comfort 
to Shirley Lorenz. She still has to put on a hard hat to walk through the 
adobe, and there is no need to point out damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Whole chunks of rooms are gone, crumbled into piles of plaster and dust on 
wooden floors. Cracks lace out over virtually every wall, exposing wooden 
framework and handmade adobe bricks. Fireplaces have been reduced to gaping 
holes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wooden braces prop up several sagging walls, and dust thrown into the air from 
the quake sits thick on the few remaining pieces of furniture. No one would 
need to read the inspection sign on the door to know the adobe is 
uninhabitable. 
</P>
<P>
 "The adobe has been through a lot of earthquakes before," Lorenz said, looking 
sadly at the mess. "But I never remember one quite like this. It went in both 
directions, first east and west, then north and south." 
</P>
<P>
 Lorenz's father, August Rubel, bought the ranch in 1924. It was built by 
Antonio Del Valle on land given to him in 1839 by the Spanish king as a prize 
for securing the Mexican missions. The complex includes a winery, several adobe 
homes, a schoolhouse and a wooden chapel. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 19th Century, the ranch was known as the Lost Mission because of its 
chapel, which offered Franciscan priests a spot to worship between the San 
Fernando and San Buenaventura missions. 
</P>
<P>
 Architectural historian and Southwestern adobe expert Edna Kimbro said she was 
dismayed to learn the Camulos Ranch adobe had been overlooked for funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is absolutely tragic," Kimbro said. "In all of Ventura there are only 
seven remaining adobes, all of them significant. But Rancho Camulos doesn't 
just stand out in Ventura, it is exceptional statewide. It is quite without 
parallel." 
</P>
<P>
 Kimbro helped the Lorenzes write the grants to the Historic Preservation 
Partnership for Earthquake Repair, a group hastily formed after the Jan. 17 
quake. Its members include the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the 
National Park Service, the Los Angeles Conservancy, the state Office of 
Historic Preservation and the Getty Conservation Institute, which Kimbro works 
for. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Kimbro and the Lorenzes feel the application process was confusing and 
poorly handled. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just jerked us all over the place," Shirley Lorenz said. "They held us 
up asking for silly things, they changed rules on us. We feel that it was an 
uneven playing field." 
</P>
<P>
 Two grant applications had to be filed, according to Kimbro, one for technical 
costs -- architects and engineering reports -- and one for construction costs. 
She said she was told the technical grant application had to be approved first. 
But while the Lorenzes were struggling with that application, others were 
bypassing the first step and filing both requests at once. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people skipped Go and went right to Park Place," Kimbro said. "We were 
unaware of that option." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connor said the applications could have been filed concurrently. But by the 
time the Lorenzes and Kimbro found that out, all but $851,000 of the federal 
money was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 She acknowledged the partnership's rocky start, saying staffing problems and 
post-earthquake confusion led to most of the money being allocated before all 
the applications were in. But the partnership's priority was to start repairing 
historical landmarks as soon as possible, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimbro said the original request for federal funds specifically mentioned the 
damage done to many of Southern California's adobes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now it has mainly been expended on Art Deco buildings from the '20s," she 
said. "The adobes were used as a pretext for getting the money in the first 
place. To me that is just unconscionable." 
</P>
<P>
 All partnership grants have to be approved by the state Office of Historic 
Preservation, and Kimbro is hoping officials there will overrule the decision 
of the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Connor said her group is lobbying hard for more federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been aggressively communicating with the Park Service," she said. 
"We're saying to them, look -- there are folks out there who still need money, 
like Camulos Ranch." 
</P>
<P>
 Shirley Lorenz is not placing much faith in the possibility of more federal 
funds turning up for the Northridge disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be some new disaster that comes along soon enough," she said. 
"They'll need money for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Downtown Piru did get one of the grants, which Lorenz said she was grateful 
for. But her dream of turning her family home into a museum is in danger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know in my heart that this thing will get done," she said. "Maybe not in my 
lifetime. But so much can be lost in the near future. Those adobes are very 
fragile. They'll melt away when the rains come."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SOUTH COUNTY; MOUSE HANTAVIRUS THREAT CONTINUES, 
OFFICIALS WARN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Health officials are reminding people in South County who find mice in or 
around their homes to use extra caution because two mice recently were found 
carrying a deadly strain of hantavirus. 
</P>
<P>
 The virus has killed 45 people nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The two latest mice with hantavirus in Orange County were trapped in the 
Whiting Ranch Wilderness Park near Lake Forest and on the back porch of a San 
Juan Capistrano house, said James Webb, a vector ecologist with the Orange 
County Vector Control District. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're concerned that deer mice are invading people's back yards," Webb said 
Friday. Webb said people who encounter mice droppings or carcasses should use 
sanitary means to remove them, and not stir up dust. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Hildy Meyers, an epidemiologist with the Orange County Health Care Agency, 
said people should wear gloves while using a solution of bleach and water to 
cleaning up mice feces or dead carcasses. Vacuuming or sweeping should be 
avoided, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only value of this announcement is to remind people that hantavirus is 
still here," Meyers said. "It should not cause people to panic." 
</P>
<P>
 There are no documented cases of people contracting hantavirus in Orange 
County, Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Statewide, six cases are known, and three of those people were believed to 
have contracted the virus in New Mexico and Washington state, Meyers said. The 
disease causes breathing difficulties and fills the lungs with fluid. It is 
fatal about 50% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Since June of last year, the county has been setting traps in various parts of 
Orange County to catch mice and test them for hantavirus. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the two latest finds, the most recent discovery of a mouse carrying the 
virus was in Irvine on April 29, Webb said. JEFF BEAN

 Tough budget decisions face the City Council on Monday after recent requests 
by residents and employees to spare cuts in public safety services and programs 
to senior citizens and the community. 
</P>
<P>
 The council plans to adopt the city's 1994-95 budget Monday, although it has 
until Sept. 30 to take such action. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters urged the council to reject a proposed $410,000 cut to the Fire 
Department budget, and lifeguards asked that the Marine Safety Division be 
spared any reductions, saying such cutbacks could threaten public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Others opposed proposed cutbacks to the Huntington Beach Community Band and 
reductions in mileage reimbursement for volunteer drivers who deliver meals to 
homebound seniors.  
</P>
<P>
 Residents asked that the council add funding for a full-time position at the 
Michael E. Rodgers Seniors Center. Councilman Ralph Bauer has also asked for 
$500,000 in additional funding for the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "A safe city is the No. 1 priority on the council, and I just want to make 
sure we're not ignoring that No. 1 priority," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Administrator Michael T. Uberuaga told the council this week that the 
various budget requests total about $1.2 million. But he said there is only 
about $297,000 in surplus money available to restore cuts or to provide new 
services.  
</P>
<P>
 The total city budget proposed is $190 million, which includes all funds for 
1994-95. Part of that total budget includes a proposed general fund budget of 
$94.23 million, nearly $2.5 million less than the present budget. DEBRA CANO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; OPPOSITION AGAINST MALL PLAN GROWS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Opposition is heating up against a proposed major expansion of the Sherman 
Oaks Fashion Square mall. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of 700 residents who live near the shopping mall has distributed 700 
flyers decrying the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Tybe Drum, president of the Sherman Oaks Property Owners Assn., said that in 
the next week her group will be sending out another 300 flyers, which urge 
residents to oppose the project at a public hearing scheduled for Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Drum said her group fears the project would create problems of roadway 
congestion, traffic safety and air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our neighborhoods will be ruined over it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fashion Square is proposing a $20-million expansion that would increase the 
size of the mall by nearly 20%, to 975,000 square feet. The project would allow 
Fashion Square to increase the amount of space available for a third anchor 
store to 180,000 square feet. Mall representatives say that much space would 
enable them to attract an upscale department store, such as Nordstrom or 
Bloomingdale's. 
</P>
<P>
 Mall officials say the community wants another department store to replace I. 
Magnin, which left late last year. They said 1,000 people have signed a 
petition in support of the store. KAY HWANGBO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: CYPRESS; COUNCIL EMBRACES PROP. 187 CONCEPT

<P>
 A statewide initiative that would cut education and health services to illegal 
immigrants has received warm praise from several members of the City Council, 
and the entire council is likely to endorse the measure before the Nov. 8 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 The council at its meeting this week said it was not immediately prepared to 
endorse Proposition 187 because members did not have the complete text of the 
initiative.But council members said they like the goals of the measure. They 
said that as soon as copies of the initiative are available, the council will 
schedule a vote on whether to endorse it. 
</P>
<P>
 The matter came before the City Council on Monday night when a Cypress 
resident, Doris Shyken, summarized the goals of Proposition 187 and urged the 
council to endorse it. 
</P>
<P>
 Shyken submitted a proposed resolution to the council. Part of the resolution 
said: "Many of the hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens who enter California 
every year come to Cypress, where their use of public funded services reduces 
the availability of such services for the citizens and legal residents." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Walter K. Bowman said he agreed with the goals of Proposition 187. 
He said that coincidentally national attention has been focused on Cubans who 
are trying to enter Florida illegally. Bowman said the number of illegal 
immigrants moving across the Mexican border into California far outnumbers the 
Cuban exodus to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Gail H. Kerry also spoke warmly in favor of Proposition 187. She 
said people who enter the United States illegally "have no right to be here." 
Kerry added that she thinks the council should support the citizen movement 
that put Proposition 187 on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Joyce C. Nicholson said illegal immigration is a serious problem 
and "the state of California is drowning in it." BILL BILLITER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; TOURNAMENT SHOOTS FOR RACIAL DIVERSITY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To Ruben Ledesma, ethnic diversity is not just a catch-phrase. It's an 
entrance requirement if you want to play in the Shoot 4 Peace Basketball 
Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what makes this tournament different from all the rest," said Ledesma, 
a former gang member who, with the help of legislators and a few community 
groups, started the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The event got under way Wednesday. There are three players on each team, with 
teams divided into junior and senior divisions. The approximately 100 players 
range in age from 13 to 30 years old. Each game is to 15 points or 20 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The championship round will be played today at David M. Gonzalez/Pacoima 
Recreation Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by Rep. Howard L. Berman, state Assemblyman Richard Katz and state 
Sen. David A. Roberti, the tournament did not allow teams with players all of 
the same race to enter. 
</P>
<P>
 Ledesma said he started the tournament to help ease the tensions between young 
African Americans and Latinos in the northeast Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, some of the players were frustrated because they could not find 
suitable partners, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That just shows you we have these types of problems," said Ledesma, 23, of 
Pacoima. But they were able to pair up individual players to form multiethnic 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarterfinals of the tournament start at 9 a.m. Saturday with the 
championship at 11:30 a.m. Larry Drew, a former player and current assistant 
coach for the Lakers, will be on hand to support the players, along with Berman 
and Katz. 
</P>
<P>
 Four National Basketball Assn. referees will be working the championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of as many as 50 or 60 people have turned out to watch the preliminary 
games, Ledesma said, which he found encouraging. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just the beginning," Ledesma said, adding that he hoped to have more 
tournaments, the next one to be held within a few months. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the players are members of formerly rival gangs, but with a peace 
treaty that was forged a few months ago, that has not been a concern, Ledesma 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The tension comes from Latino and African American adults coming out of the 
prison system, telling youths that they should not associate with those of 
other races, Ledesma said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that he hopes the tournament will turn that trend around, but says it 
is too early to tell. 
</P>
<P>
 Also sponsoring the tournament is the Pacoima Community Youth Culture Center, 
the San Fernando Gardens Resident Advisory Council, the city Department of 
Recreation and Parks, and New Directions for Youth. ED BOND

<P>
 After an aftershock from the Northridge earthquake crippled their ability to 
serve the northeast San Fernando Valley, mental health care workers Friday 
officially dedicated the new San Fernando Mental Health Center in Mission 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels wonderful to be in the new building," said Dr. Alex Kopelowicz, 
medical director of the complex situated at 15535 San Fernando Mission Blvd."We 
were blown out of our old office after the earthquake. Now we not only serve 
more clients, we added innovative programs." 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony was marked by a ribbon-cutting featuring Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Ed Edelman, who spearheaded approval of the move in March. 
</P>
<P>
 The relocation to the new facility has been planned for about three years, 
said Miguel Rico, mental health analyst for the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The old location, a 6,100-square-foot office on 11479 San Fernando Road in San 
Fernando, was too small to accommodate group treatment programs and did not 
have enough parking, Rico said. The facility held about 30 social workers, 
psychiatrists and other professionals who treated chronically mentally ill 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
 But the situation became critical when the 5.3 aftershock on March 20 left the 
San Fernando Road complex red-tagged, forcing the workers to temporarily occupy 
the recreation center at San Fernando Park in April. 
</P>
<P>
 A few weeks later they moved intotwo trailers behind the San Fernando 
Municipal Courthouse on Macneil Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very frustrating," said Kopelowicz. "In our trailer, which was the 
size of an average living room, you had three doctors seeing patients right 
next to each other. You were whispering so you wouldn't interfere with anybody 
else's care." 
</P>
<P>
 The new site, a former medical center, is about twice the size of the old 
facility, Kopelowicz said, providing more space for more programs. JEFF

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; MEETING SCHEDULED ON VENTURA BLVD. PLANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Neon palm tree sculptures, bougainvillea-bedecked canopies and Art Deco street 
lights are featured in one of three proposals for re-landscaping Ventura 
Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposals will be presented for public comment at a community meeting 
Wednesday at Osaka Sangyo University. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will be conducted by the Ventura Boulevard Specific Plan Review 
Board starting at 7 p.m. After a second community meeting, the citizens 
advisory committee will submit a recommended "streetscape" plan to the Los 
Angeles Planning Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposals were designed independently by three architects, who nonetheless 
said their ideas are somewhat complementary because they have chosen to focus 
on different aspects of the landscape plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica architect Martin Gelber envisions an Art Deco look for the Studio 
City portion of the boulevard, a theme that would be carried through in new 
street lights, 30-foot-long shade canopies and building facades. 
Magenta-blossomed bougainvillea would festoon the canopies, which would be 
spaced at intervals along Ventura Boulevard. To highlight Studio City's 
identity as a center for the movie industry, Gelber would erect 25-foot-tall 
neon palm tree sculptures near the intersection of Ventura and Laurel Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Studio City architect Andrew Sussman is championing the idea of dividing 
Studio City into five districts concentrating on retail, media, car 
dealerships, transportation and the studios. Each district would have a 
distinct look, he said. Sussman also favors encouraging businesses to place 
signs no higher than their building height. The architect will present his 
proposal for redoing Ventura Place -- including diagonal parking and outdoor 
dining -- which he drew up as a showcase for his ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Studio City architect Simon Locke's proposal, trees, canopies and 
awnings would be added to create shade for pedestrians. Locke would like to 
develop the sprawling parking lot at the northwest corner of Ventura and Laurel 
Canyon, possibly with a movie theater and increased parking. 
</P>
<P>
 "My long-term objective is converting the L.A. River from its current status 
as a drainage ditch into a cultural resource," said Locke, who said he wants to 
add trees, shrubs and bike paths to the riverbank. KAY HWANGBO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; EVERY CENT COUNTS IN AN UNUSUAL FUND DRIVE

<P>
 Making an Easter Seals donation to Jack Kronenberg requires more than just 
writing a check. 
</P>
<P>
 Kronenberg plans to collect $5,000 for the charitable organization by October 
-- every cent of it in pennies. 
</P>
<P>
 That's 500,000 copper coins in all. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the vice president at Orange Coast Title Co. in Santa Ana has received 
370,000 pennies, which are neatly stacked in wrappers at his office. 
</P>
<P>
 Penny savers from throughout the county donated the coins, which have arrived 
in bags, Easter baskets, water bottles, coffee tins, flower vases and butter 
containers. 
</P>
<P>
 One man donated more than 40,000 pennies in a children's wagon. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have the eighth wonder of the world," Kronenberg said proudly. "It's all 
these pennies." 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual fund-raiser is based on the idea that people who hoard pennies are 
looking for a worthwhile place to deposit their collections. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks usually won't accept pennies unless they are counted and wrapped. "We 
found that the reason so many people have pennies lying around is because they 
are too lazy to wrap them," said Kronenberg, 60, of Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 He and other employees at Orange Coast Title gladly pick up and wrap the 
coins. They seek large collections but will accept almost any amount of coins, 
Kronenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 They once picked up a modest $6 worth of pennies from a Huntington Beach boy 
who wanted to make a contribution to Easter Seals, Kronenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes well, a Brinks truck will roll up to the title company office on 
Oct. 1 and pick up the $5,000 penny collection, which is expected to weigh 
three tons. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund-raiser coincides with the Eastern Seal's annual 24-hour relay race 
Oct. 8 and 9 at Cal State Los Angeles. SHELBY GRAD

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; KIDS DANCE TO FETE MEXICAN INDEPENDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a flurry of festive costumes and colorful, handmade decorations, the staff 
and students of O'Melveny Elementary School in San Fernando celebrated Mexican 
Independence Day on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The children showcased a Mexican dance that represented various stages of the 
country's history, from an Aztec ceremonial to a currently popular square 
dance. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Melveny, whose student body is 99% Latino, places a strong emphasis on 
multicultural studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Lucky Hemphill said the entire school is involved in an 
interdisciplinary "mixing" program in which the youngsters learn art, music, 
physical education and health. The first month of this year's program was 
devoted to Mexican history and culture, culminating in the Independence Day 
celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 Third- and fourth-graders at the school performed a folk dance called la rama 
, or the branch. Their teacher, Melody Dekel, helped her students make Mexican 
flags and maracas for the celebration and talked to them about the historical 
significance of the holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They learned about the independence from Spain using the analogy of the 
American Independence Day," Dekel said, who teaches her class in both Spanish 
and English. "We talked about what it would have felt like for the people of 
Mexico to gain their rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten-year-old Fabiola Ortiz said she made her maracas for la rama out of an 
empty milk carton. She filled her maracas with dried beans and decorated them 
with construction paper. "It's fun to do the dance," Fabiola said. "I practiced 
five days for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Adorned with multicolored headdresses they made themselves, some children 
portrayed the danza de los quetzalez , or the dance of the birds, an Aztec 
ceremonial dance to a god in the form of a feathered serpent, according to 
teacher Jean VanderHoff. 
</P>
<P>
 At the conclusion of the program, Hemphill led her students and faculty in a 
rousing cheer of 'Viva Mexico!' 
</P>
<P>
 Ana Feliciano, a parent who attended the show, said her son has been coming 
home telling her about the new dances he has learned at O'Melveny. "The kids 
love the music," Feliciano said. "That is the universal language." MAKI BECKER

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: DISTRICT LOSES OVER $9,000 IN HORSE SALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura County Community College District lost more than $9,000 after 
being forced to auction off 23 horses leftover from a defunct equine program, 
district records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month's auction netted about $11,000.But the district spent more than 
$20,000 preparing for the sale, consulting lawyers and investigating the 
program's former director. 
</P>
<P>
 And the costs are still piling up because officials plan to hold another 
public sale next month to dispose of four more horses owned by the college and 
discovered after the August auction was advertised. 
</P>
<P>
 Those horses are being boarded at Foxfield Riding Academy, the Thousand Oaks 
stable that bought the animals under a prior deal with Don Anderson, the equine 
program's former director. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, surplus public property must be sold to the highest bidder. 
</P>
<P>
 Records show the district spent more than $7,800 to care for the animals until 
they were sold. Taxpayers also spent $1,825 advertising the auction and 
appraising the animals, and more than $7,400 in legal bills, Chancellor Thomas 
G. Lakin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The district also paid private investigator William Hansen more than $3,100 
for a weeklong investigation into sales privately negotiated by Anderson, which 
were later voided by trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen's probe resulted in a three-page report to officials concluding that 
Anderson broke no laws. But Trustee Karen Boone was not pleased with Hansen's 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some aspects of the report that do not go deep enough," she said at 
Tuesday night's board meeting. "I was disappointed." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County district attorney's office dropped its investigation into 
the sales negotiated by Anderson after reading Hansen's report. JEFF McDONALD

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ROSSMOOR; RESIDENT MUST KEEP APHID-INFESTED TREE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Directors of the Rossmoor Community Services District have denied a request by 
a resident to remove an aphid-infested ash tree in front of his house. 
</P>
<P>
 The directors voted 3 to 1 Wednesday to deny Robert Quaid's request to cut 
down the tree, which he said has attracted aphids secreting a black, glue-like 
substance that has made the sidewalk in front of his Hedwig Road house slippery 
and dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trees are very important to this community," said John Hunt, president of the 
five- member board, which runs this unincorporated community. "The policy is 
not to cut down a tree unless it's dying." 
</P>
<P>
 Hunt, however, cast the lone vote against the motion to deny Quaid's request 
because he said it did not include a provision to buy equipment that could be 
loaned to residents seeking to wash the sticky substance from their driveways 
and sidewalks. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Joyce Bloom was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Quaid had told the directors he was worried he would be held liable if someone 
were to fall and get hurt after stepping on the substance, which sticks to the 
soles of shoes and is hard to remove. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of Quaid's neighbors on Hedwig Road have also complained to the district 
about the aphid droppings. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bill Sheldon, the district's general manager, said the problem is common 
in Southern California at this time of the year. He said that a county arborist 
determined the tree was healthy and there was no reason to remove it. He said 
that the aphid secretion is sticky, but not slippery, and can be washed off 
with soapy water. 
</P>
<P>
 Quaid said he is not against trees, only this particular tree. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's this love affair with this tree?" he asked. "I don't think that it's 
right that a tree is more important than the residents."A

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; SAILORS HURT IN FALL REMAIN 
HOSPITALIZED 
</P>

<P>
 Two sailors who fell five stories from an antenna at the Port Hueneme Seabee 
base remained in critical condition Friday while the Navy continued seeking the 
cause of the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 The petty officers, one of whom served in the Persian Gulf War, fell when the 
75-foot tower collapsed Thursday morning at the Naval Construction Battalion 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men had been preparing to do what base spokeswoman Linda Wadley called 
routine maintenance work on the military communications tower.  
</P>
<P>
 Steelworker 3rd Class Timothy MacTavish, 27, who served in Desert Storm and 
Desert Shield, remained in intensive care at St. John's Regional Medical Center 
in Oxnard, spokeswoman Karen Garner said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the Oxnard resident underwent extensive surgery for two compound leg 
fractures and a spinal cord injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Technician 3rd Class Richard Terry, 22, a Thousand Oaks resident, also 
remained in intensive care with severe facial and head injuries, Garner said.  
</P>
<P>
 According to witnesses, MacTavish was about 60 feet up the free-standing 
tower, strapped to its metal bars, when it began to fall, Gold Coast 
Ambulanceparamedic Jeff Muzzin said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Terry was climbing the rungs of the triangular tower at the time, 
about 10 feet below MacTavish, and that both tried to jump free.  
</P>
<P>
 Mike Dorey, 27, who is MacTavish's roommate off base, said the petty officer 
served in the Persian Gulf War and has been sent to Korea, Japan and Puerto 
Rico. 
</P>
<P>
 Wadley said the seven-year veteran received two medals for serving in the 
Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry, a four-year veteran whose fiancee lives in Thousand Oaks, also did 
maintenance work with MacTavish at an apartment complex off base, Dorey said.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: MAN CHARGED IN FIRE GETS NEW COURT DATE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The arraignment for a Camarillo man charged with sparking a 3,500-acre 
wildfire in Santa Barbara County was postponed Friday for the second time at 
his attorney's request. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Hanger, who teaches at Thousand Oaks High School, was cited in August 
with unlawfully causing a fire, a misdemeanor.Hanger turned himself in after 
realizing the fire in Aliso Canyon began the same day he had been rabbit 
hunting in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 After studying patterns of burnt grass, investigators with the Santa Barbara 
County Fire Department concluded that a cigarette discarded by Hanger was the 
likely cause of the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from a criminal charge, Hanger could be held liable for the cost of 
fighting the four-day fire that charred the remote backcountry. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the U.S. Forest Service earlier estimated the tab could be as 
high as $750,000, but the actual costs have not yet been calculated. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanger was represented in the Santa Maria courthouse on Friday by his 
attorney, John McGregor, who asked that the arraignment be continued. McGregor 
said he wants more time to discuss the matter with the Santa Barbara County 
district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The arraignment is now set for Oct. 16 in Santa Maria. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Hanger, 50, said he is simply trying to concentrate on his work and 
family until the matter is settled. JULIE FIELDS

<P>
 Write-in candidates planning to compete in local, state and federal races this 
fall have until Oct. 25 to file their nomination papers, county election 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The filing period for write-in candidates running in the Nov. 8 general 
election opened Monday, said Deputy County Clerk Olivia Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
 Write-in candidates fill out the same nomination forms as regular candidates 
but do not pay a filing fee, she said. As a result, their names do not appear 
on the ballot, but rather on a candidates' list distributed to each polling 
place on election day. 
</P>
<P>
 Write-in candidates can file nomination papers with the county registrar's 
office. Those seeking city council seats can file with city clerks. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the race, write-in candidates must collect a certain number of 
signatures of registered voters to qualify for the general election, Lopez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Robert Hamming of Ventura is the only write-in candidate to file 
nomination papers, Lopez said. Hamming is running for the U. S. Senate as an 
independent. The last day to register to vote this year is Oct. 11. CARLOS V.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO; BANK BUILDING SWITCH TO TIRE SHOP IS 
OKD 
</P>

<P>
 Over objections of nearby property owners, the Planning Commission this week 
approved the conversion of a bank building into a tire and brake shop. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel approved a plan Tuesday in a 3-1 vote that aims to make the business 
less conspicuous.The shop will be located amid retail shops and offices in the 
32000 block of Camino Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the conditions of approval were a wall to be built along Camino 
Capistrano and increased landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 Several property owners implored planning commissioners to deny the project, 
even though the use is allowed under the city's zoning code. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a very difficult issue," said Diane Bathgate, one of the members 
who voted to approve the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Cheryle Hodge said she supported the project but didn't feel it 
was the best use for the property, which was once a Security Pacific Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry Kumagai, the property's owner, told the panel he had spent considerable 
money and time trying to design a business that would be sensitive to the 
surrounding area but not an impossible one from which to work. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the city's approval, the business, Goodyear Tire Center, must use 
the most advanced air wrenches available to reduce noise and close its doors 
during service operations. JEFF BEAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; NEW BILLS BAFFLE WATER CONSUMERS 
</P>

<P>
 Mass confusion is how city officials have described the impact of new water 
bills designed to distribute water costs more evenly throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has been inundated with telephone calls since the new monthly bills 
were sent out in July, said City Manager Michael W. Parness. Some residents 
have complained that their bills have skyrocketed as much as 150%. 
</P>
<P>
 To better explain the billing system, a citywide mailer has been prepared and 
will be sent with the monthly water bills next week, Parness said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been a significant number of changes and a significant number of 
problems with the new system," Parness said. "We had public hearings, but (the 
new system) is complex, and it's difficult to understand." 
</P>
<P>
 The new system, which now bills water users monthly instead of bimonthly, was 
the result of a lengthy city study meant to better distribute the costs of 
operating the city water system, Greg Morehead, the city's utility manager, 
said at a recent council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The system includes a new, tiered rate structure designed to increase charges 
to the larger water users and a new monthly billing for storm drain work that 
used to be billed semiannually, Morehead said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's complicated because we attempted to make it more fair," Morehead said. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding to the problem is last October's 20% increase in wholesale water rates 
charged to the city, which has been passed on to consumers, Morehead said. But 
no one's bill should have gone up by 100% or more, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are going to be increases to some and some decreases to others, but at 
no time did I think it would be a 100% increase," Morehead said. "There should 
be a 10% to 15% increase for the average consumer." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Scott Diehl urged residents to be patient and said all the glitches in 
the new system will be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have Solomon's wisdom. We're doing the best job we can," Diehl said.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; POLICE SET PUBLIC MEETING ON RAISING 
BURGLAR ALARM FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents and business owners with alarm systems will have a chance Wednesday 
to voice their concerns at the Police Department about a city plan to raise 
response fees to recoup the cost of answering false alarms. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Robert J. McDonell told the City Council this week that false 
alarms make up 99% of all alarm responses, demanding 9.6% of police officers' 
work time.He said the cost is difficult to quantify, but it could be as high as 
$1.8 million a year -- 9.6% of the police budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most cities, Newport Beach continues to monitor its 732 private alarms 
directly at the Police Department; it would continue to do so, but residents 
with alarms installed would have to pay more.  
</P>
<P>
 Alarm permits that cost $50 and do not expire would cost residents $25 every 
three years and businesses $30 a year if the plan is approved. Monthly 
monitoring fees would rise from $12.50 to $18. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed changes are also designed to reduce the number of false alarms by 
increasing false alarm fines and spending $22,571 to install better monitoring 
equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The city doesn't charge for the first and second false alarms in a calendar 
year, but the fee is $50, $100 and $125 for each subsequent false alarm. The 
plan would shift the annual fine cycle from a calendar year to a year from the 
date of the first false alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the department's request is for $20,500 for better software for the 
police and finance computers.  
</P>
<P>
 The City Council plans a public hearing on the fee hike for Sept. 26.HOLLY J.

<P>
 The governing board of the Rancho Santiago College District has approved a 
1994-95 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Trustees this week approved the plan on a 5-2 vote, with Trustees 
Charles W. (Pete) Maddox, Brian Conley, Lawrence Labrado, Enriqueta Ramos and 
Michael Ortell supporting it and Trustees Shirley Ralston and Tom Saenz 
opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralston and Saenz said the board had not sufficiently discussed several new 
expenditures added to the budget since reviewing a tentative draft in June. 
</P>
<P>
 The $69.6-million spending plan calls for no major changes in the numbers of 
courses offered or staffing levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the state's continuing economic problems, district financial officials 
said they expect the state to withhold $1.9 million of the district's money. As 
a result, the district budget includes a projected deficit of $2.65 million for 
the 1994-95 fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Ralston did not specifically challenge the expenditures recently 
added to the final draft, she complained that the board was rushing to approve 
a budget whose components had not been adequately debated. JON NALICK

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; CSUN NOW OFFERING LOW-COST COUNSELING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Low-cost therapy sessions for individuals, families and groups are now 
available through a community counseling center at Cal State Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The counseling will be conducted by students in the master's degree program of 
CSUN's educational psychology and counseling department and supervised by 
faculty members. 
</P>
<P>
 The center had been scheduled to offer a full range of counseling session 
beginning in January. But because of the Northridge earthquake, it began 
providing free post-traumatic stress therapy for earthquake victims who live in 
the neighborhoods surrounding the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "This semester we are gearing up to getting together with (the Los Angeles 
Unified School District) on approaching all of the 47 schools in the area and 
reaching out to all of those schools . . . to help them with post-traumatic 
stress," said Estee Diamond, program coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the summer, Diamond said, student counselors have worked with 
children and adults whose mental health has yet to return to pre-quake 
normality. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are still calling us; they are having trouble sleeping and are unable 
to continue in their jobs," Diamond said.  
</P>
<P>
 The counselors also have helped people who are depressed, do not feel safe 
because of the quake and suffer from somatic symptoms such as headaches. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to quake-related therapy, the center will start providing 
counseling for individuals on personal development and social/relationship 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants will pay for the therapy on a sliding scale based on their 
financial situations. For more information about quake counseling, call (800) 
854-7771. For general counseling, call (818) 885-2568. MAKI BECKER

 The City Council voted this week to ban all adult businesses from opening 
within 250 feet of schools, playgrounds and churches. An additional provision 
of the law would prohibit them from doing business within 275 feet of any 
residential neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Topless and nude bars, theaters, book and video stores, and other sexually 
oriented businesses -- including hotels -- now may open only in a few 
commercial and industrial zones throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law also bars such establishments from opening within 150 of each 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is our best foot forward to keep La Habra a nice place to live," Mayor 
David M. Cheverton said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said uncontrolled adult businesses are detrimental to residents 
and other businesses located near them. In a report to the City Council, city 
staffers found that crime rates are higher in areas where such businesses 
operate. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also stated the image of the city "as a pleasant and attractive 
place to reside will be adversely affected by the presence of adult businesses 
in close proximity to" neighborhoods, churches, schools and parks. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance takes effect next month. 
</P>
<P>
 It does not replace a 300-day moratorium on issuing permits for nude-dancing 
entertainment. That moratorium will expire in November. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members imposed the moratorium after they were told that some 
businesses planned to apply for permits in the city.MIMI KO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; FEW FIRMS SEND IN ANTI-POLLUTION TIPS

<P>
 After what appeared to be a promising start, a Newport Beach committee's drive 
to get businesses to swap pollution-reducing tips has generated little 
response, prompting proponents to try another approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Hepner, a business consultant heading the "Newport Green" program 
undertaken by the city's Environmental Quality Affairs Committee, said just a 
few businesses sent responses to a letter that went out to 2,700 Chamber of 
Commerce members in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Hepner said one key businessman told him that others had looked at the letter 
but were wary of replying out of fear of being criticized for not doing enough. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter solicited tips on reducing waste and recycling or trading 
byproducts. Proponents hoped that if some companies saw that recycling saved 
them money, others would follow the example. The campaign does not involve 
penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're now contacting businesses directly," Hepner said. "Some of them are 
still reluctant because they're afraid that somebody will take a potshot at 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Hepner said he hopes a city proclamation declaring next week "Pollution 
Prevention Week" will kindle some interest. 
</P>
<P>
 "In asking why and seeing what we learn, we find that maybe our methodology 
was wrong," he said. "This is not a short-term project. I think we're going to 
learn more as we give it some time." HOLLY J. WAGNER

<P>
 Preliminary plans for an 879-acre development on the city's northern border 
were unanimously approved this week by the Planning Commission.  
</P>
<P>
 The five-member commission approved the plan with one small but significant 
change: Traffic from the estimated 2,300 new homes in the development will no 
longer use Prospect Avenue as a major route in and out of the area, but will 
instead travel primarily on Valley View and Lakeview avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 The change was in response to concerns about traffic from residents who live 
off Prospect just south of the project area. Initial plans for the development 
would have extended Prospect north into the new neighborhoods, connecting with 
Lakeview and serving as a likely route in and out of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, city officials have agreed to prevent Prospect from becoming a heavily 
traveled street, possibly by making it a cul-de-sac at Lakeview instead of an 
intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 The approval by the Planning Commission is the first of several hurdles the 
project must clear before the landowner, Shell Oil, can begin development. The 
commission and the City Council still must approve agreements covering what the 
project will look like and on development of a golf course and parks. 
Annexation of the unincorporated land must be approved by the Local Agency 
Formation Commission.DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

 In the 1880s, county residents argued endlessly about what to name the area, 
according to the book "100 Years of Yesterdays." 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim leaders wanted "Anaheim County."Santa Ana residents liked "Santa Ana 
County" -- even though one critic said the name could be confused with "Satanic 
County," "Santanna" or "Santy Annie." Both cities also vied to be the county 
seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in 1889, the area agreed to name the county after its most important 
crop, the orange. But even that name met with initial opposition from some who 
felt it ignored the area's thriving grape and livestock farms. Today

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: NEWBURY PARK; CHUMASH POWWOW PRESERVES TRADITION

<P>
 Bringing an ancient Chumash tradition to life, the California Indian Council 
will hold its sixth annual powwow today and Sunday at Borchard Community Center 
in Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, a private, nonprofit group that seeks to preserve Native American 
tradition, invites the public to attend the event from 9 a.m. to 10 p.m. today 
and from 10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Sunday at 190 N. Reino Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Dancing, drumming and the jewelry and crafts of Native American artisans will 
be featured, as will games and food such as Navajo tacos and fry bread. 
</P>
<P>
 Native American dancers will compete for prizes, and items donated by local 
merchants and craftsmen will be raffled off. 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance at the event, which will be held in cooperation with the Conejo 
Recreation and Parks District, is free. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before the Spanish set foot in Ventura County, the Chumash and other 
local tribes -- the Gabrielino and the Miwok -- would meet to celebrate the 
fall harvest, said council President Richard Angulo. Acorns, pine cones, sage 
and other products were gathered at that time in preparation for winter, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The powwow, a term derived from the Cherokee word for "gathering for peace," 
re-enacts this. GREG RIPPEE

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; BOARD CONTRACT OFFER OMITS TEACHER RAISE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Responding to a demand from teachers for a new contract, Moorpark school 
officials have submitted an offer to the union that -- to the dismay of union 
representatives -- does not include a pay raise. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers in the Moorpark Unified School District had sought a 4% pay increase 
in an offer submitted to the board last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the language in the contract was everything (the union) wanted, but 
the one thing that they really wanted wasn't in there and that is money," board 
member Tom Baldwin said Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 The teachers union has already staged two protests, including pickets on the 
first day of school at six of the district's nine schools, and a picket at the 
school board meeting Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're real tired of doing this," said union President Richard Gillis at the 
meeting. More than 60 teachers packed the meeting, holding signs with slogans 
such as "Moorpark, Home of 256 Unhappy Teachers." 
</P>
<P>
 Gillis lambasted the board Tuesday night for not negotiating with the union 
sooner. But board members responded that the union rejected an offer last 
spring for a three-year contract that would have covered the two previous 
school years as well as this school year. SCOTT HADLY

<P>
 To reduce the amount of trash going from Moorpark to landfills, the city is 
encouraging residents to let their organic waste rot in easy-to-maintain 
compost bins. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has about 100 bins it is offering them to residents for $15.The bins 
often cost $99 in stores, according to Jill Rubin Myers, Moorpark's solid waste 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Composting yard clippings and food scraps can reduce the trash produced in a 
year from one household by nearly a third of a ton, Myers said. 
</P>
<P>
 The composting bins allow trash to biodegrade with little or no odor into a 
fertile soil amendment that can be used in the garden or for house plants, 
Myers said.  
</P>
<P>
 The bins will be on sale Oct. 1 at Moorpark Country Days. A free book on 
composting is included in the offer.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; 'QUINN' TO STAY AT PARAMOUNT RANCH SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Buoyed by the success of its popular TV show "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman," 
filmed at the Paramount Ranch in a rural area south of Agoura Hills, CBS 
Entertainment Productions has signed a five-year agreement with the National 
Park Service to continue filming at the ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS officials, representatives of the Park Service and the show's star, Jane 
Seymour, celebrated the agreement with a reception Friday at the historic 
movie-making site in the Santa Monica Mountains National Recreation Area, a 
unit of the Park Service. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranch, according to the Park Service, has been used for location filming 
since 1927, when Paramount Studios purchased its 2,700 acres. The Park Service 
acquired the land in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramount Ranch is also the site for numerous non-film events, including the 
Calabasas Days Pumpkin Festival, which takes place in late October. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a wonderful place to be able to work, in the unspoiled wilderness of the 
Santa Monica Mountains," said Seymour, who plays Dr. Michaela Quinn on the 
show. "And it's very convenient, it's within minutes of the city." 
</P>
<P>
 CBS renovated an old meeting hall and mill at the site, according to Tim 
Johnson, the show's producer. The production unit now uses the meeting hall as 
an office and the mill has been made into a shop for set construction. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS spent about $650,000 on the renovations and the building of a school house 
and church in an old Western town at the site, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The show's producers had originally considered filming in Colorado but changed 
their minds after they saw Paramount Ranch, said Andrew Hill, president of CBS 
Entertainment Productions. They were attracted by area's wide-open spaces and 
its close proximity to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obviously a lot easier to stay in town, for all the actors, because they 
don't have to uproot their families," Hill said. "And this show looks as good 
as any show on TV, and it's shot right here in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 The site is open seven days a week to the public from dawn to dusk. As part of 
the agreement, the studio allows the public onto the ranch during filming, but 
visitors can be sequestered from certain areas so that filming can proceed 
without interference. 
</P>
<P>
 One benefit to the Park Service is that the renovations make the ranch more 
attractive to visitors, said David E. Gackenbach, superintendent of the Santa 
Monica Mountains National Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 The area near the ranch benefits, too, according to Patti Archuletta, director 
of the California Film Commission. Officials at the state agency said that the 
"Dr. Quinn" film crew spends about $460,000 a year locally on lumber, gasoline, 
food and other items. FRANK MANNING

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; WHISTLE-BLOWER GETS $350,000 SETTLEMENT 
</P>

<P>
 An engineer who claimed he was demoted and eventually fired by a Burbank 
aerospace firm for blowing the whistle on fraudulent testing practices has won 
a $350,000 settlement from the company. 
</P>
<P>
 A Glendale Superior Court jury agreed this week with Sohrab Haroonian's claim 
that he was improperly terminated in 1990 by Elmo Semiconductor Corp., a firm 
that makes and tests parts for defense contractors and manufacturers of medical 
devices such as pacemakers and heart valves. Haroonian had worked for the 
company for four years. 
</P>
<P>
 Haroonian, a senior test engineer, claimed in his lawsuit that he was ordered 
on numerous occasions to write false reports saying that parts had passed 
inspections when they actually had not, said his attorney, Cynthia Hafif. "His 
supervisors would also change test reports so as to conceal defective parts. He 
also witnessed or was advised of instances where parts were improperly disposed 
of after failing tests, precluding the ability to conduct failure analysis on 
these parts," Hafif said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hafif said Haroonian reported the incidents to the company's management but no 
action was taken. Eventually, he was demoted to the inventory department and 
later fired. 
</P>
<P>
 But Paul Lax, an attorney for Elmo Semiconductor, said the firm will appeal 
the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 Lax said he spoke to jurors after the verdict was handed down, and he believes 
they may have ruled in Haroonian's favor even though "they did not find fraud, 
and they did not find illegal activities had taken place." 
</P>
<P>
 "They did, however, find that Mr. Haroonian believed something was going on. 
He erroneously believed that," Lax said. He said the case wrongly indicates 
that juries can award damages to fired workers who "see a conspiracy behind 
every bush." 
</P>
<P>
 Lax also said he believes "hearsay evidence" was admitted during the trial, 
and the company will ask that the case be retried. 
</P>
<P>
 Haroonian's attorneys had asked the court for $1.6 million in financial 
damages, plus unspecified payment for emotional distress and punitive damages. 
The jury's award consisted of $200,000 in lost wages and $150,000 for emotional 
distress. STEVE RYFLE

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; GTE TO CUT 350 JOBS, CONSOLIDATE 
OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 GTE California will cut about 350 hourly jobs and reduce its contract 
positions as part of an ongoing job consolidation, company officials announced 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The reductions, which will affect clerical and some technical positions, will 
be made statewide through attrition, buyouts and layoffs, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has almost become business as usual at our company," said Larry Cox, 
manager of public affairs for the Thousand Oaks-based company. "We have been 
downsizing for several years."  
</P>
<P>
 GTE California, a subsidiary of the Stamford, Conn.-based GTE Corp., employs 
about 10,074 hourly workers. The communications company serves about 3.1 
million customers in 330 communities in California. The cutbacks will not be 
concentrated in any one community, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 The reduction of positions is largely driven by competition and technological 
advances that allow the company to operate with fewer people, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The benefits of technology are allowing us to do a better job with less 
employees," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, as of Jan. 1, 1995, the company will begin to compete with about 
100 companies vying for a lucrative market in long-distance telephone service, 
Cox said. 
</P>
<P>
 The last day of work for GTE employees who have not found other positions 
within the company or accepted one of two buyout packages will be Nov. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of layoffs will depend on how many employees can be transferred to 
open positions and how many take buyouts. "We probably won't know for a couple 
of weeks what the bottom line will be," Cox said. TRACY WILSON

SCHOOL BOARD BACKS CLOSURE OF STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gearing up for the November election, the Ventura Unified School District 
board has taken a stand against a ballot measure aimed at reopening the section 
of Poli Street at Ventura High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The board voted unanimously this week for a resolution opposing Measure E. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, trustees agreed to continue negotiating with the 
hillside residents who vehemently oppose the street's closure and who pushed to 
get Measure E on the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The board also decided to investigate the cost of building an overpass on Poli 
Street with a walkway underneath so that Ventura High students can cross from 
one side of campus to the other. Measure E backers have proposed the overpass 
as an alternative to keeping the street closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure E, which will go before Ventura voters Nov. 8, calls for reversing the 
City Council's decision last year to close the section of Poli Street that cuts 
through the high school campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Police barricades keep motorists off the street between Catalina Drive and 
Hall Canyon Road from 7:30 a.m. to about 3:45 p.m. on school days. The council 
closed Poli Street in response to school safety concerns that arose after the 
murder of Ventura High student Jesse Strobel early last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Strobel was killed off campus after school hours, school and city 
officials said that closing the street would increase student safety by keeping 
outsiders off campus. School officials now say the closure has made the campus 
safer and quieter. 
</P>
<P>
 But hillside residents have fought the move, arguing that the closure has 
increased traffic on residential streets and endangered their lives by making 
it more difficult for emergency vehicles to reach their homes. MAIA DAVIS

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: AGOURA HILLS; SHELL OIL GETS OK TO BUILD CARWASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Agoura Hills Planning Commission has agreed to let Shell Oil Co. build a 
carwash and mini-mart at its station on Kanan Road in exchange for voluntarily 
removing its 70-foot pole sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Many local businesses refuse to abide by the controversial 9-year-old city 
ordinance banning pole signs and have sued the city. 
</P>
<P>
 But Shell representatives say they want to settle the issue amicably. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to create a win-win situation for the city and for Shell," 
Larry Turner, an area real estate representative for the company, told the 
commission before its vote Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner said Shell believes the agreement makes more sense economically, 
because it would avoid costly lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell officials are hoping the added revenue generated by the carwash and 
mini-mart will make up for an anticipated 30% drop in business when the sign 
comes down, but there are no guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of freewayl signs say such pole signs are unsightly and spoil the 
scenery, while many business people who have the signs say they would lose much 
of their business from the freeway if the signs came down. 
</P>
<P>
 When the city banned pole signs nine years ago, it gave owners seven years to 
remove them. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters that November backed the ordinance by a 3-1 ratio. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten businesses -- Chevron, Unocal, McDonald's, Texaco, Burger King, Denny's, 
Jack In The Box, Lumber City, Roadside Lumber and Fence Factory -- filed 
separate lawsuits against the city in May. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, a community group in Agoura Hills led a boycott against the 
businesses. Some of the businesses declared the boycott a failure and vowed to 
continue their fight to keep the signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Jackson, executive director of the Malibu-based Sign Users' Council of 
California, which has been fighting against sign ordinances, said he had mixed 
feelings about the city's agreement with Shell. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to wish Shell Oil all the success with what they did," he said. "But 
we would like to have Shell Oil come back a year from now and tell us if they 
are happy. If a carwash and food mart will create more revenue than a freeway 
sign, then we are very happy for them." 
</P>
<P>
 He said his organization will continue working to help business people who 
want to keep their pole signs. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Jackson credited the group with helping to defeat Assembly 
Bill 487, sponsored by the city of Agoura Hills, which would have strengthened 
the city's ordinance against pole signs. FRANK MANNING

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; EVICTED MAN SOUGHT IN BUILDING DAMAGE

<P>
 A businessman who was being evicted for failing to pay rent on a two-story 
meeting hall apparently took revenge on his landlord by trashing the building 
and causing an estimated $250,000 in damage, Glendale police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators were still dusting for fingerprints late Friday in the defiled 
interior of Stevens Hall, 701 S. Central Ave., and would not immediately 
release the name of the person they were seeking for questioning. But they said 
the man who rented the facility, which consists of two banquet halls, a kitchen 
and other rooms, is the "prime suspect" in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's extensive damage throughout the bottom floor," police spokesman Rod 
Brooks said. "Floor tiles were torn up with hammer blows, walls were literally 
knocked down, the drywall has holes punched in it, and some major commercial 
kitchen appliances have been stolen." 
</P>
<P>
 Acid had also been poured on the carpets, and the Fire Department's hazardous 
materials unit was called in to neutralize the substance, Brooks said.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the items stolen were a piano, a restaurant-style food preparation table 
and six antique chairs worth $20,000 each. The chairs are owned by a local 
Masonic Temple chapter and were stored on the property for meetings, police 
said. An air-conditioning unit was also pulled out of the wall and stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of the building, Harout Yepremian, could not be reached for comment, 
but police said Yepremian and the tenant had apparently been involved in a 
dispute over back rent and the tenant was due to be evicted from the building 
Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 But when a member of the Yepremian family went to the building early Friday to 
see whether the building had been vacated, the front entrance was unlocked and 
the damage was discovered, according to the police report.  
</P>
<P>
 Police said there were no witnesses to the crime and they are not sure exactly 
when the damage was done, although it was believed to have been within the last 
two days. STEVE RYFLE

seeking to inspire other Latinos to excel in school and achieve success in life 
by building self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got such an inferior education that we don't want our youths to go through 
what we went through," said Zuniga, who lives in Placentia. "Because of the 
poor schooling we got, we thought we were dumb, and it's sad that we received 
that kind of treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Wilson School alumni will gather for a reunion to reminisce about their 
experiences and share strategies for continuing to strengthen community 
volunteer work. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson opened in 1919 and was razed in 1950. It was known as the "Mexican 
school"; classrooms were in old barracks brought from the Army Air Corps base 
in Costa Mesa to the school site on 2nd and California streets. The playgrounds 
consisted of dirt fields that eventually were replaced with condominiums and 
Portola Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Zuniga's older brother, Alfredo Zuniga, who also attended Wilson, said the 
school was little match for Lincoln Grammar School across town. Lincoln, which 
also opened in 1919, greeted students with a new brick schoolhouse, emerald 
playing fields and tennis courts. 
</P>
<P>
 White students went to Lincoln; the children of Latino farm workers who lived 
in the nearby Campo Colorado and Alta Vista neighborhoods went to Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra residents had passed a $90,000 school bond to build both Wilson and 
Lincoln, but only $15,000 went to Wilson, said the elder Zuniga, who is the 
town's oral historian. More than $75,000 was used to build Lincoln. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole school was Mexican American -- 100%. It was definitely a segregated 
school," said Candelario J. Mendoza, 75, the first Mexican American teacher 
hired in La Habra in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no bilingual instruction for the Spanish-speaking students. Only 
English was spoken, under the theory that children had to learn it to get good 
jobs, Mendoza said. He agreed with the theory but said it "was a shame" that 
Spanish was not allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I locked the door when I spoke Spanish with my students," Mendoza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporal punishment was allowed then and some teachers used it to cow 
Spanish-speaking students, but Mendoza chose not to. "It was left up to the 
discretion of the teacher," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfredo Zuniga remembers how he and his schoolmates -- many of whom worked 
alongside their parents in Orange County citrus groves picking oranges and 
lemons -- were required to shower before entering the classroom. "We were dirty 
Mexicans to them (white teachers and administrators) and had to take showers 
whether we had lice or not." 
</P>
<P>
 He vividly recalls being slapped, paddled and whipped for speaking Spanish and 
often being told to go to the store to buy treats for teachers or milk for the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always thought I was stupid because I never learned anything in that 
school," he said. "I missed classes because I was sent to the store." 
</P>
<P>
 But years later, Zuniga, who still lives in La Habra, opened a barber shop and 
gave himself an education by reading. He went to college and received a 
master's degree in library science. Today, he works as a librarian in Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Zuniga compiled the history of La Habra on audiotapes, which are available at 
Cal State Fullerton, and presently is writing a book about the city's 
beginnings so Latinos "will know that Mexicans contributed to the development 
of Orange County and to promote pride in the Mexican culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Zunigas, Ray Molina, 55, has similar bittersweet memories of Wilson 
that, he said, moved him to do something for Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Molina and his cousin, Dave Martinez, began teaching boxing to neighborhood 
youths in Molina's garage 13 years ago. In 1992, they persuaded the La Habra 
City Council to let them open the city's only boxing club in the former site of 
Our Lady of Guadalupe Church on Hillcrest Avenue. They continue to operate the 
club to instill self-esteem and to offer an alternative to gangs, Molina said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't remember learning anything at Wilson," said Molina, 55. "I do 
remember getting slapped and hit with a ruler for speaking Spanish and feeling 
like a second-class citizen. That's not right." 
</P>
<P>
 Segregation officially was phased out with a victorious court case against 
several Orange County school districts, paving the way for integration in 
schools throughout the county, retired teacher Mendoza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Wilson alumni now laugh about some of their experiences, they said they 
don't want other children ever to go through them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very aggravating and depressing at Wilson," Enrique Zuniga said. "Our 
English was very limited and the only way we could communicate was in Spanish 
and if we did, we would get punished. So we seldom spoke in class." 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking up is what another Wilson graduate, Sally Flores, now teaches 
teen-age girls who drop out of school. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores, 65, works with troubled youths and their parents in an effort to get 
them to value education by counseling them at her home. She also sits in on 
bilingual classes in the city of Buena Park to make sure students are 
encouraged to prosper. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Wilson alumni also are involved with their communities. John and Janet 
DiFranco, for example, feed homeless people in La Habra on weekends while 
others have organized sports leagues. Some offer to help people find housing, 
legal services and health care. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back in the Wilson years, no one did anything for us," Flores said. "So we 
want to be there for young Latinos who need help and encouragement." 
</P>
<P>
 Alumni still boast about former Wilson students who became well-known 
successes. They include Cruz Reynoso, who became a state Supreme Court justice, 
Luis H. Zuniga (an older brother of the Zunigas), who became the first Mexican 
American elected to the La Habra City Council, and Jesse Flores, the first 
Mexican American pitcher in the major leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are considering renaming a portion of Portola Park after Flores 
(who died in 1991) because he spent his off-season time at that park developing 
baseball programs for local youths and adults. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilson School reunion will be celebrated from 1 to 6 p.m. today at the 
Scout Hut, with mariachi music, motivational speakers, Mexican food and poetry 
readings. About 300 people are expected. The public is invited and the cost is 
$7.50. All proceeds will fund scholarships for college-bound students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Adversity forced these kids to overcome all kinds of obstacles," Mendoza said 
of his former students. "Now they're helping others. That's very admirable."

POLICE IDENTIFY BODY OF SLAIN MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police have identified a bullet-riddled body found Aug. 8 near a construction 
site as that of a 19-year-old Santa Ana man. 
</P>
<P>
 Gustavo Hernandez's burned and partially decomposed body was found in the area 
of Diamante and Calle Fino Clarete by two people searching for a lost animal.He 
had been shot several times in the chest, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez's 19-year-old girlfriend, whose identity was not released by police, 
last saw him Aug. 4 and reported him missing to Santa Ana police on Sept. 5, 
according to Orange County Sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini. 
</P>
<P>
 After newspapers published a police composite drawing of the victim the 
girlfriend contacted the Sheriff's Department to say it resembled Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez was then identified through a thumbprint from his California 
identification papers supplied by his family, police said.

EX-LAPD OFFICIAL FINED, PUT ON PROBATION; CRIME: DANIEL R. SULLIVAN ADMITTED 
THAT HE ILLEGALLY HAD POLICE INFORMATION IN HIS POSSESSION AS A PRIVATE 
DETECTIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former LAPD Deputy Chief Daniel R. Sullivan, once considered a top contender 
for the chief's job, pleaded no contest Friday to illegally possessing 
confidential law enforcement information as a private detective and was 
sentenced to a year's probation. 
</P>
<P>
 He became the highest ranking former LAPD official sentenced on criminal 
charges since the corruption scandals of the early 1900s. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Court Judge Veronica Simmons McBeth also fined Sullivan $4,995. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an appropriate plea given the circumstances," said Deputy District Atty. 
Alan Yochelson. "It's a significant fine and the publicity that this case has 
gathered will serve as a deterrent in future situations." 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan's attorney was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan, who last June pleaded not guilty to 11 counts and denied any 
wrongdoing, pleaded no contest to five misdemeanor counts, said Sandi Gibbons, 
of the Los Angeles County district attorney's office. No contest is the 
equivalent of a guilty plea for California criminal court purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors accused Sullivan and Thomas Whiteaker, of Whiteaker Investigative 
Services in Mission Hills, of receiving confidential information contained in 
law enforcement files from Walter Ray Bentley Jr., an LAPD officer who resigned 
last year after he was arrested on child pornography charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Yochelson alleged that Bentley used LAPD computers to get information on 
people -- including witnesses in criminal cases -- and then passed the 
information along to Sullivan and Whiteaker. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview last June, Yochelson told The Times that Whiteaker received 
information on a murder witness who had been relocated for his protection and 
on actor Todd Bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 The charges against Sullivan reflect the increased concern by police 
executives and prosecutors over LAPD officers selling or giving confidential 
information to private detectives. 
</P>
<P>
 The concern was heightened by a scandal in the 1980s involving the LAPD's 
Public Disorder Intelligence Division, which was disbanded after city officials 
learned that a detective kept some confidential dossiers at home and shared 
them with ultra-conservative groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Bunco detectives had investigated Sullivan for more than a year because of his 
alleged connections to Bentley. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago, hidden cameras recorded Bentley, a veteran Juvenile Division 
officer, getting requests from the two private investigation companies, 
checking almost 500 names against LAPD computers and then relaying that 
information to Sullivan and Whiteaker, according to search warrants filed in 
the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he retired from the department eight years ago, Sullivan had a 
widespread reputation as an energetic, capable, untouchably honest officer who 
was widely admired and at one point was considered a candidate to succeed 
former Chief Daryl F. Gates. 
</P>
<P>
 Yochelson said separate cases against Bentley and Whiteaker are still pending.

VULTURES TAKE LIKING TO TREES IN MALL LOT; THOUSAND OAKS: THE SCAVENGER BIRDS 
ROOST IN BRANCHES OF EUCALYPTUSES AT THE OAKS AND CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 They have small heads, large wings and love to dine on rotting flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 And these days you can find them hanging out at The Oaks mall and the Thousand 
Oaks Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 They're turkey vultures. 
</P>
<P>
 Several months ago, a flock of the scavenger birds began roosting in the tall 
eucalyptus trees that line the parking lot at the mall and the chamber across 
the street. 
</P>
<P>
 No one is sure what attracted the eagle-sized birds, named for their bare, 
red-skinned turkey-like heads. But whatever the reason, the buzzards seem to be 
quite happy with their new home. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're huge, and they're pretty ugly," said Barbara Teuscher, general 
manager of The Oaks. "I'm not sure what their food supply is. We don't 
typically have a lot of dead carcasses floating around in our parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Some people have taken sympathy on the vultures, which number about a 
half-dozen. Teuscher said a mall security guard caught an elderly woman about 
three months ago feeding the birds raw meat in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "She seemed to like vultures," Teuscher said. "I guess she thought they needed 
help. It's like people who go to Westlake Lake and feed the ducks. I think she 
thought she was being a Good Samaritan to the wild animals of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The vultures have also become a common sight across the street from the mall 
on Hillcrest Drive near the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Gaddess, a chamber official, said the vultures usually start flying in by 
late afternoon and evening. He said he has seen as many as 30 to 40 at one 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the winter I used to watch them come in every evening," he said. "They fly 
in from all over. It's amazing to see. They come in and do a few circles around 
the trees and land. Then they clean their wings and settle in for the night. 
They just hang out, and do their vulture thing." 
</P>
<P>
 During the day, the vultures fly up into the hills and surrounding mountains 
to eat, Gaddess said. But on some days, he said, they can be seen sailing in 
broad circles high above the chamber or mall area, searching for food. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they eat road kill, and there are a ton of squirrels around here," 
Gaddess said. "They leave their droppings in our parking lot. I've seen bones, 
snails and hair. So they're munching out." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their menacing looks and reputation, Gaddess said he believed the 
vultures are shy, graceful creatures that provide a valuable service by feeding 
on dead animals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love them," he said. "I think they're cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Weitzel, an official with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service office in 
Ventura, said turkey vultures are the most common type of vultures in the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're very well acclimated to the urban world," he said. "So it's not 
unusual at all to have them roost in trees near urbanization, especially around 
concrete buildings. They would not be there if they didn't feel comfortable and 
safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Weitzel said the vultures are not an endangered species, but like most wild 
birds are protected under federal law. Anyone caught killing a turkey vulture 
faces a maximum penalty of up to one year in jail or a $10,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "So you can't go out and shoot one," Weitzel said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Teuscher said mall officials are trying to figure out how to shoo 
away the vultures. While the vultures do not bother customers, she said they do 
make a "heck of a mess" in the parking lot with their large droppings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fortunately, they do not hang out in areas typically where people are 
walking," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teuscher said there are plans to prune the trees in the mall parking lot to 
make them less attractive to the vultures. She said the mall's landscape 
supervisor has also purchased some fake owls that workers will install in the 
trees to try to scare the birds away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping they go over to the Chamber of Commerce permanently," Teuscher 
joked. "But I don't hold out much hope. I guess we just have to live with them 
until they decide to move on someplace else."

MAN, 26, LOSES ARM WHEN STRUCK BY AMTRAK TRAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 26-year-old Simi Valley man lost his arm and suffered other major injuries 
after he was struck by an Amtrak train Friday night, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 James Strout and a friend were walking near the railroad tracks along Los 
Angeles Avenue in Simi Valley around 8 p.m., when Strout crouched down near the 
path of an approaching train about 100 feet east of Sequoia Avenue, Ventura 
County Fire Department officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently he was with a friend walking down the track and made the 
statement, 'Watch this,' and sat next to rails," said Capt. Jim Arledge, whose 
station answered the call. "The train struck him." 
</P>
<P>
 Strout's friend tried to get him to move away from the tracks when he saw the 
approaching train, but Strout refused, Police Lt. Ken Tacke said. Both men had 
been drinking, Tacke said. 
</P>
<P>
 The eastbound Amtrak passenger train was traveling about 50 to 60 m.p.h. when 
it sideswiped Strout, amputating his arm, Tacke said. Strout, who also suffered 
major head injuries, was taken to Simi Valley Hospital, where he was in 
critical condition late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were investigating whether the accident was a suicide attempt. "I think 
it is supposition at this point, but you'd think he would have moved," Tacke 
said. Amtrak officials will also investigate, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers brought the eastbound train to a halt shortly after Strout was 
struck, authorities said.

ELECTIONS / THOUSAND OAKS CITY COUNCIL; WINSLOW'S FINANCIAL PAST RAISES 
QUESTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks City Council candidate Lance Winslow, who has emphasized his 
small-business experience as an asset in his campaign, has a court record of 
failing to repay a major loan and says that he once served jail time for 
bouncing checks. 
</P>
<P>
 Winslow, owner of The Car Wash Guys, is now on probation for driving without a 
license. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a history of traffic violations, including a hit-and-run accident in 
1992 to which he pleaded no contest. That accident was treated as a civil case, 
since no serious injuries were involved, and Winslow was fined $250 and 
sentenced to three years on probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Winslow readily acknowledges his financial problems and spotty driving record, 
but said neither should disqualify him from serving as a council member. 
</P>
<P>
 Because he washes cars throughout the city, Winslow has strong name 
recognition. As one of 16 candidates for three open council seats, Winslow said 
he has tried to run an aggressive campaign, walking precincts for at least 
three hours a day. His supporters have written glowing letters to the editor. 
And Winslow has been backed by Robert K. Hammer, an investment banker who this 
year ran unsuccessfully for a congressional seat representing Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 The 29-year-old carwash owner, who shuns suits and ties in favor of cut-off 
jeans and T-shirts, said he has the energy and drive to overcome his problems 
and turn both his life and the city around. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, there have been problems in the past," Winslow said on Friday. "But I'm 
not a bad person. This could be blown out of proportion." 
</P>
<P>
 Winslow said "the most damaging" incident for his campaign would probably be 
the hit-and-run accident. The court report on the case said Winslow's pickup 
truck sideswiped a motorcycle, ripping off a side mirror and damaging the 
driver's jacket. Winslow did not stop to identify himself to the cyclist, as 
required by law. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've done some stuff I shouldn't have," Winslow said. "We all live and 
learn." 
</P>
<P>
 While Winslow says the hit-and-run accident may cause the most political 
fallout, he says he personally has been the most distressed by his financial 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 In his campaign literature, Winslow stresses the need to find "simple, 
fiscally sound solutions" to government problems. But he acknowledges that he 
has had trouble balancing the books in his own business dealings. 
</P>
<P>
 Court records show that a Municipal Court judge last year found Winslow 
delinquent on payments of a 1986 loan he had taken out to purchase a truck and 
carwash equipment. The judge ordered Winslow to pay $25,649 to First State Bank 
of the Oaks -- a sum which included the bank's legal fees and more than $8,400 
in interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Winslow said he is struggling to repay that debt. But he has not scraped 
together enough money to make a payment in nearly five months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although he would not give details, Winslow said a similar cash-flow crunch 
landed him in jail briefly in the late 1980s, when he bounced payroll checks 
for six employees. That episode did not show up in a review of court files, but 
one local businessman confirmed that he visited Winslow in jail to try to 
collect on a delinquent debt. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a real bummer for me," Winslow said. "It really sucked." 
</P>
<P>
 Winslow said he has learned from his mistakes. Now that he knows what it's 
like to be in debt, for example, he said he will be sure to govern responsibly. 
"I've learned that you can't borrow what you can't pay." 
</P>
<P>
 Above all, Winslow said, his struggles have strengthened his conviction that 
business owners deserve a break. 
</P>
<P>
 Winslow believes that city laws cracking down on mobile carwashing in Thousand 
Oaks and Westlake Village have cost him thousands of dollars this year. Because 
of those restrictions, he said, his business has suffered and he has been 
unable to pay his debts. 
</P>
<P>
 To boost his bank account, Winslow said he's been washing cars for 15 hours a 
day, with no vacation in three years. Now, however, he's decided to take some 
time off to campaign for a seat on the council. 
</P>
<P>
 He wants to govern, he said, so he can free business owners like himself from 
onerous regulation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can save one business person in this town, it'll be worth it," he said. 
"I can't see another 'For Lease' sign in this town" indicating that someone's 
business has gone belly-up, Winslow added. "I won't let that happen. Because I 
care, I have to run for City Council." 
</P>
<P>
 Several local politicians, however, said they believe Winslow's court records 
could seriously damage his candidacy. "It could challenge his credibility and 
character," Mayor Alex Fiore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Winslow recently received a $130 fine for violating a Thousand Oaks law that 
requires commercial car washers to collect all runoff water in a special 
plastic raft. 
</P>
<P>
 And just four months ago, he was cited for driving without a license. Winslow 
said his license had been suspended for a previous traffic violation, but said 
he thought it had been reinstated. He was sentenced to 36 months on probation 
and five days of community service, which he spent picking litter from the

<P>
 "All my life, I've liked fast cars and fast motorcycles," Winslow explained. 
"But I've slowed down. I'm even wearing my seat belt now." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some of his opponents said the pattern of repeated driving problems, 
coupled with Winslow's history of bouncing checks, could prove a liability in 
the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to differentiate between bad luck in business and what might be a 
reflection on your character," said Councilwoman Judy Lazar, who is running for 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Winslow believes he can overcome any doubts. 
</P>
<P>
 In a campaign leaflet, he boasts of raising more than $250,000 for local 
sports teams and charities over the past five years, by organizing carwash 
fund-raisers each weekend. Winslow is counting on the people who have benefited 
from those fund-raisers to back his candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "You need to take my past and you need to take what I've been doing that's 
positive and you need to weigh them against each other," Winslow said. Although 
only 29 years old, Winslow said he feels like he's earned "a 40-year degree in 
the school of hard knocks. Boy, do I have perspective."

KILLER TAUNTS JUDGE AFTER SENTENCING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A convicted murder defendant was determined to get the last word in Friday, 
just moments after a judge rejected his plea for leniency and sentenced him to 
death for killing an Anaheim college student during a carjacking, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It ain't over yet," Shaun Burney, 20, of Tustin uttered as he was led from 
the courtroom, adding an expletive on the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just couldn't believe he said that," said Deputy Dist. Atty. David Brent. 
"This was after he said he was sorry for what he had done and felt so much 
remorse. To me, that means he's a guy who was going to say anything, hoping the 
judge would bite." 
</P>
<P>
 Burney was convicted of first-degree murder, kidnaping and robbery in the 
death of Joseph Andrew Kondrath, 23, in one of Orange County's first carjacking 
cases. Two others were also convicted for their roles in the killing, but the 
most serious punishment was sought against Burney because he was the convicted 
triggerman. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Superior Court Judge Robert R. Fitzgerald said he carefully 
reviewed the evidence in the case and refused to overturn a jury's 
recommendation to condemn Burney to death for his crimes. Burney's attorney 
could not be reached for comment late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Burney became the 30th defendant from Orange County sentenced to death. The 
sentence will automatically be appealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen Dean Burnett, 20, of Anaheim was also convicted of first-degree murder, 
kidnaping and robbery for his role in the crime and sentenced to life in prison 
without the possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Rembert, 22, also of Anaheim, was convicted only of kidnaping. Jurors 
deadlocked on murder and robbery charges. Rembert is expected to be retried on 
those charges, Brent said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kondrath was last seen leaving for his job at a supermarket at 4 a.m. on June 
10, 1992. Prosecutors said he was grabbed from behind the wheel at gunpoint in 
front of his home and forced into the trunk of his own car. 
</P>
<P>
 He was robbed of his wallet, which only contained about $1, and later shot in 
the head. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a sentencing report prepared by the Orange County Probation 
Department, Kondrath begged for mercy, saying, "Don't hurt me, don't hurt me," 
as the men decided who would pull the trigger. 
</P>
<P>
 Burney did, and the following day he went to Magic Mountain amusement park, 
the sentencing report noted. The men committed the carjacking because they 
wanted a car to use in a drive-by shooting, according to the report.

BAKER BLASTS CLINTON'S SABER RATTLING ON HAITI; SIMI VALLEY: FORMER SECRETARY 
OF STATE SAYS THE PRESIDENT'S FOREIGN POLICY DECISIONS ARE DRIVEN BY POLITICAL 
AGENDA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Calling threats to invade Haiti "a misguided effort," formeS. Secretary of 
State James A. Baker III sharply criticized President Clinton's foreign policy 
Friday in an address in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker gave the Clinton Administration high marks on its handling of the Middle 
East peace process and foreign trade treaties, and praised its support of 
Russian economic reforms and its tough stance in the Persian Gulf. 
</P>
<P>
 But Baker characterized the Democratic Administration's overall control of 
foreign policy as stagnant and driven by domestic politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have yet to get a satisfactory answer to three questions," Baker, a 
longtime Republican campaigner and former President George Bush's secretary of 
state, told a crowd of about 300 at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, exactly what are the compelling national interests that require us to 
invade?" he said. "How will we withdraw once we assume the responsibility for 
the future of Haiti?" 
</P>
<P>
 "And thirdly, my friends, why now?" Baker asked. "Why now, nearly three years 
after (Jean-Bertrand) Aristide was overthrown and 20 months after the Clinton 
Administration took office, do we decide to send Americans into harm's way? Why 
does the Clinton Administration consider it so vital and so important to make 
such a momentous decision just weeks before the November elections?" 
</P>
<P>
 A nuclear North Korea poses a far greater threat to U. S. interests than does 
Haiti without democracy, Baker told audience members, who paid $18 to $20 per 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker said he supports Clinton's decision to block the entry of Cuban refugees 
into the United States. But he criticized the President's willingness to talk 
with Cuban Premiere Fidel Castro, saying the U. S. should not negotiate with a 
head of state who has been at odds with this country for more than 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In Haiti and elsewhere, U. S. foreign policy lacks direction and consistency, 
said Baker, who was to leave Simi Valley after his speech to stump for 
Republican Senate and gubernatorial candidates in Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfulfilled threats in Bosnia and flip-flopping in the Clinton 
Administration's policies on Haiti, China and Somalia "debase the currency of 
our credibility as a nation," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some in the Clinton Administration point out that the United States' stances 
on foreign crises in nations such as Bosnia and Somalia were left over from the 
Bush Administration, Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's true, but it's beside the point," he said. Every American President 
has inherited his predecessor's foreign policy problems, Baker said, adding: 
"Foreign policy doesn't stop for the inauguration of an American President, and 
history -- sad to say today -- doesn't wait for his education." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker said the United States needs to restore its credibility, which he called 
"far too precious a commodity to be frittered away by a 'policy-of-the-week' 
toward North Korea or Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States also should be more careful about where, when and how it 
engages with other nations, sort out its objectives and stop considering 
foreign policy as an extension of domestic politics. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said the United States should consolidate the authority over foreign 
policy under the President and recognize "the imperative of American leadership 
in the international arena." 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing is clear," Baker said, "the current Administration really does risk 
squandering the precious legacy of leadership that was bequeathed to it by the 
Reagan and Bush Administrations." 
</P>
<P>
 After Baker's speech, 36 people attended a $250-a-plate luncheon with the 
former Cabinet member to raise money for the Ronald Reagan Presidential 
Foundation's speakers forum and to supplement the library budget, said library 
spokeswoman Linda Schuler.

EPISCOPAL GROUP THAT AIDS NEEDY FEELS PINCH; CHARITIES: THE NUMBER OF THOSE 
SEEKING HELP IN ORANGE COUNTY IS GROWING AT THE SAME TIME THAT DONATIONS ARE 
DECLINING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE EARNEST, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Episcopal Service Alliance centers across Orange County are operating under an 
increasing strain as calls from financially strapped residents have risen over 
the past year while charitable donations have fallen, the community service 
agency's executive director said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 While the centers also help the homeless, Dennis White said most calls for 
help have come from the ranks of the working poor who need help paying the 
rent, utilities or to simply feed their children. 
</P>
<P>
 For some families, White said, a financial crisis can be caused by an 
unexpected automobile repair or even a costly prescription at the pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are, more and more, seeing people living on that very thin edge, trying to 
stretch their budget as far as it can go and looking to groups like ESA and 
others to fill that void," he said. "I would say the work we do mostly is 
trying to prevent homelessness." 
</P>
<P>
 During the past year, White said calls for assistance from south Orange County 
have jumped by about 20%. Elsewhere in the county, the increase has ranged from 
10% to 20%, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, cash donations to the group in August were $30,000 less than 
during the same period in 1993. Even donations of food from local churches has 
fallen off. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Mendoza, Orange County's homeless issues coordinator, said other 
providers throughout the county are also struggling to meet a growing need, 
most reporting an increased demand of 10% to 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just in one area," she said. "It appears to be countywide." 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza agreed that donations of money and food have "dropped remarkably," a 
reality she attributes largely to "compassionate fatigue." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like, we've given, given, given and how much more do we have to give?" 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 White said he believes the cause of homelessness has become increasingly 
unpopular, a reality that adds to his organization's woes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There seems to be a trend developing that people who are homeless or in 
jeopardy of being homeless are not as popular anymore," he said. "There isn't 
as much emphasis on, 'What should we do?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Even in Laguna Beach, a city known for its devotion to such causes, Episcopal 
Service Alliance is having trouble finding a place to reopen a permanent 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 A branch office which had operated on Coast Highway for six years and served 
about 900 people a month, was forced to close in December. It was the only 
place in south Orange County where the homeless could take a shower. 
</P>
<P>
 While the organization had hoped to reopen by June, officials say they have 
been stymied by prejudice and high rents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever we find some place that looks good and looks like it will suit our 
needs . . . quite often the owners don't want to rent to us," said Marsha Bode, 
former director of the Laguna branch. "We have to find an owner, first of all, 
who is sympathetic and who knows our program. I'm not losing hope yet." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, volunteers in Laguna are distributing funds to the needy from 
the Neighborhood Congregational Church. They are dispensing food to families 
from the Woman's Club of Laguna Beach and passing out sandwiches on the beach 
at lunchtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "It spreads us awfully thin," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 Episcopal Service Alliance also has community services centers in Anaheim, 
Huntington Beach, Santa Ana and San Clemente. They run two shelters: Anchor 
House in San Clemente for the homeless, and Martha House in Orange for homeless 
women. Soon, there are plans to open Beacon House in El Modena for the mentally 
disabled homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 The service centers operate with one paid program manager and volunteers. To 
further cut costs, White said the organization next year will relocate its 
corporate office in Laguna Hills to a less expensive site in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he added, a section of the new corporate office may have to be used 
as a service center to help needy Laguna Hills and Lake Forest residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We certainly feel that more services are needed and we're just trying to keep 
up with that growth," he said.

PEROT URGES BACKERS TO OPPOSE HAITI INVASION, FIGHT FOR REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Trying to recharge supporters for the 1994 elections, Ross Perot urged an 
enthusiastic crowd of more than 2,400 Friday to fight military intervention in 
Haiti and to push for government reform, a balanced budget amendment and 
payment of the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
 "You made a difference in 1992.You're making a difference now. . . . You ain't 
seen nothing yet," he said, speaking at a pre-election rally sponsored by 
United We Stand America, the political organization that evolved from his 1992 
bid for the presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 The rally was one in a series of 10 nationwide designed to focus attention on 
the upcoming November elections by increasing voter turnout, boosting voter 
registration and informing the public about candidates and issues, organizers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect to stir things up and see that the best candidates and issues win 
in November," said Judy Duffy, coordinator of the rally, which was held at the 
Sequoia Conference Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking for 80 minutes in his folksy Texas twang, Perot drew laughs and 
numerous thundering rounds of applause from the audience. He criticized the 
recent crime bill, the Clinton economic plan, the North American Free Trade 
Agreement and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 1992 presidential bid, Perot captured 19% of the nationwide vote and 
24% in Orange County. He said his goal today is to see talented Republican and 
Democratic candidates run for office. 
</P>
<P>
 But many in the audience clearly hoped he would change his mind and run again. 
They sported T-shirts, buttons and hats with the "Perot for President" slogan.

TIMING OF DOCTOR'S REPORT IN DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police, social service workers and the doctor who examined a severely abused 
10-year-old boy gave conflicting reports Friday of how quickly the physician, 
Dr. Annette C. Bernhut, recognized and told authorities of critical injuries 
that could have killed the child. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing of Bernhut's report is critical to the case because doctors told 
police that the child could have died if he were brought to the hospital 30 
minutes later, according to Lt. Timm Browne of the Orange Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The child, whose tongue was seared with hot knives and who was anally 
penetrated with a souvenir baseball bat, remained hospitalized Friday. His 
internal injuries were so severe that doctors surgically implanted a colostomy 
bag on his abdomen last week. 
</P>
<P>
 His aunt, Cynthia Medina, 31, has been charged with one count of torture and 
four felony counts of child abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Police contend that Bernhut waited five hours before notifying the Orange 
County Child Abuse Registry Sept. 8 that the boy had suffered the critical 
injuries, an assertion Bernhut denied Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernhut examined the child between 10 a.m. and 11 a.m. on Sept. 8 -- the day 
after he was allegedly assaulted -- but the doctor did not make her report 
until 4:30 p.m., Browne said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bob Griffith, deputy director for the Orange County Social Services 
Agency, said Friday the doctor had faxed the child-abuse report to the Child 
Abuse Registry at 2:20 p.m., more than two hours earlier than police say it 
arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernhut, an osteopathic physician who operates a family practice at 1005 E. 
Chapman Ave., in Orange, declined to answer questions but issued a statement 
late Friday that she suspected child abuse after examining the boy and 
immediately reported it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of patient confidentiality, I cannot provide you with more specific 
information other than the case was reported immediately," said Bernhut. "I 
don't know what happened after that." 
</P>
<P>
 "I care very much about children and in particular this issue. That is why I 
am a physician," she said, adding that she is cooperating with authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith said the state Welfare and Institutions Code requires doctors and 
anyone else in professional contact with children to report any suspicion of 
child abuse to authorities "immediately," without specifying what that means. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rule of thumb we use is 24 hours," he said. "If it is later than 24 
hours, we definitely have a problem with it. Otherwise it depends on the 
circumstances of each case." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith said he is more alarmed that Bernhut apparently did not ascertain the 
seriousness of the child's physical condition when she examined him. He said 
"the actual injuries were much more severe than the ones described in the 
report" that Bernhut sent to the registry, although they were still disturbing 
enough to warrant an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "At whatever time the doctor examined the child, she should have been able to 
better identify the severity of his injuries, " Griffith said. "If at 4:30 p.m. 
he needed emergency hospitalization, what were the extent of his injuries at 11 
a.m.?" 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith said it is unclear exactly how much time elapsed before the social 
worker went to the child's apartment, but it is certain that she saved his life 
by acting almost immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who suspects a child is in imminent danger should call the police -- 
not the Child Abuse Registry -- by dialing 911, Griffith said.

POPULATION POLICIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The scary news is out that soon, by the year 2012, the costs of our 
entitlements will consume all of the tax revenue, leaving no funds for anything 
like defense, law enforcement, education or libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 Your suggested remedies of "novel population policies and more aggressive tax 
collection" in a recent editorial gave me great cause for concern. 
</P>
<P>
 You weren't by chance thinking of China's "novel" population policy which 
gives women no choice when it comes to a second child, forcing abortions with 
harassment, fines, imprisonment and other coercive consequences? I hope you 
didn't have in mind Hitler's "novel" population policy which required the 
elderly, mentally ill and other unwanted groups like the Jews to pay with their 
lives for the entitlement programs he promised and delivered to the Germans. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't it less barbaric to reduce entitlement programs rather than resort to 
"novel population policies" to pay for them?

 BAPTIST EXECUTIVE: A Baptist congregation in Granada Hills will observe its 
delayed 40th anniversary Sunday by hearing from a former member who became a 
missionary in Africa and an executive in the American Baptist Churches in the 
U.S.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Duncan McIntosh, commissioned by Woodley Avenue Baptist Church to serve as a 
missionary in Zaire, is now manager of the denomination's division of 
evangelistic and new church ministries at American Baptist headquarters in 
Valley Forge, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 McIntosh will be the guest speaker at the 10:30 a.m. service at the church, 
10341 Woodley Ave., which will include slide, photo and video presentations 
throughout the building. 
</P>
<P>
 The congregation of about 75 members originally scheduled its 40th-anniversary 
celebration for Feb. 7, but the Northridge earthquake on Jan. 17 wrought 
substantial damage, forcing the services to be held in temporary quarters until 
Easter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Richard Ketchum, the current pastor, said the congregation will hold 
an anniversary banquet at 3 p.m. at Sepulveda United Methodist Church, 15435 
Rayen St., North Hills, which has larger banquet facilities than the Baptist 
church. Former pastors Ed Ervin and Bob Bard will take part in the banquet 
program. For information, call (818) 368-7794.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; WOMEN'S CLUB SHARES DECADES OF MILESTONES; 
SENIORS: THE HAPPY BIRTHDAY GIRLS STILL GATHER TO CELEBRATE AND GOSSIP. 
TWENTY-YEAR MEMBERS ARE STILL CONSIDERED RELATIVE NEWCOMERS.

 Back in the late 1950s, when neighborhoods seemed more neighborly, Kathy 
Raikes learned that one of her neighbors had no living family to remember her 
birthday. So, Raikes baked a cake and together with a few other women in this 
small community west of Palmdale went to the birthday celebrant's home to 
surprise her with gifts and sing "Happy Birthday." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Leona Valley, the tradition started by these women not only continues, 
it has evolved into a club. Four times a year the Happy Birthday Girls meet to 
mark the birthdays of members, celebrate the events in their lives and catch up 
on gossip. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an update of our lives," said Gloria Bryant O'Brien, one of about 15 
members of the group who met Thursday at Jackie's Country Kitchen in Leona 
Valley. "It's just so neat when we meet. It lifts your spirits so incredibly." 
</P>
<P>
 At this gathering, nine members were honored for recently having birthdays. 
There were also congratulations for Jenny Heydorn, a retired schoolteacher who 
just passed a driver's test to retain her license. She is 91. 
</P>
<P>
 As with all Happy Birthday Girls get-togethers, births, deaths and other 
information was exchanged in an energetic flurry. 
</P>
<P>
 Who has done what, where, when, how? How many grandchildren have you had? How 
many great-grandchildren have you had? These are the typical questions, O'Brien 
said. "Then somebody is usually asking for the bill and we're out the door." 
</P>
<P>
 But not before the entertainment section of the program. At the most recent 
lunch, one of the women recited an essay entitled, "Hugging: The Perfect Cure 
for Whatever Ails You." 
</P>
<P>
 The entire group includes about 20 women who are "approaching their 70s" or 
beyond, O'Brien said. Twenty-year members are still considered relative 
newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it remains a rural area, the Leona Valley has changed since many of 
the members grew up here. O'Brien said the regular gatherings help them stay 
focused on who and what is important in their lives. Some women who have moved 
out of the Leona Valley schedule their vacations to visit for the gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
 Raikes, who now lives in Tucson, has not been able to make it back for a 
meeting for several years, but she stays in touch by mail. 
</P>
<P>
 "The years in between don't make any difference," said O'Brien. "It's just 
like you saw everybody yesterday."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; OBJECTIONS EXPECTED IN SCHOOL BOUNDARIES 
SHIFT; EDUCATION: STEVENSON RANCH ELEMENTARY OPENING WILL PULL 500 STUDENTS 
FROM EXISTING CAMPUSES. PARENTS ARGUE FOR NEIGHBORHOOD CHOICES. 
</P>

<P>
 Parents angry about shifting elementary school boundaries will get a chance to 
voice their views in a series of six public Newhall School District meetings 
beginning Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The boundaries are shifting because of the Stevenson Ranch Elementary School 
now under construction and scheduled to open for the 1995-96 school year. 
</P>
<P>
 About 500 students will be transferred from the district's six existing 
schools to the new school, located just west of the Santa Clarita city limits, 
Supt. J. Michael McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents have objected to redrawing the boundaries, saying they moved to 
certain areas within the Santa Clarita Valley because they wanted their 
children to attend a specific school. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath said proposed boundaries -- based on such considerations as minimizing 
transportation costs by busing as few students as possible and keeping an 
ethnic balance of students at each school -- won't be drawn until November or 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next step after we have done these input meetings will be to put together 
some scenarios, and those will go to the (district) board," he said. "We will 
then take those back out for public input." 
</P>
<P>
 Approval of the final boundaries is expected in January or February, McGrath 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1 1/2-hour meetings will each include a 20-minute presentation about why 
the boundaries are being changed. 
</P>
<P>
 The first meeting, scheduled Monday at 7 p.m. at Meadows Elementary School in 
Valencia, could be the most controversial. 
</P>
<P>
 The group Parents for Neighborhood Schools was formed by parents with students 
at the school, one of two in the district recognized as nationally 
distinguished during the 1993-94 school year. Parents there have told board 
members they don't want their children attending less desirable schools. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath has stated that those parents have the least to worry about because 
most of the students who will go to Stevenson Ranch live closer to the new 
school than those going to Meadows. But he said he does not know if boundaries 
might be redrawn so that students from faraway schools, including Meadows, are 
included to balance out the transfers. 
</P>
<P>
 Other meetings are scheduled Wednesday at Newhall Elementary School, Thursday 
at Wiley Canyon Elementary School, Sept. 28 at Valencia Valley Elementary 
School, Oct. 3 at Old Orchard Elementary School, and Oct. 11 at Peachland 
Elementary School.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; EX-PATRIOT OWNER FACES NEW TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal appeals court ordered a new trial in a $51 million lawsuit that 
former New England Patriots owner William H. Sullivan won against the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1st Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a second trial is necessary 
because of prejudicial errors made in the original trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief among the errors, the court said, was a judge's failure to tell the jury 
that Sullivan had been involved in developing the ownership rules he later 
contested in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan filed suit against the NFL in May 1991, seeking $116 million in 
damages. He claimed the league's refusal to allow him to sell public stock 
forced him to sell the team to Victor Kiam in October 1988 for what Sullivan 
considered to be a low price of $84 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Last October, a U.S. District Court jury returned a verdict in Sullivan's 
favor after a month of testimony and deliberations, awarding Sullivan $38 
million which was automatically tripled under federal antitrust law. Another 
judge then reduced the award to $51 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In Friday's ruling, Chief Justice Juan Torruella wrote that the judge in the 
original trial should have instructed jurors about the legal ramifications of 
Sullivan's involvement in drafting the ownership policy.

TV'S 'SUPERMAN' UNDERGOING A PLANETARY SHIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In last season's finale of ABC's "Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of 
Superman," Lois Lane's fairy tale wedding to Lex Luthor was rudely interrupted 
when police barged in and revealed Luthor's involvement in the criminal 
underworld. After a brief chase, Luthor leaped from the balcony of his 
penthouse apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 His untimely exit turned out to be merely the first in a parade of sweeping 
cast and crew changes that mark a new comic-book direction for the series, 
which launches its second season Sunday night. 
</P>
<P>
 After the final episode last spring, "Lois & Clark" creator Deborah Joy LeVine 
left the series, and Michael Landes (who played Jimmy Olsen), Tracy Scoggins 
(who played Catherine Grant), the visual effects supervisor and the entire 
writing staff, among others, were either eliminated or replaced. Original 
executive producer David Jacobs had already parted ways after six episodes. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to attract a greater number of men and boys this year, Superman 
will be less shy in flexing his steely muscles. The show, which was weighted 
toward romance and wit last season, will offer more action sequences packed 
with bigger stunts, new special effects and villains galore, ranging from 
Bronson Pinchot as the Prankster to Emma Samms as Luthor's ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to change what really worked well last year. The Lois and Clark 
repartee and banter is funny and clever. People like it, and we want to keep 
it," said executive producer Bob Singer, who directed a couple of episodes 
early last season before replacing Jacobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "But by the same token, when we come up with a villain, we want to make him a 
little more credible -- a job for Superman -- to heighten the action and 
suspense and to provide more jeopardy in the show," Singer said. "We're going 
to try to mix the villains up more this year. That burden really fell to Lex 
Luthor last year." 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, Luthor, played by John Shea, was symbolic of the creative split 
that emerged last season on "Lois & Clark." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very interested in keeping Lex Luthor, exploring his character, making 
him a regular part of the show," said LeVine, a former story consultant on 
"Equal Justice." 
</P>
<P>
 The network felt differently. "You can't keep bringing back the same villain 
week after week. At some point, Superman needs to vanquish the villain," said 
Brian McAndrews, vice president of current series programs for ABC. 
</P>
<P>
 When Lorimar Television was purchased by Time Warner -- changing its name to 
Warner Bros. Television -- executives at the TV studio began poring over the 
catalogue of properties owned by Time Warner and found DC Comics, including 
Superman. Warner Bros. decided to create a breezy show for the 1990s, 
reminiscent of "Moonlighting," to attract women. So it asked LeVine to put a 
humorous, romantic spin on the man in tights.  
</P>
<P>
 "This originally began as a Tuesday or Wednesday show for 10 p.m., so 
relationship, relationship, relationship was the important thing," said Leslie 
Moonves, president of Warner Bros. Television. 
</P>
<P>
 But ABC chose instead to air it Sundays at 8 p.m., a heavy family viewing hour 
when there are more TV sets on across America than any other time of the week. 
At the last minute, LeVine had to retool her modern comic vision of Lois and 
Clark, played by Teri Hatcher and Dean Cain, in order to accommodate viewers of 
all ages. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were scheduled on Sunday at 8 p.m., we needed more than just romantic 
comedy," Moonves said. "To get men and to get kids, we needed much more 
Superman stuff. There were certain revisions made along the way that became 
more clearly defined as the season ended." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, LeVine sighed, "I really wasn't very interested in doing an action 
show or a superhero-saves-the-day show. I was interested in doing a 
relationship show." She is now co-executive producer of NBC's new "Sweet 
Justice," a legal drama, although she remains an executive consultant on "Lois 
& Clark." 
</P>
<P>
 The show now belongs to Singer, who created "Reasonable Doubts" and was 
executive producer of "Midnight Caller." "I don't view the changes here as 
terribly drastic," he said. "There have been lots of reports in the press that 
we're really overhauling the show, going for more action and losing the charm 
of Lois and Clark. That's not true -- the charm is going to be there every bit 
as much as last year. We're just going to improve the things we didn't do real 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 There still appear to be growing pains, however. Jim Crocker was brought in by 
Warner Bros. and ABC to work as an executive producer with Singer. Crocker was 
a producer last season on "Star Trek: Deep Space Nine." "His charge is really 
to temper my adultness, and to keep the kids happy," Singer said. "He's real 
steeped in comic books and action superheroes." 
</P>
<P>
 But the latest word is that Crocker is not working out and may not stick 
around. "It's not turning out to be a marriage made in heaven," one source 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other changes seem to be progressing more smoothly. Last season, the offices 
of the Daily Planet newspaper where Lois and Clark work was designed for beauty 
and not function; moving cameras to meet the rigors of an eight-day shooting 
schedule was tough. The set was blown up by Luthor in an episode late in the 
season, giving Singer a chance to have a new one designed over the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Zarate, the new visual effects supervisor, filmed lasers that he will 
composite into shots to make Superman's X-ray vision and heat vision more 
realistic. He's also working up elaborate flying sequences, with Superman 
diving and cutting around structures, rather than just drifting over the tops 
of buildings.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was told to make this like a roller-coaster ride," Zarate said. "From the 
teaser through the end of the show, they really want to keep a lot of action 
sequences going and keep Superman in the show." 
</P>
<P>
 "Lois & Clark" finished second in its time slot last fall, behind CBS' 
powerful "Murder, She Wrote" but ahead of NBC's much-ballyhooed "seaQuest DSV," 
and it scored high with adults ages 18 to 49, a key demographic for which 
advertisers pay a premium. ABC ordered a full season's worth of 22 episodes. 
Still, the network is banking on a better overall performance. The series 
finished No. 65 out of 132 prime-time programs last season. ("seaQuest," also 
undergoing an overhaul this season to play up the science-fiction elements, 
finished No. 83.)

PRIME COUNTRY, ALL IN ONE PACKAGE; POP REVIEW: VINCE GILL IS MR. VERSATILITY AS 
HE COVERS THE MUSICAL FIELD WITH GRACE AND CONFIDENCE AT THE GREEK. AND 
OKLAHOMA'S BLUEGRASS-TRAINED TENOR LEAVES OUT THE HOKUM.

 It used to be that if you wanted to see the most versatile star in country 
music, you were stuck with Roy Clark pickin' 'n' grinnin' his way through 
cornball antics as he showed off his skills on a variety of instruments and 
styles. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Greek Theatre on Thursday, Vince Gill showed that he's setting new 
standards for country variety -- and without the hokum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have anything that blows up or inflates," he joked in a rare 
self-referential moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure, Garth Brooks may be a more gregariously ambitious presence, George 
Strait may have a more pure country voice, and dozens of others may write good 
songs more consistently than Gill. But who else offers the whole package? 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, the easygoing Oklahoman's bluegrass-trained high tenor moved 
gracefully and confidently between romantic ballads, mournful weepers, rocking 
swing and country-pop crossovers. 
</P>
<P>
 His songs -- though sometimes dry and uninvolving on record -- came to the 
fore in concert with a depth and subtlety often missing in country. And he 
flat-out dazzled the enthusiastic crowd with his nimble guitar playing. 
</P>
<P>
 About the only one of his talents this golf enthusiast didn't display on stage 
was putting. 
</P>
<P>
 The real marvel is that Gill did all this without any sense that he was 
showing off. Where so many others in country make a big deal about being 
regular guys with their overdone golly-gosh manner and blue-collar jingoism, 
Gill simply is a regular guy. 
</P>
<P>
 Where others devise showy spotlight segments for their -- or more likely, 
their band members' -- instrumental skills, Gill and his accomplished 
nine-piece group simply played. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a showcase for singer Dawn Sears fit in naturally, as she put forth her 
Brenda Lee-meets-Reba McEntire vocals on a hot "Oklahoma Swing" duet with Gill, 
and as the lead on two other songs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What it all added up to was a sparkling show with Gill investing equal life in 
his weepy cheating song, "Pocketful of Gold," and such upbeat swing tunes as 
"South Side of Dixie." 
</P>
<P>
 If there's a flaw, it's the common curse of a performer whose talent seems so 
effortless that you don't feel him stretching artistically. That's more a 
problem on his too-low-key albums than it was on stage where his genuine joy in 
the music flowed freely. 
</P>
<P>
 Gill doesn't really break any new ground, he just covers more of it than 
anyone else in contemporary country. 
</P>
<P>
 * Vince Gill plays on Sunday with Trisha Yearwood and Larry Stewart at Irvine 
Meadows Amphitheatre, 8800 Irvine Center Drive, Irvine, 7:30 p.m. $25-$37.50.

THEATER REVIEW; 'HOME' IS A STATE OF MIND, AND OLD GLOBE UNDERSTANDS IT WELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 David Storey once told an interviewer that critics did a disservice to his 
play "Home" when they interpreted the title to mean a nuthouse. In fact, it's 
more a pensioner's place of retirement, with a hint of punitive incarceration, 
but Storey's point is that his home is a state of mind. It's the little bit of 
earth left to us at the end of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally Storey described his main characters as in their 40s, but since 
John Gielgud and Ralph Richardson famously played them somewhat older in the 
original 1970 Royal Court production (and later on Broadway), Jack and Harry 
are usually portrayed as in their 70s, which suits the play's elegiac mood. The 
Old Globe Theatre's new production, starring Donald Burton and Jonathan 
McMurtry, hits that mood beautifully, loses it to tedium and then regains it in 
a particularly gracious finish. 
</P>
<P>
 As in the work of Samuel Beckett, tedium is a relative term here. Jack 
(Burton) and Harry (McMurtry) talk of a life so mundane and conventional that 
they never have to finish a thought, if in fact they have any. When Jack says, 
"Oh, yes . . . . What's life worth . . . ," Harry responds with, "Oh, yes." In 
a short time we understand that their vague musings are in fact a tacit 
agreement to avoid any painful thought, particularly of the mortality that is 
so achingly at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The entry of two less-refined women, Marjorie (Anne Gee Byrd) and Kathleen 
(Katherine McGrath), disrupt the men's polite veneer, and soon the men can't 
stop the tears from flowing, although their language remains steadfastly 
non-specific. The women have a more intimate knowledge of life's ugliness, 
gained partially from their harsher financial circumstances (they look one step 
up from bag ladies). But where the men are given to sudden bursts of tears, the 
women tend to interrupt with gales of giggles, usually because they insist on 
finding some adolescent sexual innuendo in every sentence the men utter. For 
what the women know, Storey seems to suggest, laughter is a better defense. 
</P>
<P>
 The second and even harsher interruption into the men's cocoon is Alfred, a 
lobotomized ex-boxer who seems to be under employ to move what pitifully little 
furniture there is around the grounds. Soon Jack and Harry are shaken into more 
tears, still holding faithfully and resolutely onto the only lifeboat they know 
-- that is, the remarkably pliable generic language that Storey has invented 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Lucas' necessarily minimal set (a distressed table and chairs) sits on a 
floor of mossy blue-green and brown, the color of oxidized metal, which nicely 
suggests a dying lawn. Kent Dorsey's lighting casts an autumnal shade on the 
nondescript stone steps that surround the action. 
</P>
<P>
 Burton and McMurtry, the Laurel and Hardy of the piece, establish a lovely 
rapport, sometimes hale and hearty, other times laced with maliciousness. As 
Jack, the slightly more colorful fellow, Burton is wonderfully funny and 
subtle, particularly in his British egocentrism. He holds the theory that there 
is physical evidence to suggest that the Vale of Evesham, where his old aunt 
resided, may actually have been the original Eden. 
</P>
<P>
 As the women, Byrd and McGrath are both technically good, although their 
presence somehow reduces the play's energy rather than elevates it. Leo 
Stewart's Alfred is a lumbering, simian moron. Although I don't know how an 
actor might play a lobotomized ex-boxer with any subtlety, this performance 
seems over the top. 
</P>
<P>
 Otherwise, Craig Noel's direction is sound and sensitive to the story's tiny, 
shifting moods. Storey finely walks the line between the mundane and the tragic 
-- the line his characters and his audience spend most of their time trying to 
avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen reminds the men of this line when she asks Harry, "Where you going 
when you leave here?" Although he can only respond with "Well . . . I . . . 
er," Harry is clearly thrown by this jarring question, and he weeps 
unassumingly. Later, when Alfred enters to remove the chairs and asks, "You 
finished?," his question prompts more tears. Jack and Harry are left standing 
to contemplate the sea, the church and the end of the day. Jack muses somewhat 
mysteriously: "Once over. Never again," and we know what he means. At that 
point, so late in the day, the audience, too, might find itself in a quiet vale 
of tears.

GETTING BACK TO BASS-ICS; A NEW ALBUM HAS GIVEN PRODUCER MARCUS MILLER THE 
CHANCE TO PLAY UP HIS INSTRUMENTAL SIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marcus Miller has been mainly known as a producer, the man who has overseen 
scores of albums, from Miles Davis' "Amandla" and "Tutu" to David Sanborn's 
"Straight to the Heart." This year alone, he has produced Sanborn's "Hearsay," 
Al Jarreau's "Try a Little Tenderness" and Luther Vandross' "Never Let Me Go." 
</P>
<P>
 It has gotten to the point where a lot of people forget that Miller entered 
the world of professional music about 15 years ago as a bassist who has 
displayed his extraordinary talents in performances with everyone from Davis, 
Sanborn and Vandross to Joe Sample, Aretha Franklin and McCoy Tyner. 
</P>
<P>
 That's all changed now. Miller, 33, has a current album, "The Sun Don't Lie" 
on PRA Records, and its release has given him the impetus to pick up his ax and 
walk. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I didn't have an album out, there didn't seem to be any sense in touring," 
Miller said. "But people didn't know if I had given up playing; I realized that 
when I went to Europe this spring. I hadn't been there for 12 years, since I 
was there with Miles, and the French treated me like a returning prodigal son, 
while the Germans were angry, like, 'Where have you been?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, a native of Brooklyn who grew up in Jamaica, N.Y., has only been 
playing scattered club dates in the past few years, hardly enough to keep 
himself sharp. Now he's on the road and has put in about six months of steady 
playing throughout Europe and the United States. He appears tonight with his 
band at the Hyatt Newporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing feels nice, but even nicer is the reaction from the people," said 
Miller, whose band spotlights reedman Kenny Garrett, drummer Lenny White and 
keyboardist Bernard Wright, players he has known through various projects. "We 
interact, talking to each other with our instruments." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's music has a buoyant contemporary feel to it. Sometimes pieces are 
driven by walloping rhythms, at others the sounds are lyrical and serene. Asked 
if he wanted to categorize what he's playing now, Miller laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I call it fusion. It's a word I avoided for 10 years, but that's the best one 
to describe it. It's been so long since fusion was around that people no longer 
have preconceived notions about it. I combine different elements, mB, with 
jazz. That seems to get me off the hook." 
</P>
<P>
 The bassist will be playing tunes from "The Sun Don't Lie" and other 
selections, including "Catembe" and "Tutu," which he wrote and recorded with 
Davis. He admits his band doesn't have a big repertoire yet, but he wants to 
build it up by taking some older material -- say, from his two mid-'80s Warner 
Bros. albums, "Suddenly" and "Marcus Miller" -- and dusting it off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to run a tune down at the sound check and then try it," Miller said 
from his West Coast home in Brentwood, where he lives with his wife and their 
5-year-old son. "With musicians like these, it's good to throw them a curve 
ball every now and then. It takes a certain amount of courage when you play 
stuff, and you really don't know if it's going to work." 
</P>
<P>
 But even if he's playing the same repertoire night after night, the music 
still sounds different, Miller said, because each audience is different. 
</P>
<P>
 "Music always connects you to the people who are hearing it, and you can't 
ignore it. You get a different reaction -- from the band, from the audience -- 
and you have to pace your show accordingly. That's why we're a jazz band. 
That's the whole point. We vibe off each other, off the people and try to play 
what we feel." 
</P>
<P>
 During his days ensconced in the studio as a producer, Miller definitely took 
time off from his instrument, but he feels that he's starting to get some of 
the punch back that makes performing such a thrill. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least I'm back to zero," he said. "I'm getting stronger, where I can begin 
to play what I'm thinking instead of worrying if I'm going to be able to play 
the lick. Now, there are times when I can't wait to get on stage and do 
something. Excite the band, excite the people." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said his period with Davis, with whom he played in the early '80s, 
after the trumpeter returned to the stage after a seven-year hiatus, remains 
key in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 "He helped me dig into myself," Miller said. "He wasn't settling for anything 
mediocre. He helped me develop my style. And I learned from him that you can't 
be affected by what others say about you. You just have to be honest about who 
you are and what you're doing. If you follow that, you won't have problems." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Miller looks at the life of a musician as a blessing, and he doesn't take that 
for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can get to the point where people are interested in what you are 
expressing, what you have to say, you're really fortunate. So before each show, 
I get the guys together and say a prayer: 'God, you know you didn't have to put 
us here together, and we're truly thankful.' That puts everybody in the right 
space so they can go on stage not thinking about themselves, or what's wrong, 
but 'Let's check out what's right.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * Marcus Miller plays at 7:30 p.m. today at the Hyatt Newporter, 1107 Jamboree 
Road, Newport Beach. $15. Food and beverages are available. (714) 729-1234.

DREAM TEAMS TO HIT COURTS FOR GOOD CAUSE; FUND-RAISER: GAME AT UCI'S BREN 
EVENTS CENTER TO BENEFIT THE PEDIATRIC AIDS FOUNDATION WILL FEATURE NBA GREATS 
AND HOLLYWOOD CELEBRITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As Rod Stewart would say, tonight's the night. Orange County gets its own pair 
of Dream Teams, and the reason is no less significant than the 1992 Olympic 
gold brought home by the original squad. 
</P>
<P>
 To raise $50,000 for the Pediatric AIDS Foundation, MTV has organized a 
basketball game tonight at UCI's Bren Events Center that will bring together 
NBA greats Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (retired L.A. Laker), Bobby Hurley (Sacramento 
Kings), Shawn Kemp (Seattle SuperSonics, and Dream Team II, which won the world 
championships in Toronto this summer), Reggie Miller (Indiana Pacers) and Chris 
Webber (Golden State Warriors). 
</P>
<P>
 As an added attraction, Seattle Mariner Ken Griffey Jr., suddenly free for the 
remainder of what was to be the baseball season, will be playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out the teams will be Hollywood celebrities including Queen Latifah 
("Living Single"), Joey Lawrence ("Blossom"), Dean Cain ("Lois and Clark") and 
David Alan Grier ("In Living Color"). Boyz II Men will sing at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Grier won't be playing. He's benched, but he's not crying foul. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot play at all," he explained by phone earlier this week. "I have 
absolutely no basketball ability. I was booted off the court as a kid. I 
auditioned for 'White Men Can't Jump' and scored 1 point for the other team. 
People thought I was just being funny." 
</P>
<P>
 Given that background, he has been appointed the designated color commentator 
and will work with Detroit sportscaster Van Earl Wright to keep the fans 
enlightened. That's the game plan, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be like real sportscasters," Grier said, "trying to get the players to 
strike." 
</P>
<P>
 Definitely on strike will be a couple of his creations from "In Living Color": 
elderly bluesman Calhoun Tubbs and gay film critic Antoine Merriweather. 
</P>
<P>
 "Antoine will not be there. Absolutely not. I'm just going to be having a lot 
of fun. That's what works best for something like this, instead of planning 
little bits." 
</P>
<P>
 Grier does, however, take the cause seriously, tracing his involvement to when 
he was doing "In Living Color" on Fox and worked with foundation co-founder 
Elizabeth Glaser, the wife of actor Paul Michael Glaser ("Starsky and Hutch"). 
The Glasers' daughter Ariel died of AIDS in 1988 after contracting the virus 
through breast milk from Elizabeth, who had been infected through a blood 
transfusion. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tip-off for MTV's fourth annual "Rock 'n' Jock" B-Ball Jam tonight is 7:30 
at the Bren Events Center on the UCI campus. $8 for adults, $6 for students. 
(714) 856-5000, box office; (714) 740-2000, Ticketmaster.

ART REVIEW; UNEXPECTED IMAGES MAKE 'ANXIETY' WORTHWHILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CATHY CURTIS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four years into the downsizing, recessionary '90s, it's about time somebody 
organized an art show about anxiety. True, nearly all the images in "Anxiety: 
Views of Contemporary Life" at the BankAmerica Gallery (through Oct. 14) were 
made in the go-go '80s. But artists tend to be prescient about shifts in the 
emotional climate of a culture (and of course, even in the midst of plenty, 
life doles out sudden shocks and nagging worries). 
</P>
<P>
 A number of big names are represented, from Andy Warhol to Georg Baselitz and 
Robert Longo. Much of the imagery shares a one-shot appeal. "Get it?" it calls 
out. Yep, we get it. Hardly takes any effort at all. It's not just that we 
recognize a queasy feeling when we see one. Rather, for the most part, the 
artists are capitalizing on familiar imagery instead of locating fresh 
metaphors. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men dangle from a window. Someone balances on a mysterious concatenation 
of ladders strung in midair. Tongues of fire and falling furniture threaten an 
uninhabited bedroom. A vacationing couple embrace at twilight, upside-down, in 
midair. A faceless man sits in a small boat, adrift in an indifferent gray 
universe of sea and sky. And so on. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the images offer something more: irony, or a sense of battling 
impulses, or least an unexpected (and not too literal) image of instability. 
You look, and then you look again, with a feeling of growing recognition that 
invades the spirit as well as the eye. 
</P>
<P>
 In Richard Bosman's woodcut "Adieu," a man runs through a landscape. It's the 
kind of running you do in dreams, where you are any size you need to be, and 
the man's giant step sails effortlessly over rooftops and trees. He is leaving, 
he is cutting his traces, he has said his goodbys. But his hand seals off his 
face, as if he is willing himself not to see the familiar things that might 
hold him back. And he has a third foot that remains stuck on the ground, the 
part of himself that cannot quite pull away. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosman's incisive line sculpts the bulky body in a beguiling, quasi-folkloric 
style, emphasizing the dreaminess of the image and the mood. (In "Falling Man," 
on the other hand, he opts for a telegraphic abbreviation of the body, as if 
the act of falling has neutralized it into sheer planes of force.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Leo Rubinfien's Ektacolor print "London" seems quite nondescript at first. A 
young woman in Hyde Park sits at the water's edge in one of the canvas chairs 
provided for summer visitors. She clutches a slim paper bag to her chest and 
looks out at the photographer with panicked eyes and an open mouth. The scene 
is uncrowded, non-threatening. It's impossible to tell what private demons 
provoke the woman's response. If free-floating anxiety has a face, this is it. 
</P>
<P>
 Borrowing stylistic quirks from vintage boys' book illustrations, Glen Baxter 
takes a completely different tack, monumentalizing trivial events in a way that 
archly zeros in on a society absorbed in narcissistic pursuits (in "How He 
Hated Saturday Morning Shopping," a young man of means sobs at the wheel of a 
small boat) and redefinitions of familial roles, as well as an art world 
constantly rummaging through past styles. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Baxter's "It Was the Fourth Time That Daddy Had Fallen for the Exploding Fork 
Routine" revisits the traditional upper-class family dinner table, which has 
been invaded by the entrepreneurial, imaginative kiddie realm of "A Boy's Book 
of Magic Tricks." Poor Daddy has a mess on his hands, but we postmoderns 
realize it's probably apt punishment for his patriarchal attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Warhol rarely disappoints, and in this show his silk-screen "The Shadow" is 
the perfect self-portrait of his tensely inscrutable persona. A flat, frontal 
view of Warhol's face merges with a silver-edged rock star-style profile 
pointed backward toward the twinkling surface of the mica-dazzled background -- 
the image of someone constantly monitoring the effect of his actions on the 
chimerical world of gossip and hype. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the show's main -- and unwitting -- revelation has to do with Longo's 
iconic big-scale black-and-white lithographs from his "Men in the Cities" 
series. At a decade's remove, these images of nattily dressed young people 
reeling, grimacing and twitching have lost their sleekly choreographed allure 
(Longo derived the intense postures by asking friends of his to assume disco 
poses). 
</P>
<P>
 Images that once seemed to be brilliant billboards for the Angst of an entire 
generation now hold about as much psychological content as a double-page spread 
for the Gap. Longo's skill at co-opting the values of media culture has 
boomeranged on him, draining the message out of the medium. 
</P>

 'Trek's' New Star: The latest round of musical captain's chairs for the 
upcoming TV series "Star Trek: Voyager" seems to have finally been settled. 
Actress Kate Mulgrew will become the first female captain of a Federation 
Starship in the latest "Star Trek" spinoff, which begins airing in January on 
the new United Paramount network. Genevieve Bujold had been named captain but 
resigned after several days of filming when she learned how arduous the 
schedule would be. Mulgrew has appeared in many TV movies and series, including 
roles in two short-lived NBC shows, "Kate Loves a Mystery" and "Man of the 
People," and also on the ABC soap "Ryan's Hope." In her new role, she will be 
charged with leading a lost U.S.S. Voyager back into Federation territory.

 Ratings Watch: "All-American Girl," the new ABC sitcom with comic Margaret 
Cho, got off to a good start Wednesday. A preview of the show attracted 27% of 
the viewing audience at 9:30 p.m., when it followed a repeat of "Home 
Improvement." CBS, meanwhile, aired back-to-back episodes of its new comedy 
"The Boys Are Back" from 8 to 9 that night, with the second finishing behind 
the season premiere of ABC's "Thunder Alley" and the second half of "Beverly 
Hills, 90210" on Fox. Next week, "All-American Girl" moves to the 8:30 p.m. 
slot, following "Thunder Alley."

 Where's 'Pat'?Officials at Walt Disney Studios apparently have decided that 
"It's Pat," starring Julia Sweeney as the gender-neutral character she played 
on TV's "Saturday Night Live," may not be ready for widespread release. The 
film had been scheduled to open in Los Angeles this weekend, but that plan was 
scrapped. Officials now say the movie probably will open on "college campuses" 
and other smaller venues. Disney had test-marketed the film in Seattle, Spokane 
and Houston, but audiences were evidently less than thrilled. Says a source: 
"If it makes sense to play L.A., we'll play L.A. Right now, when it opens is 
under evaluation." LEGAL FILE

 Guilty Plea: Tupac Shakur may face up to 90 days in jail and a $100 fine after 
pleading guilty in Lansing, Mich., to charges he tried to hit another rapper 
with a baseball bat. The incident prompted a fight during an April, 1993 
concert at Michigan State University. Shakur is to be sentenced Oct. 26; he had 
been charged with felonious assault but that was reduced to a misdemeanor. THE

 Menotti Fired: Italian opera composer Gian Carlo Menotti, founder of the 
renowned Spoleto performing arts festival, was fired Friday as artistic 
director of the Rome opera. Giorgio Vidusso, the opera's superintendent, said 
artistic differences led him to release Menotti, 83, a two-time Pulitzer Prize 
winner who launched the Spoleto festival in central Italy in 1958. Menotti, who 
has a history of battling superiors for artistic control, last year broke with 
the U.S. version of the Spoleto Festival in South Carolina after arguing that 
corporate sponsors had too much control over it.

HOLLYWOOD BOWL ORCHESTRA SHINES IN CLASSICAL PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the Los Angeles Philharmonic still in Europe on tour this week, the 
Hollywood Bowl Orchestra has had its mettle tested in the strictly classical 
music arena. Thursday night at Hollywood Bowl, under the baton of John Mauceri, 
the orchestra achieved some notable results. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the performances on view were flawless, but, at their best, they went 
beyond the merely tidy run-throughs that this orchestra sometimes offers. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first half of the program, Mauceri and ensemble were abetted 
considerably by the presence of the 32-year-old British pianist Stephen Hough, 
playing the work in which he had made his Bowl debut in 1985, Rachmaninoff's 
Rhapsody on a Theme of Paganini. 
</P>
<P>
 Hough gave a reading at once nonchalant and meticulously finished. Crisply, 
elegantly articulated, relaxed in its virtuosity, ample and unhurried in its 
lyricism, it unfolded with perfect logic and kittenish charm.  
</P>
<P>
 Although the piano amplification wasn't as clear as it should and can be, that 
turned out to be no great demerit. The orchestra seemed to catch Hough's 
spirit.  
</P>
<P>
 After intermission, in the first three-quarters of Saint-Saens' "Organ" 
Symphony, Mauceri took a careful and steady approach that for the most part 
worked. The music bloomed naturally as the conductor kept the slowish pace 
graceful, the momentum building, the ensemble nicely balanced.  
</P>
<P>
 The finale proper fell short of these marks -- there was a labored quality to 
its bombastic goings on -- and the organ proved sometimes too loud, sometimes 
too rattling. Nevertheless, this was a clearly vital and accomplished account. 
Alexander Frey, played the organ part cleanly. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert, attended by 10,841 listeners, opened with Franz Waxman's Ride of 
the Cossacks from the 1962 film "Taras Bulba," which sounded like Khachaturian 
on a bad day -- and that's pretty bad.TIMOTHY MANGAN

HE WANTS TO CHASE THE GANGSTAS OUT OF RAP; POP MUSIC: AHMAD'S SINGLE 'BACK IN 
THE DAY,' WHICH OFFERS A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON LIFE IN SOUTH-CENTRAL L.A., 
IS G-RATED -- AND A HIT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gangsta rap may be continually criticized for glorifying violence and sexism, 
but few of the potshots come from the rap community itself. Even "G-rated" 
rappers seem to accept gangsta rap as a legitimate force -- or worry about 
speaking out and being branded as wimps. 
</P>
<P>
 But not Ahmad, a small, wiry 18-year-old Los Angeles rapper whose 
introspective -- and G-rated -- "Back in the Day" is one of the season's 
biggest rap singles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people might see me as a traitor but that doesn't matter," says Ahmad, 
who grew up in South-Central Los Angeles and uses only his first name (his last 
name is Lewis). 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not supposed to knock gangsta rap, particularly if you're from 
South-Central. Some people might think that some rap fans will turn their backs 
on you if you knock it. But I can't worry about that. I have a forum now and 
I'm not afraid to use it to say some things that need to be said." 
</P>
<P>
 When Ahmad talks, people listen. 
</P>
<P>
 Articulate, confident and animated, he drives his points home with the skill 
of a seasoned public speaker as he sits behind a desk in the small, windowless 
room in his manager's Westwood office. 
</P>
<P>
 He becomes more impassioned the more he talks about gangsta rap. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main thing is the negative influence on the kids," he says, hands 
stretched in the air, emphasizing his sense of despair. "How can you make this 
kind of music knowing kids will hear it and learn bad things from it? Black 
people are making these songs about black people. We're destroying ourselves, 
teaching our kids low self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
 He's still just warming up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the shock value of gangsta that gets to everybody," he adds. "Once 
people stop being shocked by it -- which will happen in the next few years -- 
they'll see these rappers are basically full of hot air. 
</P>
<P>
 "What bothers me is that there are some fakes out there, rappers who aren't 
what they claim to be. They're in it for the money, exploiting their own 
people. What I want to show is that rappers don't have to resort to that. I 
felt I could make a good hip-hop album without all that gangsta foolishness." 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmad has done just that. His debut album on Giant, "Ahmad," ranks with the 
year's finest rap collections, offering a different perspective on 
South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back in the Day" looks back to the '80s, "when things were a little better," 
he explains. "What I'm trying to do is represent the voiceless majority in 
South-Central, the people who hate gangs, who feel victimized by their 
surroundings, who don't see any glamour in gangsta rap, who think about things 
other than drugs and shooting and chasing women." 
</P>
<P>
 Explaining the themes of his album, Ahmad adds: "It deals with life 
experiences, with different scenarios from my neighborhood. There are some 
messages, but I don't preach. Like on the new single, 'You Gotta Be . . . ,' I 
don't say don't be a gang-banger, but when you listen to the lyrics you get the 
message. The point is to make your own choices and don't just follow the 
crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 Could Ahmad's strong words harm his career? 
</P>
<P>
 "Some gangsta rappers may turn up their noses at him. They probably won't 
appreciate the criticism," says Billboard magazine's rap expert, Datu Faison. 
But Faison sees Ahmad's stance as potentially more of an asset than a 
liability. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think kids will turn their backs on him because he's knocking gangsta 
rap," Faison says. "It may even have some impact on rap fans, who'd be more 
inclined to listen to a young rapper than some minister or politician who's 
knocking gangsta rap. It may help Ahmad at radio. Some programmers who are 
against gangsta rap may start supporting him." 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmad, who graduated from high school last year, says he would be in college 
on a football scholarship right now, playing flanker or cornerback, if it 
weren't for his passion for rap.  
</P>
<P>
 He was bused from South-Central to Palisades High School, where he was an 
honor student, captain of the football team and participated in student 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to go there at first, but my mom made me," he says of the 
Pacific Palisades school. "It was hard at first because I didn't fit in. Also, 
I had to get up so early to catch the bus and I'd come home at night and have 
to walk through my neighborhood, which is no fun at night. But I made the best 
of it." 
</P>
<P>
 A dedicated rapper since he was 12, he got a deal at Giant Records last year 
after making a demo record. His primary goal, he says, is just to be a better 
rapper. 
</P>
<P>
 "I practice every day, trying to master this art form," he says. "That's why 
it upsets me when these gangsta rappers who can't rap come in and have hits 
based on exploitation. I love and respect rap -- they don't."

POP MUSIC REVIEW; 311 AT ROXY MIXES POWER AND FINESSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Soon after hitting the stage at the Roxy on Thursday, the band 311 was soon 
standing shirtless and sweaty above the mosh-sauna swirl. Fan euphoria aside, 
the sound of 311 is about more than the usual funk rock themes of sex and 
youth.It's mainly about music . 
</P>
<P>
 The primal output of these five players from Omaha, Neb., matches the energy 
of anything else in the neo-funk-rock genre, while drawing on a sophisticated 
range of such other music as jazz, reggae and pop. That musical vocabulary had 
the band often at its best at the Roxy when deep into an accelerated 
instrumental jam, more Meat Puppets than Chili Peppers. 
</P>
<P>
 Drummer Chad Sexton shuffled all these diverse tempos into a cohesive rhythm, 
as co-vocalists Nicholas Hexum and SA traded raps and a smoother funk crooning, 
never overwhelmed by the volume around them. 
</P>
<P>
 Now well into their second national tour, the band (relocated to Los Angeles) 
has attracted a passionate club following, without the benefit of significant 
radio airplay. This 90-minute show demonstrated a mix of power and finesse that 
the band has yet to fully capture on record. But the performance of songs from 
the new "Grassroots" album showed it's mastered this intensely urban pop style.

THEATER REVIEW; PALACIOS' ONE-WOMAN SHOW: SOME RAMBLING 'CONFESSIONS' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I'm over 30 and life's tough," laments Monica Palacios in her new one-woman 
show. "But I'm still a racy chick. I ride the RTD . . . naked." 
</P>
<P>
 "Confessions: A Sexplosion of Tantilizing Tales" promises plenty of racy 
revelations from Palacios, the self-described "Latin lezbo comic" who has made 
her Chicana and lesbian identities the focus of a promising performance career. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the one-act piece, now at Highways Performance Space in Santa Monica, 
seldom lives up to its tantalizing title. Palacios instead delivers a string of 
rambling and not-very-revealing erotic monologues presumably based on real 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no hot jalapenos here, to paraphrase one of the show's jokes -- just 
lots of mild salsa. 
</P>
<P>
 Remarkably low-key for a stand-up comic, Palacios has an earthy, 
self-deprecating presence that serves her well as a storyteller. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that doubters have wondered whether she really posed for the show's 
sexy handbill photograph, she strips down to nothing but a black slip, a move 
that she says has "surprised friends and scared children." 
</P>
<P>
 Palacios' strongest material concerns life with her Latina lover, whom she 
calls her "wife . . . missus . . . the little woman." She recounts a visit to a 
sex shop, where her partner's professed embarrassment belied a strong desire to 
test the merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of the scenes remain flat and underdeveloped. A great opportunity for 
satire is missed during a bit about a combination jazz lounge and women's 
health clinic, "where you can hear your favorite show tunes and get a pap smear 
at the same time." The setup has no punch line, as Palacios merely launches 
into a fairly straightforward lounge medley and forgets the part about the 
health clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 A tale about lust between two prospective roommates might have worked if acted 
out, but Palacios has unwisely chosen to read the text at a podium while 
photographs and slogans are projected on a nearby slide screen. The result is a 
static and overlong narrative that seems to devour a disproportionately large 
share of stage time. 
</P>
<P>
 No director is credited, which probably explains the show's lack of focus and 
momentum. Yet a bigger problem is that Palacios the writer has not done justice 
to Palacios the performer. 
</P>
<P>
 These "Confessions" are, alas, only skin-deep. 
</P>
<P>

THEATER REVIEW; METCALFE'S 'STRANGE SNOW' LINKS OLD WAR, NEW LOVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stephen Metcalfe's "Strange Snow" is going to be around a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 It's one of those war plays that succeeds primarily because it's not about 
war. 
</P>
<P>
 Love is its subject -- it's about a romantic door that opens for two people 
who have never known love, and just as pointedly about the love that binds 
soldiers on the battlefield. And how sometimes the latter must be sorted out 
before the former can blossom. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also about survival and the emotional fallout after the storm of battle 
has passed. In this production at Laguna Playhouse, director Robert Leigh 
catches onto these humanistic themes and molds them with sculptural solidity, 
sympathy and theatricality.  
</P>
<P>
 This play, written in 1983, almost always works to one degree or another, but 
Leigh has really gone to its core. In his hands, the revelations of the second 
act, about what happened in battle, are a shock even when you know what's 
coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Megs (Ron Campbell) is a volatile, angry veteran, as he was an angry soldier. 
David (Andrew Barnicle) is silent and brooding. When Megs bangs on David's door 
for an early-hours fishing date, what he finds is not so much the fulfillment 
of a promise they made to the buddy they left behind in Vietnam, but David's 
plain, lonely high-school teacher sister, Martha (Linda Gehringer). 
</P>
<P>
 Rarely have the tones and colors of Metcalfe's writing been made so clear. 
Campbell is a superlative Megs; in his energy and lightness, he's like a modern 
Puck, what Martha calls "endearing." But there's a volume of subtext going on 
beneath Campbell's surface, details he slowly exposes bit by bit as it becomes 
clear that Megs has a maturity that David is slow finding. It's a stunning 
performance that sticks in memory. 
</P>
<P>
 As Martha, Gehringer is gentle, even when she peaks, a perfect foil and 
balance as Campbell ricochets around her like a frantic puppy. Gehringer 
instills a sense of humor into the relationship that slowly builds between 
Martha and Megs as the action progresses, and her understanding brings new 
insights into the bond slowly building between them. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, Barnicle's beer-guzzling brother, David, who wanted to be a 
lawyer before the war and now drives trucks, is a stereotypical blue-collar 
type, living for the weekend benders that help him forget. But there is also in 
his characterization a hidden agenda that gives it richness. The scene in which 
Megs helps bring David out of the darkness of his guilt has never been more 
effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacquie Moffett's living room/kitchen setting seems a bit expanded on the 
Laguna stage for the size of the action, but its look is just right, and is 
warmly and evocatively lit in Paulie Jenkins' lighting design. 
</P>
<P>
 David Edwards' sound design is also a plus, a solo guitar invoking the play's 
period and the period of the emotional cataclysm that holds Megs and David in 
its grip.

what's coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Megs (Ron Campbell) is a volatile, angry veteran, as he was an angry soldier. 
David (Andrew Barnicle) is silent and brooding. When Megs bangs on David's door 
for an early-hours fishing date, what he finds is not so much the fulfillment 
of a promise they made to the buddy they left behind in Vietnam, but David's 
plain, lonely high-school teacher sister Martha (Linda Gehringer). 
</P>
<P>
 Rarely have the tones and colors of Metcalfe's writing been made so clear. 
Campbell is a superlative Megs, in his energy and lightness, he's like a modern 
Puck, what Martha calls "endearing." But there's a volume of subtext going on 
beneath Campbell's surface, details he slowly exposes bit by bit as it becomes 
clear that Megs has a maturity that David is slow finding. It's a stunning 
performance that sticks in memory. 
</P>
<P>
 As Martha, Gehringer is gentle, even when she peaks, a perfect foil and 
balance as Campbell ricochets around her like a frantic puppy. Gehringer 
instills a sense of humor into the relationship that slowly builds between 
Martha and Megs as the action progresses, and her understanding brings new 
insights into the bond slowly building between them. 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, Barnicle's beer-guzzling brother David, who wanted to be a 
lawyer before the war and now drives trucks, is a stereotypical blue-collar 
type, living for the weekend benders that help him forget. But there is in his 
characterization also a hidden agenda that gives it richness. The scene in 
which Megs helps bring David out of the darkness of his guilt has never been 
more effective. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacquie Moffett's living room/kitchen setting seems a bit expanded on the 
Laguna stage for the size of the action, but its look is just right and is 
warmly and evocatively lit in Paulie Jenkins' lighting design. 
</P>
<P>
 David Edwards' sound design is also a plus, a solo guitar invoking the play's 
period and the period of the emotional cataclysm that holds Megs and David in 
its grip.

TV REVIEWS; 'CHICAGO HOPE' A MEDICAL MELODRAMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The new CBS drama series from David E. Kelley ("Picket Fences") is familiar 
television dipped in high gloss: A bureaucratic but medically sound hospital 
environment that hemorrhages hope, not heartbreak. Headstrong but gifted 
doctors. A no-nonsense but caring chief of staff who goes to the mat for his 
guys. The whole, formulaic works. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chicago Hope" gets by from time to time on the magnetism of its lead 
characters: dashing Dr. Jeffrey Geiger (Mandy Patinkin), the surgical staff's 
abrasively self-centered genius, and Dr. Aaron Shutt (Adam Arkin), its 
upstanding gentle genius. But they wear thin -- in particular the arrogant, 
sanctimonious, demon-ridden Geiger, who ultimately becomes as much of a 
gross-out as the gory surgery he performs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, the nasty but brilliant Geiger heads a surgical team that separates 
Siamese twins. For a real hoot, catch the wide shot of Geiger and his group in 
medical tunics, striding briskly toward the operating theater like World War II 
pilots dashing for their B-25s. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Shutt, Geiger's humble but brilliant best friend, removes a massive 
brain tumor with the assistance of the angry but brilliant chief surgical 
nurse, Camille (Roxanne Hart), who also happens to be the wife who is leaving 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, the staff's pompous but brilliant aging star, Dr. Aaron Thurmond (E.G. 
Marshall), may have lost his skills, and the fatherly but brilliant chief of 
surgery, Dr. Phillip Watters (Hector Elizondo), is nice, but firm, although 
sensitive while still being tough as nails. 
</P>
<P>
 Less smart are the plots of the first two episodes, which treat your 
heartstrings like taffy pulls while imploring you to care which high-risk 
patients survive. A hint: They don't call this place "hope" for nothing. All 
the while Sunday, a genuine issue -- whether a hospital should husband its 
resources for an operation that will benefit so few -- is touched upon, but 
swiftly dispatched. 
</P>
<P>
 In Episode 2, airing at 10 p.m. Thursday in the show's regular time slot -- 
opposite another new medical drama, NBC's "ER" -- Geiger is especially snotty 
to nurse Shutt and also crosses an ethical line, irking just about everyone. 
But ultimately all is resolved because he's so brilliant. 
</P>
<P>
 Glimmers of good acting peep through this maze of melodrama. Yet "St. 
Elsewhere" practiced more interesting medicine, and Kelley's Emmy-laden "Picket 
Fences" is bolder and more likable. More significant, so is "ER." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Chicago Hope" premieres at 8 p.m. Sunday on CBS (Channels 2 and 8). HOWARD

TV REVIEWS; 'BURNING SEASON': REVEALING HUMANITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The word hero tends to get debased in a world that elevates its sports, film 
and pop music stars to often gratuitous heights. What makes HBO's "The Burning 
Season" such a memorable viewing experience is that it movingly portrays the 
type of deep courage and humanity that lies behind our most worthy role models. 
</P>
<P>
 In this fact-based film about Brazilian activist Chico Mendes, hero isn't 
defined in the larger-than-life terms sometimes favored by television. Instead, 
director John Frankenheimer and actor Raul Julia present a decidedly ordinary 
man driven to extraordinary action through the sheer force of his moral 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Mendes is a prototypical Everyman who is neither a fiery orator nor a 
worldly erudite. But what this union leader does possess is a native 
intelligence and an unshakable determination to fight for the rights of the 
oppressed rubber tappers in his province of Cachoeira. Armed with basic reading 
and writing skills that most of his rural compatriots lack, Mendes sets out to 
stop the destruction of the Amazon rain forest by cattle ranchers and 
government officials.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Burning Season" concludes with a series of frightening statistics and 
facts regarding the ever-shrinking rain forests. It's nearly impossible not to 
be affected by the disturbing aerial shots of lush forest lands being razed by 
roaring fires. 
</P>
<P>
 But the film is hardly a didactic plea to save the earth. For Mendes, who was 
taught as a child to respect the natural environment, the grass-roots movement 
he pilots has more to do with defending the land and work rights of his people 
than protecting the ozone layer. In fact, the stubborn idealist expresses 
surprise when he discovers that he has become an international symbol for the 
environmental movement. 
</P>
<P>
 An acutely visual filmmaker, Frankenheimer elicits choice performances from 
nearly all of his actors. Tomas Milian plays the wicked rancher, Darli Alves, 
with a chilling arrogance. But it is Julia who anchors the movie. Looking 
slimmer than he ever has on film, the Puerto Rican-born actor shows that he can 
carry a scene whether he's deep in reflection or bristling with outrage. 
</P>
<P>
 * "The Burning Season" airs at 8 tonight on HBO, with repeats Tuesday, Sept. 
25 and 28, and Oct. 3 and 6. JON MATSUMOTO

SMITH HAS CAREER DAY AS GRANT WINS; HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: HE GAINS 352 YARDS 
AND MAKES KEY DEFENSIVE PLAY FOR LANCERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Di-onte Smith of Grant High rushed for 352 yards and three touchdowns in 19 
carries, but he had to make a big defensive play with about a minute remaining 
in Friday's nonconference game against Marshall to preserve the Lancers' 20-15 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall (0-2) had a second-and-six play from the Grant 19-yard line with 1 
minute 5 seconds left -- and the clock running -- when the Barristers called an 
end reverse. The play appeared to catch Grant off guard as Mike Orta swept 
around the left side. But when Orta cut back toward the center of the field 
instead of angling toward the corner of the end zone, he was popped by Smith, 
who caused him to fumble. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant's Adam Crespo recovered at the eight. The Lancers then ran out the 
clock. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew we needed to make a big play on defense right then," Smith said. "We 
kind of came apart in the last couple of (minutes), but I made the hit, Adam 
made the recovery, and things turned out all right." 
</P>
<P>
 Although no one was sure where Smith's performance ranks on the all-time City 
Section list, Grant Coach Bill Foster said he was "99% sure" it was a school 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who had eight carries for 208 yards in the first half, gave Grant 
(1-0-1) a 20-7 lead with 10:31 left in the game when he scored on a 69-yard 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers intercepted a pass by Marshall quarterback Jason Reyes on the 
ensuing series. On Grant's first play, however, Smith fumbled after an 
eight-yard gain, and the Barristers recovered at the Marshall 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Reyes, who completed seven of 17 passes for 79 yards, connected with Sam 
Garcia for a 42-yard gain on the next play, and six plays later, Miguel 
Iglesias capped the drive with a two-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Iglesias' two-point conversion run cut Grant's lead to 20-15. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers then made several mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 First, they were penalized 10 yards for clipping on the ensuing kickoff 
return. Then Smith lost two yards on a first-and-10 play from the Grant 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant was penalized for illegal motion on the next play, and after runs of 
three and 12 yards by Smith, Santiago Saucedo shanked a seven-yard punt to give 
Marshall a first down at the Grant 23 with 1:40 left. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consistency is something we've worked on in practice, but obviously, it's 
something we haven't done yet in games," Grant Coach Bill Foster said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith had rushed for 143 yards in 22 carries in a season-opening 15-15 tie 
with Verdugo Hills, but he surpassed that total on his eighth carry when he 
broke a couple of tackles, bounced outside and raced down the right sideline 
for a 98-yard touchdown with 8:25 left in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's first touchdown had come on a 79-yard run down the left sideline with 
10:36 remaining in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had 225 yards and three touchdowns against Belmont last year, but I've 
never had a game like this," Smith said. "But what can I say? My linemen did a 
great job of opening some holes for me."

CHAPMAN FOOTBALL GIVES PLAYERS CHANCE TO END HIATUS FROM GAME; COLLEGE: 
SCHOOL'S FIRST TEAM IN 62 YEARS FEATURES ATHLETES OF VARIOUS BACKGROUNDS WHO 
TRANSFERRED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 After a 62-year absence, a football team from Chapman will take the field 
tonight at Whittier College. But for many Chapman players, it's the end of a 
shorter, although often painful, layoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Take starting linebacker Mike Simmons, for example. Simmons last played in a 
football game in November, 1992, making four tackles for Cal State Fullerton in 
a 33-16 loss to Nevada Las Vegas. After the season, Fullerton suspended its 
program and he transferred to Division II Central Oklahoma but had to move home 
before football season because he wasn't able to sell his condominium in 
Bellflower. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Todd Gragnano hasn't played in a game since 1991 at Nebraska. A 
standout at Los Alamitos High, Gragnano got to play mop up in three Cornhusker 
games, but transferred to Louisville in 1992 after it became clear that he 
wasn't in the Cornhuskers' plans. At Louisville, he didn't even get to take a 
snap in practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the guys on this team have been waiting for a long time just to put 
pads on again," said starting tailback Darnell Morgan, who last played two 
seasons ago for Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman Coach Ken Visser will try to harness the pent up energy and unleash it 
at 7 tonight against Whittier, the team he coached for the last three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Visser, who had little to work with when he took over at Whittier in 1991, had 
to start completely from scratch at Chapman. But because of an overwhelming 
response to his recruiting efforts -- he had 112 players show up for the first 
day of practice -- expectations have risen. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have the personnel to play the teams on this (level)," Visser 
said. "But I know everybody else has excellent personnel also." 
</P>
<P>
 Visser got a preview of what his team might be capable of last week when the 
Panthers beat the University of San Diego's junior varsity, 41-7.  
</P>
<P>
 Whittier is unlikely to be such a pushover. The Poets return 46 lettermen, 
including 15 starters, from a team that won three of its last four games last 
season. Tight end Eric Hammond and offensive lineman Chris Allen were first 
team All-Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference selections 
last season and quarterback Erik Jencks was sixth in NCAA Division III in 
passing efficiency. QUARTERBACK 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Robinson, a junior transfer from Citrus, and Gragnano will each play, 
but Robinson has the edge because of his running ability. Chapman will run its 
offense out of a formation called the I-Bone, which allows either option or 
standard running plays. Robinson, 6 feet 3, almost went to USC as a running 
back or receiver. Gragnano, 6-1, has the edge as a passer. RUNNING BACKS 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan, a first-team All-Mission Conference selection in 1992, beat out Rancho 
Santiago's Juan Garcia for the tailback spot. Morgan gained 75 yards in three 
carries in the scrimmage; Garcia, who has been slowed by injuries, gained 66 in 
six carries. Aaron Meschuk, who gained 2,208 yards for Whittier Christian High 
in 1992, is a physical fullback. RECEIVERS 
</P>
<P>
 Rio Hondo's Darnell Rubin is the speediest receiver and Fullerton's Terrance 
Green runs the best patterns. Saddleback's Dave Poltl, who set the county 
career reception record with 176 for Capistrano Valley High, and Oscar Ford, 
from Long Beach College and Servite, are solid backups. OFFENSIVE LINEMAN 
</P>
<P>
 Visser is happy with the progress here. "The only thing that has me worried is 
how cohesive they will be early," he said. The Panthers certainly don't lack 
for bulk: tackles Moana Liva (6-4, 320 pounds) and Steve Gardner (6-2, 285), 
guards Kelly Akridge (6-2, 270) and Mark Maddux (6-0, 280). Jeff Wilkes (5-11, 
250) will also play at guard. Liva and center Matt Hertzler of El Dorado are 
the only freshmen in the starting lineup. Brian Macias of Fresno and Geoff 
Jones of Rancho Santiago are expected to play together, often in two-tight end 
sets. DEFENSIVE LINEMEN 
</P>
<P>
 Tackle Efriam Miranda, an honorable mention All-American at Orange Coast, was 
the Panthers' defensive standout at the scrimmage, with seven tackles, 
including three for a loss. Jim Grove, from Fullerton College, joins him at 
tackle. Toney Eggleston, who played at Cerritos and Northern Illinois, is at 
one end and Cerritos' Robert Ernster and San Diego Mesa's Charles Harris are 
competing for the other spot. LINEBACKERS 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron Gutridge, Mike Simmons and Kenison Poching are the starters. Neil 
Griffin, a transfer from Citrus, was slowed early by a pulled hamstring. "Right 
now, the linebackers are the strength of the defense but the other two 
elements, the defensive line and the defensive backs, are catching up," Visser 
said. "They're really starting to do well." DEFENSIVE BACKS 
</P>
<P>
 The cornerbacks are Malcolm King, who played at Buena Park, Cal State 
Fullerton and Saddleback College, and Shad Vickers, who played at Tustin High 
and Orange Coast. The safeties are Al Mejia, from El Toro High, Cal State 
Fullerton and Saddleback, and Atlas Helaire, a sophomore from Compton Dominguez 
High. Helaire is the only starter who was at Chapman before Visser. SPECIAL 
TEAMS 
</P>
<P>
 Kicker Bill Hamlin missed two of his first three extra points in the 
scrimmage, but made his last two and made field goals of 40 and 34 yards. Mario 
Acosta averaged 39.5 yards on two punts. 
</P>
<P>
 Rubin, Todd Stock and Ford will return punts and kickoffs. Chapman's Starting

CLIPPERS BEATEN AGAIN AS HARPER JOINS THE BULLS; PRO BASKETBALL: CHICAGO SIGNS 
FREE-AGENT GUARD FOR ESTIMATED $2 MILLION PER SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Guard Ron Harper, who was suspended for one game last season after he likened 
playing for the Clippers to being jailed, gained his freedom Friday, signing a 
multiyear deal with the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
 No terms were disclosed, but Harper is believed to have received the salary 
slot of $2 million per season that became available when Michael Jordan retired 
last year. Under NBA rules, the Bulls would lose the slot unless they signed a 
player by Nov. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, was not available for comment. The Bulls, however, have scheduled a 
news conference at their practice facility in Deerfield, Ill. this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper, 30, became a free agent on July 1 after the Clippers balked at his 
demand for a $20-million, five-year contract. The Clippers reportedly offered 
Harper's $2.4-million salary slot to free-agent forward Wayman Tisdale of the 
Sacramento Kings. Tisdale rejected the Clipper offer to sign an $850,000, 
one-year contract with the Phoenix Suns. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper began negotiating with the New York Knicks after contract talks with 
the Clippers broke off and reportedly was close to signing a $1.25-million, 
one-year deal to play in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 But Harper, who lives in a Cleveland suburb, had said that he wanted to play 
in Chicago because it's close to home. The Bulls were the first team he 
contacted. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was our target from the first in July," Chicago General Manager Jerry 
Krause told the Chicago Tribune. "He gives us an outstanding athlete, a fine 
defensive player, an excellent open-court player with a real good attitude, and 
a tough kid. He gives us that athlete at that spot we like." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulls, who have sought a shooting guard to replace Jordan, will have a 
different look next season. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Horace Grant signed with the Orlando Magic and the Bulls have been 
trying to trade All-Star forward Scottie Pippen. Center Bill Cartwright signed 
with the Seattle SuperSonics and guard John Paxson retired. 
</P>
<P>
 "We pinpointed Ron as the combination scorer and defender we wanted, and he's 
going to fit well into our system," Chicago Coach Phil Jackson told the 
Tribune. 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Coach Bill Fitch said he did not include Harper in his plans for next 
season because he was not sure Harper would re-sign with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I look at the way (Harper) felt about playing in Los Angeles and what he 
wanted to make playing in Los Angeles, I haven't built any real plans around 
him," Fitch said. "The fact that he didn't want to be here kept him out of any 
plans I was going to make. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're starting right now to rebuild this ballclub, and you can't even think 
about rebuilding it with people who don't want to be here." 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Terry Dehere, the Clippers' No. 1 draft pick last season, will probably 
compete for Harper's spot with rookie swingman Eric Piatkowski. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clippers' second-leading scorer last season, Harper averaged 20.1 points, 
6.1 rebounds and 4.6 assists but shot only 42.6% from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper's departure nearly completes the disintegration of the Clippers. Four 
of the five starters from that Clipper team have left. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Ken Norman signed a free-agent contract with the Milwaukee Bucks last 
summer. All-Star forward Danny Manning was traded to the Atlanta Hawks last 
February for Dominique Wilkins and the 25th pick in the 1994 draft. Wilkins 
then left to sign a free-agent contract with the Boston Celtics in July. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after the draft, the Clippers traded disgruntled guard Mark Jackson 
and the draft rights to Louisville guard Greg Minor, the 25th player selected, 
to the Indiana Pacers for guard Pooh Richardson, forward Malik Sealy and the 
rights to Piatkowski, the 15th player selected. 
</P>
<P>

SAVE THE RAMS TASK FORCE UPS OFFER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WEBER and MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With St. Louis and Baltimore knocking hard at the Rams' door, the group trying 
to keep the team in Southern California upped the stakes Friday, presenting the 
Rams with a package that would assure the team revenues of between $15 million 
to $20 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, the new proposal also includes season-ticket and luxury 
box guarantees similar to ones being offered by other cities wooing the team. 
</P>
<P>
 In a two-hour meeting at the Rams' Los Angeles headquarters Friday, members of 
the Save the Rams task force promised the Rams sales of 45,000 season tickets 
and the income from roughly 100 luxury boxes -- mostly from within the Orange 
County business community. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also boosted the renovation package for Anaheim Stadium from the $40 
million offered last month to $60 to $70 million, and included a definite 
timetable for completion of the renovations. 
</P>
<P>
 The new package more than doubles -- from about $5 million to $12 million -- 
the budget for a proposed state-of-the-art training facility and corporate 
headquarters in Orange. The facility would be built on the 26-acre site of the 
Stadium Drive-In across the Santa Ana River from the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram President John Shaw's only public comments Friday were that he was taking 
the new proposal under consideration. But Shaw told Save the Rams members he is 
speeding up the timetable and will be making a decision about the team's future 
in the next four to six weeks. He plans to respond to the latest Save the Rams 
proposal within the next two weeks, task force members said. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's meeting was attended for the first time by Dale (Chip) Rosenbloom, 
owner Georgia Frontiere's son with the late Ram owner Carroll Rosenbloom. Save 
the Rams members said Rosenbloom asked a number of pointed questions about the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that Chip Rosenbloom is there is (a sign) that we're being taken 
more seriously," said Orange County Supervisor William G. Steiner, who attended 
the meeting. "The important thing is the process is continuing. The door has 
not been shut. (Shaw) has been characterized as having made up his mind. Well, 
he sure asked a lot of questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Save the Rams co-chairman Leigh Steinberg said he was optimistic Friday's 
offer would put Anaheim in strong contention to keep the team -- without 
"imperiling the financial stability" of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "The irony of all this is that it took the Rams talking about leaving to put 
together the type of deal that would have made them very happy all along," said 
Steinberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg said the package presented Friday included changing the name of team 
to Orange County Rams and "a commitment in terms of quality of on-field product 
and marketing and promotion of the team in Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 A proposal to buy a minority share of the team continues to be part of the 
package, though not a focus, Steinberg said. But a new proposal that would have 
had a local group buying the team for an estimated $150 million to $200 million 
was quickly quashed by Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also addressed Shaw's concerns about Anaheim Stadium's co-tenants, 
the California Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Angels are critical to this process," said Steinberg, who declined to 
elaborate on specific plans. He said the idea is to build a new baseball 
stadium in the same general area.

KARIYA TAKES WING ; DUCKS' ROOKIE DETERMINED TO MAKE AN IMPACT IN FIRST SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The sudden bursts of acceleration along the left-wing boards already are 
familiar. So are the passes that send the puck sliding toward the open man like 
metal to a magnet. 
</P>
<P>
 So too is the sight of Paul Kariya turning the corner behind the net at warp 
speed, ready to put the puck on the stick of any Mighty Duck wise enough to 
hustle in front of the net and wait for the inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks finally have highlight capability, after welcoming a rookie into 
camp who idolizes Wayne Gretzky and says he wants to play the game of hockey 
the way Magic Johnson plays basketball. Whenever Kariya is on the ice, there is 
a chance he will try to make a breathtaking play -- a no-look pass, a pass off 
his skates, a backhand assist behind his back. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, the Ducks' play of the game was usually a save by Guy Hebert. 
Sure, there was an occasional pretty goal, or a breakaway by Joe Sacco. But the 
Ducks won 33 games in their first season by playing grinding, disciplined 
defense. This season, led by a line centered by veteran Anatoli Semenov and 
with Kariya and fellow rookie Valeri Karpov on the wings, they actually will be 
fun to watch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It almost feels like the handcuffs are off," says Coach Ron Wilson, who says 
he doesn't want to be known as "a plodding, defensive-minded coach" but 
acknowledges the Ducks had no option last season if they were going to have any 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 Kariya, 19, who signed a three-year, $6.5-million contract Aug. 31, is 
preparing to make one of the most anticipated NHL debuts in recent years, 
provided there is no lockout. His 5-foot-10, 170-pound body has been considered 
his one drawback -- and the reason he lasted until the fourth pick in the 1993 
draft. Kariya knows he will have to make adjustments to play in the NHL and, 
after two exhibition games, already has begun. 
</P>
<P>
 In his NHL exhibition debut, against Dallas on Tuesday, Kariya had a goal and 
an assist, but sat at his stall after the game, dissatisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 The game had been at least a couple of notches more physical and intense than 
an intrasquad scrimmage, and Kariya knew the regular season would be yet 
another step. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a learning experience," he said. "I have to learn what I can and can't 
do at this level. . . . Nothing comes just like that. It takes years, not just 
one game, to learn to play at this level." 
</P>
<P>
 The game was a physical one, and Dallas players took aim at Anaheim's hotshot 
rookie more than once. Craig Ludwig welcomed him to the NHL with a hit that 
knocked his helmet off -- one of a few runs that led Wilson to say he made a 
mistake by leaving tough guys Stu Grimson and Todd Ewen at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they had a chance to give me a shot, they gave me a shot. That's the 
game of hockey," Kariya said. "(But) I put myself in positions where they could 
do that." 
</P>
<P>
 He found fault with his play, regretting that he hadn't established his speed 
early to force the defense to back off, disappointed that he hadn't seen more 
quickly that Dallas was playing him to make his cutback moves. Dallas' checking 
line kept such close tabs on him, he wasn't able to carry the puck the way he 
is accustomed to doing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks expect him to find ways to counter most of what the NHL throws at 
him. Already, he has a quick bailout move to avoid big hits, and although no 
shrinking violet, he does pick his spots. No sooner was the game over than 
Kariya was thinking about what he would do differently in his next. 
</P>
<P>
 His ability to shape his game to the circumstances has been proven in the past 
year. When the Ducks drafted him, he had just become the first freshman to win 
the Hobey Baker Award, which recognizes the best U.S. college hockey player -- 
and has been no guarantee of NHL success in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the time they signed him 14 months later, he had starred for Canada's 
silver-medal winning Olympic team and, more impressively, for the gold-medal 
winning World Championship team in a tournament well stocked with NHL players. 
</P>
<P>
 His second NHL exhibition game, against San Jose in Denver on Wednesday, was 
different entirely from his first. Instead of a tight-checking, hard-hitting 
game, it was a wide-open finesse game, and Kariya was spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, he was also pointless, even though his performance was far better 
than in the previous game. But he had near breakaways, pushing the puck out 
ahead and then accelerating around the defense to pick it up, and he set up 
teammates for terrific chances -- chances no one cashed in on. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson thinks the Kariya-Semenov-Karpov line could mean to Anaheim what the 
Johan Garpenlov-Igor Larionov-Sergei Makarov line meant to San Jose last 
season. One of the few flaws he sees is occasional over-passing by Kariya and 
Semenov. 
</P>
<P>
 Karpov, 23, whom the Ducks drafted in the third round in 1993 but were unable 
to sign until this summer after he had played for Russia in the Olympics, is in 
position to capitalize. Just as Kariya did, Karpov had a goal and an assist in 
his debut. If Kariya weren't around, Karpov, With his strength and mature play, 
would be the rookie hotshot. 
</P>
<P>
 Semenov, 32, who played in Russia until 1990, had his best NHL season in 
1992-93 while playing on a line with Pavel Bure in Vancouver. He knows Kariya 
isn't as strong or quite as rocket-fast as Bure, but, he says, "same thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul plays like a Russian," Semenov said. "He plays like Pavel Bure. He has 
speed and he's smart."

ALLAN MALAMUD: A STATE DRESSED IN RED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ALLAN MALAMUD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The opponent can be Middle Tennessee State or Oklahoma, the weather a heat 
wave in September or a snowstorm in November. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what, every Nebraska home football game is a sellout. 
</P>
<P>
 Has been since Nov. 3, 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 The home opener today against UCLA will be the 196th consecutive full house in 
Lincoln, an NCAA record. 
</P>
<P>
 Memorial Stadium will become the third largest city in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wait until you see it," said Brenden Stai, the Cornhuskers' All-American 
offensive guard from Yorba Linda. "It's awesome, 76,000 people dressed in red 
and roaring." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it is the only game in this capital city of 200,000, where the 
Frisbee was invented and Charles Lindbergh learned to fly. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also the only game in a state that does not have a major league 
professional sports franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 The same can be said about a number of other states represented by big-time 
college football teams, but few of them are afflicted with such a fever every 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska football sets attendance records because it is a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 A local radio station is conducting a contest that will award "an 
all-expenses-paid trip for two to Nebraska's bowl game." 
</P>
<P>
 Such confidence is justified by the fact that the Huskers -- it's Huskers, not 
Cornhuskers, around here -- have been to 25 consecutive bowl games. 
</P>
<P>
 A record 26th is a cinch for a team ranked No. 1 in the USA Today/CNN poll and 
No. 2 in the the Associated Press poll.  
</P>
<P>
 So what if the Huskers have lost their last seven bowl games? 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Tom Osborne, in his 22nd season, has a record of 208-47-3 and ranks 
either just ahead of or behind Joe Paterno of Penn State in most of the 
important categories among active Division I-A coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Osborne's reputation is one of the reasons a school that doesn't have the 
national following of Notre Dame or the in-state recruiting advantages of the 
Florida schools or Penn State is able to win so consistently. 
</P>
<P>
 Stai -- who was recruited by UCLA and USC, among others -- was asked why he 
chose Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 First, he gave the politically correct answer: academics. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the football tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, the weight room. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourth, the experience of living away from home. 
</P>
<P>
 The weight room was the most intriguing. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't really a weight room, it's the Nebraska Strength Complex. 
</P>
<P>
 It occupies 30,000 square feet, the largest such facility on any American 
campus, and is located in a building attached to the south side of the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "The birthplace for strength and conditioning for collegiate athletes," says 
the sign in the Strength Complex Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 In the lobby are pictures and stories of players selected to the Huskers' 
all-time power team. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an offensive team and a defensive team, but, oddly enough, no kicking 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams were selected by strength coach Boyd Epley. 
</P>
<P>
 He has six assistant strength coaches and a graduate assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started lifting seriously when I was in the 11th grade at Esperanza High," 
Stai said. "I won a competition there, but I've really been able to improve on 
my lifts here. This weight room is a diamond." 
</P>
<P>
 As a freshman, the 6-foot-4 Stai weighed in at a scrawny 260 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he is a 305-pound senior considered by many NFL scouts to be the best pro 
prospect in the nation at his position. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long ago, he set a Nebraska record by bench pressing 505 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coaches had to kick me out today," he said, grinning after a 45-minute 
weight session that followed practice on Wednesday. "Some of them think I 
overdo it, but I don't." 
</P>
<P>
 His teammates on the offensive line average 295, and it is no wonder the 
Huskers play what Stai describes as "smash-mouth football." 
</P>
<P>
 They lead the nation with a 446-yard rushing average in their first two games. 
</P>
<P>
 The oddsmakers suspect that UCLA will be the latest in the long line of Husker 
opponents to get smashed in the mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 "This game means an awful lot to me," Stai said. "A team from your hometown 
has to spark some extra excitement in you." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that any is needed on a Saturday afternoon in Lincoln in front of 76,000 
people dressed in red and roaring.

WILL THIS BE BRAWN OVER BRUINS?; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: EVERYTHING POINTS TO A 
NEBRASKA VICTORY. DONAHUE DIGS DEEP TO FIND HOPE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Let's see. UCLA is playing No. 2 Nebraska -- No. 1 by some counts -- and it's 
here, where the Cornhuskers have won 18 games in a row and the Bruins last won 
when Coach Terry Donahue was 4 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the 196th consecutive sellout, which means 76,000 red shirts worn by 
people who assume that the Bruins will be served quiche at their pregame meal. 
</P>
<P>
 They will be stirred up by the new Diamond Vision, er, Husker Vision screen, 
and excited about today's home opener for a 2-0 team that has quarterback 
Tommie Frazier, one of the 767 or so players being touted for the Heisman 
Trophy. It's also a team that rushed for 527 yards against Texas Tech last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, and No. 13 UCLA's best player, All-American wide receiver J.J. Stokes, 
will be on the sidelines, nursing a thigh bruise. 
</P>
<P>
 All those problems, but Donahue claims to have a solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a saying, 'When one Bruin goes down, another Bruin takes his place 
and plays better than he's ever played,' " Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it might not be the right solution. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had that saying last week, too, and it didn't generate any big plays," 
Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nebraska can answer rhetoric with one of college football's most exciting 
players, Frazier, whose arm is erratic, but who runs the option offense as 
though his first act as a child was recognizing a crashing defensive end and 
pitching out to the I-back. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cornhuskers also will feature I-back Lawrence Phillips, from Baldwin Park 
High, who was an unknown quantity until he ran 26 times for 137 yards against 
the Bruins last year. He is known now, having rushed for 175 yards last week 
against Texas Tech, working behind a line that is approximately the size of 
five silos. 
</P>
<P>
 And Nebraska features a defense that has given up an average of eight points 
in its two games. 
</P>
<P>
 More rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody tries to put them above everybody else," said Stokes. "They're no 
different than anybody else. Everybody says they can't be beat. Obviously, they 
can be beat." 
</P>
<P>
 They have been beaten once in two years, 18-16, in the 1994 Orange Bowl by 
national champion Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond words, though, UCLA has weapons, even if the main one is missing from 
the four-receiver shotgun offense pirated, perhaps fittingly enough, from 
Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their two wide receivers, Stokes and (Kevin Jordan) are impressive players 
and the quarterback, (Wayne) Cook, has good size, throws the ball well and has 
experience," said Nebraska Coach Tom Obsorne before Stokes declared himself 
unable to play. "So, they'll give us a test, as far as our pass coverage is 
concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Cook's experience is in marked contrast to a year ago, when UCLA 
lost at the Rose Bowl, 14-13. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's one of the things that will help us," Cook said. "Last year I 
was playing while looking over my shoulder." 
</P>
<P>
 He had just gotten the starting quarterback job and believed his hold on it 
was tenuous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't throw as well as I do now," Cook said. "We stayed with the running 
game. It was like I wasn't a factor." 
</P>
<P>
 He is a factor now, having completed 67.2% of his 67 passes for 499 yards and 
two touchdowns in leading the Bruins to two victories. Both of the scoring 
passes went to Jordan, who has 13 receptions for 235 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 As important, perhaps, has been the running of Sharmon Shah, who has 291 yards 
in the best start for a UCLA running back since Freeman NcNeil ran for 295 in 
the first two games of 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes they're more dangerous running the ball out of the shotgun than 
anywhere else," said Osborne. "They've got a lot of clever schemes, and (Shah) 
really explodes out of there. They've got a lot of ways to hurt you." 
</P>
<P>
 And Nebraska has what some call its best team in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But how good is it? 
</P>
<P>
 Good enough to beat West Virginia, 31-0. Good enough to beat Texas Tech, 
42-16. So what? 
</P>
<P>
 "This is probably a talent-on-talent situation that will give us a better read 
on whether we're good or not," Osborne said. "I suspect we're good. I'm sure 
UCLA is good, so we'll know a little bit more about everything when this is 
over." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins may not. They beat a good Tennessee team, 25-23, but struggled 
against sub-par Southern Methodist before winning, 17-10. 
</P>
<P>
 And until Stokes can play -- perhaps next week in the Pacific 10 Conference 
opener against Washington State -- it's difficult to gauge the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 Donahue's fondest wish is to wake up this morning and find that some healing 
force has Stokes ready to run pass patterns against Nebraska, though he has not 
practiced in two weeks and said Thursday, "I'll be a spectator." 
</P>
<P>
 "To me there's a hope that on game day an athlete wakes up and all of a sudden 
things change overnight," Donahue said. "There's always a sliver of hope." 
</P>
<P>
 He also has occasionally bought lottery tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never gotten more than two numbers, though," Donahue said. 
</P>
<P>
 He might well need all six to win at Lincoln today. UCLA BRUINS

 Meldrick Taylor's face is calm and determined these days, whereas four years 
ago it was stunned, swollen and hurting. 
</P>
<P>
 For all these years, Julio Cesar Chavez has been an obsession for Taylor, a 
demon haunting his career, and, finally, an inspiration when Taylor decided to 
throw himself back into boxing. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight at the MGM Grand Garden, years after he was written off as merely 
another fighter who was almost great, Taylor finally gets the rematch of a 
fight he fell two seconds short of winning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to beat him," Taylor says of Chavez. "I wasn't going to retire until I 
beat him. I already did once (until Chavez caught him at the end), and now I 
have to prove to everybody I still can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez, though, is not as big as he once was, and even he acknowledges that. 
</P>
<P>
 A controversial draw with Pernell Whitaker last September began the tumble. 
Then he was knocked down by and lost to Frankie Randall. His bizarre victory 
over Randall last May in their rematch -- it was halted by when Chavez was cut 
by a head-butt -- gave Chavez his World Boxing Council junior-welterweight 
title back, but that only muddied the pond more. 
</P>
<P>
 As Taylor moves toward revenge and redemption, the 32-year-old Chavez is 
speaking more and more of leaving the sport and is angrily lashing back at 
those who would tarnish his reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 Chavez is scheduled to make $1 million for this bout, Taylor $400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor wants to reclaim his glory, Chavez (90-1-1, 77 knockouts) wants only to 
protect his. He wants to fight Randall again, and possibly Whitaker, both in 
Mexico, and this Taylor rematch seems mostly a nuisance to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boxing doesn't motivate him as much as it used to," said Gladys Rosa, 
Chavez's friend and interpreter. "And he knows from experience that you can't 
stay in the ring too long once that happens, because your preparation won't be 
excellent and a lot of things can happen in the ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "He looks at it and he says to himself that '95 is going to be the end. It's a 
matter that his time has come." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Chavez: "I know there's been a great deal of criticism over my last few 
fights. But why? First of all, I'm a human being. I never said I was a robot or 
some sort of super being. . . . Remember that the greats have lost: Muhammad 
Ali, Sugar Ray Leonard, Marvin Hagler. So why all this criticism that I should 
retire? 
</P>
<P>
 "I recognize I'm older. But I'm still good." 
</P>
<P>
 Their first fight here in March of 1990 seemed to freeze Taylor in place as 
the man who couldn't quite get it done. But for Chavez, it was a launching 
point to his years as boxing's highest-paid non-heavyweight. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing on all three scorecards, Chavez finally caught and pummeled Taylor in 
the middle of the 12th and final round, then landed a massive right hook that 
caught Taylor on the chin, knocking him backward against the ropes. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor was up by referee Richard Steele's count of five, but was obviously 
still hazy when he glanced over at his then-trainer Lou Duva. That hesitation, 
plus the fog in Taylor's eyes, prompted Steele to stop the fight, giving Chavez 
a technical knockout victory with two seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, Taylor had some success, winning a share of the welterweight title 
three fights later, and some major failures, getting knocked out by Terry 
Norris and Crisanto Espana in consecutive 1992 bouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody judges me on just two fights," Taylor says. "That's not fair. Look 
at what I've done in my career, and judge me on that." 
</P>
<P>
 Between the Espana knockout and the beginning of 1994, Taylor (32-3-1, 18 KOs) 
had only one bout and had ballooned to more than 180 pounds. On his recent 
comeback, after signing with Don King, Taylor has scored two quick knockouts 
over journeymen and returned to the 140-pound class. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, 27, has predicted an eighth-round knockout of Chavez, which is sure to 
inspire the expected sellout crowd, which will be made up mostly of Mexican 
holiday travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 Emanuel Steward, Chavez's trainer and longtime trainer of Thomas Hearns, 
recognizes the dangers Taylor poses -- whether or not he is past his prime. 
Steward compares the situation to Hearns' feelings heading into his 
long-awaited rematch with Sugar Ray Leonard, when everyone considered Hearns a 
shot fighter. The rematch was ruled a draw, although most observers believe 
Hearns controlled the bout. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a fighter gets a chance at a fight that he never thought he'd ever get, 
he's a different fighter than he's been to that point," Steward says. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he gets the man who's been haunting him for years, you've got to throw 
all that out, if he's shot or whatever. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is somebody who is going to be coming in with emotion and with four 
years of memories."

MORNING BRIEFING: ROBERT MORRIS IS MAKING UP FOR LOST TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Robert Morris College of Coraopolis, Pa., playing in its first football game 
in the 73-year history of the school on Sept. 3, might have established another 
first. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colonials defeated another Pennsylvania school, Waynesburg College, 24-19, 
with an epic goal-line stand -- eight plays and no score. 
</P>
<P>
 Waynesburg had a first down at the three-yard line, but couldn't score. On 
fourth down, though, Robert Morris was called for pass interference, giving 
Waynesburg four more downs from the two-yard-line. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, Robert Morris held, stopping three running plays and breaking up a 
pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Add Robert Morris: Joe Walton, Robert Morris coach and former coach of the New 
York Jets, got a sideline dousing at the end of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never had one before," Walton said. "It was kind of nice. I think it was 
water. We can't afford Gatorade at Robert Morris." 
</P>

 SportsLetter of the Amateur Athletic Foundation of Los Angeles reports that it 
is the Alomar brothers, Roberto of Toronto and Sandy Jr. of Cleveland, who 
combined will lose $39,344 in daily salary.  
</P>
<P>
 Next on the sibling list are the Maddux brothers, pitchers Greg of Atlanta and 
Mike of the New York Mets, who lose a combined $25,957 daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Opinion: Bob Smizik, in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: "College administrators, 
like William DeLauder of Delaware State, who suggest that a score of 410 
(that's one correct answer) on the Scholastic Aptitude Test should be good 
enough to allow a student freshman athletic eligibility belong in another line 
of work. 
</P>
<P>
 "A student who scores 410 on his SAT shouldn't be allowed out of high school, 
let alone into college."

 Too wordy: The America's Cup organizers in San Diego are shooting for a 
record: the longest name for an event in the history of sports. 
</P>
<P>
 The real racing starts in January, but the tuneup event Oct. 27-Nov. 5 has 
been dubbed the (take a deep breath) "1994 International America's Cup Class 
Canterbury of New Zealand World Championship." 
</P>
<P>
 That might use up half the space most publications allot for reporting the 
event.

<P>
 Wait a minute: Wayne Lockwood of the San Diego Union-Tribune, commenting on 
San Diego State's 22-20 upset of California last Saturday:  
</P>
<P>
 "Make no mistake, this was a huge victory. Cal is a very, very good football 
team." 
</P>
<P>
 So good that Cal was picked to finish fifth in the Pacific 10 Conference in a 
preseason media poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Overconfident: Damon Huard, Washington Husky quarterback, on his position: "I 
don't know where else I could play. I'm too slow. I can't hit. I'm just a 
weasel quarterback. Maybe I could be a holder."

DUCKS SEND 10 TO SAN DIEGO, INCLUDING DEFENSEMAN FERNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks trimmed their roster to 30 Friday, assigning 10 players to 
San Diego, among them defenseman Mark Ferner, who played 50 games with the 
Ducks last season. 
</P>
<P>
 With the acquisition of veteran Tom Kurvers and first-round pick Oleg 
Tverdovsky, Ferner was caught in a throng of 15 defensemen fighting for what 
could be seven positions.Nine defensemen remain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a really tough decision," General Manager Jack Ferreira said. "You can 
always bring him back. . . . There's still some other guys we're just taking a 
longer look at. We've got to make a decision on them, and we've just got the 
five (exhibition) games left." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferner, 29, scored his first three NHL goals last season, but had a plus-minus 
rating of -16 in his first full season in the NHL. He spent the second half of 
the season in and out of the lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Others players demoted were goalie John Tanner, defensemen Jason Marshall and 
Scott Chartier, and forwards Dean Ewen, Maxim Bets, Scott McKay, Brian 
Sullivan, Craig Reichert and Jean Francois Jomphe. 
</P>
<P>
 The team also faces some difficult decisions on forwards, with 17 remaining on 
the roster and perhaps 14 positions available. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Rucchin, a 6-foot-3 center from the University of Western Ontario whom 
the Ducks picked in the supplemental draft, has been impressive in camp and 
survived the cut. However, that could be in part because the Ducks cannot 
assign him to San Diego until he is under contract, and he has not yet agreed 
to terms. ROBYN NORWOOD

MCNALL FACES CREDITORS, DECLINES QUESTIONING; HOCKEY: FORMER KING OWNER CITES 
FIFTH AMENDMENT RIGHT IN REGARD TO INQUIRIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN and JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 King President Bruce P. McNall met Friday with his creditors for the first 
time since entering bankruptcy proceedings in May but declined to shed light on 
his finances because of an ongoing criminal investigation into his banking 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
 A significant portion of the two-hour hearing, which was held to allow 
creditors to ask McNall questions, included inquiries as to whether McNall has 
held or continues to hold assets in foreign countries such as Switzerland or 
Liechtenstein. 
</P>
<P>
 McNall repeatedly declined to answer questions from the bankruptcy trustee 
attorney, Leonard L. Gumport, and French bank Credit Lyonnais attorney Robert 
Meyer, asserting his Fifth Amendment right. 
</P>
<P>
 As previously reported by The Times, McNall has agreed to plead guilty to four 
criminal counts stemming from a federal bank fraud investigation. Sources say 
the plea probably will be formally entered no earlier than October because 
federal prosecutors are busy completing plea agreements from other McNall 
business associates. 
</P>
<P>
 The ongoing federal investigation precluded McNall from answering questions 
about his financial history and topics such as bank accounts and wire 
transfers. McNall is known to have had Swiss bank accounts in the past when he 
made frequent trips to Switzerland as part of his international coin 
businesses. Gumport on Friday questioned McNall about documents showing a wire 
transfer of funds totaling $1 million from an account at First Los Angeles Bank 
to an account at Union Bank of Switzerland in September of 1993. The 
transaction was authorized by three former McNall employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The line of questions over European funds seemed to annoy McNall's attorneys. 
McNall's criminal attorney, Tom Pollack, said after the hearing that R. Todd 
Neilson, the trustee, is being given access to all McNall records requested. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollack accused Meyer of "trying to embarrass Bruce with his questions" about 
the foreign bank accounts and a Las Vegas trip in May. Meyer asked McNall 
whether he gambled or had a line of casino credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyer said: "We're not into trying embarrass anybody. The only concern is 
finding out Mr. McNall's assets and liabilities and how he has spent his money 
in the past. If there are bank accounts overseas -- which they seem to want to 
guard with the Fifth Amendment -- we want to know about them." 
</P>
<P>
 Credit Lyonnais, which financed McNall's ill-fated venture into movie 
producing and claims it is owed about $120 million, has been the most 
aggressive creditor. In May, the bank publicly accused McNall of defrauding the 
bank -- including offering as collateral assets pledged to another bank -- on 
the eve of McNall's sale of 72% of the Kings to investors Jeffrey P. Sudikoff 
and Joseph M. Cohen. McNall's lawyers have denied those accusations. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, McNall's lawyers are locked in a dispute with Neilson over control 
of a special creditors' trust set up before he entered bankruptcy proceedings, 
one designed to disperse funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The complicated trust contains a lien on McNall assets formerly held by Bank 
of America, which was his primary bank before he sold a majority interest of 
the Kings. One reason the issue of control is considered important is that 
whoever controls the trust would ultimately control the fate of McNall's 
remaining 28% stake in the Kings, and would have the power to sell it at some 
point.

PLAYERS MAKE COUNTERPROPOSAL TO NHL'S PLAN TO LIMIT WAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The NHL Players Assn., during five hours of bargaining Friday in New York, 
presented a proposal that plays off of the league's "luxury tax" plan, which 
would impose payroll limits on clubs but would eliminate arbitration and 
greatly loosen restrictions on free agency. NHL officials agreed to examine the 
concept during the weekend and prepare a response for their next meeting, which 
could take place within days. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources among the clubs' and players' camps characterized the session as 
amicable and indicated they will continue negotiating. The previous labor 
agreement expired Sept. 15, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned about rising salaries, the NHL has sought ways to control costs and 
put large- and small-market teams on equal footing. The luxury tax idea 
proposed by Commissioner Gary Bettman would put a ceiling on payrolls and 
penalize clubs that exceed the limit. However, it would also modify current 
restraints on free agency and eliminate the unpredictable arbitration process. 
</P>
<P>
 Players have rejected two proposals that included salary limits and remain 
opposed to the idea, an NHLPA source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants offered few details about the players' counterproposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mike Gartner of the Toronto Maple Leafs, the NHLPA's president: "This 
proposal is extremely different from any that we've presented in the past. We 
looked at their concerns . . . and tried to address them. We believe we have." 
</P>
<P>
 The NHL also announced terms of an agreement with the International Ice Hockey 
Federation outlining plans for NHL players to participate in the 1998 Olympics 
in Nagano, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement compels teams to release players for the World Championships 
unless games conflict with the Stanley Cup playoffs and stipulates that each 
team will pay the IIHF $400,000 in each of the next three years as compensation 
for signing European players. The NHLPA must ratify the agreement before it 
takes effect.

SADDLEBACK REACHES OUT AND TOUCHES HINCHEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shad Hinchen didn't do a great deal of research before deciding to come to 
Saddleback College in the fall of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 He had no idea of the Gauchos' tradition of success, including being named the 
J.C. Grid-Wire national champions in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he bases his entire decision on which college returned a phone call 
first. 
</P>
<P>
 Hinchen was a standout tailback and defensive back at Indio High School. He 
was the Desert Valleys League's most valuable player as a senior. He also was a 
standout guard on the basketball team for three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Hinchen's football skills got the attention of several four-year colleges, 
including Arizona State and Utah, but he didn't have a good enough score on his 
college entrance test to be eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 So he had to consider community colleges. He and his parents decided he should 
go to college in a new area. His high school coach made calls to several area 
colleges, but Saddleback's Don Butcher, the linebacker coach, was the first to 
call back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said I was going to the first place that called me back," Hinchen said. "I 
didn't care where it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Hinchen moved into an apartment in Mission Viejo last August and started 
practicing. He almost instantly became a key part of Saddleback's defensive 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
 At cornerback, he had 40 tackles, three interceptions and a sack. 
</P>
<P>
 Saddleback also experimented with him at wide receiver at times but Hinchen 
prefers defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "At cornerback it's all up to you," Hinchen said. "On offense you have to 
depend on too many other people." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides his success on the football field, Hinchen is doing well in the 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 He took three classes during the summer and if he passes the 18 units he's 
enrolled in this semester, he will earn his two-year degree a semester early. 
This will allow him to transfer to a four-year college for the spring semester, 
which will improve his recruiting situation dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it hurt me more to see my mom disappointed ," Hinchen said about not 
being eligible for a scholarship out of high school. "For me it wasn't that big 
a deal; I was young and didn't really understand what it all meant."

<P>
 In tonight's 7 o'clock Mission Conference games: 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach (1-0) at Saddleback (0-0) -- Saddleback is coming off a 5-5 season. 
Long Beach opened the season with a 35-14 victory over Golden West. Aron 
Garcia, a sophomore from Irvine High, will start at quarterback for Gauchos. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena (1-0) vs. Golden West (0-1), Orange Coast -- Overall, Golden West 
played pretty well in the 35-14 loss to Long Beach last week, but the Rustlers 
were done in by five turnovers. Golden West outgained Long Beach, 346-313, and 
led in first downs, 23-15. Pasadena led Orange Coast, 24-0, but needed a 
last-second field goal to win, 27-25. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange Coast (0-1) at Cerritos (0-0) -- Orange Coast will switch to 
quarterback Matt Sauk this week. Sauk came into game in the second half against 
Pasadena and completed five of six passes for 95 yards and two touchdowns. He 
also rushed for one score.

LATE PREP COACH'S WORDS STOKE KENELEY'S COMPETITIVE FIRE; FOOTBALL: USC LINEMAN 
STRIVES TO BE THE BEST, USING THE ADVICE OF MIKE RUSH TO INSPIRE HIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There were bloodstains on his pants, several cuts and bruises on his arms and 
calves, and his thumbnail would have matched a Minnesota Viking home jersey 
quite nicely. 
</P>
<P>
 As USC defensive lineman Matt Keneley sauntered off the field last week, 
thoroughly exhausted from a grueling practice, his options seemed pretty clear: 
a dip in the whirlpool, a wrap session with a few ice packs, a long, cool 
shower, or all of the above. 
</P>
<P>
 So where did Keneley go? Straight to the weight room to work out for another 
half-hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could have gone to the training room and relaxed, but I wanted to get a 
little extra work in," said Keneley, a sophomore nose tackle. "It's not 
something I was in the mood to do. It's a sacrifice. But for the good of the 
team and myself, it's something I had to do." 
</P>
<P>
 To understand why Keneley would inflict further punishment on his weary body, 
one must go back to 1989, his sophomore year at Mission Viejo, when former 
Diablo Coach Mike Rush, who died last year of a heart attack, spoke the words 
that still inspire Keneley. 
</P>
<P>
 What you gave today, you'll have forever. What you didn't give today is lost 
forever.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's true with everything in life," said Keneley, a public administration 
major with a 3.58 grade-point average. "You can't go half speed in practice and 
expect good things to happen on Saturday. So I give everything I have, and in 
the long run that will make me a better player. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I come off the practice field bloody, sweaty and feeling like 
crap, because if I'm not trying to improve myself, I wouldn't be where I am." 
</P>
<P>
 Keneley is in the middle of a young USC defensive line that is trying to fend 
off opponents and critics. 
</P>
<P>
 The line was considered a soft spot on last year's 8-5 Trojan team, allowing 
six teams to rush for 200 yards or more, including 305 to Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 USC Coach John Robinson said during the off-season that the line needed to get 
tougher, and he hoped a switch from a read-and-react style to a more 
speed-oriented, attacking style would improve the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 But the results after two games have been mixed. The Trojans did a decent job 
against Washington and standout tailback Napoleon Kaufman in a 24-17 
season-opening victory. The speedy Kaufman had 152 yards, but it took him 26 
carries to do it. He had no game-breaking runs, and the Huskies had only 164 
total rushing yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came last Saturday's disaster. Penn State, behind running back Ki-Jana 
Carter and quarterback Kerry Collins, rolled up 286 yards rushing and 248 yards 
passing in a 38-14 blowout of USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Keneley, who started nine games as a redshirt freshman last season, had a 
career-high nine tackles against Penn State, but that was hardly consolation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it would be a stern test, a chance to find out how good we are, but 
as it turned out, we're not as far along as we hoped," said Keneley, a 
6-foot-5, 280-pounder who had 41 tackles, including two sacks, in 1993. "But I 
think it's too early to label our defense (as being soft against the run). 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can look back at the end of the year and say this was a game where we 
realized we needed to take a step up in preparation and play in order to be a 
top-10 team, then a positive can come out of what would appear to be a huge 
negative." 
</P>
<P>
 Keneley, who despite being a sophomore is the most experienced player on the 
Trojan defensive line, took a major step up during the off-season. As Penn 
State '94 will be for his teammates, Notre Dame '93 was a sobering experience 
for Keneley, one that motivated him all winter, spring and summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "That game really showed us how important it was for us to be more physically 
dominant up front," Keneley said. "I sat down after the season, reflected on 
the games we lost, and attributed a large part of it to the defensive line not 
getting off blocks, not stopping the run. I decided to be the best player I 
could be, I had to change my body and improve my skills." 
</P>
<P>
 Keneley hit the weight room with an unprecedented zeal, adding more muscle 
mass and upper-body strength. He worked with Laguna Hills speed coach Jim 
Walsh, who helped Keneley lower his 40-yard dash times from 5.1 seconds to 
about 4.8 seconds and also refined his techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 "Plus, I took the mind-set that I have a great opportunity to take my career 
where I want it," Keneley said. "The worst thing I could do is waste my talent. 
That's why when I go to practice I don't worry about injuries. I do worry about 
having regrets, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to say I could have been All-Pac-10 or All-American. I want to 
leave everything on the field. I decided I want to be one of the premier 
players in the league, if not this year maybe next year." 
</P>
<P>
 That attitude was apparent to USC coaches, who consider Keneley one of the 
team's most improved returning players. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made huge strides with his physical and mental conditioning," said USC 
defensive line coach Doug Smith, the former Ram center. "He refuses to be 
beaten. He's always been a tough-minded guy, but this year he seems obsessed 
with beating the opponent." 
</P>
<P>
 Keneley, a Times All-Orange County first-team selection in 1991, thrives on 
that competition in the trenches, where linemen have been known to do anything 
-- kick, scratch, bite, trip, hold -- to gain an advantage. He doesn't consider 
himself a violent guy, but violence is one of the most alluring aspects of the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm basically punching (the offensive lineman) in the chest every play," 
Keneley said. "It's an absolute war for four quarters, and the guy who competes 
every play is going to win, and I love that. I've always found that exciting. 
There's no other thing that can give me the same feeling."

NELSON BOUTS LINK GABRIEL RUELAS, LEIJA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gabriel Ruelas got to Azumah Nelson first, but couldn't finish him off. Jesse 
James Leija got Nelson next, and, after a draw, convincingly ended boxing's 
longest reign last May in their rematch. 
</P>
<P>
 So now, Sylmar's Ruelas (38-2, 21 knockouts) and Leija will fight tonight on 
the Julio Cesar Chavez-Meldrick Taylor undercard at the MGM Grand Garden for 
Leija's World Boxing Council junior-lightweight title. And Azumah Nelson is the 
name both fighters mention to bolster their cases. 
</P>
<P>
 After piling up an early lead, Ruelas seemed to lose focus, then lost a 
decision to Nelson in February of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel much more comfortable, much more relaxed than the first title fight," 
said Ruelas, who will earn $200,000 for the bout. "I guess it's the experience. 
It's not that I was nervous the first one against Nelson, it's just that you 
get anxious." 
</P>
<P>
 Leija, after piling up an early lead in September of 1993, coasted in the late 
rounds, and Nelson got a draw. Then, last May, the crafty, counterpunching 
Leija corrected his mistake and defeated Nelson by unanimous decision for the 
WBC belt. 
</P>
<P>
 "You take Azumah Nelson away from both our records and Ruelas hasn't fought 
anybody even close to what I've fought," Leija said. "I think that's in his 
mind, and I think that's going to play a big part in this fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ruelas, he's always coming forward, he's always charging. He throws his 
punches wide. He's always trying to knock you out with that left hook, just 
like Azumah." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruelas, 24, who is seeking to join his brother, Rafael, the International 
Boxing Federation lightweight champion, as brother world champions, concedes 
that he hasn't fought nearly as many contenders as the 28-year-old Leija has, 
and says he hopes Leija, who will earn $400,000, is taking him lightly. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want excuses, you can always find them," said Ruelas, emphasizing that 
he has proved he can overcome anything by coming back from a broken elbow in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fine, you say you've fought more name guys. Yeah, he has. But in a way that's 
helping me, because why would he train hard for a guy who hasn't fought the 
guys he's fought?" 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Goossen, Ruelas' trainer, pointing to Leija's background as a 126-pounder, 
says that his fighter, who weighs in the 140s when he's not in training, is too 
strong for the champion. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's bigger, stronger," Goossen said. "I think you're going to see Leija 
giving Gabriel a lot of respect. I just think Gabriel's that much stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 Other title bouts on the pay-per-view card: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Former WBC junior-welterweight champion Frankie Randall (49-3-1, 39 KOs) 
vs. World Boxing Assn. champion Juan Coggi (66-2-2, 40 KOs): Randall was a 17-1 
underdog who ended Chavez's unbeaten string last January, then appeared well on 
his way to making it two for two last May when a bizarre head-butt stoppage 
gave Chavez back the title. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall, 32, desperately wants another chance to beat Chavez again, but 
promoter Don King has chosen to put that one off for a while, promising Randall 
a third fight in December or January if he beats the left-handed Coggi, 33, and 
Chavez beats Meldrick Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 -- WBC welterweight champion Felix Trinidad (23-0, 19 KOs) vs. No. 1 contender 
Yory Boy Campas (56-0, 50 KOs): Trinidad, 21, is coming off a nine-month layoff 
but is one of the most talented, hardest-hitting young champions in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Campas, 23, has never faced anyone at Trinidad's level, he has been too 
rough and too persistent for everybody previously.

DE LA HOYA HAS VIRUS, CANCELS FIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oscar De La Hoya has been forced to cancel the first defense of his World 
Boxing Organization lightweight title, on Oct. 8 against John Avila, because of 
a virus. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's feeling very weak and has been unable to train for at least a week," 
said De La Hoya's trainer, Robert Alcazar. 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya (14-0, 13 knockouts) and Avila (19-1-1, 11 knockouts) were to have 
fought at the Grand Olympic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 The bout might be rescheduled for Nov. 18, when De La Hoya was scheduled to 
fight an opponent to be named on the Roy Jones-James Toney undercard.

GOLF ROUNDUP; U.S. TEAM OPENS WIDE LEAD IN PRESIDENTS CUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first day of the first Presidents Cup had all the drama of a presidential 
landslide as the United States opened a 7 1/2-2 1/2 lead over an International 
team in Friday's four-ball and foursome play at Gainesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Play started nearly two hours late because of fog but nearly ended early when 
the U.S. team swamped the foreigners on the first nine holes of four-ball play 
and took all five morning matches, holding off an International charge led by 
Nick Price. 
</P>
<P>
 Things got only slightly better in the afternoon for the International team, 
which lost the first two matches to go down, 7-0, before salvaging two 
victories and a tie in the final three. 
</P>
<P>
 There are still 22 more points at stake -- 10 in today's four-ball and 
foursome play and 12 in Sunday's individual matches. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt like our guys were playing well going in and they've proven it, not 
so much by the standings but by the number of birdies there have been," U.S. 
co-captain Paul Azinger said after the four-ball play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Birdies were flying around so fast I felt like I was in a duck blind," said 
American Jim Gallagher, who teamed with John Huston in four-ball to birdie six 
holes on the front nine, including the last five. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-ball match of Davis Love and Fred Couples against Bradley Hughes and 
Price had only two holes of the first 15 in which there was not at least one 
birdie. 
</P>
<P>
 To show how good the Americans were, the worst round by an American team on 
the front nine of the morning four-ball, or better-ball, play was a four-under 
32, by Phil Mickelson and Tom Lehman. Jay Haas and Scott Hoch shot 31, the 
teams of Corey Pavin-Jeff Maggert and Huston-Gallagher each shot 30, and 
Love-Couples birdied seven of the first nine holes and shot 29. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Sluman shot a 68 and retained a one-stroke lead after two rounds of the 
B.C. Open at Endicott, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Sluman, who came within a stroke of the course record with a 63 on Thursday, 
completed two rounds at 11-under 131, one stroke better than Mike Sullivan, who 
shot a 67. Robin Freeman, whose 65 was the best round of the day among the 
leaders, pulled to within two shots at 133. He was joined by Glen Day, who shot 
a 69. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Albus and Jimmy Powell each shot six-under 66s to share the opening-round 
lead in the Bank One Classic at Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
 DeWitt Weaver, who won the tournament in 1991, and Dale Douglass, runner-up 
the last two years, tied for third with 67s. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Ferree, Mike Hill, Dick Hendrickson, Charles Coody, Dave Eichelberger and 
Gay Brewer were at 68. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-time champion Rives McBee was among seven players at 69. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Betsy King, still one elusive victory away from joining the LPGA Hall of Fame, 
shot a four-under-par 68 to take a one-shot lead in the second round of the 
Safeco Classic in Kent, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 King's 68 gave her a 137 total. Britain's Alison Nicholas, who also shot a 68, 
was a shot off the pace at 138 along with Michelle Estill. 
</P>
<P>
 First-round leader Annika Sorenstam and Rosie Jones were tied at five-under 
139.

 * THROW THIS BACK: As part of the NFL's 75th anniversary celebration, this 
weekend's games will feature a venerable institution that has weathered all 
sorts of societal changes to remain an integral part of this league: 
</P>
<P>
 The marketing scam. 
</P>
<P>
 In what is being sold as "Throwbacks Weekend," every team in the league will 
wear uniforms from the past. Some will wear these uniforms again until every 
team has a chance to wear them in front of their home crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 Think of the atmosphere! Think of the nostalgia! 
</P>
<P>
 Think of the licensing revenue that will be pouring in once the souvenir sales 
of these uniforms have been completed! 
</P>
<P>
 The most interesting outfits belong to the Pittsburgh Steelers, who will face 
the Indianapolis Colts while wearing jerseys adorned with a logo that looks 
like a castle. 
</P>
<P>
 It is supposed to be a shield that was once on the city flag. The castle 
represents Ft. Duquesne and Ft. Pitt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers will look like 53 face cards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man, they're ugly," said cornerback Rod Woodson. "I'm glad I don't have to 
play in those things every day. I'd have to change teams or something." 
</P>
<P>
 * DISTRACTIONS? WHAT DISTRACTIONS? The San Francisco 49ers will shut up and 
put up with Deion Sanders' boom box and high step because: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In Sanders' 11 games last season, he made seven interceptions, a figure 
reached by a 49er cornerback only once in the last decade. 
</P>
<P>
 -- During his five NFL seasons, Sanders has scored eight touchdowns on 
interceptions and kick returns, compared to seven by the 49ers' entire team 
during that time. 
</P>
<P>
 One more thought on the do-ragged one. 
</P>
<P>
 How meaningless have NFL contracts become when a man can turn down $17 million 
with one team, the New Orleans Saints, to sign for $1.1 million elsewhere? 
</P>
<P>
 * SUB-HUMAN OF THE WEEK: It's hard to ignore this quote from Raider linebacker 
Winston Moss, who was captured on videotape trying to remove the face of 
Seattle Seahawk quarterback Rick Mirer while Mirer was lying on the Coliseum 
turf last Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a cheap shot unless you get caught," Moss said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a great role model for the sport. Such a wonderful lesson for our 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Moss reportedly will be released by the Raiders next season when the league 
institutes an idiot cap.

<P>
 * IT FIGURES: Jimmy Johnson, while doing his homework for his new job as a Fox 
pregame announcer, is said to be having difficulty gleaning inside info from 
former colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Many are apparently afraid that when he becomes a coach again next season, he 
will use that information against them. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHILE WE'RE ON THE SUBJECT: One early line on where Johnson will coach next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 1. San Francisco 49ers: You think not? Let George Siefert fail to take that 
team to the Super Bowl and see how long he lasts. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Philadelphia Eagles: New owner Jeffrey Lurie is fascinated with Johnson, 
and can offer Johnson the right money and right division. If only he had the 
right weather. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Tampa Bay Buccaneers: Johnson would have gone to Jacksonville if the 
Panthers had not panicked and hired Tom Coughlin before Johnson left Dallas. So 
why wouldn't he go right across the state? 
</P>
<P>
 The organization is a mess, but the best coach in the world has seen that 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 * WERE WE THE ONLY ONES WHO KNEW THIS WOULD HAPPEN? On the eve of last week's 
game in Dallas between the Cowboys and Houston Oilers, Barry Switzer could not 
be found at the Cowboy team meetings. Or at their hotel. Or even in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Switzer had high-tailed it to Arkansas to see his son Doug play quarterback 
for Missouri Southern. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did Switzer clear his absence with the team before he left, he flew 
on owner Jerry Jones' private plane. 
</P>
<P>
 Wonder who sat in Switzer's seat at those meetings? 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea of a guy in there, running a projector until midnight, looking for 
that edge to win . . . that's Hollywood," Switzer told reporters. "Those things 
don't happen."

PRO FOOTBALL / BILL PLASCHKE; TROUBLE ARRIVES EARLY FOR CARDINALS, OILERS AND 
SAINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Trouble in the NFL is like a blitzing linebacker. One who comes from the blind 
side. One who hides behind a defensive end, then sneaks around his backside and 
sprints at your face and. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 One moment you are standing there, your entire world in sight, the 
possibilities endless. 
</P>
<P>
 The next moment you are swallowing somebody's jersey and feeling for your 
toes. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches take their meals in film rooms and players spend their summer 
vacations camped beneath large metal weights. Yet they cannot predict it or 
stop it or even guess from where it is coming. 
</P>
<P>
 In the NFL, trouble just happens. 
</P>
<P>
 In three spots this season it has happened with stunning quickness. 
</P>
<P>
 Blame it on the emotions caused by the new labor agreement. Blame it on the 
increased pressures of greater visibility that came with the premature end of 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 A rookie gives a veteran some lip, and a fight occurs. An offensive 
coordinator doesn't look at the scoreboard, and a controversy ensues. 
</P>
<P>
 A new coach makes an impulsive personnel decision, and his new friends start 
behaving like old enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes in this game, you prepare to a fight a left-handed boxer," said 
Jeff Fisher, defensive coordinator for the Houston Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 He paused. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then you get out there and the guy is right-handed." 
</P>
<P>
 A rundown on the league's three unhappiest spots: HE'S STILL MAC THE KNIFE 
</P>
<P>
 Some guessed that Jim McMahon would weasel his way past Steve Beuerlein and 
become the Arizona Cardinals' starting quarterback by midseason. 
</P>
<P>
 They were wrong by nearly two months. 
</P>
<P>
 This change already has occurred -- it was announced Wednesday by offensive 
dunderhead Buddy Ryan -- even though Beuerlein set a club record last season by 
completing 61.7% of his passes. 
</P>
<P>
 And even though Beuerlein had not even been given the opportunity to start 
more than the first two games this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The sudden quarterback controversy adds to the woes of a winless team that 
leads the league in defense, as expected, but is dead last in offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Moore, who rushed for 1,018 yards last year, can't figure out how to play 
in a two-back set. Receiver Gary Clark can't stay sound, and receiver Randal 
Hill gets lost running deep. 
</P>
<P>
 And now Ryan has panicked and gone with McMahon, who is 35 with a right arm 
that looks at least twice that old. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so Beuerlein was last in the league in passing efficiency at 45.2%. He has 
played five quarters . 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing that wins in the NFL is patience, but with this new system, I don't 
know if you'll ever see that again," said Greg Davis, Arizona kicker and league 
philosopher. "I like Steve and think he's a franchise quarterback. I'm 
surprised as anybody to see him benched. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got off to the same start last year. Unfortunately, Buddy has no history 
with him." 
</P>
<P>
 The normally affable Beuerlein refused some interview requests but told local 
reporters: "I don't agree with the situation. I don't like the situation. 
Everyone who knows me . . . they all know I've always been able to bounce back 
from a bad pass, a bad quarter, a bad game. I'm sure this situation would have 
been no different." 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, the Cardinals are even mouthier than ever. When asked 
about Sunday's game in Cleveland against the Browns, defensive end Michael 
Bankston said: "We'll beat Cleveland for sure. We're going to beat the 
Cleveland Browns in the Dawg Pound. We're going to turn it into a bird house." 
JACK'S LAST STAND 
</P>
<P>
 Does anybody else think the Houston Oilers might not win three games this 
year? 
</P>
<P>
 It was thought they might get off to a slow start, but who could have figured 
that they would have a quarterback controversy this quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 And that their offensive and defensive coordinators would be at odds this 
fast. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with Ryan long gone? 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Gilbride, recipient of a Ryan punch last season, asked for it again last 
week in a 20-17 loss to the Dallas Cowboys when he called an important play 
thinking it was first down. 
</P>
<P>
 Problem was, it was third down. A pass failed. The Oilers punted. The Cowboys 
took the ball from near midfield into Oiler territory for what became a 
game-deciding field goal just before halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Walking off the field, Gilbride and Fisher had words, although both denied it 
publicly, even though the television cameras had caught it. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's the least of their problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The public wants Bucky Richardson to be the quarterback, but the coaching 
staff wants Cody Carlson as long as he can avoid injury, which seems to be 
about 10 minutes at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 They not only miss Warren Moon, they miss Sean Jones and William Fuller and 
Wilber Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
 And they have a first-place schedule that includes games against the New York 
Giants and Jets, Kansas City Chiefs, Philadelphia Eagles and the Buffalo Bills 
on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a different team than it was last year, with a different group of 
leaders, a new quarterback, then a newer one after that," Fisher said. "We've 
got to have somebody take over the leadership role. We're just kind of 
wandering right now. We need somebody to get in somebody's face mask when 
they're not working." 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher thought back to what it was like when he was an assistant with the San 
Francisco 49ers last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember in practice where every wide receiver ran down and scored on every 
play, every running back ran 60 yards to score every time he touched the ball, 
even when the play was stopped they kept running," Fisher said. "It's all about 
an attitude. Something we're working on here." 
</P>
<P>
 If you are Coach Jack Pardee, you also might want to work on a resume. Like, 
now. JIM MORA'S FUTURE ALSO WIRED SHUT? 
</P>
<P>
 After "It's still early," this has been the most repeated statement by losing 
teams this season: 
</P>
<P>
 "At least we're not the New Orleans Saints." 
</P>
<P>
 The story of their season, which could conceivably end with zero victories 
despite the best intentions of renewed Jim Everett, can be found in a suburban 
New Orleans bar. 
</P>
<P>
 It was early Monday morning, after a 38-24 loss to the sorry Washington 
Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 Running backs Lorenzo Neal and Mario Bates were in the bar, apparently 
commiserating over a running attack that has totaled 65 yards in two games -- 
fewer yards than 25 individual running backs have gained in one game this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey rookie, buy me a beer!" Neal reportedly shouted to Bates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any money," Bates reportedly replied. 
</P>
<P>
 The next sound was Neal's fist connecting with Bates' face. Just when the 
Saints were preparing to move Bates into the starting lineup, he suffered a 
broken jaw and will be sidelined for at least four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Mora, the Saints' coach whose job could be lost with the season, did not 
discipline either player. With Neal not making any carries and Bates walking 
around with a wired-shut jaw, Mora must have figured they were punished enough.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; GRIFFITH GETS SHOT AT FULLBACK DUTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Running back Howard Griffith, who has yet to carry or catch the ball in his 
four years in the game, will replace fullback Tim Lester at times Sunday 
against the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a reward for a player who has been working his tail off," said Chick 
Harris, Ram offensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith, drafted by the Colts in 1991, has been with the Buffalo Bills and 
San Diego Chargers, and last year with the Rams he returned eight kickoffs for 
a 21.9-yard average. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris said Griffith's increased role is not a reflection on Lester's play, 
but Lester dropped a pass to open last week's game and has not been as 
dominating a blocker as he was a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback Todd Lyght, on defending Jerry Rice, who has scored 11 of his 
NFL-record 127 touchdown against the Rams: "It's comparable to going out and 
trying to D-up Michael Jordan. He's going to get some, but you have to make it 
so he's not going to be the game-breaker." . . . Cornerback Steve Israel 
continued to stand on the sideline Friday while Darryl Henley started in his 
place. Coach Chuck Knox, however, declined to say who would start against the 
49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Running back James Bostic, the team's No. 3 draft pick, was put on the 
inactive list for a third consecutive week. Keith Loneker, who is out with a 
foot injury, linebacker Brett Collins and cornerback Dexter Davis will be 
inactive for the 49ers. T.J. SIMERS

SPLASH GETS INTO PLAYOFF TROUBLE AGAIN; SOCCER: ANAHEIM LOSES, 5-4, TO LAS 
VEGAS IN THE OPENING GAME OF THE CISL SEMIFINAL SERIES. IT MUST WIN GAME 2 TO 
AVOID ELIMINATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One would have thought the Splash would have learned its lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach George Fernandez has told his players, over and over: Play like a team. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Las Vegas Dustdevils scored a 5-4 victory in front of 5,758 at 
The Pond on Friday in Game 1 of the best-of-three Continental Indoor Soccer 
League semifinal series, which goes to the Thomas & Mack Center for Game 2 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've done it once," said Splash forward Rod Castro about coming back in a 
series, "but you can only roll seven so many times." 
</P>
<P>
 And now they have to do it in Las Vegas, where the Splash lost, 9-8, in the 
last week of the regular season, 9-8. In that game, the Dustdevils were without 
Branko Segota and Roderick Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, Segota had three goals and Scott had two assists as the Dustdevils 
overcame a two-goal, halftime deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Segota has seven playoff goals. His final goal, 11 minutes 44 seconds into the 
fourth quarter, gave the Dustdevils their first lead and helped them avoid 
their third consecutive overtime game. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's scary. You can't do anything to stop him," said Splash Coach George 
Fernandez, who played alongside Segota in the MISL. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only can he score, but his passing is phenomenal. He can see the field 
with great ease. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past he's been a superstar in the indoor league and that hasn't 
changed one bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Segota wasn't named to the All-CISL team. No Dustdevil made the first or 
second team, while the Splash had two -- defender Ralph Black and midfielder 
Doug Neely. 
</P>
<P>
 Just goes to show that unselfish team play goes a long way. As a result, 
Fernandez's sentences were short after the game: 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't play as a team," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 You would think they learned their lesson? 
</P>
<P>
 "You would think so." 
</P>
<P>
 Why aren't they playing as a team? 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably the pressure, the playoffs," he said. "Everybody wants to be the 
guy. Everybody wants to make the great pass or make the great goal. . . . We're 
trying way too hard individually." 
</P>
<P>
 Did anyone play well? 
</P>
<P>
 There was a long pause before Fernandez reached his conclusion: "I can't think 
of one." 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Splash is in the same position it was against Sacramento in the 
quarterfinals -- in need of a victory on the road to avoid elimination despite 
having the league's second-best record. Las Vegas was third in the Western 
Division. If needed, Game 3 will be Wednesday at The Pond. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're better on the road than at home right now," Fernandez said. "I have no 
idea what goes through some of these guys' minds. They're not listening, 
obviously. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our passing was terrible. We couldn't pass the ball from Point A to Point B." 
</P>
<P>
 At least two Dustdevil goals came after poor passes from the back against Las 
Vegas' pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash has now lost as many games at home in the playoffs as it did during 
the regular season, and it has scored fewer than five goals twice this season 
-- both in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Ervine had a hand in the Splash's first three goals after being limited 
to only two assists in the first three games of the playoffs -- and those came 
in Game 3 against Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 He scored the Splash's first two goals and assisted on the third -- to Armando 
Valdivia -- as the Splash took a 3-1 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, the offense went stale -- only Ralph Black's power-play goal to 
make it 4-3 prevented a second-half shutout. As a result, a season-high 22 
saves by Jorge Valenzuela went for waste. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key to the game was containing Segota and not making stupid mistakes," 
Castro said. "We did neither."

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Raiders haven't yet heard from defensive end Scott Davis, who has been 
AWOL since leaving their training headquarters Sept. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Davis doesn't return, he can plan on hearing from the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 There's this matter of a signing bonus, $1.05 million, received by the 
29-year-old lineman when he signed a four-year, $5.3-million contract this 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 A clause in that contract says that "In the event player . . . leaves club 
without its consent, than player will forfeit any and all portions of the total 
bonus not having been earned." 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, since Davis has played in only one game, and bonuses are 
calculated over a 17-week season, he would be entitled to keep a little less 
than $62,000 of that money. STEVE SPRINGER

 Denver quarterback John Elway's statistics are better than ever under Coach 
Wade Phillips and offensive coordinator Jim Fassell, but over the last two 
seasons, the Broncos have a 0-6 record whenever he has passed for more than 300 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 So will the Raiders see a more conservative Elway? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, they're still the same," Coach Art Shell said about the Bronco offense. 
"They're still trying to go down deep with the ball. In watching film . . . 
(Elway's) still bombing away." 
</P>
<P>
 Elway may be without tight end Shannon Sharpe, doubtful with a shoulder injury 
after missing last week's loss to the New York Jets, and running back Rod 
Bernstein, questionable with a hamstring injury. 
</P>
<P>

 The Raiders will wear replicas of their 1963 Oakland uniforms for Sunday's 
game at Denver in celebration of the NFL's "Throwback Weekend." They will wear 
white jerseys with silver numbers and the Raider helmet insignia will be white 
instead of black. The Broncos will wear replicas of their 1965 uniforms, which 
were orange and blue. LONNIE WHITE

<P>
 A federal appeals court ordered a new trial in a $51-million lawsuit that 
former New England Patriot owner William H. Sullivan won against the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan filed suit against the NFL in May 1991, claiming the league's refusal 
to allow him to sell public stock forced him to sell the team to Victor Kiam in 
October 1988 for what Sullivan considered to be a low price of $84 million.

COMMENTARY; GAME CAN DISAPPOINT ANY OLD JOE, EVEN HOPEFUL NEW YANKEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LUPICA, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He will go to work the week after next, two nights a week as a volleyball 
referee in a recreational league in Kingston, N.Y. Joe Ausanio will make $100 a 
night. When the basketball leagues start up for the Parks and Recreation 
Department in Kingston, he may work some basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 He was supposed to be helping pitch the Yankees to the championship of the 
American League East right now. But he is on strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Ausanio will begin working nights next week, but these were not the kinds 
of September nights he imagined when he finally made it to the big leagues a 
couple of months ago. And October will not be the way he imagined it at all. 
</P>
<P>
 If there had been no strike, Ausanio would have made $18,000 a month for the 
last half of the regular season. It is the minimum salary for a big-league 
ballplayer, but nearly twice as much as Ausanio had ever made for a full season 
in the minors. Instead of a pennant race, he gets volleyball games. His wife, 
Tammy, works three days a week in the Human Resources office of a water 
purification company. They have two children and live in a three-bedroom 
trailer in Kingston, and this week the baseball winter had already begun for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't miss the money, because I never expected to have it in the first 
place," Joe Ausanio was saying, baby-sitting his two boys. "Between Tammy's job 
and me being able to ref, we should be fine. If everything goes OK, we 
shouldn't have to dip into our savings." 
</P>
<P>
 There was a pause and then Ausanio, who kicked around the minors for a long 
time and finally ended up on the mound at Yankee Stadium wearing Goose 
Gossage's No. 54, said, "But I'm not going to lie to you, it's going to be a 
long winter around here. I just hope it doesn't turn into an even longer 
spring." 
</P>
<P>
 Ausanio was asked what will happen next spring if the owners open up training 
camps and wait to see how many players will effectively cross a baseball picket 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I'm the kind of guy they think will come in, because I'm low man on the 
totem pole," Ausanio said. "But I won't go. I'm in the big leagues now, strike 
or no strike. I'm a member of the club." 
</P>
<P>
 If he had worked a whole season for the Columbus Clippers, he would have made 
$30,000. It works out to $6,000 a month, starting in April. Then the Yankees 
called him up after the All-Star break and his salary tripled. It was like 
winning the lottery. When the strike came, the Yankees sent him back to 
Columbus, so he could keep pitching. But at the end of August, they called him 
back up; if the season resumed, they wanted him eligible for the postseason. If 
the Yankees went to the playoffs, Ausanio, who came out of a trailer in 
Kingston and would not quit, would go with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had my dream for a little while," he said. There was a laugh with no fun in 
it anywhere. Ausanio said, "Now I've got to go out and get a job." 
</P>
<P>
 He pitched in 13 games for the Yankees and had a 2-1 record. The earned-run 
average was 5.17, but the Yankees never worried about that for one minute. 
There were a couple of times before the season ended when Ausanio left some 
runners on and the guys who pitched after him let them all score. The Yankees 
were more interested in 15 strikeouts in 15 innings and a fastball that moved 
even more than Ausanio wanted it to sometimes. The manager, Buck Showalter, 
liked him a lot. Everyone around the Yankees did. 
</P>
<P>
 Ausanio had come to the Yankees from the Montreal Expos' organization. The 
Expos had claimed him from the Pittsburgh Pirates. Ausanio was pitcher of the 
year in the Pirate organization once. Then he injured ligaments in his pitching 
arm, and there was one Pirates executive who told him he'd never pitch in the 
big leagues. But Showalter saw something this spring. So did Yankees general 
manager Gene Michael. It was not only fastballs that moved. It had to do 
something with Ausanio's heart. On July 27, at the age of 28, Joe Ausanio 
pitched at Yankee Stadium for the first time. They needed three buses to bring 
everybody down from Kingston. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if the whole thing gets shut down for a long time and there's some 
reason why I never get to pitch in the big leagues again," he said at the time, 
"at least I had some innings. It was finally my turn." 
</P>
<P>
 Now it has all been taken away from him. He has given some thought to winter 
ball. He pitched in Venezuela once before and did pretty well there. He says 
you can make $3,000 a month at least in Venezuela, and sometimes a lot more 
than that. But he would have to be away from his family. Their oldest son, 
Joseph III, 3, was born with bacterial meningitis and is deaf. They have him in 
a special school and the whole family moving to Venezuela for a few months of 
baseball is out of the question. 
</P>
<P>
 Ausanio said, "My wife says I've been away enough." 
</P>
<P>
 He was asked what he will do next spring, if there is still no baseball, still 
no paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that point I'd have to think about doing something else," he said. "Find 
something. . . . " His voice disappeared. He didn't want to know where the 
thought ended up. 
</P>
<P>
 Ausanio does not want anybody to feel sorry for him. He knows that people who 
will never make $30,000 in a year have gone out on strike over issues far more 
important than a baseball salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows how many people are out of work. He believes he has a future now with 
the Yankees, and that is more than he had at the start of the season. It is 
just that his season at Yankee Stadium was much too short. Ausanio, you must 
understand, had decided he was going to the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was never about the money with me," Ausanio said. "All the years in the 
minors, it wasn't about money. I just figure I ended up with $12,000 more this 
season than I thought I was going to make. That's a lot of money in this 
house." 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't about the money, it was about making it into the club. It was 
finally Joe Ausanio's turn. But, on Sept. 26, first night on the job as a ref, 
he will be at the Billy Costello Gym, Midtown Neighborhood Center, in Kingston, 
not in Cleveland to start a three-game series against the Indians.

ORANGE COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PREP EXTRA; MATER DEI MAKES ESPERANZA SICK, 
38-28; FOOTBALL: BODNAR RECOVERS FROM FOOD POISONING TO RUSH FOR 176 YARDS AND 
THREE TOUCHDOWNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Food poisoning couldn't slow Mater Dei running back Steve Bodnar and neither 
could Esperanza, as Bodnar rushed for 176 yards and three touchdowns to lead 
the second-ranked Monarchs to a 38-28 victory in a nonleague game at Valencia 
High Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt a little sick this morning, but I took a lot of fluids and I felt 
excellent out there tonight," said Bodnar, who scored the final touchdown on a 
seven-yard run with 41 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bodnar was almost the goat. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei quarterback John Flynn, who completed 14 of 23 passes for 174 yards, 
seemingly put the game out of reach four minutes into the fourth quarter. After 
he scrambled out of the pocket, he raced 32 yards up the sideline for a 
touchdown and a 31-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-ranked Esperanza (1-1) took the next possession and moved 80 yards in 
seven plays, culminating the drive when Brian Forth turned a short screen pass 
from Chris Stretch into a 26-yard scoring play. 
</P>
<P>
 On Mater Dei's next possession, Bodnar rambled 32 yards but fumbled at the 
Monarch 47, where Jake Franko recovered for Esperanza with 3 minutes 56 seconds 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Stretch, who completed 17 of 29 passes for 219 yards and two touchdowns, moved 
the Aztecs 47 yards in five plays, capping the drive with a perfect 30-yard 
pass to Forth in the corner of the end zone.  
</P>
<P>
 Forth had seven receptions for 113 yards, and his last catch, followed by a 
two-point conversion run by Stretch, pulled Esperanza to within 31-28 with 2:46 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza tried an onside kick, but Peter Campbell recovered for the Monarchs 
at their 49. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little down on myself after the fumble," Bodnar said. "But I just 
wanted to do anything I could to get into the end zone again." 
</P>
<P>
 Bodnar, who scored touchdowns on runs of four and six yards in the first half, 
carried the ball on three consecutive plays before scoring the clincher on the 
fourth one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our offensive line won the game for us tonight," Mater Dei Coach Bruce 
Rollinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Footman was another bright spot for Esperanza. The Aztecs showed signs of life 
in the second half after managing just one touchdown in the first. 
</P>
<P>
 But three Esperanza fumbles recovered by the Monarchs proved costly as Mater 
Dei cashed in on one of the fumbles for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we dominated the first half, but Esperanza has a lot of pride and 
came right back at us," Rollinson said.  
</P>
<P>
 But Rollinson would not get into any discussions as to who the No. 1 team in 
Orange County should be. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's for the media to decide," Rollinson said. "We're not that worried 
about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza Coach Gary Meek also had high praise for the Monarchs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a lot of weapons," Meek said. "Those were two good teams and we 
came out on the short end tonight. But it's a long season. I'd like to see them 
again in the playoffs."

SAILING; CANADA'S ROSS MACDONALD WINS THE STAR WORLD TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICH ROBERTS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nobody expected the wind to blow for the Star class finale at San Diego 
Friday, but folks weren't sure about Canada's Ross MacDonald. Three or four 
times, he had said, the world championship was within his reach only to slip 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 This time he held on, although he admitted it was "pretty stressful." 
</P>
<P>
 With a two-point lead, MacDonald and crewman Eric Jespersen led at the first 
mark, then settled into a seemingly safe second behind 1991 champion Carl 
Buchan, Friday's eventual winner, before their effort started unraveling on the 
last leg in the shifty five-to-six-knot winds. 
</P>
<P>
 MacDonald, 29, of Vancouver, sailed into a pocket of dead air and slipped from 
second to eighth place. He was passed by Brazil's Alan Adler, his nearest rival 
for the title. 
</P>
<P>
 But Adler couldn't put any boats between his and MacDonald's, so the final 
point totals were MacDonald 21, Adler 22. It was the first of the 72 Star 
titles to be won by a Canadian. 
</P>
<P>
 "This beats the Olympics," MacDonald said, with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
 That time, in 1992 at Barcelona, the prize was bronze, not gold, but this 
still would have been better, MacDonald said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Olympics it's only 20 or 30 boats, of which only 10 or 15 are 
competitive," he said. "All the best sailors are here." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Dennis Conner won his third Etchells class world title at Newport Beach 
Friday, virtually by default. 
</P>
<P>
 He and seven-time world champion Dave Curtis of Marblehead, Mass., were the 
only two title contenders left in the 62-boat fleet, and both took 20% scoring 
penalties for premature starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the race, Conner was struggling far back, but Curtis was so much worse 
off that he dropped out at the second windward mark, assuring Conner of the 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 "It reminded me of the first time I won the Star worlds," said Conner, 52. 
"Today was my birthday, and I won the (1971) Star worlds in Seattle on my 
birthday." RICH ROBERTS

ORANGE COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PREP EXTRA; WOODBRIDGE UPSETS NO. 8 FOOTHILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FORREST LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Foothill quarterback Mike Ford almost passed for as many yards as Woodbridge 
gained in total offense. But it didn't affect the final outcome as Woodbridge 
upset eighth-ranked Foothill. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors used two first-half touchdowns and halted a late rally by 
Foothill for a 14-7 nonleague victory Friday night at Tustin High. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge won despite losing starting quarterback Casey Harris and backup 
Ricky Jenkins in the first quarter on consecutive plays. But an inspired effort 
by linebacker Ian Dominelli, who missed last week's opening victory over 
Pacifica because of a wrist injury, keyed the victory for Woodbridge (2-0). 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids showed so much heart," Woodbridge Coach Rick Gibson said. "For any 
team to lose two quarterbacks and stay as focused as we did . . . I'm so proud 
of these guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Harris sprained his left knee on the game's second play. He was replaced by 
Jenkins, who normally starts at running back, but he sustained a broken 
collarbone on the third play. Gibson turned to sophomore Brian Millat, who 
passed for only 39 yards. The Warriors managed 221 yards overall. Ford passed 
for 215, but he and the Knights blew several scoring opportunities.  
</P>
<P>
 A fumbled punt return by Foothill's Tramel Robinson led to a Woodbridge 
touchdown when Theo Wakefield scored on a one-yard run with 2:50 left in the 
first quarter for a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 With 34 seconds remaining in the first half, running back Gavin Crew made it 
14-0, scoring on a two-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill (1-1) finally scored with 2:29 left in the game on Mike Ford's 
seven-yard touchdown pass to Matt Bower to cut the Woodbridge lead to 14-7. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights tried to gain possession again with an on-side kick, but it 
traveled only eight yards as the Warriors took over at the Foothill 43 and ran 
out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a huge win for us," said Dominelli, who also rushed for 84 yards in 
eight carries. "It's enormous." 
</P>
<P>
 The game also marked the debut of Foothill linebacker Ruben Vaughan, who 
transferred from Santa Margarita recently. Vaughan, a sophomore, didn't start.

ORANGE COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PREP EXTRA; THIS TIME, IT'S EDISON'S TURN TO 
DEFEAT CAPISTRANO VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Edison's time had come. Dave White, on the verge of hyperventilating, waded 
through his team, slapping every player he could reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it's only the second week of the season. But the Chargers' 21-17 victory 
over Capistrano Valley at Orange Coast College Friday was greeted with a 
collective sigh of relief. It took a 70-yard run by Bradley Lisotto with a 
minute left, but Edison had finally beaten the Cougars. 
</P>
<P>
 For five years, White had watched in agony as his team went down in flames 
against Capistrano Valley. Sometimes it was a blow out, sometimes a nail-biter. 
This time it didn't happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've lost to them so many times and in so many ways," White said. "I have a 
lot of respect for their program. But it was time for us to beat them." 
</P>
<P>
 They almost didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 That old Cougar magic was on again, like last season when they drove 80 yards 
in the final minute for a 17-13 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 This time the Cougars needed to go only 31 yards to take the lead. Charlie 
Landrigan's three-yard run with 1 minute 53 seconds left put them up and the 
Chargers down. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite outgaining, outplaying and outhitting the Cougars, Edison trailed, 
17-14. 
</P>
<P>
 Things looked worse moments later when the Chargers faced a third and 10. But 
Lisotto broke up the middle on a draw, cut outside, and outran Jeffrey Brion 
for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw a little opening and went for it," Lisotto said. "I just headed for the 
sidelines and ran, ran, ran." 
</P>
<P>
 Said White: We could have quit. We didn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Edison piled up yards and piled up the Cougars' offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Pat Markovsky completed 15 of 21 passes for 162 yards. The 
Chargers also gained 216 yards rushing, 151 by Lisotto. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lisotto and running back Alex Forero each fumbled. Both killed drives deep 
in Capistrano Valley territory. Kevin Bever also missed two 42-yard field 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
 So Capistrano Valley, which had only 124 total yards all night, trailed only, 
7-3, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 "We shot ourselves and shot ourselves," White said. "But our defense was 
unbelievable." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially to those who saw it last week. The Chargers watched, quite 
literally, as Corona del Mar's Brian Hogan gained 272 yards. Edison held on for 
a 35-28 victory, but it didn't inspire confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Chargers shut down Capistrano's all-sophomore backfield, limiting them 
to 41 yards rushing. They confused sophomore quarterback Tim Hirchag with a 
variety of defensive fronts and blitzes. Edison also moved free safety Bryan 
Lachapelle to linebacker, where he made one big play after another. In fact, 
the Cougars' only offense of note was a 77-yard touchdown pass from Hirchag to 
Todd Miller.

ORANGE COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PREP EXTRA; STEIN LEADS NO. 1 LOS ALAMITOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of these days, somebody, somehow will catch those sneaky Los Alamitos High 
football coaches assembling yet another seemingly perfect human quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 And what a happy day it will be for the rest of the Southland's football 
coaches when someone reveals where the Griffins get the parts for these guys, 
because nobody else can find the store. 
</P>
<P>
 Until this whistle-blower emerges, however, the opposition will endure the 
same problems L.A. Washington faced Friday night in Los Alamitos' 38-7 victory 
before 3,000 at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffins (2-0), ranked first in a poll of Orange County sportswriters, 
extended their unbeaten streak to 37. What's more, Los Alamitos' offense ran in 
precision despite the neophyte varsity signal-caller at its controls. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore quarterback Sean Stein, starting in place of injured junior Kevin 
Feterik, completed six of 12 passes for 112 yards with two touchdowns and one 
interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Stein (6 feet 1, 183 pounds) was especially effective in the game's first 24 
minutes, leading Los Alamitos to touchdowns on all five of its possessions. His 
only incompletion of the first half came on his last attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffins eased off in the second half. Mike Phillips' 28-yard field goal 
in the third quarter was the only second-half scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a whole week of practice and it went great," Stein said. "I was really 
confident; wasn't nervous at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Griffin Coach John Barnes was pleased with Stein, who made his 
varsity debut last week after the left-handed Feterik broke a bone in his 
throwing hand in the first half of the Griffins' 24-14 season-opening victory 
over Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would be hard pressed to find a better sophomore quarterback around," 
Barnes said. "He got tons of work this week and he's handled it great." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior receiver Brad Melsby caught four passes for 93 yards and one touchdown. 
Junior receiver Tony Hartley had two catches for 19 yards and one touchdown, 
and intercepted two passes while playing defensive back. Senior running back 
Phil Cruz gained 115 yards in 14 carries and rushed for three touchdowns -- all 
in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Stein was removed from the game with 10 minutes 30 seconds to play in the 
fourth quarter. Many of the Griffins' other starters were relaxing on the 
sidelines for quite a while before Stein arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos outscored Washington, 22-7, to put the game out of reach in the 
first quarter. Los Alamitos actually trailed early, 7-0, thanks to a 
spectacular 91-yard opening kickoff return by Dennis Northcutt and a successful 
point-after kick by Vester Ellison. 
</P>
<P>
 The scoring ended there, though, for Washington (0-2), which was penalized 10 
times for 60 yards in the opening half.

</P>
<P>
 Reuben Droughns, Anaheim running back, gets his toughest test of the season 
next Friday. The Colonists play host to Irvine, three-time Southern Section 
champions, at Glover Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Droughns gained 2,000 yards last season. But the Vaqueros have shut down more 
than one standout running back during the past three seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison and San Clemente, two teams that could be playoff contenders in their 
respective leagues, play at San Clemente Friday night. VICTORY TRIBUTE 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's 14-13 victory over Whittier California Friday was dedicated to 
Jamie Schatz, younger sister of Indian tight end Ryan Schatz, who died just 
before the season began. Jamie Schatz played soccer and volleyball and was the 
sophomore class president. Team members will wear her initials on their helmets 
during the season. OILER JEWELRY 
</P>
<P>
 It's not uncommon to see football boosters sell any number of things to raise 
money for their programs, but personalized jewelry? 
</P>
<P>
 One of the items offered by the Huntington Beach boosters is an orange and 
white wooden necklace made up of of beads, stars and a hand-painted Oiler 
football medallion. Jed Donahue, manning the merchandise table Thursday night, 
offered a personal touch by carefully adding the name and number of a favorite 
player with his paint brush. 
</P>
<P>
 Also for sale: wooden Oiler helmet earrings. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll notice they match," Donahue said. FINDING PAYDIRT 
</P>
<P>
 After being held scoreless for just the third time in 13 years last week, 
Valencia wasted little time finding the end zone Friday night. The Tigers moved 
62 yards in three plays in 1 minute 24 seconds, and scored on a three-yard run 
by Damian Askins on their way to a 27-13 victory over Servite. A LONG 10 YARDS 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda's Matt Kalcevich booted perhaps the most impressive 10-yard punt 
in school history in the Wildcats' 28-7 loss to Villa Park Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 With 20 seconds left in the first half, Kalcevich lined up for a punt at the 
Villa Park 44, but the ball rolled through his legs, all the way to the Brea 
30. Kalcevich scooped up the ball, got chased toward the sidelines by two 
defenders, then, just before he went out of bounds, got off a punt that 
traveled 36 yards in the air, but only counted for 10 on the stat sheet. WHAT A 
PUNT 
</P>
<P>
 Capistrano Valley's Chris Culbertson had an 81-yard punt against Edison 
Friday, the fourth longest punt in Orange County history. Culbertson's kick 
rolled into and out of the end zone for a touchback. 
</P>
<P>
 Culbertson is a 6-foot-1, 210-pound linebacker. UNPLUGGED 
</P>
<P>
 When technical difficulties prevented the national anthem from being sung on 
time at the La Quinta-Estancia game Thursday night at Newport Harbor High, the 
Aztec players took it upon themselves to break into song. 
</P>
<P>
 The players started softly but were booming out the final words much to the 
delight of the small crowd and the Estancia cheerleaders, who offered 
encouragement throughout. ON THE RECORD 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank God for Dwayne." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Scott Orloff, Santa Ana Valley coach, after Dwayne Cherrington rushed for 
279 yards and four touchdowns. He also scored on a 92-yard kick-off return in 
the Falcons' 34-23 victory over Bellflower Friday at Santa Ana Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just the coaches. We have a lot of hurt feelings after last week." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ed Riley, Tustin assistant coach when asked before the game if there were 
any key injuries. The Tillers lost to cross-town rival Foothill last Friday, 
40-6. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried not to think about it, but it really hurts," 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rik Glover, a Santa Margarita defensive end who played Friday after nearly 
slicing off two fingers during sculpture class the day before. The 6-0, 
190-pound senior needed six stitches to close the wound that severed the 
tendons and nerves. Friday's Best

SYLMAR PUNISHES CHATSWORTH WITH DOMINANT PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT PURDUE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After being placed on two years' probation Wednesday by the City Section for 
holding an illegal practice, the Sylmar High football team showed no ill 
effects Friday night. The Spartans crushed Chatsworth, 47-7, in a City Section 
nonconference game at Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids were actually relieved and we were happy the kids weren't punished," 
Sylmar coach Jeff Engilman said. "It's been kind of a dramatic week." 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar (2-0) took all the drama out of the game early by moving to a 20-7 lead 
behind the play of senior wide receiver Devon Young, who caught three passes 
for 87 yards and two touchdowns and rushed for another score. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar's Durell Price carried 13 times for 135 yards and a touchdown. 
Quarterback Greg Marquez completed 9 of 13 passes for 181 yards and three 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Marquez and Young connected on a six-yard scoring play that capped Sylmar's 
opening drive. Chatsworth came right back, however, as running back Antwon 
Nelson broke free on a 60-yard touchdown run. Nelson gained 95 yards in seven 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar dominated the rest of the game. Young scored on a five-yard end-around, 
then hooked up with Marquez on a 67-yard touchdown pass play for a 20-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth quarterback David Hummell, who completed one of 11 passes in the 
first half, fell on an errant snap in his own end zone for a safety. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, the Spartans scored on a 57-yard run by Price, a 
three-yard rush by Lorenzo Garcia and a 70-yard interception return by Eddie 
Lopez.

CHAMINADE ENFORCES ZERO TOLERANCE AGAIN, 28-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dominating defense did it again for Chaminade High. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second consecutive week, the Eagles held an opponent scoreless, 
overwhelming El Camino Real in a 28-0 nonleague game Friday night at Chaminade. 
</P>
<P>
 Spearheading a savage pass rush that recorded five sacks was senior linebacker 
Dino Dinielli, who spent the better part of the evening in the Conquistadore 
backfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinielli sacked quarterback Shaun Fishman three times, chasing the harried 
sophomore each time before dragging him to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinielli also recovered the loose ball after Jon Green blocked a punt at the 
El Camino Real 31-yard line midway through the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Funnest game I've had in a while," Dinielli said. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, Chaminade, which defeated Agoura, 21-0, in its opener, held El 
Camino Real to 11 yards passing and minus-19 yards rushing and intercepted one 
pass. Sacks accounted for minus-50 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conquistadores made only two first downs, both on Chaminade penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's two weeks of just excellent performance by the defense," Chaminade 
Coach Rich Lawson said. "This is one of the best tackling teams I've had in 
seven years here." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dinielli: "Our defense is pretty unbelievable. We're gonna blitz and just 
keep on coming." 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles' running attack was dominating too. Junior tailback Jason 
Giovannettone rushed for 119 yards and two touchdowns in 19 carries. 
Giovannettone, who rushed for 85 yards last week, opened the scoring with a 
five-yard run with three minutes to play in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Giovannettone added an 11-yard touchdown early in the fourth quarter, three 
plays after running 25 yards to the El Camino Real 17. Giovannettone carried 
five times for 50 yards on the 65-yard drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Racius threw a three-yard touchdown pass to Gabe Crecion in the second 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the game, reserve running back Scot Davis ran three yards for a 
touchdown.

WESTLAKE PASSES BY VENTURA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LAZARUS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So much for Jim Benkert's master plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Westlake High coach planned to rotate three quarterbacks in Friday night's 
game against Ventura, just as he did in a lopsided season-opening victory over 
Buena. 
</P>
<P>
 But starting quarterback Scott Spruill's performance changed Benkert's mind 
midstream, as the Warriors rebounded from an early two-touchdown deficit to 
defeat Ventura, 52-26. 
</P>
<P>
 Spruill completed 13 of 24 passes for 289 yards and three second-quarter 
touchdowns as Westlake (2-0) amassed 540 yards of offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Spruill remained in the game until midway through the fourth quarter, when 
Brian Shubin replaced him. Shubin completed five of seven passes for 47 yards 
and a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We planned on switching earlier but I didn't want to disrupt the rhythm of 
our offense," Benkert said. "We still have two quality quarterbacks." 
</P>
<P>
 Spruill spread the wealth among Westlake receivers Billy Miller (six 
receptions, 103 yards), Jason Victor (five, 105) and Mike Leibin (five, 118). 
</P>
<P>
 "I just felt hot going in, even though we didn't score early," Spruill said. 
"Then we just started clicking." 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake's passing success opened up the running game. Backup tailback Jamal 
Harris gained 85 yards in six second-half carries, including a pair of 30-yard 
touchdown runs. Victor also gained 53 yards in six carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura (0-2), behind quarterback Erik Olson, was able to stay close to 
Westlake until the beginning of the fourth quarter. Olson scored a pair of 
touchdowns and completed nine of 14 passes for 82 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura's option attack worked perfectly in the Cougars' first two 
possessions. Tailback Aaron Davis rushed for 99 yards, including scoring runs 
of 24 and 20 yards in the first quarter. But Davis gained only eight more yards 
the rest of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Two turnovers stalled the Cougar offense in the second quarter as Westlake 
took the lead, but Olson scored on a nine-yard run late in the first half to 
put Ventura temporarily back on top. 
</P>
<P>
 After turnovers on Westlake's first two possessions in the opening quarter, 
Spruill exploded for 161 passing yards in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller caught three scoring passes, including a 35-yard bomb at the end of the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor scored on a two-yard run for the Warriors' first score and took a 
screen pass 47 yards to help Westlake take a 25-20 halftime advantage.

DUPETIT PLAYS FIELD, NOTRE DAME WINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was only one Dave Dupetit on the field Friday night at Notre Dame High. 
It just seemed like there were more. 
</P>
<P>
 Dupetit, a senior linebacker for Notre Dame, had five sacks and recovered a 
fumble, leading the Knights to a 21-3 nonleague victory over Royal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dave Dupetit was all over the field," Notre Dame Coach Kevin Rooney said. "It 
seemed like he was in on every tackle." 
</P>
<P>
 But he was only the statistical leader of a defensive group that controlled 
the game by holding Royal's Jerome Lee to 26 yards rushing and Mike Reddington 
to 24. Lee and Reddington rushed for more than 200 yards last week against 
Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played very good," Dupetit said. "We stopped the run. We knew that's what 
we had to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Royal Coach Gene Uebelhardt: "With the speed of their defense, they got 
to our running backs before they could get started." 
</P>
<P>
 Royal had only 27 net yards rushing and 116 passing, but most of those came 
when the Highlanders (1-1) went to a no-huddle offense in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal quarterback Wes Lagatta completed 17 of 27 passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame (2-0), top-ranked in Division III of the Southern Section, was not 
outstanding on offense, but it didn't have to be. 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback John Garcia led the team with 63 yards and a touchdown in 18 carries. 
Quarterback Ryan Bowne completed four of 12 passes for 22 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was apparent early that Notre Dame would not need much offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights held Royal to two first downs and 45 yards in seven first-half 
possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal's defense was nearly as good, giving up 59 yards in the first half, and 
only nine after Notre Dame took the ball 50 yards on its opening possession for 
a touchdown -- Bowne's 10-yard pass to Nick Kounalis. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference in the half was a special teams play: a 69-yard touchdown on a 
punt return by 5-foot-5 senior Corey Franzini in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal's only score came on a 37-yard field goal by Matt Pitstick as the gun 
sounded to end the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame put the game away when Garcia scored on a 21-yard run with 4 
minutes 28 seconds remaining in the third quarter.

<P>
 Gee, thanks. 
</P>
<P>
 So West Bakersfield High marched up and down the field as often as not. So the 
Vikings rolled up a respectable dose of yardage. So they pushed the Antelope 
Valley defense around several times. 
</P>
<P>
 So . . . what? 
</P>
<P>
 West couldn't protect the football, and basically handed Antelope Valley a 
14-0 victory in an intersectional game Friday night at Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 West (1-1) didn't have any trouble cranking up its offense, especially in the 
first half, but forked the ball over four times, including a game-deciding 
fumble at the Antelope Valley two-yard line with 2 minutes 41 seconds 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just didn't hold onto the ball," said Antelope Valley quarterback Trymon 
Redick, who also plays in the secondary. " Toooooo many turnovers." 
</P>
<P>
 With less than three minutes left, West drove to the Antelope Valley eight, 
but two running plays only moved the ball to the two. On third down, reserve 
running back Cory Oggs fumbled at the two and Redick recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 It marked the second consecutive shutout for Antelope Valley (2-0), which 
defeated Hesperia last week, 8-0. West outgained Antelope Valley, 225-201, but 
without the ball, it doesn't mean much. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might have been closer without the turnovers," said Antelope Valley 
running back Jermaine Lewis, who was held to 58 yards in 18 carries, but scored 
on a seven-yard run with 4:05 left in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 With Antelope Valley holding a two-touchdown lead in the final quarter, West 
mounted another scoring threat, but it ended when quarterback Kyle Ursery was 
sacked by a trio of players on fourth and 17 at the Antelopes' 32 with 10:09 
remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 With the defense making the fortuitous play, it didn't matter that Antelope 
Valley also was blanked in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley took a 14-0 lead with six seconds remaining in the first half 
when Ken Nelson scored on a one-yard run, and Redick ran a bootleg for the 
two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley sophomore Tony Walker had recovered a fumble at the West 41 
with 2:05 left. On the ensuing series, he turned a screen pass in a long gain 
gain that ended inside the one.

<P>
 Paced by two touchdowns from Edon Kagasoff and a strong defensive effort, 
Newport Harbor dominated visiting Ocean View, 28-0, in a nonleague game in 
front of 1,200 Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Kagasoff, who scored on runs of seven and 44 yards, led all rushers with 57 
yards in six carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensively, Bill Johns and Dan McDonough frustrated the Seahawks, extending 
the Golden West League team's losing streak to 31 games, currently the state's 
longest. 
</P>
<P>
 Johns finished the night with two sacks for Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a little sloppy at times," Sailor Coach Jeff Brinkley said. "We 
definitely weren't as crisp as last week." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors (2-0) took command early, driving 65 yards in 10 plays on its 
first possession, eventually scoring on a one-yard run by Brian Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View (0-2), which was held to only three total yards offense in the 
first half, opened the second half with its only substantial drive. The 
Seahawks used 16 plays to advance to the Sailor 32-yard line before Johnson 
intercepted a Ted Norman pass in the end zone to end the threat. MATT FARMER

 Trabuco Hills played the numbers game against Laguna Hills and won, 24-7, 
Friday night at Mission Viejo High. 
</P>
<P>
 Showing exceptional depth at the skilled positions, the fifth-ranked Mustangs 
rotated five running backs and completed passes to seven receivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Laguna Hills stayed with its one-dimensional offense, which 
sputtered in the first half and finally crashed in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 Brendan McGraw, who rushed for 277 yards and six touchdowns last week, 
produced 119 yards in 14 carries for the Hawks, but half of that came on his 
66-yard touchdown run in the second quarter that tied the score, 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills (2-0) then came back on its next drive and marched to the 
25-yard line, where Mike Junge kicked a 42-yard field goal with 5:07 left in 
the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The second half belonged to the Mustang defense, which held McGraw to 42 yards 
rushing and produced two interceptions by Jake Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trabuco Hills offense came up with its longest drive of the game late in 
the third quarter as quarterbacks J.C. Pintsak and Chad Collins combined on 
four consecutive completions to give the Mustangs first and goal at the 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Three plays later, Bobby Johnson capped the eight-play, 83-yard drive with a 
one-yard touchdown run and a 17-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's second interception was returned 45 yards to the Laguna Hills 
49-yard line and set up the Mustangs' final score. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Harper picked up 13 yards on a reception over the middle and Anderson 
then put the ball at the one with another pass from Pintsak. 
</P>
<P>
 De Sha Runnels then scored from a yard to give Trabuco Hills a 24-7 lead with 
2:53 left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Pintsak led the Mustang offense, competing 10 of 16 passes for 124 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 McGraw led the Laguna Hills receivers with 60 yards on four catches, including 
38 on the game's opening play.

FAIRPLEX; MALIBU LIGHT SURGES TO WIN FEATURE RACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jockey Danny Sorenson had a feeling things could break right for him in the 
$50,000 Las Ninas Stakes at Fairplex Park on Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 On a day front-runners were having trouble holding the lead, Sorenson had the 
mount on Malibu Light, a late-running filly, in a 6 1/2-furlong race that 
featured front-runners Persistant Sal and Klassy Kim. 
</P>
<P>
 Persistant Sal, in particular, had been a standout in two previous races. She 
was unbeaten and had earned a 104 Beyer speed rating with her maiden victory on 
June 18 at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday, Klassy Kim went out with Persistant Sal and they set fractions of 
21 1/5 and 44 4/5, which set up perfectly for Malibu Light. 
</P>
<P>
 Malibu Light, along with Gambling Mistress, made a move at the top of the 
stretch and both horses passed the early leaders to finish 1-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Malibu Light, the winner by a length, was timed in 1:17 3/5 and paid 11.40. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I read the paper, the race set up well for us," Sorenson said. "When I 
talked it over with (trainer) George (Vogel), he told me the same thing. She 
ran hard and deserved to win." 
</P>
<P>
 Vogel said he has no plans for Malibu Light. "I think we'll just take the 
money and run," he said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Fernando Valenzuela rode four winners, highlighted by his victory aboard 
Luxury Box in the $50,000 Beau Brummel Stakes for 2-year-old colts and geldings 
in the 10th race. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third victory in four starts for Luxury Box, who is owned by Dan J. 
Agnew and trained by Jerry Fanning. 
</P>
<P>
 Breaking from the No. 5 post in the six-horse field, Valenzuela sent Luxury 
Box to the lead and never relinquished it. Cold N Calculating, the even-money 
favorite ridden by Pat Valenzuela, chased the winner home but came up a length 
short. The winner covered the 6 1/2 furlongs in 1:17 4/5 and paid $5.80. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was impressed by this colt," Valenzuela said. "I was lucky to get an easy 
lead and slow it down. When I chirped to him, he had another gear, actually, a 
couple of gears left. He rides the bullring like he's a bullring horse." 
</P>
<P>
 Luxury Box's next start will probably be on closing day, Oct. 3, in the 
Breeders' Cup Stakes, according to Fanning. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela's other winners came on Broken Melody ($11.80) in the sixth, Sea Of 
Serenity ($4.00) in the seventh and Flying Safeera ($9.80) in the ninth. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The $500,000 Woodward Stakes at Belmont Park in New York will be simulcast at 
Fairplex today. The scheduled post time is 1:41 p.m., about 20 minutes before 
the first live race. . . . Fernando Valenzuela, who rode 5-1 shot Rotsaluck to 
victory in the Foothill Stakes on opening day, was spotted after that race with 
a mutuel ticket of an undetermined amount cupped in his right hand. When asked 
what he was clutching, Valenzuela replied, "Dinner money." 
</P>
<P>
 Milady's Knight, who went off at 69-1 in the 13th race, rewarded those who 
stayed to the end to bet on him with a $140.40 payoff. His photo-finish victory 
over Fortunate Answer in the six-furlong race keyed a triple that paid 
$2,130.90 and a trifecta that paid $16,149.

CRESPI SPUTTERS AGAINST CANYON SPRINGS 
</P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There were no come-from-behind heroics for Crespi High this week. 
</P>
<P>
 It started badly -- and stayed that way for 48 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Crespi managed just three first downs in the first half and never got on 
track, suffering a 38-15 setback to Canyon Springs in a nonleague game Friday 
at Valley View High. 
</P>
<P>
 Canyon Springs (1-1), ranked No. 20 in the state by Cal-Hi Sports, amassed 248 
yards in the first half to fuel a 20-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Crespi (1-1), which overcame a 13-point deficit in the second half 
to beat Taft, 20-19, last week, sputtered throughout. 
</P>
<P>
 Terrelle Smith rushed for 87 yards and two touchdowns for Canyon Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing, 20-0, late in the first half, Crespi appeared to turn its fortunes 
around when Mark Stipkovich recovered a fumble and returned it 80 yards for a 
touchdown.

 Jeremy Mushinski had 86 yards in 14 carries and scored the first four 
touchdowns to lead Saugus to a 41-0 victory over Palmdale Friday night at 
Palmdale High. 
</P>
<P>
 Mushinski, a senior tailback, scored on runs of two, one, two and one yards to 
give Saugus (2-0) a 26-0 lead midway through the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Matt Gillis had six sacks and led a stellar performance by the 
Centurian defense, which forced five fumbles and recovered four. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Oh no, not No. 89 again,' that quarterback must have been saying," Saugus 
Coach Jack Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus quarterback Kevin Carrasco completed four of 10 passes for 101 yards. 
He had two passes intercepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale's Gerald Brown intercepted a pass by Carrasco at the Saugus 30-yard 
line and returned it 22 yards, but the first Falcon fumble ended the scoring 
threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale quarterback Phillip Paez completed two of six passes for 12 yards in 
the first quarter, but was replaced by Johnny Gillespie in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Gillespie completed five of 11 passes for 34 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The lone offensive bright spot for the Falcons (0-2) came on a 25-yard run by 
Janel White in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Palmdale is a young team and Coach (Jeff) Williams plays tough teams in the 
preseason," Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our kids on defense wanted to do something special." 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Olivares was Palmdale's leading rusher with 30 yards in nine carries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons had nine penalties for 75 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus had nine penalties for 80 yards. 
</P>

 In the first half, Saugus held Palmdale to only 15 yards. Saugus gained 130 
yards in the first half.

 Running back Darren Maxwell rushed for 191 yards in 33 carries and scored two 
touchdowns to lead St. Francis High to a 28-7 victory over Verdugo Hills in a 
nonleague football game Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxwell caught an 11-yard scoring pass from Brian Rucker in the first quarter 
and ran two yards for another touchdown in the third quarter.Maxwell had two 
receptions for 22 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Rucker, who led St. Francis on scoring drives of 66 and 79 yards, left the 
game because of a lower back injury after connecting with tight end Chris Ross 
on a two-point conversion following the Golden Knights' second score. 
</P>
<P>
 Rucker completed four of seven passes for 78 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 In Rucker's place, reserve quarterback John Carnevali guided St. Francis 
(1-0-1) on two fourth-quarter scoring drives. 
</P>

 Carnevali threw touchdown passes of seven yards to Andrew Warnock (two 
receptions, 33 yards) and nine yards to Vince Dioguardi.

SIMI VALLEY NIPS GRANADA HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A pair of third-quarter touchdowns by Simi Valley stood up when Granada Hills 
kicker Jordan De Jong missed a 23-yard field-goal attempt late in the game, 
allowing the Pioneers to escape with a 14-13 win on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Brian MacLean helped move Granada Hills into position for the 
kick, completing four passes as the Highlanders drove from their 46 to the Simi 
Valley 18.Running back Eric Richardson then carried twice to the six, where 
Granada Hills chose to kick. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately for the Highlanders, De Jong's attempt was low and wide right, 
giving Simi Valley possession. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Pioneers still weren't safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley running back Chris Miller fumbled three plays later at his 27, 
giving Granada Hills another opportunity. However, the Highlanders moved 
backward to their 44 and didn't threaten. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley's Anthony Tauriello intercepted as fourth-down desperation pass by 
MacLean to seal the Pioneers' victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Granada Hills led, 13-0, in the second half before the Pioneers (2-0) made 
their move. 
</P>
<P>
 J.J. Washington closed the margin to 13-7 when he caught a 14-yard pass from 
quarterback Tim Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
 Three plays later, Brian Kavanaugh stepped in front of a MacLean pass and 
returned it 34 yards for the winning touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Afri Walker scored on a 34-yard pass from MacLean in the first quarter for a 
7-0 edge.

CITY SECTION FOOTBALL ROUNDUP; SMITH GAINS 215 YARDS TO LEAD SLOPPY KENNEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BRESNAHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It can't be said that Kennedy High performed masterfully, or played 
brilliantly, in its 36-15 nonleague football victory over Inglewood at home 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The above, however, can be said for Kennedy running back Antwane Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith rushed for 215 yards in 19 carries and scored three touchdowns, 
overcoming an otherwise sloppy display by the Golden Cougars, who finished with 
205 yards in penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Add three fumbles to that, and it's easy to see why Kennedy Coach Bob Francola 
promised plenty of wind sprints at Monday's practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Smith did have one fumble -- his only miscue of the evening -- he 
should probably be granted a pardon come Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith began his rampage early in the second quarter, galloping 21 yards for a 
touchdown that tied the score, 7-7. On Kennedy's next possession, Smith 
received a 48-yard scoring pass from Dan McMullen to put the Golden Cougars 
ahead, 14-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's numbers in the first half -- 11 carries, 124 yards, two touchdowns -- 
were nice, but the same couldn't be said for his team's overall first half 
performance, which included 13 penalties for 115 yards and three fumbles. Small 
wonder why the Cougars, despite dominating the line of scrim, led by only seven 
at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's first carry of the second half led to his third touchdown, a 12-yard 
run up the middle for a 21-7 Kennedy lead. The score came two plays after 
Kennedy blocked its second punt of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Smith didn't score Kennedy's fourth touchdown -- that was left for 
McMullen and Damion Thompson, who connected for a seven-yard score -- he set it 
up with a 50-yard kickoff return and a 29-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 McMullen completed 12 of 17 passes for 121 yards with three touchdown passes.

ORANGE COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PREP EXTRA; FAUSTO RUNS FREE, SCORING FIVE 
TIMES FOR LOS AMIGOS 
</P>

<P>
 Los Amigos running back Greg Fausto put on a ballcarriers' clinic Friday 
night, rushing for five touchdowns and 275 yards to lead the Lobos to a 38-21 
victory at Garden Grove High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tustin defenders looked bewildered as Fausto scored four times in the 
first half on runs of 29, 10, 7 and 86 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the game Los Amigos Coach Roger Takahashi said he wasn't going to 
change anything after his team's season-opening 20-7 victory over Century last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to score more points this week," Takahashi said. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Lobos did. Thanks to Fausto and a defense that recorded 10 sacks. 
Jacob Sanchez had four sacks and Jose Medina had three. 
</P>
<P>
 The seventh-ranked Lobos got a fumble recovery by Sanchez on the second play 
of the game and two plays later, Fausto carried the ball in. Barely a minute 
had ticked off the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Four downs later, the Tillers punted the ball. Fausto soon again crossing the 
goal line, this time from 10 yards out, and it was 13-0 with 6 minutes 50 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Fausto scored once more before Tustin was finally able to put points on the 
board. Senior Reggie Curry took a short pass 30 yards to cut the Lobos' lead to 
19-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Fausto came back one more time, on second and 21, when he ran through the 
Tillers' line and sprinted 86 yards for his fourth touchdown and 25-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Amigos' other first-half score came when La Rue Carr caught a 65-yard pass 
from Ape Tuato with 36 seconds remaining and Los Amigos led, 31-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Fausto scored one more time on a 70-yard run to close out the third quarter 
and take a 38-7 lead. He would have scored a record-tying six times on the 
night, but a holding penalty nullified a three-yard touchdown run in the fourth 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tillers' Brandon Lambert finished with two touchdowns, scoring in the last 
two minutes on runs of 11 and 17 yards.

<P>
 Villa Park snapped out of its offensive funk and sent Brea-Olinda into one 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans scored 14 first-quarter points and held Brea to two first downs 
in the first half on their way to a 28-7 nonleague victory at Brea-Olinda High 
School. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park (1-0-1), which struggled in a 0-0 tie against Valencia last week, 
utilized the Sean McMahon-to-Sean Adams connection to build its early lead. On 
the Spartans' second possession, McMahon hit Adams three times for 47 yards, 
including a 32-yard completion on third and 16 from the Spartan 31. The two 
combined for a four-yard touchdown pass to finish the drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans recovered a fumble by Brea's Ryan Jones on the ensuing kickoff. 
Seven plays later, McMahon rolled out and hit running back Tony D'Amato with a 
seven-yard touchdown pass and a 14-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last week we failed a couple of times on scoring opportunities, but this week 
we made it count," said McMahon, who completed 14 of 17 passes for 197 yards 
and three touchdowns. "I think we executed better. We wanted to establish 
certain things from the very start." 
</P>
<P>
 Adams caught seven passes for 106 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Villa Park scored again on its first possession of the second half. On its 
first play, McMahon hit Kris Fisher with a 32-yard completion to the Brea 49. 
Five plays later, Franklin Haynes broke a couple of tackles and scored on a 
25-yard run. McMahon passed to Matt Welch for a two-point conversion and a 22-0 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Haynes led the Spartans with 80 yards in 11 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea scored its only touchdown late in the third quarter, on Jerome Owens' 
six-yard touchdown run. Owens led the Wildcats with 81 yards in 18 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Spartans capped the scoring on a McMahon-to-Rob Hartzell 14-yard pass with 
8 minutes 33 seconds left in the game.

ORANGE COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PREP EXTRA; EL TORO BLITZ SHUTS DOWN DANA 
HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 El Toro used a simple recipe in Friday night's 10-0 victory over Dana Hills -- 
solid defense mixed with a balanced offense and, when in doubt, add a little 
Mo.  
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers (1-1) defense, using a variety of blitzes, held Dana Hills to 66 
yards total offense, most of those coming late in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt we could match up well with them and play man-to-man, which would 
allow us to blitz more," El Toro Coach Mike Milner said. 
</P>
<P>
 And his idea worked well, as the Chargers had four sacks and forced Dana Hills 
quarterback Scott Maynard to scramble several other times to avoid more sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro used a ground-control offense that moved the ball but never reached 
the end zone until Mo Sango became part of the mix. Sango touched the ball 
three times on a four-play drive, including a 43-yard touchdown catch of a 
Brian Wilson pass. Sango's spin move at the 25 left Dolphin players grasping at 
air as he raced into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mo is a multi-dimensional player," Milner said. "We added a couple things 
this week to try to get the ball in his hands a little more, and we hoped it 
would pay off.' 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro opened the scoring on their first possession when they marched 53 
yards on seven plays and scored when Chad Johnson kicked a 23-yard field goal 
to put the Chargers up, 3-0. JOE WOJCIECHOWSKI

ORANGE COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PREP EXTRA; SANTA MARGARITA STRUGGLES AGAIN 
WITHOUT QUARTERBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Quarterback Chris Collins' return to the Santa Margarita lineup can't come 
soon enough for the Eagles. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second consecutive week, the offense failed to score a touchdown. 
Santa Margarita was held to 17 yards in 14 plays in the second half during a 
21-0 loss to Glendora Friday in front of 2,500 at Saddleback College. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins, a 6-2 junior, said before the game that he'll likely be out another 
two or three weeks because of the knee injury he suffered before the 
season-opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Coach Jim Hartigan doesn't sound too optimistic about the prospects for 
the Eagles (0-2), even after Collins returns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're (in a) deadlock offensively but we still have a lot of problems besides 
the quarterback," he said. "We didn't eliminate our mistakes from last week, 
and it's not just one person either. I can't pinpoint it. It's everyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Glendora (1-1) controlled the game from the beginning, and two trick plays by 
its two star players in the first half put them ahead, 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The first came on the Tartans second possession when halfback Mathis Ward 
completed an eight-play drive by throwing a 22-yard touchdown pass to wide open 
Ben Russell. Then, with 6 minutes 37 seconds remaining in the second quarter, 
Ward took the handoff and handed it back to Russell on the end-around. Russell 
wasn't untouched on his 58-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendora scored to open the second half. Quarterback Jon Smith completed three 
passes for 58 yards, the final one a six-yard touchdown to Andrew Kassotis. 
Cory Amos' third point-after kick made it 21-0. Santa Margarita's defense 
played well but was on the field too long. Tartans finished with 275 yards 
total offense. The Eagles had 116. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's real discouraging because I thought our defense was real good," Eagle 
defensive end Rik Glover said. "We got hurt by those two plays and they got 
real tired at the end." MICHAEL CASEY

 Oak Park 37, Calabasas 13-Quarterback Ron Allen's 22-yard pass to Eric Ruhle 
early in the second quarter began the scoring and triggered host Oak Park's 
rout. 
</P>
<P>
 The scoring pass followed a blocked punt by defensive end Mike Waters deep in 
Coyote territory.From then on it was all Oak Park (2-0). 
</P>
<P>
 Oak Park continually shut down the Calabasas running attack forcing the 
Coyotes to put the ball in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 That led to interceptions by defensive backs Billy Mitchell and Tyler Blondi, 
the latter of whom returned it 44 yards to the Calabasas one-yard line in the 
second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Eagle running back Ryan Johnson led all rushers with 69 in nine carries. Allen 
completed eight of 16 for 98 yards and two touchdowns. JASON SANDS

zone for a safety. 
</P>

of 12 for 19 yards with two interceptions. The second interception was returned 
20 yards by linebacker Val Orozco to wrap up the scoring.

one-yard sneak in the second half. DAVID GRIMM

 Valencia took advantage of six Servite turnovers en route to a 27-13 victory 
Friday night at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers, ranked No. 9 in the county, forced four fumbles and intercepted 
two passes by Friar quarterback David Martin to help put the game out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
 After Servite's first possession ended in a fumble, Valencia (1-1) scored for 
the first time this season on a three-yard run by Damian Askins for a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Servite (0-2) cut into the lead when running back Marvin Smith scored on a 
three-yard run with 7:30 left in the second quarter. The score capped a 
16-play, 73-yard drive, but the missed extra point left the Friars with a 7-6 
deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Servite's next possession ended when Frank Patti fumbled on the Friar 18-yard 
line. Valencia added to its lead five plays later when quarterback Joe Secoda 
hit Jermaine Gray with a seven-yard touchdown pass. Valencia took a 13-7 lead 
into halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 Friar running back David Bedard fumbled on Servite's first play of the second 
half, and seven plays later, Secoda connected with Gray on another seven-yard 
strike, increasing the Tigers' lead to 20-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray then intercepted Martin's pass on Servite's next drive and, two plays 
later, Arron Carbajal ran 85 yards for a touchdown with 2:28 left in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Servite's final score came when Martin hit Mike Garko for a 21-yard touchdown 
pass with 41 seconds left in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Carbajal finished with 113 yards in 13 carries and Askins added 69 yards in 
eight carries for the Tigers.

CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE CROSS-COUNTRY PREVIEW; WOMEN MAY BE IN RUNNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A chance to compete in a conference meet for the first time in five years and 
the fact that this could be his strongest women's team since 1990 has Cal State 
Northridge cross-country Coach Don Strametz looking forward to the upcoming 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors, who run in the UC Irvine Invitational today, have competed as an 
independent since moving to the NCAA Division I level in 1990, but they'll in 
the American West Conference this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The conference, which includes Northridge, Cal State Sacramento, Cal Poly San 
Luis Obispo and Southern Utah, is on the small side, but Strametz figures that 
membership in a conference of any size beats the alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that we're in a conference will be a definite plus," he said. "I 
know that everyone is already talking about running in the conference meet on 
Oct. 29." 
</P>
<P>
 The American West championships in San Luis Obispo will precede the District 
VIII meet in Tucson on Nov. 12. The top two teams and the top three individuals 
among the top 15 finishers but not on a qualifying team will advance to the 
NCAA championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Strametz will consider the season a success if the Matador women can finish 
among the top 10 teams in the District VIII meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can crack into the top 10, that would be a definite breakthrough for 
us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Lori Miller and freshman Jamie Whitmore are expected to be Northridge's 
top runners. They'll be followed by seniors Jennifer Andrews, Cheri-Lee Segal 
and Karla Sanford, and freshmen Eman Barfield and Andrea Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrews was Northridge's highest finisher at last year's regional -- placing 
55th -- but Strametz says she could finish much higher this year. 
</P>
<P>
 range between third and seventh on this year's team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lori and Jamie have established themselves as No. 1 and No. 2 in workouts, 
but we've got four or five others who can run between (third and seventh)," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time Northridge had any depth to speak of was in 1989, when 
individual champion Darcy Arreola led the Matadors to a fourth-place finish in 
the Division II finals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have someone like Darcy on this team," Strametz said. "But I think 
this group will be more tightly bunched." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Brian Godsey, who redshirted last year; sophomore Armando Lerma, 89th 
in the District VIII meet; and junior Dave Hensley, a transfer from Antelope 
Valley College, are expected to be the Matadors' top runners. Middle-distance 
runners Jeff Nasternak and Warren Reich fill the fourth and fifth positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Nasternak has run 1:51.8 for 800 meters and Reich made tremendous strides over 
the summer, according to Strametz, but how well they'll perform in 
cross-country races measuring five miles or 10,000 meters remains to be seen.

 Century High quarterback Stanley Villanueva completed nine of 10 passes for 
184 yards and three touchdowns Friday night to pace the Centurions to a 33-7 
victory over John Glenn at La Mirada High. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-10, 185-pound senior hit his first five passes before throwing an 
incompletion, but Century didn't miss much after that.The Centurions scored on 
their first two possessions of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Beau Wallace, who finished with 55 yards in eight carries, scored on a 
nine-yard run. Villanueva then hit Jorge Rodriguez with a 24-yard touchdown

</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez recovered a fumble with 4:55 left in the second quarter, and, on the 
first play after the turnover, Villanueva passed 29 yards to Rolando Cortez for 
a touchdown. Cortez also caught a 35-yard touchdown pass in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Wallace scored from seven yards out with 1:19 left in the first half for a 
27-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn didn't get its first first down until the 6:05 mark of the second 
quarter. And the Eagles didn't complete their first pass until midway through 
the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez led Century in receiving with three catches for 62 yards and a 
touchdown. Jose Caravez finished with 47 yards in nine carries for the 
Centurions. RUSSELL BANKS

 Senior Lymar Pratt rushed for two second-half touchdowns to lead Long Beach 
Millikan to a 25-24 victory over Santa Ana Friday night at Long Beach Millikan.

 Santa Ana quarterback Brian Schwalm drove the Saints to the Rams' 44 yard-line 
after a 19-yard screen pass to Francisco Franco. On fourth and two, however,

 Sophomore running back Omar Gomez sparked a spirited Saints' rushing attack 
with a team-high 89 yards. Schwalm rushed for 84 yards as Santa Ana gained 211 
yards on the ground.

 El Modena running back Jason Said scored on a five-yard run late in the fourth 
quarter to give the Vanguards a 10-7 victory over Sunny Hills in a nonleague 
game Friday at Buena Park High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd of 1,800 saw the lethargic Vanguard offense come to life in the 
second half and steal a victory from the Lancers. 
</P>
<P>
 Said's touchdown run came with 2 minutes 16 seconds left and capped nine-play, 
53-yard drive. The key play of the drive came on a fourth and one at the Sunny 
Hills 7. Quarterback Chris Goodwin powered up the middle on a keeper for a 
first down at the five. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hills quarterback Greg Garand tried to rally his team into field-goal 
range, but El Modena's defense held tough. On fourth down and 10 at the Sunny 
Hills 35, El Modena defensive back Brent Galasso hit wide receiver Eric 
Hernandez, causing the pass to fall incomplete. El Modena took over on downs 
and ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hills tight end Sean Garanillo scored the first touchdown of the game on 
a 13-yard pass from Garand with 3:52 left in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 El Modena's defense held Sunny Hills in check for the entire second half. One 
of the key plays came when defensive back Greg Hanson intercepted a pass at the 
Sunny Hills 45 yard-line. The play ended the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 El Modena scored its first points on a 42-yard field goal by Edward Romo with 
4:24 left in the third quarter. The play ended a 10-play drive, 40-yard drive.

<P>
 No longer the quarterback du jour for the Detroit Lions, Erik Kramer is 
enjoying the stability of life with the Chicago Bears. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes all the difference in the world," said Kramer, who makes his third 
start for the Bears Sunday against the Minnesota Vikings at Soldier Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer shared the starting job with Rodney Peete and Andre Ware during his 
three seasons with the Lions. It was not a good situation for any of them and 
none were able to hold on to the job. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been an uphill battle for Kramer, who played quarterback at Burroughs 
High, Pierce College and North Carolina State before being drafted by the 
Lions. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he led the Lions to the NFC championship game in 1991 when Peete was 
injured, Kramer was on the bench again the following season and never was able 
to wrest the starting job away from the former USC quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Signed as a free agent by the Bears this year, Kramer is getting his chance to 
prove he's a first-team player, but he doesn't feel any extra pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "The expectations I put on myself are the same," he said. "I'm not concerned 
with what other people think." 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer got off to a good start, leading the Bears to a 21-9 victory over the 
Tampa Bay Buccaneers in the opening game. 
</P>
<P>
 He completed 18 of 25 passes for 212 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the Bears fell behind, 30-0, to the Philadelphia Eagles on Monday 
night, but Kramer threw three touchdown passes in the fourth quarter before the 
comeback fell short, 30-22. 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer completed 18 of 31 for 289 yards against the Eagles and ranks second in 
the NFC quarterback ratings with a mark of 115.3. 
</P>
<P>
 During the comeback in Philadelphia, he connected with Curtis Conway on 
touchdown pass plays of 22 and 85 yards in addition to hitting Conway for a 
two-point conversion before throwing a 16-yard scoring pass to tight end Marv 
Cook with 3 minutes 19 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 However, quarterback Randall Cunningham and the Eagles ran out the clock, 
denying Kramer and the Bears an opportunity to finish off the comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know my job is to prepare and come in and play consistently," Kramer said. 
"I can focus on that, instead of the other things that can happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears utilized short passes against the Buccaneers, but after being 
stifled early, Kramer stretched the Eagles' defense in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes they come out on first down and throw it and get about four or five 
yards," Eagle linebacker William Thomas said.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's like a good run. That's how they completed 78% of their passes 
(against Tampa Bay)." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bears will have to improve a running game that mustered only 66 yards in 
25 carries against Tampa Bay and was limited to 37 yards in 11 rushes against 
Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to take pride in our running game," Kramer said. "We definitely want 
to do a better job of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Kramer's passing could open the gates for the running game. In two games, he 
has thrown five touchdown passes.  
</P>
<P>
 Jim Harbaugh, starting quarterback for the Bears last year, threw only seven 
touchdown passes all season.

ORANGE COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PREP EXTRA; COSTA MESA ROLLS PAST 
WESTMINSTER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Costa Mesa piled up 495 yards on the ground and controlled the ball for more 
than 31 minutes, scoring on four of their first five possessions in beating 
Westminster, 38-14 Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Chatman led the Mustang attack with 226 yards on 19 carries and three 
touchdowns.Dewayne Crenshaw added 117 yards, all in the first half for the 
Mustangs (2-0). Crenshaw, who is recovering from a fractured wrist, piled up 
248 yards in last week's 50-6 victory over Ocean View. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatman scored on runs of 7, 49, and 22 yards on the first three Mustang 
possessions of the game to build a 22-0 lead. Westminster nearly got back a 
touchdown before the intermission, but Todd Mann dropped a Jerry Allison pass 
at the goal line and the Lions eventually turned the ball over on downs. 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Mesa added another score early in the third quarter, as Chatman runs of 
24 and 30 led to Brian Reeves' 7-yard scoring dash. 
</P>
<P>
 Westminster did not go quietly. Leonard Ibarra returned the ensuing kickoff 73 
yards to get the Lions on the board, and a 74-yard Allison-to-David Kurien pass 
set up an 18-yard touchdown run from Allison. 
</P>
<P>
 After the teams exchanged fumbles, Costa Mesa added another touchdown, this 
one on a 27-yard pass from Ryan Taylor to Josh Amezola, to take a 38-14 lead 
and put the contest out of reach. ERIC MADDY

<P>
 Sparked by a 254-yard performance by senior Chris Young, Rancho Alamitos 
defeated Aliso Niguel, 36-12, at Bolsa Grande Stadium in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Allen scored three times on runs of three, two, and 12 yards out and 
caught a 27-yard touchdown toss from John Frank. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Alamitos grabbed a 6-0 lead 1 minute 48 seconds into the second quarter 
on a three-yard run by Allen. The scoring drive took 2:50 and was aided by 
five-yard face mask and illegal participation penalties against Aliso Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 Aliso Niguel answered on a Scott Nemeth-to-Deangelo Gossett 44-yard completion 
with 1:26 left in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 With one second left in the half, Rancho Alamitos took a 15-6 lead on a 
27-yard pass from Frank to Allen and the two-point conversion pass from Aaron 
Trigg to Jeff Turbarg. Allen also caught a pass for 39 yards on the drive. The 
drive took eight seconds and two plays and began with Tom Navarro's 
interception of Nemeth. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Alamitos' offense dominated the second half scoring three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The only other Aliso Niguel score came on a six-yard Nemeth throw to Joe 
Valenti. CATHY LALKO

<TEXT>
<P>
 Daven King rushed for 157 yards and three touchdowns and quarterback Jeremy 
Klemp had a near-flawless performance to lead Savanna to a 42-6 victory over 
Katella Friday at Glover Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Savanna used a variety of run-and-shoot plays that kept the Knights guessing 
throughout.When King wasn't exhausting Katella's defense with his elusive 
speed, Klemp was completing all but one of his passes. He finished with 12 
completions in 13 attempts for 157 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rebels scored on their first possession when King, who rushed only 10 
times in the game, raced up the middle for a 23-yard touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the second quarter, leading 7-0, Savanna drove to the Katella 
five-yard line on a 29-yard run by King. Four consecutive running plays failed 
to reach the end zone. Katella took over but was forced to punt from its three. 
King returned the punt 28 yards and set up a sneak by Klemp. 
</P>
<P>
 After Savanna defensive back Dedrick Ennis intercepted a pass late in the 
half, the Rebels scored when Klemp hit Berry Micheel on a nine-yard scoring 
pass. COREY LYONS

ORANGE COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PREP EXTRA; YOUNG, CALIFORNIA'S MISTAKES 
LEAD FULLERTON VICTORY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 There were two keys to Fullerton's 14-13 victory over California High School 
in nonleague action Friday night at California High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indian defense, which held the Condors to 160 total yards, and Christopher 
Young, who ran for 167 yards and two touchdowns to pace Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 If that weren't enough, California (0-2) also missed an extra point and two 
field goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Young opened the game with an 85-yard touchdown run on Fullerton's first play 
from scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Condors were able to drive down the field on their next possession thanks 
to two 15-yard penalties and four consecutive completions by quarterback David 
Baruch, who found Josh Walker from 13 yards out to tie the score, 7-7. 
</P>
<P>
 California had a chance to increase its lead late in the quarter but Hector 
Ramos missed a 30-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Two second-quarter fumbles proved costly for the Indians. The first came on 
California's 13-yard line and ended a scoring threat. 
</P>
<P>
 With 16 seconds left in the first half, Fullerton (1-1) fumbled on fourth down 
and Ron Rubio returned the ball 67 yards to give the Condors a 13-7 halftime 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third quarter, Young returned a punt 38 yards and later scored on a 
12-yard touchdown run with 7:07 left in the quarter to give the Indians a 14-13 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Condors had an opportunity to take the lead midway through the fourth 
quarter, but Ramos missed another 30-yard field goal. JASON HILL

ORANGE COUNTY HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PREP EXTRA; PONCHAK BAILS OUT THE BARONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Ponchak, ace relief pitcher on the Fountain Valley baseball team, is 
still getting used to his new starting role -- for the Baron football team. 
</P>
<P>
 But as you might expect from someone who is accustomed to bailing out his 
team, Ponchak came through late Friday, leading Fountain Valley to a 14-13 
victory over Lakewood in a nonleague game at Huntington Beach High. 
</P>
<P>
 Ponchak, a senior who was the Barons' starting quarterback as a sophomore but 
took last season off, looked rusty for much of Friday's game. He misfired on 
his first 10 passes and later had a streak of eight incomplete passes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's his first year back playing football," Fountain Valley Coach George Berg 
said. "He's just learning some things." 
</P>
<P>
 However, he was effective when the Barons (1-1) needed it, completing two 
touchdown passes to Michael Rumford on long-yardage, late-down situations. 
</P>
<P>
 The second touchdown pass, 18-yards to Rumford, came on third-and-13 with 9 
minutes 4 seconds left in the fourth quarter. The extra-point kick gave 
Fountain Valley a 14-13 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 On its next possession, Lakewood (0-2) drove into Baron territory but was hit 
by an unsportsmanlike penalty that killed the drive. After a punt, Fountain 
Valley ran out the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Ponchak's first touchdown came late in the first half when Ponchak maneuvered 
out of a third-and-32. He completed a 20-yard pass to Rumford, setting up 
fourth-and-12 at the 16. On the next play, Ponchak hit Rumford with a perfectly 
placed pass on a post pattern over the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 The touchdown tied the score, 7-7, with 2:23 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Ponchak completed eight of 28 passes with no interceptions. Rumford caught 
four passes for 80 yards.

 Laguna Beach won its first game of the season, beating determined El Segundo, 
7-0, in front more than 850 Friday night at Laguna Beach High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The Artists scored on a three-play drive in the waning moments of the first 
half.Quarterback Nate Tivaroff completed a 16-yard pass to wide receiver Zeda 
Stone, who streaked into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The Artists' defense recovered three costly fumbles, two in third quarter. 
Laguna Beach failed to score afterward, but kept the ball from quarterback Jack 
Hawley's Eagle offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagle receivers dropped many sure catches.  
</P>
<P>
 A dropped pass occurred in the end zone in the fourth quarter, when an Eagle 
score would have given them the opportunity to tie the score.  
</P>
<P>
 The Artists' defense was tested in the latter moments of the fourth quarter, 
when Hawley completed three passes of 25, 18 and 14 yards. With seconds ticking 
away, and no timeouts left, Hawley scrambled but was stopped at the Artists' 
four-yard line. An incomplete pass ended the threat. RICHARD MELKONIAN

 Sonora High went to its ground game to grind out a 35-6 victory over Santiago 
Friday night at La Habra High School. Three Sonora running backs combined to 
gain 196 yards, including 96 from Shawn Brass. 
</P>
<P>
 Brass, who sat out last week with an ankle injury, scored on a 51-yard run in 
the third quarter that gave the Raiders (1-1) a 28-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Kevin Rodriguez passed for 140 yards as Sonora took as 13-0 lead 
in the first quarter. Rodriguez threw a two-yard touchdown pass to Albert Lopez 
in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonora got a break in the first quarter when a 60-yard pass play was nullified 
by a penalty. The Cavaliers (0-2) did not realize that the illegal forward pass 
infraction included a loss of down and turned the ball over after a fourth-down 
running play. 
</P>
<P>
 Sam Escobar scored two plays later on 15-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Raiders' next possession, Rodriguez completed a 30-yard pass to 
Escobar. Two plays later, Rodriguez scored on a one-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cavaliers only score came after a blocked punt by Tom Sokantrong, which 
gave Santiago the ball on the two. Christian Cortez scored on two-yard run on 
the next play. TED APODOCA

 Donald Kaufman, New York color consultant: "The most commonly overlooked thing 
for people making color choices is their own preference. They are made to feel 
by fashion dictates that they need to do things that are au courant or are 
important. That is the worst way to approach color. The best way is to look for 
things that are personal favorites and not care about what everyone says." 
</P>
<P>
 * Lin Yun, feng-shui expert: "Interior colors can affect your work. For 
example, if a color is too deep or too heavy, like black desks with 
coffee-colored walls, the business won't develop well because everyone will 
feel depressed and down. Then again, if the color is too bright, it could lead 
to corporate infighting." 
</P>
<P>
 * Clodagh, New York interior designer: "I think color has a huge effect on 
you. I would never paint a bedroom red, for instance. But I would paint the 
dining room red, a sort of brownish red. I like two kinds of bathrooms, because 
some shower in a brisk bathroom and bathe in a warm one. So for the brisk one I 
would do water and aqua glass and slate and very fresh white or aluminum. The 
other I would do in terra cotta, granite and copper. 
</P>
<P>
 * From Tricia Guild's "Country Color": "Paint and paper will take on a 
different color in your own home. For example, a predominantly white color 
scheme can seem creamy in a south-facing room bathed in warm sunlight, but take 
on a bluish tinge in a north-facing room. A west-facing room takes on the 
warmer light of afternoon, while an east-facing room will reflect the colder 
light of morning." 
</P>
<P>
 * Sarah Rossbach and Lin Yun from "Living Color": "For kitchens, white is the 
best color. It shows off the colors of food best, like a blank canvas upon 
which the cook creates a meal of red tomatoes, green peppers, yellow squash." 
</P>
<P>
 * Eugenia Au Kim, Southampton, N.Y., designer: "For a home office, do lots of 
natural woods, and I would suggest that one wall should be black. That 
encourages money. If the person is hyperkinetic, I would use softer colors on 
the walls. If they need stimulation, use jewel tones."

 Lost lines -- Some lines were inadvertently dropped in Kenneth Turan's review 
of "Quiz Show" in some editions of Friday's Calendar section. The paragraphs as 
written by Turan as are follows: 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, one of the focal points of any examination of the scandal has to be 
Van Doren, an intellectual golden boy whose downfall was classically tragic.And 
although he is beautifully played by Ralph Fiennes with a subtlety that is at 
least the equal of his Oscar-nominated performance in "Schindler's List," "Quiz 
Show" succeeds as well as it does because it is structured to make Van Doren's 
story only part of the whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Doing that structuring is screenwriter Attanasio, best known for having 
created the TV series "Homicide." Based loosely on a memoir by Richard Goodwin, 
a speech writer for President John F. Kennedy who began his Washington life as 
a congressional investigator looking into the scandal, Attanasio's script 
adroitly splits its focus three interconnected ways.
