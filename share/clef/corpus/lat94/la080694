DOCTOR PLANS $6-MILLION CLAIM OVER MYSTERY FUMES; MEDICINE: JULIE GORCHYNSKI, 
WHO SUFFERED KNEE DAMAGE, ACCUSES RIVERSIDE COUNTY OF STONEWALLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Because there is never a dull moment, never a routine, a career in emergency 
room medicine beckoned Dr. Julie Gorchynski. Standing on her feet 12 hours a 
day was a small price to pay for the most exciting and challenging career she 
could imagine. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 33-year-old physician said she never dreamed that emergency room work 
would send her into intensive care -- the victim of a bizarre poisoning that 
forced her to undergo serious knee surgery and that, for now, has left her 
unable to stand. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorchynski was the most seriously injured of six emergency room workers in 
what became known to the world as the "mystery fumes" case after a dying cancer 
patient was brought to Riverside General Hospital in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorchynski, who is on leave from Loma Linda University Medical Center, is 
ready to file a claim against Riverside County, angered by what she 
characterizes as the county's "stonewalling" her attempts to get to the bottom 
of the mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 A Riverside County spokeswoman would not comment on Gorchynski's threatened 
claim, which is a precursor to a civil lawsuit. But officials have steadfastly 
maintained that the aging county hospital wasn't the source of the mystery 
fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The impact on our employees, some of whom remain ill, greatly concerns us," 
hospital administrator Tomi Hadfield said in April after the emergency room's 
plumbing and ventilation systems were examined by industrial hygienists and 
others in search of a possible explanation. Based on those reviews, "any 
reasonable person must conclude that the hospital's facilities continue to be 
safe and effective," Hadfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy over the fumes began Feb. 19, when Gloria Ramirez, a 
31-year-old cancer patient, was brought to the county hospital's emergency room 
with serious breathing difficulties. The room was evacuated when Gorchynski and 
others fell ill after inhaling what she said were ammonia-like odors. The toxic 
fumes, Gorchynski believes, came from blood drawn from Ramirez minutes before 
she died. 
</P>
<P>
 Another doctor, two nurses and two therapists also complained of dizziness and 
nausea, and two of them, who also collapsed, were hospitalized for several 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gorchynski was hospitalized for two weeks with breathing problems, muscle 
spasms and pancreatitis, and today is recovering from avascular necrosis -- 
deterioration of her knee bones caused by lack of blood circulation. Her 
prognosis is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the worst pain I'd been in in my life," she said of the damage to her 
knees. "It shot up my thighs and down to my ankles." 
</P>
<P>
 Gorchynski believes that the bone destruction was the direct result of 
whatever toxins she unwittingly inhaled that night, because she had no 
pre-existing conditions that could explain what afflicted her. 
</P>
<P>
 She was in a wheelchair for three months and today, even with crutches, can 
only stand for 15 minutes at a time. Full recovery, after two surgeries in 
April to reintroduce blood flow to her knees, might take two years. If her body 
is unable to regenerate new bone, she will have to be fit with prosthetic 
joints. 
</P>
<P>
 Charging that Riverside County officials have botched the investigation into 
the highly publicized incident, Gorchynski said she will file a $6-million 
damages claim against the county Monday for emotional distress, medical costs 
and loss of earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of all, though, Gorchynski said she wants the answers to the question 
that continues to baffle scientists and medical experts: What were those 
mystery fumes? 
</P>
<P>
 "The frustration and the anger is with me every day," Gorchynski said. 
"Because of the stonewall from the county, we don't know 100% for certain what 
happened. But the people responsible need to be held accountable. (Emergency 
room) doctors don't go to work and expect to be poisoned." 
</P>
<P>
 Her attorney, Russell Kussman -- who is a former emergency room doctor and 
board-certified internist -- said the county's refusal to concurrently share 
the findings of its investigations with Gorchynski, to aid in her recovery, is 
suspicious. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county's behavior suggests either incompetence or a cover-up," he said. 
"It's hard to believe that they're that incompetent, and that leaves only one 
other alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we know is, something happened that night, and it either came from Gloria 
Ramirez or it came from the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez's family has filed its own wrongful-death claim against the county, 
contending that fumes in the hospital were responsible for her death. 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, the Riverside County coroner's office determined that Ramirez 
died of cardiac dysrhythmia and acute renal (kidney) failure brought on by 
cervical cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Kussman said it is his medical opinion that the only way cervical cancer could 
lead to kidney failure is if the tumor spread upward and obstructed both 
kidneys or both ureters, the tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the 
bladder. 
</P>
<P>
 The final, nine-page autopsy report was released Thursday, concluding the most 
bizarre autopsy in county history -- one in which the forensic pathologist and 
his assistant donned moon suits and entered a specially built examination 
chamber, to the fascination of gathered media and the public. 
</P>
<P>
 In his final report, pathologist Dr. Robert Ditraglia blamed the renal failure 
on "obstructive uropathy, kidney." But he made no reference to tumors affecting 
either the ureters or the kidneys -- a curious and bothersome omission, Kussman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still don't have all the answers," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 In a previously released toxicology summary report, the coroner's office said 
it found nothing in Ramirez's system that might explain the emission of toxic 
fumes. But the complete toxicology report has not yet been released -- and it 
is needed to explain chemical findings that otherwise make no sense, Gorchynski 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were missed opportunities in the investigation to collect clues, Kussman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the blood drawn from Ramirez was preserved, the syringe was 
disposed of in a hazardous materials container by an emergency room worker even 
as the staff was dropping to the floor, and later destroyed in the hospital 
incinerator before anyone thought to save it. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, no effort was made to shut off the emergency room's ventilation, 
to preserve whatever fumes might have been present. When the city Fire 
Department's hazardous-materials team probed the room for gases more than two 
hours later, nothing unusual was detected. 
</P>
<P>
 Kussman also complains that Ramirez's body -- double-bagged, then placed in a 
sealed aluminum casket -- was not preserved properly by the coroner's office in 
the days between her death and the autopsy, so that chemical agents could be 
better preserved. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal/OSHA, which investigates accidents in workplaces, and epidemiology experts 
with the state Department of Health Services are still investigating the 
incident but have not released either interim or final conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 One state official said he has never seen his office resort to "such high 
science" to try to get to the bottom of a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 But whether an answer will be forthcoming remains unclear. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no guarantee that our epidemiology study will find the answer to the 
mystery," said Scott Lewis, spokesman for the state health department. "Science 
doesn't yet have all the answers." 
</P>
<P>
 Gorchynski says she has no doubt that something poisoned her that night. Both 
she and the head emergency room doctor said they saw a mysterious, yellowish, 
spiked crystal in the syringe containing Ramirez's blood. When Gorchynski was 
treated later that night at a different hospital, a doctor and nurse there 
noted strange crystals in her own blood, Gorchynski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the absence so far of organic causes, some medical experts having no 
special insight into the Gorchynski case have publicly suggested that she and 
the others may have fallen victim to mass hysteria, perhaps prompted when one 
person in the emergency room legitimately fell sick for reasons unrelated to 
Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorchynski seethes at the speculation. "I had chemical burns in my throat and 
nose, lungs working at half-capacity, biopsies showing dead knees, a drop in 
enzyme levels and crystals in my blood as well. It's all medically documented," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She wonders if the culprit might be ethylene oxide, a toxic gas that is used 
to sterilize medical equipment and that causes symptoms identical to hers when 
a person is exposed to it. Riverside General Hospital has previously been cited 
by Cal/OSHA for improper handling of ethylene oxide. The syringe, however, was 
in a sealed container from an outside medical supplies distributor until it was 
opened and used on Ramirez, Gorchynski said. 
</P>
<P>
 She has received psychiatric help to deal with nightmares, traumatic 
flashbacks and her mixed feelings of anger and sadness over what has happened 
to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I learned of my prognosis," she said, "I was devastated. I thought I'd 
be back to work in a few months. Now it's been nearly six months and I still 
don't know. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm learning to be patient," she said. "I'm doing research on what's happened 
to me, I'm doing physical therapy, and I'm studying for my specialty board. I 
want to stay with emergency medicine."

DISPUTE OVER RIGHTS TO POG NAME IS NO GAME; COURT: UNIVERSAL POGS ASSN. IS 
SUING THE WORLD POG FEDERATION OVER ITS CLAIM OF TRADEMARK OWNERSHIP. OTHERS IN 
AN INDUSTRY EXPECTED TO HIT $1 BILLION IN SALES THIS YEAR KEEP TABS ON THE 
SKIRMISH.

<P>
 A three-letter word for the latest schoolyard rage has landed at the center of 
a high stakes legal battle that is being played out in an Orange County 
courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The word is POG. And the issue that will likely be settled during a jury trial 
this fall is who can legally market the name for the colorful, coin-sized disks 
that look like milk caps. 
</P>
<P>
 Universal Pogs Assn. Inc. is suing the World Pog Federation, disputing the 
federation's claims of exclusive rights to the name. It's a battle that the 
owner of Universal Pogs says he's prepared to fight all the way to the U.S. 
Supreme Court, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our position that the word POG is generic," said Robert B. Rosenstein, 
an attorney representing Universal Pogs. "Everybody in the world uses the name 
POG." 
</P>
<P>
 World Pog Federation attorneys, however, say the company holds the rights to 
the name and is seeking a court order barring Universal Pogs from using the 
P-word in its name and products. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the same claim made by people who have challenged the name Coke as being 
generic for soda, the same people who challenged Kleenex as being generic for 
tissue," said Michael Eidel, an attorney representing the World Pog Federation. 
"Those are still trademark names." 
</P>
<P>
 The legal dispute between the Orange County companies began last month and is 
being watched closely by other competitors in a fast-growing industry some 
predict could generate $1 billion this year alone. Universal Pogs estimates 
about 10 million milk caps are produced a week in California by just a fraction 
of the manufacturers that have become involved with the game in the past two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be the Hula-Hoops of '94 and '95," said Jim Mitchell, president 
and chief executive officer of Garden Grove-based Safeco Plastics Inc. and SPI 
KAPS, which manufactures milk cap products. "It's a fun game I love watching 
the kids play." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell is among those in the industry who believe POG should be used 
generically to describe the game, not milk caps as World Pog Federation has 
argued. 
</P>
<P>
 He challenges anyone to go out with a stack of regular milk caps and ask 
children and adults alike what they are called. 
</P>
<P>
 "You will get the same response from everybody," he said. "They are POGs." 
</P>
<P>
 The game itself in the middle of the fury is simple and played much like 
marbles, but with silver dollar-sized plastic and cardboard milk caps, similar 
to the flat circles once used to seal glass milk bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 Players hurl a heavier plastic disk known as a "slammer" or "kini" onto a 
stack of the cardboard caps. The trick is to flip the cardboard caps over by 
hitting them. Rules vary, with children playing for points or to keep the caps 
they successfully flip. Children also collect the disks, which are decorated 
with various logos, sayings, personalities and characters. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, the game has become so popular some local schools have 
banned it during recess and other breaks, citing concerns of gambling and 
disruption. Others, however, herald the game, similar to ones played with 
old-fashioned milk caps dating back to the 1920s, for encouraging social 
interaction and teaching sportsmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 As the legend of the game revival goes, a teacher at an Oahu elementary school 
rounded up milk covers from a Hawaiian dairy several years ago and introduced 
the game to her students. The disk of choice among the children was a cap for a 
drink of passion fruit, orange and guava, otherwise known as POG. Hence the 
name. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Rypinski, president and chief executive officer of World Pog Federation, 
said he competed against others and obtained in September, 1993, all rights to 
the POG brand name from the Haleakala Dairy for the game, as well as the fruit 
drink. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a company makes a very big success and pays attention as we have paid as 
a corporation to launching this brand and this wonderful kids' game for the 
world, there are always a number of (people) who want to tag along," Rypinski 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 His company sends hundreds of letters each week warning retailers and others 
that they can't use the name POG unless they are selling trademark products 
from the World Pog Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are interested in protecting our rights to the fullest extent," Rypinski 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Joe Kaufenberg, president of Universal Pogs, said others were using the 
name POG for their products long before World Pog Federation arrived on the 
scene. He disputes Rypinski's claims to exclusive name rights and says such 
claims restrict trade and give World Pog Federation an unfair business 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dairy sells juice, they don't sell POGs," Kaufenberg said. "And even if 
they had a trademark on their juice, that doesn't give them the rights to the 
paper POGs or the slammers." 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufenberg, whose company manufactures caps and slammers, said many retailers 
shy away from using other milk cap brands because they want to display the 
recognizable name of POG. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the retailers would know it's a generic name, it would be fair game for 
everybody to go out there and sell their POGs," he said. "It's a new hobby for 
the kids that they really enjoy. It's a cheap hobby for them to get into. It 
keeps the kids off the streets. They spend hours playing." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Orange County Superior Court Commissioner Jane D. Myers is 
considering motions from both sides on how to handle use of the word until the 
trial begins in November. Rosenstein, Kaufenberg's attorney, said the company 
is also taking federal action to dispute World Pog Federation's trademark 
application.  
</P>
<P>
 Kaufenberg said he'll take the case to the U.S. Supreme Court if he has to, 
adding: "There's just too many people in this country using POG."

ANAHEIM AIMS TO SCORE WITH STADIUM PLAY; DEVELOPMENT: CITY'S STRATEGY IS TO 
KEEP THE RAMS IN TOWN OR LURE ANOTHER TEAM BY RENOVATING THE BIG A AND 
REVITALIZING THE SURROUNDING AREA. COST ANALYSIS IS THE FIRST STEP. 
</P>

<P>
 City officials, determined to either keep the Los Angeles Rams at Anaheim 
Stadium or lure a new professional football team to town, will formally begin 
plans to refurbish the stadium and revitalize its surrounding area, officials 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 When the City Council meets Tuesday, it is expected to hire an accounting firm 
to analyze the cost of stadium renovation and begin a search for a consultant 
to develop a new land-use strategy for the entire stadium area. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said plans for the area, which also includes Anaheim Arena, 
need to be developed regardless of whether the Los Angeles Rams decide to stay 
in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "These actions are independent of efforts being taken to keep the Rams in 
Orange County," said City Manager James D. Ruth. "However, they may assist in 
either keeping the Rams or possibly attracting another NFL team." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams exercised a 15-month escape clause in their stadium contract in May 
and are being courted by several cities, including Baltimore and St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim officials said the council on Tuesday will be taking the first step in 
enhancing the long-term economic viability of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, this needs to be done," Mayor Tom Daly said. "We need an updated 
strategy for the two major assets that the city has: the stadium and the arena, 
and the area around them." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly said a "fresh look" at the area is needed because of the successful 
addition of the arena last year and the dwindling demand for high-rise office 
buildings in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials declined to discuss any specifics but have worked on plans to 
overhaul Anaheim Stadium to make it more profitable for the Rams and the 
California Angels baseball team, and have also examined ways to finance 
construction of a new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 By hiring a consultant, the city plans to explore land uses that would be 
complementary to both the arena and the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 They also want to explore transit possibilities -- such as the widening of the 
Santa Ana Freeway -- that would make the area more accessible and are looking 
at ways to link the stadium and arena with Anaheim resort areas, such as 
Disneyland, according to a city staff report. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they would like the revitalization to take place at no 
cost to taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 The accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche, which assisted in the renegotiation 
of the stadium lease with the Angels, is expected to be hired for $120,000 to 
establish and evaluate ways to generate money to pay for the improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Rams spokeswoman Heidi Sinclair said Friday that it would be premature for the 
team to comment on the city's plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it ends up having a positive effect on the Rams, great," Sinclair said. 
"But it doesn't really impact the Rams in any way at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 Save the Rams, the group of 45 local political and business people working to 
keep the team in Orange County, reacted positively Friday to the city's 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of this is inconsistent with the work of the Save the Rams committee 
and, in fact, enhances it," said County Supervisor William G. Steiner, a member 
of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have no timeline for when the team will announce its plans. An 
announcement related to the possible move will not be made before the football 
season begins in September, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Save the Rams hopes to unveil its proposal at the annual Rams booster luncheon 
Sept. 19.

CUSTOMER, FLEEING BANK ROBBER EXCHANGE GUNFIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A midday bank robbery turned into a shootout Friday when a customer pulled an 
unregistered derringer and exchanged fire with the fleeing robber, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robber escaped with an undetermined amount of money, while the customer -- 
a 45-year-old construction worker who sustained a minor facial cut from flying 
glass -- was taken into custody on weapons charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Phillip Seelinger, of Laguna Niguel, was cited and released Friday on 
misdemeanor charges of carrying a concealed weapon, discharging a weapon and 
delaying an investigation, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said a man entered the Hawthorne Savings branch in the 24400 block of 
Alicia Parkway at 11:22 a.m., displayed a handgun and demanded money. 
</P>
<P>
 After he left the building through the front door, the customer emptied his 
two-shot pistol through the glass door at the suspect, sheriff's Lt. Dan 
Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robber turned, fired two shots into the bank and fled north on the Santa 
Ana Freeway in a late model, green compact car. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said that police were at the scene within four minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerry Clark was with a client at the nearby Village Gallery when the shots 
sent her scrambling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember saying, 'I guess we live a sheltered life (in) Mission Viejo." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Sgt. Al Coutts said the shootout was "kind of an unusual situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Coutts said he advises people against confronting bank robbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd much rather have a good witness give a good description of a car or 
license plate or clothing rather than jeopardize your safety or anybody else in 
that parking lot or inside that bank," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI Special Agent David Struck in Santa Ana agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't recommend confronting any armed suspect by anyone, even trained law 
enforcement," Struck said. "At best, it is hazardous and at worst, deadly. . . 
. We especially do not want any untrained individual confronting an armed bank 
robber. If an individual is armed, the potential for injury or death is quite 
high." 
</P>
<P>
 Struck said that the gunman who held up the bank "is not a repeat robber, 
although that possibility always exists." 
</P>
<P>
 Struck said the FBI plans to examine the bank's surveillance tape. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mission Viejo robbery comes two days after a suspected bank robber died in 
a confrontation with police in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Times correspondent Jeff Bean contributed to the report.

MIXED RECEPTION; VIETNAMESE STATION FACES CRITICS WHO SAY BROADCAST BACKS 
COMMUNIST AGENDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 She expected controversy, but Trang Nguyen was stunned by the organized 
protests when she started broadcasting interviews with Vietnamese government 
officials over the airwaves of Orange County's Little Saigon Radio. 
</P>
<P>
 Since June 20, the fledgling Vietnamese-language radio station in Santa Ana 
has been airing the interviews with Communist leaders conducted by the British 
Broadcasting Corp. Nguyen said she believed broadcasting them was a service to 
the Vietnamese American community. 
</P>
<P>
 While several Vietnamese leaders have cheered the broadcasts, others in the 
community are angered, saying the radio station is providing a forum for the 
Communists' effort to solicit cooperation from Vietnamese in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vietnamese Communists are focusing their efforts on infiltrating the overseas 
Vietnamese communities to maintain a Communist regime that betrays the 
Vietnamese people," opponents of the broadcasts said in a statement after a 
protest meeting Sunday in Westminster's Little Saigon business district. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 Vietnamese Americans who attended the meeting, organized by the 
Committee to Protect Human Rights in Vietnam, demanded that Little Saigon Radio 
stop the broadcasts immediately. In their statement, they urged Vietnamese 
"political refugees" to oppose all news broadcasts that would benefit the 
"false regime in Hanoi." 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen, 35, president of Little Saigon Radio, which began operation just a 
year ago, said she was stunned by the response.  
</P>
<P>
 "But we're not going to change our way of broadcasting," said Nguyen, who 
holds a linguistics degree from San Diego State University. "We'll practice 
journalism the way we learned how to do it in America." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she and her employees have received death threats, including 
anonymous calls threatening to bomb the radio station. One call came just days 
after the first broadcast June 20, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen said she has been unable to establish that the threats were coming from 
those openly opposed to the broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
 During a reception in Westminster for two BBC executives who visited the radio 
station last week, Nguyen said an anonymous caller told the owner of the 
restaurant where the reception was being held that a bomb was planted on the 
roof and was ready to explode. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the building was not vacated. The threats turned out to be a hoax, 
said John Thai, Nguyen's husband, who helps run the station. 
</P>
<P>
 Thai said the callers might have been trying to frighten the radio station's 
employees, without any intention to carry out the threats. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that initial efforts were made to report the threats to the 
Westminster and Santa Ana police, but these were not followed through because 
"we're not overly worried." 
</P>
<P>
 The Westminster and Santa Ana police said they have not received formal 
complaints about the bomb and death threats. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a Los Angeles Times Poll conducted earlier this year, only a 
minority of Orange County's Vietnamese community staunchly opposes the 
resumption of relations with Vietnam's Communist regime. 
</P>
<P>
 Little Saigon Radio, which has 16 hours of Vietnamese-language programming 
daily starting at 6 a.m., obtained the rights to broadcast live BBC reports 
from London. 
</P>
<P>
 The half-hour morning broadcasts in Vietnamese feature news reports from 
inside Vietnam and around the world, commentaries, and interviews with world 
leaders. The BBC is a revered institution in Vietnam, and about 6 million 
people there listen to the broadcasts daily, Nguyen said. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple said bringing the BBC broadcasts to Orange County was a coup that 
the radio station had hoped would boost its credibility within the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made history," Thai said. "I think some people are jealous that we can 
provide this kind of service to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 But broadcasting the interviews sparked an emotional debate over whether 
Vietnam's Communist leaders should be given a forum to reach Vietnamese 
immigrants in the United States. One interview was with the petroleum executive 
director and another was with a Vietnamese doctor who had conducted studies of 
malnutrition among Vietnamese children. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents said the interviews were nothing more than Communist propaganda, but 
other community leaders said the discussions were "healthy for the community," 
and in a free country like the United States there should be no censorship. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're advocating for democracy, you must be prepared to practice it," 
said Judy Stowe, head of the BBC Vietnamese section, who visited the radio 
station last week with longtime BBC announcer Do Van. 
</P>
<P>
 Stowe said she finds it odd that Vietnamese Americans would denounce the BBC 
broadcasts, which Hanoi leaders consider anti-Communist propaganda. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get criticized from both directions," Stowe said. "We feel we're doing it 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that many Vietnamese have told her that they listened to the BBC 
despite the threat of danger to themselves while in Vietnam. It is ironic, she 
said, that now that they are free in America, others would want to censor the 
broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Van, who broadcast the fall of Saigon in 1975 using reports from fellow BBC 
reporters inside Vietnam, said that many Vietnamese just don't want to hear the 
voices of the Communist leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people have caused them so much suffering," Van said. "They don't want 
to listen, regardless of what they (Communists) are saying." 
</P>
<P>
 Quynh N. Nguyen, a member of the South Vietnamese Navy Veterans Assn., said 
the Communists "don't necessarily tell the truth. I don't think it's good to 
help them voice their opinions in public."  
</P>
<P>
 But Mai Cong, head of the Vietnamese American Community of Orange County, said 
that Little Saigon Radio provides a service to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "As individuals, we can exercise our own judgment whether we want to listen to 
a particular program or not," she said. "It's needed in the community, 
especially for people who have difficulty following news in English."

'I WANT TO LIVE . . . WHERE THEY LOVE ME'; COURTS: STATE FORCED DISABLED WOMAN 
TO LEAVE COUPLE THAT CARED FOR HER AND MOVE TO A BOARD- AND-CARE HOME. NOW 
SHE'S SUING TO GO BACK. 
</P>

<P>
 Tracy Grimes would like to live with people who love her and take care of her. 
She would like a room of her own and to be near children during the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Until a few months ago, Grimes -- who is severely disabled from a brain stem 
injury -- was living with a Chatsworth family who gave her all these things. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the state took them away. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the family home in a residential neighborhood did not have a community 
care facility license, officials from the state Department of Social Services 
ordered Grimes to leave, threatening the family with a $200 fine for every day 
she stayed. 
</P>
<P>
 So in April, Grimes, 32, moved to a Northridge board-and-care facility where 
she has no privacy, where her only entertainment is television and where many 
of the other residents are too sick to talk. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, Grimes filed a lawsuit 
Friday against the Social Services Department asking that she be able to return 
to the place she considers home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just like what everybody likes," said Grimes during an interview in the 
living room of Gabrielle and Frederick Hanna, the couple she lived with. This 
was Grimes' first visit to the house since she was forced to move. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes' speech is slurred, but she is alert and enjoys talking. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just like a normal person. I want to live in a place where they love me 
and I'm in the family," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this basically comes down to is the right of disabled people to choose 
where they want to live," said Beth Osthimer, a lawyer with San Fernando Valley 
Neighborhood Legal Services, which is also representing Grimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes' situation falls through the cracks of current state policies. 
Regulations allow family members to care for their elderly and disabled 
relatives in homes without a license. The state also encourages people to 
return to their own homes after the onset of a disability by providing In-Home 
Support Services payments. 
</P>
<P>
 But state Social Services Department officials say all other severely disabled 
people must live in a licensed facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone who is disabled and is not covered by another law cannot choose to 
live just anywhere," said David Dodds, a program development chief at the 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 For Grimes, the issue is not simply one of personal choice. The facility where 
she now lives charges about $1,000 a month for room, board and care. Her Social 
Security benefits, which are her sole means of support, come to about $650 a 
month. The deficit has been made up since April by a friend and by members of 
Grimes' church. 
</P>
<P>
 Now those funds have dried up. Attempts to find a less expensive facility that 
will take someone with Grimes' disability have been unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 "If something doesn't happen," said Esther Epstein of Neighborhood Legal 
Services, "Tracy will be homeless as of Sept. 7." 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes suffered her brain stem hemorrhage in 1987 when she was seven months 
pregnant. The child was successfully delivered, prematurely, and now lives with 
Grimes' mother.  
</P>
<P>
 The injury left Grimes paralyzed on her left side, partially paralyzed on the 
right side and partly blind. She needs assistance to move her wheelchair, 
dress, shower and use the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes said her life was barren until she met the Hannas in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "She became like our sister," said Gabrielle Hanna. The family visited her 
regularly at the facility, a different one from where she now lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, they asked her if she would like to move in with them. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Hannas' home she had her own room. Gabrielle Hanna quit her job as a 
computer operator to stay home with her. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes contributed $528 out of her Social Security benefits toward the house's 
rent. She and the family expected that she would also be able to designate 
Gabrielle as her care giver and pay her the approximately $900 a month she 
expected to get in state benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 But a government inspector in March said the house would need to be licensed. 
</P>
<P>
 To get a license, the house would have needed a major remodeling to conform to 
state regulations. But then Grimes would no longer have been eligible for state 
benefits: The payments are meant for people being cared for at home, not at a 
licensed facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes said she has faith that she will be back with the Hannas. "I think God 
put his hand on my shoulder and said, 'You'll be OK.' "

PROTEST OVER POLICE BEATING CONTINUES; COMPTON: LATINO LEADERS DECRY WHAT THEY 
CALL LONGSTANDING DISCRIMINATION IN THE CITY'S HIRING PRACTICES AND LACK OF 
REPRESENTATION IN POWER STRUCTURE DESPITE BEING HALF OF THE POPULATION. 
</P>

<P>
 For the second consecutive day, Latino leaders gathered outside Compton City 
Hall on Friday to protest the police beating of an unarmed teen-ager and to 
criticize what some described as continuing racial conflict in a city run by 
blacks but occupied by a growing population of Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is racism perpetrated by one minority group against another," Pedro 
Pallan, former president of the city's Latino Chamber of Commerce, said of last 
week's beating of 17-year-old Felipe Soltero by a black police officer. "Have 
the oppressed now decided to become oppressors?" 
</P>
<P>
 The incident, captured by a neighbor's video camera and widely played on 
television, has been compared by some Latino activists to the videotaped 
beating of black motorist Rodney G. King. Protesters have demanded an apology 
from Compton Mayor Omar Bradley and the resignation of Police Chief Hourie 
Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, as Taylor left for a fishing trip delayed by the controversy, 
demonstrators also took aim at what they called longstanding discrimination in 
the city's hiring practices and the lack of Latino representation in Compton's 
power structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Over 50% of the population here is Latino, and we get zero respect, zero 
response to our concerns at City Hall," said Latino chamber President Arnulfo 
Alatorre Jr., who called for an end to what he termed "Compton's racism." 
</P>
<P>
 "Latinos are treated worse by city officials than the blacks were treated by 
whites in South Africa," Alatorre said. "We don't want an apology -- we want 
people in City Hall. We want somebody to represent us." 
</P>
<P>
 About 80 Latinos, many hoisting Spanish-language signs, took part in the 
protest, one of the most visible signs of racial tension in a city whose black 
population has steadily dwindled since peaking at 73% in 1980. By 1990, 
according to U.S. census figures, the black population had dropped to 53% while 
Latino's made up 44% of all residents. City leaders now estimate that Latinos 
represent a 51% majority. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of those shifts, no Latino has ever been on the City Council and all 
the city's top leadership is black. The seven-member school board, which 
oversees a mostly Latino student population, has just one Latino member. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the city's 125 police officers, 73 are African American, 14 are Latino, 34 
are white and four are of other races. 
</P>
<P>
 Tension between Latino and African American students erupted at all three 
Compton high schools last fall, causing one school to be closed for a day after 
brawls broke out. In each case, the combatants were divided along racial lines 
and involved dozens of students, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton Mayor Omar Bradley, whom protesters criticized for saying Wednesday 
that he had "no reaction" to the beating administered by Officer Michael 
Jackson, defended the city's employment practices by saying the city has 
suffered cutbacks in recent years and there has been minimal hiring. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged that there are no Latinos working in City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, this is a dual responsibility," Bradley said. "While the city has a 
responsibility to hire Latinos, so should Latinos hire African Americans, and 
they aren't doing it. So it goes both ways."  
</P>
<P>
 Bradley said the legal issues precluded him from commenting on the videotape, 
first seen Tuesday. The beating is the subject of a grand jury investigation, 
as well as an internal probe by the Compton Police Department, the FBI and the 
district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There is the potential for criminal as well as civil legal action in this  
</P>
<P>
 case and, because I represent a $114-million corporation, which is the city of 
Compton, I must temper my remarks," Bradley said from his home Friday. (City 
Hall is closed on Fridays.) "But certainly I never intended to offend anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Xavier Hermosillo, founder of a Mexican American activist organization called 
NEWS for America, criticized Bradley's stance: "When the beating of Rodney King 
was shown, everyone reacted. . . . I seriously doubt (he was) blank-faced about 
the Rodney King incident." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the angry rhetoric decrying racism, Latino and black leaders said they 
hoped that the demonstrations would create some unity between the races. 
</P>
<P>
 Black leaders present for the picketing, mostly from the Compton chapter of 
the National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People, said they were 
concerned about the possibility of rhetoric fueling racial tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can end up with a real serious problem here and that's why we're here," 
said local NAACP President Royce Esters, who repeatedly warned of racial 
trouble brewing in Compton. "We need to respect each other's concerns, get 
together and talk." 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, Latino and African American leaders from South-Central Los Angeles 
united to downplay the racial significance of the beating, which occurred at 
the Westland trailer park. Representatives of the Community Coalition, a 
multicultural group, and members of the Bethel African Methodist Episcopal 
Church held a news conference in front of the church on Florence Avenue, where 
some leaders denounced police brutality regardless of its targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Moss, president of the Men's Group at Bethel, said the black community 
must be quick to speak out against such brutality even when the victim is not 
an African American. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did we wait for the grand jury when it came to Rodney King?" Moss asked. "We 
must realize that whatever happens to them, happens to us, whether it is a 
Hispanic child or any person of color." 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvia Castillo, president of Neighborhoods Fighting Back, told reporters that 
many Latinos believe that the issue of police brutality crosses racial 
boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since we (Latinos and blacks) live side by side, we share many of the same 
problems," Castillo said. "That is why this is not an issue of race, it is 
simply about police accountability."

L.A. HOMICIDES DROP 28% IN 1ST HALF ALONG WITH OTHER CRIMES; VIOLENCE: DECLINE 
IS LINKED IN PART TO COMMUNITY POLICING AND INCREASED POLICE PRESENCE AFTER THE 
QUAKE AND DURING WORLD CUP. THE NUMBER OF ANNUAL MURDERS COULD FALL BELOW 1,000 
FOR FIRST TIME SINCE 1989. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A citywide downturn in violent crime last year has continued during the first 
half of 1994 -- raising the hope that Los Angeles' annual homicide mark could 
drop below 1,000 for the first time since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Police Department statistics show that the number of homicides 
in Los Angeles plummeted 28% in the first half of this year compared to the 
same period in 1993. Citywide, 376 homicides were reported during the first six 
months of 1994, compared to 525 during the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Robberies fell in the first half of 1994 fell 19%. The number of aggravated 
assaults dropped 12%. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say the decrease may result in part from a higher police presence 
linked to community policing efforts, and to unusual events such as the 
Northridge earthquake in January and the World Cup this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Other factors may include more active neighborhood crime prevention 
activities, an increased police focus on areas with high-crime clusters, a 
continuing truce among some African American street gangs in South-Central Los 
Angeles and a Mexican Mafia edict against drive-by shootings that has cooled 
tensions among many Latino gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's "three strikes" law, enacted in March to lengthen prison terms for 
repeat felony offenders, is probably too new to have had much of an impact, 
police officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 However, authorities acknowledge that all such hypotheses are no more than 
informed speculation about what could be an emerging trend -- but could also 
turn out to be a mere blip on the criminal radar screen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is encouraging," Deputy Police Chief Mark Kroeker said. "But I guess the 
last thing we should all do is say, 'Oh, it's because of certain strategies 
we're talking about in police work.' If you start taking credit for crime 
decreases, you better start getting ready to take the blame for crime increases 
as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, authorities say, the downward trend is only relative. The FBI's 
latest national figures showed that the rate of violent crime in Los Angeles -- 
1,778 per 100,000 people in 1992 -- was almost 44% higher than in the New York 
metropolitan area. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of compare it to a patient with an abnormally high fever," said 
Kroeker, who supervises the LAPD's South Bureau. "Suddenly, we may see a 
decline in the fever -- but the patient is still very sick. In the same way, 
the crime load is still very high and people aren't ready to say, 'Hey, we feel 
just fine about our neighborhood.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The new LAPD statistics show an overall decrease in major felonies in every 
police division in the city during the first six months of 1994. All 18 
divisions except for the Harbor Division also reported a decrease in the four 
most common violent crimes -- homicide, rape, robbery and aggravated assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Divisions showing the largest decreases in violent crime were West Los 
Angeles, down 25%; 77th Street, down 22%, and Rampart, down 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 In Rampart, which includes the MacArthur Park neighborhood, there were 3,306 
violent crimes, compared to 4,126 during the first six months last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Dan Hills, commanding officer of the Rampart detective bureau, said the 
devastating earthquake displaced tenants in some of the area's most overcrowded 
and transient-filled apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you take a significant number of these people and put them somewhere 
else because the buildings are uninhabitable, that will bring your crime rate 
down," Hills said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then in June, the LAPD's tough Metro Division was deployed to Rampart. Its 
mission, Hills said, was to discourage over-exuberant World Cup celebrations in 
the neighborhood, whose predominantly Central American immigrant population 
includes many soccer enthusiasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Metro comes in, it's like doubling the number of street officers," Hills 
said. "We had a 40% reduction in street robberies during that month alone." 
</P>
<P>
 After homicides dropped 30% citywide during the first quarter of 1994, some 
criminologists attributed the decline squarely on the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But Assistant Chief Bernard Parks said the dip cannot be traced solely to the 
quake because it began well before the earth shook, and has picked up speed 
more recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime you have a major unusual occurrence such as an earthquake, that does 
have an impact," Parks said. "Crime drops significantly. But now we're into 
August and the trend has continued for another six months. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, you might have had one bureau where crime was up and another 
where crime was down and they balanced each other. 1993 was the first time in 
my memory where all 18 divisions had a crime reduction and in 1994 they are all 
down again." 
</P>
<P>
 Parks said the key factor is more police on the street, which has occurred at 
various times in preparation for the trials stemming from the police beating of 
Rodney G. King and from the 1992 riots that resulted after four LAPD officers 
were found not guilty in the initial state trial stemming from the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot has to do with deployment," Parks said. "There's been a number of 
unusual events such as the trials which have resulted in putting more police on 
the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 The city's major crime decrease reflects similar trends in Southern California 
and nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the FBI, serious crimes reported to police dropped 3% nationwide 
last year after increases of 1% in 1992, 5% in 1991 and 11% in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime in Ventura County fell 9.1% in 1993. In the first five months of 1994, 
in areas of Los Angeles County patrolled by sheriff's deputies, homicides were 
down 8%, rapes 23%, robberies, 8% and aggravated assaults 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 USC sociology professor Daniel Glaser said the main reason that violence is 
decreasing may be the aging of the nation's population. "Most of the violent 
crime is committed by young people roughly 15 to 25 years old. And they are 
becoming a smaller proportion of the population." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there is widespread perception that the crime rate is getting worse. 
"Although the number of crimes is declining," Glaser said, "the amount of space 
in the newspapers and the amount of time on the TV media devoted to crime has 
been going up. 
</P>
<P>
 "The media grasps what the people pay attention to." A Less Violent City Here 
are four major categories of violent crimes reported to the Los Angeles Police 
Department for the first six months of 1994 compared tothe first six months of 
1993, and homicide totals since 1988: Homicide 1994: 376 1993: 525 * Forcible 
Rape 1994: 821 1993: 861 * Robbery 1994: 15,262 1993: 18,811 * Aggravated 
Assault 1994: 19,154 1993: 21,852 * Yearly Homicide Totals For The City of Los

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: BEVERLY HILLS; CITY 
COUNCIL CONSIDERING SWEEPING BAN ON SMOKING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Beverly Hills is considering a ban on smoking in all restaurants, bars and 
workplaces and in some outdoor areas, a measure supporters say would rank as 
one of the toughest anti-smoking laws in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban, which will be the subject of a public hearing Sept. 13, would be 
broader than smoking restrictions adopted by such cities as Los Angeles and 
Santa Monica, and more comprehensive than the statewide anti-smoking measure 
Gov. Pete Wilson signed into law last month.That law, scheduled to take effect 
Jan. 1, prohibits smoking in restaurants and most indoor workplaces, but 
exempts bars and hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 If the ban is enacted, Beverly Hills would snuff out smoking in all 
restaurants, bars, outdoor dining areas, hotel lobbies, workplaces with any 
employee other than a sole proprietor, and all city-owned outdoor areas, such 
as parks. Other cities, including Los Angeles and Santa Monica, have passed 
measures that prohibit smoking in restaurants and some workplaces, but still 
allow people to light up in bars and outdoor dining areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills City Council members said the proposed anti-smoking ordinance, 
now being drafted, may be modified after next month's hearing, which is 
expected to draw hoteliers, restaurateurs and others likely to criticize the 
measure.

<P>
 Irvine attorney Roy Brown has been named chairman of the United Way's 
1994-1995 fund-raising campaign in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, a managing partner with the Ernst & Young law firm, will be in charge 
of planning the campaign and selecting volunteers to help coordinate the 
effort, which last year netted $19.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "His primary function is to bring the business community together and rally 
for the needs of the community," said Jeff Urbaniec, senior marketing manager 
for the United Way. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown must "pull the business resources together to make a difference," 
Urbaniec said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 23% of the money raised by the United Way comes from corporate 
donations. About 70% come from donations by company employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Urbaniec said that Brown's position as the managing partner of a prestigious 
law firm gives him the status and contacts needed to reach out to the business 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is a peer-to-peer process," Urbaniec said. "He is a community 
leader and a business leader. He is asking other business leaders to (have) the 
same commitment to the community that he does." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown could not be reached for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The new fund-raising campaign gets underway in September. Contributions are 
used to support more than 1,000 service organizations that provide everything 
from child care to meals for homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme of the 1994-1995 campaign is "Be A Local Hero." 
</P>
<P>
 "What we've heard in the community is that (people) want their money to stay 
in Orange County," Urbaniec said. "The idea behind (the slogan) is that the 
(donations) are used locally." SHELBY GRAD

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; OLDER CARS DRAW YOUNG ADMIRERS

 Yaldoh Satar liked the sleek 1988 Lotus so much that she wants three of them 
-- black, red and white. But she'll first have to get a driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very fun," she said of her stationary test drive. Driving a car is a 
few years off for the 8-year-old, but she got the general idea when some Los 
Angeles car collectors brought their customized models to the Boys and Girls 
Club of Buena Park Friday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the five other cars in the show, including several 1950s classics, the 
Lotus "is mostly for people to look at," said owner Beto Garcia of Huntington 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park resident Anthony Chavez, 11, seemed to be knowledgeable about cars 
already. "I've always liked the style," he said of the Lotus. But his favorite 
is a Ferrari. 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 children with the Boys and Girls Club checked out the seats, 
engines, chrome work and wide whitewall tires during the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets them away from gangs," said club athletic director Ralph Cervantes, 
who organized the event. "It's a positive thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Youngsters took turns bouncing in the back seat of a two-toned 1954 Chevy 
sedan, which had been restored to pristine condition by owner Ricky Tula of 
Bassett. "It's fun," said Christopher Butts, 8, of Buena Park, as he waited to 
climb in. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Mejico of Rancho Cucamonga placed mirrors under the body of his 1966 
Volkswagen convertible so the youths could see the chrome underneath. "Kids 
really get a kick out of the murals," Mejico said, noting the elaborate claw 
design painted on the bumpers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks all cool, and it has pictures on it," said Richard Nealand, 8, of 
the convertible.LESLEY WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; THRONGS EXPECTED AT 46TH CORN FESTIVAL

<P>
 More than 60,000 people are expected to attend the 46th annual Corn Festival, 
which began Friday night and continues today with a parade at 9:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Featuring celebrities, marching bands, horse groups, antique cars and floats, 
it will travel about a mile east on La Habra Boulevard from Idaho Street to El 
Centro-Lions Park on Cypress Street. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's grand marshal is Paul Goldenberg, a local businessman and 
philanthropist. 
</P>
<P>
 Corn Festival chairman Chuck Overbey said he expects to sell 15,000 ears of 
corn this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The La Habra Host Lions Club sponsors the festival, which began as a way to 
raise money for local charities in 1948. Since then, nonprofit organizations 
and clubs have offered corn, other food, rides and game booths at the park. 
Last year's event raised about $45,000. MIMI KO

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; OFFICIALS, 
UNION PACIFIC OK PACT ON ALAMEDA CORRIDOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Local officials predicted a significant economic boom to the region Friday as 
the long-awaited Alameda Corridor rail project took another step closer to 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles and Long Beach port officials concluded negotiations this week 
with Union Pacific Railroad, the last of three freight haulers participating in 
the $1.8-billion transit link from the harbor area to Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today's agreement moves the corridor from a dream to a reality," Mayor 
Richard Riordan said. "This agreement with Union Pacific railroad puts us on 
the fast track into the 21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
 The next step is securing nearly $1 billion in state and federal funding for 
the 20-mile transit link. The project is designed to greatly accelerate cargo 
shipments coming into local harbors by loading freight directly onto high-speed 
trains. It could be completed by the turn of the century.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; PLANNING 
PANEL APPROVES HOME-BASED BUSINESSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city has moved a step closer to allowing businesses to operate in 
residential areas, with a panel voting unanimously this week to legalize more 
than two dozen home-based occupations. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote by the city's Planning Commission came nearly 10 years after 
officials began to study whether to change zoning codes that prohibit 
commercial operations in residential neighborhoods.Only doctors, dentists and 
ministers are allowed to conduct business in their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the City Council, the ordinance would bring Los Angeles in line 
with dozens of other municipalities in Southern California that have legalized 
home-based businesses, and which are collecting fees on the operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission's decision followed more than three hours of testimony 
from homeowners, most of whom fear that the law would turn residential 
neighborhoods into crowded commercial districts, as well as comments from home 
business supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an unfair burden on residential communities that are trying to 
establish a peaceful, restful and quiet atmosphere," said Alan Kishbaugh, 
president of the Federation of Hillside and Canyon Assn., which represents 
about 250,000 residents on both sides of the Santa Monica Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of home-based businesses testified at the hearing that they are 
happy the city is finally attempting to legalize such enterprises, but they 
criticized many restrictions in the proposed law.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; WOMAN, 4 
MEN CHARGED IN BANK SLAYING, HOLDUPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Five people were charged Friday in connection with two bank robberies, 
including one in San Pedro in which a security guard was killed and another in 
Los Angeles in which a guard was shot in the back.  
</P>
<P>
 Four men and one woman are accused in the July 20 robbery of the Home Bank in 
San Pedro and the July 26 robbery of the Gilmore Bank in Los Angeles.Security 
guard Juan Corona was shot and killed at the San Pedro bank. Gabriel Gomez, a 
guard at the Gilmore Bank at 6291 W. 3rd St., was wounded in that robbery.  
</P>
<P>
 Sonja Key, 27, William Blackwell, 27, Zoelee Issac, 22, Timothy Williams, 22, 
and Deon Flowers, 20, were arrested outside Wells Fargo Bank at 6324 Sunset 
Blvd. in Hollywood. Deputy Dist. Atty. Terry Bork of the office's Career 
Criminal Division said some of the charges against the defendants include their 
alleged planned attempt to hold up the Hollywood bank.  
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the defendants face murder charges, Key is additionally 
charged with murder with special circumstances in connection with the San Pedro 
security guard's killing. Key also faces counts of attempted murder, assault 
with a firearm, commercial burglary, attempted burglary, conspiracy to commit 
robbery and robbery.  
</P>
<P>
 If convicted on all charges, Key would face the death penalty. Blackwell, 
Issac and Flowers would each face maximum prison terms of 25 years to life. 
Williams would face three years and eight months in prison. A 17-year-old girl 
is being prosecuted by juvenile authorities.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; RV PARKING BAN PROPOSAL DROPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan to prohibit people from parking motor homes, boats and other oversize 
vehicles in their driveways drew protests from owners of recreational vehicles 
this week, prompting the City Council to drop the idea.  
</P>
<P>
 The stiffer regulations were proposed because of resident complaints that 
recreational vehicles are unsightly and block visibility for drivers and 
pedestrians, said associate planner Susan Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 But a number of residents expressed concerns about the proposed revision to 
the city's zoning ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Polkow,a resident since 1971 who bought her home because there was enough 
room to park a recreational vehicle, said the proposed regulations would force 
people to put their recreation vehicles in public storage. She said local 
storage facilities are full, and if the proposed regulations were approved, it 
would have left RV owners in a bind. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pierce said there "are just as many people who would love to have (the 
proposed regulations) stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Existing regulations allow recreational vehicles to be stored on a paved 
driveway or paved area on the homeowner's property.  
</P>
<P>
 The matter still must be voted on by the council, because the Planning 
Commission has recommended that the proposed regulations be incorporated into 
the final draft of the revised zoning code.DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; TRAPPING APPROVED TO CONTROL SKUNKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city, county and community have agreed to a plan of attack to rid a 
neighborhood near Central Park of skunks, city officials said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan includes a mass trapping effort and a public education program, Mayor 
Linda Moulton Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton Patterson said city officials met Wednesday with Supervisor Harriett 
M. Wieder, county Animal Control officials, city staff members and 
representatives of the neighborhood. As a result, the City Council will 
consider hiring a private trapper at its Aug. 15 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very serious problem," Moulton Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Skunks have overrun the Franciscan Fountains neighborhood, southwest of Golden 
West Street and Slater Avenue. Residents made their pleas to the council this 
week to do something about the "smelly" problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Wieder said county Animal Control will assist by educating residents on how 
they can discourage skunk invasions of their properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Hagan, community services director, said the council will consider 
spending up to $3,000 to trap and relocate the animals to the wilderness. He 
said trappers charge $25 a skunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagan said between 200 to 500 skunks live near the neighborhood and the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagan said the growing skunk problem is due to nearby development, recent 
library construction and grading at Central Park, which is causing the animals 
to search for new homes and food.  
</P>
<P>
 He said of the 300 acres of wildlife area at the park, the habitat can support 
a population of only 30 to 60 skunks. The animals are also making their homes 
in nearby flood channels. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents said that the skunks are spraying people and their pets and are 
falling into swimming pools and drowning.  
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Barbara told the council that he and his wife were confronted recently 
by three skunks in their back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We became prisoners in our own home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For $330, Barbara hired a trapper who caught nine skunks on his property. He 
also has spent about $200 to place a screen eight inches below the bottom of 
his fence to keep the skunks out.  
</P>
<P>
 Barbara said skunks are a problem in other areas of the city as well, but his 
neighborhood is experiencing an increasing infestation.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a simple problem; it's an epidemic," Barbara said. "Skunks are 
procreating like mad." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara, who met with city and county officials Wednesday, said he's in favor 
of trapping the skunks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to kill skunks; they're cute little animals," he said. "We just 
want them relocated. We don't want them in our back yards." 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton Patterson said residents should take these steps to discourage skunks: 
</P>
<P>
 * Do not leave pet food outside.  
</P>
<P>
 * Cover trash containers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't leave plastic trash bags outside. 
</P>
<P>
 * Remove garbage, debris and lumber piles outside. 
</P>
<P>
 * Clear dense vegetation on property. 
</P>
<P>
 * Eliminate access points, such as fencing, decks and house foundations, by 
sealing them. DEBRA CANO

 An Irvine business has agreed to stop selling belt buckle knives and "cane 
swords" and to pay $7,500 in costs and civil penalties in the wake of a 
consumer protection lawsuit filed against it by the Orange County district 
attorney's office, prosecutors said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Without admitting liability, the company, Ken Nolan Inc. and its president, 
William C. Warren, agreed to resolve the lawsuit that was filed Thursday, 
according to a statement released by the district attorney's office.The lawsuit 
contended that the sale of the items by Nolan violated state law prohibiting 
the sale of such concealed weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the company could not be reached for comment Friday evening. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit defined a belt buckle knife as a knife that is "made an integral 
part of a belt buckle and consists of a blade with a length of at least 2 1/2 
inches." A cane sword was defined as a "cane, swagger stick, stick, staff, rod, 
pole, umbrella or similar device having concealed within it a blade that may be 
used as a sword or stiletto." LESLIE BERKMAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; SCHOOL DISTRICT, CITY WORK OUT GYM DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 School district and city officials have reached an agreement over the use of a 
planned gymnasium to be built between Yorba Linda Middle School and Hurless 
Barton Park.  
</P>
<P>
 The pact gives Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District use of the 
facility during school hours and after school until 5 p.m. on school days.The 
city will get the gym after 5 p.m. during the week and on weekends and 
holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement was approved Tuesday by the City Council and the district's 
Board of Trustees. Groundbreaking for the project is scheduled for Sept. 24, 
and city officials expect the gym to be completed by next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations between the district and the city bogged down this summer when 
the district objected to the city's method of financing the $2.5-million 
project. District officials contended that, although the city wanted to use 
redevelopment money it had agreed to give the district to pay for the gym, the 
district would not be a co-owner of the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Although that issue has not been settled and the district is still considering 
a lawsuit to decide how the redevelopment money should be spent, both sides 
agreed to put the subject of money aside for now.  
</P>
<P>
 Two other obstacles to a concord were removed when the city dropped its 
request for a strip of district-owned land behind City Hall as part of the 
project and removed a clause that would allow the city to evict the district 
from the facility without cause after one year.

 "That was a reasonable concern," said Assistant City Manager David Gruchow. 
"We changed that aspect. Now the city can only evict for cause such as breach 
of contract." DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; 50,000 EXPECTED AT ANNUAL FIESTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For one day, the city's population will almost double as downtown streets 
swell with visitors celebrating the seventh annual San Clemente Fiesta Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 50,000 people are expected to pack two downtown blocks on Avenida 
del Mar to enjoy special events such as a 5K run and the annual Salsa 
Challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 For those with competitive spirits and big appetites, separate contests will 
be held to determine who can eat the most pickles, pies and watermelon. Other 
competitions will be held to discover who is the best at Hula-Hoop and tortilla 
tossing. 
</P>
<P>
 Called the Fiesta 5000 Run/Stride/Walk, the 5K run will start at 8 a.m., 
although day-of-event sign-up will begin two hours earlier. Leisurely 
competitors and serious runners alike will run through the scenic hills and 
streets of San Clemente. Most contestants are expected to be finished by 10 
a.m., and an awards ceremony will take place at that time at Avenida del Mar 
and El Camino Real. 
</P>
<P>
 The street fair will be 9 a.m. to 7 p.m., with live bands and shows.  
</P>
<P>
 Past featured performers have included Rita Coolidge and the Coasters. This 
year's main act will be the Fabulous Jetsons Rocket-Roll show. 
</P>
<P>
 Food and game booths will line Avenida del Mar, many of them staffed by 
community groups that use the proceeds for charity work. 
</P>
<P>
 For salsa lovers, tasting for the competition will start at 11 a.m. Visitors 
can take a free shuttle that will leave from San Clemente High School.  
</P>
<P>
 Several streets will be closed starting at 6 a.m., including El Camino Real 
from Avenida Valencia to El Portal; West Portal and side streets bordering Max 
Berg Plaza Park. Avenida del Mar will be closed between El Camino Real and 
Calle Seville.FRANK MESSINA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; YOUTHS TO PLAY BALL ON IMPROVED FIELDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN FRANEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Come spring, the days of patching up gopher holes and fighting a faulty 
irrigation system will be over for parents of ballplayers in Rancho Niguel 
Little League. 
</P>
<P>
 New sod outfields and improved irrigation are just two of the changes slated 
for the Crown Valley Elementary School ball fields after the City Council this 
week approved spending about $300,000 for the improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rancho Niguel Little League people have been very patient with playing on 
substandard fields," Councilman Mark Goodman said before the unanimous vote. 
"We should go full speed ahead and finish this project." 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of the money for the improvements will come from a development 
agreement reached with Monarch Bay Resorts last year. That settlement money has 
gone toward various athletic field improvements, including the $1.3 million 
used to upgrade Chapparosa Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The city had originally set aside $232,000 for the Crown Valley Elementary 
field improvements. When the design firm's estimate came in at more than 
$311,000, city staff recommended postponing several improvements to bring the 
project within the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 But the council agreed to keep all parts of the development plan rather than 
bring down the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 The project will include reorienting the fields so both back up against the 
restrooms and concession stands. The larger field, which is used by the Major 
division, will be extended so that the outfield fence is almost the regulation 
distance of 200 feet from home plate. 
</P>
<P>
 The project also includes new bleachers, picnic tables, a batting cage, 
parking for the disabled, trees and wiring for lights. 
</P>
<P>
 The project must still be approved formally by the Capistrano Unified School 
District, although the district already has given preliminary agreement to the 
improvements if the city paid for them. 
</P>
<P>
 The city expects the project to be completed by February, 1995, in time for 
the new Little League season. LYNN FRANEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; PIONEER PARK BEING GIVEN A NEW LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After years of being a gathering place for the homeless and gang members, 
Pioneer Park is undergoing a rebirth. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction is in full swing to convert the four-acre parcel on Chapman 
Avenue from a woodsy, day-camp type of park to a facility that offers more 
varied activities, including roller hockey. 
</P>
<P>
 Funded by state park bond money, the $400,000 project includes installing new 
concrete walks, picnic tables, restrooms, landscaping and lights. The 
centerpiece is a lighted roller hockey rink with bleachers for spectators. 
</P>
<P>
 The spruced-up park is expected to reopen in November, according to Community 
Services Director Michael Fenderson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was originally designed for picnics, and (for people) to get away from the 
hustle and bustle of life," Fenderson said. "We cannot afford that anymore. The 
park has to have more uses." 
</P>
<P>
 He said residents have complained that the park, with its tall trees and wide 
grassy areas, was becoming a haven for the homeless and a hangout for gang 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 "People were afraid to go there," Fenderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Vega, 10, who lives near the park, said his mother prohibited him from 
playing there. On his way to school, he would walk far out of his way just to 
avoid the park, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 One time, he said, he and his friends were confronted by a drunk who threw 
empty beer bottles at them. 
</P>
<P>
 The refurbished park "will be great," he said. "I have a hockey stick and my 
brother has a roller blade. It will be fun."BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; MAN ARRESTED IN INVESTMENT SCHEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Irvine man has been arrested for allegedly pocketing $83,000 that a 
neighbor gave him to invest in mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Friday that they are investigating whether John Harvey Rhynerson, 
40, bilked as many as 10 victims out of more than $200,000 that he said he was 
investing. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine police and U.S. postal inspectors arrested Rhynerson at his Irvine home 
Thursday on suspicion of grand theft. He was arraigned Friday and released on 
his own recognizance. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that Rhynerson took the $83,000 from a neighbor in 1992, saying he 
was investing the money in high-yielding mutual funds. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, Rhynerson sent the neighbor investment statements and provided 
him with occasional interest payments, said Police Sgt. Dwight Henninger. 
</P>
<P>
 When the payments stopped, the neighbor became suspicious and confronted 
Rhynerson, who could not account for the money, Henninger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe there were other victims of the scam because Rhynerson told his 
neighbor that the $83,000 would be placed in a larger investment pool.SHELBY

GLENDALE TURNS ON THE GAS FROM LANDFILL TO POWER HOMES; WASTE: EXPERTS SAY 
METHANE-TO-ENERGY SYSTEMS HELP THE ENVIRONMENT AND CAN GENERATE A PROFIT FOR 
AGENCIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the turn of a valve Friday, gas created by garbage rotting at a local 
landfill was used to generate enough electricity for 30,000 homes in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounds like an environmentalist's dream, but the process is becoming a 
reality for municipalities across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight such systems are being used at landfills and power plants throughout Los 
Angeles County, according to sanitation officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's landfill system is on the verge of a crisis as the capacity to 
hold solid waste diminishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Diverting landfill gas toward power plants will do little to improve the 
condition of dumping grounds, officials with the Sanitary Districts of Los 
Angeles County say. But many agree that gas-to-energy systems are good for the 
environment and can sometimes generate a profit for participating agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a win-win-win all the way around," John Cosulich, a supervising engineer 
with the sanitation agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Methane and carbon dioxide gas naturally emitted by decomposing trash at the 
Scholl Canyon Landfill is collected, treated, compressed and dehydrated with 
equipment at the site of the $10-million project in Glendale. It is transported 
to the city's power plant 5 1/2 miles away through an underground pipeline. 
</P>
<P>
 When it reaches the Grayson Power Plant, the gas is blended with more methane 
and used to fuel the boilers that produce electrical power. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Glendale Mayor Eileen Givens smashed a champagne bottle against an 
above-ground portion of the pipeline and turned a large valve that ushered the 
landfill gas into the power plant. "We come together to publicly dedicate this 
pipeline," she said Friday. "My city colleagues would want me to say, 'It's 
been a real gas.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually everyone involved with the project -- city officials, the developer, 
homeowners and officials with the Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County -- 
expects to benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 Over 20 years, Glendale officials anticipate revenues and savings of $40 
million stemming partly from less money spent on gas needed to operate the 
power plant. 
</P>
<P>
 The project's developer, Palmer Capital Corp. of Massachusetts, will sell the 
treated gas to the city for at least $330,000 a month, a discount of 12.5% from 
what the city spent for natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Scholl Canyon Landfill collects about 2,000 tons of garbage a day from 
Glendale, Pasadena, Sierra Madre, San Marino and unincorporated parts of Los 
Angeles County.

AL MARTINEZ: MICHAEL THE CAT RETURNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As quality goes, it's no "Forrest Gump." And yet it has all the elements that 
make most movies successful: death, beauty, cops, sex, danger, nudity, 
insanity, bad language and enough cliches to choke a poet. But most of all it 
has Michael the Cat. 
</P>
<P>
 The film is called "The Dying Game" and stars no one you've ever heard of. It 
was sent to me on videotape by the aforementioned Michael the Cat, so called 
because he once made his living as a cat burglar. His real name is Michael 
Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
 He is one of thousands of people in L.A. who want to become Steven Spielberg 
or Oliver Stone. The town is full of those who believe God is tapping them on 
the shoulder and whispering, "Roll 'em." Michael, of course, was hoping I would 
review the movie, which he produced, and enclosed a packet of microwave popcorn 
with the tape. Small bribes are all I'm accustomed to, so I ate the popcorn and 
watched "The Dying Game." Let me say first that it isn't unusual for a former 
burglar to become an instant film producer. The last movie I wrote about was 
produced by an unfrocked minister, and the one before that by a man who owned 
an apartment building for nudists in Downtown L.A. It takes all kinds. 
</P>
<P>
 Their efforts fall into the category of works created by people who know 
nothing about filmmaking and who have to sell their souls to scrape together 
enough money to rent a camera. Some souls bring in a little more than others so 
the quality varies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I met Michael after he served eight months for burglary. He used to dress in a 
tuxedo and walk his Doberman through Beverly Hills at night. Everyone assumed 
he was the kid next door, just home from a prom and out taking his prize Dobie 
for a walk. Michael was a sweet-faced 19 at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 What the neighbors didn't know was that he was casing the area for later 
burglaries and the dog was his trained lookout. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was long ago, Michael the Cat purred the other day. Now he's a 
filmmaker, an ambition he acquired when he read that foreigners were dying to 
see American movies. If there was money to be made, he was all for making it. 
The work didn't seem that hard, and was safer than sneaking into houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Orson Welles once said that everything you needed to know about filmmaking you 
could learn in three days. Then he made "Citizen Kane." Michael took a course 
that lasted 16 hours and made "The Dying Game." 
</P>
<P>
 There's a saying in show biz, "Don't quit your day job." Michael, now 36 and 
still sweet-faced, works at night as a tour director for rich British visitors, 
so he didn't have to. He could shoot his movie during the day, while making a 
real living after dark. He always has liked night work. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanging onto his soul, he raised money by borrowing on his credit cards, by 
accepting donations and by pledging his life savings. The movie cost $120,000, 
and has already returned $57,000 in sales to companies in India, South Africa 
and Stara Zagora, Bulgaria. 
</P>
<P>
 Giddy with success, Michael is planning that his next movie will star 
Angelyne, the bosomy, pucker-lipped baby doll whose posters are all over town. 
I'm not sure what she does beside appear on posters, but does it matter? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Dying Game" is about a serial killer who terrorizes a sorority house. Michael 
the Cat, in a reversal of roles, plays the cop on the case. Every time the 
killer strikes, he whispers, "Goodby, Gamma Phi," which is the name of the 
sorority. 
</P>
<P>
 Since no one will ever see this movie in America, I'm tempted to reveal the 
name of the killer, but I won't. It ties in with his farewell to Gamma Phi. I 
will say, however, keep an eye on nice old ladies who offer you milk and pie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Game" is filled with nubile young women who strut their sexuality awkwardly 
across the screen. Michael the Cop takes it all in stride. "I just love 
policemen," a half-naked sorority woman says. "Don't leave town," Michael 
replies grimly. 
</P>
<P>
 I write about movies so I can use all of a critic's cliches: It was a 
roller-coaster ride, it wasn't mean-spirited, it was a feel-good movie. While 
"Dying Game" wasn't exactly a ride and didn't leave me feeling any better than 
before, it wasn't mean-spirited. It wasn't fun either, but the Cat isn't in it 
for fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Put this in your ads, Michael. "Game" is better than a lot of the movies I 
see, and I hope it gets top billing in Stara Zagora. Good luck, don't quit your 
night job . . . and goodby, Gamma Phi.

2 PROMINENT LAWYERS HIRED FOR SIMPSON CHILDREN; INVESTIGATION: EDI M.O. FAAL 
AND CARL JONES HAVE AGREED TO REPRESENT THE MURDER SUSPECT'S TWO ADULT 
OFFSPRING. POLICE AND PROSECUTORS ARE SEEKING TO INTERVIEW THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Two respected Southern California attorneys are signing up to play a role in 
the O.J. Simpson murder case, though they will not join his already crowded 
defense team, sources close to the case said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Edi M.O. Faal and Carl Jones have agreed to represent Simpson's two adult 
children, Arnelle and Jason Simpson, the sources said. Police and prosecutors 
are seeking to interview the two children, and Simpson's attorneys want them to 
have legal representation before they grant those interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 If the children decline to be interviewed voluntarily, authorities have hinted 
that they might serve them with subpoenas and force them to testify before a 
grand jury, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones is a Pasadena attorney and founder of a highly acclaimed private 
organization dedicated to providing indigent defendants quality legal 
representation at a lower cost to taxpayers. He declined to comment on his 
involvement in the Simpson case Friday. But sources in the defense camp said he 
has been asked to represent Jason Simpson, O.J. Simpson's oldest son. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Faal, who attracted national attention last year with his much-acclaimed 
defense of Damian Monroe Williams, signed on Thursday night to represent 
Arnelle Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is a witness in this case," Faal said Friday. "She needs someone to guide 
her through that process." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Faal nor Jones will be part of the defense team itself, which includes 
at least nine attorneys, including several nationally known lawyers. Lead 
attorney Robert L. Shapiro has said that he has completed his search for legal 
talent to join that team. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnelle and Jason Simpson had been represented by Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., but 
Cochran joined the defense team last month, creating a possible conflict if he 
continued to represent the children, particularly if they are called as 
witnesses in their father's trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnelle Simpson's statements could be of particular interest to authorities, 
as she was at her father's home on the night of the murders and spoke to the 
police officers who came onto the property without a warrant the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Faal declined to speculate on what authorities want to discuss with Arnelle 
Simpson, but stressed that nothing in her account will help prosecutors seeking 
to win a conviction against her father. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously not," Faal said. "Johnnie Cochran just wanted to be careful, to be 
sure that there was no possible conflict, so he asked me to consider 
representing Arnelle." 
</P>
<P>
 During last month's preliminary hearing, Arnelle Simpson was called to the 
witness stand by her father's attorneys and asked about her conversations with 
police officers on the morning after the killings. In her testimony, she said 
she had never given police permission to seize anything from the premises and 
added that no officer had indicated to her any concern about her safety or that 
of other residents at Simpson's estate. 
</P>
<P>
 That testimony was offered to show that police did not jump the fence and 
enter Simpson's estate out of concern for people inside, as the detectives 
stated in their testimony. Although the officers' decision to enter the 
property without a warrant was approved by Municipal Judge Kathleen 
Kennedy-Powell, Simpson's attorneys are expected to raise the issue again as 
part of their renewed attempt to have the search declared invalid. 
</P>
<P>
 In other developments Friday: 
</P>
<P>
 * There was a flurry of court activity -- all of it under seal. Simpson's 
defense lawyers filed two sealed motions. Court officials said one was a 
response to an earlier motion by the prosecution. The other defense motion was 
an ex parte application -- a request to the judge for some action. For his 
part, Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito issued an order under seal. 
</P>
<P>
 * Law enforcement sources said police have a receipt from a Burbank costume 
shop where Simpson allegedly purchased a wig and mustache about a month before 
the murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman. The sources said 
police have not established whether those items have any significance to the 
case.

KNBC BACKS DOWN OVER RIGHTS TO VIDEO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fight over who has the right to broadcast a videotape showing a Compton 
officer beating a youth took another bizarre twist Friday, with KNBC Channel 4 
backing down from its hard-line stance that it had exclusive rights to the 
tape. 
</P>
<P>
 KNBC's reversal was met with delight from several of its television rivals, 
who said the station wound up eating crow with its unusual action. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days ago, the station threatened to sue any news organization that used 
the videotape. It said it had paid $125 for exclusive worldwide rights for the 
tape to Maria Quintana, the mother of Felipe Soltero, the youth who was struck 
by the officer in the video. The threats were criticized by other television 
stations, whose officials said it went against the common practice of sharing 
exclusive material after it is aired. 
</P>
<P>
 However, KNBC was forced to back down Friday when an attorney informed the 
station that Quintana was not the legal owner of the tape, and that the video 
actually belonged to Libidia Vasquez, a neighbor of Quintana's. Attorney Jim 
Blancarte, who represents Vasquez, said Quintana did not have any right to sell 
the video, shot by Vasquez's 17-year-old son, to KNBC. 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez had sold the tape to Quintana for $60 with the understanding that she 
would only show it to police to get her son released from jail, Blancarte said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that KNBC not only could not prohibit other organizations from 
showing the tape, but would have to purchase rights from Vasquez if it wanted 
to show the tape. He said he and Vasquez were considering several offers from 
organizations wishing to purchase non-exclusive rights to the video. 
</P>
<P>
 A KNBC representative said Friday that the station "stands by its position 
that it has the right" to broadcast the beating tape. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mark Hoffman, vice president of news, said in a statement, "In view of the 
enormous attention and interest the Compton beating story has generated, NBC 
has decided not to assert any rights or claims of exclusivity from this point 
forward against any media outlet that obtains rights to distribute the tape." 
</P>
<P>
 Blancarte said that possible legal action against KNBC might be taken if it 
continues to show the video: "Without a valid grant of rights, they will be 
accruing damages on an ongoing basis with each broadcast of the tape." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the CBS network and KCBS Channel 2 have purchased non-exclusive 
rights to the video, Blancarte said. He declined to confirm the reported 
$10,000 price, but said the fee is considerably more than NBC paid Quintana.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; INMATE ESCAPES LOW-SECURITY JAIL 
</P>

 An orange jumpsuit dropped near a trash bin was the only clue left by an 
inmate who escaped Friday morning from the James A. Musick Branch Jail, said a 
spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerdardo Herber Solis, 22, apparently escaped from the low-security Irvine 
jail by climbing over a barbed-wire fence soon after breakfast, said Lt. Dan 
Martini. 
</P>
<P>
 Solis, a Costa Mesa resident who also goes by the name Walter Vasquez, was 
being held at the jail while waiting trial on a charge of possessing a stolen 
vehicle, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prisoner was found to be missing at the 7 a.m. inmate count. Solis' jail 
jumpsuit was found next to the bin outside the jail mess hall. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, authorities feared that Solis might have climbed into the bin that 
is trucked about two miles to the Frank R. Bowerman landfill on Sand Canyon 
Road in Irvine, and that he may have been buried in trash at the landfill, 
Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 But after two Sheriff's Department bloodhounds at the landfill were unable to 
pick up the inmate's scent, he said, investigators concluded it was more likely 
that Solis had simply climbed over the jail's fence. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is now a fugitive, and we are actively looking for him," Martini said.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; SCHOOLS TO OFFER FREE, REDUCED-PRICE MEALS 
</P>

 Many Garden Grove Unified School District students may be eligible for free or 
reduced-price meals under the National School Lunch and Breakfast programs, a 
spokesman said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Applications for the program, which is run by the U.S. Department of 
Agriculture, will be distributed to all students next month, district spokesman 
Alan Trudell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students may be eligible based on the number of people in their household and 
their family's income. For example, children in a household of four would be 
eligible for free meals if the family earned less than $19,240 a year. The same 
children would be eligible for reduced-price meals if the family's annual 
income is between $19,240 and $27,380. 
</P>
<P>
 Children from households that receive food stamps or Aid to Families With 
Dependent Children are automatically eligible. Their applications must include 
the names of all eligible children, the food stamp or AFDC case number and the 
name and signature of an adult in the home, Trudell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of regular-price meals for other students remains unchanged for the 
14th straight year. A basic lunch costs 75 cents for elementary school 
students, 80 cents for intermediate school students and $1 for those in high 
school. Those prices are the lowest in the county, Trudell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district serves most of Garden Grove, and parts of Santa Ana, 
Anaheim, Westminster, Cypress, Stanton and Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information about the reduced-price and free meals, parents may call 
the district's food services office at (714) 663-6155. JON NALICK

 A 16-year-old boy was wounded Thursday night in a gang-related shooting, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy, not identified because of his age, was listed in critical condition 
Friday at an undisclosed hospital, Orange police Sgt. Barry Weinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, described by police as an Anaheim gang member, was in a car 
stopped at Katella Avenue and Glassell Street at 9:30 p.m. when two youths 
thought to be rivals pulled alongside in a pickup truck. The truck's driver 
asked the four occupants of the car where they were from and then fired a 
handgun, Weinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, riding in the back seat, was hit in the upper body. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman drove off in the pickup, which was described as a dark blue Nissan 
with its tailgate and rear bumper missing, Weinstein said. KEN ELLINGWOOD

 Hoping to make the dropping off of children at Moulton Elementary School 
easier for parents, the City Council this week approved eliminating parking on 
the east side of Highlands Avenue just north of the school entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 A loading zone will be created along Highlands for 150 feet north of the 
entrance.Members of the Police Auxiliary Citizens Team, who help with traffic 
control at schools, had suggested the change and said parents had to zigzag 
around parked cars to find enough curb space to drop off children. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the creation of the loading zone, "No U-turn" signs will be posted 
on Highlands in front of the school. Although U-turns there are legal, city 
staff said the U-turns caused congestion and posed a safety hazard. LYNN FRANEY

2 INJURED IN WRECK THAT SNARLS TRAFFIC FOR HOURS

 Two people were injured and thousands of rush-hour commuters were delayed 
Friday when a car traveling north on the Corona del Mar Freeway crossed the 
center divider and collided with two southbound vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash closed all southbound lanes of the freeway at MacArthur Boulevard 
for nearly two hours following the 4:50 p.m. wreck, according to the California 
Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the injured was taken to a hospital by helicopter, but his condition 
was not known. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said a teen-ager driving a luxury car went onto an embankment before 
crossing the center divider and colliding with the other vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of one of the southbound vehicles had to be cut out of a pickup 
truck before he could be taken to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana with cuts, 
broken bones and possible internal injuries, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-age driver was taken to the same hospital with neck and back 
injuries, said Orange County Fire Department Capt. Philip W. Connolly. No one 
was injured in the second southbound vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no passengers in either the Mercedes or the pickup, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash closed the southbound lanes of the freeway from MacArthur to 
Jamboree Road and backed up traffic for miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Units from Orange County and Costa Mesa fire departments and the Newport Beach 
Police Department assisted the CHP. Authorities would not release the names of 
the injured motorists.

EPISCOPAL BISHOPS' PANEL COMPLETES STUDY ON GAY ISSUES; POLICY: FINDINGS 
ACKNOWLEDGE CURRENT BAN ON ORDAINING NON-CELIBATE HOMOSEXUALS. HOUSE OF BISHOPS 
WILL CONSIDER MATTER THIS MONTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY B. STAMMER, TIMES RELIGION WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Should the Episcopal Church bless committed and monogamous same-sex unions? 
Should the church ordain non-celibate gay men and lesbians to the priesthood? 
</P>
<P>
 After three years of intensive behind-the-scenes study, a committee of the 
nation's Episcopal bishops has completed a proposed pastoral teaching on human 
sexuality that is likely to leave neither liberals nor conservatives satisfied. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue -- one that has confronted the American Baptist Churches, United 
Methodist Church, Presbyterian Church (USA) and the Evangelical Lutheran Church 
in America, among others -- is expected to come to a head Aug. 24 when the 
church's House of Bishops convenes in Indianapolis for the denomination's 
triennial General Convention -- the highest policy-making body of the church. 
The bishops are scheduled to vote on whether to make the draft a pastoral 
teaching, which would guide the denomination's 2.5 million members. 
</P>
<P>
 On one hand, the draft acknowledges the current ban on ordaining non-celibate 
gays and lesbians, and upholds heterosexual marriage as the church's historic 
standard. As in the Roman Catholic Church, homosexual orientation in itself has 
not been a bar to ordination. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, however, the draft proposes eight guidelines for continuing 
the sometimes wrenching dialogue that could someday lead to a change in the 
Episcopal Church's position on homosexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no common mind in this church, theologically or practically 
speaking, on homosexuality," said a member of the drafting committee, the Rt. 
Rev. Richard L. Shimpfky, bishop of the Diocese of El Camino Real, which 
includes San Jose and Monterey. 
</P>
<P>
 To liberals, especially gay and lesbian advocates, the guidelines fail to go 
far enough in honoring committed same-sex relationships and affirming the gifts 
that non-celibate gays and lesbians can bring to the priesthood. 
</P>
<P>
 To conservatives, the draft softens the church's traditional teaching that 
sexual morality means absolute faithfulness in marriage and sexual abstinence 
apart from marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, for example, 18 bishops from Province VII of the church -- which 
includes Arkansas, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Texas, Kansas and parts of Missouri 
and Louisiana -- warned that the guidelines "would signal a substantive change" 
in the church's teaching. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The charge is denied by the Rt. Rev. Richard F. Grein, Bishop of New York City 
and chairman of the drafting committee. "This pastoral teaching is not intended 
to offer a particular solution or some new unusual perspective on the issues, 
nor have we changed the present teaching of this church on any of these 
issues," Grein wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, anticipating what could be a contentious debate, the bishops 
stress that as vexing as sexual issues can be, they do not touch on the 
doctrinal core of Christian faith and belief and should not be allowed to 
disrupt the unity of the Episcopal Church, the U.S. branch of the worldwide 
Anglican Communion. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines reflect the bishops' dilemma.  
</P>
<P>
 The first guideline acknowledges a 1979 policy that says the church will only 
ordain those who, among other qualifications, can be a "wholesome example to 
all people." In essence the earlier policy allows the ordination as deacons, 
priests and bishops of celibate gays and lesbians who are otherwise qualified. 
</P>
<P>
 The question then arises over whether a non-celibate gay or lesbian can be a 
wholesome example. To some bishops the answer is yes. To others the answer is 
clearly no. It is up to the local bishop and his or her local Commission on 
Ministry to decide.  
</P>
<P>
 Thus, a liberal bishop like the Rt. Rev. Shelby Spong of Newark, N.J. has 
ordained non-celibate gays and lesbians, while other bishops steadfastly 
refuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who defines 'wholesome' -- that's what we're dealing with," Shimpfky said. 
"Historically it has always been the bishop and people of the diocese that have 
made that determination. But now . . . there are a lot of people who are saying 
they don't like that. They want what's wholesome in Iowa to be what's 
applicable in New York City. That becomes a flash point." 
</P>
<P>
 The only major denomination with a clear policy permitting the ordination of 
non-celibate gays and lesbians is the United Church of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 The second issue involves whether to bless same-gender unions. The term 
marriage is never used. 
</P>
<P>
 In its proposed guidelines, the bishops committee appears to hedge the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 First it says it recognizes that the New Testament standard is a lifelong, 
monogamous, heterosexual union.  
</P>
<P>
 But four paragraphs later, the draft substitutes the words "mature adults" for 
man and woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe sexual relationships reach their fullest potential for good and 
minimize their capacity for ill when in the context of chaste, faithful, and 
committed lifelong unions between mature adults. There are those who believe 
this is as true for homosexual as for heterosexual relationships and that such 
relationships need and should receive the pastoral care of the church," the 
draft declares. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rt. Rev. Chester Talton, Suffragan (assistant) bishop of the Los Angeles 
Episcopal Diocese, said the draft teaching is trying to face reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pastoral attempts to lift up before the whole church that different 
things are happening in different parts of the church," Talton said. "I don't 
think the pastoral attempts to say that the teaching of the church is changed. 
It's just to acknowledge that the way we are living together as the church is 
evolving and changing and expressing itself in different ways and different 
places." 
</P>
<P>
 Episcopal priests in the Los Angeles diocese are divided. The Rev. George 
Regas, rector of All Saints Episcopal Church in Pasadena, caused a furor among 
some priests when he began blessing same-sex unions in 1992. That same year, 
Rabbi Allen I. Freehling of University Synagogue in Los Angeles, a Reform 
congregation, performed what he called a same-sex marriage of two men. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the guidelines make any difference to bishops and local parishioners? Jim 
Solheim, a church spokesman at national headquarters in New York, thinks it may 
to those in the middle. 
</P>
<P>
 "For those on the far right who in sweeping gestures dismiss the whole process 
it obviously is not going to make any difference at all," Solheim said. "For 
the liberal bishops who have already made up their minds it's going to mean 
absolutely nothing. But when you lop off the right and lop off the left, you 
have a central core of bishops who take the process seriously and would like 
the church to wrestle with this until they come to some kind of agreement." 
Findings Include Guide on Sexuality 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of the guidelines the Episcopal bishops committee on sexuality 
is recommending: 
</P>
<P>
 * "While our sexuality is a very important part of who we are. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * "The standard found in the New Testament of lifelong, monogamous, 
heterosexual union as the setting intended by God for sexual relationships . . 
. is the foundation on which the church's traditional teaching is built. 
</P>
<P>
 * "We continue in study and dialogue, seeking to reconcile, to the extent 
possible, discontinuities which may exist in . . . human sexuality between 
Scripture, tradition and informed reason on the one hand, and our human 
experience on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 * "It is necessary for the church to articulate appropriate moral and ethical 
guidelines for homosexual as well as heterosexual Christians. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Sexual relationships reach their fullest potential for good . . . in the 
context of chaste, faithful and committed lifelong unions between mature 
adults. There are those who believe this is as true for homosexual as for 
heterosexual relationships. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * "We view as . . . morally unacceptable sexual behavior which is adulterous, 
promiscuous, abusive or exploitative in nature, or which involves children or 
others incapable of informed, mutual consent and understanding. . . . "

greatly appreciate it, of course.There was, however, one inadvertent 
inaccuracy. The Jewish L.A. tour was correctly attributed to the University of 
Judaism, the event's sponsor, but is not one of the university's regular 
monthly tours. The guided visit to old neighborhoods is offered monthly by the 
Jewish Historical Society. Periodic jointly sponsored programs, such as the one 
described, are a part of the year-round educational tour program offered by the 
university's continuing education department.

 Commissioner Peter H. Chang has been appointed territorial commander of the 
Salvation Army for 13 Western states, succeeding Paul A. Rader, the newly 
elected general of the global evangelistic and social service denomination. 
</P>
<P>
 The Korean-born Chang, 60, has been the Salvation Army's territorial commander 
in South Korea since 1991, but before that was stationed for a few years at the 
Western territory headquarters in Rancho Palos Verdes as training principal in 
the officers' school. 
</P>
<P>
 Rader, elected general of the Salvation Army July 23 in London, had been a 
missionary in South Korea from 1962 to 1984, except for two years' doctoral 
study at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rader picked Chang to succeed him, I think, because the general believes he 
will maintain the growth plan for this decade," said Robert Docter of 
Northridge, editor of the Western territory newspaper New Frontiers. Rader 
established Western territorial goals that included the aim to double its 1990 
total of nearly 200 congregations by the year 2000. "We have a little more than 
230 right now," Docter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chang, a third-generation Salvation Army officer, has served a number of posts 
in the United States, the South Pacific and East Asia. He earned master's 
degrees from Union Theological Seminary and Columbia University in New York 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 Rader, also 60, will depart the Los Angeles area for his new duties in late 
August. Chang's appointment becomes effective Sept. 1.

 Violent anti-abortion protests, the future of the Southern Baptist Convention 
and a look back at the ill-fated Branch Davidian sect in Waco are among topics 
to be discussed today in the closing sessions of the Assn. for Sociology of 
Religion in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-day meeting of scholars who study the behavior of religious groups,

assailant shot and killed two people at an abortion clinic on July 28. 
</P>
<P>
 A panel of speakers will discuss at 10:30 a.m. what lies ahead for Southern 
Baptists, whose conservative leadership has solidified its authority after 
years of political and theological disputes. The panelists will include the 
Rev. Richard Land, executive director of the Southern Baptists' Christian Life 
Commission, and Kirk Hadaway, a researcher with the United Church of Christ. 
</P>
<P>

 Of the more than 1,600 Southern Baptist churches and missions in California, 
Saddleback Valley Community Church in Mission Viejo and Immanuel Baptist Church 
in San Bernardino County usually are among the leaders in contributions to the 
denomination's various mission programs. For the first six months of 1994, 
according to reports from the denomination's state headquarters in Fresno, 
Saddleback Valley, pastored by the Rev. Rick Warren, was tops in California 
with $108,244, and Immanuel Baptist, where the Rev. Rob Zinn is pastor, was a 
close second with $107,127. The third highest total through June was $69,017 
from Magnolia Avenue Baptist Church in Riverside. 
</P>
<P>
 In per capita giving totals, the smaller churches rank highest. Paradise Hills 
Southern Baptist in San Diego, the Rev. Aaron Eurich, pastor, was first with 
$245.59 from with an average 50 people at worship services. BOOK

EXPRESSION OF EMPATHY IN MARATHON DISPUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a retired pastor of a Japanese American Christian church, we felt a great 
empathy for the Korean pastors who are urging the organizers of the L.A. 
Marathon to consider the possibility of a change of the annual event to another 
day ("Korean Pastors Say L.A. Marathon Keeps Worshipers Away," July 30). To 
those who faithfully look forward to the weekly worship experience with other 
believers, even the thought of not being able to attend church on one Sunday is 
deeply felt. We realize that we are speaking about a small percentage of 
congregations which are affected on this Sunday, but the Korean pastors are 
speaking for a great number of congregations in the inner city which are 
directly affected by the marathon.

REACTING TO STATEMENT BY PRESIDENT OF EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My years of trying to be a Christian flew out the window after I read the 
statements attributed to William Burke, president of the L.A. Marathon.How dare 
he defame the work of ministers and churches by implying that the Korean 
pastors' concern for the economic well-being of their churches is somehow 
sinister. Does Burke know of anything that gets along without money? Our faith 
teaches that Christians are to worship God publicly and weekly and give their 
titles weekly. Burke's efforts to obstruct that by not heeding the concerns of 
those churches affected by the marathon is serious business.

 The Koreans ask for an apology from Mr. Burke. I'm not sure I would go that

why Christian people gather together. It is not an option. It is what provides 
strength and focus.

STUDENT'S LAWSUIT CLAIMS TEACHER PUSHED HIM DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Trabuco Hills High School student sued the Saddleback Valley Unified School 
District on Friday and accused a teacher of pushing him against a cabinet and 
wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Michael Keefer and his guardian, Kathleen Delano, are seeking 
unspecified damages against the school district.The teacher as well as the 
school's principal are listed as co-defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Keefer claims that in January, the teacher approached him while in a classroom 
and demanded that he turn over a pair of dice. When Keefer said he didn't have 
any dice, the teacher pushed him against a cabinet and counter, causing the 
student to fall to the floor, according to the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The teacher also pulled Keefer's hair and demanded that he empty his pockets, 
the lawsuit stated. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials could not reached for comment Friday evening.

ATTORNEY SAYS SLAIN SUSPECT WAS NOT ARMED; CRIME: A LAWYER KNOWN FOR PURSUING 
BRUTALITY CASES IS REPRESENTING RELATIVES OF A MAN KILLED BY COSTA MESA POLICE. 
HE DISPUTES INVESTIGATORS' STATEMENTS THAT THE MAN FIRED FIRST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A lawyer representing relatives of the suspect shot dead by Costa Mesa police 
near a bank this week said Friday the man was not armed and could not have 
fired first, as investigators have said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The information we've gathered so far indicates he was not armed at the time 
he was shot," said Los Angeles attorney Stephen Yagman, who is known for 
pursuing brutality cases. "The man did not possess a gun at the time of the 
shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 Yagman accused police of planting a "throwaway" handgun at the scene. He 
declined to specify evidence for his charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators probing the shooting of John R. Mazak, 48, of Mission Viejo have 
said police were returning fire when Mazak fell in a hail of gunfire in a 
parking lot near the Bank of Yorba Linda on Adams Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, homicide investigators in the Orange County district attorney's 
office declined to discuss Yagman's charges or other aspects of the incident. 
But they stuck with their account that Mazak shot first, after a brief police 
chase through a nearby health club. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the investigation is over, we'll have something to talk about," said 
Supervising Deputy District Atty. Christopher J. Evans. 
</P>
<P>
 The chase began when bank employees spotted Mazak outside and told police that 
they recognized him as the man who held up the bank with a gun in April. Mazak, 
a free-lance paralegal, served six years in federal prison in the 1980s after 
being convicted in New Mexico of armed bank robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Yagman, saying Mazak's family is "shaken and bereaved," said he planned to 
file suit in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles next week, charging Costa Mesa 
police with violating the civil rights of Mazak and his family by using 
excessive force. 
</P>
<P>
 Yagman, a controversial figure who said he has sued every law-enforcement 
agency in Orange County, has won high-profile cases in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the U.S. Supreme Court let stand a decision that Newport Beach police 
used excessive force when they handcuffed a drunk-driving suspect to a hospital 
chair and allegedly held him by the shoulders while a nurse drew blood. Last 
year, Yagman won $285,000 in damages from the city on behalf of an advertising 
executive beaten during a 1986 traffic arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 He was recently barred from practicing in Los Angeles federal court for 
criticizing a judge, but a federal appeals court blocked that order at the last 
minute.

POLICE SEARCH FOR MISSING SECURITY GUARD; LAW ENFORCEMENT: SANTA ANA MAN, 32, 
HASN'T BEEN SEEN SINCE JULY 26. THREE TEEN-AGERS WHO WERE DRIVING HIS RENTED 
CAR ARE STOPPED AND QUESTIONED BUT ARE RELEASED.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Police are asking for help in locating a private security guard reported 
missing by his family since July 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Jerome Williams, 32, left his home in the 3700 block of South Van Ness 
Street 10 days ago to pick up uniforms and has not returned or contacted his 
family, said Santa Ana Police Sgt. Dick Faust. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Friday Faust said, Anaheim police stopped three teen-agers driving 
Williams' rented, 1991 Ford Taurus. The teen-agers were questioned and denied 
knowing Williams and were released, Faust said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who worked in Santa Ana, is African American, about 5-feet-8 and 170 
pounds, Faust said. He is missing two front teeth. He has brown eyes and short 
hair, and was last seen wearing a white T-shirt. Williams has no known medical 
or mental problems. Anyone with information regarding his whereabouts is asked 
to contact Santa Ana police at (714) 834-4801, or Investigator B. Rodriguez.

HOLD YOUR BREATH -- IS THERE HOPE?; SERB CONCESSION; NATO STRIKE IN BOSNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is almost impossible to wax optimistic about Bosnia-Herzegovina without 
running the risk of seeming foolish or at least naive. After all, the world has 
seen other major "turning points" in this crisis before. The most memorable, 
perhaps, was the once-heralded and now almost wholly forgotten London 
agreement. This 1992 deal, agreed to by all the parties, was supposed to 
deliver every party's heavy weapons into U.N. hands and serve as the 
comprehensive settlement of the conflict. And look what has happened since. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, there can be no denying that if Belgrade does cut off its support for 
its fellow Serb warriors in Bosnia-Herzegovina, that would be a potentially 
pivotal development. And there can be no denying the apparent and immediate 
impact of the NATO air strike Friday against Serb military positions still 
within the so-called total exclusion zone around Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 MAKING THE POINT: Established by U.N. Security Council resolutions, the 
exclusion zone was violated earlier this week by Bosnian Serb forces. Now, with 
air strikes ordered by Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, the U.N. commander, the Serbs 
have experienced a Western reaction that will surely get their attention. All 
the evidence since the failed London agreement suggests that the Serbs are 
oblivious to all factors, whether moral, ethical or their own public promises, 
except for force. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, in the aftermath of the bombing action, the Bosnian Serbs reportedly 
told the United Nations they will immediately return all weapons taken from a 
U.N. collection depot near Sarajevo -- the immediate provocation for the NATO 
retaliation. If they do as they say, this will be further proof of what many of 
us have been saying all along: that even a moderate measure of force will work 
to rein in Serbian aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 FEELING THE PINCH: That axiom may be somewhat less true now of the Serbs in 
Belgrade, who apparently feel fully the deep and harsh pinch of U.N. economic 
sanctions. Furiously, it seems, Belgrade is seeking to have those sanctions 
eased and dropped -- perhaps even if they have to throw their Bosnian warrior 
friends over the side. If they stick to that line, sanctions could, and perhaps 
even should, be lifted someday. But in return for ending all sanctions, the 
West must insist on an end to Serbian aggression not just in Bosnia-Herzegovina 
but elsewhere in that region. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, if Belgrade does cease shipping arms and supplies to its Bosnian 
allies, how long a test of good faith would be reasonable? The world's goal 
here should be to end the fighting and establish a stable peace. If things were 
to go very well indeed, the sanctions could perhaps be eased as early as 
Christmas.

STOP THE FIGHT, IT'S GETTING UGLY; BILATERAL BASHING OF TOKYO IS GETTING U.S. 
NOWHERE IN TRADE TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once again the Clinton Administration has taken a battering-ram approach to 
open up the Japanese market. U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor threatens 
to level punitive measures against Tokyo if, after a 60-day negotiating period, 
the Japanese government does not agree to buy a greater share of 
telecommunications and medical equipment from U.S. firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor is right on the issue of expanding access to Japan. His frustration 
over the latest deadlock is understandable. For 15 years the United States and 
Japan have been unable resolve the fact that American suppliers have only a 
pathetic share of Japanese government purchases. Alas, Kantor's blustery 
rhetoric may get Tokyo's attention, but it sends the wrong signal from the 
United States, which is supposed to be a pacesetter in liberalizing 
international trade. Tokyo, meanwhile, has done a masterful PR job: By casting 
the United States as a villain pushing for "managed trade," it has cynically 
won support from other nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Dare we risk a trade war? Weakening the specter of sanctions is the 
possibility that Kantor's rhetoric may prove to be another empty threat from 
the Administration. Like it or not, U.S.-Japanese business interests -- and the 
two economies -- are inextricably joined at the hip. Meanwhile, U.S. leverage 
over Tokyo is in flux as Japan exports more to Asia than to the United States. 
Now Tokyo tells its Asian partners that if America gets away with "managed 
trade" with Japan, they will be treated the same. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States might do a lot better to resolve its trade complaints with 
Japan through a multilateral forum, drawing on the support from nations which 
share U.S. complaints about Japan. Tokyo might better yield to worldwide 
pressure from say the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade or its successor, 
the World Trade Organization, or perhaps from the Asia-Pacific Economic 
Cooperation group. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S.-Japan bilateral has become predictable -- talks, threats, some 
unsatisfactory solution -- then back to square one: Continuing obstacles to 
Japanese markets. When the Administration batters Tokyo, it undercuts the 
larger strategic relationship. A new approach is needed.

CONGRESSIONAL WHITEWATER HEARINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * So White House Counsel Lloyd N. Cutler tells Congress and the American 
public that "at least a dozen White House aides had more than 20 questionable 
contacts with federal regulators" about the Whitewater affair but they violated 
no ethical standards (July 27)! One wonders what standards, set by whom, Cutler 
is talking about. As Cutler is an attorney, a certain healthy skepticism about 
his standards is called for.

that has resulted from 40 years of one-party rule. The vindictive, 
authoritarian, dictatorial manner of Rep. Henry Gonzalez and the wildly 
sanctimonious, partisan screechings of several of the Democrat members of the 
committee had the unintended consequence of showing the American people just 
how out of touch the House majority is. The House committee "hearings" could be 
used with great effect in a campaign ad for term limits. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the Senate committee chairman (Rep. Donald Riegle Jr.) and 
members (with very few exceptions) conducted themselves with minimal 
partisanship as if they really were searching for the truth rather than trying 
to hide it. Interestingly enough, several of the members who one would have 
expected to pimp for the Administration by lobbing "softball" questions were 
strangely silent except for their opening statements. Are they covering their 
bets, preparing for a Republican majority in the next Senate?

 * Regarding to Whitewater and Watergate: 
</P>
<P>
 Something no one seems to be aware of, or not talking about, is that those who 
are trying the hardest to make Whitewater into another Watergate cannot 
conceive of anyone not acting in an illegal manner when in a position of power. 
That the President's staff was acting in a perfectly innocent manner is 
something they just cannot give any credence to, even in the face of 
overpowering evidence and an independent investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 What truly bothers me is whether this faith in the criminal intent of persons 
in the White House is endemic to the "inside the Beltway" persons or is it 
endemic to conservative/Republican persons?

 * Re "Bentsen Sought Documents in Ongoing Ethics Probe," July 31: 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the current concern over possible unethical conduct by the 
Administration and the Treasury Department, one would think Lloyd Bentsen would 
bend over backward to avoid any appearance of impropriety. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, last month he forwarded to the White House copies of interviews 
conducted during an ongoing ethics review of the Clinton Administration's 
handling of the Whitewater affair! 
</P>
<P>
 Such arrogance is possible only because Democrat Bentsen knows he is protected 
by the Democratic Party's control over the committees in both houses of 
Congress as well as the executive branch. America is now witnessing the evils 
of one-party rule.

SPACE WATCH; BY JUPITER! 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Probably no natural event in modern times has quite so awed and humbled us as 
the spectacular fiery assault of the Shoemaker-Levy 9 comet on Jupiter. From a 
distance of 500 million miles came dazzling images of the impact of the comet's 
20 fragments.It is daunting to think that one of them left a black scar on the 
Jovian surface larger than the entire planet Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Even veteran astronomers were thunderstruck at the size and power of the 
event, saying that their understanding of planetary physics would have to be 
revamped. The impact has generated a bonanza of new data from the Hubble Space 
Telescope that will keep scientists busy for years, and further images from the 
Galileo spacecraft are due in a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The general public has been stirred too. Seldom does the public get a chance 
to witness science so dramatically, or to participate in the spirit of 
excitement, adventure and intellectual curiosity that drives scientific 
discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Congress looked up from such dreary earthly concerns as Whitewater to 
direct NASA to search for similar asteroids and comets that could threaten our 
planet. And there was renewed interest in the theory -- still unconfirmed -- 
that it was the crash of an asteroid in Mexico 65 million years ago that led to 
the extinction of dinosaurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Writing in the journal Nature, Clark R. Chapman of the Planetary Science 
Institute in Tucson put it well: "The black patches on Jupiter have converted 
planetary impact processes from the realm of theoretical possibilities and 
ancient geological history to a manifest, dynamic reality."

SBA HELP FOR QUAKE VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re your editorial, six months after the Northridge earthquake, "The Numbers 
Tell a Story," July 19: 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration and the Small Business Administration (SBA) will 
not be satisfied that enough has been done for Northridge earthquake victims 
until we are satisfied that we have taken all reasonable steps to provide all 
the assistance we can under the laws that govern our program. 
</P>
<P>
 Statistics reflect the sheer magnitude of the Northridge earthquake damage, 
which we know was the most destructive disaster in American history. The SBA 
has already issued 501,997 disaster loan applications, compared with a combined 
total of 435,354 for all the major disasters in recent years: Hurricane Hugo 
(1989), the Loma Prieta earthquake (1989), the Los Angeles civil disorders 
(1992), Hurricane Andrew (1992), Hurricane Iniki (1992), Typhoon Omar (1992) 
and the great Midwest floods (1993). Similarly, the SBA has already received 
211,598 disaster loan applications from Northridge victims, compared with a 
combined total of 173,296 of the seven mega-disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 I have made Northridge quake disaster assistance a priority and we have 
committed major resources, including more than 3,200 employees, to the effort. 
The amount of SBA disaster loan approvals for Northridge (about $3 billion) has 
surpassed the combined totals for the seven mega-disasters.  
</P>
<P>
 With the application filing period for federal assistance still open, the 
Northridge response is still under way. Currently, the SBA receives more than 
1,000 loan requests each week and approves nearly 2,500 loans for more than 
$110 million weekly. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the editorial states that the gap between the number of applications 
distributed and the number completed and filed with SBA is too large, the 
percent of applications filed (the return rate) is larger than our experience 
with previous disasters since we began to work with teleregistration. In 
Northridge, 211,598, or 42.2%, of the applications distributed have been 
completed and returned to SBA thus far. The average return rates for the seven 
major disasters cited above was 40%.  
</P>
<P>
 We have made considerable effort to lessen our paperwork burden for a disaster 
loan. We have simplified both our home and business loan applications, and are 
continuing the process of trying to simplify further. We do agree that the 
process is discouraging because it has not always been properly explained and 
because of the long time factor. We are currently addressing both of these 
problem. We are present in 10 emergency service centers maintained by FEMA and 
have 15 loan-closing centers in the area. These addresses can be received by 
calling our toll-free number, 1 (800) 488-5323. This number has sufficient 
operators and technical personnel on call to provide answers to applicant's 
questions and status reports.  
</P>
<P>
 We do not believe that language barriers have been a significant factor in 
disaster victims not applying for loans or completing their loan applications. 
We have multilingual employees in both Los Angles and Sacramento and have made 
considerable use of the AT&T language line service. 
</P>
<P>
 The downturn in the economy is certainly a major factor in disqualifying 
applicants who otherwise might have qualified for aid. However, we do not feel 
that we would be good stewards of our taxpayer dollars if we were to 
significantly relax our loan standards. Our loss rate since the beginning of 
the program now stands at 10% and this may increase when the loans made in the 
past four high-volume years start to mature. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a loan can be approved, we must determine that there is repayment 
ability. Our standards are considerably more liberal than those of Fannie Mae 
for home loans and any commercial lender for business loans.

FUNDS FOR PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Nora Zamichow's July 17 column, "Rethinking Our Transportation Dollars" 
(special section, The Next Los Angeles) is misleading in its portrayal of 
national public transportation ridership. Zamichow claims that "nationwide, 
despite billions poured into erecting elaborate rail systems, fewer and fewer 
people use public transportation." The fact is that between 20% and 53% of 
workers use public transportation in 17 U.S. cities including New York, 
Washington, San Francisco, Boston, Chicago and Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 To further set the record straight, federal transit aid has helped to get 
people onto mass transit. As the federal transit program matured between 
1970-1990, transit ridership increased from 7.3 billion trips annually to 
almost 9 billion. Admittedly, patronage fell in the last few years, largely due 
to the job-shrinking recession.  
</P>
<P>
 But today, riders are flocking back to buses and trains. National ridership 
grew by 42 million boarding in the first three months of 1994, marking the 
third consecutive quarter in which bus and rail patronage has increased. 
Indeed, several of the "elaborate" rail systems that your article cites have 
paced the overall ridership surge. For example, patronage of light-rail systems 
grew 8.3% from January to March of this year, paced by the hugely successful 
new MetroLink in St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, your article ignores the major role that immense government 
parking, automobile and highway subsidies and declining federal transit 
assistance have played in suppressing transit ridership. Subsidies to the 
street, highway and free-parking systems have reached more than $300 billion 
per year. Real federal transit aid declined by more than 50% between 1981 and 
1991. Both factors deal a heavy blow to efforts to increase transit ridership. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamichow is right, we do need to rethink how we spend our transportation 
dollars. But instead of decreasing investment for public transportation, we 
should ask if it is not time that automobile users pay their fair share of the 
economic and environmental costs they impose on society.

FEDERAL AGENCY TO TAKE LEAD IN MALIBU FIRE INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although the Los Angeles County district attorney's office declined to file 
charges against two firefighters suspected of setting last fall's deadly 
Calabasas/Malibu brush fire, federal investigators are continuing their probe 
of the Nov. 2 blaze, a government spokesman said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 John D'Angelo, a spokesman for the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms, said the agency would take over the lead role in the ongoing review 
of the fire, which killed three people and caused $375 million in damage as it 
blackened coastal hillsides from Calabasas to the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which spearheaded earlier parts 
of the investigation, will continue to offer support, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Angelo said he could not comment on whether the continuing investigation 
would involve firefighters Steven Shelp and Nicholas Durepo, named as suspects 
in the fire before a county grand jury that disbanded without returning 
indictments against them. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Deputy Dist. Atty. Sally Thomas announced at a news conference that 
no charges would be filed against the firefighters for lack of evidence. 
Spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons said the district attorney's office would cooperate 
with federal officials. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Angelo said the BATF has the authority to investigate fires that disrupt 
interstate commerce.

D.A. WON'T CHARGE MOTHER IN ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A North Hollywood woman who left her child unattended in a car, which led to a 
freak accident that injured five children, will not be charged with felony 
child endangerment, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We determined it would be inappropriate to file felony charges because she 
left the child in the car for only a few brief moments," Los Angeles Deputy 
Dist. Atty.David Mintz said. "Tragically, that is all it took for the child to 
put the car in gear." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Estela Lopez, 33, left her car running as she returned to her 
apartment to retrieve her purse when her youngest child climbed into her 1984 
Ford Thunderbird and shifted it into gear. The car slammed into five children, 
all under the age of 10, seriously injuring four of them, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The four children received no permanent injuries and have all been released 
from local hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Mintz said Lopez was extremely remorseful and had no prior criminal history. 
</P>
<P>
 The case, as a matter of procedure, was referred to the city attorney's office 
Friday, where misdemeanor child endangerment charges will be considered, Mintz 
said. If convicted of misdemeanor charges, Lopez faces a year in County Jail 
and a $1,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't intend for anyone to be injured," Mintz said. "Some of the victims 
were relatives of hers."

1989 MURDER CONVICTION IS OVERTURNED; COURTS: APPELLATE PANEL RULES THAT 
WITNESS'S TESTIMONY ABOUT WESTMINSTER SHOOTING WAS BASED ON HEARSAY. THE RULING 
ALLOWS A RETRIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal appeals court overturned an Orange County murder conviction Friday 
because a witness, when asked how she knew that the defendant was the gunman, 
said, "People were talking." 
</P>
<P>
 That hearsay testimony, by a woman who first came forward five years after the 
killing to seek a $5,000 reward, should not have been used against Paul Albert 
Guardado, said the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 The court said the woman's firsthand, non-hearsay observations failed to 
establish that Guardado was even holding a gun at the time of the 1979 murder. 
The ruling allows a retrial. 
</P>
<P>
 Guardado was convicted in 1989 of second-degree murder in the September, 1979, 
killing of Steven Buus, who was shot three times as he walked past a group of 
youths in a Westminster park. Another man, Gabriel Ramirez, whose appeal was 
not before the court, was convicted of first-degree murder. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The killing went unsolved until 1984, when a woman named Corina Ribota 
approached police and asked about the $5,000 reward. In an unsworn statement 
that a detective tape-recorded, she identified Ramirez as the man who fired the 
fatal shotgun blast and also said at first that she saw Guardado holding a 
handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 But in follow-up questioning, Ribota was evasive about whether she actually 
saw the handgun, the court said. She volunteered, however, that she knew 
Guardado had fired the first two shots; when the detective asked how she knew 
it, Ribota said that at a gathering after the shooting, "people were talking 
and everything." 
</P>
<P>
 At the trial five years later, Ribota asserted she remembered nothing about 
the shooting or her conversation with the detective and said that in 1984 she 
had been using drugs and needed money. 
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge allowed the jury to hear Ribota's 1984 interview, which 
was the main evidence against Guardado, the court said. Other witnesses placed 
him at the park and said he had a gun in a car earlier in the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 A state appeals court ruled that the "people were talking" statement was 
inadmissible hearsay, because the "people" weren't identified or available to 
be questioned. But the state court said the statement could not have affected 
the verdict, because the rest of Ribota's testimony was admissible and 
supported Guardado's guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Guardado, who is serving a sentence of up to life in prison, appealed 
unsuccessfully to the state Supreme Court, and U.S. District Judge Alicemarie 
H. Stotler before reaching the 9th Circuit. The court said the "people were 
talking" statement, the only testimony that Guardado had shot at Buus, was 
likely to have influenced the verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 A conviction required proof that Guardado had at least pointed a gun at Buus, 
the court said. Without the hearsay testimony that he had fired the gun, 
Ribota's uncertain statements about his holding the gun, and the evidence of 
her drug use and financial motives, might have left the jury unconvinced of his 
guilt, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
 The court declined to rule on Guardado's contention that the entire taped 
interview was hearsay that should have been excluded. The defense can raise 
that issue at a retrial, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous ruling was issued by Judges Betty Fletcher and Dorothy Nelson 
and U.S. District Judge Hubert Will of Illinois, temporarily assigned to the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm happy to hear that a court has finally made the right decision," said 
Kenneth M. Stern, appointed by the court to represent Guardado. Without the 
testimony excluded by the court, he said, the prosecution had a weak case, 
"based wholly upon an admitted drug user who admitted wanting to get money for 
drugs" when she came forward. 
</P>
<P>
 A prosecution lawyer could not be reached for comment.

OIL EXPORTS AND JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Michael Parrish correctly states the economic opportunities awaiting the 
U.S. by lifting the ban on the export of Alaskan crude ("Study Sees 25,000 Oil 
Jobs If Alaska Export Ban Ends," July 1). An additional benefit not mentioned 
is the reduction in our dependency on foreign oil.By allowing the export of 
Alaskan crude we can effectively reduce the amount of oil imported. The fear of 
higher oil prices due to the introduction of the higher-quality oil is 
irrational if we consider the price we will ultimately pay for our dependency 
on foreign oil. Just recall the 1973 oil embargo and the prices we were paying 
at the pump during the Gulf War. The boost the American economy (and 
particularly California's) can get from lifting the ban is well worth the 
consequences.

PACIFIC COAST, A PRIVATE NURSING SCHOOL, CLOSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A private nursing school shut down Friday, closing the doors on nearly 600 
students who attended classes at campuses in Santa Ana and Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Coast College officials disclosed little information about the 
closing, referring all questions to the school's corporate parent in Los 
Angeles, United Education and Software. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials there could not be reached for comment, but top executives had 
complained to school administrators that Pacific Coast was losing money at the 
rate of about $75,000 a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Coast College students may be able to seek some sort of relief for 
their lost classes from the California Student Tuition Recovery Fund. But it 
was not clear yesterday whether they will be able to transfer their credits to 
other private schools or community colleges with similar courses. 
</P>
<P>
 United Education and Software has a history of financial difficulties dating 
back to December, 1989, when the corporation filed for bankruptcy protection. 
Officials there took that action after a series of problems including student 
loan-processing foul-ups, a federal audit of one of the company's schools and a 
consumer-protection complaint brought by the state of California. 
</P>
<P>
 The consumer protection complaint was eventually settled when the company 
agreed to provide $6.5 million in loan credits for students who were owed 
refunds.

BECKER STARTS SLOWLY, THEN SURGES; L.A. OPEN: HE LOSES THE FIRST SET, TRAILS BY 
3-0 IN THE SECOND BEFORE DEFEATING BRAASCH.

 Boris Becker of Germany advanced to the semifinals of the Los Angeles Open 
with a 2-6, 7-6 (7-1), 6-2 victory over countryman Karsten Braasch on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In other matches, No. 5 Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands defeated Jan Apell 
of Sweden, 6-4, 7-6 (7-5), and Mark Woodforde of Australia held off Jared 
Palmer, 6-7 (7-5), 6-3, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 3 Andre Agassi was to play No. 6 Jason Stoltenberg of Australia in a night 
match. The winner will play Becker on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The eighth-seeded Braasch opened strongly with two service breaks as Becker 
sprayed unforced errors around the court in the first set. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker trailed, 3-0, in the second set before breaking Braasch in the fourth 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that point, I was thinking I could win it," Braasch said, "but I didn't 
have the guts to go for it. He started playing better and I just didn't have 
any strength anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 They stayed on serve until the 10th game, when Braasch served for the match, 
leading by 40-15. He double-faulted and then received a warning for violating 
the 25-second time limit between serves. 
</P>
<P>
 That was merely the start of Braasch's problems. Three consecutive backhand 
errors helped Becker tie the set, 5-5. In the tiebreaker, Becker led by 6-0 
before serving it out to tie the match. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker dominated the third set, wrapping it up in two hours before hurrying 
off to play a doubles match. 
</P>
<P>
 "You learn from matches like this," Braasch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Krajicek, the two-time defending champion, endured 103-degree temperatures in 
defeating Apell, who upset No. 4 Alexander Volkov in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very, very warm," Krajicek said. "It's always tough to play under 
those conditions. I didn't think I was going to make it."

DALUISO GLAD TO JUST KICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NEIL S. COHEN, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With all the attention Tony Meola has been receiving at the New York Jets' 
training camp, it's practically gone unnoticed the New York Giants also have a 
new placekicker. And if Brad Daluiso has his way, he won't do anything to bring 
the spotlight on himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as a kicker is doing his job, there's no reason to write about him," 
said Daluiso, the former UCLA Bruin who is in his fourth season in the NFL, his 
second with the Giants. "The key for me is not to do anything that attracts 
attention. I just want to go out and make my kicks and keep it quiet." 
</P>
<P>
 As a kickoff and long-field goal specialist last season, Daluiso made one of 
the loudest kicks for the Giants. His 54-yarder with 32 seconds left in the 
game gave the Giants a 19-17 victory against the Phoenix Cardinals on Nov. 28. 
It was the last of three field-goal attempts Daluiso took last season, all over 
50 yards, and the only one he made. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard when you get three attempts in one year," Daluiso said. "Nobody 
likes to miss and wait six weeks to get another attempt. It's nice I happened 
to make the last one." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his limited game experience, the Giants had enough confidence in 
Daluiso to cut David Treadwell, who made 25 of 31 field goals and 28 of 29 
extra points, in May. Treadwell has since signed with the Kansas City Chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to give him the chance," special teams coach Joe DeCamillis said. 
"We just felt Brad was best for our team. ... He's been improving. He started 
out average and become a little bit above." 
</P>
<P>
 In last week's 20-19 preseason loss to the Miami Dolphins, Daluiso made a 
24-yard field goal in his only attempt. That success has carried over to 
practice this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's only missed one I've held this whole week," punter/holder Mike Horan 
said. "He's gaining a lot of confidence as he experiences success. He knows the 
job is his and just has to prove he can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing the job is his is a change for Daluiso, who also played for Atlanta, 
Buffalo and Denver before signing with the Giants in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good, you don't have to share the net," Daluiso said. "You don't have to 
worry about range, (or whether) is this my kick or is this David's. I (hadn't) 
hit a 24-yard field goal in three years." 
</P>
<P>
 With the NFL moving kickoffs from the 35- to the 30-yard line, Daluiso's 
strong leg becomes more important. In his career, 119 of his 207 kickoffs have 
been touchbacks. Last week, the Dolphins' average starting point after kickoffs 
was the 28-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't bother me," said Daluiso about the rule change. "We won't get as 
many touchbacks, but it's going to help that I can still kick the ball further 
than other people." 
</P>
<P>
 As for Meola, Daluiso, who played soccer in high school and college, said the 
most important thing to learn is patience. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes time. I'm living proof of that," Daluiso said. "This is my sixth 
year of football and it's taken me this long where I'm really comfortable 
hitting field goals. A lot of guys can bang the ball downfield. It's a little 
different when you need to place it."

IT'S TIME TELEVISION PICKED UP THE SOCCER BALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Times' coverage of the 1994 World Cup was fantastic, and 
undoubtedly the tournament was a great boost for soccer in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 So now what? Millions of Americans, who over the last 60 days learned to enjoy 
the world's game for the first time, will see it return to its snail's-pace 
development in this country due to one factor -- lack of television coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Local television stations simply have to take the ball and dribble with it. 
Start with 20 seconds of soccer highlights on the evening news. Next, profile a 
local professional player, maybe 40 seconds. How about "goal of the week," 
another 15 seconds. Eventually, work up to a game of the week. 
</P>
<P>
 When compared to the daily barrage of three-hour baseball games, the air time 
would be negligible. 
</P>
<P>
 The world's most popular country can embrace and compete in the world's most 
popular game with the addition of only one element: We simply must be able to 
view it.

 Thanks for your great World Cup coverage. Now that the tournament is over, I 
hope you won't forget the sport itself. The Los Angeles Salsa needs your 
coverage. Major League Soccer is gearing up, and the college season starts 
soon. UCLA, Cal State Northridge and Cal State Fullerton each have fine 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Cup was a great festival, but please remember that there is a 
beautiful sport behind it all.

COMING UNRAVELED OVER RAVELING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If I thought George Raveling's USC teams were poorly coached in the past, then 
I hadn't seen anything until I witnessed his pitiful coaching performance in 
the Goodwill Games. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team was consistently outrebounded, outhustled, outcoached, 
outsmarted and outmaneuvered. And, as usual, Raveling's yelling and physical 
gyrations on the sideline were a sight to behold. 
</P>
<P>
 Seton Hall basketball fans should breathe a sigh of relief that Raveling 
decided to remain at USC.

SAVE THE RAMS? NO, LET THEM GO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We just got our Ram season tickets and would like Georgia to explain something 
about fan support. We've been season ticket-holders for seven years and we 
still are in the corner of the end zone.We have not been upgraded in about five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 This would indicate a lot of season ticket-holders are returning, even after 
seasons that would make the Clippers blush. Being stuck in those seats year 
after year is not what you'd expect from a team that allegedly has no fan 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 If it's as bad as Georgia says it is, you'd think we'd be sitting on the 50 by 
now. So, Georgia, who's not supporting who?

 The idea of "We love you, Georgia" T-shirts has got to be the biggest crock 
I've ever heard. A majority, if not all, the businessmen and women I deal with 
daily can't stand this woman, let alone John Shaw. They have no interest in 
supporting the Rams unless there is a change in ownership and management. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line remains the same. Who is running a franchise matters much more 
than where the franchise is located.

BASEBALL'S THREATENED WALKOUT STRIKES MANY OBSERVERS AS CURIOUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'd bet my life that team owners are responsible for the juiced baseball. It's 
their most potent strike-breaker. They knew that by feeding the egomaniacal 
prima donna players a juiced ball, many would be flirting with statistically 
magical seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 If there's a strike, all possibilities vanish. Any impressive achievement 
would be asterisked into obscurity. The owners are not as dumb as they look. 
Next year, the ball will be unjuiced, lest their employees start thinking they 
deserve more money.

can't afford to be out of work. 
</P>
<P>
 Excuse me, Ozzie, but aren't these same young players making $115,000 a year? 
</P>
<P>
 Here's hoping the owners use Ozzie's $25,000-per-game salary to keep the 
peanut vendors, line cooks and ushers on the payroll during the players' 
strike. They are the ones who really can't afford this.

 It's hard to feel sorry for a bunch of guys who make millions of dollars each

negative attitude. 
</P>

 I say cap them out at $100,000 because it's a hell of a lot more than they 
would make in the real world, where accountability really means something.

 Hey, guys, if there's a strike, you won't be able to watch 10 players scratch, 
spit and twitch for minutes on end while waiting for an occasional foot to 
touch home plate guarded by a padded, well-protected player. 
</P>
<P>
 Back to soccer, where 22 players are working hard, nonstop against one another 
all over a field larger than any football field, whether the ball goes near or 
into a 24-foot by 8-foot net protected by an unpadded player. You want action?

SANDERS SHARP IN PADRES' VICTORY OVER CUBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Scott Sanders liked what he saw when he looked at the flags on top of Wrigley 
Field's scoreboard Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Williams and Bip Roberts just ignored them. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders allowed one hit in eight innings Friday to lead the San Diego Padres 
to a 4-2 victory over the Chicago Cubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a better than average slider," Padres manager Jim Riggleman said. "He 
was in the strike zone more often and that, combined with his slider, made him 
effective." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders also had the wind blowing in his favor. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the first thing I look at when I come to Wrigley Field, to see if the 
wind is blowing in or out," said Sanders, who entered the game with an 0-1 
record and 11.25 ERA in two career starts against the Cubs, although only one 
was in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 However, both Williams and Roberts each hit solo homers into the wind blowing 
off Lake Michigan at 17 mph. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eddie hit the ball so hard that even with the wind blowing in we knew it was 
out of here," Riggleman said. "Bip's ball, I don't know what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders (4-8) won for the first time since June 19, snapping a personal 
four-game losing streak. He walked two and struck out 11, tying his personal 
best set in his last win. 
</P>
<P>
 After Sanders walked Mark Grace leading off the ninth, Trevor Hoffman came on 
for his 18th save. But he allowed an RBI double by Derrick May before finishing 
off the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I even felt strong in the ninth," Sanders said. "But I threw two balls 
outside and they sunk away. We decided to let Trevor finish." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders held the Cubs without a hit until Sammy Sosa reached on an infield hit 
with two outs in the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Haney was hit in the back by a pitch leading off the sixth, advanced on a 
groundout and reached third on Sosa's hit, which was knocked down by second 
baseman Ricky Gutierrez. Haney then scored on a wild pitch to make it 2-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Willie Banks (8-11) took the loss, and remained winless in seven starts since 
June 27. He gave up 12 hits in eight innings, walked two and struck out three. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no reason to put my head down," Banks said. "The guy on the other team 
pitched a better game. He did what I wanted to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "You pitch eight innings and give up three runs, that's a quality start," 
Banks said.

ANGELS LOSE TO MARINERS AND PREDICT A HOSTILE STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Angels may have been back on the field Thursday, but they proclaimed they 
can no longer trust baseball ownership, and predicted a hostile strike that 
will endure a minimum of two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two sides now are more apart than ever," said Angel shortstop Gary 
DiSarcina, assistant player representative. "I think we'll be out at least two 
weeks now. Before, I thought it might be a lot less, but not now." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who lost 4-2 to the Seattle Mariners in front of 12,222 at Anaheim 
Stadium, chose not to strike today and will wait until Aug. 12. Still, they 
remain angered at baseball ownership's decision not to make their scheduled 
payment to the players' pension program. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we acted out of emotion," Angel second baseman Harold Reynolds said, "none 
of us would be here today." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Mark Langston, Angel player representative: "Players were so infuriated, 
they were ready to walk out now. We're not about to be bullied by their 
tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to get something done, but right now it's very difficult for me to 
see that something will get resolved." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the Angels' frustration lies in the fact that they were beginning to 
trust ownership. Angel owners Gene and Jackie Autry, in fact, even invited 
Langston and DiSarcina to their hotel suite last week when the team was in 
Texas. Jackie Autry explained the Angels' position, insisting a salary cap and 
revenue sharing is needed to stay competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a good, positive meeting with her," DiSarcina said, "and she told us 
how she wants to put collusion and distrust behind. You want to believe, and 
then, two, three days later, we don't get our pension. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like gasoline was thrown on the fire. I mean, you sit here and listen 
to how they talk, how they want to earn our trust, and it's all (garbage). 
</P>
<P>
 "How can you be partners with people that do that, and then screw with our 
pension plan? That's money that goes to our families. To play with the players' 
families, that goes beyond hardball. That's dirty." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, considering the way the Angels (44-65) are playing, the front 
office wonders if the players are holding up their end of the bargain. The 
Angels, who have lost 11 of their last 14 games now have the worst record in 
the American League at a season-low 21 games under .500, their worst record at 
this juncture since 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of being grateful that the players will continue playing until at 
least Aug. 12, who could blame management for being irritated they didn't 
strike? 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the pennant race from hell, and look at us," Angel General Manager 
Bill Bavasi said. "It's very, very frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 So, someone jokingly asked, he was not disturbed by negotiator Richard 
Ravitch's decision to stop pension payments? 
</P>
<P>
 "Why would I be (teed) at that," Bavasi said, "after watching this for (three) 
days. I wonder if he's teed at me for putting this thing together." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps even more painful is that things could get worse, pending the length 
of the strike. If the strike lasts the duration of the season, sources say the 
Angels are projecting losses as $6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "A strike will put us very deep in the red," said Angel President Richard 
Brown, declining to be specific. "Just say it will cost us lots and lots of 
money.  
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball is bigger than the players. It's bigger than the owners. It's going 
to survive somehow, it's just a matter of how many casualties (the strike) will 
take with them." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the Angels must abide by the Major League Players Assn.'s 
decision, and continue to play games until the strike. They managed to lose 
their latest game when pinch-hitter Eric Anthony hit a pinch-hit two-run homer 
in the eighth inning off closer Mark Leiter, and a 2-1 lead became a 4-2 
defeat.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; FORMER COWBOY GOGAN GOING HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kevin Gogan is going back home. Back to where his professional life began. 
Back to Texas Stadium. Back on the field with the Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Gogan emerges on that field Sunday night for an exhibition game, 
it'll be from another entrance in another uniform as a member of the Raiders 
and the right guard admits it'll be strange. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm excited," he said, "but it'll be weird coming out on the other side. I'm 
going to be playing back in front of some good fans and good friends. And I'm 
going to be playing against some good friends who I'm going to try to knock 
down and out. Or maybe they'll knock me down and out, but it'll be fun." 
</P>
<P>
 At 6-7 and 315 pounds, Gogan doesn't get knocked down and out too often, and 
Sunday it would appear he'll have a further edge in facing people he's 
practiced against for years. "I would hope so," Gogan said. "But they are 
highly talented people who know what I do good and what I do bad, so they have 
an advantage on me, too." 
</P>
<P>
 There'll be one big difference from Gogan's final years in Dallas -- the head 
coach. It's now Barry Switzer, not Jimmy Johnson, who left following last 
season's Super Bowl victory after finding he could no longer co-exist with 
owner Jerry Jones. Gogan, a big Johnson booster, said, "I think he should still 
be coach. But I guess there are people who still feel that way about Tom 
Landry. Things change." STEVE SPRINGER

MOST RAM FANS THINK HENLEY SIGNING SENDS WRONG MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Friday's Times Orange County, readers were asked the following: Should the 
Rams have signed cornerback Darryl Henley to play football while he is awaiting 
trial on cocaine distribution and possession charges? 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fact that Henley has yet to be convicted of anything, respondents 
by phone and fax came down overwhelmingly against the Rams' decision: 
</P>
<P>
 The Henley situation is yet another instance of the privileged -- the wealthy, 
the influential or the "talented" -- flaunting the system and running 
unfettered over the population. 
</P>
<P>
 But the gut issue here, the main concern, the main disservice to the people is 
the impact on the youth in Southern California. Just look at the message -- 
"It's OK to deal drugs as long as you are an athlete!" What are young persons 
expected to think?

 The staple of our society is supposed to be innocent until proven guilty. 
Instead, we are a society of judgmental jerks. Darryl Henley has every right to 
work and earn a living just like everybody else in our society until he has his 
day in court and they find him guilty. That has not happened and until it does, 
of course the Rams should have signed him. Anybody that thinks any different 
doesn't really understand what our society is about.

 No accused drug dealer should be allowed to play any professional sport.

 I resent the fact that Henley lived in the lovely town of Brea and (allegedly) 
tainted it by pushing drugs around the country.

<P>
 Going to trial in January shouldn't faze Darryl Henley. Playing before Ram 
fans, he's used to juries. 
</P>
<P>
 If Henley is injured, the Rams can use the Menendez boys. They can be 
contacted through their agent, Charles Manson.

 We all know that suspects are to be considered innocent until proven guilty, 
but athletes are public figures and often considered to be role models for our 
youth. It is a travesty if the Rams have to draw from players under indictment 
for drug trafficking. 
</P>
<P>
 It is sad that it becomes so obvious that all the members of the NFL care 
about is winning and the money involved. I would hope that Henley will donate 
his salary this year to drug rehab programs, but I would bet his attorneys will 
get it instead.

 Even though he hasn't been convicted of anything, I think this sends a really 
bad message to society. We are supposed to be saying no to drugs and this sends 
a very bad message in general. What about the other defendants -- do they have 
the same luxury?

 I've seen almost all of the Rams' home games for the past 32 years and I am 
terribly disappointed that the Rams re-signed this guy. Anyone who would cause 
the kind of damage to my grandkids, that creates this type of poison to our 
youth, doesn't deserve such a position.

 I think that users have a special consideration because most of us who work in 
this field believe that rehabilitation is the way to go as far as treatment 
especially for athletes and public figures. However, distribution and 
possession is a whole different type and category and I don't think the Rams 
made a wise decision in this particular case of bringing him back. I am not 
trying to make him guilty before he is actually proven, but these are 
particularly serious charges.

 I believe that the Rams signing Henley is a despicable act and counter to what 
any good judgment should have led to. He is an indicted drug dealer and as such 
should not be held up to be a model or given athletic standing in the 
community. If the Rams have Henley on their roster at the beginning of the 
official season I will not go to any games or watch them on TV and will pray 
they find a way to leave Orange County for a community that will accept a drug 
dealer as one of its sports figures.

 The Rams handling in the Henley matter is incomprehensible. How anyone that is 
under indictment should be allowed in professional sports is beyond my belief. 
It just goes to show the owners' insensitivity to the public.

 It is just great! He is a great defensive back. He helped the Rams out and 
after his absence, the Rams seemed to fail in their secondary. After all, I am 
kind of outraged by all the people who called in and were upset, and canceled 
season tickets -- I think they jumped to conclusions, because this is America 
and a person is innocent until proven guilty and there is no reason why he 
shouldn't be able to play.

 I think it is a gross indication of the caliber of the people who are managing 
pro sports, the NFL and particularly the Rams to have a man who is charged with 
distribution of cocaine playing on their team under a salary without any 
conditions whatsoever. This is getting down to the nitty-gritty. Where are we 
going to draw the line? This man has no business playing for the Rams until he 
is cleared. I have been disappointed in the Rams for a long time, but this is 
just more fuel on the fire.

TEXAS COMPANY BUYS 6.3% STAKE IN SYSTEMED INC.; STOCK: HOSTILE TAKEOVER IS 
FEARED. BUT FIRM SAYS IT BOUGHT O.C. DRUG DISTRIBUTOR'S SHARES BECAUSE THEY 
WERE UNDERVALUED. 
</P>

<P>
 A Texas holding company has acquired a 6.3% stake in SysteMed Inc. in recent 
months, in what could become another hostile takeover attempt on an Orange 
County firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at National Intergroup in Carrollton, Tex., would not comment on the 
acquisition of SysteMed stock by its unit, NII Health Care Corp., over the last 
two months. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, NII Health said 
that it bought SysteMed stock because it thinks the drug distribution company 
is undervalued. SysteMed has traded at about five times its book value per 
share so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
 NII Health may "determine to seek control of" SysteMed, according to the 
filing. NII Health also said it might explore a merger, business combination or 
buying additional shares before making any decision to seek control. 
</P>
<P>
 SysteMed officials were traveling Friday and could not be reached for comment. 
The company, based in Laguna Hills, has 15 employees in its local office and 
about 450 overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Orange County medical benefits company, US Facilities Corp. in Costa 
Mesa, also faces a hostile takeover bid; its suitor is Fidelity National 
Financial Inc. in Irvine. US Facilities won a legal battle last month when a 
Delaware court overturned the election of two directors nominated by Fidelity. 
</P>
<P>
 SysteMed provides drugs to consumers and manages prescription drug benefits 
for corporations and insurers. Its mail-service network serves about 30,000 
retail pharmacies. 
</P>
<P>
 SysteMed had revenue of $134.2 million in 1993, up from $117.5 million in 1992 
and $89.9 million in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Reacting to the news, SysteMed's stock rose 50 cents to $7.19 on Nasdaq, while 
shares of National Intergroup added 12.5 cents each to close at $18.375 in the 
NYSE.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; GOOD JOBS NEWS PUTS WALL STREET IN GLOOMY MOOD; MARKETS: 
BOND YIELDS JUMP, WHILE STOCKS AND THE DOLLAR WEAKEN. FEARS OF A FED HIKE IN 
INTEREST RATES ARE BACK.

 In trading action that has become all too familiar to investors this year, 
stock and bond markets sold off Friday on upbeat news about the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's report that the nation added more than a quarter of a million 
jobs in July fueled a surge in bond yields, as investors focused on the 
likelihood of another official interest rate hike by the Federal Reserve Board. 
</P>
<P>
 The 30-year Treasury bond yield, a benchmark for long-term interest rates such 
as mortgage rates, rocketed to 7.54% from 7.40% on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The stock market suffered relatively little, with the Dow Jones industrial 
average off 18.77 points at 3,747.02. But the negative mood on Wall Street was 
apparent as losing stocks outnumbered winners by 13 to 8 on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Many analysts believe that the July employment report was strong enough to 
reignite inflation worries at the Fed. The central bank has tightened credit 
four times this year, but the latest jobs data suggests that the economy is 
still growing faster than the Fed desires. Rapid growth can push up prices and 
wages, boosting inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Clinton Administration officials stressed that inflation remains 
moderate, even as hiring picks up. But the employment report shows that the 
hourly earnings of non-farm, non-supervisory workers rose 0.4% to $11.12 in 
July, an increase that disturbed some bond traders. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a week ago, bond yields had plunged after the government reported 
slower-than-expected growth in second-quarter gross domestic product. And last 
week, a host of other economic indicators pointed to slower growth in June. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday's employment report was the first important look at July economic 
activity, and its strength hinted that the economy picked up again after the 
spring slowdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly it's strong enough to make the Fed seriously consider" higher 
interest rates, said Bill Newman, investment strategist at brokerage Kidder 
Peabody. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's policy-making committee meets Aug. 16. Many Wall Streeters expect 
the Fed to boost short-term rates by as much as half a percentage point. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting those fears, short-term bond yields rose faster than long yields 
Friday. The yield on six-month Treasury bills surged to 5.11% from 4.90% on 
Thursday. The yield on two-year T-notes jumped to 6.23% from 5.97%. 
</P>
<P>
 The renewed rise in bond yields comes at an inopportune time for the Treasury, 
which next week will auction $40 billion in new bonds to raise cash. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, meanwhile, the damage Friday was fairly light considering 
bonds' losses. Trading volume on the NYSE was only 230 million shares, and most 
major indexes lost less than the Dow. The Nasdaq composite index of mostly 
smaller stocks, for example, eased just 1.51 points to 718.67. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts noted that many market players are away from the action on summer 
Fridays. Some Wall Streeters also say stock investors are growing weary of the 
bond market's constant swings and may not be moved by them unless yields jump 
to new highs. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Friday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Industrial stocks, many of which have rallied recently on healthy quarterly 
earnings reports, were hit by profit taking. 
</P>
<P>
 Caterpillar dropped 2 7/8 to 104 3/4, Fluor sank 2 3/8 to 51 5/8, Alumax fell 
7/8 to 29 3/4, Varity declined 1 7/8 to 34 1/2 and Cummins Engine sank 1 5/8 to 
38 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Financial stocks, which normally react badly to rising interest rates, were 
mixed. Morgan Stanley lost 1 3/8 to 62 5/8 and First Interstate Bancorp fell 1 
to 72 3/4, but Chase Manhattan inched up 1/8 to 35 5/8 and Glendale Federal 
rose 1/2 to 12 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Some technology stocks showed strength. Compaq leaped 1 3/8 to 33 5/8 after 
executives made upbeat comments about strong demand and declining computer 
inventories. Also, Scientific Atlanta, a supplier of equipment for cable TV and 
telecommunications industries, soared 4 3/4 to 39 after reporting that 
quarterly earnings more than doubled. 
</P>
<P>
 Other tech winners included Intel, up 7/8 to 58 1/8; Lotus, up 1 to 34 3/8, 
and Sybase, up 1 1/4 to 38 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the merger front, wireless communications firm NexTel Communications 
gained 1 1/8 to 26 3/4 after announcing it will buy Dial Page. Dial Page, which 
traded as high as 61 earlier this year, fell 1 3/8 to 30 5/8 on the merger 
terms. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among Southland issues, Kaiser Resources lost 1 to 8 1/4. Cincinnati-based 
Pacholder Associates, which owns 21.7% of Kaiser's stock, said it would seek 
representation on the board as part of its efforts to boost the stock. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign trading, Mexico City shares zoomed again, with the Bolsa index up 
69.16 points at 2,642.97, its highest level since Feb. 28. The market has been 
rocketing on optimism about the upcoming presidential elections and economic 
prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 In London, the FTSE-100 index gained 17.0 points to 3,167.5, while Frankfurt's 
DAX average inched up 1.40 points to 2,184.76. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei average lost 155.14 points to 20,521.70. 
</P>
<P>
 In U.S. currency trading, the dollar failed to get a lift from renewed 
speculation about another Fed credit-tightening move. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the dollar eased to 1.581 German marks from 1.588 on Thursday, 
and to 100.25 Japanese yen from 100.38.

MOM AND POP ON-LINE; BULLETIN BOARDS OFFER OPPORTUNITY -- BUT NOT ALWAYS PROFIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL BROADHURST, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 For thousands of Southern Californians, the route to the information 
superhighway runs through a spare bedroom in Greg Gooden's Van Nuys home. 
</P>
<P>
 As many as 60 people convene there at a time, using their personal computers 
and telephone lines to socialize, play games, use the library and pick up their 
mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Gooden's bedroom is the home of the Annex, one of tens of thousands of small 
computer bulletin board services springing up around the country. With start-up 
costs as low as a few thousand dollars, bulletin boards are a good 
entrepreneurial opportunity for the technically savvy -- and provide personal 
computer users with a friendly, low-cost alternative to national on-line 
services such as Prodigy, CompuServe and America Online. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you buy a modem, it usually comes with a trial subscription to one of 
the national services like Prodigy," says Dale Porter, 31, who runs a bulletin 
board called KBBS out of his home in Northridge. "But when the trial period 
ends and Prodigy sends you this big bill, you realize it's time to start 
shopping around. That's how a lot of my customers find me." 
</P>
<P>
 The mom-and-pop bulletin boards -- of which there are now an estimated 57,000 
nationwide, according to Boardwatch magazine -- have nowhere near the array of 
on-line publications, databases, and shopping opportunities that the national 
services offer. But small bulletin boards can often provide a cozy electronic 
meeting place for people with special interests -- dentists, for example, or 
stamp collectors. 
</P>
<P>
 And local, general-interest bulletin boards such as the Annex and KBBS are a 
bargain for PC owners who simply want to meet people through electronic "chat" 
sessions, play games and send electronic mail. 
</P>
<P>
 CompuServe, for example, charges $20 to join and levies a monthly fee of 
$8.95. Customers get unlimited access to the basic services, such as on-line 
publications and news files, but they can send only 60 mail messages a month 
without paying extra, and many of the more interesting services carry 
surcharges. 
</P>
<P>
 The Annex and KBBS, by contrast, offer full use of their systems for a flat 
rate. KBBS has a one-year subscription, which limits users to 90 minutes of 
on-line time each day, at $9.50 a month. A comparable subscription at the Annex 
costs $8 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some see other benefits as well. "One big attraction of a board like KBBS is 
its social character," says Sharon Landers, 32, who has been a KBBS subscriber 
for two years. "I enjoy chatting with other users. Basically it's an on-line 
community."

 Both KBBS and the Annex provide several channels where users can engage in 
live trivia games, group conversations or private chats. There are public 
discussions where users post questions or comments covering topics that range 
from horticulture to Howard Stern. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers can obtain games, spreadsheet and word-processing programs, and even 
buy products from an on-line shopping service. Subscribers can also send 
electronic mail to others, including anyone outside the system who has an 
address on the Internet, the worldwide computer network. 
</P>
<P>
 For the proprietors, however, making bulletin boards into profitable 
businesses is no easy feat. Gooden, a former office manager, logs 18-hour days 
surrounded by an array of computers, monitors and technical reference manuals. 
And even though his board is relatively successful -- with 2,000 active users, 
it generates about $7,000 a month in subscription revenue -- all the profits go 
back into the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles is probably the most competitive market in the country," Gooden 
said. "If you want your board to survive, you've got to keep upgrading the 
system." The Annex has just expanded its phone bank and can now accommodate 72 
callers simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, experts believe that only about 5% of all bulletin board systems 
are profitable, while 15% break even and the rest lose money. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Higgins, who runs the BrainStorm bulletin board in Simi Valley, knows the 
financial challenges well. 
</P>
<P>
 "After four years . . . I haven't come close to breaking even," Higgins said. 
"Last year BrainStorm grossed $7,000. But I spent $14,000 upgrading and adding 
new features." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the 32-year-old Higgins has a full-time job as an engineer with 
MagneTek, a defense subcontractor in Simi Valley. He's been tapping his 
paycheck to subsidize his bulletin board, which he launched after trying 
various on-line services and finding their quality disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I could put together a more user-friendly setup," he said. To get 
started, he spent $2,000 on an IBM clone PC and another $800 on software, 
modems and two telephone lines he had installed at his home. He now has eight 
lines and will soon add eight more. 
</P>
<P>
 But though BrainStorm has 630 regular callers, only 180 are paid subscribers, 
and Higgins says he needs 80 new subscribers each month to break even. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't mind dipping into my own pocket to improve the system," 
Higgins said. "I'm convinced that the BBS industry has a big future, and I want 
to be a part of it."

VONS WILL CLOSE POORLY PERFORMING UNITS IN CALIFORNIA; SUPERMARKETS: 350 
EMPLOYEES WILL BE AFFECTED AS THE STRUGGLING CHAIN CONTINUES ITS RESTRUCTURING 
PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a bid to reverse declining sales in California's highly competitive 
supermarket business, Vons Cos. plans to close nine poorly performing 
California stores with nearly 350 employees by Aug. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The store closings, confirmed Friday by Vons, will bring to 17 the number of 
supermarkets closed since the Southland's biggest food chain announced a 
restructuring plan in November. Vons has also eliminated 250 administrative 
jobs under the restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts said Vons has been forced to retrench in order to compete on 
prices with such aggressive supermarket chains as Lucky Stores, Food 4 Less 
Stores and Ralphs. They said Vons' problems stem from the uniquely tough market 
in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vons is a victim of geography," said Jonathan Ziegler, an analyst at Salomon 
Bros. in New York. "They'd be doing a lot better if they weren't in Southern 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the November announcement, Vons has monitored sales at all of its stores 
to determine which it should close. The nine-store shutdown is one of the 
largest multiple-store closings in the local supermarket sector in recent 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of closures exceeds the target of 11 stores announced in November. 
However, Vons will also have opened seven new, more efficient stores in 
California by the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "More stores failed to meet our financial criteria than expected," said Mary 
McAboy, a Vons spokeswoman. "The closings allow us to redirect money into new 
stores that can generate a better return for the company." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the targeted stores, six are in Southern California and three are in the 
central part of the state. One of the affected stores -- a Vons in Tulare -- 
closes today at 6 p.m. The remaining stores will be shut down at 6 p.m. Aug. 
13. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southland stores on the closing list are in San Bernardino, Hacienda 
Heights, Rialto, Rancho Palos Verdes, Fallbrook and Victorville. The remaining 
two stores are in the central California communities of Santa Maria and Arroyo 
Grande. 
</P>
<P>
 That will leave Arcadia-based Vons with 320 stores in California and 15 in 
Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 Vons said some employees at the targeted stores will be offered jobs at other 
stores, based on seniority and union contracts. Vons has not yet indicated how 
many people will be offered transfers, but the company said employees who 
accept the offers could displace workers with less seniority. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the new stores will replace outlets being closed. The Arroyo Grande 
store to be closed will be replaced in 1995 by a supermarket twice its size. 
Likewise, Vons plans to replace its targeted Fallbrook supermarket with a 
larger store in that community in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 McAboy said the new, larger stores attract more consumers. Vons has already 
opened four new stores in 1994 and plans to open four more later this year. The 
company last year decided to close under-performing stores and use the cost 
savings to build new ones and cut prices in hopes of stemming its dramatically 
declining sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Vons has not yet reversed its fortunes. Sales for the six months ended June 19 
slipped 2.7% to $2.304 billion compared to the same period last year. The 
decline in same-store sales -- revenue from stores open at least 12 months -- 
was steeper. Earnings for the latest six-month period tumbled more than half to 
$13.5 million, from $33.6 million.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; GOOD JOBS NEWS PUTS WALL STREET IN GLOOMY MOOD; MARKETS: 
BOND YIELDS RISE, WHILE STOCK PRICES AND THE DOLLAR WEAKEN. FEARS OF A HIKE IN 
INTEREST RATES ARE BACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 News that the economy added more than a quarter of a million jobs last month 
triggered a sharp rise in Treasury bond yields Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The gloomy mood in bonds spread to other financial markets, weakening stock 
prices and the dollar. Behind the selloff were renewed fears that the Federal 
Reserve Board will act to contain inflation arising from the employment 
strength by pushing up interest rates as early as Aug. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 The key 30-year bond yield jumped to 7.54% from 7.40% on Thursday. Its price, 
which moves in the opposite direction, plummeted 1 13/32 points, or $14.06 per 
$1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average slid 18.77 points to 
3,747.02, down 17.48 for the week. 
</P>
<P>
 The markets reacted swiftly to the Labor Department's morning report that the 
economy created 259,000 new jobs in July, about 60,000 more than consensus 
forecasts and besting even the highest expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 The long bond's yield immediately surged, reflecting a swift reversal in 
sentiment from recent hopes that economic growth had slowed markedly in the 
second half of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond market's shortest-term maturities suffered even sharper setbacks, 
with yields on six-month and one-year Treasury bills jumping about a fifth of a 
percentage point. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally disturbing was a closely watched wage gauge in the report, the hourly 
earnings of non-farm, non-supervisory workers, which jumped 0.4% to $11.12 in 
July. 
</P>
<P>
 The markets have been concerned that higher labor costs could prove 
inflationary. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the report increases the likelihood that the Fed will raise 
interest rates as much as 0.5% at its next Federal Open Market Committee 
meeting in an attempt to slow economic growth and head off any increase in 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond rates move in anticipation of such hikes because of the need to offer 
competitive returns to investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly it's strong enough to make the Fed seriously consider it, coupled 
with other things," said Bill Newman, chief investment strategist at Kidder 
Peabody. 
</P>
<P>
 Back on Wall Street, market declines were widespread. Declining issues 
outnumbered advancers by nearly 12 to 7 on the New York Stock Exchange, and 
broad market indexes fell. 
</P>
<P>
 The NYSE's composite index fell 0.77 point to 252.50. The Nasdaq index of 
mostly smaller companies declined 1.51 points to 718.67. The Standard & Poor's 
500 list fell 1.31 points to 457.09. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Board volume was a moderate 230.27 million shares, down from 289.15 
million Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Utility stocks, which had rallied over the past several weeks, were hit 
particularly hard amid fear that rising interest rates would prove expensive to 
utilities, which typically borrow heavily in the credit markets. The Dow Jones 
utility average lost 1.91 points to close at 189.43. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors sold the issues of economically sensitive companies, such as 
smokestack industrial stocks, and interest-sensitive companies, such as banks 
and mortgage-related companies, on the fear that higher interest rates will 
choke off investment. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Caterpillar fell 2 7/8 to 104 3/4, even after shareholders approved a 
2-for-1 stock split effective Tuesday. International Paper declined 1/2 to 74 
3/8. Morgan Stanley lost 1 3/8 to 62 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Telecommunications equipment company Scientific-Atlanta surged 4 3/4 to 39 
after its quarterly earnings soundly beat analysts' forecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nextel Communications jumped 1 1/8 to 26 3/4 in Nasdaq trading on news that 
it reached a merger deal with Dial Page Inc. and was buying Motorola Inc.'s 
remaining U.S. specialized mobile radio licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dial Page slipped 1 3/8 to 30 5/8 and Motorola finished up 1/8 to 52 5/8. 
The news boosted other wireless communications stocks, including OneComm, which 
rose 1 5/8 to 26 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fund American Enterprises Holdings climbed 3 7/8 to 74 7/8 after it said it 
received an unsolicited bid for its Source One Mortgage Service Corp. 
subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, in the currency market, the dollar followed bond prices lower. 
</P>
<P>
 A rate hike could benefit the dollar by attracting short-term deposits from 
Europe, where rates are higher, but those positive implications were offset by 
the selloff in U.S. securities markets, which dampened demand for dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 In late New York trading, the dollar fell to 1.581 German marks, down from 
1.588 on Thursday. It also fell against the Japanese yen, closing at 100.25 
yen, down from 100.38. Overseas markets were mixed, and the Dow Jones world 
stock index was lower near the close. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, stocks rose to their highest level in six months amid growing 
optimism that the economy is healthier than people thought, traders said. The 
Bolsa index rose for a sixth session, up 2.72%, or 70.06 points, to 2643.87. 
</P>
<P>
 Equities also ended firmer in London, with the Financial Times 100-share 
average rising 17.0 points to 3,167.5, while Frankfurt's 30-share DAX average 
closed up 1.40 points at 2,184.76. Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average ended down 
155.14 points at 20,521.70.

NEXTEL PLANS 2 NOTCHES FOR ITS WIRELESS BELT; COMMUNICATIONS: DEALS WITH DIAL 
PAGE AND MOTOROLA WOULD SECURE ITS NATIONWIDE PRESENCE IN THE BURGEONING 
INDUSTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In deals that would cement its nationwide presence in the burgeoning wireless 
communications field, NexTel Communications Inc. said Friday that it will merge 
with Dial Page Inc. and buy all of Motorola Inc.'s specialized mobile radio 
licenses, two stock-swap transactions valued at a total of $2.4 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The deals are the latest in a string of aggressive moves by NexTel, a provider 
of specialty mobile radio services. With the backing of equity investor MCI 
Communications, NexTel is now positioned to become a major force in a new 
generation of mobile communications technology that officials say will 
dramatically change the way Americans communicate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's anywhere near a good appreciation of the potential of 
wireless" communications, said Morgan E. O'Brien, NexTel's chairman. "The 
people who are making the huge bets (on wireless technology), and the bets we 
are making, . . . are not crazy. What people don't realize is how these 
products will change the way you live." 
</P>
<P>
 By gobbling up Greenville, S.C.-based Dial Page -- which provides mobile radio 
services in much of the Southeast -- and the Motorola radio licenses, NexTel is 
eliminating potential competitors and filling big gaps in its wireless coverage 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 NexTel's specialized mobile radio service provides wireless communications 
over a portable hand-held device that uses a portion of the airwaves once 
employed mainly by taxi dispatchers. It works on different frequencies than 
cellular telephones and is among the leaders in using digital technology to 
provide clearer circuits and greater capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Rutherford, N.J.-based NexTel, formerly called Fleet Call, began buying up 
mobile radio licenses last year. In February, MCI announced it would invest 
$1.3 billion in NexTel to enable the firm to expand nationwide. NexTel also 
announced recently the purchase of OneComm Corp. of Denver for more than $650 
million and the acquisitions of 22% of Mexican wireless provider Corporacion 
Mobilcom for $165 million. 
</P>
<P>
 NexTel and its big ally are girding for battle with AT&T, whose $12.6-billion 
acquisition of McCaw Communications, the nation's largest cellular phone 
provider, was recently approved by the Justice Department. NexTel says that in 
1996 it will become the first company to offer digital wireless services 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Wireless communications services are already one of the fastest-growing 
segments of the $300-billion telecommunications industry. Yet the increasingly 
mobile American work force and the proliferation of ever-more-powerful portable 
computers is fueling even more demand for always-in-touch communications. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's just tremendous pent-up demand for wireless services," said Mark 
Lowenstein, director of wireless mobile communications for the Yankee Group, a 
Boston-based consulting firm. "Ten years into cellular, we already have 17 
million subscribers for a service that doesn't work all that well and has 
tremendously high prices." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, NexTel's generous deal -- together with the stunning $833 million 
investors bid for government licenses last month for the right to offer new 
wireless communications services -- has some analysts worried that companies 
may be reaching too deep into their pockets to get into a business that remains 
unproven. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prices are becoming stratospheric," said Richard Nespola, who heads the 
Leawood, Kan.-based telephone consulting firm Management Network Group Inc. 
"Things have absolutely gotten out of hand." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, NexTel -- which earlier this year began offering wireless 
communications in Los Angeles and a few other California cities -- could pose a 
serious threat to the cellular telephone industry and get the jump on new 
wireless technologies such as personal communications services. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of the two agreements, Dial Page shareholders would receive 
about 28 million shares of NexTel stock, worth about $750 million. Motorola, 
one of the nation's leading makers of electronic communications equipment, 
would get 62 million NexTel shares -- worth nearly $1.7 billion -- for its 
radio licenses and related specialized mobile radio properties, giving it a 22% 
stake in the company. Nextel Communications Inc. at a Glance * Headquarters: 
Rutherford, N.J. * Chief executive: Wayland R. Hicks * Employees: 1,000 * Major 
services: Provides wireless communications using a variety of specialized 
mobile radio frequencies. * 1994 revenue: $67.9 million * 1994 loss: $56.9

TEAMSTERS TARGET SAM'S CLUB IN FULLERTON; LABOR: IT MARKS THE FIRST EFFORT BY A 
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA UNION TO TAKE ON A STORE OWNED BY DISCOUNT GIANT WAL-MART. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Teamsters local is trying to organize workers at the Sam's Club in 
Fullerton, marking the first attempt by a union in Southern California to take 
on a store owned by discount giant Wal-Mart. 
</P>
<P>
 The nation's largest retailer, a longtime opponent of organized labor, has 
successfully defeated all efforts to unionize its stores, which include about 
430 discount food warehouses named after the late Sam Walton, the Arkansas 
businessman who founded Wal-Mart. 
</P>
<P>
 But Teamsters Local 952 in Orange, which has 12,000 members, says it has 
signatures of support from most of the 140 warehouse and clerical workers at 
the Fullerton Sam's, a former Pace Membership food store that Wal-Mart bought 
late last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on that, the local is asking the National Labor Relations Board to hold 
an election. A hearing on that request is set for later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor observers say a victory would be significant against a company that, as 
it expands in the Southland, is a threat to the heavy union organization of the 
region's grocery industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would be a great inroad," said Michael Byrne, a spokesman at the AFL-CIO 
in Washington, which has long had a contentious relationship with Bentonville, 
Ark.-based Wal-Mart. 
</P>
<P>
 Hector Gonzales, general manager of the Sam's store, said in a brief 
statement, "We do not believe a majority of our associates want to be 
represented" by the union. He and other Wal-Mart representatives would not 
comment further. 
</P>
<P>
 Teamsters officials said management recently spurned their request for 
immediate recognition, which would have enabled the union to avoid a formal 
election. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the many signatures from workers, the Teamsters are not assured of 
keeping employee support through the election, especially if Sam's launches an 
anti-union campaign, as is expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Some workers say they will continue to back the Teamsters, though, because of 
concerns about job security and cuts in pay and hours. "We're all just kind of 
worried," said Corey Costantino, a seven-year warehouse clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 Unions across Southern California, especially those trying to protect their 
turf in the highly organized supermarket industry, will be closely watching the 
Teamsters' effort. The growing presence of non-union warehouse clubs have cut 
into grocery sales at regular markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The United Food and Commercial Workers union has campaigned hard over the 
years to keep Wal-Mart, which has tiptoed around the edges of the state's 
heavily populated areas, from opening stores in Burbank, Simi Valley and other 
Southland sites. 
</P>
<P>
 But late last year, Wal-Mart bought 91 Pace stores from Kmart, including 21 in 
California, giving the retailer an entry into the lucrative Southern California 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Diamond, a spokesman at the United Food and Commercial Workers Local 777 
in Los Angeles, which has contracts with big supermarket chains, said he isn't 
sure the Teamsters can succeed at organizing the Fullerton Sam's. If they do, 
he said, "it will definitely be a step in the right direction for the whole 
labor movement."

 Consumer Debt Piles Up: Despite signs that spending is slowing, Americans are 
continuing to accumulate debt.The Federal Reserve Board reported that consumer 
credit rose in June for the 15th straight month, climbing 15.6% at an annual 
rate. Borrowing increased at a 16.6% annual rate in May and 14.9% in April, the 
Fed said. Borrowing increased $10.9 billion in June after rising $11.5 billion 
the previous month. Consumer credit includes all household debt not secured by 
real estate, namely home equity loans and mortgages. Analysts said the 
continued borrowing growth may temper projections that the economy is slowing 
dramatically.

FCC PUSHES AUCTION WINNERS TO HONOR BIDS; COMMUNICATIONS: SOME WHO SOUGHT 
LICENSES ARE ASKING FOR EXTENSIONS OF THEIR PAYMENT DEADLINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE MILLS, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal regulators moved Friday to crush an organized effort by some winners 
of last week's auctions of communications licenses to delay making good on 
their bids. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Communications Commission sent a strongly worded "alert" to tell 
all winners that there would be no exceptions to a 3 p.m. Monday deadline for 
making 20% down payments on their licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's notice came after the winner of 20 licenses, a St. Petersburg, 
Fla., firm known as Commercial Realty St. Pete Inc., urged other winners to ask 
the FCC jointly to delay the down payment deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 The auctions, the first in federal history, won pledges of far more money than 
experts had expected. But the Treasury has yet to collect the money, and 
Friday's action by the companies, many of which are small start-up ventures, 
reveal the uncertainties of this licensing method. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have concerns about technology and other obstacles which have surfaced 
since the auctions," James C. Hartley, president of Commercial Realty St. Pete, 
said Friday in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, companies pledged $214 million for 594 local and regional licenses 
that would allow television viewers to use home shopping, banking and other 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Hartley and his engineers visited the Reston, Va., firm Eon Corp., 
the only company developing the equipment that would be needed in the services, 
according to Eon President Michael Sheridan. 
</P>
<P>
 After the meeting, Hartley faxed a letter to other winners, complaining that 
Eon was far from ready to deliver the technology needed for the services, 
according to Greg McCauley of Philadelphia, another winner. He said Friday that 
between 50 and 60 other winners then expressed interest in making a joint 
request to the FCC for a payment delay. 
</P>
<P>
 Eon's Sheridan on Friday denied that there would be any delays in the 
technology. It will be ready in six months to a year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of unnecessary panicking going on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the FCC learned of the winning bidders' actions Friday, it issued a 
warning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We understand that some winning bidders have been encouraging other winning 
bidders to delay their down payments," the FCC notice said. "Encouraging other 
winning bidders to default would be an abuse of the commission's processes and 
may violate the antitrust law or other federal laws." On Friday, Hartley and 
the other bidders backed off.

STOCK SURGE SHATTERS RECORDS IN SHANGHAI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a spectacular turnaround that shattered every record on Shanghai's 
roller-coaster stock market, investors Friday unleashed another buying wave 
that sent the index soaring by 108.50% for the week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Shanghai Class A share index for domestic investors surged 22.31% on 
Friday to 700.58 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Its twin on the market in the southern Special Economic Zone of Shenzhen added 
10.52% to 165.92. 
</P>
<P>
 Share prices began rocketing Monday after Beijing announced a freeze on market 
growth this year and put forward a package of reforms that included a proposal 
to allow foreign funds into Class A shares for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas funds are now restricted to the much smaller hard-currency Class B 
share markets. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Shanghai's B-share market was up 2.46% to 74.40 points and 
Shenzhen's added 2.44% to 107.04. 
</P>
<P>
 While the announcement itself merely confirmed half-promises already made to 
investors, swamped by a tide of new issues this year, it was taken as a signal 
that Beijing was determined to rescue the stock markets, which have become 
crucial to China's modernization plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanghai's A-share index had plunged 80% since its high last year and the 
Shenzhen index had dived by 75%, raising fears of a complete collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Many brokers dismissed Monday's 36.14% gain in Shanghai as the work of large 
brokerages manipulating the index for short-term profit. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the surge continued, it became clear that small investors, who drove 
trading during the raging bull market of late 1992 and early 1993, were back in 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, turnover in Shanghai hit an all-time record $1.2 billion. 
Turnover Friday was only fractionally lower at $1.199 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Brokers said investors had pulled funds out of bonds and bank accounts and 
poured cash into the Shanghai stock market, indicating the start of another 
sustained rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds replaced shares as the favorite investment vehicle this year as the 
stock markets bombed. Bank accounts have been padded because of rising interest 
rates.

USAIR REJECTS INVESTMENT PROPOSAL FROM PILOTS; LABOR: UNION OFFERED WAGE 
CONCESSIONS FOR PART OWNERSHIP. THE COMPANY SIGNALS IT WILL STILL TALK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 USAir rejected its pilots union's offer of wage concessions in return for part 
ownership. But the financially ailing airline suggested Friday that it is 
willing to continue talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "While some aspects of . . . (the Air Line Pilots Assn.) proposal offer 
hopeful prospects for future negotiations, a number of provisions are 
unacceptable," the airline said in a statement from its Arlington, Va., 
headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 ALPA, which represents 5,200 USAir pilots, offered Wednesday to swap $750 
million in wage concessions in return for partial employee ownership of the 
airline. 
</P>
<P>
 USAir described the savings as illusory because they included future salary 
and longevity increases. 
</P>
<P>
 "The net result is that actual savings fall far short of what is needed, even 
before considering the financial benefits the pilots are seeking in return," it 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said any concessions must be based on April, 1994, levels if the 
airline is to remain "a viable competitor." 
</P>
<P>
 The ALPA proposal, which also called for $1.75 billion in concessions from 
other USAir unions, was rejected Thursday by the Assn. of Flight Attendants. 
Other USAir employees are represented by the International Assn. of Machinists 
and the Transport Workers Union. 
</P>
<P>
 ALPA said its members make up 12% of the USAir work force and would shoulder 
30% of the labor cost reductions. 
</P>
<P>
 USAir also said it rejected ALPA's proposal of equal-percentage reductions in 
salaries for all employees regardless of income level, which it said "would 
cause lower-paid employees to subsidize higher-paid employees." 
</P>
<P>
 ALPA said its proposed concessions represent about 20% of the pilots' average 
$100,000-a-year salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The USAir statement also said the ALPA proposal "would largely disenfranchise 
USAir Group's common shareholders, who have already experienced a market loss 
in the value of their ownership." 
</P>
<P>
 "Additionally, under ALPA's proposal, the public common shareholders would 
have no voice in the selection of director nominees and little voting influence 
in the election of directors," it added. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing the proposal, Peter Gauthier, head of ALPA's executive council 
for USAir pilots, said, "This is an offer to invest and not an offer to buy." 
</P>
<P>
 But in its statement Friday, USAir contended that "in return for a minority 
investment, ALPA is seeking not only effective control over the governance of 
the company, but also dominant influence in the running of the business."

 Japan Trade Surplus Hits Record in First Half: The nation's giant current 
account surplus rose 2.2% to a record $68.78 billion in the first half of 1994, 
the Finance Ministry said, but economists say the surplus is on a downward 
trend in terms of volume and yen. "Exports are not growing much and imports are 
growing a lot, so in volume terms the surplus is on a shrinking trend," said 
Nobuyuki Saji, economist at Nikko Research Center.The Ministry said Japan's 
current account surplus -- the broadest measure of trade in goods and services 
-- widened to an unadjusted $11.11 billion in June from $10.61 billion a year 
earlier and $8.72 billion in May. The surplus in trade alone rose to a 
non-seasonally adjusted $13.11 billion in June compared to $11.48 billion a 
year earlier and $8.84 billion in May.

 Cox Cable Settles Complaint: The parent of Cox Cable, one of San Diego's two 
largest cable companies, with 300,000 subscribers, agreed to pay $7 million to 
settle a consumer complaint filed by the San Diego County district attorney's 
office for improper billing of late charges. Under terms of the agreement, Cox 
Cable Communications Inc. will refund $3 million in late charges assessed 
between 1992 and this month, pay $1 million in legal and investigative costs 
and alter late charges over the next three years to save consumers an 
additional $3 million, the district attorney's office said.

 Unitrin Inc. Warns Against Buyout: The company said it opposes American 
General Corp.'s $2.6-billion buyout offer, saying it would violate state and 
federal antitrust laws. Chicago-based Unitrin and American General both focus 
on selling life insurance door-to-door in middle- and low-income areas, a 
costly process that limits new entrants to the market, Unitrin said. American 
General is the largest so-called home-service insurer in the United States, and 
Unitrin ranks fourth in terms of premium volume among the companies that 
compete in the market, Unitrin said.

'MI VIDA LOCA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was reading about the movie "Mi Vida Loca" prior to Kevin Thomas' movie 
review ("The Road to 'Mi Vida Loca' Paved With Good Intentions," July 22).And I 
was poised to write. I wanted to express that the blight of society that this 
film depicts does not represent any large proportion of Latin society. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thomas says it sincerely in his closing paragraph. "More than anything 
else, 'Mi Vida Loca' makes the case for how important it is that ethnic and 
minority filmmakers get the opportunity to tell the stories of their own 
people."

DWIGHT AND THE REVIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While reading the July 25 review of Dwight Yoakam's performance ("Yoakam Lets 
Tunes Talk") once again I ended up shaking my head in disbelief and wondering, 
how do "critics" get these jobs? 
</P>
<P>
 In particular I'm referring to the comment, "His vaguely psychedelic ballad 'A 
Thousand Miles From Nowhere' recalled Roy Orbison's more contemplative side." 
Psychedelic? Roy Orbison? Psychedelic and contemplative? What?

BOWL ATTENDANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Contrary to the suggestion of Daniel Cariaga in his review ("Bamert Inspires 
Quality Performance," July 23), attendance is not down at the Hollywood Bowl 
this summer. Despite the oft-rehashed woes of our area, business at the Bowl is 
actually up 5% over last year.Subscriptions have held steady -- an improved 
trend contradicting industrywide experiences -- and single-ticket sales are 
increasing significantly for all events. In fact, we are projecting a record 
summer at the Bowl with our second year of million-plus attendance.  
</P>
<P>
 This clearly reflects both a great desire for music and a recognition that it 
can be found -- affordably and in the widest possible variety -- at the 
Hollywood Bowl. The Philharmonic is delighted with this achievement. We are 
proud of our artists and staff and happy that more people than ever are turning 
to L.A.'s music oasis for their summer art and entertainment.

MOVIE SALES SQUEEZE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding the summer films being "squeezed" at the box office ("A Squeeze Play 
Tags the Summer Box Office," Aug. 2): 
</P>
<P>
 Although history probably proves me wrong, I propose that one key to the 
monetary gross of a film is the quality of the film.But I wouldn't want to 
frighten the studios with that suggestion. Perhaps mediocre drivel gets the 
audience it deserves. At least we might see fewer sequels.

'PICKET FENCES' DESERVES A WRITING NOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From its Emmy nominations, the Academy of Television Arts & Sciences sent a 
message that there was not one drama series deserving recognition in the 
writing category other than "NYPD Blue" ("Emmys Take On a 'Blue' Shade," July 
22). That does not bode well for the future of commercial television. 
</P>
<P>
 Congratulations to the producers, writers, cast and crew of "NYPD Blue" on 
their record 26 Emmy nominations. However, in writing, there is a far more 
deserving drama series that was sorely overlooked: "Picket Fences." 
</P>
<P>
 Arguably one of the most topical and thought-provoking dramatic series in 
television history, each episode of "Picket Fences" challenges viewers by 
presenting real-life ethical dilemmas and issues while also provoking smiles, 
tears and laughs.

HOOKED ON THE '50S; SANTA ANA COUPLE ROCKS AROUND THE CLOCK WITH FURNITURE, 
CARS AND CLOTHES FROM THEIR FAVORITE ERA. THEY EVEN HAVE A NAUGAHYDE BAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY BRYANT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ricky Nelson biking home after school is the only 1950s element missing from 
the tree-lined Santa Ana street that Suzy and Buddy Dughi live on. 
</P>
<P>
 The small bungalows with their large front and back yards are reminders of a 
time when land was cheap in Southern California. And to the Dughis, the street 
is a living reminder of the time they wish they had grown up in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our yard still has orange trees in it from then," said Suzy Dughi, 25, "and a 
couple of blocks over there is a house with an orange grove on it. It must be 
one of the last left." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dughis wear '50s clothing and drive '50s-style cars and have filled their 
home with household items from the time period in which they feel so 
comfortable. Their home is not just a nod to the '50s: from its Formica-topped 
table to the geometric-print drapes, it is the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 "On this block there is a man about 85 years old who used to be a country and 
Western singer and played all around here in the '50s," said Buddy, 32. "He's 
really told us a lot about the history of this area. One of the Fender guitar 
people lived on this block too." 
</P>
<P>
 It was Buddy's love of rock 'n' roll and cars that got him interested in the 
'50s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cars of the time really got me," said Buddy, "and then the music and the 
guitars." He is a member of a hot-rod club, the Lucky Devils, and owns a 
restored '49 Mercury (Suzy drives a '57 Ford). One room of their house is 
dedicated to things automotive, with trophies, car plates, original movie 
posters from hot-rod films and other such memorabilia on display. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Buddy grew into collecting '50s things, so did Suzy. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was little I liked the music and the furniture with the spindly legs. 
I liked it, but I didn't know what it was. I had no influence from my parents 
since it was something they went through, but was no big deal to them," said 
Suzy. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 12 years ago when the Stray Cats came out with their '50s-inspired 
music, I began dressing in '50s clothes and did my room with furniture from 
then. When Buddy and I got together we started collecting stuff everywhere we 
could find it."  
</P>
<P>
 Luckily for the Dughis, when they started collecting, the '50s items were not 
yet as popular as they are now, so things were very cheap. The first end table 
they bought cost only $4, and other pieces were even cheaper.  
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the first items each bought before they knew each other were the 
small radios that now rest on a shelf in their living room. 
</P>
<P>
 In the house they're renting, the Dughis pulled up the carpeting and restored 
the hardwood floors. When they repainted, they kept the same soft greens and 
creams that had been there in 1954. 
</P>
<P>
 Draperies in the living/dining room area have a white background with 
geometric triangles in bright colors. The pattern is a typical one from 40 
years ago when technical design was first used around the home. 
</P>
<P>
 Importance was placed on streamlined furniture; chrome was used on cars, 
furniture and appliances; vivid colors like hot pink, turquoise and orange were 
the rage, and there was a vision of a new, egalitarian society on the horizon 
made possible through science and industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "I read in a book about the '50s that at that time more people could afford to 
buy more things than at any other time in history," said Suzy. "Things were 
priced so that the average person could afford to buy them." 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy's favorite piece of furniture is the bar in the living room. It was 
built in Australia in 1959 and features chrome, orange Naugahyde upholstery and 
a built-in light.  
</P>
<P>
 "I found it in a junk store and passed on it. It was $15. After two days of 
thinking about it, I went back and got it." 
</P>
<P>
 On top of the bar is Buddy's collection of cocktail shakers and glasses and a 
blue lava lamp. Behind it on the wall are two pictures of panthers in 
asymmetrical black wooden frames. The original $4 end table is in the living 
room along with another one that cost $100, evidence of how the look has caught 
on and raised prices.  
</P>
<P>
 On either side of the couch (in the '50s style but not an original) are 
Oriental lamps, the pair purchased for $25. Their shades look like the sails on 
a Chinese junk. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the fireplace is a '50s starburst clock. The space age-designed 
television in the corner still works, as do the four radios, one of them 
salmon-colored. A turquoise side chair is another favorite purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 In the dinette area, the Dughis have a chrome table with the original Formica 
top and metal base that was once used in a diner. Attached is a chrome brace to 
hold a menu. 
</P>
<P>
 Suzy collects salt and pepper shakers, and they're displayed on the built-in 
shelves in the kitchen. Their dishes are Franciscan ware from the '50s with the 
blue star design. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bedroom is a dressing table that Suzy got when she was 16. "It is '40s 
and more Art Deco, but I really like it and feel that someone living in the 
1950s might have had something like it in their home." 
</P>
<P>
 Completing the look are fake leopard-patterned draperies and bedspread and a 
landscape picture with an asymmetrical wooden frame. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're always looking for things," said Buddy. "If we find something, (to make 
room for it) we'll either sell what we have or give it to friends of ours who 
also collect." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes we just keep it and try to find room for it," said Suzy, with a 
laugh. "If it's neat, we'll buy it whether we need it or not." 
</P>
<P>
 "To us the fun of this collecting is to dig it up from places (where it's not 
valued) and buy it cheap. Anyone can go to stores and spend thousands of 
dollars and furnish a house top-of-the-line with this look. That's just great 
and that's not what we do," said Buddy. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Dughis are having to come to terms with the fact that the price of their 
favorite things is going up, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to buy dresses for $6," said Suzy, "but now, if I can find them, they 
can cost $40 and $50. And guys' things are really getting hard to find." Suzy 
thinks the women's clothes of the '50s were feminine and pretty, and she likes 
them much better than current fashions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dughis have more items that they keep stored in their garage and admit 
that they will eventually need a larger house to accommodate their collection.  
</P>
<P>
 'We want to have things that people living then would've had in their homes. 
When people think of that time, they think poodle skirts, but that's what kids 
wore," said Suzy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want store-bought, goofball things like bubble gum machines. We want 
real things that adults would have had," said Buddy. 
</P>
<P>
 Things like the pink plastic flamingos in the front yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Because even though the Dughis didn't grow up in the '50s, they figure 
nothing's to stop them from having the fun of living then.

GARDENING; TAKE A HEALTHY INTEREST AND GET TO THE ROOT OF WHAT AILS PLANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN DARDICK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Do you have plants that look like they are about to croak? As summer heat 
intensifies, plants are frequently stressed by scorching temperatures, lack of 
water and attacks by sucking or chewing insects.  
</P>
<P>
 If you pay attention to the symptoms, you can often act in time to restore 
plants to good health. But it's important to properly diagnose the ailment 
before reaching for a remedy. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, yellow leaves in plants can be one of the first signs of 
trouble. They can indicate stress from dry soil, insect attack or even 
overwatering in conditions where heavy clay soil is saturated with water, 
preventing oxygen from reaching the leaves. But some plants are merely going 
through a natural cycle of dropping older leaves while replacing them with new, 
green ones. 
</P>
<P>
 To determine what if any problem there is, it's important to dig for facts. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade Roberts regularly uses an eight-powered lens to search for signs of 
trouble. At Sherman Gardens in Corona del Mar, where Roberts is director, 
magnifying lenses are a routine gardening tool. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the staff and volunteers here are equipped with lenses," he explained. 
"It's amazing what you can see by studying the underside of plant leaves." 
</P>
<P>
 A lens, whether the sophisticated type used by botanists or a common 
magnifying lens, reveals if insects are feeding on leaves and, if so, what type 
they are. This simple method of detecting is one of the first steps in nursing 
ailing plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Some insects can simply be washed off plants with the spray from a garden 
hose; some require a more concerted effort. If you discover damaging insects 
but are unable to identify them on your own or determine what to do, take a 
contained sample with you to a nursery or botanical garden for assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 "There really are only a handful of problems," Roberts said. "Learn to 
identify what's wrong with the plant before taking any action." 
</P>
<P>
 He points out that often, in their zeal to correct the problem, people make it 
worse by jumping to the wrong conclusion and the wrong solution. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most common problems plants and lawns endure in summer is 
overwatering or under-watering. 
</P>
<P>
 First test the soil to determine if it's dry. 
</P>
<P>
 There are inexpensive soil probes available commercially, but many expert 
gardeners use an even simpler method: pushing a finger several inches into the 
soil to check for moisture. Use a trowel or shovel if you need to check more 
than several inches deep. 
</P>
<P>
 Watering daily as a summer routine is a waste of water and money and can cause 
even more problems. Most landscapes and container plants need to dry between 
waterings. Otherwise, soil fungi can attack plant roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Rico Montenegro, assistant director of the Fullerton Arboretum, advises paying 
attention to plants and landscape when they're healthy so you can prevent 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Know the overall appearance of your plants," he urges. "Plants give signals 
before they start wilting, and the first is loss of color. A deep green plant 
looks duller. A lawn changes color and isn't as resilient." 
</P>
<P>
 Other summer ailments include improper fertilization and battering by Santa 
Ana winds. 
</P>
<P>
 "When plants are under stress, it's important not to fertilize them, since 
that stresses them even more," Montenegro counseled.  
</P>
<P>
 "The people who love their plants to death do that literally by overwatering 
and overfeeding them so they produce succulent, tender green growth in the 
height of summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then the temperatures rise or the winds start to blow, and these are the 
first plants to get stressed." 
</P>
<P>
 Give your plant first aid. N2

CONSTRUCTION; COST OF KIT JUST PART OF FINANCING FACTORY-MADE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're considering buying a factory-built home, bear in mind that coming up 
with the cash for a manufactured house -- be it a log home or modular structure 
-- can be more complicated than getting a mortgage on a house you'd buy through 
a real estate agent. 
</P>
<P>
 Before you even begin talking to lenders, you should know that you will have 
to raise cash to cover more than just the materials supplied in the 
manufacturer's kit. 
</P>
<P>
 You also must finance what the factory doesn't provide -- such as plumbing, 
electricity, heating and cooling systems and interior details, such as cabinets 
and improvements to the site (water and septic systems). 
</P>
<P>
 For example, site preparation work, such as cutting and removing trees, 
grading the lot, excavating a foundation, drilling a well and installing a 
septic system can easily run $10,000 to $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 If you use a general contractor who builds the entire house, including hiring 
subcontractors to do electrical, plumbing and other work, you can add another 
$30,000 to $50,000 to the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't forget to add the cost of shipping the package to your site. A rule of 
thumb here is about $2 per mile for each truck, and many homes require two 
truckloads. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the actual costs you incur will depend on the size of the house you 
buy, the quality of materials and the amount of site work needed. A good rule 
of thumb is that a completely finished ready-to-move-into house will cost you 2 
1/2 to three times the cost of the basic package. 
</P>
<P>
 That means that 1,700-square feet log-home kit that sells for about $40,000 
can actually wind up costing anywhere from $100,000 to $120,000 finished. This 
includes the cost of site preparation but not the cost of the land itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is possible to finance the land as well as the rest of the house, 
the whole process goes a lot more smoothly if you already own the land. In most 
cases, the land amounts to the homeowner's equity in the project -- the money 
you put up front, much like the down payment on a regular mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 Many mortgage companies and banks have no real system for financing a 
factory-built home. Generally speaking, you will probably need two loans -- a 
construction loan and a home mortgage. The construction loan will provide the 
cash you need for the kit itself, site improvements and the other expenses you 
incur along the path from manufacturer's package to a complete home. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the house is finished, the construction loan will be paid off and 
replaced by a long-term mortgage -- the same type of loan you would use to buy 
a conventional home. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, you will get these loans from separate lenders. Very few home 
manufacturers offer financing.

OBSERVE SYMPTOMS, DIAGNOSE PROBLEM, APPLY TREATMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN DARDICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Summer's heat and dry conditions subject plants and lawn to a variety of 
problems. Here are some common plant ailments and some first-aid techniques you 
can try to help them: 
</P>
<P>
 * Leaves at base of plant turn brown, then fall off. 
</P>
<P>
 Diagnosis: Look at underside of leaf with magnifying glass. If tiny little 
spots appear, the problem is spider mites. Or shake the leaf over a white piece 
of paper. Spider mites will scurry away. 
</P>
<P>
 Treatment: Wash undersides of leaves with water for at least three days. 
Spider mites drown easily. Promote good air circulation by not crowding plants 
in landscape or removing thick foliage or stems from center of plants. If 
untreated, entire plant can quickly lose all its leaves. Roses are especially 
likely to be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 * Leaves turn yellow and then fall off. 
</P>
<P>
 Diagnosis: Examine soil and entire plant. Yellow leaves can be a symptom of 
overwatering. It can also be a sign of nutrient deficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 Treatment: Soil should dry between waterings. Allow plant time to recover and 
sprout new leaves before fertilizing. 
</P>
<P>
 * Leaves are brown around the edges and look scorched. 
</P>
<P>
 Diagnosis: Scorched leaves can be a sign of sun scald. 
</P>
<P>
 Treatment: Evaluate entire plant and its location. If the plant is in the 
ground, it may be receiving too much direct sunlight. Cover with shadecloth. If 
the plant is in a container, move to an area of less intense sunlight. 
</P>
<P>
 * Leaves are wilting. 
</P>
<P>
 Diagnosis: Improper watering. Put your finger in the soil to determine how 
moist the soil is. If the top few inches are dry, water. 
</P>
<P>
 Treatment: Water thoroughly so water reaches plant roots. If plants are in 
containers, immerse containers in water until bubbling stops. Or let water 
slowly soak through entire plant so entire rootball is wet. 
</P>
<P>
 * Leaves have holes in them. 
</P>
<P>
 Diagnosis: Insects are munching on them. Large holes, entire leaves or 
sometimes flowers missing can mean grasshoppers have moved in. Examine the 
plant and surrounding area to determine what type of insect is at work. 
</P>
<P>
 Treatment: If the problem is grasshoppers, spray landscape with a commercial 
product such as Grasshopper Attack. Alert your neighbors because grasshoppers 
can infest an acre or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Other insects also chew leaves. If the damage is more than you find 
acceptable, spray with commercial insecticidal soap according to product 
directions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Water runs off the soil surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Diagnosis: Look at the soil surface. Is it hard and caked? Take a trowel or 
shovel and dig down a few inches. Is it easy to work the soil? If not, the soil 
is crusted and water can't penetrate to the plant roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Treatment: Cultivate the soil to break up the crust. Add a layer of mulch, 
four to five inches thick, to shade the soil and plant roots, improve water 
retention and reduce weeds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Despite regular care, plants in containers still don't look right. 
</P>
<P>
 Diagnosis: Check size of container in proportion to plant. Is the top growth 
larger than the container? Look underneath. Can you see roots emerging? Pull 
the plant out of the container. Are the roots a thick, coiled mass? 
</P>
<P>
 Treatment: Shoulder and shift. Remove the plant from the container. Trim back 
rootball from bottom and edges. If the plant is still in scale with the 
container, repot with fresh potting soil. But most likely, it's time to shift 
the plant to the next largest size container. Water well to thoroughly wet 
potting soil and root ball. 
</P>
<P>
 * You water regularly, but plant leaves look yellowish-green or even yellow. 
</P>
<P>
 Diagnosis: Lack of fertilizer 
</P>
<P>
 Treatment: Use a commercial liquid fertilizer, according to package 
directions. Be sure plant soil is moist before fertilizing. Never fertilize a 
plant stressed by lack of water or excessive temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 * Grass is dull and crunches when walked on. 
</P>
<P>
 Diagnosis: This is usually the first sign of stress from lack of water. Probe 
the grass to check how dry the soil is.  
</P>
<P>
 Treatment: If it is dry, water deeply and infrequently. Water a few times a 
week, for at least 15 to 20 minutes, depending on type of grass. Adjust mower 
blades so grass length is longer in summer to conserve water. Remove thatch 
build-up so water can penetrate. 
</P>
<P>
 * Brown patches in lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Diagnosis: Uneven watering or insect infestation. Check watering system to be 
sure lawn is evenly irrigated. If watering isn't the problem, take a sample of 
affected lawn to a local nursery for assistance in identifying what is. 
</P>
<P>
 Treatment: If lack of water is the problem, adjust irrigation system. If 
insect infestation is occurring, treat accordingly. Some pests, such as chinch 
bugs, are controlled by a naturally occurring fungus that develops in moist 
soil and can be controlled by keeping a lawn well watered. KAREN DARDICK

A HELPING HAND: INSIDE & OUT; BLACK AND WHITE OF REPAINTING ROOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Q. Our teen-ager has moved out of our house for college, and I'm planning on 
turning his bedroom into a den. Two years ago though, we let him paint his room 
black. How do the walls have to be prepared before I paint them white? 
</P>
<P>
 G.D., Garden Grove 
</P>
<P>
 A. If you do it right, you'll just need to apply two coats of a primer to hide 
the black, says Harold Brobst of Hal's Paint & Decorating in Fullerton. For the 
walls, assuming a flat black paint has been used, you can use a simple latex 
primer. If the woodwork in the room has been painted with an oil-based top 
coat, you may need to use an oil-based primer, or one of the water-based 
primers designed to coat oil-based paints. After you let two coats of the 
primer dry, you should be able to use whatever color top coat you want to 
lighten up the room. 
</P>

 Q. I have an old gasoline-powered edger I use about every three or four weeks 
that works fine. However, a neighbor told me I shouldn't leave gasoline in its 
tank when it's not in use because as gasoline gets old, it breaks down and gums 
up the engine. Is this true? 
</P>
<P>
 S.S., San Juan Capistrano 
</P>
<P>
 A. Old gasoline is not good for an engine, says Patrick Kim of McLean's 
Lawnmower Service in Ora.nge. This applies to any gas-powered equipment. If 
you're not going to be using the equipment for a couple of weeks or more, it's 
probably a good idea to drain the gas tank, then refill it with fresh gasoline 
just before you use it. Try to get an idea of how much gasoline you use to 
complete your job so you're not having to drain a lot out afterward. 
</P>

<P>
 Q. We'll be putting new carpeting in our house soon, and I had an idea to 
solve one of our telecommunications problems. The phone jack in our den is at 
the complete opposite side of where we like our phone to be. Instead of putting 
a jack on the other wall, can't we just feed the phone line under the new 
carpeting? 
</P>
<P>
 R.C., Brea 
</P>
<P>
 A. Yes, that's an easy way to solve most problems like that, says Doug Welch 
of A-Z Wholesale Electrical Supply in Anaheim. Normally, you don't run any kind 
of electrical wiring under a carpet, but there's not enough voltage in the 
phone line to create a fire hazard. Have the carpet installers take care not to 
pierce it on the tack strip, and it's probably best to lay it under the pad 
rather than just under the carpet. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Q. We recently bought a home that has central air and heat. Over the past few 
months we've noticed that there seems to be a lot of dust on our furniture 
after the air has run for a while. Someone told us this could be the result of 
the ducts being dirty. What's the best way to clean them? 
</P>
<P>
 L.L., Anaheim Hills 
</P>
<P>
 A. Unfortunately, it's not a job that most homeowners can handle, says Joel 
Gwartz of B.J. Discount Plumbing & Heating Supply in Garden Grove. There are 
firms that specialize in cleaning ducts and they use unique vacuums to reach 
into the ducts. The problem usually occurs when dust and dirt are drawn up into 
the system through a dirty or ill-fitting filter, then the dust is forced 
through the ducts back into the house. This is one of the reasons you need to 
regularly check and replace your filter. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Q. When I turn on my shower, it takes so long for the hot water to get 
upstairs. Is there a way to make the plumbing route shorter so that I'm not 
wasting so much water? 
</P>
<P>
 C.O., La Palma 
</P>
<P>
 A. As for shortening the distance the hot water has to travel, generally your 
plumbing has been installed to take the shortest route when the house was 
built, says plumber Andrew Miller of Santa Ana. You can install a water heater 
upstairs, or, you can also put in a recirculating pump, which keeps hot water 
running through the system so it's hot whenever you turn the faucet on.

 Is your home office in the doldrums? Bringing it to life can be almost as 
simple as hitting the return key on your personal computer. Consider the 
following: 
</P>
<P>
 * Computer Mouse Art 
</P>
<P>
 Ever wanted to own a Van Gogh? A Monet? The Mona Lisa? 
</P>
<P>
 You can turn your mouse pad into a masterpiece with Gallery MousePads by 
Manticore Products of Chicago. Using soy ink, reproductions of Leonardo da 
Vinci's Mona Lisa and signature pieces such as "Irises" by Vincent Van Gogh and 
"Water Lilies" by Claude Monet are embossed on the pads, which are 8 by 9 1/2 
inches. 
</P>
<P>
 Other designs include a cup of steamin' joe and an antique-looking map. 
</P>
<P>
 Manticore Products, which also has a line of wrist rests, was founded by 
Vincent Cobb, a former painter, computer salesman and software developer. The 
company is at work on some new designs, including one with a golf motif.  
</P>
<P>
 The pads (about $19 each) are available at Nordstrom stores in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rest Easy at the Terminal 
</P>
<P>
 You can pull up to your home computer in a stylish as well as ergonomically 
designed chair. 
</P>
<P>
 The Catalina chair, distributed in Orange County by Adair Office Furniture in 
Santa Ana, is not only comfortable, but it also is available in many fabrics -- 
including paisley, stripes and florals. The material is stain-resistant, a boon 
for families with young children or those who are always spilling their 
favorite snack or beverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the chair's features are fully adjustable arms, back and seat pan, with 
easy-to-maneuver levers. The seat pan, which is made of a reinforced plastic 
that is stronger than the usual plywood ones, is connected to a gas cylinder 
that works as a shock absorber to help relieve spine problems. 
</P>
<P>
 The chairs, priced from $200 to $300, were introduced to the market about six 
months ago. For more information, call Adair at (714) 557-5726. 
</P>
<P>
 * Framing the screen 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes all you need to do is change your frame of reference. 
</P>
<P>
 Screenies gives you more than 50 ways to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
 Made of a sturdy cardboard, Screenies computer screen frames (about $8) are 
attached with Velcro to monitors. They fit all standard monitor sizes, up to 21 
inches. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to a tiger, the Sonoma-based company features zebra and graffiti 
patterns, flowers, farm animals, fish, astronauts and a television that looks 
like it is straight out of the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, if you're a chocolate aficionado, only something sweet will do. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider resting your wrists on foam pads (about $4) that sport wrappers that 
look like Reese's peanut butter cups and Hershey bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Screenies and the candy wrapper wrist rests are available throughout Orange 
County, including Computer City stores.

LIGHTING; WIPE THE GLARE OFF OF TV SCREEN WITH PROPER USE OF BLINDS, LAMPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many people prefer to watch movies in a theater rather than on video because 
the big-screen picture is more impressive. Another advantage movie theaters 
have over home theater systems is that there isn't an annoying screen glare, 
which seems unavoidable in a home setup. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a more comfortable home viewing atmosphere can be achieved through 
some simple observations and strategic lighting. 
</P>
<P>
 First, monitor the room's natural light. Even at night, few windows are 
completely dark. Covering windows with thick curtains not only keeps out the 
light, but also will cut down on reflections. Blinds can also be very 
effective. Horizontal blinds should be turned up rather than down to reduce 
invading light rays. 
</P>
<P>
 Although total darkness does obliterate the glare, it also impairs the ability 
to see the remote control and could cause eyestrain. A home theater should have 
just enough light to eliminate the potential for this problem. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the best lighting configurations involves placing a small light, 15 
watts or less, behind the television. Aim the light toward the wall behind the 
television to produce diffused, bounced illumination that will balance out the 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
 With any light source present, a glare can easily hit the screen from 
reflections off glass objects such as coffee tables and framed pictures. If you 
discover such a glare, move the offending objects. 
</P>
<P>
 Because every room is different, there's no systematic way to properly light a 
home theater. Nonetheless, a bit of ingenuity in the placement of lights will 
produce effective results for picture quality and viewer comfort.

FURNISHINGS; FROM BAUHAUS TO OUR HOUSE TO CRAFT MUSEUM IN NEW YORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA MAYER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 20th Century is winding down, and decorative furnishings from the first 
half of the century are well on their way to becoming antiques. Chief among 
pieces considered museum classics are those that came out of the Bauhaus, 
including Breuer chairs and the Jena teapot. 
</P>
<P>
 This small design school was organized in 1919 by architect Walter Gropius at 
Weimar, Germany. It moved to Dessau and then to Berlin, where it closed in 
1933. Although short-lived and not particularly successful at home, the Bauhaus 
has had worldwide influence on home furnishings development, Ursula Ilse-Neuman 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Ilse-Neuman is curator of "Bauhaus Workshops: 1919-1933" at the American Craft 
Museum in New York. On display in the exhibit marking the 75th anniversary of 
the Bauhaus founding are 85 famous and lesser-known objects made at the school 
or manufactured from prototypes designed there. 
</P>
<P>
 The creation of finished products at the school is noteworthy because 
designers prior to Bauhaus typically sketched their ideas and handed them to an 
engineer to make the working drawings or to a craftsman or artisan to build. 
</P>
<P>
 The school set what would become the standard method of teaching design, with 
separate workshops for researching new materials and technologies and for 
working with wood, metal, clay, fiber and glass. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitler's Germany was not hospitable to the ideas or the designers, whose ranks 
included leftists, freethinkers and Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the leading lights of the school -- Gropius, Ludwig Mies van der Rohe, 
Marcel Breuer, Anni and Josef Albers and Laszlo Moholy-Nagy among them -- 
emigrated to the United States and dispersed, carrying their ideas with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Gropius taught at Harvard, and Josef and Anni Albers taught at Black Mountain 
College in North Carolina and later at Yale University. 
</P>
<P>
 "In retrospect, the furniture workshop may have been the most important 
workshop," Ilse-Neuman says. "It revolutionized the way homes are furnished." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Bauhaus furniture deviated from the ornate, heavy pieces that were the 
norm. 
</P>
<P>
 Breuer, who was in charge of the furniture workshop, devised tubular steel 
chairs with flexible seats and backs that were both light and strong. His 
Wassily chair of 1925 is believed to be the first to use tubular nickel-plated 
steel. 
</P>
<P>
 Breuer and others also tackled the concept of ergonomics, or how furniture and 
the human body work together. They experimented with standardized furniture 
with interchangeable parts and designed space-saving items such as nesting 
tables. 
</P>
<P>
 In the textiles workshop, the cover for Breuer's tubular steel chair was 
created for durability. Called "eisengarn," or iron yarn, the fabric is cotton 
yarn treated with wax and paraffin. 
</P>
<P>
 Anni Albers developed light-reflective and soundproof materials, and weavers 
created tapestries in abstract modern-art designs. 
</P>
<P>
 The glass workshop experimented with heat-resistant glass. The Jena teapot, 
clear with a glass infuser, a glass coffee maker and modular glass refrigerator 
storage containers are among items on view at the museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the differing points of view of Bauhaus members turned out to be 
prophetic. Some, especially Hannes Meyer, the Swiss architect who became the 
Bauhaus director in 1928, "emphasized the designer's social responsibility to 
provide low-cost, well-designed objects for the common man," according to 
Ilse-Neuman. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, she says, such as Mies van der Rohe "incorporated formal perfection 
and costly finishes in manufactured objects." 
</P>
<P>
 Still others, notably Johannes Itten, trained students to express themselves 
in unique ways. Which of these three strains of modernism is most important is 
still argued today. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bauhaus members were not the first or the only modernists," Ilse-Neuman 
says. "But they are the most forceful and the best known, perhaps because they 
had to leave Germany. The uniqueness of the Bauhaus lay in the extraordinary 
group of artists assembled by Gropius. It was their genius and personality that 
shaped the character of the institution and its students." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Bauhaus exhibit continues through Oct. 9 at the American Craft Museum, 40 
W. 53rd St., New York, NY 10020. Open Tuesday from 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. and 
Wednesday through Sunday from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Admission is $4.50 for adults, 
$2 for seniors and students, free to children under 12.

DECORATING; STYLES FIT FOR A QUEEN; VICTORIANA, ONCE THOUGHT RIDICULOUS, REIGNS 
AGAIN IN RUGS, FABRICS AND KNICKKNACKS OF MODERN PARLORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERTA GRAFF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She reigned for more than 60 years, filling the thrones of Europe with her 
heirs, and the parlors and drawing rooms of her time with a grace and style of 
living that was known as Victorian. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Old Queen" created a mood as well as an era. Victorian values were based 
on the sanctity of home and family, and whether one lived in a simple cottage 
or a Renaissance Revival mansion, a man's house was indeed his castle. For 
generations, American interest in Victoriana has swung in and out of favor. It 
seems to peak when we are overcome with nostalgia and filled with a longing for 
things past. Right now, Victoriana is fashionable. 
</P>
<P>
 Things that could scarcely be given away a few years ago are being searched 
for, revived and relished. Junk shops are scavenged and Grandma's attic is 
again being explored. Oddities previously dubbed silly, if not downright 
ridiculous, are sought with unrivaled passion. 
</P>
<P>
 Fanciful Victorian fretwork, stained-glass windows and marble mantels are 
being snatched from the wrecker's crane and reinstated in country cottages and 
urban apartments. And for the time being the "Gingerbread" era has been 
welcomed back. 
</P>
<P>
 Huge Queen Anne houses are no longer considered Victorian monstrosities but 
rather architectural jewels with towers, turrets and gables. Their interiors 
boast heavy wood paneling, decorative hardware and monumental staircases with 
newel posts and gracefully turned balusters. 
</P>
<P>
 Gothic Revival cottages, complete with Italianate verandas and cupolas, and 
original Victorian floor plans still exist for those choosing to re-create an 
authentic Victorian milieu. But the exuberance, warmth and charm of Victorian 
living can be obtained more easily and less expensively with reproductions of 
Victorian plaster moldings and ornamentation, a few well-chosen pieces and 
personal accessories. 
</P>
<P>
 A fashionable Victorian drawing room of 1850 would be eclectic in style, 
furnished with heavily carved, massive chairs, elaborately ornamented inlaid 
tables, mahogany chests with turned legs, and a bit of Queen Anne; or perhaps a 
piece or two echoing the English fascination with the French style of Louis XV 
with its deep narrow moldings. 
</P>
<P>
 It would also not be surprising to find a high-backed well-upholstered fringed 
sofa, a pointed Gothic chair, an upright piano, a black walnut whatnot shelf 
and, of course, an inlaid tea table perched on a luxurious Oriental carpet. 
Soft layered draperies would cover the windows and tables; watercolors would 
grace the walls, and surfaces would be covered with a melange of bibelots, 
quirky little objects and mementos. 
</P>
<P>
 House plants would be tucked into every nook and cranny, from huge palms to 
Boston ferns. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Victorian purists favor authentic furniture, most of us would prefer to 
create a 19th Century aura without sacrificing modern comforts and 
conveniences. It is possible, with the wealth of Victorian-style reproductions 
and authentic pieces available, to achieve the vintage charm of an era when 
"home was a haven." 
</P>
<P>
 The opulence and luxury of flower-strewn fabrics and new carpets with a 
time-worn look are available. Bayberry Inc. recently introduced "Melanie," an 
exclusive cabbage-rose print based on a 19th-Century French painting, and 
Karastan is designing Oriental-style carpets that help set a Victorian mood. 
</P>
<P>
 Imported from England are original Staffordshire Comforter dogs produced from 
1840 to 1900 and based on Queen Victoria's own spaniel, along with papier-mache 
tea tables, old needlework, twisted candlesticks, bamboo whatnot stands and a 
unique collection of desk accessories, picture frames and glass and silver 
biscuit barrels. 
</P>
<P>
 English Spaniels are also being reproduced as bookends and box lids by Fitz & 
Floyd, which also shows "Blushing Rose," a collection of bowls, planters, 
vases, teapots, picture frames and additional accessories of satin-finished 
bone china with pale pink roses that were inspired by Queen Victoria. 
</P>
<P>
 The Victorians were passionate about nature, and in many homes prints of 
plants in elaborate frames hung from the walls. Easily obtainable, old and new 
botanical lithographs echo the Victorian revival. Antique pieces in new 
handmade French mats are available as well as exact reproductions of the 
Vilmorin garden vegetable series first published in 1885, the popular 35-image 
Great Flower Prints and the series, "A Dozen Roses," among the top 
Victorian-flavor decorating prints available today. 
</P>
<P>
 The passion for frills and fancy was carried over to every aspect of Victorian 
life. Family celebrations took on the aura of coronations, but no occasion was 
handled with quite the pomp and circumstance of a Victorian wedding. 
</P>
<P>
 When Queen Victoria married her beloved Albert, not a detail was overlooked; 
the wedding cake, it was reported, was as elaborate as the regal bride and her 
surroundings. The sweet summit of the royal nuptials weighed 300 pounds and was 
decorated with roses and cupids, topped by an ice sculpture of Britannia. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was their fourth daughter, Princess Louise, whose wedding confection 
literally took the cake. This three-tier extravaganza was festooned with roses, 
shamrocks, thistles, cornucopias, baskets of fruits and flowers and monogrammed 
shields. It was crowned with a vase of flowers and silk banners edged in 
silver. Each tier of the cake was bordered with trellis work and studded with 
pearls. 
</P>
<P>
 Victoriana was opulence, but it was also fun. It was the era of Punch and Judy 
and Lewis Carroll, amusing trifles, children's toys, gentility and an 
appreciation of the past. It was a life filled with pretty things: vases of 
flowers, bits of lace and the philosophy that for every space there is an 
object. 
</P>
<P>
 The ambience can be captured in a contemporary setting by reinterpreting the 
ornamentation, the innovation and the colorful sense of Victorian design. 
</P>
<P>
 Listen carefully -- amid the cozy splendor, you can almost hear the taffeta 
rustle.

 Are your household papers a hopeless mess? 
</P>
<P>
 A home filing system is easy to establish, and you will really appreciate it 
when you need to find documents in a hurry. 
</P>
<P>
 A two-tiered system that separates your papers in active files and long-term 
storage files is usually best. It gives you ready access to current, routinely 
needed material while keeping valuable papers secure. 
</P>
<P>
 Organize the active file first. Keep in it all the papers that you accumulate 
and need during the current year. 
</P>
<P>
 They include receipts and other records necessary for figuring taxes, bank and 
credit card statements, current insurance policies, employee benefit data, 
medical correspondence, children's report cards, warranties and owners' manuals 
for appliances and papers relating to home and automobile maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 To create the file, gather all the papers and documents that need to be filed, 
along with file folders, labels, pens or pencils and an empty wastebasket. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrange the papers and documents in a pile. Pick up the topmost item and 
decide whether it has any value to you. If it doesn't, throw it away and go on 
to the next item. If it does, choose a folder heading for it, label the folder 
and slip in the item. 
</P>
<P>
 For most household filing systems, labeling by subject is usually the most 
suitable method. Subject files are flexible; you can always retitle, subdivide 
or consolidate folders as necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Continue by picking up each successive item in the stack and going through the 
same procedure. As you go along, you'll find that many items will fit into 
existing folders rather than require new ones. Keep the contents of folders in 
chronological order by placing material with the most recent date near the 
front. 
</P>
<P>
 Include a folder marked "Miscellaneous" and a "To File" folder for material 
you can't file right away. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrange the folders in alphabetical order and store them in a file cabinet, 
desk drawer or sturdy carton where they are easily accessible. 
</P>
<P>
 As you go through the stack, make a separate pile of any important papers or 
documents that require long-term or permanent storage or are difficult to 
replace. 
</P>
<P>
 Utility shelves and large cartons with tops make good in-house storage. You 
can place accordion folders in them to preserve tax returns and financial 
records that must be kept until their statutes of limitations run out. 
(Currently, tax returns should be kept for six years.) 
</P>
<P>
 You should also include folders corresponding to those in the active file. 
Each year, at tax time, sort through the active file and transfer any material 
that is no longer current but that you do not want to throw away into the 
long-term storage file. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep valuable and difficult-to-replace documents in a bank safe-deposit box, 
safe or fireproof strongbox. These include birth and marriage certificates, 
passports, securities, property records like mortgages, deeds and titles, a 
photocopy of your will (the original should remain with your lawyer), and an 
inventory of valuable items in your home, such as jewelry and collectibles. 
</P>
<P>
 Do not keep life insurance policies or deeds to burial plots in a safe-deposit 
box. Safe-deposit boxes are often sealed by court order when the box holder 
dies and this can render the documents inaccessible.

MATERIALS; CARPET LAYS GROUNDWORK FOR INSULATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN S. SALADYGA, TIMES-POST NEWS SERVICE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite changing tastes in home decor and design, carpeting has remained a 
mainstay. Of all flooring materials, carpeting accounts for more than 75% of 
the market. 
</P>
<P>
 Its popularity stems from the fact that it gives a plush, comfortable feel 
underfoot, dampens sound, insulates cold floors and hides ugly ones.  
</P>
<P>
 As popular and widespread as carpeting is, though, buying it puzzles many 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 The first thing you have to know to buy carpeting is how much you need. To 
find an approximate amount, measure the length and width of the floor in feet 
and multiply those two numbers. Since carpeting is sold in square yards and not 
square feet, divide that number by nine; this will give you the square yardage. 
Then add about 10% for waste and odd room angles. Ultimately, let the dealer 
make the final measurements (most insist on doing so, anyway) to get the 
precise amount. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, you need to decide what type of carpeting is appropriate for a given 
room. Ask yourself if there will be heavy or light traffic and what type of 
look and feel you want. 
</P>
<P>
 Carpeting comes in a number of constructions and texture. The most common are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Level-loop pile: This construction consists of yarns that form loops of 
equal height, with both ends of the loop anchored in the backing. These carpets 
provide long-lasting durability and generally are used in high-traffic areas, 
such as family rooms and hallways. Berbers are level-loop pile carpets. 
</P>
<P>
 * Multilevel-loop piles: These are built the same as level loops, but the 
loops are of two or three different heights to create patterns. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cut pile velvets (also called plushes): Take a level-loop carpet, cut off 
the top of the loops, and you have a plush. It's the kind of deep, smooth 
carpet in which you can see your footprints. Used mostly in light-traffic areas 
such as bedrooms to add a lush, luxurious touch. 
</P>
<P>
 * Saxonies: Made the same way as a velvet, but the yarns are twisted. It's not 
as lush as a velvet, but its construction makes it more versatile and usable in 
a variety of rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cut and loop pile: A combination of cut and looped yarns that provide a 
variety of textures, including sculpted effects, and durability. 
</P>
<P>
 About 97% of carpeting made in the United States is made of synthetic fibers. 
The four basic types are: 
</P>
<P>
 * Nylon: Accounts for most of the fibers used in carpeting in the United 
States. It's wear-resistant and resilient enough to bounce back from the weight 
of people and furniture, making it good for all rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 * Olefin: Wear-resistant, strong, resists static electricity and mildew. 
</P>
<P>
 * Polyester: Noted for its soft, luxurious feel in thick-pile carpeting. It 
cleans easily and is resistant to water-soluble stains. 
</P>
<P>
 * Acrylic: It offers the look and feel of wool without the price. It has low 
static-electricity levels and is moisture- and mildew-resistant. Commonly used 
in velvet piles. 
</P>
<P>
 Wool is the fifth fiber used in carpeting. It is soft, luxurious and durable, 
but costly. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to construction and fiber content, another factor that affects 
carpet appearance and durability is density, which refers to the amount of yarn 
used. 
</P>
<P>
 One way to judge density is to bend back the carpet and see how close the 
individual tufts of yarn are to each other and how much of the backing is 
exposed. A high-density carpet will reveal lots of yarn and little backing. 
</P>
<P>
 Another way to determine density is to press a finger against the carpet and 
observe how easily it penetrates to the backing. The easier it penetrates, the 
less dense the carpet is. 
</P>
<P>
 As for carpet cushions, the firmer the better. A good cushion increases a 
carpet's comfort and extends its life by absorbing the impact of foot traffic. 
</P>

 BETTER LIVING: One sure sign of economic recovery: Millionaires are living 
better. Sales of million-dollar homes in California picked up nearly 10% during 
this year's second quarter, says Dataquick Information Systems of La Jolla. 
Dataquick spokesman Donald L. Cohn notes that houses are selling "often close 
to their asking prices." In Orange County: 39 million-dollar homes were sold, 
compared to 31 the same quarter last year. Newport Beach alone had 24, third in 
the state to Beverly Hills and Bel-Air. 
</P>
<P>
 DROP IN THE BUCKET: Some 30,000 Garden Grove residents will soon get back $4 
each -- they were overcharged on their water bill. It may be tiny -- it's a 
one-time-only rebate -- but then, how often do you ever get back anything from 
government? . . . . The rebate is the result of the city learning it would not 
have to pass on to customers an anticipated increase from the Orange County 
Water District. Industrial customers in the city get $54 back, commercial users 
$26.

 CHUCK ROAST? The Los Angeles Rams, who open their exhibition season today 
(C1), are coming off their fourth straight losing year (5-11). But the annual 
pro football preview magazines see some Rams hope. . . . Street and Smith says: 
"By himself, running back Jerome Bettis makes the Rams worth watching." Inside 
Sports predicts the Rams will finish second to San Francisco in the NFC West. . 
. . Athlon Football sees the Rams improving, but pokes a little fun at the calm 
demeanor of Coach Chuck Knox (above): "He never lets controversy, or even a 
silver lining, get in the way of a dull quote."

 EMPTY PARK: If you've finally made up your mind to see "Jurassic Park" this 
weekend -- you blew it. "Jurassic Park" has been playing on a movie screen 
somewhere in Orange County since June 9, 1993 -- a local record -- but finally 
ran out of steam this week. . . . But if you can wait a few weeks, video stores 
will be flooded with copies on Oct. 4.

U.S. ECONOMY GROWS DESPITE JOBLESS RATE RISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STUART SILVERSTEIN and ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's unemployment rate edged up to 6.1% in July from 6% in June, the 
government reported Friday, but the slight rise masked a vigorous gain in 
employment that ignited investor fears of renewed inflation and raised the odds 
of the Federal Reserve Board boosting interest rates again. 
</P>
<P>
 California's jobless rate climbed more sharply, rising to 9% last month from 
8.3%, as the state's sluggish economy continued to lag behind the nation and 
produced skimpy job increases. In Los Angeles County, the unemployment rate was 
10%, down from 10.1% in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, analysts and investors focused on a stronger-than-expected gain of 
259,000 jobs last month in the closely watched survey of employer payrolls. 
Also suggesting robust economic growth were increases in both average hourly 
and weekly earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 The job gain is "a very healthy increase and what it says is that businesses 
are still catching up with the fact that they didn't do any hiring for so 
long," said Cynthia Latta, an economist with the consulting firm of 
DRI/McGraw-Hill in Lexington, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 But Latta, echoing concerns on Wall Street about the prospects for inflation, 
said "there's got to be pressure out there pretty soon in the job market for 
higher wages." 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street over the past week had focused on reports suggesting that the 
nation's 3-year-old economic recovery was slowing slightly. Consequently, 
investors began anticipating that the Federal Reserve would not raise interest 
rates soon. But based on today's reports, investors "changed their minds 
again," Latta said, and turned their attention to the Fed's upcoming Aug. 16 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond prices fell more than one point, pushing up yields on 30-year Treasury 
bonds to 7.54% from 7.4% late Thursday. The Dow Jones industrial average 
dropped 18.77 points to close at 3,747.02. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, employers have added a hefty 2 million jobs to their 
payrolls, a strong surge that is encouraging more people to enter the labor 
force. One side effect of the influx of job hunters, though, was the jobless 
rate rose last month even as many new jobs were being generated. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month's job gain was down from the 356,000 increase in June but the July 
total, economists said, was held down by such factors as the strike at Peoria, 
Ill.-based Caterpillar Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 During July, the economy showed its biggest gains in services and retail 
trade, with restaurants, supermarkets and furniture stores all reporting 
increases. More workers also were added by temporary employment agencies, one 
of the fastest growing segments of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton proclaimed that "the future looks good," alluding to 
employment figures during a Rose Garden ceremony marking the first anniversary 
of Congress' passage of his deficit-reduction program. Clinton said his program 
"helped drive those interest rates down and got this economy moving again." 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans dissented. "The truth of the matter is, the President inherited a 
good economy when he came in," Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) told 
reporters, adding: "All he had to do was make sure he didn't mess it up. The 
economy is continuing to look fair but it's not running wild." 
</P>
<P>
 California's jobless rate remained the highest among the 11 big states whose 
employment figures were released Friday. North Carolina posted the lowest rate, 
4.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the relatively small sampling on which the state figures are based, 
California's jobless rates often are volatile. And even with last month's 
increase to 9%, it remains well below the 9.6% rate in April and the 1994 high 
of 10.1% in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists generally considered the state employment figures mediocre, but 
there was enough ambiguity in the statistics for varying interpretations -- 
particularly by politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Gov. Pete Wilson called the increase in the jobless rate a 
"temporary statistical variation" caused in part by seasonal forces, such as 
students entering the job market. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that "trends over the last several months have been moving in the 
right direction. We are encouraged in the fact that more people are seeking 
work," even though the rise in the number of job hunters helped push up the 
unemployment rate. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson's Democratic opponent in the Nov. 8 election, state Treasurer 
Kathleen Brown, said the disparity in figures nationally and for the state 
indicated to her that California "continues to be a drag" on the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to tell you I don't see it as a recovery," she said in an address in 
Long Beach to a group of women business executives. 
</P>
<P>
 The payroll survey showed a gain of 8,100 jobs in California during July, 
mainly in services and manufacturing. On the other hand, employment in retail 
and whole trade was down 3,500, and small declines were posted in three other 
industrial categories. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's figures reflect "a pretty flat economy," said Tom Lieser, an 
economist with the UCLA Business Forecasting Project. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's employment reports provide further evidence that California's 
disastrous economic slide since mid-1990 has "bottomed out," Lieser said, "but 
we'd like to see more snap to the recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Gibson, an economist for the state Department of Finance, said other 
economic indicators show that the state's actually is doing better than 
Friday's employment figures suggest. 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed to strong gains recently in the state's retail sales and payroll 
taxes, along with the continued strength of the housing market despite recent 
increases in home mortgage rates. "We're moving ahead," he said. "Not as 
rapidly as we'd like, but we're moving ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson also said he was encouraged that the state's economy has been adding 
jobs lately despite continuing cutbacks in U.S. defense spending that have 
devastated California's aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Friday's figures included downward revisions in job totals 
for both May and June. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, even with the job increase in July, the latest figures show 
California's employment as being down 8,100 over the last three months since 
April and up only 6,800 since the end of last year. By some estimates, the 
state's job total is still down by more than 800,000 since employment peaked in 
mid-1990.

FISKE OUSTED IN WHITEWATER CASE; MOVE IS SURPRISE; INVESTIGATION: FEDERAL 
THREE-JUDGE PANEL NAMES KENNETH STARR AS NEW SPECIAL COUNSEL. SWITCH IS SEEN AS 
PROLONGING PROBE. THE ACTION STUNS CLINTON'S ADVISERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA FRITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The controversial Whitewater criminal investigation took a surprising turn 
Friday when a three-judge panel replaced special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. 
with Kenneth W. Starr, solicitor general under former President George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 The move stunned President Clinton's advisers, who had asked the court to 
reappoint Fiske under the terms of a newly enacted independent counsel law that 
had lapsed when the investigation began more than six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 At the White House, Counsel Lloyd N. Cutler issued a terse statement saying 
that the President will continue to "cooperate fully" with the investigation 
into allegations that Clinton may have benefited from money funneled to the 
Whitewater Development Corp. from a now-defunct Arkansas savings and loan owned 
by James B. McDougal, his investment partner in the Whitewater real estate 
venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, although the three-judge panel said that it needed to replace 
Fiske to assure the independence of the investigation because he had been 
chosen by the Clinton Administration, the switch actually could heighten the 
partisan nature of the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 While both Fiske and Starr are Republicans, Starr is widely viewed as a more 
partisan choice because of his service under Clinton's 1992 political opponent 
and because he is said to have given legal advice to the lawyers for Paula 
Corbin Jones, the woman who is suing Clinton for alleged sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, lawyers involved in the case predicted that the switch in 
investigators will delay the conclusion of the investigation, perhaps forcing 
Clinton to defend himself against embarrassing conclusions closer to the 1996 
presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only problem with this is the time it's going to take . . . " said 
Clinton political adviser Bob Shrum. "The frustrating thing here is that this 
will probably delay it some weeks or months." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior White House official, who declined to be identified by name, said the 
President's aides believe that they are being treated unfairly, facing "a kind 
of double jeopardy" with the switch to a second prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of his appointment by the court, Starr has wide-ranging 
authority to either accept all of the work that Fiske has done so far or to 
begin the investigation over again. Lawyers involved in the case predicted that 
he would keep on some of Fiske's appointees to ensure continuity. 
</P>
<P>
 The setback for Clinton comes at a time when he is suffering the effects of 
unfavorable publicity generated by nearly two weeks of Whitewater hearings in 
Congress, which have focused on questionable contacts between the Treasury 
Department and the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans, who have been critical of Fiske's approach, immediately applauded 
the choice of Starr. Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa, the President's leading Republican 
critic on Whitewater, praised the choice of Starr, whom he described as a man 
of "impeccable credentials and stature." 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Eastland, a former Republican Justice Department official who worked 
with Starr, said that the White House should view Starr's appointment as a 
plus. "If he clears him," he said, "that's the best news Clinton could have." 
</P>
<P>
 Starr, 48, now an attorney in private practice, is high on the Republicans' 
list of possible future appointees to the Supreme Court. He has served on the 
U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington as well as having been solicitor general. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Gilbert Davis -- who represents Jones in her suit alleging that 
Clinton, when he was governor of Arkansas, lured her into a hotel room and 
asked her for oral sex -- told The Times that Starr had offered to draft an 
amicus brief supporting his defendant's right to sue the President. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Starr declined to comment but he told a PBS interviewer "that 
it's a very serious step" to argue, as the President has, that he is above such 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske came under fire from Republicans recently when he concluded that the 
death last summer of former Deputy White House Counsel Vincent Foster was a 
suicide, not a murder, and that the controversial White House-Treasury 
discussions violated no law. Some Republicans, such as Rep. Dan Burton of 
Indiana, still think that he may have been wrong on both counts. 
</P>
<P>
 The court's order does not explicitly empower Starr to reexamine the death of 
Foster as Fiske's charter did but it does give him authority to investigate any 
future allegations that the Administration might have tried to interfere with 
the Whitewater criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans also objected to the role that Fiske played in helping Democrats 
delay until next year congressional hearings into central allegations in the 
Whitewater case and to the deference that he has shown for the Clintons, the 
Foster family and others ensnared in the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the court's decision, Fiske, a prominent New York attorney, 
issued a statement saying that it had been a privilege to serve as independent 
counsel. "I wish Ken Starr the very best," he said, "and will do everything I 
can to help him with a speedy and orderly transition." 
</P>
<P>
 Starr, who was attending an American Bar Assn. meeting in New Orleans, could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Atty. Gen. Janet Reno had asked the court to reappoint Fiske, the 
judges said they had concluded that to choose an investigator favored by the 
Administration "would not be consistent with the purposes" of the newly 
re-enacted law providing for independent investigations of alleged crimes 
involving the President or his top appointees. The independent counsel law was 
re-enacted earlier this year and signed into law by Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "This reflects no conclusion on the part of the court" that Fiske lacks either 
the actual independence "or any other attribute necessary to the conclusion of 
the investigation," the judges wrote. "Rather, the court reaches this 
conclusion because the act contemplates an apparent as well as an actual 
independence on the part of the counsel. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "As Fiske was appointed by the incumbent Administration, the court therefore 
deems it in the best interest of the appearance of independence contemplated by 
the act that a person not affiliated with the incumbent Administration be 
appointed." 
</P>
<P>
 For those same reasons, Reno initially resisted Republican demands for an 
Administration-appointed prosecutor on grounds that, lacking a law giving him 
the independence of being a court appointee, his findings would never be fully 
accepted by Clinton's critics. But she eventually yielded to the pressure and 
selected Fiske. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, she recalled that she had hoped the independent counsel law would 
be re-enacted earlier, before she was forced to appoint a Whitewater 
investigator. 
</P>
<P>
 The court invested Starr with the "full power, independent authority and 
jurisdiction to investigate to the maximum extent authorized" by the new law 
possible violations of law relating to the relationship of the Clintons and 
McDougal and his now-defunct savings and loan.

Justice Department for a criminal investigation. Madison was owned by James B. 
McDougal, he Clintons' business partner in Whitewater Development Corp. The RTC 
says money might have flowed from Madison Guaranty to the Whitewater 
development and Clinton's gubernatorial campaign in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 18: Justice Department renews its interest in Foster's suicide because of 
media speculation that he was alarmed about the Whitewater scandal to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Dec. 23: Clinton tells his personal lawyer to turn over all Whitewater 
documents to the Justice Department, including files from Foster's office. It 
is later learned this was done under a negotiated subpoena to keep the 
documents sealed from the public, press and Congress. The first of 10 boxes of 
files are delivered two weeks later after being 'catalouged.' 
</P>
<P>
 Jan. 12, 1994: Clinton directs Atty. Gen. Janet Reno to name an independent 
counsel to probe the Whitewater affair after congressional Republicans clamor 
for a special congressional committee to mount an investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan. 20: Reno names New York lawyer Robert B. Fiske Jr. as special counsel to 
conduct a wide-ranging criminal investigation into Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 Feb. 25: Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman reveals that he briefed White 
House officials on the RTC's investigation of Madison Guaranty. It is later 
learned that there were three meetings between White House and Treasury 
officials, all involving Nussbaum, plus unknown numbers of phone calls and 
hallway conversations. 
</P>
<P>
 March 4: The FBI subpoenas 10 White House and Treasury officials who took part 
in the meetings to testify before the grand jury and bring any related 
documents. The White House freezes all memos and computer files so nothing will 
be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 March 5: Nussbaum is ousted by Clinton. His resignation is effective April 5. 
</P>
<P>
 March 8: Clinton names attorney Lloyd N. Cutler, an influential old Washington 
hand with political savvy, as temporary White House counsel to help him through 
the Whitewater mess. 
</P>
<P>
 March 9: Fiske meets with Senate Republicans, says he continues to oppose 
hearings into the controversy. Republicans indicate their willingness to delay 
hearings until late May or early June, but majority Democrats, who ultimately 
will decide whether to schedule hearings, hold fast to their position that the 
probe should be left to a special counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 March 22: Democratic leaders of House back off earlier opposition to possible 
Whitewater hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 June 12: The Clintons interviewed under oath by Fiske about Whitewater, 
including Foster's death. 
</P>
<P>
 June 21: Senate votes to hold Whitewater hearings. House also plans hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 June 29: The Clintons set up legal defense fund for mounting legal bills from 
Whitewater and sexual harassment lawsuit filed against the president by Paula 
Corbin Jones, a former Arkansas state clerk. Clintons limit donations to $1,000 
from individuals only. 
</P>
<P>
 June 30: Fiske issues interim report on the Washington aspects of the affair. 
He finds Foster's death was a suicide unrelated to the case and says he will 
file no criminal charges over the White House-Treasury contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 July 26-Aug. 5: Congressional hearings. 
</P>

<P>
 INDEPENDENT COUNSEL LAW 
</P>
<P>
 The law requires the Justice Department to conduct a preliminary investigation 
if the attorney general receives "specific and credible" information alleging 
criminal wrongdoing by any of 60 senior executive branch officials, including 
the President. If that probe finds "reasonable grounds" to believe further 
investigation is necessary, the attorney general is required to ask a special 
three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals to appoint an independent 
counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 NEXT STEP: The court order takes effect immediately. Fiske said he would work 
with Kenneth W. Starr, who was named independent counsel Friday, for a "speedy 
and orderly transition," but one of his aides speculated that the investigation 
would be set back several months. If Starr decides to use Fiske's staff the 
transition would be more rapid.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Since actress Sharon Tate was slain in her Benedict Canyon home, at least 
18,335 people have been murdered in the city of Los Angeles. But no killers 
have become as notorious as the bizarre cult members responsible for the 
gruesome slaughter of Aug. 9, 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 While Tate's husband, film director Roman Polanski, was in Europe, the 
pregnant actress and four visitors were beaten, stabbed and shot. The word PIGS 
was scrawled on the front door in Tate's blood. 
</P>
<P>
 A wave of fear swept the city, heightened by the discovery the next day of 
store owners Leno and Rosemary LaBianca, who had been tortured and killed in a 
similar fashion in their Los Feliz home. 
</P>
<P>
 Only months later did the public hear of Charles Manson, a wild-eyed career 
criminal and his "family," runaways from middle-class life who lived with him 
on a remote San Fernando Valley ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a quarter of a century later, the names are chillingly familiar: Susan 
Atkins. Patricia Krenwinkel. Leslie Van Houten. Tex Watson. All are serving 
life terms in prison for the Tate-LaBianca murders along with their long-haired 
guru -- a wanna-be songwriter who hung around the fringes of the Los Angeles 
music scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now as he sits isolated in one of California's toughest prisons, Manson 
has gained a new mystique as a kind of criminal antihero. People play his 
songs, peddle his writings and sell his likeness on T-shirts and dresses for 
girls. Near the prison, at least one follower has taken up residence, waiting 
to see Charlie again. 
</P>
<P>
 For the relatives of Manson's victims, the past has proved difficult to 
forget. Some have devoted their lives to keeping Manson behind bars. Another 
has found God and forgiven her mother's killer. 
</P>
<P>
 One even has won reparations from Manson. 
</P>
<P>
 Bartek Frykowski was 9 years old and living in Poland when his father, Voytek 
Frykowski, a friend of Polanski's, was stabbed 51 times and shot at the 
Benedict Canyon estate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Manson destroyed my life really," Frykowski said from the German village 
where he lives. "Always this case was with me. I became a different man without 
a father." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally seeing results from a lawsuit filed more than two decades ago, 
Frykowski has received $75,000 in royalties for a song Manson wrote before the 
murders. "Look at Your Game Girl" was used by Manson to lure young hippie women 
into his fold. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Guns N' Roses recorded it on an album that has sold more than 2 
million copies worldwide -- with Manson's share of the profits going to 
Frykowski. 
</P>
<P>
 Frykowski said he is using the money to help give his two children the sense 
of security he never had, and he is writing a book about his father and Manson. 
He wonders how Manson's music could become popular -- and how a mass murderer 
could become a cult celebrity among young people in Europe and the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have a fascination with evil," Frykowski said. "But why do they think 
Charles Manson is their hero?" A Bloody Rampage and a Lone Survivor 
</P>
<P>
 William Garretson has spent most of the last 25 years trying to forget how 
close he came to becoming one of Manson's victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Garretson, then 19 and fresh from Ohio, served as caretaker and lived in a 
guest house on the Cielo Drive estate rented by Tate and Polanski. 
</P>
<P>
 On the night of Aug. 8, Garretson received an unexpected visit from Steven 
Parent, a hi-fi enthusiast he had met hitchhiking. After Parent left, Garretson 
stayed up until dawn, writing letters and listening to his stereo. 
</P>
<P>
 In the morning, the caretaker was awakened by three police officers pointing 
their guns and shouting at him to freeze. By his account, they knocked him to 
the ground, roughed him up and put him in handcuffs. Then they led him past a 
scene so grotesque it is etched in his memory: 
</P>
<P>
 The bodies of Frykowski and his girlfriend Abigail Folger -- heiress to a 
coffee fortune -- were lying on the lawn covered in blood, each stabbed dozens 
of times. In the driveway, Parent was slumped in his car, shot four times. 
</P>
<P>
 The police spared Garretson a sight just as horrible inside the house. Tate, 8 
1/2 months pregnant, had been stabbed repeatedly and was curled in a fetal 
position as if to protect her unborn son. Nearby, a bloody towel covered the 
head of hairdresser Jay Sebring, her former boyfriend, who had been stabbed and 
shot. The two were connected by a rope hung over a rafter and looped around 
their necks. 
</P>
<P>
 The police did not believe Garretson's claim that he had heard nothing during 
the night and they quickly arrested him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very gruesome," Garretson recalled in a recent interview, "and finding 
one person alive on the estate was surprising to the police." 
</P>
<P>
 Garretson was still in custody that night when the LaBiancas were tied up with 
lamp cords and stabbed to death in Los Feliz. "DEATH TO PIGS" and the 
misspelled "HEALTER SKELTER" were written in their blood on a wall and the 
refrigerator. A carving fork was protruding from Leno LaBianca's stomach, and 
the word "WAR" was cut in his flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 Garretson was freed the next day after he passed a polygraph test. But because 
police did not initially believe that the Tate and LaBianca cases were 
connected, he remained a suspect for months. 
</P>
<P>
 The sensational killings stunned and terrified Los Angeles. With the killer or 
killers on the loose, suspicion and paranoia ran wild. Frank Sinatra was 
reported to be in hiding. Mia Farrow did not attend Tate's funeral out of fear 
she might be next. Sebring's friend, Steve McQueen, began carrying a gun in his 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 Gun sales soared in Beverly Hills and the price of guard dogs jumped 
sevenfold. Off-duty police were hired to patrol private estates and security 
firms tripled in size. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you talk about the Manson case, you're talking about perhaps the most 
bizarre murder case in the annals of crime," said Manson prosecutor Vincent 
Bugliosi. "There was a lot of fear. People were canceling parties, canceling 
people from guest lists. The words printed in blood made it especially 
frightening for the Hollywood crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 After nearly four months of investigation, police linked the Tate and LaBianca 
slayings to Manson, who lived with his followers on the Spahn Movie Ranch above 
Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, Bugliosi proved that Manson ordered three followers to 
commit the Benedict Canyon killings: Charles (Tex) Watson, a former high school 
athletic star; Krenwinkel, a onetime Sunday school teacher, and Atkins, a 
former topless dancer who once sang in her church choir. Atkins, the jury 
learned, stabbed Tate as she pleaded with her killers to spare her unborn son. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury also found that Watson, Krenwinkel and Van Houten, a former 
homecoming princess from Monrovia, stabbed the LaBiancas. But this time, the 
evidence showed, Manson entered the house first, tied up the couple and left 
before the killing started. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Kasabian, a Manson family newcomer who was along both nights because she 
was the only one with a valid driver's license, turned state's evidence and 
testified against the others. 
</P>
<P>
 At the trial, Bugliosi argued that the motive for the murders was a bizarre 
plan to trigger a race war known as Helter Skelter, a name taken from a Beatles 
song. 
</P>
<P>
 Manson said that blacks were inferior to whites but would win the war. Then, 
unable to rule, they would hand over power to Manson and his all-white family, 
which planned to survive by living underground near Death Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The 9 1/2-month trial of Manson, Atkins, Krenwinkel and Van Houten -- a record 
length for its time -- was punctuated by memorable moments: Manson and his 
"girls" cutting Xs in their foreheads; Manson lunging at Judge Charles H. Older 
with a pencil; President Richard Nixon proclaiming Manson guilty in mid-trial 
headlines; Manson and his followers shaving their heads, and the disappearance 
of Van Houten's attorney, Ronald Hughes. He was later found dead and 
prosecutors believe he was another Manson victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Manson, Atkins and Krenwinkel were found guilty on seven counts of murder. Van 
Houten was convicted of two murders. Watson was tried separately and convicted 
of seven murders. In a later trial, Manson was convicted in the murder of two 
other family victims, music teacher Gary Hinman and ranch hand Donald (Shorty) 
Shea. 
</P>
<P>
 Manson and his four followers were sentenced to death, but in 1972 the state 
Supreme Court overturned capital punishment and their sentences were reduced to 
life in prison. Although up for parole many times, all five remain behind bars. 
Kasabian moved to the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 After the trial, Garretson sued the Los Angeles Police Department for false 
arrest, seeking $1 million. In 1974, a jury decided that the police had acted 
properly, in part because he was the only survivor found on the estate. 
</P>
<P>
 But the jurors also were sympathetic. "We felt Garretson was the sixth victim" 
of the Benedict Canyon murders, foreman John Rutherford said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Garretson returned to Ohio soon after his release from jail. Today, he drives 
a truck for a grocery store chain and his brief time in Los Angeles is a 
distant blur. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try not to even think about it," he said. "It was a terrifying experience 
in my life and it was a tragedy. It's something I would like to leave in the 
past." Manson Speaks About Life Behind Bars 
</P>
<P>
 California's most notorious criminal spends his time at the state prison in 
Corcoran, doing menial chores, playing his guitar and planting a flower garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Manson will turn 60 in November. He still claims he is innocent of the 
Tate-LaBianca murders and contends he was denied a fair trial. But after 
spending three-quarters of his life locked up, he says he has no desire to 
leave prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "What would I want out for?" he asked in a telephone interview. "This beats an 
old folks home." 
</P>
<P>
 He long ago turned the X on his forehead into a swastika, but he says he was 
never the villain the media have made him out to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am a man of God," he said. "I am not a bad person, I am a good person." 
</P>
<P>
 The son of a 16-year-old prostitute who was imprisoned for armed robbery, 
Manson was born in Cincinnati and spent his childhood being shuttled among 
relatives, boys' homes and juvenile halls. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing to a height of 5-foot-2, he became a con man, a pimp, a forger and a 
thief. He was convicted of armed robbery when he was 13, homosexual rape when 
he was 17 and beating his first wife when he was 20. By the time he was 32, he 
had spent 17 years locked up. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day in March, 1967, when he was paroled from Terminal Island, he 
pleaded with prison authorities to let him stay in the only home he knew, 
according to "Helter Skelter," the best-selling book written by prosecutor 
Bugliosi and co-author Curt Gentry. Manson was released anyway and arrived in 
the Haight-Ashbury area of San Francisco, where the hippies were in full bloom. 
</P>
<P>
 He had learned the guitar in prison and began playing his songs to attract 
women. Then, like the pimp he once was, he used his women to recruit men. His 
family quickly multiplied, living for a while with Beach Boys drummer Dennis 
Wilson in his Sunset Boulevard mansion, and later splitting time between the 
Death Valley area and the Spahn ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 Manson and his followers took LSD and other psychedelic drugs, lived off 
discarded food and petty crime and indulged in orgies that were orchestrated by 
Manson to break down sexual taboos. His followers believed he was Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 Held in various state prisons since 1971, his life behind bars has been 
eventful. He was set on fire by inmates at the California Medical Facility at 
Vacaville, and was attacked by prisoners at San Quentin and Folsom prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 He has broken prison rules 60 times: spitting in a guard's face, throwing hot 
coffee at a staff member, possessing a hacksaw blade, refusing to obey orders, 
fighting and trying to flood a tier. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, he spent more than five years in near solitary confinement at 
Corcoran, body-searched and manacled each time he moved from the cell. In May, 
the restrictions were eased and he was moved into the high-security Protective 
Housing Unit. 
</P>
<P>
 He now has a cellmate and access to a telephone and dines with such infamous 
killers as mass murderer Juan Corona and Sirhan Sirhan, Robert F. Kennedy's 
assassin. Of Sirhan, Manson said: "He's cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Charlie Manson -- still longhaired but with gray in his beard -- has 
become something of a cult hero among some young people too young to remember 
the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Guns N' Roses album, Manson's recordings are available in 
stores. So is a song by Manson that the Beach Boys recorded in 1968 without 
giving him credit. 
</P>
<P>
 His face is seen on clothing and trading cards. And there is an underground 
market in Manson memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard and Dan Lemmons, who make a controversial line of Manson T-shirts 
under the name Zooport Riot Gear in Newport Beach, say they have sold 25,000 
shirts and caps bearing his likeness. 
</P>
<P>
 "His face represents the counterculture rebellion against society," said 
Richard Lemmons, 36. 
</P>
<P>
 The brothers promised Manson they would pay him 10 cents for each item sold. 
But after learning of Bartek Frykowski's claim on the prisoner's earnings, they 
said they put his share in escrow and do not feel he is owed anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Prison officials say they have no way of knowing if Manson has received income 
from royalties or interview fees -- or even whether he maintains bank accounts. 
Manson insists he has not made a penny from the merchandising of his name. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do I need money in prison for?" he said. "They give me clothes, they 
feed me. I don't need to pay rent. I don't need money for lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Manson's supporters have begun making the case that the cult leader 
should be freed from prison. 
</P>
<P>
 They say he was wrongly convicted of murder because he was not present when 
the killings occurred. Some, like Manson, say he was not allowed to present a 
defense in court. Others go so far as to say, erroneously, that he was 
convicted only of conspiracy. 
</P>
<P>
 A few suggest -- without the benefit of any proof -- that there was a 
conspiracy to cover up the murders by powerful people in the entertainment 
industry. "It was a different time back then," Richard Lemmons said. "You could 
get convicted on a lot less evidence than today." 
</P>
<P>
 Contending that the Helter Skelter motive is too absurd to be believed, 
supporters offer different motives that focus the blame primarily on Watson. 
Some say the killings were the result of a drug deal gone bad. Others contend 
that they were copycat murders intended to free Bobby Beausoleil, a family 
member in jail for the stabbing a few days earlier of music teacher Hinman. 
Hinman's killers had written "POLITICAL PIGGY" on the wall in his blood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tex Watson is the one who killed everybody and is responsible for the whole 
thing," said John Aes-Nihil of Canoga Park, who sells a range of Manson 
memorabilia, including Jay Sebring shampoo boxes. "There is some possibility 
(Manson) is guilty of conspiracy to commit murder, but I don't think he did 
anything illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 The effort to rewrite history and glorify Manson disturbs Bugliosi, who made 
his reputation by putting Manson behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
 "They think he's a cool guy," Bugliosi said. "They don't know who he is. For 
someone to be sentenced to death, and then all these years later to have Manson 
T-shirts and songs on pop albums is really a sad commentary." 
</P>
<P>
 Bugliosi vigorously disputes Manson's contention that he did not receive a 
fair trial and was not allowed to present a defense. 
</P>
<P>
 During the prosecution's case, Manson's attorney conducted extensive 
cross-examination of the witnesses, Bugliosi noted. After the prosecution 
ended, Manson and his co-defendants rested their case without calling any 
witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Atkins, Krenwinkel and Van Houten said they wanted to testify and 
take the blame for the killings. But their attorneys objected and the judge 
refused to overrule the lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The claim that Manson was not allowed to present a defense is so silly and 
ludicrous," Bugliosi said. 
</P>
<P>
 And the fact that Manson did not inflict a fatal wound on any of the victims, 
Bugliosi said, does not make him any less a murderer under the law. "If you 
order a murder, you can't insulate yourself from criminal responsibility," he 
said. "Manson was the architect, the mastermind of the murders." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Paul Fitzgerald, who represented Krenwinkel, is among those 
who agree that there is no question Manson was properly convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who are saying he is not guilty are muddled thinkers who have not 
examined the record and are saying it for the wrong reasons," he said. "This 
adulation of him as a mass killer, a convicted killer of innocent people, is 
kind of ghastly -- a leader with a swastika carved in his head is beyond sicko. 
It makes my skin crawl. He's not an antihero, he's a creep." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Krenwinkel, Van Houten and Atkins broke their silence and condemned 
Manson, urging young people not to think of him as a hero. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can assure you . . . from firsthand experience that his depravity and depth 
of cruelty make him a truly base human being, deserving no one's attention, let 
alone admiration," Atkins wrote in a letter to The Times and other newspapers 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Manson still delivers the same message of social calamity in his rambling, 
disjointed style. The environment is being destroyed, he says; its children are 
being abused and ignored. The planet is in chaos and helter skelter -- a state 
of confusion -- is at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would take a madman to adjust to this world," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The entertainment industry has turned good and evil upside down, helping to 
make heroes of violent criminals, he said. "What is a bad guy these days? It 
seems to be the good guy," he said. "Arnold Schwarzenegger -- it's OK for him 
to escape from prison and kill eight or nine people. Where are your standards?" 
</P>
<P>
 While denying that he ordered the Tate-LaBianca murders or was involved in the 
killing, Manson suggested that the slayings were part of an effort to bring 
about social change. He also says there is no reason he should feel remorse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody in the world wants to get mad at me because I won't show remorse 
because somebody died," he said. "Somebody dies every day." 
</P>
<P>
 For Bugliosi, the trial was the case of a career. He ran for Los Angeles 
County district attorney and lost, then spent two years working on "Helter 
Skelter." He has taken occasional legal cases and written other true-crime 
books. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one negative association about the case," he said, "is no matter what I 
do, I'll be forever known as the Manson prosecutor." 
</P>
<P>
 But he understands the fascination with Manson. More than any other crime, he 
says, the gruesome murders and Manson's power over his followers have both 
repelled and captivated the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "The very name Manson has become a metaphor for evil," Bugliosi said. "Over 
the past 25 years, he has come to represent the dark and malignant side of 
humanity, and for whatever reason, there is a side of human nature that is 
fascinated with ultimate evil." Victims' Survivors Continue the Vigil 
</P>
<P>
 On the day after the Tate killings, Susan Struthers was among those who found 
the bodies of her mother, Rosemary LaBianca, and stepfather, Leno. In the weeks 
following, she suffered a nervous breakdown. Later, she began to find peace as 
a born-again Christian. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mid-1980s, she started writing anonymous letters to Tex Watson, the 
most brutal of the Manson family killers. In prison, he had also become a 
born-again Christian, gotten married and fathered three children during 
conjugal visits. 
</P>
<P>
 After corresponding with Watson for a year, Struthers decided she wanted to 
meet him. "My motive was to bring understanding to the tragedy of losing my 
parents," she later explained. 
</P>
<P>
 She visited him at the California Men's Colony in San Luis Obispo and soon was 
convinced of his remorse and sincerity. And so she told Watson she was the 
daughter of the LaBiancas, forgave him and began spending time with his family 
and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Known by her married name of Susan LaBerge, she appeared in 1990 at Watson's 
parole hearing and argued that he was a model prisoner who had paid his debt to 
society. 
</P>
<P>
 "During our visit, I shared the forgiveness I felt toward him and I felt very 
certain that Charles was deeply remorseful for what he had done," she told the 
parole board. 
</P>
<P>
 By a strange coincidence, LaBerge was living in the same coastal California 
town as Patti Tate, Sharon's younger sister, when they happened to meet in the 
late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The women discovered their common past, but quickly realized that their 
differing beliefs would keep them from ever becoming friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Needless to say, it created a hostile situation between us," Tate said. "To 
even think Watson deserves to get out of prison, I don't know where she's 
coming from." 
</P>
<P>
 Following in the footsteps of her mother, Doris Tate, Patti has become an 
outspoken opponent of parole for Manson family members and an advocate of 
tougher laws against crime. Now 36, she too has appeared at parole hearings, 
but her goal has been to confront, not forgive, her sister's killers. 
</P>
<P>
 At a hearing last year for Susan Atkins, Patti Tate recalled, "I stood up and 
said: 'My sister would have loved to have her baby. I would love to have my 
nephew here. But you took that away.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After the murders, Doris Tate became a strong anti-crime advocate and helped 
collect more than 350,000 signatures on petitions opposing parole for the 
Manson followers. Shortly before her death in 1992, she founded the Doris Tate 
Crime Victims Bureau, a Sacramento group that lobbies for tougher sanctions 
against criminals. Patti Tate serves on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel it's very unfortunate that we even have to worry about these people 
ever getting out," she said. "When someone has a life sentence, it should be 
that exactly." 
</P>
<P>
 At least eight of the original family members are serving life terms. Others 
have done time for assorted crimes and are scattered across California, Nevada 
and the Midwest. 
</P>
<P>
 In the San Joaquin Valley farm towns around the Corcoran prison, rumors abound 
of Manson followers who remain in the area. But the only original family member 
with a visible presence is Sandra Good, who took an apartment in Hanford to be 
near Manson. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Manson's most loyal supporters, she was in jail on other charges during 
the 1969 murder rampage, but joined the family's Downtown street corner vigils 
during the trial. When Manson carved an X on his forehead, she did the same. 
When Manson shaved his head, she shaved hers. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1971, Good was convicted of helping family member Kenneth Como escape from 
prison. She served six months. In 1975, she mailed threatening letters to 
corporate executives and government officials. She was sentenced to 15 years in 
prison and served 10. 
</P>
<P>
 When her parole in Vermont ended in 1991, she moved back to California. Prison 
officials have refused to let her see Manson and she has petitioned the court 
for visiting privileges. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Good said she was never among those who believed Manson was 
Christ. "To me, he is far beyond Jesus Christ, far bigger," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She explained her devotion to Manson, saying: "He has real authority. I'm 
talking about the kind of authority that comes from God. Manson has always 
spoken the truth and that is a big part of the reason he is locked up." 
</P>
<P>
 She rejects the idea that the Tate-LaBianca murders were committed to bring on 
the disintegration of society. But, she said: "You see where L.A. is at. You 
see the real helter skelter unfolding before your eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 And unlike the three women who took part in the Tate-LaBianca killings, Good 
still says the murders were justified as a necessary prelude to social change. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were the kids that cared and wanted to change the world and, yes, those 
murders were very justified," Good said. "In spirit, I'm still at war. That's 
just as powerful as if I went and put a knife in some person's stomach in 
Hollywood." THE MANSON MURDERS: 25 YEARS LATER 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 9, 1969, neighbors called Los Angeles police to a murder scene in the 
Hollywood Hills that would absorb the nation's attention and add a new name to 
those of the notorious: Charles Manson. Just 5 foot 2, a career criminal, 
Manson possessed a stare and a sinister charm. He was a small-time songwriter 
and pal of Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys, who recorded a Manson song. In the 
summer of 1969, Manson was the guru to a band of more than two dozen young 
people who hung out in the rocky hills above Chatsworth, taking drugs and 
making forays into the city. Twenty-five years later, Manson has become a kind 
of criminal antihero, his songs sold in record stores, his image sold on 
T-shirts and trading cards and his writings discussed on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
 * CHARLES MANSON, 59: He was not present during any of the August, 1969, 
murders. A problem prisoner at California State Prison at Corcoran, he has been 
rejected for parole eight times. 
</P>
<P>
 *** 
</P>
<P>
 TERRIFYING TIMES 
</P>
<P>
 * July 31, 1969: Musician Gary Hinman is found stabbed to death in his Old 
Topanga Road home. The phrase "POLITICAL PIGGY" is scrawled in blood on his 
wall. Manson follower Bobby Beausoleil is arrested driving Hinman's Volkswagen 
bus. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aug. 9: The quiet of Benedict Canyon is broken over several hours by screams 
and gunshots. Police find a chilling scene: on the lawn lies a man's body, 
stabbed, bludgeoned and shot. Nearby is the body of a woman. "PIG" is written 
in blood on the front door. Inside are the bodies of Sharon Tate, the pregnant 
actress who rents the house with husband, Roman Polanski, and hairstylist Jay 
Sebring. A fifth body is found outside. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aug. 10: At a Los Feliz house, another nauseating murder scene. Leno and 
Rosemary LaBianca have been stabbed. "DEATH TO PIGS" is scrawled in blood; on 
the refrigerator is the misspelled title of a Beatles song: "HEALTER SKELTER." 
The writings eventually help police link the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aug. 25: Donald (Shorty) Shea, a horse wrangler at the Spahn Movie Ranch 
near Chatsworth, is killed, apparently because he came to the murders. 
</P>
<P>
 * October: Raids on the remote Barker Ranch near Death Valley link some of the 
killings to a band of young, hippie-looking petty criminals. Manson, a 
fledgling song writer who knew Beach Boys drummer Dennis Wilson, had been to 
the Benedict Canyon house when the group's producer lived there. 
</P>
<P>
 * June 15, 1970 -- Jan. 25, 1971: Manson, Susan Atkins, Leslie Van Houten and 
Patricia Krenwinkel are tried for murder. All are found guilty and sentenced to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 * October 1971: Tex Watson, tried separately, is found guilty and sentenced to 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 * Feb. 18, 1972: The death sentences were commuted to life imprisonment when 
the state Supreme Court abolished the death penalty. Now the convicts eligible 
for parole hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 *** 
</P>
<P>
 THE VICTIMS 
</P>
<P>
 In Benedict Canyon: 
</P>

Dolls," she was married to film director Roman Polanski. She pleaded with the 
killers to spare the life of her unborn child, due in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 * JAY SEBRING, 35: A Hollywood hairdresser and former boyfriend of Tate. Among 
his clients was David Geffen, head of Geffen Records, which recently released a 
Guns N' Roses album with a song written by Manson. 
</P>
<P>
 * VOYTEK FRYKOWSKI, 32: A friend of Polanski, he came from a wealthy Polish 
family and was staying with Polanski and Tate.

was just leaving as the murderers arrived and became their first victim. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere: 
</P>
<P>
 * LENO LABIANCA, 44, and ROSEMARY LABIANCA, 38: Owners of a chain of Los 
Angeles grocery stores. Their house was chosen by Manson, who tied them up, 
then left the killing to others.

and received immunity for testifying. Now a mother of four, she is believed to 
be living on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 * VINCENT BUGLIOSI: The lead Manson prosecutor, he lost an election to be Los 
Angeles County district attorney and co-wrote "Helter Skelter," the 
best-selling book on the Manson case. Has written other books and occasionally 
takes legal clients. 
</P>
<P>
 * STEPHEN KAY: He helped prosecute some family members and remains with the 
Los Angeles County district attorney's office. Has attended 47 parole hearings 
to argue against the release of Manson family members.

NATO BLASTS REBEL SERB TARGETS NEAR SARAJEVO; BOSNIA: AIR STRIKE COMES IN 
RETALIATION FOR DEFIANT WEAPONS RAID. ALLIED ATTACK DESTROYS A 'TANK-BUSTER' 
GUN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 NATO warplanes attacked Bosnian Serb military positions near Sarajevo on 
Friday after the rebels crowned a desperate round of provocations by seizing 
weapons from U.N. peacekeepers and forcing down a French helicopter with 
machine-gun fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen North Atlantic Treaty Organization planes, including four U.S. A-10s, 
scrambled from alliance air bases across Italy for a sundown sweep over the 
Serbian-encircled Bosnian capital, blasting at preset targets and destroying at 
least one 76-millimeter "tank-buster" gun. 
</P>
<P>
 The first use of Western air power near Sarajevo spurred an immediate bleat of 
contrition from one rebel leader, who apologized for the pre-dawn raid on the 
weapons depot and promised to give back the captured hardware, said Michael 
Williams from U.N. Protection Force headquarters in Zagreb, Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 But Williams, the senior spokesman for the beleaguered peacekeeping mission, 
voiced skepticism that the rebel military leaders have been so quickly cowed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There remains a question in our minds that the reassurances this evening are 
from the Bosnian Serb political leaders, and one would hope those reassurances 
would also apply to the military leaders," Williams said, adding that the 
mission has learned "all too often (the Bosnian Serbs) fall back into a pattern 
of provocations and difficulties." 
</P>
<P>
 Assurances that the stolen T-55 tank, two armored personnel carriers and an 
antiaircraft gun would be returned were offered by Momcilo Krajisnik, the 
self-styled parliamentary leader who often strikes a moderate pose while the 
Bosnian Serb military presses on with offensives. 
</P>
<P>
 There were reports that some of the equipment had been returned. But British 
Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, the U.N. commander in Bosnia-Herzegovina, gave the Serbs 
until today to surrender all the weapons taken from Ukrainian troops guarding a 
containment site in Serbian-held Ilidza. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose warned that he is ready to renew his call for air strikes if the Bosnian 
Serbs persist in violating a weapons exclusion zone proclaimed around Sarajevo 
in February and backed by NATO threats to bomb heavy weapons menacing the city. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. mission commanders moved swiftly to avoid the kind of retaliation 
inflicted by Bosnian Serbs after two token NATO air strikes in April against 
rebel artillery attacking the U.N. "safe area" of Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 All air activities in and around Sarajevo were suspended, including a food 
airlift on hold since July 20. U.N. troops in Bosnian Serbian-held areas were 
earlier redeployed out of the rebels' reach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We learned some lessons from the April experience," Williams conceded, 
alluding to instances of hostage-taking and harassment of U.N. forces after the 
earlier air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 At NATO's Southern European Command in Naples, Italy, U.S. Adm. Leighton Smith 
said a desire to avoid civilian casualties was the determining factor in 
selecting the air strike targets. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. and NATO military leaders ordered the pilots to strike only if they could 
be certain of "zero collateral damage," Smith said, using the military 
euphemism for civilian fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward air controllers reported at least one sighting of ground-to-air 
retaliatory fire during the NATO attack, a senior Pentagon official in 
Washington said. But no damage or injuries were sustained, and all aircraft 
returned safely to their Italian bases, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 The antitank weapon destroyed in the air strike was nine miles southwest of 
central Sarajevo, "well within the 20-kilometer exclusion zone," Smith told 
reporters, referring to the 12.5-mile radius delineated around the Bosnian 
capital in February. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack force consisted of four French Mirage F-1 CTs, four British Jaguar 
fighters, four Dutch F-16s and the U.S. A-10s; there was also a handful of 
support aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two A-10 "Warthogs" actually fired at the Bosnian Serb positions, said 
Capt. Rich Eich, a spokesman at the Naples headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 No bombs were dropped, but the two aircraft fired about 600 rounds between 
them from their 30-millimeter guns, Eich said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least the one M-18 antitank gun was destroyed, and NATO and U.N. forces 
were still assessing the results of the action, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House and State Department welcomed the NATO action, which was 
called for by Rose, who has previously shown reluctance to use force against 
the Bosnian Serb belligerents for fear of exposing his peacekeeping troops to 
retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher called the NATO attack a way of keeping 
additional pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to accept an international peace plan 
for Bosnia. "I think it was a good step forward today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose insisted that the attack in no way compromised the neutrality of his 
forces, saying the air strikes were "a proportionate response." 
</P>
<P>
 But by repeatedly stressing at a briefing in Sarajevo after the bombing that 
his mission is "not going to war with the Serbs," Rose may have encouraged the 
rebel leadership to continue probing the limits of Western resolve to force an 
end to the worst bloodshed in Europe since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 At NATO headquarters in Brussels, the sense of relief was almost tangible that 
the U.N. mission had actually called for alliance air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tension between the two organizations has been more or less constant since 
NATO issued its first ultimatum Feb. 9 that led to an end of 22 months of 
artillery bombardment of Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance, eager to preserve its credibility as a potent military force, 
has often been frustrated by the United Nations' reluctance to act. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the more than two years of fighting in Bosnia, the Bosnian Serbs have 
never been more isolated diplomatically. Abandoned -- at least for the moment 
-- by their only allies of any significance in Moscow and Belgrade, diplomatic 
pressure against air strikes was virtually zero. 
</P>
<P>
 Forces loyal to Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic provoked the NATO attack 
with a series of aggressive moves against Sarajevo and U.N. forces over the 
past weeks punctuating their refusal to accept a U.S.- and European-mediated 
peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The last straw appeared to be the barrage of small-arms fire that forced down 
a French Puma helicopter that was trying to track the four heavy-artillery 
pieces stolen from the U.N. containment site around 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose appealed to the U.N. Protection Force commander, French Gen. Bertrand de 
Lapresle, for air power to punish the blatant violation of NATO's edict against 
heavy artillery being deployed within the exclusion zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Bosnian Serb tanks, guns and howitzers had been withdrawn to avoid air 
strikes ahead of the February NATO deadline. But recent reluctance to punish 
violations with force had encouraged the rebels to gradually reposition dozens 
of guns and mortars around Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. peacekeeping officials had been treading lightly in the face of Bosnian 
Serb violations, probably in the expectation that they would accept a 
negotiated settlement of the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Karadzic and the ultranationalists who dominate his rogue government 
rejected the take-it-or-leave-it peace plan and moved to close in on Sarajevo 
by cutting off its sole supply route, grounding a humanitarian airlift and 
dramatically stepping up sniper and mortar fire against civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb fighters had put the peacekeeping mission on notice earlier this 
week that they intended to retrieve weapons surrendered to the United Nations 
in February, claiming that they were needed for battles raging elsewhere in 
Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 That prompted Rose to warn he would use any means available to him to prevent 
the weapons' recapture, including air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the U.N. hierarchy's earlier reluctance to use force against the rebels, 
coupled with a timid response by the mediating countries at a meeting in Geneva 
last weekend, probably led the Bosnian Serbs to believe the latest threats were 
also empty. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats from the United States, Russia, Britain, France and Germany have 
drafted a settlement proposal that aims to bring peace to Bosnia by dividing 
it, granting the Bosnian Serb rebels rule over 49% and a Muslim-Croatian 
federation the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muslim-backed Sarajevo government reluctantly approved the plan, but the 
Serbs have repeatedly rejected it, demanding control over all conquered 
territory and the right to annex it to the neighboring state of Serbia. The 
Retaliation 
</P>
<P>
 To protect Sarajevo, NATO imposed a weapons exclusion zone around the city on 
Feb. 21. NATO had been reluctant to use air strikes. But the seizure of weapons 
by Bosnian Serbs threatened an increasingly shaky truce. 
</P>
<P>
 THE PROVOCATION 
</P>
<P>
 1) An undetermined number of Bosnian Serbs raid U.N. weapons depot, seizing a 
tank, armored personnel carriers and other weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 2) U.N. commanders send a French Puma helicopter to track the tank, but the 
helicopter is forced down by several rounds of small-arms fire. 
</P>
<P>
 THE RESPONSE 
</P>
<P>
 3) U.S. A-10 jets blast apart a "tank-buster" gun in one of four NATO 
responses. The Pentagon would not reveal the three other targets. NATO 
Involvement 
</P>
<P>
 The North Atlantic Treaty Organization's air strikes against Bosnian Serb 
targets in Bosnia-Herzegovina on Friday marked the fourth time that the Western 
alliance has used force in the civil war. Every attack has been on Bosnian Serb 
targets. Following is a chronology of NATO's growing involvement in Bosnia: 
</P>
<P>
 * July, 1992: NATO agrees to use naval force in Adriatic to review compliance 
with U.N. sanctions imposed on Serbia and Montenegro, which make up the rump 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 * October, 1992: NATO agrees to use surveillance aircraft to monitor U.N. ban 
on military flights over Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 * April, 1993: NATO begins combat patrols with fighters over Bosnia to enforce 
compliance with U.N. ban on flights. 
</P>
<P>
 * June, 1993: NATO offers close air support to U.N. troops and other personnel 
in Bosnia if they are attacked and request air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 * August, 1993: NATO threatens air strikes against Bosnian Serb forces 
attacking Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 * January, 1994: NATO summit meeting in Brussels confirms all previous 
decisions and says it is ready to use air strikes to help reopen Tuzla's 
airport for aid flights if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 * February, 1994: NATO gives Bosnian Serbs 10 days to withdraw heavy weapons 
from around Sarajevo or hand them over to U.N. control; otherwise, they will 
face air strikes. The Serbs LAT

BOXER'S BID TO PUT NATIONAL GUARD AT BORDER IS STYMIED; IMMIGRATION: PENTAGON 
REFUSES TO IMPLEMENT SENATOR'S PLAN, WHICH IT SAYS LACKS LEGAL AUTHORITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN F. BUNTING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ten months after Sen. Barbara Boxer secured federal funds to deploy National 
Guard troops to hinder illegal immigration, the program has not been 
implemented anywhere in the country and the Department of Defense has no plans 
to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the first-term California senator hailed her so-called "Boxer 
National Guard Plan" as an innovative solution to the state's illegal 
immigration problem. Supplementing federal Border Patrol agents with 
"well-trained, well-equipped" military personnel, Boxer said at the time, 
"could prove the most cost-effective way to bolster enforcement at the 
California border." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after Congress passed the legislation, however, the Defense Department 
ruled that the plan lacked any legal authority and decided not to carry it out. 
Thus, no state has been allowed to apply for the program and no federal money 
has been allocated for assigning National Guard units to deter illegal 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when California's politicians are rushing to offer solutions to the 
problems many voters believe are caused by illegal immigration, this is an 
account of one major initiative that generated tremendous publicity, yet has 
accomplished little or nothing. The failure of the Boxer plan reveals the 
difficulties of finding answers to the vexing problem of unlawful immigration 
as well as the risks of proposing quick fixes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, (Boxer's office) didn't do their homework in terms of the legal 
requirements," said one Pentagon official, who spoke on the condition of 
anonymity. "What was accomplished was not what they represented." 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer declined to be interviewed about her border plan for this story. In a 
statement released by her office Friday, she said her objectives had been 
achieved, but she did not acknowledge that the Defense Department has refused 
to carry out her plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "To our knowledge no state has applied but the option is still available," the 
statement said. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many politicians in California, Boxer succeeded in attracting favorable 
attention for her efforts to crack down on the tide of immigrants who enter the 
country illegally. The senator's staff pointed to a Times poll last fall that 
found that 73% of Californians supported using the National Guard to halt 
illegal border crossings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Boxer plan appealed to the public, it has continued to draw 
widespread criticism from immigration reformists and immigrant rights activists 
-- two sides that rarely see eye to eye. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boxer legislation is "an irresponsible suggestion at a time when the 
California Democratic Party needs strong, sensible leadership on a divisive 
issue," said Frank Sharry, executive director of National Immigration Forum, a 
Washington-based immigrant rights organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Stein, executive director of the conservative Federation for American 
Immigration Reform, said the press release that initially floated the Boxer 
plan produced no more than a paper airplane. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not aware of any other senator last year who tried to so brazenly exploit 
the issue without having done any kind of homework or without even a pretense 
of follow-up," Stein said. "The initiative had so many obvious legal pitfalls 
and potential constitutional problems that needed to be worked out that it was 
never entertained as a legitimate proposal." 
</P>
<P>
 The Boxer plan was neither scrutinized by the Senate nor voted on separately 
by Congress. Instead, at Boxer's request, language was inserted into the 
Senate's $239-billion defense appropriations bill directing the Pentagon to 
make available "not less than $2 million" for Border Patrol-related activities 
by the Guard. The money, subject to Pentagon approval of applications submitted 
by individual states, would come from the same federal account used by the 
Guard to assist law enforcement agencies in anti-drug operations. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Defense Department policy states that anti-drug funds cannot be used 
for immigration or any other non-drug purpose, Pentagon officials said. Because 
Boxer's language did not grant specific legal authority to spend defense 
dollars on border enforcement, the Pentagon refused to allow states even to 
request money to fight illegal immigration under the Boxer plan, said Maj. 
Toivo Nei, a spokesman for the National Guard Bureau in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The Boxer plan "did not give us any legal authority to do anything 
differently, nor did it give us any additional funding," Nei said. 
</P>
<P>
 So while California officials expressed interest in applying for the funds, 
they were prevented from doing so by the Defense Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a document from the National Guard Bureau saying (the Boxer plan) is 
not legal and we can't do it," said Lt. Col. Tim Callan, executive officer of 
the California National Guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the use of military troops to upgrade border enforcement is not 
supported by the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 "The notion of putting the National Guard on the border, I hope you'll agree 
with me, is simply not in this agency's or this country's best interests," INS 
Commissioner Doris Meissner wrote to employees last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Guard initiative stood out as Boxer's major immigration proposal during 
her first year in the Senate. She also supported the hiring of 400 new Border 
Patrol agents and spending $350 million to reimburse states for the cost of 
incarcerating undocumented felons. A Boxer proposal to double the criminal 
penalties for forging identification papers passed as part of the Senate crime 
bill and awaits final action. 
</P>
<P>
 When Boxer unveiled her National Guard proposal in July of last year, she 
suggested assigning 4,000 personnel to spend their obligated 15 days of annual 
training at the border. Under the plan, the troops would provide administrative 
assistance and accompany federal agents on patrol, but would not be authorized 
to make arrests or searches. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of armed forces in military uniforms assisting in immigration 
patrols at the nation's borders for the first time in history drew protests 
from civil rights groups and criticism even from Republican hard-liners on the 
issue such as Gov. Pete Wilson. He called the plan "not helpful" and a 
violation of an international treaty that bans armed troops on the border. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Wilson Administration embraced parts of the Boxer proposal that would 
provide federal funding for non-enforcement jobs such as manning observation 
posts, repairing roads, erecting fences, transporting prisoners and maintaining 
vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 These types of support services already were being provided at the border by 
the California National Guard at a cost of $19 million in federal anti-drug 
funds. In April, Wilson announced plans to triple the number of National Guard 
troops assisting the Border Patrol at the state's southern boundary to work 
exclusively in the anti-drug, backup role. Under Wilson's order, 127 additional 
National Guardsmen were assigned to the California-Mexico border using a 
combination of federal drug interdiction funds and state money. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer was quick to issue a statement applauding Wilson's order, even though 
her legislation did not provide any of the financing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very pleased the governor has agreed that there is a good way to use the 
resources of the National Guard, in a civilian capacity, so Border Patrol 
officials can be freed up to do the important work of securing the border," 
Boxer said in April. 
</P>
<P>
 In her statement Friday, Boxer said she saw no need to revise her legislation 
because the National Guard was being deployed at the California-Mexico border. 
She acknowledged that the Guard was already being used in the anti-drug role 
before she offered her plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Political analysts remain baffled why Boxer, one of the most liberal members 
of Congress who counts civil rights and minority leaders among her most loyal 
constituents, staked out territory that is normally the domain of much more 
conservative politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 Some suggested that Boxer felt pressure to come up with a solution to keep 
pace with her California colleague, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who has proposed a 
wide range of reforms that include a border crossing fee to pay for more patrol 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, the National Guard initiative brought Boxer considerable 
discomfort. She became so upset with criticism from civil rights groups and 
Latino activists that she stormed out of a meeting with them in her San 
Francisco office last summer, according to participants. Also, two Latino aides 
on Boxer's Washington staff told colleagues that they resigned partly in 
frustration over the senator's National Guard proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Boxer unveiled her plan, proposals to put the Guard at the border were 
considered far removed from the political mainstream, said Robert Rubin, 
assistant director of the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Rubin said, Boxer has "allowed herself to be used by the extremist forces 
to push the debate in the exclusionary direction that it was going."

ATTORNEY TELLS OF RTC EFFORT TO INCRIMINATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RISEN and MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A senior savings and loan regulator Friday accused lower-level officials at 
the Resolution Trust Corp. of setting her up to make compromising statements 
about Whitewater-related events, implying that they tried to get her drunk and 
then secretly tape-recorded her comments. 
</P>
<P>
 Testifying before a House panel on the last day of hearings into the Clinton 
Administration's handling of the Whitewater case, RTC attorney April Breslaw 
said she believes that agency investigators may have conspired with their 
supervisor to arrange the bugged conversations during a controversial one-day 
visit by Breslaw to the agency's regional office in Kansas City in February. 
</P>
<P>
 One tape-recording made during Breslaw's visit was later turned over to Rep. 
Jim Leach (R-Iowa), ranking Republican on the House Banking, Finance and Urban 
Affairs Committee, which has been investigating Whitewater. A transcript of the 
tape has been made available to the rest of the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans contended that the taped conversation suggests Breslaw tried to 
pressure RTC investigators in Kansas City, who were looking into the failure of 
Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan, to conclude that an ill-fated land venture 
involving President Clinton and First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton did not 
contribute to taxpayer-subsidized losses of the S&L. 
</P>
<P>
 Breslaw denied that she had exerted such pressure, however, saying that she 
has "no recollection" of suggesting to the Kansas City staff that the RTC's 
upper management in Washington "hoped for a particular outcome" of the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 With Breslaw's testimony, two weeks of inconclusive Whitewater hearings drew 
to an exhausted close amid partisan recriminations in both the House committee 
and the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, which has also 
been conducting Whitewater hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 As the hearings ended Friday, Republican lawmakers, led by Sen. Alfonse M. 
D'Amato (R-N.Y.), called again for the resignation of Deputy Treasury Secretary 
Roger Altman. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans charge that the evidence shows Altman lied to Congress when he 
testified about Whitewater before the Senate committee earlier this year and 
they charge that he has still not told the truth about his involvement in the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even at this late date, Mr. Altman continues to temporize, excuse, dodge and 
shift blame in a desperate effort to cling to his public office," charged 
D'Amato, the Senate panel's ranking Republican. "He should behave honorably and 
leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Democrats on the panel declined to join the attack publicly, yet they 
remain "highly troubled" by Altman's testimony, noted Committee Chairman Sen. 
Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.). 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, committee members charged that Altman deliberately misled them 
when he said at hearings Feb. 24 that he knew of only one "substantive" 
Whitewater-related contact between White House and Treasury officials. But over 
the last week, the House and Senate panels have heard testimony about as many 
as 40 such contacts, including four involving Altman personally, by the time of 
his Feb. 24 appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate committee also heard testimony over the last week by several senior 
White House officials who said they realized as Altman was testifying at the 
earlier hearing that he was not giving complete answers. They were especially 
alarmed that Altman did not tell the senators that he had decided to disqualify 
himself from the Madison Guaranty case but delayed the decision after 
then-White House Counsel Bernard Nussbaum urged him at the Feb. 2 meeting to 
reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Amato said that these and other omissions in Altman's earlier testimony had 
destroyed the Treasury deputy's credibility with Congress to the point where it 
could never be repaired. 
</P>
<P>
 "From this day forward, we will be unable and unwilling to accept or rely upon 
any statement, action or judgment of Roger Altman," he said as the hearings 
came to a close. 
</P>
<P>
 Riegle, meanwhile, admonished White House Counsel Lloyd N. Cutler, the panel's 
last witness Friday, that "we cannot have situations arise in the future where 
witnesses come before committees of Congress and are anything less than fully 
candid. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pass that message . . . to every nook and cranny of the executive branch." 
</P>
<P>
 Cutler, in his testimony, continued to insist that no one in the 
Administration ever sought to interfere with or impede the RTC's investigation 
into Madison Guaranty. 
</P>
<P>
 Although partisanship was much less evident at the Senate hearings than it had 
been in the House, a heated exchange of political charges occurred as Cutler 
clashed with Sen. Christopher S. Bond (R-Mo.), when the latter characterized 
the Clinton Administration aides who have testified over the last week as 
people who "cut corners, shaved the truth and lied" and suggested that 
documents might have been shredded. 
</P>
<P>
 Visibly angry, Cutler called Bond's characterization unfair and reminded the 
senator that his party had been responsible for Watergate and the Iran-Contra 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
 In the House, meanwhile, Breslaw tried to take the offensive to explain her 
role in the RTC's handling of its investigation into Madison Guaranty. While 
not denying that she made the statements secretly recorded in Kansas City by 
RTC investigator Jean Lewis, she charged that Lewis and others in the Kansas 
City office appeared to be working together to trap her into saying something 
that would prompt questions about her involvement in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Breslaw said that when she visited Kansas City to determine the status of the 
case, Richard Iorio, a supervisor in the criminal investigations office in 
Kansas City, took her to lunch with several other investigators and "encouraged 
me to drink alcohol. I declined." 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, she added, Iorio repeatedly urged her to meet privately with 
several investigators, including Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 "In retrospect, it was odd that Mr. Iorio went to such lengths to escort me to 
the offices of his staffers and then purposefully left us alone to talk," 
Breslaw said. "It is possible that he was aware that one or more of his 
employees' offices were bugged but did not want his own voice recorded," she 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 "While I was in Kansas City, no one informed me that our conversation was 
being recorded," she noted, referring to her discussion with Lewis. "Moreover, 
Ms. Lewis went out of her way to make the conversation appear casual. . . . She 
encouraged me to sit on the sofa in her office and did not take notes of our 
discussion." 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis and other investigators from Kansas City declined to testify at Friday's 
hearing to respond to Breslaw. Lewis, who was asked to testify by Rep. Henry B. 
Gonzalez (D-Tex.), chairman of the House panel, said that she wants to wait 
until the scope of the hearings is expanded to allow her to discuss the entire 
Whitewater case.

RWANDA EXILES ENDURE FIGHTS, CUTOFF OF FOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BALZAR, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Food supplies to about 250,000 refugees at this sprawling Hades were suspended 
Friday and fatal gunfire broke out at another camp as tensions boiled over 
between destitute Rwandans and predatory Zairian soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Relief workers said they feared for their safety in this camp, 40 miles from 
the city of Goma. They halted trucks that were to carry 220 tons of food, 
compounding the despair of the men, women and children in this diseased, hungry 
and thirsty site, where each person can claim perhaps only a square yard of 
space in the dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees pleaded 
with Zaire to bring its soldiers under control. Relief workers and officials 
from the U.N. agency met into the night to decide whether aid convoys would 
resume this weekend. If not, the stacks of bodies that still line the road here 
are sure to grow higher by the day. 
</P>
<P>
 At the even larger Kibumba camp 15 miles south of here, a dozen soldiers in 
Zairian uniform opened fire Friday on a mob of refugees, killing one elderly 
man and wounding three others, including a 6-year-old, relief officials said. 
They said the soldiers were raiding the camp along the road, looting what few 
blankets and possessions the Rwandans had. Refugees surrounded them in a 
throng. 
</P>
<P>
 The soldiers shot their way out, spreading fear and anger through the 1 
million or so ragtag remnants of the once-ruling Hutu majority of Rwanda now 
encamped in this region. 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation is getting really out of control," said Panos Moumtsis, 
spokesman for the U.N. refugee agency. And the only people who can bring order, 
he said, are Zairian officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, they need to discipline their soldiers," he said. "Instead of 
imposing order, they are the ones causing all the trouble. Security is very, 
very bad. Relief workers fear for their security." 
</P>
<P>
 That tensions would boil over seems inevitable given the volatile conditions 
here. Zairian soldiers are paid almost nothing and have long been accustomed to 
creating a salary by extorting money and goods from citizens, Goma residents 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Added to that corrupt atmosphere has been the enticement of vulnerable 
refugees, with their money and meager possessions protected by nothing more 
than grass huts barely bigger than dog houses or frail tents of plastic 
sheeting. And consider that great territorial animosity already existed between 
Zairians and Rwandans along the border. 
</P>
<P>
 "They need food up there every day -- we're very concerned," Jillian Hazell of 
the World Food Program in Goma said of conditions in Katali and surrounding 
areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Relief officials said they did not know how long refugees here could manage 
before hunger added to the miseries of disease and dehydration. Most relief 
workers stayed clear of the camp Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A few journalists entered the area, but it was impossible to determine the 
extent of food stockpiles. One man displayed a bowl of grain, another a 
six-gallon jug of beer fermented from bananas. But a family of six lying in the 
uncovered frame of their tent had only the food that was boiling on a smoky 
campfire at that moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Squeezing among the multitudes at the camp, one could see a child eating sugar 
cane, a woman selling a small stalk of green bananas, a small mound of potatoes 
inside a tent. But there were many more empty pots than full ones; every third 
refugee interviewed said he had been accosted by soldiers in Zairian uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 "Always soldiers take money from people, and their food," said an agitated 
refugee wearing a sweaty, crusty T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Bakundufite, a 22-year-old student, said he was roughed up and robbed 
when he tried to sell the books he brought with him on his flight from Rwanda: 
"A soldier took one book. I asked him to give it back. He took another. I asked 
for it back. I was beaten." 
</P>
<P>
 Relief workers, refugees and Zairian soldiers all agreed the trouble is 
occurring close to the road, not in the heart of the camps. Deep among the 
throngs of refugees, soldiers fear to venture; after a dispute Thursday, one 
soldier was hacked to death by a mob wielding machetes. Relief officials said 
the soldier was trying to extort money from a refugee and was disarmed of two 
rifles. Both weapons remained in the hands of angry refugees Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a UNICEF worker reported he came across the bullet-riddled body of 
a refugee along the road Friday. Other refugees said the man resisted giving 
his motor scooter to a soldier and was shot. 
</P>
<P>
 These isolated shooting deaths, of course, continue to pale compared with the 
toll of Rwandans falling to disease -- perhaps 700 on any given day, maybe 
15,000 or more since the Rwandan Patriotic Front, dominated by minority Tutsis, 
won its sharp, bloody civil war last month. 
</P>
<P>
 As fast as collection trucks could scoop up bodies placed on the roadside 
Friday, more were lugged in to replace them. Some were wrapped in mats, others 
naked. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, quickly along the road and through the camps, dirty rugs were spread on 
the dirt as impromptu merchants resold the shoes of the dead.

EMPLOYEES LIKELY TO PAY MORE UNDER HEALTH REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT A. ROSENBLATT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Workers are paying more every year from their own pockets for health care 
coverage, and any reform legislation likely to come out of Congress seems 
almost certain to accelerate this trend. 
</P>
<P>
 At corporations that provide their workers with comprehensive coverage, the 
company now typically pays 80% and the worker 20% of doctor and hospital bills. 
The health reform legislation ultimately signed by President Clinton could set 
a minimum company support level of only 50% and many experts believe that some 
companies might turn that floor into a ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan proposed by Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) and 
embraced by Clinton would give American business several years to achieve 
coverage for all on a voluntary basis. Only if that did not work would 
companies be forced to offer health insurance and split the cost evenly with 
their workers. If this 50-50 proposal becomes law, it would be an invitation to 
business to pay less themselves and make their workers pay more, predicted 
Richard Brown, director of the UCLA Center for Health Policy Research. He 
forecast a "sharp decline" in the corporate share of payments above 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not a natural reason for 80-20, it just evolved that way," said 
Jonathan Gruber, an MIT economist specializing in jobs and health care issues. 
He suggested that, if the Mitchell bill becomes law, the employer's share could 
easily shift toward 50%. 
</P>
<P>
 The big firms with blue-chip benefits -- national companies such as General 
Electric, Xerox and General Motors -- would be much slower to move downward 
toward the new standard, experts believe. Traditions would deter some of the 
corporate giants. Union contracts would stymie others. 
</P>
<P>
 In this era of corporate downsizing, however, a growing percentage of 
Americans work at smaller companies. And it will be much easier for management 
at those firms to announce that the pattern of tomorrow's health insurance 
coverage will follow the new standard proposed from Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration, which initially asked Congress to make businesses pay 80% 
of the cost of health insurance, has embraced Mitchell's bill, with its 50-50 
provision, as a concession to small and low-wage businesses that offer no 
health insurance now. Small businesses had argued that they could not afford 
the 80% mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 More than that, Mitchell's bill would not require employers to provide 
insurance until 2002. Even then, the 50% employer mandate would kick in only in 
states where the bill's other provisions, designed to encourage businesses to 
provide insurance voluntarily, had not boosted the percentage of residents with 
health coverage from about 85% now to at least 95%. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these concessions, however, Clinton still faces an uphill fight merely 
to persuade a majority of his own party in the House and Senate to approve any 
government-mandated coverage at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The House bill, assembled by Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), 
would require most companies to provide health coverage almost immediately and 
pay fully 80% of the cost. A mandated employer contribution of this magnitude 
has attracted stiff opposition from small business and is given practically no 
chance of surviving in the final health reform bill. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Clinton still faces an uphill fight merely to persuade a majority of 
his own party in the House and Senate to approve any government-mandated 
coverage at all. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, for example, Sen. Bob Kerrey of Nebraska, an influential moderate 
Democrat, delivered a stinging rebuff to the White House, saying he would not 
support the Democratic leadership health plans offered in either house of 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "The road the President is asking us to travel takes us to a place where 
federal spending on health care entitlements will have displaced even more of a 
dwindling pool of household savings," Kerrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before health care became a major topic of conversation on Capitol Hill 
and in the White House, American businesses were striving to control the 
runaway costs of the health care that they offered their workers. 
</P>
<P>
 With health care inflation rising much faster than the general price level, 
companies have been under a squeeze, with more of their revenue absorbed by the 
expenses of medical costs for their workers. Even after adjusting for 
inflation, corporate spending on health care per employee rose more than 
fivefold between 1965 and 1991, according to the Employee Benefit Research 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Money that could have gone into wages or profits was channeled instead into 
health insurance premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporations began their own health cost-control measures gingerly in the 
early 1980s by asking workers to get second opinions before surgery and by 
reviewing employees' medical records before insuring them. When these steps 
proved ineffectual, companies became much more aggressive in demanding that 
workers shoulder more of the financial burden of their health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers "are being asked to contribute more and more," noted Paul Fronstin, 
research associate at the institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Changes have been sudden. In 1988, an overwhelming 72% of persons covered by 
private health insurance enjoyed the luxury of selecting any doctor for 
treatment. By 1992 that figure had shrunk to 46%. 
</P>
<P>
 The switch has been to "managed care," which limits sharply the choice of 
doctors. The biggest increase has been in so-called "point of service plans," 
where the patient gets a bargain rate, perhaps just $5 or $10 a visit, for 
going to a doctor in a network approved by the insurer. Picking a doctor 
outside the approved network means paying much more money out of pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 At many companies, money is deducted from paychecks to help pay for insurance 
premiums. The average monthly contribution for family coverage, $60 as recently 
as 1988, had increased to $97 by 1991, the last year for which comprehensive 
data is available, according to a study by the benefits institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Another cost-shifting technique comes from increasing the out-of-pocket 
maximum that a family can pay per year in medical bills before insurance 
reimburses for all expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, according to a study by the benefits institute of firms with more 
than 100 workers, the average maximum expense for a family was $2,004. This 
out-of pocket limit rose to $2,300 in just three years, meaning that the family 
was responsible for another $300 a year.

 HELTER SKELTER: First, man on the Moon, then Manson -- 1969 was some summer. 
Tuesday marks the 25th anniversary of the most famous murders in local history, 
at least pre-Simpson (A1). . . . Manson and his followers planned the murders 
at Spahn Ranch in Chatsworth, the old movie set. But you can't see it now. It 
burned down in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 SAVE THE BOOKS: You can't fight City Hall. But you can certainly march there, 
which is what Judith Babka, manager of the San Fernando Public Library, plans 
to do on Aug. 15. Her goal: To save the library from going under (B2). . . . 
The branch, which opened in 1914, was the first free public library in the 
Valley. Without more funds, the library will only buy five to 10 magazine 
subscriptions a year. 
</P>
<P>
 LESS FAITH: Nobody doubts the Christian Right has become a big player in 
American politics. But according to a Glendale-based survey, the percentage of 
ardent believers is, actually, going down (B1). . . . George Barna (above), who 
conducted the poll, also found that 72% of U.S. adults believe "there is no 
such thing as absolute truth." That's a 5% increase since he asked the question 
in 1991.

 OTHER TOUR: When the relatives come in from back East, where do you take them 
to catch a little Hollywood? Universal City Studios, naturally. But that's not 
the only studio in the Valley to offer tours. This week, Warner Bros. in 
Burbank expanded its tours from six to 16 a day. . . . Spokesman David Horowitz 
says business has gone up 60% this summer. "It's not a secret anymore," he 
said.

 ON CALL AGAIN: Guy Sularz has always been a role player. In baseball, the 
North Hollywood grad filled in all around the infield. And, these days, as a 
Phoenix firefighter, he rotates from station to station (C10). . . . As a 
ballplayer, Sularz made it to the big leagues briefly with the San Francisco 
Giants. But he spent most of his career in the minors. Michael Arkush

MARRIAGE; WITH NO DIVORCE, CHILE VOWS LAST 'UNTIL DECEIT DO US PART' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Divorce, Chilean-style, is a fraudulent affair in which the couple, their 
lawyers and witnesses lie to a judge who knows they are lying but pretends to 
believe them. Everyone agrees that the municipal registrar who officiated the 
marriage ceremony acted without authority because (wink) the bride and groom 
resided outside his jurisdiction. Thus the marriage is annulled, perhaps many 
years and many children after the fact. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of such bogus annulments are decreed each year in Chile, one of the 
few countries in the world that have no law allowing for divorce. But this 
year, the issue has become a topic of national debate, and many Chileans are 
determined that a divorce law will be enacted -- while others are staunchly 
opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 The arguments from both sides touch on the moral fibers of this predominantly 
Roman Catholic nation, whose conservative cultural traditions are rapidly 
changing with economic and social development. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Socialist Party and the Party for Democracy, which share power 
in President Eduardo Frei's coalition government, are drafting a divorce bill 
to be submitted to Congress. Their plans have been heralded by blaring fanfare 
in the press. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, opponents of divorce are conducting their own media 
campaign, strongly backed by most of the country's Catholic bishops. Bishop 
Orozimbo Fuenzalida of San Bernardo has called on Catholics to join a prayer 
crusade of "500,000 rosaries" for the unity and sanctity of marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our fatherland, the sinister shadow of a divorce law threatens to weaken 
the sacred matrimonial bond," Fuenzalida declared. 
</P>
<P>
 Some church leaders have directed their message to the Congress, urging 
legislators to reject divorce. Some members of Congress have bridled at such 
lobbying. "The church can't impose what it thinks on the whole society," 
objected Congresswoman Maria Antonieta Saa. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, the church's position has prevailed. The first divorce bill to be 
presented in Chile was overwhelmingly defeated in 1914. Since then, at least 10 
other such bills have died. Most recently, several bills presented since the 
return of democracy after Chile's 1973-1990 military dictatorship failed to 
come to a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 But divorce legislation appears to have unprecedented support in the new 
Congress seated last March. Politicians are aware of public opinion surveys 
showing that about 70% of those polled favor a divorce law. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue puts Frei's Catholic-oriented Christian Democratic Party (CD), 
formerly a bulwark against divorce legislation, in an especially uncomfortable 
position. After numerous internal debates, Christian Democratic conclaves have 
failed to reach agreement either for or against a divorce bill. "Divorce 
Torments the CD Family," said a recent headline in the government newspaper La 
Nacion. 
</P>
<P>
 Frei said in his presidential campaign last year that a divorce law should be 
passed if that is what the country asks for. He has stayed out of the debate 
this year, but Josefina Bilbao, director of the National Women's Service, has 
said a divorce law "is necessary." 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of a divorce law say it is unjust to deny legal divorce to couples 
whose marriages have failed, and it is scandalous to substitute divorce with 
annulments based on obvious perjury. 
</P>
<P>
 Another subterfuge used by separated Chileans who want to remarry is to 
complete legal requirements, including publication of public notices, to have 
their first spouses declared missing and presumed dead. As a result of that 
practice, many Chileans have found at election time that they could not vote 
because they were legally deceased. Chileans on Divorce 
</P>
<P>
 A 1992 poll of Chileans found that 73.5% of those surveyed said they were 
Roman Catholic, and 17.2% of those Catholics said they attended church 
regularly -- once a week or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the Catholics surveyed who attended church regularly: 
</P>
<P>
 * 73% believed divorce should be legal in some cases. 
</P>
<P>
 * 24.5% believed it should never be legal.

FAMILY; POLISH LEADER JUGGLES DUTY TO HOME, COUNTRY; WITH ONE OF HIS SONS ON 
TRIAL AFTER A SCUFFLE WITH POLICE, PRESIDENT LECH WALESA FINDS THE BALANCE OF 
FATHERHOOD AND POLITICS INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT. SOME SAY HIS CHILDREN FEEL THEY 
ARE 'IMMUNE FROM THE LAW.' 
</P>

<P>
 It has never been possible for Polish President Lech Walesa to separate his 
public and private lives, despite a longstanding tradition in Poland of doing 
so. 
</P>
<P>
 As a Solidarity leader in the 1980s, his Gdansk apartment was also union 
headquarters, where journalists and political activists shared the same cramped 
space with Walesa, his wife and their eight children. 
</P>
<P>
 During his internment in 1982, his wife, Danuta, was thrust into the role of 
chief spokesperson. A year later, Danuta and the Walesas' eldest son, Bogdan, 
traveled to Norway to accept the Nobel Peace Prize because Walesa was afraid he 
would not be allowed to return to Poland if he left to collect the prize 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Family matters and Solidarity matters became inextricably mixed," Walesa 
wrote in his autobiography. "I'm fortunate, because I've been able both to be 
politically active and have a family." 
</P>
<P>
 But since becoming president and moving to Warsaw -- more than 200 miles from 
the family's home -- balancing fatherhood and politics has been increasingly 
difficult for the former shipyard electrician. The current trial in Gdansk of 
his son Przemyslaw, 20, serves as a telling example. 
</P>
<P>
 Last November, after learning that his wife-to-be was pregnant, Przemyslaw 
Walesa got drunk and went for a drive in his red Volkswagen. Unable to control 
the vehicle, he collided with two cars, fled the scene and led police on a 
high-speed chase. 
</P>
<P>
 When officers caught up with him, Przemyslaw allegedly resisted arrest and 
threatened to use his family connections to have them removed from their jobs. 
Police said the young Walesa was so unruly they had to cuff his wrists and 
ankles to protect him and themselves from injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Przemyslaw was charged with nine criminal counts -- seven stemming from his 
run-in with the police -- that carry a possible prison sentence of eight years. 
His trial, which recessed last week and continues late this month, has been a 
favorite of the Polish tabloids, but a source of anguish and embarrassment for 
Walesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial comes just a year after Przemyslaw's brother Slawomir, 21, received 
a two-year suspended sentence for striking and seriously injuring a pedestrian 
while driving recklessly on a Gdansk street. The woman now walks with crutches 
and has been unable to return to her teaching job. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a sad and dramatic matter for the whole family and the result of the 
several years of the father's absence from home," a presidential spokesman said 
after Przemyslaw's accident. "The son has attained maturity, and he must 
account for his deeds himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Since winning Poland's first presidential election 3 1/2 years ago, Walesa has 
been forced by circumstances into the role of weekend father, his family 
remaining in Gdansk. The Belweder Palace, where Walesa lived until recently, 
was too small for both his offices and his eight children, now ages 8 to 23, 
and uprooting them would have involved a huge disruption. 
</P>
<P>
 Walesa had just two rooms on the ground floor, and his quarters were so 
cramped that, during one visit, the family commandeered a room normally 
reserved for bodyguards. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-distance fatherhood has been made particularly trying for Walesa by an 
increasingly irreverent news media. Under communism, it was illegal for 
journalists to delve into the lives of politicians, but Poland's new -- and 
often brutal -- free market has extended to news and gossip about the First 
Family. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the public, there is a feeling that his family is acting as if they were 
immune from the law," said Grzegorz Lindenberg, editor of Super Ekspress, a 
splashy tabloid that chronicles the Walesas. "His family has been giving the 
president very bad press by association." 
</P>
<P>
 As Walesa serves the final year of his presidential term, he will have less 
difficulty spending time with his children when they visit Warsaw. After 
persuading Parliament to pay for renovations, Walesa left the Belweder in March 
and moved into a more spacious, 17th-Century palace. 
</P>
<P>
 He also seems to have mended ways with Przemyslaw, who got married in February 
and whose wife, Joanna, recently gave birth to Walesa's first grandson. 
</P>
<P>
 As a wedding gift, the president gave the young couple a new house.

ROSTENKOWSKI SEEKS DISMISSAL OF CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a legal maneuver that could delay the trial of Rep. Dan Rostenkowski 
(D-Ill.) until after the November elections, defense lawyers Friday challenged 
his indictment on corruption charges as an unconstitutional violation of the 
separation of powers doctrine. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Rostenkowski, former chairman of the House Ways and Means 
Committee, asked a federal court to dismiss the indictment or order a pretrial 
hearing on his constitutional claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the charges against the once-powerful Chicago Democrat, his lawyers 
argued, are matters for the House to decide, since they allege violations of 
internal House rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Former U.S. Atty. Dan K. Webb, chief defense attorney for Rostenkowski, said 
the Constitution's speech and debate clause protects members of Congress from 
being tried for conduct related to their legislative duties. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Atty. Eric H. Holder Jr., chief prosecutor for the government, has until 
Sept. 2 to file a reply. U.S. Distict Judge Norma Holloway Johnson is expected 
to hear arguments in the case in mid-September before making a ruling on the 
motions. If she rules against Rostenkowski, his lawyers could appeal that 
decision to the U.S. Court of Appeals. 
</P>
<P>
 A 17-count indictment issued on May 31 accuses Rostenkowski of 
misappropriating more than $640,000 in federal funds for personal use through a 
series of schemes, including the hiring of "ghost employees" who were paid for 
work they did not do, converting office stamp funds into cash that was used for 
personal spending and buying gifts for friends and relatives with office funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The congressman has pleaded innocent and is running for reelection to a 19th 
term in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 His former attorney, Robert S. Bennett, tried to negotiate a reduced plea. But 
Rostenkowski rejected the idea and hired Webb to mount an all-out fight against 
charges that threaten to end his career in disgrace. 
</P>
<P>
 "This indictment totally destroys one of the basic precepts that supports our 
constitutional form of governance -- separation of powers between the 
executive, judicial and legislative branches of our government," Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If allowed to stand, this indictment and any subsequent trial will compromise 
and erode the constitutionally vested right of Congress to make its own rules 
and discipline its own members." 
</P>
<P>
 The defense team requested access to any material in the hands of the Justice 
Department that might help to clear Rostenkowski of the charges and asked for a 
detailed "bill of particulars" providing names of his alleged accomplices.

EUROPEANS ALL HOT AND BOTHERED BY UNUSUAL WEATHER; HEAT WAVE: FARMERS FRET 
ABOUT CROPS, AND BEER SALES ARE UP. NORTHERN ASIA IS ALSO BAKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Usually, when people complain about the weather in this part of the world, 
they run on about gray skies, chills and a winter that never seems to end. 
</P>
<P>
 But now that much of Europe -- as well as northern Asia -- is in the midst of 
the worst heat wave in modern times, everybody from Korean rice farmers to 
Polish clergy are complaining about too much sun, too much heat, not enough 
rain. 
</P>
<P>
 The only ones not longing for the gloomy days of winter, it seems, are German 
vintners: The blazing sun has made the grape crop here ripen so fast that the 
harvest will be four weeks early. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the best it's been for grapes in southwestern Germany in many years," 
said Norbert Schindler, president of the Vintners' Assn. for the German state 
of Rhineland-Palatinate. "This will be the vintage of the century, just like 
1976." 
</P>
<P>
 Germany nearly broke its national record of 104.4 degrees last month when the 
temperature hit 103.8 in the eastern town of Preschen. This summer, Britain has 
racked up a record 197 hours of sun, sans rain. Tokyo set a new high of 102 
degrees on Wednesday, while seven other Japanese cities posted records of their 
own. On Friday, an unmanned measuring station in the Japanese city of Tenryu 
noted a temperature of 105 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 In Europe, the results of all this heat and light have included melting roads 
and railroad tracks, the fainting of 40 guests at a Buckingham Palace garden 
party, an increase in deaths by drowning and a continent-wide shortage of 
electric fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "You won't find one in all of Europe," said one fan company executive. 
</P>
<P>
 In Japan, air-conditioner sales tripled in July, and some store inventories 
have been wiped out. Japanese beer sales are up 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sweden, psychologist Curt Johanssen said it's too hot to think straight and 
warned, "In temperatures above 81 degrees, it's difficult to concentrate on 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Fittingly, in Berlin, employees of the Amerika Gedenk Bibliothek, a library, 
are being given hitzefrei -- special time off for heat relief, a privilege 
usually enjoyed only by children. 
</P>
<P>
 In Poland, soldiers who marched in recent ceremonies commemorating the 50th 
anniversary of the Warsaw Uprising, wearing heavy uniforms and leather gloves, 
dropped like a row of dominoes. This so alarmed Cardinal Josef Glemp, who was 
officiating at an outdoor Mass for the occasion, that he took the unusual steps 
of letting men wear hats and encouraging the faithful to remain seated during 
the reading of the Gospel. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in Poland, and in the Czech Republic, trains are being run at just 37 
m.p.h. between noon and 8 p.m. -- after officials noticed that tracks were 
bending in the heat when trains passed over them at higher speeds. 
</P>
<P>
 In Denmark, shoppers are being told to take thermometers to the supermarket to 
ensure that store refrigerators are keeping food fresh. And Danish social 
workers are blaming the heat wave for a 30% increase in children being left 
behind in bars by drunken parents. 
</P>
<P>
 In Brugge, Belgium, male inmates have complained that female prisoners are 
compounding their 87.9-degree heat-induced misery by sunbathing topless. 
</P>
<P>
 German prisoners haven't had anything quite so interesting to complain about: 
Prison officials in this country have offered inmates relief in the form of 
unlimited tea and drinking water; in Saarbruecken, prisoners are being allowed 
to have the food-tray slots in their cell doors left open longer than usual, 
just so some air can blow in. 
</P>
<P>
 About 15,000 Scandinavians have canceled vacations to Greece this summer, 
apparently because the North and Baltic seas are warm enough for bathing. 
Normally, the Baltic is so chilly that swimmers are known to wear bodysuits 
even in August; this summer, the water has risen to 73 degrees, and resulting 
algae blooms are making some swimmers break out in a rash. 
</P>
<P>
 Water levels in Central European lakes and reservoirs are still comfortably 
high, thanks to heavy spring rains. But the level of the important Elbe River 
has plunged, causing many ships to get stuck on their way from the Czech 
Republic to the North Sea. 
</P>
<P>
 And Japan -- which scientists say is caught in the same circular belt of warm 
air as Northern Europe -- is experiencing such severe water shortages that 235 
cities and towns have begun rationing. Tokyo's supply has been cut by 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 In Europe, water temperatures in lakes and rivers have risen so high that 
scientists say many species of freshwater fish are at risk. Already, the Rhine 
is 78.8 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's extremely high," said Paul Hagel, vice director of the Dutch Fishery 
Institute. "With temperatures over (86) degrees, most types of fish die in our 
bodies of water. The normal temperature for this time of year would be around 
(68) degrees." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials in southern Poland have reported large numbers of dead fish in 
rivers flowing from the Carpathian Mountains; fish farm workers have had to 
destroy seven tons of trout at just one overheated northern German lake. 
</P>
<P>
 To limit such fish kills, German utilities have been shutting down generating 
stations; otherwise, their coolant water would make the warm rivers even 
hotter. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Netherlands earlier this week, power companies called on citizens to 
use as little electricity as possible from 6 a.m. to 5 p.m. But locals didn't 
change their habits, so now the power plant in Rijswijk, near The Hague, has 
issued a threat: If customers don't cut energy consumption by Monday, the 
utility will turn off the power for one district each day. 
</P>
<P>
 The heat in Europe and Asia is creating havoc for farmers. Apples and plums 
are already falling off trees, even though they aren't yet ripe. Potato and 
corn crops are stunted. Sugar beets have collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 In South Korea, rice paddies have dried up and drought has become such a 
political issue that President Kim Young Sam recently appeared on television 
passing out buckets of water and spraying a parched rice paddy. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Sam Jameson in Tokyo, Scott Kraft in Paris, Dean E. Murphy

NEWS ANALYSIS; ALLIES HOPE ATTACK ADDS MUSCLE TO NATO THREAT; BALKANS: THE 
STRIKE AGAINST THE BOSNIAN SERBS WAS UNIMPORTANT MILITARILY, BUT WEST SEES 
SYMBOLIC VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Although the destruction of a Bosnian Serb antitank gun by U.S. A-10 attack 
aircraft Friday was of little real military consequence, the United States and 
its allies hope to get a big diplomatic bang from the NATO air strike near 
Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 The antitank gun, ancient and outmoded, was hardly very threatening. Bosnian 
Serb military strength in the war with the Muslim-led Bosnian government 
remains untouched. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Clinton Administration hopes that Friday's incident will add to what 
is becoming a cumulative message for the Bosnian Serbs -- that they have 
carried on their game beyond what the world is willing to take and are in 
danger of running out of cards to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The ways in which international pressure has intensified on the Bosnian Serbs 
include the allies' decision to embrace a single peace proposal; the agreement 
by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic to cut off aid to the Bosnian Serbs, 
and the decision by the major powers to vastly step up diplomatic pressure on 
the Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's air action, officials said, helped to increase that pressure and to 
lend a touch more credibility to the allies' threats to tighten enforcement of 
their weapons exclusion zones -- and perhaps lift the arms embargo on the 
Bosnian government -- if the Bosnian Serbs do not relent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not so much the air action but the climate in which it took place that's 
really important," a key Administration official said shortly after the air 
strike was announced. "We hope this will help send a message that we are 
serious in what we say." 
</P>
<P>
 Former Secretary of State Alexander M. Haig took a similar tack. "It's all 
part of a great(er) plan," Haig said in an interview Friday on CNN. The hope, 
he said, is that "all of these (will) combine with the air strike" to drive the 
message home. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the allies' strategy is fraught with uncertainties. In the immediate 
term, there is considerable suspicion about whether the Bosnian Serbs will keep 
their post-strike promise to return heavy weapons they took in a pre-dawn raid 
Friday. The answer to that should be evident today, the deadline set for the 
weapons' return. 
</P>
<P>
 There also is some nail-biting among Administration officials over whether 
Milosevic will follow through on his threat to cut off aid to the Bosnian Serbs 
if they continue to balk at the peace proposal. That, too, should be clear 
soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Key Administration officials were unable to say whether Russia will support 
the allies' decision to launch an air strike. Moscow almost bolted from the 
peace effort after a similar air action earlier this year, partly because it 
had not been consulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher made it clear Friday that no one had 
told the Russians in advance this time either. Christopher said he tried to 
call Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev on Friday afternoon but found 
that Kozyrev was on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, despite the additional pressures that Friday's air strike may 
have provided, there are no serious signs yet that the Bosnian Serbs themselves 
are prepared to give ground on the larger point and go along with the 
allied-backed peace proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some Western strategists suggested that, perversely, the Bosnian Serbs 
might even benefit from the attack if the specter of the allied air strike 
creates more sympathy among Serbs in Belgrade, undermining Milosevic's ability 
to hold firm on his promise to the allies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have to wait and see," one U.S. planner said. 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, the entire incident -- in which the Bosnian Serbs commandeered 
U.N.-held weapons and the North Atlantic Treaty Organizations warplanes 
retaliated -- was an opportunity for the allies, in more ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
 The West did not plan the NATO raid as part of any deliberate new allied 
policy. The attack came about only because the Bosnian Serbs violated the U.N. 
exclusion zone in a way that was too blatant for the allies to let pass. 
</P>
<P>
 The quick NATO response was not routine. It was possible because Yasushi 
Akashi -- the United Nations' cautious chief representative in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, who usually stands in the way of any military action on the 
part of the allies -- was on vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 The feeling at the Pentagon -- and at NATO headquarters in Brussels -- was one 
of elation. The military men had been frustrated over Akashi's refusal to allow 
their warplanes to do their job, and there was bitterness over the fact that 
NATO's credibility had been hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 To the extent that destroying an aging antitank gun restores NATO's 
credibility, even temporarily, then Friday's quick-response air strike can be 
considered a success, a U.S. policy-watcher said wryly. 
</P>
<P>
 But it may take months to see whether the action will have an impact that goes 
much beyond that.

 A military AN-12 turboprop that crashed in eastern Siberia, killing all 47 
people aboard, "simply missed the runway," an air force spokesman said. But 
other officials gave different accounts, including that the pilot failed to see 
a hill and that an engine caught fire. The crash in Bada reinforced concerns 
about the safety of air travel in Russia, where more than 270 people have died 
in accidents this year.

ANGRY CASTRO THREATENS TO LET CUBANS LEAVE

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cuban President Fidel Castro threatened Friday to let Cubans leave without 
restriction for the first time since the 1980 Mariel exodus allowed about 
120,000 Cubans to come to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In an angry reaction to disturbances in Havana, Castro said Cuba could not 
continue to stop people from leaving while Washington encouraged them to leave 
illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro said hijackers killed two police officers while trying to seize a 
ferryboat to flee Thursday night. Communist Party militants clashed Friday with 
protesters who looted some shops. 
</P>
<P>
 The riots followed at least three hijackings in the last 10 days of ferries by 
Cubans seeking to flee to the United States. The U.S. Coast Guard intercepted a 
U.S.-bound ferry hijacked Wednesday with 190 aboard; 76 asked to return home.

ZAPATISTA 'DEMOCRACY CONVENTION' TO PUSH FOR CHANGE; MEXICO: REBELS CALL 
MEETING TO DISCUSS DEMANDS FOR POLITICAL REFORM. SKEPTICS WRITE OFF THE 
GATHERING AS A PLOY TO REGAIN THE INITIATIVE BEFORE THE ELECTION. 
</P>

<P>
 This weekend could be either Woodstock without music or the most important 
strike for Mexican democracy in six decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The ragtag Indian fighters who marched out of the jungle Jan. 1 declaring war 
on the Mexican army have beat their guns into shovels. At the edge of the rebel 
wilderness stronghold here in the southern state of Chiapas, the Zapatista 
National Liberation Army has felled trees and dug terraces to build an outdoor 
auditorium the size of the Greek Theater for an audacious, non-military attack 
on the regime: a three-day convention to discuss what amounts to a peaceful 
overthrow of the government. 
</P>
<P>
 The rebels say they want to rewrite the constitution, but they will probably 
settle for a resolution demanding a clean election in the Aug. 21 presidential 
poll, placing their movement once again in the vanguard of Mexicans clamoring 
for democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 An impressive list of organizations has signed up to send more than 5,000 
representatives, and the government is providing transportation, food and 
logistic support for what in many countries might be considered a meeting of 
subversives. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Democracy Convention is the latest twist in an uprising that has 
evolved with the surrealism of a novel by Nobel laureate Gabriel Garcia 
Marquez. Since the initial 12 days of fighting, which left at least 150 people 
dead, the rebellion has become increasingly unconventional and inextricably 
enmeshed in election-year politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Zapatistas in ski masks and red bandannas initially captured the national 
imagination and international headlines with their demands for democracy and 
decent living conditions in their impoverished region. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the world's attention has moved on to bloodier uprisings, and in 
Mexico the cry for democracy is now heard most clearly through the voices of 
intellectuals and politicians in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zapatistas are surrounded militarily and increasingly isolated 
politically. They are largely forgotten by everyone except the angry ranchers 
whose land lies within territory that the guerrillas still hold. Military 
intelligence indicates that divisions are emerging within the rebel ranks, as 
some members insist on the kind of national political reform that this 
weekend's convention envisions, while others want to take advantage of the 
government offer of economic development programs for their region. 
</P>
<P>
 Both economic and political issues were included in the rebels' original list 
of demands. In the ensuing months, the economic demands have produced concrete 
proposals from the government with timetables for performance, while the 
political concerns have remained vague and were pointedly ignored in the 
government's peace offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Against that backdrop, skeptics write off the convention, which begins today, 
as a rebel ploy to regain the initiative before what promises to be the most 
closely contested presidential election in Mexican history. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is just more politics; it has all been politics," one high-ranking 
Mexican army officer said nonchalantly in a rare conversation with a reporter. 
"This is a political situation, not a military one. They are trying to keep 
themselves in the public eye, shouting that they are still alive. I don't 
believe that this will come to much." 
</P>
<P>
 The chairman of the conservative National Action Party dismissed the gathering 
as a "a leftist Tower of Babel." Nevertheless, other politicians say privately 
that they will be watching the turnout as a measure of rebel support across the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Even within the rebel ranks, the purpose of the convention is muddled. 
</P>
<P>
 Communiques inviting civic groups to attend said: "The National Democratic 
Convention is an effort to peacefully organize the society against the (ruling) 
party and for the transition to democracy, liberty and justice. It is an 
organized and peaceful effort to reach a government of transition to democracy 
and a new constitution for our Mexico." 
</P>
<P>
 But rank-and-file Zapatistas speak of less ambitious goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a chance for us to share experiences with organizations in the 
north, Oaxaca and Guerrero," two other impoverished southern states, said 
Valentin, a Zapatista leader here in San Miguel, a village of wooden huts with 
dirt floors at the edge of rebel-held territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Guadalupe Tepeyac, the village nearest the convention site, San Miguel 
has no electricity and no hospital. Since the cease-fire, a Red Cross team has 
been posted here, providing better emergency care than nearby villages ever 
enjoyed before. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can join forces and coordinate efforts," Valentin said, squatting beside a 
makeshift roadblock of three logs that guards one of the two main entrances 
into a rebel-controlled area about half as big as Orange County. He is not 
talking about coordinating armed attacks on military targets, but rather 
jointly marketing coffee and sugar while pressuring the government to pay 
attention to the problems of peasant farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want money," he said, explaining why the government's year-old 
agricultural subsidies program is not the solution. "We want work." 
</P>
<P>
 The seven months of the cease-fire have been difficult, complicating 
transportation problems for villages where the nearest dirt road can only be 
reached after hours of hiking over muddy paths. Zapatista guards cut off trucks 
and cars at San Miguel and Guadalupe Tepeyac, but the perimeter of the 
rebel-held zone is far from sealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Security inside the village also has become less rigid. Although Zapatistas 
still ask that their last names not be used, many who once covered their faces 
for pictures now invite a photographer to take their portraits. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why should we be afraid?" said Gustavo, a Zapatista. "The government knows 
who we are. Let them come after us. Either we will die or they will die. Then 
we will see who knows how to fight." 
</P>
<P>
 A rival peasant group that refused to take up arms has turned over detailed 
information about the Zapatistas to the Mexican army. Soldiers said they have 
an exact count of how many rebels are in each village and who their leaders 
are, thanks to the head of the pacifist group, who is also the ruling party's 
congressional candidate in the district that includes the rebel stronghold. 
</P>
<P>
 Since mid-January, the role of the 10,000 troops sent to Chiapas has been 
confined to gathering information and manning roadblocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Army officers said their orders are to allow unarmed travelers complete 
freedom to move about the area. "We have our mission to protect the towns and 
keep order," said an officer, who spoke on the condition his name not be used. 
"Good soldiers leave politics to the politicians." 
</P>
<P>
 The people most frustrated with the standoff are the ranchers whose lands the 
rebels occupy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been waiting seven months for a solution," said Jorge Constantino 
Kantor, whose 136-acre cattle ranch is behind Zapatista lines. "What kind of a 
game are they playing?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks after the uprising, the young rancher was often characterized as 
a reactionary symbol of the problems that led to the uprising. But lately, his 
ideas have gained sympathy as a backlash has developed against the rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been elected head of the regional ranchers and property owners 
association and was nominated as a ruling party candidate for the Mexican 
Congress but decided not to run. He now leads a sit-in of ranchers at the state 
capitol in Tuxtla Gutierrez. 
</P>
<P>
 The protesting ranchers' ranks have been reinforced as squatter groups 
inspired by the Zapatistas have invaded an estimated 300 ranches in the state 
outside the guerrilla-held area. In addition, merchants who depend on the 
ranchers for business have also demonstrated support. They estimate business is 
down 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 Since May, the government has paid ranchers $6 an acre per month in 
compensation for occupied land. But that is far from the solution the ranchers 
want. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want a return to the rule of law," Constantino Kantor said. "Marcos has 
been painted as some sort of Robin Hood. Well, this is not Sherwood Forest. 
This is my ranch."

CANDIDATE VOWS REFORM OF MEXICO RULING PARTY; ELECTIONS: THE PRI'S ERNESTO 
ZEDILLO PLEDGES TO SEPARATE THE POLITICAL ORGANIZATION FROM THE GOVERNMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the 65 years that Mexico's ruling party has maintained a stranglehold on 
power, the succession process has come to be known simply as "the finger" -- 
the anointing by sitting presidents of every political candidate from mayor to 
presidential hopefuls in closed party sessions that rendered elections little 
more than formalities. 
</P>
<P>
 But this week, with less than three weeks before the most hotly contested 
presidential race in more than six decades, Ernesto Zedillo, the ruling party's 
candidate, vowed to cut off the rite. 
</P>
<P>
 Laying the cornerstone of a startling crusade to reshape the authoritarian 
image of his long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party, Zedillo unveiled 
sweeping proposals that would, in effect, revolutionize and deinstitutionalize 
the PRI. 
</P>
<P>
 In a major address to party leaders, played back to the Mexican people with a 
sense of national amazement Friday -- one tabloid declared in towering 
headlines: "The End of the Finger!" -- Zedillo vowed to separate the ruling 
party from the government for the first time in six decades. 
</P>
<P>
 He promised that, if elected, he will cede wide powers to states, 
municipalities and the new legislature that also will be elected Aug. 21. He 
called on his party to open up its secretive process of selecting candidates, 
particularly in future presidential races. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be emphatic in my commitment that . . . I am resolved not to 
intervene, in any way, in the process of selecting candidates for the PRI," 
said Zedillo, 42, who was himself chosen in a closed-door party meeting after 
Luis Donaldo Colosio, the then-PRI presidential aspirant, was assassinated at a 
March campaign rally. 
</P>
<P>
 Declaring "now is the hour of democracy," he indicated that, amid strong 
challenges from two of eight opposition parties contesting the elections, the 
PRI now has little choice but to modernize and liberalize from within. 
</P>
<P>
 One illustration of the depth of Zedillo's proposed changes -- and the 
widespread suspicion that accompanied them -- was contained in a story Friday 
in Mexico's respected daily La Jornada. It described the scene at a campaign 
rally in the state of Chihuahua. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody believed it -- and few do believe it," the paper reported. "The PRI 
party faithful, the journalists and politicians high and low murmured 
incredulously, 'Zedillo cut off his finger.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Zedillo, who holds an economics doctorate from Yale, made it clear he is 
serious about the reforms; most Mexican political analysts say they are vital 
if the PRI is to fend off the most strident electoral challenge to its rule 
since 1929. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point after his Mexico City speech, a group of journalists tried to 
joke with Zedillo about the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "How is your wound?" one asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "What wound?" Zedillo replied. 
</P>
<P>
 "The finger. You cut it this morning." 
</P>
<P>
 "You journalists never take anything seriously," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Zedillo's image-makers and the reform-minded factions in his diverse, 
amorphous party are taking his pledges seriously. His speech was just one of 
several major offensives the PRI is launching in the final phase of the 
grueling campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 With polls showing Zedillo leading by only a narrow margin over his closest 
rival, Diego Fernandez de Cevallos of the center-right National Action Party, 
and reflecting strong gains by the campaign of Cuauhtemoc Cardenas and his 
center-left Democratic Revolutionary Party, the PRI this week unveiled a 
sophisticated multimedia package to cast itself as architect of Mexico's 
transition to multi-party pluralism and true democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, there have been previous -- unsuccessful -- efforts at reform. 
Colosio, while party chairman, tried to introduce a system of primary 
elections. But party hard-liners -- who are likely to oppose Zedillo on the 
issue as well -- rejected Colosio's proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest campaign includes a 45-minute video that was to be shown Friday to 
party members. 
</P>
<P>
 Titled "The PRI and Mexican Democracy," the video asserts the party "has been 
the principal player in creating a modern multi-party system" and "is the first 
party interested in carrying out a legal, transparent and easily verifiable 
electoral process." 
</P>
<P>
 The presentation also stresses that the PRI has won elections not through 
corruption -- as many Mexican voters suspect -- but because it is the only 
truly national party with support in every state, village and city block. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo's senior campaign aides said the pitch is designed for internal and 
external consumption; one campaign official said the video was being 
distributed to all party workers to embolden them against accusations of 
corruption and electoral fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that a package containing the videocassettes and a booklet by the 
same name, also translated into English and French, will be given to the 
hundreds of foreign observers the Mexican government will allow to monitor the 
election for the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 The new pitch also reflects the radical change in tone in Zedillo's speech to 
the party Thursday. Among the reasons for the PRI's survival, the package 
states, is the party's ability to transform and reform itself, noting its 
executive committee has had 31 presidents in its 65 years in power. "This is 
the way Mexico has prevented political oligarchies," it asserts, "and permitted 
a natural generational change in its leadership." 
</P>
<P>
 But in a comment typical of the skeptical reaction to Zedillo's speech, 
opponent Fernandez told reporters at a campaign stop Friday in Poza Rica in the 
state of Veracruz: "He must resign because he is a product of the finger."

DISPUTE THREATENS OBSERVATORY PROJECT IN CHILE; ASTRONOMY: LEGAL WRANGLING 
IMPERILS PLAN FOR THE WORLD'S MOST POWERFUL TELESCOPE IN THE ATACAMA DESERT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM R. LONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The clear, dry skies of the Atacama Desert in northern Chile make it a superb 
place to install the world's most powerful telescope. A $500-million European 
project to do just that is threatened, however, by roiling clouds of legal 
uncertainty and political turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
 If the problems are not resolved soon, a spokesman for the project said, the 
telescope could go to another country, perhaps Namibia. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no trouble in sight when Chilean Gen. Augusto Pinochet signed a 
"supreme decree" in 1988 donating 280 square miles of desolate Atacama land for 
an observatory to be built by a scientific consortium of eight European 
governments. It was only after Pinochet's military dictatorship ended in 1990 
that the clouds rolled in. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawsuits over land titles have challenged Pinochet's right to give away the 
land. An investigative committee of Chile's Congress has added more legal 
questions and controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 Work is well under way on the observatory. The European countries have spent 
about $30 million building roads, leveling the top of an 8,600-foot mountain 
and laying massive foundations. In Europe, grinding and polishing has begun on 
four identical telescope mirrors that are eight meters, or 315 inches, in 
diameter. 
</P>
<P>
 The project's scientific significance is far-reaching. The giant mirrors, to 
be linked electronically and used as a single telescope, together will have the 
light-gathering capacity of a single 16-meter mirror -- more powerful than any 
other telescope on Earth. Astronomers hope that the unmatched combination of 
light-gathering power and the immaculate skies of the Atacama, one of the 
world's driest deserts, will allow them to peer deeper into the cosmic distance 
than ever before. 
</P>
<P>
 The countries participating are Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, the 
Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. They form the European Southern 
Observatory, or ESO, which already operates a major cluster of telescopes on a 
Chilean mountaintop called La Silla. La Silla is near La Serena, 300 highway 
miles north of Santiago, and is a close neighbor to two important American-run 
observatories, La Campana and Tololo. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, those observatories make Chile the leading astronomical center for 
viewing parts of the universe that are best seen from the Southern Hemisphere. 
But if the new ESO project were taken to another country, Chile's preeminence 
could be overshadowed. 
</P>
<P>
 The mountain where construction has begun, known as Paranal, was part of 
neighboring Bolivia until Chile seized it in the 1879 War of the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Heirs of Adm. Juan Latorre, a historic Chilean figure in that war, claim in 
their 1993 suit that their title to property on the slopes of Paranal dates 
back more than a century. Pinochet's 1988 "supreme decree" donated the mountain 
and surrounding land to ESO as government land. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1977 law passed by the military government had declared two townships of 
former Bolivian territory as Chilean government lands. But Latorre's heirs say 
the 1977 law failed to comply with a legal requirement that private property in 
the townships be excepted from government ownership. Two private companies 
claiming land in the area have filed similar suits. 
</P>
<P>
 In March a judge ordered work to stop on the disputed site. The observatory 
project was paralyzed for 27 days until a new court order allowed it to resume. 
</P>
<P>
 The final outcome of the suits remains in doubt. Such legal disputes in Chile 
have been known to drag on for years. The first telescope unit at Paranal is 
scheduled to be in operation by 1997, and the full battery of four mirrors is 
to be working in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
 The Foreign Ministry and ESO are hoping that the claims can be settled out of 
court, but agreement may be difficult. ESO has said the Chilean government is 
liable for any cost, but Latorre's heirs have said it is ESO that should pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the congressional committee investigating the observatory has 
raised further questions. There have even been allegations of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 ESO has operated its observatory at La Silla since long before the military 
took power in 1973. A 1963 treaty granted the observatory exemption from 
Chilean taxes and from Chilean court jurisdiction. Such diplomatic immunity is 
routinely granted to official international organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1986 exchange of letters between ESO and the Chilean Foreign Ministry, it 
was agreed that, for legal purposes, the planned Paranal observatory would be 
part of ESO's original observatory, and therefore would be covered by the 1963 
treaty provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the congressional investigative committee now say that one of those 
diplomatic documents appears to have been falsified. The Foreign Ministry 
insists the document is valid. 
</P>
<P>
 Criticism has come not only from former opponents of the military government, 
including members of current President Eduardo Frei's Christian Democratic 
Party, but also from members of the conservative opposition to Frei. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the committee also contend ESO's arrangement with the military 
regime would give the new observatory tax breaks worth $200 million. "I suspect 
corruption," Congresswoman Evelyn Mattei told a Chilean newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 ESO insists the Chilean government is responsible for handling all legal and 
political problems involving the donated land. "We received those lands from 
the government in good faith," Daniel Hofstadt, a Frenchman who is ESO's chief 
representative in Chile, said. 
</P>
<P>
 He emphasized that before the project can proceed much further, ESO needs "a 
clear guarantee" that all problems will be resolved. Without assurances "that 
we will have adequate conditions for proceeding," he warned, the project could 
be moved. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not what ESO wants," but "if the impediments continue and we see that 
we cannot go on in an adequate way, we will have to look for an alternative," 
Hofstadt said. ESO already is studying an alternative site in Namibia, which 
also has clear skies ideal for astronomy.

TOWN'S PROPPED-UP CELEBRITY LAID TO REST AT LAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a dead man, Henry (Speedy) Atkins gave people a lot of joy. 
</P>
<P>
 For 66 years, his well-preserved corpse -- used in an embalming experiment -- 
was a tourist attraction at a funeral home in this Ohio River town. 
</P>
<P>
 Townsfolk and the occasional busload of out-of-towners gawked at his mummified 
body, which was stored propped against a closet wall and carefully washed and 
dressed three times a year to keep mold off. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the people who cared for Speedy at Hamock-Bowles Services decided 
it was finally time for him to be laid to rest. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 people, some of whom posed for pictures beside his open coffin, bade 
him a rousing farewell with spirituals and sermons during a service at the 
Washington Street Baptist Church. 
</P>
<P>
 A bouquet of red carnations was placed atop the coffin in which Speedy lay 
dressed in a black tuxedo and bow tie. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came to Paducah a pauper, poor, homeless, a nobody," said the Rev. H. 
Joseph Franklin. "Today, he's going to be laid to rest at last, as a 
celebrity." 
</P>
<P>
 Little is known about Speedy's life except that he got his nickname by being a 
fast worker at a local tobacco factory and was in his 50s when he drowned in 
1928 while fishing in the Ohio River. No family came forward to claim the body. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral director A.Z. Hamock, who was fascinated by how the Egyptians 
mummified bodies, used his own experimental embalming fluid on Speedy to 
preserve the body and eliminate odor. The mixture turned Speedy's body a rusty 
color, his yellowed teeth visible through drawn-back lips in his gaunt face. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamock never revealed the secret formula. He died in 1949, leaving the 
business to his wife, Velma Hamock. 
</P>
<P>
 During the summer, Mrs. Hamock would dutifully take Speedy out of the closet 
for sightseers, free of charge. He also appeared on national television three 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 After Speedy's 66 years of glory, Mrs. Hamock decided, for no particular 
reason, enough was enough, and he ought to be buried. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Speedy's funeral, coffin and burial plot were all donated by businesses in the 
neighborhood where he once lived.

LETTER CLAIMS 'ZODIAC' KILLER HAS SHOT 5 MORE IN NEW YORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "This is the Zodiac." 
</P>
<P>
 Those words, in a childlike scrawl, became the trademark greeting of a killer 
who filled the New York summer of 1990 with dread. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after years of silence, the Zodiac killer may be back. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, the Zodiac vowed to kill one person for each of the 12 astrological 
signs. Stalking a neighborhood that straddles Queens and Brooklyn, he shot to 
death four men of four different signs, then abruptly quit. 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the New York Post got a similar note from someone claiming to be 
the Zodiac, and detectives are trying to determine if the letter writer is the 
killer or a copycat. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter writer claims responsibility for five shootings that police said 
left at least two people dead between Aug. 10, 1992, and June 11 of this year. 
All of the attacks took place in the general area of the 1990 shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 Police confirmed four of the attacks, including the two slayings, but said 
some details of the attacks in the letter do not match up. 
</P>
<P>
 Handwriting experts were comparing the note to the taunting letters that were 
sent to the Post and left at crime scenes by the Zodiac in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief of Detectives Joseph Borrelli said Friday there was no solid evidence 
linking the two sprees. 
</P>
<P>
 The new letter, written in red ink, begins: "This is the Zodiac speaking here 
it is," then lists five attacks. The writer also taunts police. A scoreboard 
shows the NYPD with a score of 0 and a sketched sad face; below is the Zodiac 
sign -- a circle with cross hairs -- with a happy face and a score of 9, the 
number of claimed shootings dating to 1990. "Sleep my little dead how we loathe 
them," the writer added. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest attacks deviate from the Zodiac's precise routine in 1990: He 
always struck on a Thursday, and always at intervals of 21 days or a multiple 
of 21. His notes also contained the astrological signs of his victims. Police 
never figured out how the shooter discovered their birth dates. 
</P>
<P>
 The new letter does not mention the victims' signs, although of the three 
known, one was a Leo, one a Libra and one an Aries -- all different from the 
previous victims.

CLINTON ACCUSES NRA OF BLOCKING VOTE ON CRIME BILL; LEGISLATION: HE SAYS GUN 
LOBBY IS RALLYING OPPOSITION TO HOUSE PROCEDURAL ACTION. BUT MOST REPUBLICANS 
AND 15 BLACK CAUCUS MEMBERS OPPOSE THE MEASURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, fighting to rescue an endangered crime bill, Friday accused 
the National Rifle Assn. of leading a campaign to block a vote on the 
$33-billion measure in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out there in the country where people know that crime strikes people without 
regard to race or political party, everybody is for this crime bill," Clinton 
said. "But here, the crime bill is stuck in a web spun by a powerful special 
interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clinton did not say so specifically, the gun lobby, which opposes the 
bill's assault weapons ban, is only part of the problem he faces in getting the 
legislation past its last procedural hurdle in the House -- a vote on how the 
bill will be debated. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual alliance, nearly all Republicans also appear ready to block the 
vote, along with 15 to 20 members of the Congressional Black Caucus -- who have 
balked at the final version of the bill because it no longer includes a 
provision that would have allowed Death Row inmates to challenge their 
sentences by using statistical evidence to show racial bias in the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Between the two sides, Clinton and his supporters have been hard-pressed to 
find the votes they need to get the bill through the last procedural vote in 
the House. The Senate is not scheduled to consider the bill until after the 
House votes. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's remarks, which came at a White House ceremony marking the 
first anniversary of congressional approval of his budget deficit-reduction 
act, were part of a White House strategy designed to generate public pressure 
on lawmakers by portraying the bill's opponents as unfairly using procedural 
tricks to prevent passage of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 If people oppose the crime bill on the merits, "let them vote against it. 
That's fine," Clinton added. "But do not let us pull another Washington, D.C., 
game here and let this crime bill go down on some procedural hide and seek. If 
we're going to have a shootout, let's do it in high noon, broad daylight where 
everybody knows what the deal is." 
</P>
<P>
 Tanya Metaksa, chief lobbyist for the NRA, defended the organization's efforts 
to block a vote, saying: "It is part of the way Congress works." 
</P>
<P>
 The President made his remarks after Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) and his 
lieutenants indefinitely postponed a preliminary vote on the House rule that 
sets the parameters for debate on the bill and allows a final vote to be taken. 
The bill cannot move forward until the procedural matter is settled. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Bill Richardson (D-N.M.), a chief deputy whip for the Democrats, said 
that the leadership is still 20 votes short of the 218 votes needed to approve 
the rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and Atty. Gen. Janet Reno telephoned members of Congress, hoping to 
swing undecided or doubtful lawmakers to the Administration's side as Foley put 
off a vote on the rule until sometime next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the White House strategy is to persuade Republicans to vote in favor 
of the rule that would allow the House to take up the crime bill. Especially 
targeted are those Republicans who advocate gun control measures like the 
weapons ban. Generally, Republican leaders have denounced the bill as too 
costly and not tough enough on violent criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Christopher Shays (R-Conn.) said that he is one of "about 10" GOP 
lawmakers who intended to vote for the rule because the crime bill would help 
crime-prone urban areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Shays said that defeat of the procedural step would lead to a weakening or 
removal of the assault weapons ban and not to an increase in spending for 
prisons or law enforcement that most Republicans favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Aides to GOP leaders said, however, that only a handful of the 178 House 
Republicans would vote to move the crime bill to the floor on grounds that it 
would waste billions of dollars on "social welfare programs" and would allocate 
too little money for prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote on the rule may pose a special problem for Rep. Mike Huffington 
(R-Santa Barbara), who is running for the Senate this year against Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein (D-Calif.), widely credited for moving the assault weapons ban 
through the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 If Huffington votes against consideration of the bill, he could be accused of 
siding with the NRA against a popular provision of the legislation. If he votes 
for the rule, however, he could incur the enmity of conservatives who oppose 
gun control legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Noting in his remarks that he was joined by hundreds of police officers last 
week to celebrate the approval of the Senate-House compromise on a crime bill, 
the President said: 
</P>
<P>
 "Unbelievably, after eight days, nothing has happened. . . . The National 
Rifle Assn. is trying to block the vote on the rule because they are against 
the assault weapons ban, because they know that a majority of the House and 
Senate will vote for this bill if it gets to a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "So they are trying to block the vote on the rule, hoping that people can hide 
and say: 'Well, I didn't really vote against the bill but there was something 
about the way it was coming up I didn't like.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The crime bill includes funding for 100,000 community-based police officers 
over a six-year period and $8.3 billion for more prisons. It would require life 
terms for three-time felons convicted of violent crimes and serious drug 
offenses.

ABORTIONS AT ONE PENSACOLA CLINIC RESUME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Security escorts wore donated bulletproof vests. A dozen anti-abortion 
protesters kept a vigil. And an out-of-town doctor was whisked through the 
front door after a diversion was created out back. 
</P>
<P>
 Abortions resumed Friday at the Pensacola Women's Medical Services clinic for 
the first time since an abortion doctor and his bodyguard were shot to death a 
week ago outside the city's only other abortion clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinic administrator Sandy Sheldon said 34 abortions were performed of the 53 
scheduled -- the normal no-show rate. The clinic normally performs abortions 
two to three days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things were very upbeat inside. The thing that we're laughing at the most are 
the protesters," Sheldon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. John B. Britton, 69, and 74-year-old James H. Barrett were killed July 29 
at The Ladies Center. Barrett's 68-year-old wife, June, who also helped escort 
abortion staff members and patients past demonstrators, was wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Hill, a former minister who advocates killing abortion providers, has 
been charged with murder and attempted murder. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second slaying of an abortion doctor in Pensacola in 17 months: Dr. 
David Gunn was shot to death in 1993 outside the Pensacola Women's Medical 
Services clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ladies Center clinic has indefinitely suspended abortions but is offering 
counseling and other services. The center's administrator, Linda Taggart, 
declined to comment Friday on when she expected abortions to resume there. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Pensacola Women's Medical Services clinic, a police officer whisked Dr. 
Allen Kline of Philadelphia in the front door after several staffers stepped 
out a rear door in what Sheldon said was an effort to distract the news media. 
</P>
<P>
 "Understandably, any of the physicians, they don't want to have any more of a 
high profile than absolutely necessary," she said. "They're risking their lives 
coming to the clinics." 
</P>
<P>
 Eight escorts, some wearing bulletproof vests provided by an anonymous donor, 
shielded patients from the demonstrators and news cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-abortion protesters, wearing suits and dresses, prayed and read Bible 
passages. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the press is here they get all dressed up and they leave their nasty 
signs at home," Sheldon said. "They are not shrieking at the patients. They are 
not yelling ugly things at us."

JUDGE TO RECONSIDER CITADEL HAIR ISSUE; COURTS: THE FIRST FEMALE CADET AT THE 
STATE-RUN MILITARY SCHOOL WINS A NEW HEARING. PRESIDING JURIST HAD RULED THE 
COLLEGE MAY SHAVE HER HEAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge agreed Friday to reconsider his decision letting The Citadel 
shave Shannon Faulkner's long brown hair when she becomes the military school's 
first female cadet. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge C. Weston Houck also said Faulkner, 19, can march with the 
cadet corps while the school appeals his ruling that its all-male admission 
policy is unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the college had not shown it was likely to win on appeal. Faulkner 
would suffer more harm if she were kept out than The Citadel would if she were 
allowed in, Houck said. 
</P>
<P>
 The state-supported school immediately asked the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of 
Appeals to block her entrance, Citadel spokesman Rick Mill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, Houck said the college could shave Faulkner's head as it 
does all male first-year cadets because he found no legal basis for different 
grooming standards based on sex. 
</P>
<P>
 But Atty. Gen. Janet Reno said Friday that the Justice Department filed a 
motion in U.S. District Court in Charleston, asking Houck to reverse or stay 
his decision pending an appeal to a higher court. 
</P>
<P>
 The motion argues that shaving her hair would "altogether denigrate Ms. 
Faulkner's identity as a woman," that courts have recognized differences for 
male and female police officers, and that the federal service academies also 
apply different rules to the sexes. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawes Cooke, the attorney representing The Citadel, said having Faulkner shave 
her head would enable her to fully enter into the culture of the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The first year at The Citadel is called "knob year" -- because of the shape of 
cadets' shaved heads, resembling doorknobs -- and involves a tradition that 
encourages obedience to older students. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it means is a symbolic relinquishing of individuality. Many cadets 
describe it as the most humiliating moment of their lives. For us to say to 
Faulkner that she be treated differently would hurt her chances for 
assimilation into the corps." 
</P>
<P>
 Houck set a hearing on the matter for Wednesday, five days before Faulkner is 
to enroll. 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner had no comment Friday. She has said she would submit to having her 
head shaved if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing does not mean Houck will change his mind but "we're very pleased 
with the development," said Sara Mandelbaum, an attorney from the American 
Civil Liberties Union, which is helping to represent Faulkner. 
</P>
<P>
 The motion by the Justice Department, which intervened on her side last year, 
also argued that Faulkner should not be segregated for her personal safety but 
allowed to be treated as any other cadet. 
</P>
<P>
 The words "Die Shannon" were painted on a sign recently, and safety is a 
concern of both sides in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether locks will be provided for her room has not been decided, but Houck 
said some provision should be made for her security. The Citadel agreed to lock 
side doors adjacent to Faulkner's room 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Faulkner was accepted to The Citadel after she asked a high school counselor 
to delete references to sex on her transcript. The school then rejected her 
after officials learned she was a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 She sued, and attended day classes under Houck's order last semester. 
</P>
<P>
 The Citadel, which has about 2,000 students, is one of only two 
state-supported all-male military colleges. The other, the Virginia Military 
Institute, also has been fighting a court battle over admission of women.

GOP BLOCKING HEALTH REFORM, FIRST LADY SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton on Friday accused Republican leaders of 
trying to kill health care reform to keep her husband from delivering on a 
campaign promise, and predicted they would pay at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with Mutual/NBC Radio News, the First Lady also said prospects 
for passage of a health care reform bill were "very good" despite efforts to 
block it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that unfortunately the Republicans don't want to pass health care 
reform because they don't want this President to fulfill yet another of his 
promises," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to the November midterm elections, when 34 of the 100 Senate seats 
and all 435 House seats are up for grabs, she said: "This is going to be a very 
interesting fall." 
</P>
<P>
 She predicted voters will punish Republican candidates "if after all this 
effort, after more than 60 years of trying, we fail to provide real health care 
reform because one party wants partisan political advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 The First Lady said compromises proposed by Senate Majority Leader George J. 
Mitchell (D-Me.) and House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) both 
meet the President's overall goals. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's bottom line, she said, is universal coverage, a ban on abusive 
insurance practices, choice of doctors and "paying for universal coverage with 
shared responsibility" -- a euphemism for having employers pay part of the tab.

SEA WORLD FREES GREAT WHITE SHARK AFTER 10 DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sea World on Friday released a great white shark back into the ocean after its 
capture 10 days ago drew heavy protests from animal activists. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-long young female shark, estimated to be 100 pounds, had not eaten 
since it was caught with a hook and line July 27 in the ocean off San Diego and 
put on display, said the marine park's curator, Jim Antrim. 
</P>
<P>
 That fact prompted the decision to let the shark go, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was still looking strong and healthy. We decided the best course was to 
put it back in the ocean now and fit it with a radio transmitter and monitor 
its movements," Antrim said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, animal rights groups protested when a great white shark captured 
and put on display at Sea World had to be euthanized after it failed to eat and 
its health steadily deteriorated. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups protested even more when the second shark was captured after the 
first one died. 
</P>
<P>
 No white shark has ever survived more than 16 days in captivity. More than a 
dozen have died in captivity at Sea World and other California aquariums in the 
last 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're happy they decided to do the right thing," Linda Kelson of San Diego 
Animal Advocates said late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think public opinion was definitely on our side on this one." 
</P>
<P>
 Sea World says it captured the two fearsome-looking creatures to increase 
scientific knowledge about them. 
</P>
<P>
 White sharks must swim continuously so that water moves through their gills, 
bringing them oxygen. But it's not clear why the sharks refuse to eat in 
captivity, Antrim said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blood samples taken from the shark before it was released into the ocean 
Friday and tissue samples taken from the shark that died earlier will aid 
researchers, Antrim said.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; BROWN CITES RISE IN JOBLESS RATE AS SIGN THAT 
STATE IS STILL IN RECESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL STALL, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Democrat Kathleen Brown said Friday that a new spurt in California 
unemployment demonstrates that the state is not emerging from the recession, as 
Republican Gov. Pete Wilson argues, but is suffering a "betrayal of the 
California promise and the California dream." 
</P>
<P>
 The state is languishing in the trough of a massive transition to a new form 
of economy without the smart leadership it needs to cope with a changing 
future, said Brown, the state treasurer and Democratic gubernatorial nominee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things are happening in California that are different than in other places," 
Brown told about 50 members of Leadership California, an organization of female 
executives, entrepreneurs, educators and others. 
</P>
<P>
 While California's unemployment rate increased from 8.3% to 9% during July, 
the national rate edged up only slightly to 6.1%. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson described the increase Friday as a "temporary statistical variation." 
The recovery continues, though it might not be spectacular, Wilson said, and 
"Californians are more confident about the future." 
</P>
<P>
 The governor added: "As California builds its way back to full economic 
recovery, I will continue to push for significant reforms in the business 
environment and maintain our commitment to lower taxes and cutting red tape. We 
need to continue to stimulate business growth as we come out of tough economic 
times." 
</P>
<P>
 After two weeks in which Brown and Wilson battled over crime issues, Brown 
returned to the central theme of her campaign during appearances in Southern 
California, which has been hit worse by the recession than the rest of the 
state. She gave a similar economics address at lunch Thursday to about 500 
members of the Hollywood Radio and Television Society. 
</P>
<P>
 She planned to carry the jobs and economy theme to stops in Bakersfield, 
Fresno and San Bernardino before flying to Washington for two days of fund 
raising and meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson is planning to address an anti-crime rally on the state Capitol grounds 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor might say the state is in a recovery, Brown said, "but I have to 
tell you I don't see it as a recovery. I see it as the betrayal of the 
California dream and the California promise." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who has proposed an economic stimulus package that is similar to 
Wilson's program in many respects, said Friday that Wilson's actions and 
promises are not enough. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 election presents a crossroads, she said, in which Californians must 
choose between investing in new programs "that are going to make us smarter," 
or going "back to the old way that California used to be." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a governor today who happens to think happy endings will take place 
if one just lets things go as they will. . . . Try telling that to the families 
that have been torn apart by this new economy. We need a governor who can 
explain what is happening, who lays out a strategy and then fights to bring it 
home." 
</P>
<P>
 In Long Beach on Friday, Brown said California is undergoing "the most 
dramatic economic revolution and transformation in history," driven by forces 
such as global competition, the end of the Cold War and declines in the defense 
and aerospace industries. 
</P>
<P>
 California's future rests with trade, tourism and new uses of technology, 
Brown said. The entertainment industry is a metaphor for the transition, she 
said, citing the development of technology in Northern California's Silicon 
Valley for the motion picture "Jurassic Park." 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown said it is disturbing to see such developments as a major film 
company deciding to build an animation studio in Arizona rather than in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "There begins the peeling away of what once was a California-only industry," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown accused the Wilson Administration of failing to understand the 
devastation experienced by families that have lost jobs in the economic 
transition. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're frightened. They don't understand it. They see their lives suddenly 
in chaos and spiraling out of control," Brown said. "And they don't know what 
their place will be in this new economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Unless the state can help them adjust to new jobs, it will wind up paying in 
terms of unemployment insurance, welfare and public health care, Brown said.

BUSINESS PACS SPENT 3 TIMES MORE THAN LABOR ON CONGRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Business political action committees donated $203 million to current members 
of Congress during the six years ending in 1993, more than three times as much 
as PACs linked to labor unions, the political watchdog group Common Cause 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Business outspent labor in donations to Democrats in the House of 
Representatives, $72.7 million to $57.5 million. The difference was even more 
lopsided in donations to Republicans, with businesses donating $58.8 million, 
compared to labor's $4.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, businesses outspent labor 2 to 1 on the Democratic side, $32.2 
million to $15.2 million. Business donated $39.8 million to Republicans, 
compared to only $1.5 million by labor groups.

2 ON PANEL NAMED TO BENCH BY GOP PRESIDENTS; JUDICIARY: THE THIRD IS AN 
APPOINTEE OF LYNDON JOHNSON. THEY WERE HANDPICKED FOR THE SELECTION OF 
INDEPENDENT COUNSELS BY REHNQUIST.

<P>
 The three appeals court judges on the special panel that appointed a new 
independent counsel in the politically charged Whitewater investigation Friday 
include two who were named to the federal bench by Republican presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 One, Judge David B. Sentelle of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia, is a native North Carolinian and avid supporter of conservative Sen. 
Jesse Helms (R-N.C.). 
</P>
<P>
 The other two, Judge Joseph Sneed of the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in 
San Francisco and Judge John Butzner of the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals 
in Richmond, are in their 70s and, with senior status, have only partial 
workloads. Sneed was named to the appeals court by President Richard Nixon and 
Butzner by President Lyndon B. Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges selected for two-year terms on the Division for the Purpose of 
Appointing Independent Counsels, an arm of the U.S. Court of Appeals, are 
handpicked by Supreme Court Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist from among the 
nation's federal judges. 
</P>
<P>
 One member of the panel must be from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 
District of Columbia, where newly selected independent counsel Kenneth W. Starr 
sat before President George Bush chose him to be solicitor general in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The law authorizing the panel expired at the end of 1992. The day before the 
law ran out, the panel -- consisting of the same three members who now sit 
there -- appointed special prosecutor Joseph diGenova to probe possible Bush 
Administration involvement in distribution of information from President 
Clinton's passport files. 
</P>
<P>
 With no independent prosecutor law in place, Atty. Gen. Janet Reno appointed 
Robert B. Fiske Jr. last January as special counsel to head up the Whitewater 
investigation. Congress reauthorized the independent counsel law earlier this 
year, and the special panel's decision Friday to replace Fiske with Starr was 
its first since then. 
</P>
<P>
 The only fully active judge among the three who now sit on the panel is 
Sentelle, 51, who was appointed to the D.C. appeals court by President Ronald 
Reagan in 1987 to replace Antonin Scalia, who was chosen to serve on the 
Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 On the appeals court, one of Sentelle's most noteworthy decisions came in 1991 
when he and other Republican appointees voted to reverse the convictions of 
Iran-Contra figures Oliver L. North, John M. Poindexter and Lyn Nofziger. 
</P>
<P>
 A commentator for American Lawyer magazine said that Sentelle and another 
panelist "made such strange law in one portion of their Nov. 15 decision in the 
Poindexter case that a cynic might suspect them of naked political animus." 
</P>
<P>
 Sneed, 74, has served on the 9th circuit appeals court since 1973. During 
Starr's days as a law student at Duke University in the early 1970s, Sneed was 
dean of the law school. Butzner, 76, has served on the 4th circuit appeals 
court since 1967.

TEXT OF ORDER APPOINTING STARR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is the text of the order by a three-judge U.S. Court of Appeals panel 
naming Kenneth W. Starr as an independent counsel to take over the Whitewater 
investigation: 
</P>
<P>
 Upon consideration of the application of the attorney general pursuant to 28 
U.S.C. Section 592 (c)(1)(A) for the appointment of an independent counsel with 
authority to exercise all the power, authority and obligations set forth in 28 
U.S.C. Section 594, to investigate whether any individuals or entities have 
committed a violation of federal criminal law, other than a Class B or C 
misdemeanor or infraction, relating in any way to James B. McDougal's, 
President William Jefferson Clinton's, or Mrs. Hillary Rodham Clinton's 
relationships with Madison Guaranty Savings and Loan Assn., Whitewater 
Development Corp., or Capital Management Services Inc.; it is: 
</P>
<P>
 ORDERED by the court in accordance with the authority vested in it by 28 
U.S.C. Section 593 (b) that Kenneth W. Starr, Esquire, of the District of 
Columbia bar, with offices at Kirkland and Ellis, 655-15th St., NW, Washington, 
D.C., 20005, be and he is hereby appointed independent counsel with full power, 
independent authority, and jurisdiction to investigate to the maximum extent 
authorized by the Independent Counsel Reauthorization Act of 1994 whether any 
individuals or entities have committed a violation of any federal criminal law, 
other than a Class B or C misdemeanor or infraction, relating in any way to 
James B. McDougal's, President William Jefferson Clinton's, or Mrs. Hillary 
Rodham Clinton's relationships with Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan Assn., 
Whitewater Development Corp., or Capital Management Services Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 The independent counsel shall have jurisdiction and authority to investigate 
other allegations or evidence or violation of any federal criminal law, other 
than a Class B or C misdemeanor or infraction, by any person or entity 
developed during the independent counsel's investigation referred to above and 
connected with or arising out of that investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The independent counsel shall have jurisdiction and authority to investigate 
any violation of 28 U.S.C. Section 1826, or any obstruction of the due 
administration of justice, or any material false testimony or statement in 
violation of federal criminal law, in connection with any investigation of the 
matters described above. 
</P>
<P>
 The independent counsel shall have jurisdiction and authority to seek 
indictments and to prosecute any persons or entities involved in any of the 
matters described above, who are reasonably believed to have committed a 
violation of any federal criminal law arising out of such matters, including 
persons or entities who have engaged in an unlawful conspiracy or who have 
aided or abetted any federal offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The independent counsel shall have all the powers and authority provided by 
the Independent Counsel Reauthorization Act of 1994. It is: 
</P>
<P>
 Further ordered by the court that the independent counsel, as authorized by 28 
U.S.C. Section 594, shall have prosecutorial jurisdiction to fully investigate 
and prosecute the subject matter with respect to which the attorney general 
requested the appointment of independent counsel, as hereinbefore set forth, 
and all matters and individuals whose acts may be related to that subject 
matter, inclusive of authority to investigate and prosecute federal crimes 
(other than those classified as Class B or C misdemeanors or infractions) that 
may arise out of the above described matter, including perjury, obstruction of 
justice, destruction of evidence, and intimidation of witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The court, having reviewed the motion of the attorney general that Robert B. 
Fiske Jr., would be appointed as independent counsel, had determined that this 
would not be consistent with the purposes of the act. 
</P>
<P>
 This reflects no conclusion on the part of the court that Fiske lacks either 
the accrual independence or any other attribute necessary to the conclusion of 
the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, the court reaches this conclusion because the act contemplates an 
apparent as well as an actual independence on the part of the counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Senate report accompanying the 1982 enactments reflected, "The intent 
of the special prosecutor provisions is not to impugn the integrity of the 
attorney general or the Department of Justice. Throughout our system of 
justice, safeguards exist against actual or perceived conflicts of interest 
without reflecting adversely on the parties who are subject to conflicts." 
</P>
<P>
 Just so here. It is not our intent to impugn the integrity of the attorney 
general's appointee, but rather to reflect the intent of the act that the actor 
be protected against perceptions of conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 As Fiske was appointed by the incumbent Administration, the court therefore 
deems it in the best interest of the appearance of independence contemplated by 
the act that a person not affiliated with the incumbent Administration be 
appointed. 
</P>
<P>
 It further appearing to the court in light of the attorney general's motion 
heretofore made for the authorization of the disclosure of her application for 
this appointment pursuant to 28 U.S.C. Section 592 (e) and of the ongoing 
public proceedings and interest in this matter, that it is in the best 
interests of justice for the identity and prosecutorial jurisdiction of the 
independent counsel to be disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 It is so ordered.

SENATE OKS SEPARATE SOCIAL SECURITY AGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate on Friday approved legislation that would make the Social Security 
Administration an independent agency, taking it out of the Department of Health 
and Human Services. 
</P>
<P>
 The separation would take effect on March 31, 1995, creating a new agency, 
among the largest in the federal government with a budget of $325 billion, 
65,000 employees and 1,300 field offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill was approved on a voice vote and sent to the House, which is expected 
to add its endorsement and send the measure to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters say making Social Security an independent agency will help restore 
public confidence in the government's largest domestic program. They say the 
agency will become more visible, less vulnerable to budget cuts, and better 
insulated from partisan politics.

HANTAVIRUS CASE CONFIRMED IN LAS VEGAS WORKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clark County's first hantavirus victim, a Las Vegas construction worker who 
recovered from the deadly disease, has been confirmed by the state Health 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Randy Todd, state epidemiologist, also said Friday that Washoe County 
health officials are investigating a possible hantavirus case involving a 
Vya-area woman, who also survived. 
</P>
<P>
 Todd said tests confirmed that the Las Vegas man was infected with the Muerto 
Canyon virus, which caused the hantavirus. He could have been exposed outside 
the county, possibly while working on building projects, Todd said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The investigation is continuing, so we don't know yet whether his job was a 
factor," Todd said. "It's something we're considering in our investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada has one reported hantavirus death, a Sparks man who died suddenly in 
October. Two other Nevadans also got the virus but survived.

RESIDENTS TOLD TO FLEE FROM SIERRA FIRE; FORESTS: MOST OPT TO STAY. BLAZE 
STARTED BY SPARK FROM MACHINERY. MORE THAN 4,800 ACRES AROUND CALIFORNIA/NEVADA 
BORDER ARE CONSUMED.

 Towering pines weakened by years of drought erupted in a firestorm that raged 
through more than 4,800 acres and burned at least three homes near this 
settlement west of Reno, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured, and despite heavy smoke visible for dozens of miles, 
Interstate 80 remained open and busy with travelers crossing the Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never seen anything like it. You could see the place exploding," said 
Verdi volunteer firefighter Pete Hegge. "It just came down the canyon, then all 
hell broke loose." 
</P>
<P>
 The Crystal Peak fire was reported just before 2 p.m. Thursday and raced 
through about 1,000 acres on the California side of the state line before it 
was three hours old. It began in Tahoe National Forest and spread into Toiyabe 
National Forest, sweeping downhill into Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents were advised to evacuate as the fire hovered near several 
subdivisions Friday, but most opted to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're watching the flames from our back-yard patio," said Cindy Ballman, who 
vowed to "stay put as long as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials let only residents enter Verdi, a community of 1,200 just east of 
the California line, and chased away gawkers who lined the road into town to 
view the flames. 
</P>
<P>
 At the height of the fire Thursday, flames shot 100 feet into the sky and ash 
fell in Reno, 12 miles to the east. By Friday, calmer winds and higher humidity 
had set in, helping the 1,000 firefighters on the scene. At dusk, the fire was 
25% contained. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the blaze was apparently sparked by a piece of machinery 
operating in an area left tinder dry after eight years of drought.

CHARLES CHAPPELL; VETERAN L.A. JOURNALIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charles R. (Chuck) Chappell, one of the last of that colorful breed of city 
editor from an era when five daily newspapers competed for space on the porches 
and in the newsstands of Los Angeles, has died. 
</P>
<P>
 The veteran journalist had more recently been West Coast public relations 
director of Douglas Aircraft Co. (later McDonnell Douglas) after his tenure at 
the Los Angeles Daily News ended with the paper's demise in 1954. He retired 
from Douglas in 1977 and was 81 when he died. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Duncan, who had been co-editor with Chappell of their high school 
newspaper in Huntington Park, said his old friend had died of congestive heart 
failure at Saddleback Community Hospital in Laguna Hills on Wednesday 
</P>
<P>
 Chappell came to the Daily News after serving on Gen. Douglas MacArthur's 
staff in the Pacific during World War II. He had previously worked for the 
Bakersfield Californian after graduating from Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
 A proper, reserved, sometimes distant gentleman, he was an odd hire at the 
Daily News, which had a reputation as the most liberal, pro-union 
leftist-leaning of the metropolitan newspapers of wartime and postwar Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The city editors who ran the old Daily News, Examiner, Mirror, Herald Express 
and Los Angeles Times were an imaginative bunch who treated the competition 
with disdain and provided their readers with equal doses of information, 
cynicism and mirth. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralph Richardson at the Examiner and Agness Underwood at the Herald fought 
bitterly for news breaks on the Black Dahlia murder or Errol Flynn's and 
Charlie Chaplin's paternity suits and other sensational stories of the day.

 William F. Thomas at the Mirror established an international "hot line" in 
which personalities ranging from Popes to notable paupers to princes would be 
interviewed by phone each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry (Hank) Osborne at The Times ran the most sedate of the five city rooms, 
dealing generally with the significant political and economic developments of 
the time, but he was also known for producing yarns about political intrigue 
(usually involving Democrats) and for chasing an occasional police siren. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Thomas, who came to The Times in 1962 when the Mirror was closed and 
retired as the paper's editor in 1989, is still alive.

<P>
 Chappell's wartime service was at odds with his profession. He served as 
MacArthur's press censor, deleting news items that could have been of value to 
the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 And he remained in character on his return, refusing in a 1944 interview to 
answer any questions about his military duties. 
</P>
<P>
 Chappell leaves no survivors. 
</P>
<P>
 Services are pending.

BOY, 12, ARRESTED IN OXNARD DRUG INVESTIGATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 To the undercover officer, the drug dealer seemed a savvy veteran of the 
trade. Eyeing new customers with suspicion, he spoke the users' lingo and 
offered his wares 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was well-schooled, very streetwise," said Oxnard narcotics Detective Bob 
Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 He was also 12 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 The thin, dark-haired boy was arrested late Thursday, along with his 
25-year-old brother and his brother's girlfriend, after police raided the 
family's home in a crime-ridden south Oxnard neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the three-bedroom apartment, detectives seized one ounce of cocaine, 
about five grams of heroin and $260 cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say the boy, who is now in foster care, was put to work selling cocaine 
by his older brother. And, they say, he was sometimes left to care for five 
younger children. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they were doing was sacrificing the life and soul of a 12-year-old for 
their personal financial gain," Police Sgt. Mike Matlock said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He should be worrying about baseballs and girls and stuff 12-year-olds think 
about, not whether some junkie's going to jump him and take the drugs or how he 
can hide the drugs from police." 
</P>
<P>
 The four-unit apartment building at 5200 Charles St. has been owned by Oxnard 
City Councilman Bedford Pinkard since 1979, according to property records. 
Pinkard could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say it is extremely uncommon for an adolescent to actually conduct drug 
sales in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have seen parents use children to hold drugs or, say, walk out and hand a 
package to somebody," Camarillo said. "But this kid knew a lot about the 
business and how to conduct business." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard's only other comparable case, he said, involved a 14-year-old boy 
arrested several months ago for selling small amounts of rock cocaine on a 
street corner in La Colonia. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, the boys also were users of the drug. The 14-year-old was 
heavily addicted to rock cocaine, and the 12-year-old admitted to trying it 
once, Camarillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-year-old's brother, Roberto Guadalupe Avitia, and Avitia's 21-year-old 
girlfriend, Maria Raquel Chavez, were booked into County Jail on suspicion of 
possessing cocaine for sale, using a minor to sell cocaine and willful cruelty 
to a child. 
</P>
<P>
 They were being held in lieu of $10,000 bail each and are scheduled to be 
arraigned in Ventura County Municipal Court on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy was cited, police said, and a juvenile probation officer will 
recommend how his case should be handled. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Terence M. Kilbride said that if convicted, the couple 
could face up to nine years in state prison for using the 12-year-old to sell 
drugs, and up to five years in prison for selling cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is probably a very common charge down in L.A. where gang members 
typically use younger kids in a gang (to sell drugs)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Kilbride said, the state law creating stiffer penalties for using a 
minor to sell drugs was passed as a result of activity by Los Angeles street 
gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted to make sure those people inducing the younger members into doing 
it got a pretty healthy sentence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police began their investigation of the apartment about two weeks ago when 
they got a tip about a child peddling drugs at the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Working undercover, Camarillo said he twice went to the apartment, where the 
12-year-old answered the door and sold him small amounts of cocaine for $40 and 
$20. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy was turned over to Child Protective Services, along with his 
10-year-old sister and 6-year-old brother. 
</P>
<P>
 The three children of Avitia and Chavez -- a 4-year-old, a 2-year-old and a 
7-month-old baby -- were also placed in foster care pending the outcome of the 
criminal case and a custody hearing, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 During an interview with police, the young boy was shy but cooperative, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy, who is due to enter eighth grade at Charles Blackstock Junior High in 
the fall, told police he was selling the cocaine because "his brother 
threatened him and made him do it," Camarillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-year-old's mother also lives in the apartment, but was at church during 
the drug raid and was not arrested, Camarillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, several women and a young man were cleaning out the Charles Street 
apartment, piling furniture and clothing in a pickup truck parked out front. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just helping them out," said the man, who declined to give his name. 
</P>
<P>
 The apartment is in the Southwinds neighborhood -- an area where police have 
for years fought a pitched battle against drugs, gangs and blight. 
</P>
<P>
 Many alleys are strewn with trash and junk cars and marked with graffiti. The 
area has a high concentration of apartment buildings, many of which are 
fortified with wrought-iron window bars. 
</P>
<P>
 A 16-year-old boy, who has lived near the scene of Thursday's raid for about 
six years, said he has been jolted awake at night by the sound of gunshots 
behind his home. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why my mother said next summer we're getting out of here, going back 
East," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth said Avitia and his family had lived in the apartment only for a few 
months. Because of heavy foot traffic to the door, the boy said he suspected 
drugs were being sold. 
</P>
<P>
 'Before, it used to be just like gangs (selling drugs)," said the 16-year-old. 
"Now it's just regular people you wouldn't think of."

FEINSTEIN OFFERS PLAN TO COUNTER BASE CLOSURES; MILITARY: SENATOR URGES 
CONSOLIDATING THE RESEARCH AND TESTING OPERATIONS OF EIGHT WESTERN FACILITIES, 
INCLUDING POINT MUGU. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trying to protect the Point Mugu Navy base from possible closure, Sen. Dianne 
Feinstein on Friday proposed that the base be joined with seven other military 
weapons-testing sites under one federal command. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's safety-in-numbers approach asks U.S. Secretary of Defense William 
Perry to consider placing eight Western military bases under one central 
research and testing command. 
</P>
<P>
 "This proposal would help prevent future base closures in California and 
expand operations at the southwest bases, thus creating new jobs," Feinstein 
said in a written statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "In addition, this proposal would reduce costs to the taxpayer and make our 
military more efficient." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, the southwestern command would oversee Point Mugu, its 
sister Navy base at China Lake, Edwards Air Force Base, Fort Irwin, the 
Twenty-nine Palms Marine Corps Base, the Yuma, Ariz., Proving Ground; the Utah 
Test and Training Range; and the Dugway, Utah, Proving Ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan would also centralize military research conducted at Vandenberg Air 
Force Base, Chocolate Mountain Gunnery Range and the Electronic Proving Ground 
at Fort Huachuca. 
</P>
<P>
 By consolidating the research facilities, all of the bases would be spared 
closure, thereby preventing economic ruin to the communities in which they are 
located, Feinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have estimated that the Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station 
contributes about $1 billion a year to Ventura County's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The letter, which was signed by Feinstein's Democratic colleague, Sen. Barbara 
Boxer, and three other Western senators, notes that such a move might initially 
be viewed with suspicion by the different branches of the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
 As proposed, the Southwest Air Systems Research, Development, Testing and 
Evaluation Complex would strip independent control of testing and evaluation 
from the Army, Air Force, Navy and Marine Corps and place it under a single 
federal command. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are sensitive to the fact that each of these facilities is presently being 
managed by their respective services as independent activities performing their 
own service-specific work," Feinstein wrote.  
</P>
<P>
 But she said the notion of creating an inter-service command was generated by 
a similar proposal offered by the Navy and the Air Force in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Point Mugu spokesman Alan Alpers said he believed the Navy might show some 
support for the initiative, given concern about the upcoming round of base 
closures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it certainly has interesting possibilities," Alpers said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It certainly drives forward the issue of joint-servicing and is in keeping 
with the overall goals of the move to downsize and make more efficient the 
armed services." 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed out that the Navy and Air Force are working together on the 
development of an Air Force missile at Point Mugu.

CITYSCAPES / EDWARD J. BOYER: "DESIGN IS A FEELING -- SOMETHING RIGHT IN MY 
FINGERTIPS THAT HAS TO BE RELEASED."; TIME FINALLY CATCHES UP WITH DESIGNER'S 
CAR OF THE FUTURE 
</P>

<P>
 It can be difficult to get Cliff Hall to sit still for more than a few minutes 
at a time when his fertile imagination is throwing off ideas. He grabs any 
piece of paper within reach -- a napkin, the back of a photo, margins of 
newspapers -- and begins sketching a proposed answer to his many questions that 
begin: "What if. . . ?" 
</P>
<P>
 His "what ifs" have led, among other things, to a compact set of furniture -- 
table, sound system, closet and bed -- that all folds into a cabinet measuring 
6 by 4 by 2 feet, a mobile film processing lab and an on-board system to alert 
drivers of approaching emergency vehicles -- a safety device intended for 
motorists who are hard of hearing or simply love loud music. 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, Hall has never found the financing to bring any of those products to 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 His most challenging "what if" came back in 1965, when he arrived at the 
perfectly sensible conclusion that one effective way to improve economic and 
social conditions in black communities would be to develop some industries. 
</P>
<P>
 He decided to build a car. 
</P>
<P>
 And what a car he built: With a $100,000 stake from the late Beverly Hills 
businessman Louis Corwin, Hall built a prototype -- a stunning two-seater with 
a fiberglass body still regarded as 20 years ahead of its time. When the car, 
named the Corwin, was completed in 1969, its projected price was about $4,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall said Corwin, an importer of Panasonic electronics products, told him: "I 
had no idea your car would be this sophisticated. I guess you're on your way." 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him," Hall said, "I was going to be the Martin Luther King Jr. of 
industry." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All angles and elbows, Hall, who will be 69 on Thursday, has a rail-thin, 
Ichabod Crane physique and enough energy to leave people half his age panting 
trying to keep up with him. He is the world's greatest endorsement for junk 
food. His mornings typically begin with coffee and jelly doughnuts. He has 
never met a greasy hamburger he didn't like, and he is a connoisseur of 
carryout from fast-food joints in his Mid-Wilshire neighborhood. Eating is just 
an inconvenient interruption of his planning, sketching, designing. 
</P>
<P>
 "What motivates me more than anything else is that I like to create," he said. 
"I like to take raw material and turn it into something of value. Design is a 
feeling -- something right in my fingertips that has to be released." 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles native, Hall was chief photographer for the Los Angeles 
Sentinel, the African American weekly newspaper, for 27 years. He nurtured 
young talent such as Howard Bingham, who went on to shoot for Life magazine and 
became Muhammad Ali's official photographer. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall was also a much-in-demand society photographer in Beverly Hills and 
Bel-Air for nearly a decade, beginning in the 1950s, and ran a photo studio on 
Western Avenue and 48th Street that has passed into South-Central Los Angeles 
legend. One photographer there was Lamont McLemore, one of five singers who 
formed the 5th Dimension in Hall's studio. 
</P>
<P>
 None of Hall's friends doubted that he could build a car. After all, they had 
seen him build a sophisticated miniature electric car in the late 1950s for his 
grade-school-age son, a car the boy drove into a neighborhood drive-in 
restaurant where a car hop served him a hamburger. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall comes from a long line of tinkerers. "My grandfather was a watchmaker and 
my grandmother's two brothers built race cars and an airplane for themselves 
back in the 1920s." 
</P>
<P>
 When Hall completed the Corwin, he began scouring the black community for 
financing to build production molds. For the last 25 years, Hall said, he has 
"gone to politicians and supposedly black investment people and . . gotten 
little or no help -- not even encouragement." His voice trailed off in 
frustration. "For them not to see the value. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall said even his friends were pessimistic, telling him: "The Man ain't gonna 
let no brother build no cars." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall's answer: "The Man gave me the money to build the prototype because he 
thought it was admirable that I wanted to do something on this magnitude in our 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Corwin languished in storage until Los Angeles County's new Petersen 
Automotive Museum on Wilshire Boulevard and Fairfax Avenue got wind of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "This car did predate the Pontiac Fiero and the Fiat X 1/9, two small, popular 
mid-engine cars (with engines between the axles) that gained international 
reputations," said Leslie Kendall, the manager of the museum's automobile 
collection. "Visitors like its compactness, plus they think it's an attractive 
car." 
</P>
<P>
 If the times are catching up to Hall's idea, he and his partner, designer 
Dennis Huguley are ready with another project. They have come up with a 
bullet-shaped, enclosed, two-passenger, three-wheel motorcycle that can be 
powered electrically or with gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 "The passenger compartment will have the feel of a motorcycle, but it will 
have the safety of two rear wheels to give it stability," Hall said. "It will 
have air conditioning, a heater, a CD player, a radio and a removable canopy." 
</P>
<P>
 Again, none of Hall's friends doubt that he and Huguley can build their "Magic 
Machine," as they call it. But Hall is finding that raising capital to build a 
prototype is every bit as tough in 1994 as it was in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Reynolds, a photographer at the Petersen Museum, was admiring Hall's car 
recently, recalling how he had seen the Corwin at the 1970 Los Angeles Auto 
Show. 
</P>
<P>
 "This car should have been built," Reynolds said. "He worked damned hard on 
it. The problem was that it probably wasn't the 'in' thing to do at the time. 
Now it would probably happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall is hoping that it will happen with the Magic Machine.

OPPOSITION MAY STYMIE PLAN TO CUT INTERCHANGE TRAFFIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CONSTANCE SOMMER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan to cut traffic at Ventura's crowded Seaward Avenue interchange may be 
scaled back significantly because of intense opposition from local homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 A City Council committee recommended Friday scuttling plans for a new on-ramp 
near the Seaward Avenue and Ventura Freeway intersection, a key component in a 
city and Caltrans plan to improve traffic flow at the city's 
second-most-crowded intersection. The committee -- composed of Councilmen Jim 
Monahan and Jack Tingstrom and Mayor Tom Buford -- agreed with angry Ventura 
Keys residents, who argued that a Peninsula Street on-ramp would crowd their 
streets with unwanted cars and lower their property values. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee's recommendation is expected to be considered by the full 
council in September. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Keys residents said they were delighted with the committee's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy to hear what I hear this morning," said Suzy Clark, who lives 
on Peninsula Street. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jim Gonzalez, owner of the At The Beach bikini shop on Seaward and a Keys 
resident, said he favors the Peninsula on-ramp because it would help break the 
traffic bottleneck at Seaward, which is a principal route to Ventura State 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime you divide (traffic) up, it will make it freer," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Seaward project without the Peninsula on-ramp would cost the California 
Department of Transportation $6.5 million to $8 million, and construction would 
not begin until at least 1997, city traffic engineer Nazir Lalani said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, construction could start as late as 1999 because Caltrans is so 
overwhelmed with seismic retrofitting projects statewide, Lalani said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since news of the redesign became known in May, the well-organized 
Ventura Keys homeowners have lobbied the council and testified against the 
Peninsula on-ramp at hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of the posh canal homes say the on-ramp would increase traffic on 
Peninsula Street, which cuts through the Keys, and erode area home values. 
</P>
<P>
 City engineers report that the on-ramp would increase traffic on Peninsula by 
800 trips a day, from 4,800 to 5,600. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council already considered the project last month, but postponed 
voting on it so the council's traffic committee could further examine the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 City engineers earlier recommended adding the Peninsula on-ramp, because it 
would cut traffic at the intersection of Seaward Avenue and Harbor Boulevard by 
350 cars an hour in peak hours. Peninsula Street is about one-quarter mile 
southeast of Seaward. 
</P>
<P>
 But Caltrans officials said the Peninsula on-ramp may create political 
problems greater than the traffic problems it will solve. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Peninsula option has the potential of delaying the project" because 
homeowner opposition and environmental reviews may bog it down for years, said 
Douglas R. Failing, Caltrans' deputy district director.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead of the new on-ramp, city engineers have proposed new turn lanes in 15 
to 20 years to handle increased traffic. But even two extra turn lanes will be 
only about half as effective as the Peninsula Street on-ramp, Lalani said. 
</P>
<P>
 One right-turn lane would cut into a vacant lot on Harbor Boulevard north of 
Seaward Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
 But the other lane would snatch a strip of property from the Chevron gas 
station, where it fronts Seaward west of Harbor Boulevard.  
</P>
<P>
 Chevron officials could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan approved by the committee would: 
</P>
<P>
 * Retrofit and widen the bridge over the freeway from five to eight lanes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Widen the northbound off-ramp on Seaward to include an extra right-turn lane 
and left-turn lane. 
</P>
<P>
 * Add an extra left-turn lane on southbound Harbor Boulevard at Seaward. 
</P>
<P>
 * Add another through lane and another right-turn lane on northbound Harbor 
Boulevard at Seaward.

OXNARD MULLS PLAN TO ANNEX HARBOR WATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oxnard has long been aggressive in annexing surrounding land. Now it wants a 
piece of the water as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council is set to consider Tuesday a plan to annex the water 
area of Channel Islands Harbor -- an unincorporated part of the county -- to 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard officials say their plan is intended to reduce confusion between the 
city and county over who should provide fire, police and other services at the 
county-owned and operated harbor. Oxnard provides services on the land, while 
the county provides services to the boats in the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city has primarily done all the (police and fire) response down there 
anyway," said Richard J. Maggio, city community development director. "We have 
a fire station down there right near the water." 
</P>
<P>
 City leaders also argue that it is unnatural for the harbor to be a part of 
the county, since it is surrounded by the city of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 But some county officials are charging that money is Oxnard's true motive, 
since the county receives about $500,000 in property taxes from docks and boats 
in the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not terribly aware about confusion with police and fire in the water," 
said Frank Anderson, Channel Islands Harbor manager for 25 years. "There is a 
specific agreement which has been in place since 1963. (Money) would be the 
only reason." 
</P>
<P>
 County Supervisor John Flynn, whose district includes the harbor, said Oxnard 
officials should have contacted him about their plan. And he threatened to try 
to take back the land surrounding the harbor from the city as a countermeasure. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they start this process, we'll turn around and take the whole harbor 
back," Flynn said. "If they're going to do this, it's going to happen over my 
dead body."  
</P>
<P>
 Channel Islands Harbor covers more than 300 acres of land and water. The 
county spent $1 million to dig the harbor and has borrowed another $7 million 
to pay for improvements since it opened in 1965. It leases most of the 
surrounding land to developers, who have built restaurants, condominiums and 
about 3,600 boat slips. 
</P>
<P>
 The county makes about $2 million annually from leases and taxes at the 
harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 But the water area of the harbor is included in Oxnard's sphere of influence 
as approved by the Ventura County Local Agency Formation Commission, a state 
agency that deals with jurisdictional matters, Maggio said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The annexation would have to be approved by LAFCO, Maggio said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically this is an item with LAFCO," he said. "It wouldn't be something 
that the county would have any say in." 
</P>
<P>
 But Flynn, who is one of five members of LAFCO and its chairman, said Oxnard 
does not have the votes to execute a power play. A second county supervisor, 
Maria VanderKolk, is also on the commission. So are city council members from 
Thousand Oaks and Ventura and a fifth member who holds no elected office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes three votes to do what they want to do," Flynn said, "and I don't 
think they're there." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Oxnard City Council decides to move forward on Tuesday, LAFCO will 
schedule a hearing on the matter. After a commission vote, the proposal would 
return to the City Council for a final decision, Maggio said. The entire 
procedure would take only three or four months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn said Oxnard leaders should be grateful for the money the harbor has 
brought into the city. He added that the city has not done much to fulfill its 
responsibilities around the waterway.  
</P>
<P>
 "The city takes in about $500,00 to $600,000 in bed and board taxes from the 
harbor without putting that much into it," Flynn said. "We had to take over the 
landscaping because they did such a sloppy job. The harbor was looking 
terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 When the harbor was annexed to the city in 1963, the water portion was left 
out due to concerns about city property taxes being levied on boats. The city 
and the county both thought it would have made the harbor less competitive with 
other small-boat marinas in Southern California, especially Marina Del Rey, 
Maggio said.  
</P>
<P>
 But under Proposition 13 passed in 1978, there is no difference in tax rates 
between the city and an unincorporated area, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard council members Tom Holden and Bedford Pinkard would not comment 
Friday, saying they had not reviewed the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Manuel Lopez said that while Oxnard has talked about annexing the water 
before, he was surprised that the issue is set for council discussion on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are annexing or de-annexing, it seems to me that we should have had 
some discussion with the other party, in this instance the county and John 
Flynn," Lopez said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; FESTIVAL FINDS OTHELLO LEAD IN ALABAMA 
</P>

<P>
 Staging a Shakespeare play is always a challenge for any production company. 
</P>
<P>
 But the organizers of the Ojai Shakespeare Festival faced an especially tough 
challenge with its latest production of "Othello." 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is simple," the director of the play, which kicked off Friday 
night at the Libbey Bowl, stated in a recent news release. "Where in Ventura 
County do we find a black actor?" 
</P>
<P>
 Geoff Foley, manager of the Shakespeare Festival, said finding black actors in 
the Ojai area to play the lead role was next to impossible. The city had 27 
black residents, according to the 1990 census. Blacks only make up 2.2% of the 
county's population. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you just look at the demographics and numbers, they're not on our side," 
Foley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Foley said Director Paul Backer auditioned six black actors for the Othello 
role, two of them near his home in Santa Monica. No black actors showed up when 
Backer staged auditions in Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 But festival organizers finally found their man in Shriff Hasan, 41. 
</P>
<P>
 Backer, who was Hasan's voice and speech instructor at L.A. City College's 
theatre academy several years ago, contacted Hasan last spring about the role 
of Othello. A 20-year veteran of the stage, Hasan was teaching theatre at the 
Tuskegee Institute in Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 Hasan agreed to do the part, saying that Backer had directed him previously in 
a different production. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knew my capabilities as an actor," Hasan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Othello" opened Friday evening and will stage a show each night this weekend. 
Three more shows are scheduled next weekend. Admission is $12 and $15, with 
reduced prices for seniors and teen-agers. JASON GRANT

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; CITY'S 1ST REGGAE JAM TO FEATURE 14 BANDS

<P>
 A lineup of 14 different reggae bands is scheduled to appear this weekend at 
Oxnard's first Reggae Jam on the Coast at College Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Popular acts including the San Diego-based band Big Mountain, the Jamaican 
ensemble Toots and the Maytals, and Nigerian guitarist King Sunny Ade are 
scheduled to perform. 
</P>
<P>
 Concert producer Michael Levine said he picked the Oxnard site after attending 
this year's Strawberry Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw their success, and how beautiful the venue is and thought it might 
work," said Levine, who works with the San Francisco-based music promoter 
Events West. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers are modeling the Oxnard reggae festival on the decade-old annual 
concert called Reggae on the River in Humboldt County. Levine expects from 
3,000 to 5,000 people to attend and said he hopes that the concert will become 
an annual event in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The festivities are set to begin at 11 a.m. Saturday with a performance by 
Azumah, a South African dance and marimba group, and will go until about 8 
p.m., finishing with performances by Big Mountain and Toots and the Maytals. 
</P>
<P>
 The show will resume again Sunday at 11 a.m. with local ska band the Lion I's 
and finish around 7 p.m. with King Sunny Ade and Inner Circle, a Jamaican band. 
Tickets are available for $22.50 at College Park, 3250 S. Rose Ave., Oxnard.

<P>
 The Greater Ventura Chamber of Commerce wants to help train future community 
leaders by sponsoring a special class designed to help those interested in 
public service to improve their communication and problem-solving skills. 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber will hold a breakfast on Thursday to preview the monthly class, 
entitled "Touch of Leadership Ventura." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Barroca, executive vice president of the chamber, said similar classes 
have been run by chambers in other cities throughout the country and have 
proven successful. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the Ventura class will offer 10 sessions for a charge of $700. The 
class starts Sept. 13 and ends June 10, 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is aimed at trying to develop upcoming community leaders," Barroca said. 
"We want to give them a knowledge of all aspects of the city and county -- the 
education system, the political system, the government system." 
</P>
<P>
 The preview breakfast will provide a chance to find out more by talking with 
graduates of the program from other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The 8 a.m. event costs $5 per person and will be held at the Wedgewood Banquet 
Center on Olivas Park Drive in Ventura. For a class application, call the 
chamber at 648-2875. JASON GRANT

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: DEADLINE FOR QUAKE RELIEF IS EXTENDED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Disaster aid officials announced they have extended the deadline to apply for 
earthquake relief to Oct. 17. The previous deadline was Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Victims of the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake will have until Oct. 17 to apply 
for federal disaster aid, according to a statement issued Friday by the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency and the Governor's Office of Emergency Services. 
</P>
<P>
 The Small Business Administration also pushed back the deadline to Oct. 17 for 
home and business owners to apply for disaster recovery loans, the statement 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite the extension, individuals should not procrastinate," the statement 
warned. "They should apply as soon as possible. The sooner they apply, the 
sooner they will receive assistance if they are found eligible." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the earthquake, nearly 608,000 people have applied for assistance. FEMA 
has paid out nearly $1 billion for emergency repairs, disaster housing and 
rental and mortgage assistance. The SBA has approved $3 billion in disaster 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the state Individual Family Grant Program has paid more than $100 
million in grants for needs not met by insurance or other aid, the statement 
said. MACK REED

 A 45-year-old porn actress from Newbury Park charged with seducing a 
14-year-old boy pleaded not guilty Friday in Ventura County Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary hearing for Laurie Arden, charged with six felony counts of 
child molestation, was set for Aug. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Arden faces two counts of unlawful sexual intercourse with a minor, two counts 
of sexual conduct using a foreign object, one count of showing explicit photos 
to a minor and one count of lewd and lascivious conduct with a minor. 
</P>
<P>
 She was arrested at the E-Z 8 Motel in Newbury Park on July 27 after the 
alleged victim told police he had sex with her twice in April and May after she 
hired him to help her move out of a rented room on White Oak Lane. She 
allegedly showed the boy nude images of herself on a computer screen and in a 
magazine, then suggested they have sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Arden is unemployed, but apparently posed for sexually explicit films and 
magazines as recently as several months ago, police said. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY EDITION: MOORPARK; COUNCIL DELAYS VOTE ON HOUSING PROJECT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Moorpark City Council has delayed a vote on a proposed 552-house project 
in the city's southeast section until a legal dispute with the developer can be 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 The council put off until its first meeting in September a decision on a 
proposal by Carlsberg Financial Corp. to build the upscale homes on 500 acres 
at Tierra Rejada Road and the Moorpark Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Monica-based developer has tried for six years to build the project, 
suing the city in 1991 over the number of homes that would be allowed. 
Negotiations are under way to settle the lawsuit, which must happen before the 
project could be approved. 
</P>
<P>
 As drafted, a tentative settlement would exempt the Carlsberg project from any 
future growth-control laws, although the company would have to abide by an 
existing growth-control ordinance called Measure F. Under the draft agreement, 
the council would approve Carlsberg's project in exchange for the builder 
dropping its lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will discuss the settlement agreement at a special meeting at 
7 p.m. Wednesday at Moorpark City Hall. SCOTT HADLY

<P>
 Walking and talking his way through Moorpark's Gateway Plaza late Friday 
morning, Assemblyman Nao Takasugi heard from local shop owners and their 
employees about business. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second "business walk" the Oxnard Republican has had this week.On 
Wednesday, Takasugi stopped by a few Camarillo shops to talk with merchants. 
The walks are meant to keep him in touch with the concerns of local business 
owners.  
</P>
<P>
 "They raised a lot of local concerns in Camarillo," Takasugi said. "In 
Moorpark, I'm hearing about more statewide issues like workers' comp." 
</P>
<P>
 The assemblyman visited about half a dozen businesses, including a real estate 
office, video store, cleaning company and pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Sumner, who operates a maid service that employs about 40 people, said one 
of the first questions his employees asked was why Takasugi was so focused on 
the concerns of local business owners.  
</P>
<P>
 Takasugi said keeping business profitable keeps people employed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just great that he was here to answer those types of questions," 
Sumner said, adding that he wants the state to continue to reform workers' 
compensation laws to remove fraud from the system.  
</P>
<P>
 "I told him my concerns and he took the time to explain to me what they were 
doing in Sacramento to reform the system," he said. Sumner added that in the 
last year the most recent reforms have saved him about 25% in his workers' 
compensation bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Takasugi also heard about issues not related to business, such as immigration 
and crime, as well as concerns about traffic on California 118 through town.

 A rodent, presumed to be a rat, caused a two-hour power outage in Thousand 
Oaks early Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 A Southern California Edison spokeswoman said the rodent was probably 
exploring a transformer when it jammed the system and caused an overload, which 
shut down part of the power system. About 1,200 customers on Thousand Oaks 
Boulevard were without power from 1:44 until 3:33 a.m. MARY F. POLS

 A Simi Valley defense contractor has received an $11-million contract to 
fine-tune artillery detection equipment designed during the Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittaker Electronic Systems, which employs about 350 workers, will begin work 
on the contract immediately, company spokesman Jack Cannady said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the two-year contract, Whittaker will design three miniature versions of 
an electronic device called the Shortstop Electronic Detection System.  
</P>
<P>
 The device, which operates on radio frequencies, seeks out incoming artillery 
and detonates it midair before it reaches a target. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has no plans to hire additional workers to work on the project, 
Cannady said. SARA CATANIA

EMPLOYEE SAYS MARKET MANAGER SAVED HIS LIFE; OXNARD: WORKER SAYS SHOPLIFTING 
SUSPECT WAS SWINGING A KNIFE AT HIM WHEN HIS BOSS SHOT THE 16-YEAR-OLD.

<P>
 A 16-year-old suspected shoplifter shot in the back by an Oxnard store manager 
Thursday was lunging at a store employee with a knife when he was shot, the 
employee said Friday, adding that his manager "saved my life." 
</P>
<P>
 The youth, who has not been identified because of his age, remained at St. 
John's Regional Medical Center on Friday. At the request of his parents, no 
information was given on his condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they are still investigating the alleged theft and the shooting 
and have made no arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 The employee, who refused to give his name, said he was watching the boy about 
3:45 p.m. Thursday at Oxnard Ranch Market and saw him allegedly take three cans 
of styling mousse. The employee said he followed the youth out to the parking 
lot, where the boy got on a bicycle and tried to ride away, with a knife 
visible in his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The 21-year-old employee said he chased after the youth with other employees 
and yelled, "Are you gonna pay something?" 
</P>
<P>
 The employee said he tried to kick the youth's bicycle to stop him and missed, 
but the youth fell on his own as he crashed the bicycle into a car. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, he said, the youth swung the knife at him, and the manager, 
Ibrahim Himideh, who was coming out of the store, fired at the youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "He tried to cut my stomach and my manager shot him," the employee said. "He 
saved my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Police said one bullet was fired from a .25-caliber semiautomatic handgun.  
</P>
<P>
 The employee said he was not struck by the youth's knife, but his manager was 
later cut on the finger by the youth. Another witness said the manager and 
three employees handcuffed the youth, who was lying on the ground, unaware that 
he had been shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time the cops got there he was already cuffed," said a 23-year-old 
employee from Keene's Hardware & Home Improvements, located in the same 
shopping center as the market. "The knife was laying on the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the knife appeared to have about a 2 1/2-inch blade. 
</P>
<P>
 The hardware store employee said that the youth struggled and held his arms 
back trying not to be handcuffed. "He didn't even know he was shot," he said. 
"The manager said, 'Don't move, you've been shot.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The employee said the youth was shot in the middle of his lower back, adding 
that the manager pulled up the youth's shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 Himideh, 33, of Oxnard said in an interview Thursday evening that he was 
trying to protect his employees. He said he thought the youth may have had a 
gun, as well as the knife he saw. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the sudden, he reaches into his pants and pulls out what seems like a gun 
to one of my employees. So my employee started screaming, 'It's a gun, it's a 
gun,' " the manager said. "So I ran outside and see this guy basically flinging 
this knife left and right so he can get away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I seen this huge knife in his hand," he said, "and I was under the assumption 
that he had maybe a gun in his other hand. . . . Obviously, someone's life was 
at risk." 
</P>
<P>
 A Ventura County public defender said Friday that normally a store manager 
does not have the legal right to shoot a suspected shoplifter. But the attorney 
said that if a store manager or employee, or any other witness, believes deadly 
force is being used against a person, they can use deadly force to save the 
potential victim. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like the law of self-defense," Public Defender Duane Dammeyer 
said. "If someone uses deadly force against you, you would have the right to 
use deadly force to defend yourself. . . . Defense of others is similar. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it comes down to is the reasonableness of the store owner's belief," he 
said, adding that the specific circumstances of what a person sees and believes 
are scrutinized to see if the belief that deadly force is being used seems 
reasonable.

METROLINK PLANS 6 TRAINS TO TRANSPORT FAIR-GOERS; FESTIVAL: COMMUTER RAIL CARS 
WILL TAKE SPECIAL ROUTES. RIDERSHIP WILL HELP EXPERTS GAUGE INTEREST IN REGULAR 
WEEKEND SERVICE. 
</P>

<P>
 Residents planning to party at the Ventura County Fair later this month can 
bypass traffic and parking woes and cruise to the festival hassle-free by 
joining hundreds of other fair-goers on special fair-bound trains. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second year in a row, the Metrolink commuter trains that normally run 
between Oxnard and Downtown Los Angeles will change course to take residents to 
the fairgrounds in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're delighted to be able to bring people in and not congest the road and 
parking lots," fair spokeswoman Teri Raley said. "It's efficient, fast and fun, 
and everybody who rode it last year had a blast." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's service was so popular that Metrolink had to add extra trains to 
handle the heavy passenger loads. This year, Metrolink is upping the number of 
trains each day from four to six, including a late-night train for fair-goers 
who linger for the fireworks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The response last August was overwhelming," Metrolink spokesman Peter Hidalgo 
said. "We're expecting an even bigger turnout this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Service last summer cost about $39,000, attracted about 35,000 riders and 
turned a profit of more than $8,000. The profits were spent for Metrolink 
advertisements and promotions. 
</P>
<P>
 Raley said Metrolink helped boost fair attendance last summer, a trend she 
believes will continue. About 274,000 people attended the 1993 fair. 
</P>
<P>
 "Metrolink removes the hassle of driving and parking and makes the fair a more 
pleasant experience," she said. "This year even more people know about the 
train, so we're really expecting a big turnout." 
</P>
<P>
 The special Metrolink service may also help transportation experts gauge 
whether there is interest in running regular weekend trains, possibly to 
Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within the next year or so we're planning to look closely at the possibility 
of running regular weekend service," Hidalgo said. "This might give us an 
indication of the kind of a response we would get." 
</P>
<P>
 The Metrolink fair service will be offered on two weekends, Aug. 20-21 and 
Aug. 27-28, with stops in Simi Valley, Moorpark, Camarillo and Oxnard before 
reaching the fairgrounds in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The round-trip cost will be $6 per person from Simi Valley and Moorpark; $4 
from Camarillo and Oxnard. Children younger than 5 and passengers with 
Metrolink monthly passes can ride free. All stations are wheelchair-accessible. 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets can be purchased in advance at city halls in Simi Valley, Moorpark and 
Camarillo or by calling (800) 438-1112. 
</P>
<P>
 For fair-goers who are planning ahead, the Fair Board is offering a combined 
ticket good for both the train and the fair. These tickets range from $10 to 
$12 for adults and $7 to $9 for children, and must be purchased by Aug. 12. 
Call 648-3376 for more information. A mail-in coupon will be available in 
Sunday's Times.

FUGITIVE IN DRAG; SEEKING SUSPECTED PROBATION VIOLATOR, POLICE FIND THEIR MAN 
-- DRESSED AS A WOMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Hot on the trail of suspected probation violator Dave Marwick, Simi Valley 
police found only Karen. 
</P>
<P>
 She greeted the officers in eye makeup, a long white robe and a strangely 
high-pitched voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they noticed her hairy chest. 
</P>
<P>
 They had found their man. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Marwick is 5 feet, 9 inches tall and 170 pounds, so he's not a real 
shapely woman at that," said Sgt. Mike King, a department spokesman. "They 
asked him who he was, and he said in a woman's voice -- not a very Academy 
Award-winning voice -- Karen ." 
</P>
<P>
 Police busted Marwick, 27, on suspicion of breaking probation from a burglary 
conviction. No charges were expected against him for impersonating a woman to 
evade arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The pursuit of Marwick began, police said, just after 4 p.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers in the department's Special Enforcement Detail, out looking for him 
on a couple of warrants, spotted the pony-tailed, mustachioed suspect about to 
drive away from a mobile home in the city's east end. 
</P>
<P>
 One warrant, said Officer Craig Reiners, was for failing to appear in court to 
answer a charge of drug intoxication. The other warrant was issued after a 
Ventura County judge temporarily released Marwick from a burglary sentence to 
handle personal business after the Jan. 17 earthquake damaged his home, and he 
never came back, Reiners said. 
</P>
<P>
 "After I recognized him, I yelled, 'There he is,' and he saw our car," Reiners 
said. "I hit him with the red light, but he jumped out of his car and he had 
just enough of a lead on us to duck into a trailer. We weren't exactly sure 
where he had gone." 
</P>
<P>
 With 200 trailers in the park and no search warrants, the officers had to call 
off the chase after about 40 minutes, Reiners said. 
</P>
<P>
 An hour later, he said, a tipster told the officers they could find Marwick 
inside the trailer at space 190. But when they arrived it was locked, and no 
one answered the door, Reiners said. 
</P>
<P>
 A tipster called again at about 11 p.m. to say that Marwick was definitely 
inside the trailer, and the officers went and knocked. 
</P>
<P>
 Marwick's girlfriend answered and let the officers in to search the trailer, 
Reiners said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went in there and I observed him sitting with his back to me, and I saw he 
was dressed in a robe and his hair was down," said Sgt. John Wilcox, another 
Special Enforcement Detail member. "I thought it was a female, and I said, 
'Don't move while we search the place.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'What is your name?' and he came back with the name of 'Karen' in 
kind of a high-pitched tone. And as I started to see the face from the side, I 
could see it was a pretty unattractive female," Wilcox said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was surmising this wasn't a woman," he continued. "And as the other 
officers came around to the front, they could see it was the suspect." 
</P>
<P>
 Marwick had shaved off his large, ornate mustache, Wilcox said. 
</P>
<P>
 He had daubed on eyeliner and donned a woman's heavy, white terry-cloth robe 
in a half-finished attempt to pass himself off as a woman, Wilcox said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, another 10 minutes," King quipped, "and he might have been missing 
some plumbing." 
</P>
<P>
 The officers quickly arrested Marwick and held him overnight at the Simi 
Valley Police Department. He was transferred to the Ventura County Jail, where 
officials said he was to be held without bail.

BASIN PUMPING PROJECT COULD END SOON; NEWBURY PARK: RESIDENTS AND STATE 
OFFICIALS HAVE BEEN CONCERNED ABOUT DAMAGE TO WETLANDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 County construction workers have finished digging a giant basin in Newbury 
Park designed to catch mud and debris during a heavy rainstorm, and officials 
say the pumping of ground water from the area is expected to end this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Area residents and state environmental officials have urged the county to 
cease pumping ground water from the area because the pumping may drain wetlands 
next to the project. 
</P>
<P>
 A report released last week by the Ventura County Flood Control District said 
construction of canals around the basin will continue for several months, but 
that there would no longer be a need to pump water from the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The project's manager, Ed Gunen, said he was pleased with the progress on the 
basin, and he saw no sign of the environmental damage that some had predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, residents of the area said Friday that they are skeptical about the 
district's report. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've told us so many different times that the pumping would stop that at 
this point we won't believe it until we see it," said Newbury Park resident 
Michelle Koetke. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the meantime, people here are saying that because of the pumping and the 
hot weather, deterioration around the wetland is becoming obvious," Koetke 
said. "I just hope when they stop pumping they can restore it back to normal." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents and city officials said they are now concerned about the appearance 
of the ditch, which covers the area of a city block on Reino Road between Lynn 
Road and Kimber Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Several residents compared the rock-covered basin to a giant reservoir and 
said they were shocked when they saw what was built.  
</P>
<P>
 "Boy is it big," said Planning Commissioner Linda Parks, who recently drove by 
the basin to check on its progress. "I had no idea it was going to be that 
imposing." 
</P>
<P>
 The basin, which was constructed next to nearly 90 acres of empty, overgrown 
marshland, can be easily viewed by motorists as they pass by on Reino Road. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to soften the visual impact of the basin, county officials agreed 
in late July to take a series of steps to beautify the area around the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has agreed to plant trees along the perimeter of the ditch, 
landscape a strip of land that cuts between the basin and a hiking trail, 
remove all dirt that has been stockpiled on land around the basin and replace 
the chain-link fencing with a wrought-iron fence and stone pillars. 
</P>
<P>
 The county also agreed to replace a dozen oak trees that were removed to make 
room for the basin. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents and city officials said they thought the county should do more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they should try to make it into a park with the basin as a water 
feature," Parks said. "That way at least people can get some enjoyment out of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Koetke said she would like the area to be returned to close to its natural 
state. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping that they'll stop the pumping and let the animals use the basin 
as a kind of pond," Koetke said. "Right now it's a blight. It's an eyesore. 
Aside from the environmental impacts, it's just hideous."

OBITUARIES; KEN JONES, 72; VENTURA COUNTY DEVELOPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura developer Ken Jones died Thursday at Cottage Hospital in Santa Barbara 
after a severe stroke. He was 72. 
</P>
<P>
 His family said Jones was responsible for the construction of more than 4,500 
homes and more than 1 million square feet of commercial and industrial 
buildings throughout Southern and Central California during his long 
career.Many of those homes were in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Portland, Ore., in 1921, he moved to California in 1938. After 
graduating from Beverly Hills High School in 1939, he joined the Army, flying 
transport planes in the South Pacific during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war Jones began working in the construction industry, first as a 
general superintendent, then as a site manager and eventually making his way 
into upper management. Jones came to Ventura in 1957, when he joined the Walter 
Scholtz Building Corp. In 1970 he formed his own company in Ventura, Ken Jones 
Co., which is now headed by his son, Bradley Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 He was active in Ventura Rotary and the United Way. Formerly he was president 
of the Boy Scouts Council, a director of the Ventura Chamber of Commerce and 
president of the Building Industry Assn. of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 Also surviving are his daughter, Carolyn Purdy; six grandchildren; and 
companion Rusty Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ted Mayr Funeral Home in Ventura is handling arrangements. In lieu of 
flowers, the family asks that any tributes be in the form of memorial 
contributions to a favorite charity.

HE SEES NO SUBSTITUTE FOR TEAMWORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have enjoyed and appreciated The Times' coverage of American Legion baseball 
over the past few years. However, I take exception to the Valley Sports article 
of Aug. 3 titled, "Questions of Allegiance Cause Controversy." 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake-Royal, over the past 10 years, has had some very special players on 
its roster, including Mike Lieberthal, Matt Franco, Dave Landaker, Rob Neal, 
Shane Slayton, Tim Falsken and Brian Smith. But we'd never won more than two 
games in the Area 6 playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although we didn't have a first- or second-round draft prospect on this year's 
team, it was our best team ever. The reason is simple: total team orientation. 
</P>
<P>
 Each player was dedicated to the team concept. No player put his personal 
agenda above that of the team and each understood his role. We believe in team 
victories and team defeats. 
</P>
<P>
 The statements about the benefits of playing in the Area 6 Legion tournament 
versus trying out for the Area Code team is shortsighted and plays to the 
"me-me" mentality that pervades youth sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Few coaches rate individual performance over team play. Quite the contrary, 
team players are much more likely to succeed in college, athletics or business 
because they understand the value of working together toward a common goal. 
</P>
<P>
 The story suggests that being selfish, or protecting personal interest, has 
value in team sports. Believe me, pro scouts also attend American Legion area, 
state, regional and national events. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake-Royal's record since 1991 is 94-27-1. We are proud of this team and 
believe strongly in its team-oriented approach.

U.S. ECONOMY GAINS NEW GROUND; EMPLOYMENT: DESPITE A RISE IN THE JOBLESS RATE, 
ANALYSTS AND INVESTORS ARE FOCUSING ON THE ADDITION OF 259,000 NEW JOBS LAST 
MONTH. INCREASES IN AVERAGE EARNINGS ARE ALSO OBSERVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The nation's unemployment rate edged up to 6.1% in July from 6% in June, the 
government reported Friday, but the slight rise masked a vigorous gain in 
employment that ignited investor fears of renewed inflation and raised the odds 
of the Federal Reserve Board boosting interest rates again. 
</P>
<P>
 California's jobless rate climbed more sharply, rising to 9% last month from 
8.3%, as the state's sluggish economy continued to lag behind the nation and 
produced skimpy job increases. In Los Angeles County, the unemployment rate was 
10%, down from 10.1% in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, analysts and investors focused on a stronger-than-expected gain of 
259,000 jobs last month in the closely watched survey of employer payrolls. 
Also suggesting robust economic growth were increases in both average hourly 
and weekly earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 The job gain is "a very healthy increase and what it says is that businesses 
are still catching up with the fact that they didn't do any hiring for so 
long," said Cynthia Latta, an economist with the consulting firm of 
DRI/McGraw-Hill in Lexington, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 But Latta, echoing concerns on Wall Street about the prospects for inflation, 
said "there's got to be pressure out there pretty soon in the job market for 
higher wages." 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street over the past week had focused on reports suggesting that the 
nation's 3-year-old economic recovery was slowing slightly. Consequently, 
investors began anticipating that the Federal Reserve would not raise interest 
rates soon. But based on today's reports, investors "changed their minds 
again," Latta said, and turned their attention to the Fed's upcoming Aug. 16 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond prices fell more than one point, pushing up yields on 30-year Treasury 
bonds to 7.54% from 7.4% late Thursday. The Dow Jones industrial average 
dropped 18.77 points to close at 3,747.02. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, employers have added a hefty 2 million jobs to their 
payrolls, a strong surge that is encouraging more people to enter the labor 
force. One side effect of the influx of job hunters, though, was the jobless 
rate rose last month even as many new jobs were being generated. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month's job gain was down from the 356,000 increase in June but the July 
total, economists said, was held down by such factors as the strike at Peoria, 
Ill.-based Caterpillar Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 During July, the economy showed its biggest gains in services and retail 
trade, with restaurants, supermarkets and furniture stores all reporting 
increases. More workers also were added by temporary employment agencies, one 
of the fastest growing segments of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton proclaimed that "the future looks good," alluding to 
employment figures during a Rose Garden ceremony marking the first anniversary 
of Congress' passage of his deficit-reduction program. Clinton said his program 
"helped drive those interest rates down and got this economy moving again." 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans dissented. "The truth of the matter is, the President inherited a 
good economy when he came in," Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) told 
reporters, adding: "All he had to do was make sure he didn't mess it up. The 
economy is continuing to look fair but it's not running wild." 
</P>
<P>
 California's jobless rate remained the highest among the 11 big states whose 
employment figures were released Friday. North Carolina posted the lowest rate, 
4.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the relatively small sampling on which the state figures are based, 
California's jobless rates often are volatile. And even with last month's 
increase to 9%, it remains well below the 9.6% rate in April and the 1994 high 
of 10.1% in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists generally considered the state employment figures mediocre, but 
there was enough ambiguity in the statistics for varying interpretations -- 
particularly by politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Gov. Pete Wilson called the increase in the jobless rate a 
"temporary statistical variation" caused in part by seasonal forces, such as 
students entering the job market. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that "trends over the last several months have been moving in the 
right direction. We are encouraged in the fact that more people are seeking 
work," even though the rise in the number of job hunters helped push up the 
unemployment rate. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson's Democratic opponent in the Nov. 8 election, state Treasurer 
Kathleen Brown, said the disparity in figures nationally and for the state 
indicated to her that California "continues to be a drag" on the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to tell you I don't see it as a recovery," she said in an address in 
Long Beach to a group of women business executives. 
</P>
<P>
 The payroll survey showed a gain of 8,100 jobs in California during July, 
mainly in services and manufacturing. On the other hand, employment in retail 
and whole trade was down 3,500, and small declines were posted in three other 
industrial categories. 
</P>
<P>
 The state's figures reflect "a pretty flat economy," said Tom Lieser, an 
economist with the UCLA Business Forecasting Project. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's employment reports provide further evidence that California's 
disastrous economic slide since mid-1990 has "bottomed out," Lieser said, "but 
we'd like to see more snap to the recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Gibson, an economist for the state Department of Finance, said other 
economic indicators show that the state's actually is doing better than 
Friday's employment figures suggest. 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed to strong gains recently in the state's retail sales and payroll 
taxes, along with the continued strength of the housing market despite recent 
increases in home mortgage rates. "We're moving ahead," he said. "Not as 
rapidly as we'd like, but we're moving ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson also said he was encouraged that the state's economy has been adding 
jobs lately despite continuing cutbacks in U.S. defense spending that have 
devastated California's aerospace industry. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Friday's figures included downward revisions in job totals 
for both May and June. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, even with the job increase in July, the latest figures show 
California's employment as being down 8,100 over the last three months since 
April and up only 6,800 since the end of last year. By some estimates, the 
state's job total is still down by more than 800,000 since employment peaked in 
mid-1990. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, July's gain in manufacturing jobs may have been inflated by a 
statistical quirk. Many of the additional jobs appear to have come at food 
processing plants that hired seasonal workers earlier than usual this year, 
without actually increasing their permanent payrolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County's figures -- which, unlike the federal and state statistics 
are not adjusted for seasonal trends -- showed employment rising by 7,000 in 
July to just over 4 million. The number of unemployed fell by 2,000 to 446,000.

NATO BLASTS REBEL SERB TARGETS NEAR SARAJEVO; BOSNIA: AIR STRIKE COMES IN 
RETALIATION FOR DEFIANT WEAPONS RAID. ALLIED ATTACK DESTROYS A 'TANK-BUSTER' 
GUN. 
</P>

<P>
 NATO warplanes attacked Bosnian Serb military positions near Sarajevo on 
Friday after the rebels crowned a desperate round of provocations by seizing 
weapons from U.N. peacekeepers and forcing down a French helicopter with 
machine-gun fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen North Atlantic Treaty Organization planes, including four U.S. A-10s, 
scrambled from alliance air bases across Italy for a sundown sweep over the 
Serbian-encircled Bosnian capital, blasting at preset targets and destroying at 
least one 76-millimeter "tank-buster" gun. 
</P>
<P>
 The first use of Western air power near Sarajevo spurred an immediate bleat of 
contrition from one rebel leader, who apologized for the pre-dawn raid on the 
weapons depot and promised to give back the captured hardware, said Michael 
Williams from U.N. Protection Force headquarters in Zagreb, Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 But Williams, the senior spokesman for the beleaguered peacekeeping mission, 
voiced skepticism that the rebel military leaders have been so quickly cowed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There remains a question in our minds that the reassurances this evening are 
from the Bosnian Serb political leaders, and one would hope those reassurances 
would also apply to the military leaders," Williams said, adding that the 
mission has learned "all too often (the Bosnian Serbs) fall back into a pattern 
of provocations and difficulties." 
</P>
<P>
 Assurances that the stolen T-55 tank, two armored personnel carriers and an 
antiaircraft gun would be returned were offered by Momcilo Krajisnik, the 
self-styled parliamentary leader who often strikes a moderate pose while the 
Bosnian Serb military presses on with offensives. 
</P>
<P>
 There were reports that some of the equipment had been returned. But British 
Lt. Gen. Michael Rose, the U.N. commander in Bosnia-Herzegovina, gave the Serbs 
until today to surrender all the weapons taken from Ukrainian troops guarding a 
containment site in Serbian-held Ilidza. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose warned that he is ready to renew his call for air strikes if the Bosnian 
Serbs persist in violating a weapons exclusion zone proclaimed around Sarajevo 
in February and backed by NATO threats to bomb heavy weapons menacing the city. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. mission commanders moved swiftly to avoid the kind of retaliation 
inflicted by Bosnian Serbs after two token NATO air strikes in April against 
rebel artillery attacking the U.N. "safe area" of Gorazde. 
</P>
<P>
 All air activities in and around Sarajevo were suspended, including a food 
airlift on hold since July 20. U.N. troops in Bosnian Serbian-held areas were 
earlier redeployed out of the rebels' reach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We learned some lessons from the April experience," Williams conceded, 
alluding to instances of hostage-taking and harassment of U.N. forces after the 
earlier air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 At NATO's Southern European Command in Naples, Italy, U.S. Adm. Leighton Smith 
said a desire to avoid civilian casualties was the determining factor in 
selecting the air strike targets. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. and NATO military leaders ordered the pilots to strike only if they could 
be certain of "zero collateral damage," Smith said, using the military 
euphemism for civilian fatalities. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward air controllers reported at least one sighting of ground-to-air 
retaliatory fire during the NATO attack, a senior Pentagon official in 
Washington said. But no damage or injuries were sustained, and all aircraft 
returned safely to their Italian bases, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 The antitank weapon destroyed in the air strike was nine miles southwest of 
central Sarajevo, "well within the 20-kilometer exclusion zone," Smith told 
reporters, referring to the 12.5-mile radius delineated around the Bosnian 
capital in February. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack force consisted of four French Mirage F-1 CTs, four British Jaguar 
fighters, four Dutch F-16s and the U.S. A-10s; there was also a handful of 
support aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two A-10 "Warthogs" actually fired at the Bosnian Serb positions, said 
Capt. Rich Eich, a spokesman at the Naples headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 No bombs were dropped, but the two aircraft fired about 600 rounds between 
them from their 30-millimeter guns, Eich said. 
</P>
<P>
 At least the one M-18 antitank gun was destroyed, and NATO and U.N. forces 
were still assessing the results of the action, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House and State Department welcomed the NATO action, which was 
called for by Rose, who has previously shown reluctance to use force against 
the Bosnian Serb belligerents for fear of exposing his peacekeeping troops to 
retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of State Warren Christopher called the NATO attack a way of keeping 
additional pressure on the Bosnian Serbs to accept an international peace plan 
for Bosnia. "I think it was a good step forward today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose insisted that the attack in no way compromised the neutrality of his 
forces, saying the air strikes were "a proportionate response." 
</P>
<P>
 But by repeatedly stressing at a briefing in Sarajevo after the bombing that 
his mission is "not going to war with the Serbs," Rose may have encouraged the 
rebel leadership to continue probing the limits of Western resolve to force an 
end to the worst bloodshed in Europe since World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 At NATO headquarters in Brussels, the sense of relief was almost tangible that 
the U.N. mission had actually called for alliance air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tension between the two organizations has been more or less constant since 
NATO issued its first ultimatum Feb. 9 that led to an end of 22 months of 
artillery bombardment of Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 The alliance, eager to preserve its credibility as a potent military force, 
has often been frustrated by the United Nations' reluctance to act. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the more than two years of fighting in Bosnia, the Bosnian Serbs have 
never been more isolated diplomatically. Abandoned -- at least for the moment 
-- by their only allies of any significance in Moscow and Belgrade, diplomatic 
pressure against air strikes was virtually zero. 
</P>
<P>
 Forces loyal to Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic provoked the NATO attack 
with a series of aggressive moves against Sarajevo and U.N. forces over the 
past weeks punctuating their refusal to accept a U.S.- and European-mediated 
peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The last straw appeared to be the barrage of small-arms fire that forced down 
a French Puma helicopter that was trying to track the four heavy-artillery 
pieces stolen from the U.N. containment site around 4 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Rose appealed to the U.N. Protection Force commander, French Gen. Bertrand de 
Lapresle, for air power to punish the blatant violation of NATO's edict against 
heavy artillery being deployed within the exclusion zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Bosnian Serb tanks, guns and howitzers had been withdrawn to avoid air 
strikes ahead of the February NATO deadline. But recent reluctance to punish 
violations with force had encouraged the rebels to gradually reposition dozens 
of guns and mortars around Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. peacekeeping officials had been treading lightly in the face of Bosnian 
Serb violations, probably in the expectation that they would accept a 
negotiated settlement of the conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Karadzic and the ultranationalists who dominate his rogue government 
rejected the take-it-or-leave-it peace plan and moved to close in on Sarajevo 
by cutting off its sole supply route, grounding a humanitarian airlift and 
dramatically stepping up sniper and mortar fire against civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb fighters had put the peacekeeping mission on notice earlier this 
week that they intended to retrieve weapons surrendered to the United Nations 
in February, claiming that they were needed for battles raging elsewhere in 
Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 That prompted Rose to warn he would use any means available to him to prevent 
the weapons' recapture, including air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the U.N. hierarchy's earlier reluctance to use force against the rebels, 
coupled with a timid response by the mediating countries at a meeting in Geneva 
last weekend, probably led the Bosnian Serbs to believe the latest threats were 
also empty. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats from the United States, Russia, Britain, France and Germany have 
drafted a settlement proposal that aims to bring peace to Bosnia by dividing 
it, granting the Bosnian Serb rebels rule over 49% and a Muslim-Croatian 
federation the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 The Muslim-backed Sarajevo government reluctantly approved the plan, but the 
Serbs have repeatedly rejected it, demanding control over all conquered 
territory and the right to annex it to the neighboring state of Serbia. The 
Retaliation 
</P>
<P>
 To protect Sarajevo, NATO imposed a weapons exclusion zone around the city on 
Feb. 21. NATO had been reluctant to use air strikes. But the seizure of weapons 
by Bosnian Serbs threatened an increasingly shaky truce. 
</P>
<P>
 THE PROVOCATION 
</P>
<P>
 1) An undetermined number of Bosnian Serbs raid U.N. weapons depot, seizing a 
tank, armored personnel carriers and other weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 2) U.N. commanders send a French Puma helicopter to track the tank, but the 
helicopter is forced down by several rounds of small-arms fire. 
</P>
<P>
 THE RESPONSE 
</P>
<P>
 3) U.S. A-10 jets blast apart a "tank-buster" gun in one of four NATO 
responses. The Pentagon would not reveal the three other targets. NATO 
Involvement 
</P>
<P>
 The North Atlantic Treaty Organization's air strikes against Bosnian Serb 
targets in Bosnia-Herzegovina on Friday marked the fourth time that the Western 
alliance has used force in the civil war. Every attack has been on Bosnian Serb 
targets. Following is a chronology of NATO's growing involvement in Bosnia: 
</P>
<P>
 * July, 1992: NATO agrees to use naval force in Adriatic to review compliance 
with U.N. sanctions imposed on Serbia and Montenegro, which make up the rump 
Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 * October, 1992: NATO agrees to use surveillance aircraft to monitor U.N. ban 
on military flights over Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 * April, 1993: NATO begins combat patrols with fighters over Bosnia to enforce 
compliance with U.N. ban on flights. 
</P>
<P>
 * June, 1993: NATO offers close air support to U.N. troops and other personnel 
in Bosnia if they are attacked and request air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 * August, 1993: NATO threatens air strikes against Bosnian Serb forces 
attacking Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 * January, 1994: NATO summit meeting in Brussels confirms all previous 
decisions and says it is ready to use air strikes to help reopen Tuzla's 
airport for aid flights if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 * February, 1994: NATO gives Bosnian Serbs 10 days to withdraw heavy weapons 
from around Sarajevo or hand them over to U.N. control; otherwise, they will 
face air strikes. The Serbs comply. 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. fighters, part of the NATO force, shoot down four Bosnian Serb jets 
that violate the U.N. ban on flights over Bosnia. It is NATO's first combat 
action since it was founded in 1949 to counter Soviet military power in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 * April, 1994: NATO launches two air strikes against Bosnian Serb forces 
around Gorazde to protect U.N. personnel, the first allied attacks on ground 
targets. 
</P>
<P>
 * April 22, 1994: NATO says it will use air strikes to protect all six 
U.N.-designated "safe areas" in Bosnia and gives the Bosnian Serbs a deadline 
to withdraw from Gorazde. They comply and there are no strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Aug. 5, 1994: NATO planes hit Bosnian Serb heavy weapons that are violating 
the exclusion zone around Sarajevo after the rebel Serbs remove arms from a 
U.N. weapons depot.

HITTING THEIR STRIDE; NORTHRIDGE LITTLE LEAGUE'S ALL-STAR TEAM IS UNDEFEATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOCELYN Y. STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 She's not listed on the score card, but as the members of the Northridge 
Little League all-star team will tell you, they owe a lot of their success to 
"Susan." 
</P>
<P>
 She's neither the shortstop nor a coach. She's a bat. 
</P>
<P>
 To be precise Susan is a Louisville Slugger TXP, and when this team that 
boasts an 11-0 record plays a division tournament final tonight in Rialto, 
she'll be there. 
</P>
<P>
 If she does her job, the team of 11- and 12-year-olds will advance to the 
Western Regional where they could play teams from Alaska, Washington and 
Hawaii. Even with a loss tonight, Northridge could still win the 
double-elimination tournament with a victory Sunday. If they do advance to the 
regional, it will be the first time a Valley team has gone that far since 1975, 
Coach Larry Baca said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we ride up to Rialto we talk about how we're going to play the game, 
what we're going to do," said Matthew Fisher, 12, leaning against the dugout 
wall at a diamond in Northridge. "And we talk to our bats." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday afternoon as the team practiced under a scorching sun, their talk was 
of baseball, Susan, and winning. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Susan is just a part of this team's success. The players work hard, 
practicing two to 2 1/2 hours a day. They listen to their coaches. They 
encourage each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have faith in my team," said Todd Delevie, 12. "We have skill all around."  
</P>
<P>
 Baca agrees. The team has an outstanding pitcher, Nathaniel Dunlap, but Baca 
adds that all the players are talented. Baca, who has been coaching Little 
League since 1981, says the team has something more vital than just physical 
talent. The players combine positive attitudes with a willingness to work 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you start having kids that are selfish and thinking of their own stats, 
the team will suffer," Baca said. 
</P>
<P>
 Team members resemble players in the big leagues in some respects. These boys 
of summer have rituals too, things that they do before a game, just to make 
sure that talent, skills and hard work equal produce another win. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Nesbitt wears his socks inside out "for good luck." 
</P>
<P>
 Before every game, Matt Cunningham's mom gives him a bag of "Big League Chew," 
a fluorescent green, sweet-smelling bubble gum, that the team members pack in 
their mouths like chewing tobacco. 
</P>
<P>
 And then they have their talks with Susan. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course the conversation is pretty one-sided at first: 
</P>
<P>
 "We say, 'You gotta get me a couple of hits today,' " Matthew Fisher 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, " 'These guys think we can't hit, so show 'em,' " Peter Tuber added. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the players admitted to at least some anxiety before a game that has 
such high stakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not really nervous," Greg Wallace, 11, said confidently. Then he added: 
"I am a little bit, but our best pitcher is pitching." 
</P>
<P>
 Spencer Gordon, 12, who plays right field, makes sure he rests well before 
each game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try not to get too nervous, because then I don't do as well," Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
 There were plenty of reasons why this group of boys should not have done well 
this year. They are, after all, from Northridge, and many had their homes 
damaged and lives disrupted by the January earthquake. But baseball has 
provided solace, a way to forget, if only for a few innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Cassel, 12, had to move out of his house after the quake. When there was 
no power in his neighborhood and everybody's home was in shambles, he and his 
friends went to the diamond. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was the only thing we could do," he said. "We just played sports." 
</P>
<P>
 If the team wins tonight, and wins the Western Regional, they will advance to 
the World Series in Williamsport, Pa. 
</P>
<P>
 But the team is taking it one step at a time, and talking to Susan all along 
the way. Does the bat ever talk back? 
</P>
<P>
 "Last game it did," Peter said, laughing and slapping hands with Matthew. "We 
went five for five."

'I WAS SO HAPPY'; DISABLED WOMAN SEEKS STATE OK TO GO 'HOME' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tracy Grimes would like to live with people who love her and take care of her. 
She would like a room of her own and to be near children during the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Until a few months ago, Grimes -- who is severely disabled due to a brain-stem 
injury -- was living with a Chatsworth family who gave her all these things. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the state took them away. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the family home did not have a community care facility license, 
officials from the state Department of Social Services ordered Grimes to leave, 
threatening the family with a $200 fine for every day she stayed. 
</P>
<P>
 So in April, Grimes, 32, moved to a Northridge board-and-care facility, where 
she has no privacy, where the only entertainment is the TV, and many of the 
other residents are too sick to talk. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of the American Civil Liberties Union, Grimes filed a lawsuit 
Friday against the California Department of Social Services to return to the 
place she considers home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just like what everybody likes," said Grimes, during an interview in the 
living room of Gabrielle and Frederick Hanna, the couple who cared for her. 
This was Grimes' first time back in the house since she was forced to move. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just like a normal person. I want to live in a place where they love me 
and I'm in the family," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this basically comes down to is the right of disabled people to choose 
where they want to live," said Beth Osthimer, a lawyer with San Fernando Valley 
Neighborhood Legal Services, which is also helping to represent Grimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes' situation falls through the cracks of current state policies. 
Regulations allow family members to care for their elderly and disabled 
relatives in homes without a license. State laws also encourage people to 
return to their own homes after the onset of a disability, by providing In-Home 
Support Services payments. 
</P>
<P>
 But state DSS officials say all other severely disabled people must live in a 
licensed facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone who is disabled and is not covered by another law cannot choose to 
live just anywhere," said David Dodds, a program development chief at DSS. 
</P>
<P>
 For Grimes, the issue is not simply one of personal choice. The facility where 
she now lives charges about $1,000 a month for room, board and care. Her Social 
Security benefits, which are her sole means of support, come to about $650 a 
month. The deficit has been made up since April by a friend and by members of 
Grimes' church. 
</P>
<P>
 Now those funds have dried up. 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to find a less expensive facility have been unsuccessful. 
</P>
<P>
 "If something doesn't happen," said attorney Esther Epstein of Neighborhood 
Legal Services, "Tracy will be homeless as of Sept. 7." 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes suffered her brain-stem hemorrhage in 1987 when she was seven months 
pregnant. The boy was successfully delivered, and now lives with Grimes' 
mother. But Grimes said her mother cannot care for her. 
</P>
<P>
 The injury left Grimes paralyzed on her left side, partially paralyzed on the 
right side and partly blind. She needs assistance to move her wheelchair, to 
dress, shower and use the bathroom. Her speech is slurred, but she is alert and 
enjoys talking. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes' life was grim until she met the Hannas in 1991 at church in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 "She became like our sister," said Gabrielle Hanna. The family visited her 
regularly at the facility and began taking her on family outings. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year they asked her if she would like to move in with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so happy," Grimes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes had her own room and enjoyed the company of the Hannas' three sons. 
Gabrielle quit her job as a computer operator to stay home with her. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes contributed $528 out of her Social Security benefits toward the house's 
rent. She and the family expected that she would also be able to designate 
Gabrielle as her care-giver and pay her the approximately $900 a month she 
expected to get in state benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 But a government inspector in March said that the house would need to be 
licensed for Grimes to continue to live there. "They were treating us like we 
were a business," Gabrielle said, gesturing around the living room. "Does this 
look like a business? I took a cut in pay to do this because we wanted her 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 To get a license, the house would have needed a major remodeling to conform to 
state regulations. Then in a Catch-22 situation, Grimes would no longer be 
eligible for state benefits: The payments are meant for people being cared for 
at home, not in a licensed facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes said she has faith that she will be back with the Hannas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think God put his hand on my shoulder and said, 'You'll be OK.' "

RELIGION / JOHN DART; EVANGELICAL CHRISTIANS A SHRINKING COMMUNITY, POLL FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite the growing political impact of what critics call the "Religious 
Right," a pollster who specializes in religious issues reports that its 
demographic base is shrinking, with the percentage of theologically 
conservative Christians steadily declining nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 7% of the U.S. population consists of people with "evangelical" beliefs 
and commitment, compared to 9% last year and 12% in 1992, under a standard 
designed by pollster George Barna, founder and president of the 10-year-old 
Barna Research Group in Glendale, who is personally sympathetic to the 
evangelicals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The movement of the data suggests that we may see a continued shrinking of 
the ranks of evangelicals in the immediate future, short of a miraculous 
outpouring of God's Spirit upon the people of our land," Barna wrote in a 
recently published book. 
</P>
<P>
 Barna and the better-known George Gallup Jr. are among the most active 
pollsters who regularly take the nation's religious pulse. Despite occasional 
questions about accuracy, the results of their surveys have been increasingly 
watched as indicators of how faith is faring in an age of religious pluralism. 
</P>
<P>
 About 35% of Americans fall under Barna's less stringent category of 
"born-again Christian." The figure, which had dropped to 32% in 1988 after a 
series of televangelist scandals, rose to 40% in 1992, but has fallen again, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although religion in some form remains "very important" to 62% of Americans 
(compared to 59% in 1991), the proportion of adults who strongly agree that the 
Bible is totally accurate in its teachings dropped from 47% three years ago to 
38% this year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many people who might have held orthodox (Christian) views in the past 
have embraced a much broader set of beliefs," Barna said in an interview. 
"There is a big trend toward a diverse and inclusive spirituality." 
</P>
<P>
 This decline indicates that the strictest evangelical Christians, a prime 
recruiting ground for the Religious Right, may be shifting gradually to a less 
stringent outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 Barna, however, said he was not prepared to interpret what that might mean for 
politically active, religiously motivated groups such as Pat Robertson's 
Christian Coalition that have become more prominent within the Republican Party 
and in local governments. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't done any research on that question," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, findings published this month in Barna's "Virtual America" (Regal Books), 
indicate some slippage in the proportion of Americans who might respond 
favorably to appeals based on a fundamentalist-like understanding of the Bible 
and Christianity. Barna's book interprets the results of telephone surveys of 
1,205 adults in July, 1993, and 1,206 adults in January. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A steady 95% of adults continue to say they believe in God or a universal 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 About 67% of those polled agreed with a Christian definition of God as "the 
all-powerful, all-knowing Creator of the universe who rules the world today," 
-- a substantial drop from 73% in 1992, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest survey, 10% called God "a state of higher consciousness," 8% 
agreed with a definition of the "total realization of all human potential," 
another 8% offered other descriptions and about 7% said they could not define 
God, according to Barna. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Barna's company does surveys and market research for both secular and 
religious clients, his 18 books are written for an evangelical audience. He 
recently became executive pastor of a church in Oceanside, where he and his 
wife have a second home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not the type who likes to just research and observe," Barna said. "I 
wanted to serve in a local church on weekends, in this case, one that is 
multicultural and aggressive evangelistically." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, Gallup does not hide his active involvement in the Episcopal 
Church.  
</P>
<P>
 Both pollsters use standard public-opinion research techniques, however, said 
sociologist R. Stephen Warner of the University of Illinois at Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 "One difference between them is that Gallup tends to be optimistic and Barna 
seems to be pessimistic in interpreting results," said Warner, who was in Los 
Angeles this week for the national meeting of the Assn. for Sociology of 
Religion. 
</P>
<P>
 Confidence in the accuracy of religious polling, at least in measuring church 
attendance, was shaken about a year ago when a sample study of actual 
Protestant and Catholic church attendance suggested that it is only half the 
40% or so who tell Gallup and Barna's pollsters each year that they attended a 
worship service in the previous seven days. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Gallup and Barna rely on the truthfulness of survey respondents. Critics 
have speculated that some people give answers they believe will make them look 
good. 
</P>
<P>
 The critical study was done by three researchers, Kirk Hadaway of the United 
Church Board for Homeland Ministries, Cleveland; Penny Long Marler of Samford 
University, Birmingham, Ala., and Mark Chaves of the University of Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharply contested by sociologist-priest Andrew Greeley as "a sloppy piece of 
work," the study was praised by Gerald Marwell, editor of the American 
Sociological Assn. journal that published it. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner takes a moderate stance on the study. "It was a very important, solid 
piece of work, but not impeccable. It was provocative but not definitive," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I also find it implausible that half of the people who said they attended 
services are lying," Warner added. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in 1993 the Gallup Poll found that when an attempt was made to pin 
down the respondents -- by asking them to name the church or synagogue where 
they attended services in the previous week -- the percentage of those who 
described themselves as churchgoers dropped only 1%. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-one percent said yes to the usual question and 40% said yes when also 
asked to name the place of worship, according to Gallup's Princeton Religion 
Research Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the responses Barna received to questions dealing with Christian 
broadcasting and reading material showed such large audiences that he thinks 
they "cannot possibly be an accurate portrayal of reality." 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, he said that 35% of those surveyed said they had watched a 
televised church service or other Christian program in the past seven days. 
That would translate to as many as 70 million adults per week nationwide, which 
Barna views as implausible. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, 22% (which would represent about 40 million adults) said they read a 
"magazine devoted to Christianity or to activities of special interest to 
Christians." Yet a very generous estimate of the national readership of 
Christian periodicals would be 20 million people, Barna said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently, many people continue to believe that being associated with 
(Christian media) is still a socially desirable characteristic," he wrote. And 
perhaps many intended to watch the programs or read the publications, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Naturally, some people are simply lying or posturing, seeking to convey an 
image they desire, although it conflicts with their actual behavior," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another possibility, Barna said, is that people are defining "Christian" more 
broadly -- to include socially and politically conservative media -- which he 
does not. 
</P>
<P>
 "For instance, one study we conducted discovered that the most widely read 
'Christian' magazine was 'Reader's Digest,' " Barna wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another study revealed that among the most listened to 'Christian' radio 
programs were 'The Paul Harvey Report' and Rush Limbaugh's talk-radio program," 
he said. About the Survey 
</P>
<P>
 Pollster George Barna categorizes his survey respondents as "born-again 
Christians" if they fulfill two criteria -- that they have an ongoing, personal 
commitment to Christ that is still important today, and they believe they are 
heaven bound because they have confessed their sins and accepted Jesus as their 
savior. 
</P>
<P>
 To be classified in the stricter "evangelical" category, Barna says they must 
agree with those two statements plus six others: that religion is important in 
their lives, that God is an all-powerful, all-knowing Creator and ruler of the 
world, that you cannot get to heaven just by doing good things, that the Bible 
is accurate in all that it teaches, that Satan is a living force and not 
symbolic, and that they have a personal responsibility to tell other people of 
their religious beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 All others he categorizes as "non-Christians."

LANDFILL GAS CONVERTED TO ELECTRICITY; ENERGY: GLENDALE'S $10-MILLION PROJECT 
IS ONE OF EIGHT SUCH SYSTEMS IN COUNTY. IT IS THE MOST POWERFUL ONE IN THE 
VALLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VIVIEN LOU CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 At the turn of a valve, gas created by garbage rotting at a local landfill was 
used to generate enough electricity for 30,000 homes Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 It sounds like an environmentalist's dream, but the process is becoming a 
reality for municipalities across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight such systems are now being used at landfills and power plants throughout 
Los Angeles County, according to sanitation officials. Three of them, including 
Glendale's, are in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's landfill system is on the verge of a crisis as the capacity to 
hold solid waste diminishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Diverting landfill gas toward power plants will do little to improve the 
condition of dumping grounds, say officials with the Sanitary Districts of Los 
Angeles County. But many agree that gas-to-energy systems are good for the 
environment and can sometimes generate a profit for participating agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a win-win-win all the way around," John Cosulich, a supervising engineer 
with the sanitation agency, said of a similar operation in Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindy Jacobs, who works for the federal Environmental Protection Agency, has 
been assigned specifically to encourage greater use of the process nationwide. 
"We view them as being extremely environmentally beneficial," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale's $10-million project is the most powerful gas-to-energy system in 
the Valley, capable of reaching two to three times the number of households 
served by the other sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Methane and carbon dioxide naturally emitted by decomposing trash at the 
Scholl Canyon Landfill is collected, treated, compressed and dehydrated with 
equipment at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 It is then transported to the city's power plant 5 1/2 miles away via a 
pipeline beneath city streets. 
</P>
<P>
 When it reaches the Grayson Power Plant, the gas is blended with more methane 
gas and used to fuel the boilers that produce electrical power. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Glendale Mayor Eileen Givens smashed a champagne bottle against an 
above-ground portion of the pipeline and turned a large valve that ushered the 
landfill gas into the power plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We come together to publicly dedicate this pipeline," she told a gathered 
audience. "My city colleagues would want me to say, 'It's been a real gas.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually everyone involved with the project -- city officials, the developer, 
homeowners and officials with the Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County -- 
expects to benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 Over 20 years, Glendale city officials anticipate revenues and savings of $40 
million stemming partly from fewer dollars spent on gas needed to operate the 
power plant. 
</P>
<P>
 The project's developer, Palmer Capital Corp. of Massachusetts, will sell the 
treated gas to the city for at least $330,000 a month, a discount of 12.5% from 
what the city spent for natural gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Weaver, president of the Glenoaks Canyon Homeowners Assn. and a civil 
engineer, considers the pipeline safe from unexpected accidents. "This is not 
going to blow up," he said. "It's not under that kind of pressure. We explained 
that to our members." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sanitation Districts of Los Angeles County, which operates the Scholl 
Canyon Landfill, does not share in any money generated by the Glendale project, 
but it earns more than $40 million a year from the Puente Hills Landfill in 
Whittier by selling electricity to Southern California Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 Other gas-to-energy operations are located at the Bradley and Penrose 
landfills in Sun Valley, and landfills in Pomona, Palos Verdes, West Covina and 
the Griffith Park area. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than three years of negotiations, Glendale city officials allowed 
installation to begin on the pipeline -- mostly along Lexington Drive and 
Glenoaks Boulevard -- in January. It was completed six months later. 
</P>
<P>
 The Scholl Canyon Landfill collects about 2,000 tons of garbage a day from 
Glendale, Pasadena, Sierra Madre, San Marino and unincorporated parts of Los 
Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Garbage takes years to decompose. But all landfills emit methane gas around 
the clock, a substance that environmentalists say contributes to smog and 
global warming. 
</P>
<P>
 Methane gas collected at the Glendale landfill had been set afire and released 
into the atmosphere regularly, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The alternative (to gas-to-energy systems) is much worse environmentally," 
said Maribel Marin, a senior research associate for the Natural Resources 
Defense Council. "This method is by far superior." Pipeline Project A "gas to 
energy" pipeline opened Friday in Glendale. Gas from decomposing refuse at 
Scholl Canyon Landfill will be piped to Grayson Power Plant, then treated and 
converted to electricity. Source: City of Glendale

 Leaders of Glendale's Armenian-American community plan to honor the Glendale 
Adventist Medical Center team that donated its services last month to 
rehabilitate a wounded Armenian freedom-fighter. 
</P>
<P>
 Local Armenian organizations paid to bring the 22-year-old soldier, Artour 
Ovtchian, to the hospital in June after he was partially paralyzed defending 
the war-torn Armenian Republic of Nagorno-Karabagh. 
</P>
<P>
 The young soldier was released from the hospital walking with a cane three 
weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Ovtchian, along with community leaders, will speak at a reception Tuesday for 
the team of physical therapists and other hospital staff members who helped him 
get back on his feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The reception is scheduled to begin at 4 p.m. in the hospital's auditorium. It 
will be hosted by the Armenian National Committee, Armenian Culture Foundation 
and the Armenian Relief Society. JILL BETTNER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; PAROLE OFFICE SHOULD STAY, COMMITTEE SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A state parole office should remain in Sherman Oaks despite pressure from 
residents and politicians opposed to it, leaders of a citizens advisory 
committee said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no documentation that there is an increase in criminal activity," 
said Don Schultz, chairman of the committee, which ironically was created by 
state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys), one of several politicians fighting 
to have the parole office moved. 
</P>
<P>
 Schultz made his remarks at a press conference Friday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowing to political pressure, state officials in May announced that the parole 
center -- which had just moved into a new building in Sherman Oaks a month and 
a half earlier -- would be closed and moved to North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents contended that the Sherman Oaks facility, directly across from a 
park, violated state Department of Corrections guidelines for locating a parole 
facility.  
</P>
<P>
 But Schultz said that those fears were overblown, and that crime is no worse 
in the neighborhood because criminals are unlikely to congregate in the park 
knowing that armed parole officers are in the building across from them.  
</P>
<P>
 At the press conference, Los Angeles City Councilman Joel Wachs said he 
opposes the move to North Hollywood -- which is in his district -- although he 
does not necessarily agree that it should stay in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that they made a decision based on political pressure and not 
by involving the community in the process before a decision was made," Wachs 
said. "I think each community should bear its fair share of the 
responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 State Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Panorama City) said that moving to the North 
Hollywood site, which he called an inferior facility, would be a waste of $2 
million that the state Department of Corrections spent in its search for the 
new Sherman Oaks site. 
</P>
<P>
 By recommending that the facility remain in Sherman Oaks, the committee failed 
to do the job given to them by Roberti, which was to find an alternative site, 
said Sandy Miller, Roberti's chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sole purpose of the committee was to work with the Department of 
Corrections to find a site the three communities would be happy with," Miller 
said, adding that Sherman Oaks representatives have been out-voted on the 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just not giving them the answer that they wanted to hear," Schultz 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee has sent a letter to Gov. Pete Wilson asking for the decision to 
move the facility be overturned. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee vote on the issue -- two weeks ago -- was 7 to 1 in favor of 
keeping the office in Sherman Oaks. Opposing the action was Patricia Boyd of 
Sherman Oaks, who said she objects to keeping the office at its present 
location because of its proximity to the park, as well as to a senior citizens 
center. She added that the rent is more expensive than it had been.  
</P>
<P>
 Boyd was the only representative from Sherman Oaks who was included in the 
vote. The two other representatives were absent that day, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it could have been worked out more amicably," Boyd said. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; PLANNED RALLY AIMED AT RESCUING LIBRARY

 With budget cuts that have left the San Fernando branch of the Los Angeles 
County Library teetering on the brink of obsolescence, the library manager is 
organizing a march on San Fernando City Hall to try to save it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't sleep at night," said Judith Babka, manager of the library, which has 
been in San Fernando for 80 years. "I've been in libraries for more than 40 
years in five different countries. I can't believe this is happening to a 
public library system that serves so many people." 
</P>
<P>
 Babka, who is originally from Australia, will lead the march Aug. 15, the same 
time as a 6 p.m. San Fernando City Council hearing on whether to approve a 
community facilities district to pay for the library. Under the proposal, the 
city would charge single-family houses $28.50 a year to support the library. 
Other residential properties would pay less. 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando is one of 52 cities in Los Angeles County that are considering 
setting up assessment districts to save their public libraries. 
</P>
<P>
 The library's annual budget to buy books, magazines and other materials has 
been cut steadily in recent years, from $48,500 in the 1991-92 fiscal year to 
$500 for 1993-94. The library currently has no materials budget and is running 
on funds borrowed from other county sources until its fate is decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Budget cuts last year forced the library to cut the number of days it is open 
from six days a week to three. If the assessment district is not approved, the 
library would only be able to stay open two days a week, Babka said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this measure does not pass, we will not have any materials budget," said 
Babka, explaining that the library would have no resources to buy new books, 
but may be able to buy a handful of magazine subscriptions. "In the long run, 
that means we go out of business, because we would be obsolete." 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating budget cuts, Babka started hitting the streets in recent months, 
selling T-shirts and trying to collect donations as well as resurrecting 
Friends of the San Fernando Library, a support group that had been inactive 
since the mid-1980s. ED BOND

 The city of San Fernando will receive more than $1 million in federal funds to 
help revitalize multifamily housing damaged by the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The funds will be allocated through the Housing and Urban Development Home 
Partnership program, which provides funds to damaged housing critical to 
neighborhood revitalization efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Howard Berman (D-Panorama City) said special emphasis will be placed on 
rebuilding a "ghost town" area that straddles the Sylmar-San Fernando boundary. 
</P>
<P>
 "These funds will help apartment and condo owners in San Fernando's ghost town 
get their units back on the market," Berman said. "Many of the damaged 
apartments and condos were occupied by hard-working, low-income individuals. 
These people are the lifeblood of the community, and we must ensure that they 
continue to have decent and affordable places to live." ALICIA DOYLE

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; FUND-RAISING GROUP FOR SCHOOLS REVIVED

<P>
 The Las Virgenes Educational Foundation is being revived after an eight-year 
hiatus to raise money for computers, satellite links and other high-tech 
equipment to bring students into the information age. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are significantly behind our counterparts in other areas of the country, 
in terms of technology," Supt. Albert (Bud) Marley said. "We have to go way 
beyond having computer labs to where youngsters are using the technology in the 
regular classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 Adrian Stern, an unsuccessful candidate in the Las Virgenes school board race 
in November, has spearheaded revival of the foundation, which was established 
in 1982, but had fallen dormant by 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 In its latest incarnation, Stern said, the foundation will seek gifts and 
raise money solely for technological improvements approved by the district, 
rather than for various proposals by individual schools, which the original 
foundation considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Stern, acting president of the foundation until officers are elected this 
fall, envisions classrooms equipped with large TV monitors with 
touch-responsive screens, spelling lessons on CD-ROM and students doing 
research on the information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you put a child in front of a computer, there's an excitement that gets 
in their eye," Stern said. "You get lessons with dancing graphics and a voice 
that always says, 'Great job,' or 'Let's try again.' The computer is very 
patient." 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation will recruit board members from the teachers union, parents, 
administrators, the district board of trustees and the community, Stern said. 
The foundation's first fund-raiser is scheduled Oct. 20. Money will be sought 
mostly from local businesses and corporations, rather than parents and current 
school supporters. 
</P>

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: BUYERS ELIGIBLE FOR QUAKE LOANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Prospective apartment building owners can apply for a total of $24 million in 
low-interest loans to buy quake-damaged buildings under a new program approved 
Friday by the Los Angeles City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's unanimous vote to issue $24 million in bonds will provide three 
banks and lending institutions money to lend to buyers at an interest rate of 
4% to 5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new program, Home Savings of America, First Federal Bank and 
Glendale Federal Bank, the three institutions chosen to participate in the 
program, will lend the money and will be responsible for paying off the bond. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the program is to get new buyers to repair and rent out damaged 
apartment buildings that were abandoned after the quake, said Gary Squier, 
manager of the city's housing department. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials decided not to lend the money themselves -- as they do in other 
quake recovery programs -- because they wanted to cut out some of the 
bureaucracy and allow the lending institutions to use their judgment on 
selecting borrowers, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the program proves to be effective, Squier said, the city may take out a 
second bond in the near future. HUGO MARTIN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CANOGA PARK; ADULT BOOKSTORE RULING POSTPONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM CROGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Canoga Park residents will have to wait at least three more weeks to learn if 
the Los Angeles Zoning Department will restrict the operating hours of Le Sex 
Shoppe, the area's only adult book and novelty store. 
</P>
<P>
 In a sparsely attended meeting Friday at the Sherman Oaks Women's Club, Zoning 
Administrator John Parker postponed action on the request filed in May by Capt. 
Valentino Paniccia, commander of the Los Angeles Police Department's West 
Valley Division, to revoke the shop's permit.  
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Laura Chick supports revoking the permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker told supporters of the store that he will hold the Le Sex Shoppe file 
open for a week to see if a compromise on a voluntary set of restrictions can 
be worked out between the shop and the police. 
</P>
<P>
 A follow-up hearing on the matter will be scheduled during the next three 
weeks. Le Sex Shoppe's zoning problems go back to 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we had this problem settled through hearings and a compromise four 
years ago," said Pat Quinn, a homeowner and Neighborhood Watch member. "The 
city, the police and local residents have all spent money to get these problems 
solved, but nothing ever seems to change."  
</P>
<P>
 Located on Sherman Way near Owensmouth Avenue, the 24-hour store sells 
sexually explicit books, magazines and video tapes, which can be rented or 
viewed in on-site, private screening rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Paniccia said he made his request because of longstanding solicitation and 
lewd conduct problems in and around the store. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been working on the Le Sex Shoppe situation for the four years I've 
been in charge here and maybe six years before that," Paniccia said. "There's a 
lot of anger and disgust expressed by people in this area with the ongoing 
cruising, solicitation and sex acts in the alleys behind the store." 
</P>
<P>
 "Since the earthquake, the problems have gotten worse," Paniccia said. "Le Sex 
Shoppe in North Hollywood closed down, so those customers are coming here. The 
increase in customers is also attracting more prostitutes and we're arresting 
both men and women for solicitation." 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Tony Vlaskamp, a West Valley vice officer who testified in support of 
revocation, said that from January, 1992, through April, 1994, the Police 
Department made 117 arrests at the store, mostly for solicitation and lewd 
conduct. But Robert DePiano, attorney for EWAP, the corporation that owns the 
Le Sex Shoppe chain, insisted that his client is taking steps to stop illegal 
activity around the store and is willing to do more.  
</P>
<P>
 Those efforts, he said, include hiring a 24-hour security guard, fencing in 
the back lot and closing it after 10 p.m., monitoring inside screening rooms 
and posting signs warning patrons not to engage in illegal or publicly lewd 
conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to work with the community and the police to be good neighbors," he 
said. "But we're strongly opposed to a limitation on our operating hours 
because we believe it violates a freedom of speech issue. We will be very 
aggressive in protecting those rights." JIM CROGAN

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: SUPERVISORS REJECT PARKS UPKEEP TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bowing to objections from homeowners, the Los Angeles County Board of 
Supervisors has rejected a proposed $24-per-household tax that would have 
helped pay for the upkeep of some parks and public swimming pools. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision came Thursday after the board heard testimony that the tax would 
place an unfair burden on the 375,000 residents of the unincorporated areas who 
would pay it. 
</P>
<P>
 Since county parks officials proposed the tax earlier this summer, the board 
has found other revenue sources to fund a projected $8.1 million for parks, 
said Joel Bellman, spokesman for Supervisor Ed Edelman.  
</P>
<P>
 Edelman urged the other supervisors Thursday to approve the tax anyway, saying 
it would be necessary in the long run because the current revenue sources are 
temporary. 
</P>
<P>
 But his motion failed to get a second, dooming the tax. TRACEY KAPLAN

WOMAN WHO GAVE INJECTION FACES CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles city attorney's office Friday filed charges of practicing 
medicine without a license against a woman who gave an antibiotic injection in 
a home clinic to a man who collapsed and later died of a severe throat 
infection. 
</P>
<P>
 An arrest warrant was issued for Refugio Sandoval, 59, who police said fled to 
Sonora, Mexico, in April after Jesus Nicolas Anchondo, 22, of Arleta died at a 
local hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoval was not charged with his death because the Los Angeles County 
coroner's office determined that he died of natural causes -- severe strep 
throat -- and not from the injection. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they found a room full of illegal drugs at Sandoval's home on 
Hesperia Avenue, some of which are banned in the United States, along with 
syringes and other medical paraphernalia. Investigators determined that the 
illegal drugs had come from Mexico and confiscated about 120 containers of 
medication, 81 of which are considered dangerous drugs available only by 
prescription, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoval also was charged with illegally practicing medicine under 
circumstances that could have caused great bodily harm, administering a 
controlled substance with a license, operating a business or trade without a 
license, possession of a hypodermic needle and unlawful use of a hypodermic 
needle, according to a statement from the city attorney's office.

2 GET JAIL SENTENCE IN LOAN SCAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two North Hollywood men were sentenced to jail and ordered to pay restitution 
Friday after they pleaded guilty to charges that they used a phony loan scam to 
swindle hundreds of people across the country out of roughly $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernest Straughter, 30, and David Allen Straughter, 34, were part of a 
telemarketing scheme that solicited advance fees from victims for loans that 
were never made, according to the Los Angeles city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Using slogans such as "Personal Loans. Bad Credit Okay. Easy to Qualify," 
operators of the scam invited people to call a toll-free number for loans. When 
victims responded, they were told they qualified for a loan, but that to get it 
they had to send at least $250 by overnight delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men each pleaded guilty to two counts of grand theft. Ernest 
Straughter was sentenced to six months in jail and David Straughter to nine 
months. David Straughter has agreed to help prosecutors convict others involved 
in the scam. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men were arrested late last month. Another man arrested with them -- 
39-year-old Walter Brown of Van Nuys -- pleaded not guilty to charges and is 
scheduled to stand trial Aug. 15 in Los Angeles Municipal Court.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; DEPUTIES SEEK WOMAN IN PALMDALE FIRE; CRIME: A 
FORMER TENANT MAY BE A SUSPECT IN THE BLAZE, WHICH CAUSED $260,000 DAMAGE TO 
THE APARTMENT BUILDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Sheriff's deputies were searching Friday for a woman suspected of setting a 
fire that destroyed a four-unit, two-story apartment building in central 
Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze, reported at 12:30 a.m., caused about $260,000 damage at 38458 10th 
St. East. In recent years, city code enforcement officers have found health and 
safety violations at the building, and it went into foreclosure late last 
month, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the blaze, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Lt. Dave 
Collin. American Red Cross workers were arranging shelter for three displaced 
tenants. Collin said the building was believed to be a total loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies declined to identify the suspected arsonist, but said she had been a 
tenant in the building. "One of the witnesses indicated to us that they saw her 
throw a lighted candle on a mattress," Collin said. 
</P>
<P>
 No motive for the arson is known, said Sgt. Larry Crookshanks of the Sheriff's 
Arson-Explosives Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Ashley, a tenant in an adjacent apartment building, complained Friday 
that a previous landlord allowed trash to pile up and did not maintain the 
utility services. She said it was fortunate that none of the tenants or their 
children were hurt in the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire people got here just in time," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The building is located in a Palmdale area targeted by Partners Against Crime, 
PAC, a combined effort by deputies, city officials and community leaders to 
combat crime and neighborhood blight. 
</P>
<P>
 PAC Deputy Lee D'Errico said that some health and safety problems had occurred 
in the building, and that illegal drug transactions had taken place in front of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Morrisey, the city's senior code enforcement officer, said his staff had 
moved to correct relatively minor violations at the site in past years, 
including a buildup of trash, inoperative or wrecked vehicles on the grounds 
and pirated electricity. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrisey said the current owner, Home Savings, had been notified about the 
fire and was expected to quickly authorize the placement of a protective fence 
around the damaged structure.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; RARE COINS, BANK NOTES STOLEN FROM STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than $20,000 worth of rare coins and antique bank notes were stolen from 
a liquor store by thieves who bypassed the store's alarm by using a screwdriver 
and a tire iron to punch a hole in the roof, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The burglary occurred between 11 p.m. Wednesday and 8 a.m. Thursday at 
Discount Gourmet Liquor, 23644 Lyons Ave., according to Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Deputy Tracy Judson. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities have no one in custody, Judson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Items taken included a $15,000 collection of silver U.S. coins, a $1,200 
collection of 19th-Century silver dollars and $2,000 worth of antique bank 
notes. Also stolen was about $3,000 cash and $11,000 worth of other items such 
as a laptop computer and a collection of pocket watches, Judson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my life savings and my kids' collection of coins," said Ronald Winkel, 
the store's owner. He declined further comment about the burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 An 18-inch hole was cut in the roof of the store using a screwdriver and tire 
iron that were found on a desk under a cash register drawer, according to 
Judson's report. The roof was about 16 to 18 feet above the floor, but a 
refrigerator that reached to within eight feet of the roof apparently served as 
a ladder for the burglar or burglars. 
</P>
<P>
 The store's alarm was not triggered because it was connected to the doors and 
windows, Judson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the items taken were at various locations in the office, but the rare 
coins, cash and a handgun were locked in a metal paper towel dispenser on a 
wall because Winkel was sure no one would think to look there, according to 
Judson's report.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CRACKDOWN ON EAST NEWHALL DRUG DEALERS LEADS 
TO ARREST OF 11; CRIME: RESIDENTS HAD LONG COMPLAINED OF NARCOTICS-RELATED 
ACTIVITY. STING OPERATION BY UNDERCOVER OFFICERS COMES AFTER A TWO-MONTH 
INQUIRY.

<P>
 Juan Cansino said the damage inflicted by the Northridge earthquake was only 
the beginning of the deterioration of his neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The 22-year-old east Newhall resident said that after the temblor, drug 
dealers moved into abandoned residences and set up business in the alleys near 
the home he shares with his 3-year-old daughter.  
</P>
<P>
 He said he called the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department a couple of 
months ago to report the trouble, but doesn't know if officers took him 
seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 "Normally, you'd see 10 to 12 people out here doing their thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents of the area complained of street lights being shot out so drug 
dealers could operate without police spotting them, windows being shot out by 
those under the influence of drugs and alcohol and the shooting of a security 
guard by an alleged gang member. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, the Sheriff's Department was listening. 
</P>
<P>
 Undercover officers with the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station arrested 
11 people in a sting operation from 3 to 9 p.m. Thursday after spending nearly 
two months observing the area near the intersection of Pine and Market streets, 
said a narcotics officer, who asked not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said that problems in the neighborhood had worsened in recent 
months. But they said they believe rising gang activity in the area had more to 
do with the increased drug activity than the problems caused by the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appeared the people were engaged in blatant drug sales," the narcotics 
officer said. "We went out and saw it, and it looked like a sting operation 
would stop it and send a message to the buyers and sellers to beware." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies posing as drug buyers arrested two people selling crack cocaine by 
seizing a small amount of the drug, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Brad Stone. The 
officers then took over the dealers' business location and sold a replica of 
the drug -- crushed macadamia nuts -- to seven people, who also were arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the buyer started to walk off they would give a signal to one of the 
deputies monitoring the transaction, and they would notify a uniformed deputy 
who would pull the person over and arrest them," Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two additional people were arrested for trying to warn potential buyers about 
the sting operation, Stone said. 
</P>
<P>
 All 11 suspects were male Latinos between 23 and 42 years old, authorities 
said. Five live in the Santa Clarita Valley and six are San Fernando Valley 
residents.  
</P>
<P>
 Cansino looked gratefully at the empty alley behind his house as he washed his 
car there Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, the neighborhood is a little bit quieter at night so people can sleep," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Run-down apartments and multifamily homes make up much of the lower-income, 
predominantly Latino neighborhood, where dozens of children often can be seen 
playing. Lt. Bill Dunn said the neighborhood has always had some degree of drug 
and gang problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "People call us saying they've been approached by a prostitute willing to 
exchange sexual favors for rock cocaine and such things," he said. "I think 
it's safe to say we get information regularly about those types of activity in 
that area and periodically we act upon it when appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 But several residents in the area said the problems since the earthquake are 
the worst they can remember. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of kids over here, and we're scared," said a 23-year-old man 
who has lived in the neighborhood for nine years. "These people drink and do 
drugs and then they start to get crazy and shoot." 
</P>
<P>
 The man said he was afraid to be identified and that similar fears have kept 
other residents from calling sheriff's officials. But he said he was glad to 
see deputies out in force Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was feeling a lot better," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Lt. Barbara Persten said she isn't sure the earthquake is solely -- 
or even primarily -- responsible for the recent increase in drug activity. She 
said a recent increase in gang activity in the area is a more likely factor. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they didn't have those places (damaged by the earthquake), they'd probably 
have somewhere else to sell out of," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the neighborhood's problems aren't over yet, said Sheriff's Deputy Greg La 
Val of the station's Career Offenders Burglary Robbery Apprehension (COBRA) 
unit, which investigates gang crimes. Four people were injured in gang-related 
shootings in early July, and there have been numerous related crimes recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you all the details . . . but we're still working on this," he 
said.

BOY HOSPITALIZED AFTER HOT TUB FALL; ACCIDENT: JASON NYERGES, 4, WAS UNDERWATER 
FOR FIVE TO 15 MINUTES. HE IS IN CRITICAL CONDITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A 4-year-old boy was in critical condition after falling into a hot tub and 
sinking to the bottom for five to 15 minutes before his siblings, who were 
swimming in an adjacent pool, noticed his disappearance, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Nyerges was being taught to swim by his five older brothers and sisters 
when the accident occurred at 2 p.m. Thursday at their Placerita Canyon home, 
said Deputy Mark Wood of the Santa Clarita Valley Sheriff's Station. The boy 
had no pulse and was not breathing when deputies arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got there, for all practical purposes the kid was dead," Wood said. As 
Wood started performing CPR, "I could feel his lungs were full of water." 
</P>
<P>
 Wood and Susan Vaziri, another sheriff's deputy, performed CPR on the child 
for about five minutes before firefighters arrived and took him to Henry Mayo 
Newhall Memorial Hospital in Valencia, where an hour of emergency care revived 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 The water in the hot tub was lukewarm instead of fully heated, which may have 
saved the toddler's life, Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the water's colder it slows down your blood circulation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason was then transferred to Kaiser Foundation Hospital in Los Angeles, where 
he is on a respirator and listed in critical condition, said Linda Quon, a 
hospital spokeswoman. She said the prognosis for his recovery is uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a while to determine if there is brain damage," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The children live with their father, who was at work when the accident 
occurred. The youngsters, between the ages of 13 and 6, were using the pool and 
hot tub while the housekeeper, Daisy Santos, was cleaning inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood said all of the children except Jason knew how to swim. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Jason's brothers, Jimmy, 10, said he was getting out of the spa and 
thought Jason was following him, Wood said. But instead of getting out, Jason 
apparently reached for a toy gun at the bottom of the spa and fell into the 
four-foot deep water. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just didn't know how to swim," Wood said. "He probably panicked and tried 
to breathe and got his lungs full of water." 
</P>
<P>
 The hot tub was elevated above the pool, so Jason's siblings couldn't see him 
even though they were swimming only a few feet away, Wood added. They began 
searching for him after they finally realized he was missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Wood said he believes the child was probably underwater for seven to eight 
minutes, but because the family was in a panic, the actual time could have 
varied by several minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason's siblings brought him into the kitchen and laid him on the floor as 
Santos phoned for help, the deputy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters took the boy to the hospital, where after an hour of care his 
heartbeat and a low level of blood pressure were restored, officials said.

EASLEY'S BAT KEYS ANGELS' RARE VICTORY; BASEBALL: HIS TWO HOMERS ARE AMONG THE 
ODDITIES IN 5-3 TRIUMPH OVER CHICAGO THAT STOPS NINE-GAME LOSING STREAK AT 
HOME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Predictability took a beating Friday night at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The new, $3.6-million scoreboard went on the fritz for the first five innings 
of its scheduled debut, but all things considered that hardly ranked as the 
most shocking event of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 There was so much more to ponder in the Angels' 5-3 victory over the Chicago 
White Sox in front of 30,274. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel second baseman Damion Easley, batting .211 when the night began, hit not 
one but two home runs in a three-hit, three RBI night. He hadn't homered in 
almost three months before Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago first baseman Frank Thomas, having a season of Ruthian proportions, 
went hitless in four plate appearances. He did walk once. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel reliever Russ Springer kept the White Sox hitless in 1 1/3 innings to 
earn his second career save. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Angels stopped a nine-game losing streak at home, winning for only the 
third time in 14 games overall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, baby," Manager Marcel Lachemann said. "A win anywhere is nice, but a win 
here is especially nice." 
</P>
<P>
 Until Easley stepped to the plate in the bottom of the fourth inning Friday, 
the Angels appeared to find their usual rut, playing their distinctive brand of 
listless baseball to the hilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago built a 2-0 lead on solo home runs by Robin Ventura, in the second 
inning, and Julio Franco, in the fourth, off Angel starter Chuck Finley (9-10). 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels mounted little in the way of offense against Chicago starter Wilson 
Alvarez until Easley's two-run homer in the bottom of the fourth tied the 
score, 2-2. It was Easley's fifth homer this season, but his first since May 10 
against Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 By his next at-bat, in the seventh, Chicago had regained the lead, 3-2. But 
Easley hit a 3-and-2 pitch from Alvarez over the left-field wall for a 
bases-empty homer, completing the first two-home run game of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Edmonds' one-out, run-scoring double later in the inning gave the Angels 
the lead for good at 4-3. It was preserved by Springer, who extended a modest 
streak of scoreless innings to 12 2/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 That might not sound like much, but it's the longest streak by an Angel 
reliever this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Easley has suffered perhaps the most dismal slide of any of the Angel hitters, 
enduring an eight for 49 skid (.163) in his past 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
 In 36 games since returning from the disabled list with an inflamed right 
shoulder on June 17, he had batted a punchless .177 (22 for 124). 
</P>
<P>
 He said he believed it will take more than one big game to snap him from his 
doldrums, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rod (Carew, Angel hitting coach) and I have talked about everything from the 
mental side of the game to fundamentals," Easley said. "It's just a matter of 
me doing it. Hopefully, this is part of a lesson I have to learn. I wish it 
wouldn't have taken so long for me to wake up. 
</P>
<P>
 "By no means is it in my head to hit home runs. But I've done a lot of things 
this year that I don't normally do. Muscling pitches was one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't think I'm a power hitter. I'm not. I'll be out here early (today taking 
batting practice)." 
</P>
<P>
 Easley had been slotted to be the everyday second baseman when the Angels 
overhauled their infield in early June. But he has struggled so much, he has 
shared the position with Harold Reynolds and Rex Hudler. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a gifted young athlete," Lachemann said of Easley, a .313 hitter before 
shin surgery ended his 1993 season in August. "I honestly believe he will come 
around." 
</P>
<P>
 Without Easley's contributions, the Angels' frustrations might have continued 
unabated Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets to the point where it looks like you get something rolling, like when 
we swept Boston (July 18-20), but . . . " Lachemann said. "To play at the level 
we're playing and still be in the race is probably the most frustrating part of 
this thing." 
</P>
<P>
 With a week left before the expected players' strike, set to begin next 
Friday, and the last-place Angels starting the game 8 1/2 games out of first 
and a season-low 21 games below .500, it seemed like a moot point. 
</P>
<P>
 The calendar shows it's early August, but the mood among the Angels (45-65) 
this past week seemed more like the last week of a forgettable season. And 
certainly they were not in contention. 
</P>
<P>
 But for one night at least, Easley injected a little life into the Angels.

HE'S BACK AND ABOVE PAR AGAIN; AZINGER'S FIRST ROUND AN EMOTIONAL SUCCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 As the sun played hide and seek with the low, gray clouds that gathered over 
the Warwick Hills Golf and Country Club Friday afternoon, a Buick Open official 
named Randy Hutton turned to the crowd and nervously announced history. 
</P>
<P>
 "From Bradenton, Fla.," said Hutton, a herd of cameras and boom mikes pointed 
his way, "please welcome back to the game . . . Paul Azinger." 
</P>
<P>
 You would have thought it was thunder, not applause that mushroomed from that 
10th tee box and echoed across the fairways and greens as Azinger stepped 
forward. Nine months he had been gone, six of them fighting cancer. Now he was 
back. Thinner. Older. Touched by fear of an early death. 
</P>
<P>
 Cancer can do that. 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger, 34, tipped his hat as the applause and whistles kept washing over him 
in waves. He smirked. He nodded. He fought back tears. Then he planted a tee in 
the wet grass, placed a Titleist No. 2 atop it, tossed a few blades in the 
afternoon air, took a deep breath, tugged at his sleeve, pulled at his belt 
loop, gripped his club, took his stance, drew the Big Bertha back at exactly 
12:51 and hoped. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to hit a heel hook into the crowd and kill somebody," he would 
</P>
<P>
 say later. 
</P>
<P>
 Let the record show that his first PGA Tour shot since last November plopped 
hard against the middle of the fairway, at which point Azinger playfully 
knocked his knees together in near collapse, clutched his heart and then 
exchanged a high-five with playing partner Corey Pavin. 
</P>
<P>
 The comeback, nothing more than an afterthought during the dark hours of 
chemotherapy and radiation treatments, had begun. 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger shot an opening-round, four-over-par 76, which put him about a 3-wood 
and 2-iron away from the top of the leaderboard, 11 strokes behind Fred Funk. 
Not that it mattered. Seventy-six . . . 106, who cared? 
</P>
<P>
 "The greatest victory for me was just going out there today," Azinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 This was only Azinger's ninth round since his recovery, only his second 
hitting balls to yardages, only his first when it counted. It showed. Azinger 
couldn't make a putt, couldn't control the ball out of the rough, couldn't feel 
. He hit trees. He chunked a few chips. He spent some time in beachfront 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just knocking the rust off," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are worse fates -- such as hearing Dr. Frank Jobe tell you a biopsy has 
revealed lymphoma, which is what happened to Azinger last December. Since then, 
golf has moved from the front seat, to the back seat, to the trunk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just happy to be here," said Azinger, who recorded 10 pars, six bogeys 
and two birdies. "I was in pretty bad shape about five months ago. I've made 
the turn now." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody knows exactly when the cancer cells began to assemble for their 
would-be death march. As long ago as 1987, the same year Azinger won his first 
PGA tournament, the same year he lost the British Open to Nick Faldo by 
bogeying the final two holes, there was a disturbing twinge in his right 
shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger told himself it was nothing. Probably too much Ping-Pong. That was it 
-- he hadn't warmed up before grabbing a paddle. Anyway, it sounded good. 
</P>
<P>
 White lies only work for so long. Four years later, the twinge had become a 
throbbing ache, enough so that surgery was required. With Azinger's nervous 
blessings, Jobe not only repaired the shoulder, but also removed a tiny piece 
of bone for a biopsy. 
</P>
<P>
 Just to be on the safe side. 
</P>
<P>
 As Jobe had predicted, the biopsy revealed nothing. Azinger returned to the 
elegant golf wars, and by 1993 the Tour was his for the taking. His swing was 
sweet. His name was a regular on leaderboards. Life was good. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Memorial, trailing by one and needing a tiny miracle to beat his good 
friend Payne Stewart, Azinger hooked his approach shot on No. 18 into a 
greenside bunker big enough to film "Beach Blanket Bingo." He stomped into the 
sand, choked down on a wedge and then caressed the shot into the cup for a 
birdie. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart three-putted for a bogey. Azinger had his first victory of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But it didn't stop with the Memorial. Azinger won three tournaments in all, 
including the prized PGA Championship, his first major title. He recorded 10 
top-three finishes, the most since Tom Watson's season in 1980. He was the 
tour's second-leading money winner. 
</P>
<P>
 And his shoulder hurt. Burned actually. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1993 U.S. Open, he could feel bumps on the bone. That wasn't right, was 
it? 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger underwent a bone scan and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) test: 
Nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 When he won the PGA at Inverness last August, staring down Greg Norman in a 
dramatic playoff, he needed anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics to do it. 
The pain didn't affect his swing, but it took all his might to lift the 
Wanamaker Trophy above his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger thought he might have a muscle injury, possibly a chipped bone. Or 
maybe there was something wrong with a tendon. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobe knew it wasn't that simple. Never is. Midway through the PGA, he called 
Azinger and requested another biopsy. Azinger said not now and told no one of 
the news except his wife, Toni, and his caddy. 
</P>
<P>
 He played in five more tournaments, but when the pain worsened, Azinger agreed 
to a Nov. 30 biopsy. While flying from Palm Springs to Los Angeles for a Dec. 2 
meeting with Jobe, Azinger pulled out his bone scan negatives and began peering 
at the black and milky images. With him was Stewart, who saw what Azinger saw: 
a dark mass at the shoulder blade. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Dave Kindred of Golf Digest, Stewart, whose father had died of 
cancer, looked at his friend and asked: "What's the black?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know yet," Azinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial diagnosis was promising. No malignancy was found. Then came the 
biopsy results and the Dec. 2 appointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, Dr. Jobe, how am I?" said Azinger, who had brought Toni and their two 
young children. 
</P>
<P>
 Jobe told him the truth and the truth was this: Azinger had lymphoma, the 
cancer -- if you can believe it -- with a heart. If caught in time, it was the 
most curable (90%) of the awful categories of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger underwent more tests, this time to see if the black had spread. For 
three days, he and his family waited for the news. A cancer vigil, that's what 
it was. 
</P>
<P>
 At last came the results. The lymphoma was restricted to the right shoulder 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 It was cause for a strange joy. Azinger could live . . . but only if he began 
immediate chemotherapy treatments at Inglewood's Centinela Hospital Medical 
Center, where Jobe practices. Radiation would come later. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd throw up for two or three days after the chemo treatment and be gaggy for 
another seven or 10 days, and the next 20 were pretty normal," Azinger said 
earlier this week at a news conference. "After that, radiation was like a walk 
in the park. There were no side-effects from radiation, except for a burn on my 
shoulder, like a real bad sunburn. 
</P>
<P>
 "But if you've got to do chemo, brother, you know you're sick. I don't know 
how else to say it." 
</P>
<P>
 The ordeal didn't go unnoticed. Faldo, the man who beat him at the British 
Open in 1987, wrote a letter of encouragement. So did Seve Ballesteros, the guy 
who once accused Azinger of cheating, the guy who Azinger accused of 
showmanship. So did Jose Maria Olazabal . . . and thousands of other fans 
touched by Azinger's bout. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Miller called and reminded Azinger that life is measured more by 
obstacles overcome than by goals achieved. Azinger has never forgotten the 
words. Gene Litler, who battled cancer more than 20 years ago, also phoned and 
offered encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger was touched by the gestures. He realized how much he valued life and 
how much he enjoyed golf. 
</P>
<P>
 "I miss seeing that 7-iron leave on the perfect trajectory, loaded up with 
spin and stopping in there next to the hole," he said. "I miss hitting those 
wedges knee-high to a grasshopper, whipping it in there pin-high. I miss that a 
lot. I miss the feeling of what it feels like to hit a shot dead on, when you 
don't even hear the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger no longer spends part of his day feeling for cancerous lumps, and his 
straw-colored hair, which fell out in clumps during the chemotherapy, has begun 
to return. Even so, when he made a cameo appearance in the Memorial locker room 
earlier this year, fellow touring pros didn't recognize him. He had lost hair, 
lost weight -- about 20 pounds to 155 -- and lost contact with a game he played 
with a passion. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday wasn't much different. While walking up the 10th fairway, Azinger saw 
fellow pro Tom Lehman on the adjoining fairway and waved hello. A day earlier, 
Lehman had left a nice note on Azinger's locker. Now Azinger wanted to say 
thank you. 
</P>
<P>
 One problem. "He didn't recognize me," Azinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger finally took off his hat, tapped his short hair and waited. Lehman 
squinted and then smiled. It was "Zinger." 
</P>
<P>
 Lehman blew him a kiss. 
</P>
<P>
 He birdied No. 13, a 548-yard par-five. That's when Pavin patted him on the 
back. "Congratulations on your first birdie of the year," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Azinger bogeyed the next two holes. After missing a five-footer for 
par on No. 15, he was steaming. He hit his drive on No. 16 and then turned to 
his caddy. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, if you're ever worried about me losing my competitive desire, don't 
worry," Azinger said. "I'm so mad right now I could spit nails." 
</P>
<P>
 This was good. A couple of months into chemotherapy, Azinger questioned 
whether anything, with the exception of his family, his religion and life 
itself, was worth fretting over. Now he knows. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the round, as he waited on the eighth tee box, Azinger glanced at the 
electronic scoreboards, which keep a running total of everyone's score. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I'm beating the crap out of four guys my first week back," Azinger 
said, "and don't think I won't let them know about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger did better than that. He finished ahead of 12 other players and tied 
the defending Buick Open champion, Larry Mize. 
</P>
<P>
 When the round was finished, Azinger signed every cap, card, program, golf 
ball, shirt, magazine, photograph and scrap of paper shoved in front of him. He 
called it "a privilege." 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger was weary physically, tapped out emotionally. His back was sore, his 
legs aching. It had been a long day. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'll tell you what," he said, "it beats the alternative."

MONDESI CARRIES DODGERS; BASEBALL: ROOKIE RIGHT FIELDER SPARKLES WITH TWO 
TRIPLES, TWO RBIS AND BIG PUTOUT AT PLATE IN 5-4 VICTORY OVER ROCKIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It was the largest crowd Raul Mondesi had ever played in front of and perhaps 
the largest the Dodgers have seen in the regular season since the days of the 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday night at Mile High Stadium, a crowd of 70,283 saw the all-around 
talent of Mondesi, who tripled twice, scored a run, knocked in two and threw 
Charlie Hayes out at the plate in the Dodgers' 5-4 victory over the Colorado 
Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Mondesi's league-leading 15th outfield assist and it was a key out in a 
big jam for Ramon Martinez (11-7), the winningest Dodger pitcher. Mondesi, 
though, believes the assist is secondary to the triples, asking how many 
players have seven triples? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is not many. Mondesi ranks fourth in the majors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two triples is good," he says.  
</P>
<P>
 An abundance of sometimes unharnessed talent, Mondesi not only showed what he 
can do, but what he shouldn't do, such as slowing down on a triple off the 
left-center field wall, when he could have scored. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I had hit it out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Or trying to score on the two-run triple he hit to right field in the sixth 
inning, nearly running down Henry Rodriguez. Mondesi, who said that once in 
winter ball he actually passed a runner, was thrown out in a rundown.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned about Rodriguez and I look up and see Mondesi and I say, 'What 
the heck is he doing?' " said third-base coach Joey Amalfitano. "He actually 
startled me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers made the game exciting for the Rockies, and agonizing for Manager 
Tom Lasorda, who has endured 49 one-run games this season in which they are 
28-21. The Rockies, who came back to move within one run entering the ninth 
inning, had runners on first and second with two outs against closer Todd 
Worrell, who struck out Dante Bichette to end the game and earn his 10th save. 
</P>
<P>
 Since giving up three runs against the Giants on July 25, Worrell has pitched 
very well. In his last five outings -- six innings -- he has given up no runs 
and three hits. But one of those hits was a leadoff single to Nelson Liriano, 
then, two outs later, Worrell got a bad break when a routine grounder by Mike 
Kingery to Tim Wallach hit the edge of the infield grass and skimmed off. But 
he got out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "His velocity is better and he is getting ahead of guys and he is getting more 
confidence," catcher Mike Piazza said. "He knows his role now and Tommy 
(Lasorda) has shown faith in him, and it's good to see him." 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda also has faith in his rookie right fielder, who tripled and scored the 
Dodgers' first run in the third inning, and knocked in another two runs in a 
four-run sixth inning, which put the Dodgers ahead, 5-2.  
</P>
<P>
 Down 2-1, Brett Butler walked to lead off the inning and two outs later, 
Wallach, Eric Karros and Rodriguez each singled, scoring two runs and knocking 
out starter Curtis Leskanic. Reliever Steve Reed came in, and Mondesi hit his 
second triple, this one a slicing opposite-field line drive to right.  
</P>
<P>
 With a three-run lead, Martinez bore down, but Hayes, who has three hits in 
the game, homered in the sixth and the Rockies scored again the seventh. But it 
was that jam in the fourth inning that Martinez escaped, because of Mondesi, 
when he threw out Hayes at home plate.  
</P>
<P>
 Hayes had led off with a single to left with the Rockies ahead by one run and 
one out later moved to third on another single by Vinny Castilla. Joe Girardi 
followed with a hard-hit grounder down the right-field line that Mondesi 
charged, fielded and unleashed to Piazza. Meanwhile, Girardi, who was rounding 
first, saw Mondesi charging, and dove back to first. But Mondesi's one-hop 
throw was right on line, and Piazza stayed back and made a good tag on Hayes.

BRICKYARD 400 SET TO MAKE HISTORY; MOTOR RACING: RECORD BOOKS AWAIT WINNING 
DRIVER IN TODAY'S NASCAR RACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHAV GLICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Most serious motor racing fans know that Ray Harroun won the first 
Indianapolis 500 and that Lee Petty won the first Daytona 500. 
</P>
<P>
 But how many know who won the second 500 at each track? 
</P>
<P>
 The Brickyard 400 will take place today at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, and 
Dale Earnhardt believes the winning driver will take his place alongside 
Harroun and Petty as landmark names. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnhardt has won 62 Winston Cup races and six championships and has gone from 
working out of his family's backyard garage in Kannapolis, N.C., to head a 
multimillion dollar conglomerate, but he badly wants to win NASCAR's first 
foray into Indy car territory. Today's 400-mile race is the first for any type 
of machinery except Indy cars on the Speedway oval. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm proud to come in here as the defending champion for NASCAR and Winston," 
Earnhardt said after practicing Friday in his Richard Childress-prepared 
Chevrolet Lumina. "The Indy mystique is everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every place we go, it's what people want to talk about. We had an open house 
back home (in Welcome, N.C.) at Childress' shop this past weekend, and close to 
30,000 people came through and everybody had something to say about Indy. It 
was the same last Wednesday night in Pittsburgh. That's not NASCAR country, but 
about 5,000 people showed up for an autograph session and it was no different 
from North Carolina. They were talking Indy, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now it's time to go out and make a little history of our own by winning the 
race for the first time. That's what we're here for and I can't wait." 
</P>
<P>
 Earnhardt will start on the front row, alongside surprise pole-sitter Rick 
Mast, a journeyman driver from Virginia who has never won a Winston Cup race in 
141 starts. Mast qualified his Ford Thunderbird Thursday at 172.414 m.p.h., 
which earned him a $55,000 bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Gordon, who celebrated his 23rd birthday Thursday by qualifying 
third-fastest at 171.125 m.p.h., collected a $5,000 bonus as the youngest 
starter in the race, but he wants more. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been so nervous and so happy at the same time," said the young 
driver who moved from Vallejo, Calif., to Pittsboro, Ind. when he was 15 
because California laws prohibited him from racing. "I don't know about this 
place. Even though it pays the same points as the other races, there isn't 
anybody who can't say that this place is a little more special." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Mark Martin, who is third in points behind Ernie Irvan and 
Earnhardt, said he doesn't consider it special. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're preparing for this one just like we do for every other event," Martin 
said. "We want to win North Wilkesboro and Martinsville just as bad as we do 
the Brickyard 400." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvan, the series points leader from Salinas, Calif., had a disappointing 
qualifying speed of 169.453 m.p.h. and will start his Ford from the ninth row 
in the two-by-two lineup. Next to Irvan will be Geoff Brabham, driving in the 
first stock car race of his career, after a distinguished Indy car and sports 
car career. 
</P>
<P>
 A.J. Foyt, four-time Indy 500 winner, ended his 15-month retirement, squeezing 
into the 40th and final spot for the Brickyard with a 168.596-m.p.h. lap 
Friday. He edged Joe Ruttman by three one-thousandths of a second. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was nervous as hell," Foyt said. "I was just trying to get it close and not 
screw up." 
</P>
<P>
 It will be the 59-year-old Foyt's 36th start here after driving in 35 
consecutive Indy car races from 1958 through '92. He will receive $5,000 as the 
oldest qualifier. 
</P>
<P>
 Three were given provisional starting berths, including Mike Chase of 
Bakersfield, the only Winston West driver in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who missed qualifying were Hershel McGriff, 66, who could coax 
only 162.449 m.p.h. from his Ford. Ben Hess of Wadsworth, Ohio, and Robert 
Sprague of North Bend, Ore., both suffered concussions in separate single-car 
accidents Friday and were taken to the intensive care unit of Methodist 
Hospital for observation. 
</P>
<P>
 And, oh yes, Joe Dawson won the second Indy 500 and Junior Johnson the second 
Daytona 500.

DREAM TEAM II ERASES DOUBTS IN 132-77 ROUT; BASKETBALL: IMPRESSIVE 41-18 RUN IN 
FINAL 9:20 OF FIRST HALF IGNITES DRUBBING OF CHINA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Now pursuing a niche as the second-best team of all time, Son of Dream Team 
chased away its blues, laying a good old-fashioned American whipping on poor 
China. 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans played hard this time, they conceded. Don Nelson played his 
bench-warmers, Dominique Wilkins and Steve Smith, in the first half and 
everyone enjoyed Friday night's 132-77 rout in half-empty Copps Coliseum, 
except the Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were trying to win by 60 or 70," Wilkins said. "We discussed it in the 
locker room before the game. We wanted to bury this team. We were predicting a 
win by 50." 
</P>
<P>
 What were they predicting before the game against Spain? 
</P>
<P>
 "A win by 40 or 50," said Wilkins, laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 China, a textbook pigeon, had the usual problems matching up with the U.S. and 
was also coming off an overtime victory over Brazil the night before. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese managed a 2-0 lead on Wu Zheng's 15-footer but that was as good as 
it got for them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before the competition, we have already known who the winner will be," said 
Chinese Coach Xingquu Jiang, "but we are not so happy because we did not 
anticipate losing the game by so many points." 
</P>
<P>
 In another of his fits of hyperbole here, Nelson said the Chinese have "the 
best passing team in the tournament" and devised a game plan to counter it. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Dream Team Coach Chuck Daly, who changed his lineups nightly, Nelson 
again trotted out his Game 1 starters -- Shaquille O'Neal, Shawn Kemp and three 
guards -- possibly on the theory they were staying in until they got it right. 
</P>
<P>
 Once more, Nelson applied the pressure. This time it looked like pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese turned the ball over 21 times in the first half, including eight 
times in their first 18 possessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States outscored the Chinese, 41-18, in the last 9:20 of the half, 
finishing with a 12-0 run in the last 57 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, who had held Wilkins and Smith out until the closing minutes of the 
opening game and suggested he was going to continue playing it that way, put 
both in early and gave them as many minutes as his other reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins made seven of nine shots (all but one layups or dunks) and said he was 
happy again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a lot of fun," he said. "Everybody got a chance to get in the action. 
That's all you can ask for. . . . It's good to get in there early, get in the 
flow, be a part of things. It was fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what you'd call it but everybody here deserves the right to play 
in these games. That's the way I look at it." 
</P>
<P>
 With the lead in the high 50s, U.S. players on the bench cheered their 
teammates' shots as if they had incentive bonuses riding on the outcome. But 
the intended 60-point victory slipped away  
</P>
<P>
 "Winning by 55 has got to say something," said Wilkins. "We got the monkey off 
our back now. We're ready to do some damage." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Nelson: "We played hard the entire game. I don't think that was true the 
first game. We got a big lead and then it was like NBA quote, unquote garbage 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, garbage time started Thursday and will run until the finals Aug. 14. 
World Basketball Notes 
</P>
<P>
 In the late Pool A game, Juan Antonio San Epifanio, 35, who has played for the 
Spanish national team since he was 17 and is probably the most popular player 
in the country's history, scored all of his 18 points in the second half of a 
73-67 victory over Brazil. San Epifanio, known as Epi in Spain, played his 
225th game with the national team. Only two other players on the current roster 
have played as many as 100. Spain (1-1) and China (1-1) will play Sunday with 
the winner advancing to the quarterfinal round. The loss almost definitely 
keeps Brazil (0-2) from advancing to the quarterfinals unless it can upset the 
United States on Sunday. . .. . In Pool B, Croatia (2-0) and Australia (2-0) 
clinched quarterfinal berths, Croatia with a 104-53 thrashing of South Korea 
(0-2) and Australia with a 93-87 victory over Cuba (0-2). They meet today with 
only the pool title at stake. Toni Kukoc led Croatia with 12 points on 
six-for-six shooting, while handing out 10 assists in just 25 minutes. Andrew 
Gaze had 30 points to lead Australia. . . . In Pool C, Russia (2-0) cruised 
past Angola, 94-57, while Boston Celtic Rick Fox scored 17 of his 19 points in 
the second half in unbeaten Canada's 91-73 victory over Argentina, clinching a 
spot in the quarterfinal round along with Russia. Argentina (0-2) and Canada 
were tied 30-30 at halftime before Kory Hallas (31 points), who had 19 after 
halftime, and Fox took over with a barrage of jumpers and layups to put the 
game away. . . . In Pool D, Michael Koch had 27 points to lead Germany to an 
81-74 victory over Puerto Rico as both teams go to 1-1. Greece remained 
unbeaten with a 69-53 victory over Egypt (0-2).

BECKER FIGHTS BACK, BUT NOT AGASSI; L.A. OPEN: GERMAN STAR LOSES FIRST SET BUT 
RECOVERS TO DEFEAT BRAASCH. AMERICAN WINS FIRST SET THEN FALLS TO AUSTRALIA'S 
STOLTENBERG.

 Consider Boris Becker and Andre Agassi. Two athletes with distinctly different 
styles. 
</P>
<P>
 One has a crew cut, the other has hair longer than most fashion models. One 
likes to play by day, the other only comes alive at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker and Agassi could not be any different in personality. And they looked 
that way on the court, too, Friday in the quarterfinals of the Los Angeles Open 
at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Agassi fell behind and never regained his composure in a 4-6, 6-2, 6-3 loss to 
Jason Stoltenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 A few hours earlier, Becker came back from the dead, saving two match points, 
to defeat eighth-seeded Karsten Braasch, 2-6, 7-6 (7-1), 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixth-seeded Stoltenberg, who grew up playing on an ant-bed tennis court that 
his father made for him in Australia, will play second-seeded Becker tonight at 
7:30 p.m. in the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoltenberg took advantage of an agitated Agassi in the third set. Leading, 
2-1, the Australian sent a passing shot to the left corner to break Agassi and 
never looked back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything fell into place," Stoltenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Agassi, who was troubled by a questionable line call in the game, things 
were anywhere but in place. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think tonight I definitely rushed my shots against him. I didn't feel like 
I was sticking to my strengths," Agassi said. "I was taking early chances, 
which is a big mistake for me." 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope it keeps going," Stoltenberg said. "I don't know what the secret is." 
</P>
<P>
 Stoltenberg might want to figure out that secret before he meets Becker, who 
suddenly came alive to defeat Braasch after a slow start. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker, ranked 11th, insists that he does not intentionally start slow. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is just that I play opponents, like Karsten, who are expected to lose and 
they come out firing all guns," he said. "That was the correct way for him to 
start but that is not necessarily the best way to start a match, starting at 
110 percent." 
</P>
<P>
 Becker initially was thrown off-balance by the unconventional hitch in 
Braasch's serve. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a very awkward serve and a very difficult motion to read," Becker 
said. "He just plays awkward tennis. I don't know anybody who plays like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Braasch, also from Germany, easily took the first set and the first three 
games of the second set. 
</P>
<P>
 But suddenly, Braasch, ranked No. 40, began to slip, hitting one shot into the 
net and sending the next two wide before double faulting to give Becker a break 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was that little hope I was hoping for," Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker worked his way back into the set until he trailed by just one game, 
5-4. With Braasch leading, 30-15, Becker scrambled along the baseline and 
lunged for a backhand that barely landed in Braasch's court. Braasch tapped the 
ball back into Becker's court to set up match point. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, Braasch looked through his goggles across the net and saw something that 
wasn't there before: some fire in Becker's eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 And he double faulted. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that point I just didn't have the guts to go for it," Braasch said. 
</P>
<P>
 What made Braasch lose his nerve? 
</P>
<P>
 "It was Boris Becker," Braasch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Braasch hit a backhand into the net to lose the next match point. Becker won 
the next two points before Braasch hit a backhand volley into the net to give 
Becker the game and tie the score, 5-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Becker had finally appeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where ya been, Boris?" someone yelled from the stands as Becker won the next 
game to take a 6-5 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Braasch held serve to tie the game, 6-6, but it was too late. Becker's serve 
began to hit its target and everything started to click for the three-time 
Wimbledon champion. Becker allowed Braasch just one point in the tiebreaker and 
rolled through the third set. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never really give up matches," Becker said. "In the back of my mind there 
is that little voice telling me, 'Keep on going, keep on going.' "

MORNING BRIEFING: DEFIANT SCHOTT GETS SMOKING ON CAMPAIGN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cincinnati Reds owner Marge Schott, a smokers' rights advocate, has launched a 
campaign to make smoking legal again in the city's Riverfront Stadium. Schott 
has disobeyed the city's no-smoking ordinance by smoking in her seat. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has scheduled a hearing for her appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 All major league stadiums but one -- New York's Shea Stadium -- have smoking 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Schott says the Riverfront smoking law is a reason the first-place Reds are 
having an attendance decline this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, it was announced that Schott has been chosen grand marshal of the 
Ohio Tobacco Festival's Aug. 26 parade in Ripley, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Name the only major league pitcher whose strikeouts and age, in 
one game, were the same? 
</P>
<P>
 Big bang theory: Author John Feinstein, who wrote "Hard Courts," a book about 
professional tennis, after spending a year on the circuit, has an idea on how 
to improve the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Feinstein: "Put all the people involved in tennis in one room, and then 
blow up the room." 
</P>
<P>
 For what it's worth: When Joe Carter hit his 300th home run the other day, he 
became the 65th major leaguer to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Media boycott?From John Steigerwald, in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, before 
the recent ceremonies at Cooperstown, N.Y.: "(Steve) Carlton will be inducted 
into the Baseball Hall of Fame this weekend. It would be fitting if the media 
walked out during his acceptance speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more you hear what Steve has been saying lately, the more you realize how 
fortunate America was that he refused to speak to the media all those years." 
</P>
<P>
 Instant star: Triple-A Vancouver Manager Don Long, who joined the Angel 
coaching staff for a week, was excited when he heard a fan recognize him. 
</P>
<P>
 Long acknowledged him and started to walk over to autograph a baseball, when 
the kid holding it yelled: 
</P>
<P>
 "Could you go get Bo Jackson's autograph for me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Said Long: "I should have known." 
</P>
<P>
 Babe seminar: Hofstra University, which has held numerous symposiums on U.S. 
presidents, is organizing one for Babe Ruth.  
</P>
<P>
 Ruth's life will be the focus of a history conference next April, celebrating 
the 100th year since his birth. Hundreds of historians, journalists and 
baseball experts are expected to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Fare deal: Fred Perry, the 1934, '35 and '36 Wimbledon champion, was honored 
on his 85th birthday during the recent Wimbledon tournament.  
</P>
<P>
 Said Perry, after receiving awards and accolades: "If there is anything I can 
do to help the game anywhere in the world, I am happy to do so . . . provided 
you pay the fare." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Bob Feller, 18, when he struck out 18 Detroit Tigers on Oct. 2, 
1938.

POSTCARD / ST. PETERSBURG; HERO'S PAST CATCHES UP WITH HIM IN SPECIAL WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 It is hardly possible to walk away from Mikhail Bobrov without feeling that 
you have met a special person. He not only survived the Germans' 900-day, World 
War II siege of Leningrad, in which more than 1 million people died, he was 
among the brave soldiers who made sure the city survived. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobrov, an official with the St. Petersburg Organizing Committee for the 
Goodwill Games, told his story Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A national junior alpine skiing champion and an expert mountain climber, he 
was selected at 17 for a harrowing assignment while on medical leave here -- 
his hometown -- after being wounded at the front. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon learning that the Germans scored direct hits upon Leningrad -- now St. 
Petersburg -- by aiming at the city's magnificent golden domes and spires, the 
Soviet army assigned Bobrov and three other soldiers -- Olga Firsova, Ella 
Prigogeva and Alois Zenbo -- to camouflage them. 
</P>
<P>
 Using gray warship paint and black sails, they completed their first three 
projects in three months. The fourth was the most ambitious, covering the 
120-foot needle spire on the 360-foot Peter and Paul Cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
 They worked by night in the bleakest months of winter, December through 
February, sleeping by day on tombs of former czars inside the Cathedral. They 
were fed the equivalent of one slice of bread, a little macaroni and a little 
grain each day, which they supplemented by eating small birds that they trapped 
and cooked over a fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the end of their ordeal, the army thanked them for their efforts by 
doubling their food rations. It was too late for Prigogeva and Zenbo, who died 
that spring of malnutrition. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, Bobrov had been assigned to the Caucasus Mountains, where the small 
unit of Russians that he commanded came across a small unit of Germans one day 
the next winter. After a brief battle in the snow, all of the Germans had been 
shot. 
</P>
<P>
 While checking for their identities, he discovered that two were still 
breathing. Rigging skis for the wounded men's descent from the mountain, he 
escorted them over harsh terrain to a Russian medical facility, where they 
remained until healthy enough for transfer to a prisoner-of-war camp. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, Bobrov resumed his athletic career, competing in the modern 
pentathlon in the 1952 Summer Olympics. Eight years later, while coaching the 
Russian modern pentathlon team during the 1960 Games at Rome, he kept crossing 
paths with a German rower who looked familiar. The German also seemed to know 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 One day, they sat together in the cafeteria of the athletes' village and 
discussed where they might have met. It was not long before they realized that 
the rower was one of the German soldiers captured in the Caucasus. "You saved 
my life," Otto Bauer told Bobrov. 
</P>
<P>
 They were close friends until Bauer's death five years ago. RANDY HARVEY

RUSSIANS HAVE A GOLDEN EDGE ON HOME ICE; GOODWILL GAMES: AMERICAN TODD ELDREDGE 
CLAIMS SILVER MEDAL IN MEN'S COMPETITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 This city might have difficulty producing ice but not ice skaters. Through the 
Goodwill Games' first two figure skating events, pairs and men's singles, 
skaters who train at the Yubileiny Sports Palace have rewarded their fans with 
four of the six medals, including both golds. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Natalia Mishkutenok and Artur Dmitriev, the Winter Olympic gold 
medalists from 1992 and silver medalists from '94, they swept the first three 
places in pairs. Later Friday night, 1994 Olympic gold medalist Alexei Urmanov 
became the men's champion, ahead of second-place Todd Eldredge of the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 Under other circumstances, one might suspect a home-ice advantage for the 
Russians. But it would hardly be fair to call the Yubileiny ice an advantage 
for anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 After the skaters had waited out a 24-hour delay while rink temperatures 
cooled enough to freeze water, they had few complaints about the ice when the 
competition finally began Thursday night. But by Friday night, the Goodwill 
Games' ice-meisters apparently had overcompensated. The surface, the skaters 
said, was too hard.  
</P>
<P>
 Not that any of them wanted to continue making an issue of it. One who started 
to object, then changed his mind was Urmanov, who said: "I should not have any 
complaints about the quality of the ice because I won the gold." 
</P>
<P>
 Suffering more than the skaters were members of the St. Petersburg Organizing 
Committee. Expecting figure skating to be one of the few sellouts, they have 
found that the schedule change confused potential ticket buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friday afternoon session, which was postponed from Thursday night, drew a 
crowd of about 100 in the 7,000-seat Yubileiny. That perhaps was a 
disappointment for France's Surya Bonaly, who skated well enough to lead after 
the women's technical program, but not for three U.S. women. The fewer 
witnesses there were to their performance, the better -- as Nicole Bobek was 
fifth, Michelle Kwan sixth and Elaine Zayak seventh in a field of eight. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd was bigger Friday night, but Yubileiny remained more than a thousand 
spectators shy of capacity. Judging from their enthusiasm, however, they got 
their rubles' worth, especially in the pairs competition as the Russians 
flaunted their supremacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Finishing behind Mishkutenok and Dmitriev after the freestyle programs were 
second-place Marina Yeltsova and Alexei Bushkov, who finished third in this 
year's World Championships, and third-place Yevgenia Shishkova and Vadim 
Naumov, the reigning world champions. 
</P>
<P>
 The young U.S. team of Stephanie Stiegler and Lance Travis, who train at Lake 
Arrowhead, finished a respectable fifth, one place ahead of their veteran 
teammates, Calla Urbanski and Rocky Marval, who have resumed their partnership 
this year after their second breakup in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Urbanski and Marval were not pleased with the judging, particularly that of 
the United States' Joan Gruber, who placed the two American pairs behind not 
only three of the four Russian teams but also one from Latvia. Gruber was not 
particularly pleased with Urbanski and Marval, pointing out that her scores 
were consistent with those of the other six judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Easily the happiest American was Eldredge. He did not skate well enough in his 
freestyle program to upset Urmanov, but he did edge the 1994 Olympic bronze 
medalist, France's Philippe Candeloro. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, Eldredge was the youngest U.S. champion in 24 years at 18; he 
repeated at 19, started sliding at 20 and appears now to be making his comeback 
at 22. Goodwill Games Notes 
</P>
<P>
 In women's volleyball, Russia swept the United States, 3-0 (15-8, 15-10, 
15-4), to win the gold medal. Japan beat China, 3-1, for the bronze. . . . In 
diving, Dmitri Sautin of Russia won the men's 3-meter springboard. Scott Donie 
was the top U.S. finisher in fifth. . . . In men's gymnastics, Yevgeni Shabayev 
of Russia and China's Chjon Dun shared gold in the parallel bars, Grigori 
Misyutin of Ukraine won the vault and Russia's Aleksei Voropayev the horizontal 
bar. The best U.S. finishers were Scott Keswick, fourth in the vault, and Drew 
Durbin, fourth in the horizontal bar. . . . The yachting competition, postponed 
for two days because of a lack of wind on the Gulf of Filand, was finally 
completed. The lone U.S. medalist was Eric Oetgen with a silver in the Finn 
class.GOODWILL GAMES

 Manager Marcel Lachemann, knowing the Angels needed something drastic to snap 
out of their recent funk, revamped the batting order Friday. The most notable 
change was inserting left fielder Jim Edmonds into the leadoff spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann also dropped right fielder Tim Salmon, who has hit third for most of 
the past two seasons, into the fifth spot. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he could remember the last time he batted leadoff, Edmonds smiled and 
said, "First time." 
</P>
<P>
 First time in the majors? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, first time in baseball," Edmonds said. "First time since pizza league." 
</P>
<P>
 Third baseman Spike Owen and center fielder Chad Curtis, the two primary 
leadoff hitters recently, batted second and third, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to try to do something different," Lachemann said of trying to snap 
a nine-game losing streak at Anaheim Stadium. ELLIOTT TEAFORD

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; 14TH IN A ROW DOESN'T SATISFY MCRAE

 Not even a 14-game winning streak can blind Hal McRae's critical eye. 
</P>
<P>
 "This sounds funny -- but we're not playing as well as we need to play," the 
Kansas City manager said Friday night after an 8-0 victory over the road-weary 
Seattle Mariners at Kansas City. The win extended the second-longest winning 
streak in team history. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're giving away four-five outs every night," McRae said. "We're not turning 
some double plays we need to turn." 
</P>
<P>
 Imperfect though it was, the Royals' 14th consecutive victory represents the 
longest run in the major leagues since Minnesota won 15 in a row in 1991. It's 
only two short of the Royals' 16-game streak in 1977, the longest in the majors 
since 1953. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Gordon (11-6), with his finest outing of the year, pitched eight innings 
of three-hit ball. He struck out five, walked one and retired 14 of his last 15 
batters. Every Royal starter but Felix Jose had at least one hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's safe to say everybody's having a great time," said Mike Magnante, who 
pitched the ninth. "A lot of us can't remember when we had this much fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Griffey Jr. of the Mariners left the game in the fourth inning when he 
bruised the inside of his right knee fouling off a pitch. "We think he'll be 
all right, at least enough to DH," Seattle Manager Lou Piniella said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Royals, 9 1/2 games out of first place in the Central when the streak 
began on July 23, pulled to within one game of Cleveland for the wild-card 
spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners are in the midst of a 32-day, 30-game trip because of ceiling 
problems at the Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 4, Milwaukee 0 -- Ben McDonald pitched a one-hitter, allowing only a 
fourth-inning single by Dave Nilsson as the Orioles won at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a fastball away," McDonald said of Nilsson's hit on a 2-1 pitch. "He 
stuck his bat out and blooped it over the shortstop." 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald (13-7) matched his career high for victories, and also set a season 
high with nine strikeouts. He walked four in his first shutout of the year and 
fifth complete game. It was the second one-hitter of McDonald's career. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 12, Minnesota 3 -- Jimmy Key became baseball's first 17-game winner 
as the Yankees won at Minneapolis for their eighth consecutive victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Stanley drove in four runs, including two with a double in the eight-run 
fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Yankees' 10th consecutive road victory, their longest road winning 
streak since 1962. The Yankees are averaging 6.8 runs in compiling a major 
league-leading 37-17 road record. Key (17-3) is 10-0 away from Yankee Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 4, Detroit 2 -- Juan Guzman won for the sixth time in seven decisions 
as the Blue Jays beat the Tigers at Toronto. Guzman (12-10) overcame a tough 
first two innings in which he threw 54 pitches, giving up three walks and two 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 5, Texas 4 -- Terry Steinbach's infield hit with two outs in the ninth 
inning gave the Athletics a victory over the Rangers at Oakland and ended their 
six-game losing streak.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; STATISTICS BECOME THE HEIGHT OF FOLLY

 There was a time when Brett Butler cared about how tall he isn't, but he says 
never lied about his height. "People said I was too short and too little and 
didn't have enough weight on me (to be a major leaguer), " Butler said. "So 
when they asked me how tall I was, I said around 5 foot 10. Actually, I'm 5-9 
1/2, but the hair makes me 5-10. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, about the 160 pounds. I was just under 160, so I said around 160. I'm 
over (160) now, my weight has vacillated between 157 and 162 the last 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now I don't care what I'm listed at," said Butler, who has played 12 
years in the majors and is making $3.5 million this season. "You can list me at 
5-3 if you want." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Jim Gott, on what he believes is the best explanation of why some baseball 
fans resent players making so much money: "People hate us for that because they 
can relate to us swinging a bat, making the double play or catching a ball, 
because everybody has done it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are talking about a pyramid where there are 750 at the top and it tapers 
all the way down to the population of our whole country and maybe the world. As 
opposed to a tennis player, maybe, where that pyramid is a lot steeper and 
people can't understand how tennis pros can hit those little corners out on the 
tennis court in a three-set match." 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 For the record: The Dodger game on Monday will begin at 2 p.m. PDT. . . . 
There is no game scheduled today because Mile High Stadium is being used for a 
Denver Bronco-Atlanta Falcon game. Pitchers scheduled for the remainder of the 
series are Orel Hershiser (5-6) vs. Greg Harris (3-11) Sunday at 2 p.m. and 
Pedro Astacio (6-8) vs. Marvin Freeman (10-2) on Monday.

 Darren Dreifort has recovered from shoulder tendinitis and is starting again 
for the double-A San Antonio Missions, for whom he has a 2-0 record, 21 
strikeouts and a 1.64 earned-run average in five games and 22 innings. . . . 
During the baseball strike in 1981, Tim Wallach unloaded trucks for Dart 
Trucking, a company owned by former USC baseball coach Rod Dedeaux. "I made $7 
an hour there," said Wallach, who was in his first season with the Montreal 
Expos when the strike hit. "I was making the minimum baseball salary -- I was 
supposed to make $30,000 that year and ended up making $20,000." MARYANN HUDSON

EASLEY IS THE PICTURE OF POWER AS ANGELS WIN, 5-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Predictability took a beating at Anaheim Stadium Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The new, $3.6-million video board went on the fritz for five innings in its 
debut, but all things considered that hardly ranked as the most shocking event 
of the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 There were so many more unexpected events in the Angels' 5-3 victory over the 
Chicago White Sox before 30,274. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel second baseman Damion Easley, batting .211 when the night began, hit two 
home runs in a three-hit night. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago first baseman Frank Thomas went hitless in four plate appearances. He 
did walk once. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel reliever Russ Springer kept the White Sox hitless in 1 1/3 innings to 
earn his second career save. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Angels ended a nine-game home losing streak, winning for only the 
third time in 14 games overall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, baby," Manager Marcel Lachemann said. "A win anywhere is nice, but a win 
here is especially nice." 
</P>
<P>
 Until Easley stepped to the plate in the bottom of the fourth inning Friday, 
the Angels appeared to find their usual rut, playing their distinctive brand of 
listless baseball to the hilt. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago took a 2-0 lead in the fourth on solo home runs by Robin Ventura, in 
the second, and Julio Franco, in the fourth, against starter Chuck Finley 
(9-10). 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels mounted little in the way of offense against starter Wilson Alvarez 
until Easley's two-run homer in the bottom of the fourth made the score 2-2. It 
was Easley's fifth homer this season, but his first since May 10 against Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 By his next at-bat, with the bases empty in the seventh, Chicago had regained 
the lead, 3-2. But Easley hit a 3-and-2 pitch from Alvarez over the left field 
wall, completing the first two-home run game of his career. His three runs 
batted in equaled his personal best. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Edmonds' one-out, run-scoring double gave the Angels a 4-3 lead. It held 
up, preserved by Springer, who extended his streak of scoreless innings to 12 
2/3. That might not sound like much, but it's the longest streak by an Angel 
reliever this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Easley has suffered perhaps the most dismal slide of any of the Angels, 
enduring an eight for 49 skid (.163) in the 15 games he had played before 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, in 36 games since returning from the disabled list after having an 
inflamed right shoulder on June 17, he had batted a punchless .177 (22 for 
124). 
</P>
<P>
 Easley had been slotted to be the every day second baseman when the Angels 
overhauled their infield in early June. But he has shared the position with 
Harold Reynolds and Rex Hudler. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a gifted young athlete," Lachemann said of Easley, a .313 hitter before 
shin surgery ended his 1993 season in August. "I honestly believe he will come 
around." 
</P>
<P>
 Without Easley's contributions, the Angels' frustration seemed as if it would 
continue unabated Friday. When the subject came up again before the game, 
Lachemann said: 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets to the point where it looks like you get something rolling, like when 
we swept Boston (July 18-20), but . . . to play at the level we're playing and 
still be in the race is probably the most frustrating part of this thing." 
</P>
<P>
 With a week left before the expected players' strike, set to begin next 
Friday, and the last-place Angels 7 1/2 games out of first and 20 games below 
.500, it seemed like a moot point.

 Anaheim Stadium's new video scoreboard, billed as the second-largest in North 
America, was supposed to debut Friday. But it didn't work for five 
innings.Finally, it came to life as the sixth inning started. 
</P>
<P>
 An unknown glitch kept the board from showing anything but a purplish hue with 
perhaps a dozen black rectangles scattered about on the screen until the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should be working (Saturday night)," Kevin Uhlich, Angel vice president 
for operations, told reporters. There was no further explanation for the 
malfunction. 
</P>
<P>
 The old board was destroyed during the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. The new 
board cost $3.6 million and measures 30 feet by 40 feet. Only the board in 
Toronto's SkyDome is larger.

 Lachemann also dropped right fielder Tim Salmon, who has batted third for most 
of the past two seasons, into the fifth spot.

 Asked if he could remember the last time he batted leadoff, Edmonds smiled and 
said, "First time." 
</P>
<P>
 First time in the majors? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, first time in baseball," Edmonds said. "First time since pizza league."

 Outfielder Rickey Henderson of the Oakland Athletics denies claims by his 
half-sister that he repeatedly raped her as a youth.In a lawsuit filed Thursday 
in Alameda County Superior Court, Paula Henderson, 31, alleges that the sexual 
assaults started when she was 8 and continued into her teens. The suit alleges

birth to her first child. Rickey Henderson, 35, issued a statement Friday 
calling the allegations "totally untrue."

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; MCGRIFF IN ELITE GROUP AFTER 30TH HOMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fred McGriff became only the ninth player in major league history to hit 30 or 
more homers in seven consecutive seasons and helped the Atlanta Braves pull 
away to a 16-6 victory over the Cincinnati Reds Friday night at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 McGriff's 30th homer, a two-run shot in the sixth inning, helped break the 
game open. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Kelly, Terry Pendleton and Jeff Blauser also homered for the Braves to 
keep alive Tom Glavine's unbeaten streak at Riverfront Stadium, where he is 
12-0 in 13 starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Glavine (13-8) gave up five runs in the first two innings -- two on 
bases-loaded walks. 
</P>
<P>
 McGriff joined Jimmie Foxx (12 consecutive years); Lou Gehrig, Eddie Mathews 
and Mike Schmidt (9); Mickey Mantle (8); Babe Ruth, Hank Aaron and Ralph Kiner 
(7). 
</P>
<P>
 "You always strive for consistency," McGriff said. "Hitting 30 again proves 
you've been consistent over the years. It's awful tough. It's like a big rock 
off my shoulders. Every night, guys know you can hit it out and they try to 
throw it so you can't." 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 12, San Francisco 4 -- Jeff Bagwell set team season records for 
homers, RBIs and extra-base hits in powering the Astros over the Giants at 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagwell homered, doubled and drove in five runs to raise his major-league 
leading total to 112. He broke the Astros' club record of 110 RBIs set by Bob 
Watson in 1977. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagwell, who went three for four, hit his 38th homer in the fifth inning to 
surpass Jimmy Wynn's club mark set in 1967. He doubled in the third inning and 
now has 71 extra-base hits this season, moving him past Wynn (1967) and Cesar 
Cedeno (1972) on the club's list. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Swindell (8-8) gave up four runs -- one earned -- and 11 hits in his 
first complete game this season. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 10, Florida 7 -- Bret Saberhagen won his sixth consecutive game as 
Mets beat the Marlins at New York for their third win in a row and eighth in 10 
games. They are now within one game of .500 (53-54) for the first time since 
June 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Saberhagen (13-4) scattered eight hits in seven innings for his seventh 
victory in his last eight decisions. Saberhagen, who retired the first 10 
batters, has a 1.54 ERA in his last eight starts and has raised his strikeout 
total to 137 with just 12 walks, for a ratio of 11.4 strikeouts for every walk. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 5, Philadelphia 0 -- Pedro Martinez allowed only two hits -- both 
singles -- and struck out eight in eight innings at Philadelphia to get his 
fourth consecutive victory and the Expos' 15th in 17 games. Martinez (10-5) set 
up the Phillies all night with hard fastballs, then had them overswinging when 
he followed up with breaking pitches. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 4, Chicago 2 -- Scott Sanders allowed one hit in eight innings for 
the Padres at Chicago and Eddie Williams and Bip Roberts hit solo homers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Gwynn went two for five and has hit safely in 21 of his last 25 games on 
a .408 pace (40 for 98). He leads the major leagues with a .390 average. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 11, Pittsburgh 3 -- Luis Alicea's three-run double off the 
first-base bag capped a two-out, five-run fourth inning as the Cardinals won at 
Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals had 17 hits and drew 12 walks off four Pirate pitchers, while 
stranding 17 runners -- one short of the NL record for a nine-inning game. 
</P>
<P>
 Alicea was four for four with three doubles and Todd Zeile drove in two runs 
for the Cardinals.

IDAHO SNEAKS UP, HALTS DUKES' TITLE MARCH; TENNIS: NEWPORT BEACH FALLS IN WTT 
PLAYOFFS, 25-16, AFTER BEING UNDEFEATED DURING THE REGULAR SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Dukes owner Fred Lieberman, Mr. Superstitious, didn't bother coming to the 
World TeamTennis semifinals, figuring he'd jinx his undefeated team. 
</P>
<P>
 Lieberman, who was at the Dukes' last two losses in the WTT finals, is lucky 
he stayed at home. He wouldn't have wanted to witness what went on Friday night 
at the Gold River Racquet Club. The Idaho Sneakers, who lost six of their first 
eight matches, played perfectly and blew away the Dukes, 25-16, before 1,600 
fans, most of whom were cheering for Idaho. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came in here pretty confident, but my players tried too hard," Dukes Coach 
Angel Lopez said. "It's too bad we played our worst match in the playoffs. It's 
too bad we couldn't have gotten rid of this in the regular season." 
</P>
<P>
 The regular season was almost too easy for the Dukes, who only had two matches 
closer than four points. But from the beginning, the Dukes (14-1) knew Friday's 
match would not be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Zina Garrison Jackson and Larisa Neiland, the league's top women's doubles 
team, were soundly beaten by Manon Bollegraf and Amy Frazier, 6-2. Garrison 
came back to give the Dukes a short-lived lead with a 6-1 victory over Frazier. 
</P>
<P>
 But the match started to turn when Jon and Rick Leach from Laguna Beach upset 
Kelly Jones and Trevor Kronemann, the third ranked men's doubles team, 6-4. The 
Leach brothers lost their first eight sets this season, but have won eight of 
their last nine. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Leach, who helped lead USC to the NCAA championship two months ago, gave 
an indication of how he would play in singles against Kelly Jones, the WTT's 
male MVP, by holding his serve three times in the doubles set. 
</P>
<P>
 Leach, who had lost to Jones twice in the regular season, then proceeded to 
destroy the top men's singles player in team tennis, 6-2. He served four aces 
in the set and never let Jones get going. Meanwhile, brother Rick and father 
Dick, sat proudly on the Idaho bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the best set of tennis I've ever seen Jon play," Rick said. "To beat 
the No. 1 guy in the league like that is a shock." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Dick Leach, the USC men's tennis coach: "That's the best I've seen him 
serve in singles and doubles since he went to the Roscoe Tanner quick serve two 
years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Leach, who lost seven of his first eight singles sets this season, said he 
wasn't even thinking about beating Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just hoping I could keep the match close going into mixed doubles," he 
said. "But potentially, I can hold my serve at love every game when I'm going 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 Leach held his serve twice and then broke Jones to go up 3-1. He held his next 
two service games and then broke Jones again to end the set and give Idaho 
(10-6) a 19-14 lead heading into mixed doubles. A disgusted Jones threw his 
racket into the bench after the set. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt for him," Leach said. "Playing for USC, we were the No. 1 seeds for 
four straight years. I know what it's like to play under pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 The pressure didn't seem to help Kronemann and Neiland either. The league's 
top mixed doubles team was off its game and was routed by Bollegraf and Rick 
Leach, 6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can you say," Kronemann said. "They played great and we were flat. When 
they were 2-6, I wondered what was going on. They have way too much talent to 
be 2-6." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Lieberman knew something.

SPRINGER PROVIDES RELIEF FOR ANGELS' AILING BULLPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While former closer Joe Grahe is talking about becoming a starter again and 
current closer Mark Leiter is lamenting a blown save Thursday night, Russ 
Springer is quietly becoming the Angels' most effective relief pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night, Springer held the Chicago White Sox at bay for 1 1/3 innings 
during the Angels' 5-3 victory to pick up the first Angel save at Anaheim 
Stadium since he earned one July 20 against the Red Sox. That was also the last 
time the Angels won at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wow, I didn't realize it had been that long," Springer said. "I knew it had 
been quite awhile, but that's a long time ago. It's great to win one, though, 
and look at all those smiling faces. Even the postgame spread tastes better 
after a win." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels have been on a steady diet of losses here, thanks primarily to a 
wealth of poor pitching. But Springer, who owns the longest scoreless streak by 
an Angel reliever this season (12 2/3 innings), has been the pleasant exception 
to the rule. In 11 relief appearances, Springer is 1-0 with two saves and a 
1.53 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been really good out of the bullpen," Manager Marcel Lachemann said. 
"When you're coming out of the pen, you don't have to worry about going through 
the lineup a couple of times, you don't have to set things up or worry about 
finesse. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a good arm and he can just get after it." 
</P>
<P>
 Springer was recalled from Vancouver -- where he was 7-4 with a 3.04 ERA as a 
starter -- June 9 and made five starts for the Angels, compiling a 1-2 mark 
with a bloated 7.40 ERA. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angel coaching staff had been trying to get Springer to come over the top 
more with his delivery, but when Lachemann told Springer he was removing him 
from the starting rotation, he also told him he could return to his 
three-quarter delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really wasn't that disappointed because of the combination of the two 
things," Springer said. "And now I feel really comfortable down there. I like 
coming to the park and putting on my spikes every day, knowing I might get into 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I also think I'm pitching better because I don't get rusty. I've either 
been up throwing or in five of the last seven games and I just have a feel for 
the (mound)." 
</P>
<P>
 Springer was clearly in the groove Friday night. He relieved starter Chuck 
Finley with Julio Franco on first and two out in the eighth inning and got 
Darrin Jackson to pop out to center. 
</P>
<P>
 Lance Johnson, leading off the ninth, reached first on a throwing error by 
third baseman Spike Owen. But Springer maintained his composure, striking out 
pinch hitters Joey Cora and Ozzie Guillen. He walked pinch hitter Warren 
Newson, but the game ended when Tim Raines flied to left. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the mentality of being able to go in and just let it fly," Springer 
said. "You don't have to hold anything back and that suits me." 
</P>
<P>
 If it suits Springer, it also suits the Angels. After all, they've often come 
up short when it comes to short relief.

 Jim Everett completed only four of 10 passes for 35 yards and was intercepted 
once on a badly overthrown ball as the New Orleans Saints lost to the New 
England Patriots, 24-6, in an exhibition game on a rainy Friday night in 
Foxboro, Mass. Everett, who was traded by the Rams this spring, was also sacked 
twice. He started and played until midway through the second quarter, was also 
sacked twice. New England's top draft choice, USC linebacker Willie McGinest, 
had three sacks before being sidelined in the second half with a right 
hamstring strain. . . . Scott Mitchell completed 10 of 19 passes for 123 yards 
and a touchdown in his debut as the Detroit Lions' quarterback in a 26-13 
victory over the New York Jets at Pontiac, Mich. The loss spoiled the debut of 
Jet Coach Pete Carroll. Jet quarterback Boomer Esiason was intercepted twice 
and completed only five of nine passes for 36 yards before being replaced by 
Jack Trudeau in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie running back Marshall Faulk from San Diego State rushed 15 times for 38 
yards and set up two first-half field goals in the Indianapolis Colts' 13-9 
victory over the Seattle Seahawks at Indianapolis. Faulk, the second player 
taken in the NFL draft, sat out the second half. Six of Faulk's carries were 
for first downs, including a 12-yard run that took Indianapolis to the 
Seahawks' seven late in the first quarter. Leonard Humphries returned a pass 
interception 52 yards for a touchdown in the fourth quarter for the Colts. . . 
. Newcomers Erik Kramer and Merril Hoge hooked up on an early 13-yard touchdown 
pass play as the Bears beat the Philadelphia Eagles, 12-6, at Chicago. Kramer 
was nine of 17 for 79 yards while playing most of the first half before giving 
way to Steve Walsh. . . . Defensive lineman Clyde Simmons, who played for new 
Phoenix Coach Buddy Ryan in Philadelphia, had two interceptions and returned 
one for a touchdown in the Cardinals' 17-7 victory over the San Francisco 49ers 
at Phoenix. The Cardinals had four interceptions in the game played in 
102-degree temperatures and wind gusts of up to 32 m.p.h. Steve Young played 
the first quarter for the 49ers and completed six of nine passes for 63 yards 
before giving way to Elvis Grbac, who completed 14 of 23 passes for 117 yards. 
Cardinal starter Steve Beuerlein was five of eight for 71 yards and Jim McMahon 
was eight of nine for 70 yards.

 Unrestricted free agent Tony Casillas said he hopes to return to the defending 
Super Bowl champion Dallas Cowboys, now led by his old college coach, Barry 
Switzer. 
</P>
<P>
 The defensive lineman, whose contract was terminated by the Kansas City Chiefs 
for failing to report to training camp, said he has overcome medical problems 
and plans to play this season. He was being treated for hypertension and 
declined to report to Kansas City. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm fine to play football," he was quoted as saying by the Dallas Morning 
News. "I'm looking for somebody to play for. I'll definitely play this season, 
and you'd have to be stupid not to play for Dallas if you had the opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Casillas was diagnosed with borderline hypertension and has been on medication 
since he was treated by an internist and cardiologist, according to a statement 
from his agent, Tom Condon. "We understand the reasons the Chiefs could not 
wait for Tony to make a full recovery and why they gave him his release," 
Condon said. "As a result, he returned his signing bonus, and now is an 
unrestricted free agent."

SURFING; MACHADO'S WAITING GAME BACKFIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Competing on a moving surface, surfers have to accept what the ocean gives 
them. And some days, it gives nothing. Ask Rob Machado. 
</P>
<P>
 Winner of the Op Pro at Huntington Beach Pier last Sunday, Machado did not 
catch the waves he needed at the same spot Friday in the third round of the 
U.S. Open of Surfing, losing to Jeff Deffenbaugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Machado, of Cardiff, surfs regularly on the world championship tour and was 
seeded fourth in the U.S. Open. Deffenbaugh, of Huntington Beach, earned a 
wild-card invitation to the Op Pro. 
</P>
<P>
 Paddling out in 3- to 5-foot surf before noon, Deffenbaugh caught the first 
wave of the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Machado waited longer for better waves that never came. When he did take off, 
he showed his power and quickness, but also fell three times. 
</P>
<P>
 Deffenbaugh once scored a 7.33. and three times scored in the five-point 
range. In the final minutes, Machado needed a 5.42 to catch him. Machado caught 
a wave in the final 10 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could easily have pulled it off," Deffenbaugh said. "He's done it many 
times." 
</P>
<P>
 But this time, even Machado could not execute the needed maneuvers on the 
small wave. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Slater, the 1992 world champion, dazzled the crowd with vertical 
maneuvers, tail slides and slashing turns. His total score of 31.50 was the 
highest of the day.

 The Minnesota Timberwolves announced the team is being sold to businessman 
Glen Taylor, a former state senator. The sale, for an unspecified amount, is 
pending NBA approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The team was first sold last spring to a Louisiana group that planned to move 
the club to New Orleans. But the league refused to approve the deal and 
expressed hope for a buyer who would keep the team in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, 53, served 10 years in the Minnesota Senate, resigning his office in 
1990 to concentrate on his printing and graphics companies. Taylor's wealth is 
estimated at $400 million.

 Toni Kukoc said he has agreed to a six-year, $26-million deal with the Chicago 
Bulls that will make him the highest-paid player in the club's history. Michael 
Jordan was paid $3.9 million for the 1992-93 season, but made a reported $32

 The prosecutor in the assault and battery case against former Laker Michael 
Cooper said there's a good chance the case will be settled without a trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper, now an assistant coach with the Lakers, was arrested July 27 in 
Corrales, N.M., for assault and battery on his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Corrales prosecutor Michelle Frechette said entering counseling probably would 
be a factor in Cooper's favor. Cooper began inpatient therapy Thursday, 
according to his attorney, Joe Lang.

 The Phoenix Suns and forward A.C. Green have sued the NBA over the league's 
invalidation of Green's contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The league rejected the contracts of Green and the Bulls' Horace Grant, who 
had signed with the Orlando Magic, saying the deals were designed to circumvent 
the salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Green signed as a free agent before last season, then exercised his escape 
clause after the season and re-signed with the Suns for five years at about $26 
million.

 The city of Tacoma and the Seattle SuperSonics have agreed on a contract for 
the team to play next season's home games in the Tacoma Dome. The SuperSonics 
will play in Tacoma, 30 miles south of Seattle, while the Seattle Coliseum is 
rebuilt at a cost of $74 million. It is expected to be ready for the 1995-96 
season.

 Kevin Gogan is going back home. Back to where his professional life began. 
Back to Texas Stadium. Back on the field with the Dallas Cowboys.But when Gogan 
emerges on that field Sunday night for an exhibition game, it'll be from 
another entrance in another uniform as a member of the Raiders and the 
315-pound right guard admits it'll be strange.

down and out. Or maybe they'll knock me down and out, but it'll be fun."

SIX TRAINERS HAVE THREE DAYS OF HEARINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The popular image of a trainer at Del Mar is someone on a seven-week paid 
vacation, with one foot in the Pacific Ocean and one hand on a stopwatch. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a misconception, of course. Del Mar is far more pleasant than Aqueduct in 
the winter, or Thistledown any time, but it's still a six-day racing week, one 
more than average on the Southern California circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 For a half-dozen trainers at the seaside track, this season has been more than 
that. They will remember the current meeting not for the races they won, but 
for the hearings they have attended and the testimony they have heard and 
given. 
</P>
<P>
 To a man, the Del Mar Six say not guilty to charges that they knowingly raced 
horses that tested positive for a prohibited medication at Santa Anita last 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saddled my first horse in 1938," trainer Willard Proctor said. "This is the 
first positive I've ever had." 
</P>
<P>
 Proctor's attorney is Donald Calabria, who also represents Ron McAnally, 
Richard Mandella and Mark Hennig. The other trainers, Bill Shoemaker and Looie 
Cenicola, have their own attorneys, and yet another lawyer, Richard Craigo, is 
representing the owners of horses trained by Hennig and Mandella. 
</P>
<P>
 The trainers are fighting to avoid suspensions and/or fines and trying to keep 
hard-earned reputations untarnished. McAnally is in the Racing Hall of Fame. 
Proctor has been nominated for a spot on the Hall's ballot several times. 
Shoemaker is in the Hall as a jockey with a record 8,833 winners. Mandella won 
two Breeders' Cup races and two other stakes on the same day at Santa Anita 
last fall, and trained 1993 horse of the year Kotashaan. In his first full year 
as a trainer in 1993, Hennig trained horses that earned $4.1 million. Cenicola 
has won more than a dozen stakes since forming his own stable. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug in question is scopolamine, which has been described as a depressant. 
Calabria has suggested that contamination is the cause; scopolamine grows 
naturally in several plants, including jimsonweed, and the attorney has 
produced witnesses from the post-race testing barn who have said they saw 
jimsonweed in horses' straw. 
</P>
<P>
 More hearings are scheduled for Sept. 3-5 at Del Mar.

DESPITE VICTORY, GRAF IS UNHAPPY 
</P>

 Steffi Graf rebounded from a second-set tiebreaker loss to defeat France's 
Julie Halard in the third set and win her quarterfinal match, 6-4, 6-7 (8-6), 
6-0 in the $400,000 Toshiba Classic on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-ranked Graf was extended through the first two sets before dominating 
Halard in the final set at the La Costa Resort and Spa. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't say I'm very pleased with the way I'm playing," Graf said. "Things 
went better in the third set, but it was because she got tired. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I'm closing out matches very well. . . . I just don't feel 100% 
on the court." 
</P>
<P>
 The tiebreaker loss for Graf was the second set she has dropped here. Graf 
lost the first set Wednesday to Lisa Raymond before winning 6-7, (10-8), 6-2, 
6-2. 
</P>
<P>
 In another quarterfinal match, second-seeded Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain 
needed only 51 minutes to defeat Germany's Christina Singer, 6-0, 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixth-seeded Lindsay Davenport defaulted from her match against Tami 
Whitlinger-Jones of Henderson, Nev., because of a strained left calf. 
</P>
<P>
 In today's semifinals, Graf will face Whitlinger-Jones and Sanchez Vicario 
will play her Federation Cup doubles partner, Conchita Martinez. Martinez beat 
Jana Novotna of the Czech Republic 6-1, 6-2. Sanchez Vicario holds a 5-2 career 
edge over Martinez.

CARDIFF'S MACHADO FAILS TO ROLL WITH BAD BREAKS AT U.S. OPEN; SURFING: WAVES 
FAVOR HUNTINGTON BEACH'S DEFFENBAUGH, WHO BEATS OP PRO CHAMPION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODY BERGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Competing on a moving playing field, surfers have to accept what the ocean 
gives them. And some days, it gives nothing. Ask Rob Machado. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of the Op Pro at Huntington Beach Pier last Sunday, Machado did not 
catch the waves he needed at the same spot Friday. He lost to Jeff Deffenbaugh 
in Round 3 of the U.S. Open of Surfing. 
</P>
<P>
 Machado, who lives in Cardiff, surfs regularly on the world championship tour 
and was seeded fourth in the U.S. Open. Deffenbaugh, from Huntington Beach, 
earned a wild-card berth in the Op Pro. 
</P>
<P>
 Paddling out in 3 to 5 foot surf before noon, Deffenbaugh caught the first 
wave of the heat. He threw a couple cutbacks and worked it almost all the way 
to the sand, scoring a 5.63. The second, smaller wave was also his. 
</P>
<P>
 Machado took off on a small one and fell. But he showed why he was the heavy 
favorite on his second effort. A long, left-breaking wave earned Machado a 
7.33. 
</P>
<P>
 But the advantage may have gone to Deffenbaugh, who knew he had nothing to 
lose. While Machado waited for bigger, more powerful waves, Deffenbaugh took 
off on anything that looked fun. With three minutes to go, Machado needed a 
5.42 to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Deffenbaugh paddled around the priority buoy and moved in close to Machado. 
They waited. 
</P>
<P>
 With a minute left, both surfers paddled into an oncoming wave. Neither took 
off. But in paddling for it, Deffenbaugh lost his priority and had to hope the 
clock would run out before Machado caught a wave. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't, but the wave was too small for Machado to do much with and the 5.0 
he scored was not enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were no waves. That's the worst thing that can happen to you in a 
contest," Machado said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deffenbaugh competes in qualifying-series events, which run four-person heats 
and do not use the priority buoys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been watching the other heats and the strategy of other competitors," 
Deffenbaugh said. The Orange County native also knew the tides and wave 
directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Deffenbaugh and Richie Collins are the only remaining wild cards. Newport 
Beach's Richie Collins defeated Gary Elkerton, of Australia, in the first heat 
of the day at 6 a.m. Tom Curren lost to Dave Macaulay, the No. 2 surfer in the 
world. Shane Stoneman, from Capistrano Beach, lost to Kelly Slater, who is No. 
1. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoneman opened the heat with an exciting, long ride. When Slater heard the 
announcers call the seven-point score, he got busy. His first was an 8. 
Speeding through a series of maneuvers on each wave, Slater built his margin of 
victory with every wave. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I heard I was having a good heat, I figured I might as well have a 
really good heat," he said. In the end, he scored a total of 31.50, the highest 
of the day and the highest of the contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Longboarder Joel Tudor scored the highest wave of the day, though, when a 
perfectly stylish barrel-ride earned him a 10 in the quarterfinals. Notes 
</P>
<P>

 And, until his death, the home screen served as a constant reflection of his 
roller-coaster career, from the scandal of Watergate -- which forced his 
resignation from the presidency 20 years ago this month -- to his achievements 
on the international scene. Finally, there were his appearances on TV in the 
last two decades in connection with an outpouring of books as he sought to lift 
his place in history from the disaster that dragged it down. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, a current outpouring of memoirs about Nixon and Watergate, timed to the 
20th anniversary of his resignation, seem fittingly in place on TV -- where so 
much of it happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the multipart efforts -- a Disney Channel rerun of David Frost's 
historic 1977 interview with Nixon and a Discovery Channel series that begins 
Sunday, "Watergate" -- make for mesmerizing viewing, not only for the content 
but also as a study of this complex figure who careened from the penthouse to 
the basement and tried to bounce back up. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Aside from the historical events themselves, what is fascinating in a TV sense 
is the evolution of Nixon on the medium that almost did him in during the 1960 
presidential debates with John F. Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who saw Nixon in those debates, then watched the Frost interviews 17 
years later -- and also viewed Brian Lamb's more recent discussion with the 
former President on C-SPAN's "Booknotes" series -- could not help notice the 
startling and riveting TV presence that this enigmatic politician had 
developed. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever one thought of him, or thinks of him, he was, in the latter years of 
his life, perhaps the most compelling TV figure imaginable, bringing with him 
the baggage of an incomparably volatile and checkered career. I saw the 
"Booknotes" interview twice and could not turn it off; it was utterly hypnotic. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, shortly before George Bush was to be sworn in as President, Nixon 
wrote an article for TV Guide, offering thoughts on dealing with broadcasters 
from the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of all the institutions arrayed with and against a President, none controls 
his fate more than television," Nixon wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the natural adversarial relationship of a President and the media, he added 
a flurry of comments: TV reporters, he said, in many ways "are political actors 
just like the President, mindful of their ratings, careful of preserving and 
building their power." The media, he wrote, "have to be outfoxed, outflanked 
and outperformed." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes Nixon succeeded in this plan, sometimes he didn't, and most of it 
was right there on TV for us to see. 
</P>
<P>
 At the start of his career, TV simply didn't have the clout it soon would 
develop, so his successful congressional campaigns against Jerry Voorhis and 
Helen Gahagan Douglas, which earned him the hatred of critics for 
"red-baiting," had -- despite considerable public impact -- less national 
television penetration than would have occurred, say, a decade later. But the 
Alger Hiss case brought him fame -- and more enemies -- and he became a member 
of the House Committee on Un-American Activities. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in 1952, with his famous "Checkers" speech on television, that Nixon 
came to grips with the new medium in an appearance whose political lessons 
still reverberate. 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon had been chosen by Dwight D. Eisenhower as his vice presidential running 
mate. But Nixon was almost done in by a disclosure that California backers had 
added to his U.S. Senate salary with an $18,000 slush fund. He decided to fight 
-- on TV, where he could appeal directly to voters without questioning, a 
technique that now has become standard practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics and detractors scoffed at what they considered a cornball appearance 
in which he described himself -- with his wife, Pat, sitting by -- as just a 
plain guy. But, as Harry Castleman and Walter J. Podrazik wrote in their book 
"Watching TV": 
</P>
<P>
 "Nixon's presentation that night demonstrated that he was one of the first 
major politicians to grasp fully the impact and nature of television as a 
political tool. . . . The Horatio Alger story culminated in the ultimate 
heart-tug, a little dog (named Checkers)." 
</P>
<P>
 Nixon told viewers that a man from Texas had sent his family the animal, 
adding: "You know, the kids love the dog, and I just want to say this right 
now, that regardless of what they say about it, we're gonna keep it." 
</P>
<P>
 The performance went over with the public, and Eisenhower and Nixon were 
elected. 
</P>
<P>
 They were re-elected in 1956. In 1959, Nixon, increasingly involved in foreign 
policy, engaged in another incident that gained wide TV attention, his "kitchen 
debate" with Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 TV, however, turned sour for Nixon in 1960 when he went up against a more 
sophisticated media contender -- Kennedy, still regarded as the best-ever 
politician on the home medium -- in their debates for the presidency. Nixon was 
good enough to win on radio, where many regarded him as the victor, but he was 
no match for Kennedy on TV, who moved into the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Things became worse for Nixon politically in 1962 when he then lost in the 
California gubernatorial race to Edmund G. (Pat) Brown. It was in conceding 
that race that Nixon made a statement heard often on television in the years to 
come, telling reporters: "You won't have Nixon to kick around anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 In late 1962, when it seemed that Nixon might be all washed up in politics, 
another controversial TV event occurred in which he again was the centerpiece. 
It was an ABC program by news commentator Howard K. Smith titled "The Political 
Obituary of Richard Nixon." 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out to be a premature burial. By 1968 -- the year in which Robert F. 
Kennedy and the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. were assassinated and violence 
erupted between police and anti-Vietnam War protesters outside the Democratic 
convention in Chicago, for all the world to see on TV -- Nixon was elected 
President. 
</P>
<P>
 He would be elected still again in 1972 in the term that was cut short two 
years later by his resignation in the face of impeachment over Watergate. 
</P>
<P>
 In his comeback years, he had learned to play TV to his advantage when 
possible, even on entertainment shows. He played the piano on "The Jack Paar 
Program," and he even turned up on "Laugh-In," uttering one of the series' 
trademark lines: "Sock it to me." 
</P>
<P>
 But as President again, his adversarial relationship with TV came to the fore 
once more. He was at serious odds with public television. And, amid the Vietnam 
War and TV's influential coverage, his vice president, Spiro T. Agnew, put 
pressure on CBS, NBC and ABC, depicting them as part of an elitist Eastern 
Establishment that was disseminating its views in its news reporting. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a successful campaign for a while. But, within several years, Watergate 
began to emerge. And in 1973, Agnew -- who once struck fear in the TV networks 
-- resigned from office under investigation for graft, to be replaced by Gerald 
R. Ford. 
</P>
<P>
 The Watergate debacle began in 1972, a year in which Nixon had already scored 
an international triumph by opening the door to the People's Republic of China 
-- impressively recorded by TV -- and then traveled to Moscow for a summit 
meeting. In June of that year, five men were arrested for breaking into the 
Democratic National Committee's offices at the Watergate complex in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Nixon was re-elected in a landslide in November, by the next year a 
congressional committee, headed by Sen. Sam Ervin (D-N.C.), had begun televised 
hearings into the Watergate affair. 
</P>
<P>
 In August of 1974, Nixon resigned in a televised address. Thus began his 
attempt at the long road back. The current spate of programs such as the Frost 
interview and "Watergate" vividly document the unprecedented and mind-boggling 
passage in American history -- and its legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 And, combined with Nixon's later, rare home-screen appearances, they give us a 
close-up look at the unfailingly revealing clues to one of the most astonishing 
figures TV has ever recorded. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Watergate" premieres on cable's Discovery Channel with a two-hour 
installment at 9 p.m. Sunday, followed by one-hour segments Monday through 
Wednesday at 10 p.m. All five hours will be shown again Aug. 14 at noon. "The 
Nixon Interviews With David Frost" -- with new footage added to the old 
programs -- airs Tuesdays at 9 p.m. through August on cable's Disney Channel. 
Arts & Entertainment will rebroadcast a special, "The Key to Watergate," at 8 
p.m. Monday.

POP BEAT: THE SOUNDS OF DISTORTION ARE STEREOLAB'S MUZAK; THE LONDON GROUP'S 
EASY-LISTENING MUSIC IS FOR PEOPLE REARED ON SONIC YOUTH. WHAT THE BAND'S 
CREATED IS ESCAPISM WITH FLAIR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The London-based band Stereolab mixes Muzak (the kind that hipper dentists of 
the mid-'60s drilled teeth to) with organ-powered cocktail music (the kind Dean 
Martin scored with) and humming guitar distortion (the kind Pavement loves) and 
comes up with easy-listening music for a generation raised on Sonic Youth. 
</P>
<P>
 The quintet's abstract blend may seem strictly for kitsch value at first, but 
it's got a substance all its own. Stereolab, like other current bands that draw 
from lounge music (e.g. Combustible Edison) or techno's ambient deejays who 
draw from Muzak (e.g. Orbital), creates escapism with flair. It's a break from 
the reality-based rock and rap of today, without the nauseating mediocrity of 
rock lite. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern-day mutations of Muzak and lounge tunes, two very David Lynchian 
genres, are quirky and surreal enough to spare rock's more discriminating 
listeners the embarrassment of being caught listening to grandma music. The 
recent experimentation also gives the feel of discovering something incredibly 
new and out of this world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like music made for utilitarian reasons, like elevator music," says 
Stereolab's co-founder and guitarist Tim Gane. "You can take it out of its 
original purpose, then it's just strange and very avant-garde. It's like an odd 
little art world, but the people who made that music didn't think it was 
strange at the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Those people were Martin Denny, Arthur Lyman, et al. -- arrangers whose 
wonderfully cheesy music has come to be known by the term exotica . Along with 
other forms of martini-sipping music, it's become an inspiration for a new 
bunch of bands that includes L.A.'s Love Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 "Space Age bachelor-pad music," says Stereolab's Gane, tracing the group's 
influences, "was made for bachelors of the '50s and early '60s when they got 
their spanking new hi-fis to entertain with. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was background music, but because stereo had just come out, it was extreme 
and over-emphasized in the sense of effects. Later, that turned into the use of 
strange instruments like Moogs in the late '60s, then peculiar, easy-listening 
music later." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have our own interpretations of exotica, though," says singer and organist 
Laetitia Sadier, who started Stereolab four years ago with Gane. "Like we did 
an album called 'Space Age Bachelor Pad Music,' which revolved around the 
smooth schmooze of the '50s, but it was our own mutation of it. It's actually 
Stereolab's sound." 
</P>
<P>
 The band's fourth album, the new "Mars Audiac Quintet," expands on that theme, 
taking it to more surreal lengths with three organs, tambourines and dream-like 
harmonies by Sadier and second vocalist Mary Hansen.  
</P>
<P>
 "A third of our songs are based around a one-chord drone, on top of which you 
have melodic singing," says Sadier. "It's like putting two contraries 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 The band's organ sound is as fab as fab gets, reminiscent of the music piping 
through ice-skating rinks and malls 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't look for that particular sound, we kind of stumbled on it," says 
Sadier, who will appear with the band at the Troubadour on Aug. 26. "We 
happened to find this Farfisa organ, a great big plastic thing from the '70s, 
in a thrift shop. I just got paid from giving some French lessons to people, so 
we bought it. This incredible, heavy, compressed and loaded sound was like a 
huge shaver -- Whaaah! That's just something you can't premeditate." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes people think it's quite corny," admits Gane. "To me it's quite 
natural though. I never think we're kitsch. We're just going for sounds we 
like. I think we're as modern as any modern-day band."

MARIE OSMOND TAKES A ROLE THAT'S 'MUSIC' TO HER EARS; THEATER: THE COUNTRY 
SINGER ADDS SHOW TUNES TO HER REPERTOIRE, PLAYING MARIA IN THE CLASSIC RODGERS 
AND HAMMERSTEIN MUSICAL THAT ARRIVES TUESDAY AT THE PANTAGES. 
</P>

<P>
 Marie Osmond has always been a little bit country. Now she's a little bit 
Rodgers and Hammerstein. 
</P>
<P>
 Osmond, who starred with brother Donny in ABC-TV's kitschy '70s 
musical-variety series "Donny and Marie," has been touring the country in "The 
Sound of Music" since November. The classic Richard Rodgers and Oscar 
Hammerstein musical about the Von Trapp Family Singers arrives Tuesday at 
Hollywood's Pantages Theatre for a two-week engagement, directed by Oscar's son 
James. 
</P>
<P>
 The 34-year-old Osmond stars as the perky novice-turned-governess Maria who 
wins the hearts of the motherless Von Trapp children and the hand of their 
father, Captain Von Trapp (Laurence Guittard). Mary Martin originated the role 
of Maria on Broadway in 1959; Julie Andrews starred in the 1965 Oscar-winning 
film version. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sound of Music" has become a family affair for Osmond. The eldest of her four 
children, 10-year-old Stephen, plays Kurt Von Trapp. "He asked to audition," 
Osmond says firmly. "They wanted him. He got it because he earned it." 
</P>
<P>
 Osmond has just signed on to continue the tour for another eight months. "I 
think I'm crazy," Osmond says, laughing. "But the producers of 'Sound of Music' 
are really the best to work for. They take great care of you and make life on 
the road pleasant. So it has been a wonderful experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in black jeans and a black jacket, the devout Mormon is holding court 
in her penthouse suite at the Sheraton Universal. Two publicists for the 
musical and Osmond's manager observe the proceedings. Osmond is friendly, 
direct and interview savvy, as well she should be after 31 years in show 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 Osmond made her TV debut at age 3 on Andy Williams' NBC variety series. Her 
older brothers were recurring regulars on his show. She scored her first 
country hit, "Paper Roses," at 13, and still has a thriving country music 
career. Before "Sound of Music," Osmond performed approximately 250 concerts a 
year. Her latest single, "What Kind of Man Walks on a Woman," is due for 
release later this month. Osmond also has her own line of fine, porcelain 
collector dolls, which are distributed on the QVC shopping channel and at the 
Disney theme parks, and she's co-founder of the successful annual telethon, the 
Children's Miracle Network. 
</P>
<P>
 Osmond's children and second husband, music producer Brian Blosil, are 
accompanying her on this tour. "Everything we want in life is not easy," she 
says of juggling career and family. "The good part about it is that I work at 
night. It's not like I am gone all day from my children. It's a wonderful 
experience for them." 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to fit "Sound of Music" into her schedule was difficult for Osmond 
because she was booked to do concerts nearly a year in advance. "The producers 
actually approached me on this and asked me as I was finishing up a big 
Christmas tour in '92. We didn't work it out until November of '93," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Performing such Rodgers and Hammerstein tunes as "The Sound of Music" and "My 
Favorite Things," she acknowledges, is vastly different than singing country. 
"The head tones, the round sounds. . . . You can't phrase too much. When we 
started, I said, 'I don't want to step into it as Marie Osmond.' If you sing 
Rodgers and Hammerstein, you really have to do it justice. It is this whole 
different stylization. I worked with some people on it. It has been really 
interesting to find another voice." 
</P>
<P>
 Osmond doesn't see any similarities between her performing family and the Von 
Trapps. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were actually dysfunctional," she says of the Von Trapps. "The Captain 
never spoke to them. His wife had died. He made them march. Maria brought a 
purpose back in all of their lives. I'd say there are similarities between 
Maria's and my character in a sense that I'm a very positive person. I don't 
think you are born that way. I think you choose to be that way. We are all 
dished out the same amount of garbage. One of my favorite sayings is: 'Tragedy 
plus timing equals humor, so you might as well laugh.' " 
</P>
<P>
 When asked whether she had a normal childhood, Osmond says she honestly can't 
answer the question. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have anything to compare it to. Was my life like my other friends'? 
No. But we did have the same kind of challenges. Sometimes, I think mine were 
on an even grander scale. Did it affect me as much as it did them? Probably. I 
had to grow up on national TV." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, she laughs off her squeaky-clean image. "People perceive Marie 
Osmond as naive, a goody-goody," she acknowledges. "'They have the teeth jokes. 
That's all fine, but if they believe I'm naive, they are very naive. You cannot 
grow up in this business and see the things I have seen. I have seen 
everything. I sat and watched friends of mine, and I could tell you names of 
people you would know that threw their lives and careers away because of 
excessive behavior. I had a great family. I didn't get caught up in that. Not 
that we don't all have pressures -- you learn to deal with them. I'm still here 
and I'm still young."

NOT ALL 'OUR GANG'S' HERE; MOVIES: A FEW SURVIVING MEMBERS OF THE ORIGINAL 
FILMS ARE HURT THEY WEREN'T IN 'THE LITTLE RASCALS' REMAKE. DIRECTOR PENELOPE 
SPHEERIS SAYS SHE DIDN'T MEAN TO OFFEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 This week Universal Studios released "The Little Rascals," a 
multimillion-dollar remake of the scruffy kid series that has charmed the world 
since its birth in 1922. This "Rascals" is remarkably faithful to the Hal Roach 
originals, right down to Alfalfa's cowlick, Darla's feminine mystique, Froggy's 
croak and the circle around Petey's eye. Even some of the original locations 
have been used, with filming in Burbank neighborhoods unchanged since the '20s 
and '30s. 
</P>
<P>
 Otay , as Buckwheat would say, then what's missing? 
</P>
<P>
 According to some former cast members from the original "Our Gang" films, they 
are. (The series wasn't retitled "The Little Rascals" until it first aired on 
television in the 1950s.) Universal, it seems, turned a chilly shoulder to the 
handful of surviving Our Gangers who warmed the hearts of so many. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel we should have been included," says Tommy Bond, who played Alfalfa's 
nemesis, Butch, in 27 films. "I think we all felt a little hurt that we 
weren't." 
</P>
<P>
 Bond, now 68 and a retired television production executive living in Madeira, 
Calif., is currently touring for his newly published book of memoirs, "Darn 
Right It's Butch," and publicizing Cabin Fever Home Video's release of 48 
restored "Our Gang" episodes. Bond is also known for his role as Jimmy Olson in 
two late '40s Superman serials, before leaving acting for production. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to Bill Thomas Jr. (son of the late Bill (Buckwheat) Thomas), who's 
a police officer in Los Angeles," Bond says. "He contacted (the studio) and was 
invited down to visit the set, but he felt they didn't want us involved. None 
of the original kids were. However, it's their nickel, they can do what they 
want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The omission is doubly hurtful, the surviving cast members say, because the 
new film was directed by Penelope Spheeris, who made such a point in her last 
film, "The Beverly Hillbillies," of including TV-show star Buddy Ebsen in the 
film. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of the original Rascals were included," says Bob Satterfield, a former 
Grand Sheik of the Sons of the Desert, a group of Laurel and Hardy film buffs. 
"I'd say they were a little ticked off, especially since it's a group that's 
been so faithful to the memory of the original films." 
</P>
<P>
 Because Hal Roach produced Laurel and Hardy as well as the Gang, the child 
actors were used in the comedy team's films. As a result, Satterfield's group 
maintains an extensive network of contacts with the surviving Gangsters. The 
list of Gang graduates includes the famous -- actors Jackie Cooper and Robert 
Blake -- and other players who long ago gave up show business. The best-known 
cast members, Carl (Alfalfa) Switzer, Darla Hood, William (Buckwheat) Thomas 
and George (Spanky) McFarland, have died. McFarland, a Texas businessman who 
had enjoyed a revival in celebrity for his childhood role as the plucky, chubby 
president of the He-Man Womun Haters Club, died of a heart attack in June, 
1993, at age 65. Roach himself nearly outlived them all, succumbing in 
November, 1992, at the age of 100. 
</P>
<P>
 One survivor, Eugene Jackson, 77, was the original Pineapple from the silent 
Our Gang comedies (1924-26). Jackson lives in Compton, where he has a stage 
workshop, continues to get small roles in films and television and performs as 
a jazz musician. He replies with an emphatic "no" when asked if he'd been 
contacted by Universal to participate in the film. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to get in touch with them," Jackson says with a note of indignity. "I 
called the studio, casting, whatever, told them who I was, offered to be a 
consultant or something, nothing happened. I called for months, when I first 
heard about it. I haven't seen the movie yet, but there's a lot of us still 
around . . . Butch, you know. They could have had us at least sitting around, 
or just walking by. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's real cold," he says of Universal's attitude. "They have no respect for 
the old-timers. At least they could have recognized some of the living legends 
surviving from the first films." 
</P>
<P>
 "To my knowledge only two (original cast members) are still living, Butch and 
the Woim (Sid Kibrick, a Beverly Hills-based contractor)," says Spheeris. 
"Spanky McFarland died just as we got under way. There had been some discussion 
about (using him). 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not use (Butch and the Woim) because I heard there was a lawsuit 
between one of them and one of the companies involved." 
</P>
<P>
 King World, MGM and Universal own various rights to the Little Rascals. In 
1990, Bond brought suit against King World and MGM for alleged unauthorized use 
of his image. Bond, the only non-contract player in the "Our Gang" films, 
contended he still owned the rights to his image. He settled out of court 
nearly four years ago with King World, which has ties to the current film, and 
still has a suit pending against MGM.  
</P>
<P>
 "I did get a lot of letters from relatives of actors that had been involved," 
Spheeris adds. "We'd tell them they were welcome to come to visit the sets, but 
we couldn't justify including relatives of actors in the movie." Spheeris says 
she had cordial encounters with Buckwheat's son when he visited the set, and 
the brother of the late Matthew (Stymie) Beard at a recent screening. 
</P>
<P>
 Spheeris says she regrets if she has offended anyone. If any of the surviving 
principles had contacted her, she says, "I would have done something. I do 
understand how they must have felt, having been so close to it. The last thing 
I want to do on making a movie on this subject is make anyone unhappy." 
</P>
<P>
 Sadly, not all survivors are capable of participating. Joe Cobb, 77, the 
original chubby kid who starred in 86 silent "Our Gang" films and early 
talkies, lives in Los Angeles, but is in poor health. Cobb went into defense 
work as an assembler in 1942, and continued working for 30 years for the 
company that became Rockwell International. Regarding his portly stature as a 
child, which at under 5 feet tall he still retains, he says that "children in 
my day were either cornfed or milk-fed, and I was both."  
</P>
<P>
 Some, frankly, have lost interest in what happened so long ago. Mel Jasgur, 
who played Junior and Slapsy from age 18 months to 3 years before permanently 
retiring from show business, bares no ill-will toward the new film's makers. 
Says the 58-year-old owner of Encino's Jack Rabbit Press, "I don't really have 
any feelings one way or the other."  
</P>

 "I joked to some of my friends they should have hired me to be a consultant," 
says Darwood (Waldo) Kenneth Smith, "but it was just a joke." Smith's character 
was an unctuous rich boy competing with Alfalfa for Darla's affection. Seeking 
a higher calling than Hollywood, Smith became a Seventh-day Adventist minister. 
Now living in Tujunga, he will retire in October when he turns 65.

my feelings or anything that we weren't."

 A Different Take: Roseanne's spokesman confirmed Friday that she is planning 
to produce a Hanukkah-themed special, which will air this year on ABC. While 
the details are still undecided, rest assured that Roseanne's recognition of 
the Jewish holiday -- which this year runs from Nov. 28-Dec. 5 -- will offer a 
definite alternative to the usual seasonal fare. LEGAL FILE

 He Can Afford It: A federal civil court jury Friday found that Bill Cosby 
touched and shoved a New York photographer who sued the entertainer for 
allegedly roughing him up at a benefit at which Cosby's wife was being honored. 
But the jury also said that the photographer was 90% responsible for the 
incident, awarding "nominal damages" of $1 for each charge of assault and 
battery. With Cosby 10% responsible, he's liable for 20 cents. Dick Corkery, a 
photographer with the New York Daily News, hailed the award as "a victory," 
even though he had originally sought $3 million in damages. "All along I felt 
like David fighting Goliath," he added. Cosby was not in court when the jury 
announced its verdict.

 'Three Graces' Decision Expected: A long-extended effort by the J. Paul Getty 
Museum to buy the neo-classical sculpture "The Three Graces" by Antonio Canova 
will reach a decisive point this weekend in London. In 1989, the Getty agreed 
to purchase the marble sculpture for 7.6 million pounds sterling (about $12.6 
million) from a private party, but the necessary export license has been 
repeatedly deferred to allow London's Victoria and Albert Museum to match the 
Getty's price and purchase the artwork for its own collection, thereby keeping 
the sculpture in England. An export license deferral expired Friday, when the 
British museum had raised a total of 4.7 million pounds toward the acquisition. 
British trade authorities are expected to reassess the situation over the 
weekend and announce their decision early next week. Sian Evans,a press officer 
for the British museum, suggested three scenarios: An export license could be 
granted, clearing the way for the Getty to get the sculpture; the deferral 
could be extended to allow more time for British fund-raising; or a wealthy 
third party could step in and contribute the 2.9-million pound short-fall. "The 
third possibility may not sound likely," Evans said, "but stranger things have 
happened." POP/ROCK

TV VIOLENCE RISES 41% OVER PAST 2 YEARS, STUDY SHOWS; TELEVISION: NETWORK 
OFFICIALS ASSAIL FINDINGS BY THE CENTER FOR MEDIA AND PUBLIC AFFAIRS AS 
'IRRESPONSIBLE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG BRAXTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite self-proclaimed efforts by the television industry to lessen violence 
amid threats by federal legislators, TV violence actually increased by 41% over 
the past two years, according to a study released Friday by a nonprofit 
research organization. 
</P>
<P>
 The findings were immediately attacked by network officials, who called the 
study "irresponsible" and inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 The Center for Media and Public Affairs said it counted 2,605 violent scenes 
during the first Thursday in April this year on 10 broadcast and cable 
channels, up from 1,846 violent scenes from a similar study done on the same 
day in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, which conducts scientific studies on how the media treat social 
and political issues, monitored 18 continuous hours of programming on ABC, NBC, 
CBS, Fox, PBS, independent WDCA-TV and cable channels MTV, HBO, TBS and USA. 
Included were news programs, music videos, cartoons, toy commercials and promos 
for upcoming movies and series, along with prime-time entertainment, which has 
drawn the most fire from government officials who claim that television 
violence may be contributing to the rise of violence in society. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Lichter, director of the Washington-based center, said: "The whole idea of 
the study was to look at all programming. People are always focusing on 
prime-time entertainment, and television is much more than that. The point is 
not to say that this is representative of every day, but that here is what is 
happening on a typical day." 
</P>
<P>
 Lichter added, "There were increases in violence in every category of program. 
There were pervasive increases in fiction and nonfiction programs, children's 
and adult programs, and in promos. This suggests that this is something that we 
should be concerned about." 
</P>
<P>
 The study said the average hourly rate of scenes of violence per channel 
increased from 10 to nearly 15 between 1992 and 1994. Acts of life-threatening 
violence, such as assaults with deadly weapons, rose 67%, from 751 to 1,252 
scenes, while scenes involving gun play climbed 45%, from 362 to 526. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The largest increase in violence was seen in news programs -- 209%, the study 
said. The news that day included coverage of violence in Rwanda, South Africa, 
the Middle East and Bosnia, while local news shows gave prominence to a 
shooting in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Network officials instantly denounced the study, which will appear in next 
week's TV Guide. 
</P>
<P>
 "This study is a totally irresponsible approach to the issue of violence on 
television," NBC said in a statement. "It is clearly designed to make news, not 
to make a responsible contribution to the debate." 
</P>
<P>
 Janice Gretemeyer, a spokeswoman for ABC, said: "We have looked at our 
programming for that day and find it hard to realize how anyone would 
characterize it as violent. That evening, we ran an episode of the family drama 
'The Byrds of Paradise,' a repeat of 'Matlock' and, on 'PrimeTime Live,' a 
story about twins being switched at birth." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), who has led the government fight in trying to get 
industry executives to regulate violence before legislators try to impose 
mandatory restrictions on them, also did not seem too impressed with the 
center's study. 
</P>
<P>
 "The report is important in terms of keeping a spotlight on TV violence," said 
Simon spokesman Robert Shireman. "But it only looks at one day, which may not 
be a valid approach. It includes the news along with entertainment programming. 
There may be too much violence on news, but the senator's focus has been on 
entertainment programs in prime time. On that score, we have seen some 
progress." 
</P>
<P>
 The four major commercial networks and the cable industry, under prodding from 
Congress, have themselves hired outside firms to conduct studies of TV violence 
over the next three years. Both research efforts are still in the early stages. 
</P>
<P>
 Shireman said Simon feels those efforts should continue.

MUSIC REVIEW; WATTS SHINES IN RACHMANINOFF AT BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Musicians playfully refer to it as "Rocky II." The musical equivalent of a 
summertime popcorn movie, Rachmaninoff's Second Piano Concerto might have been 
written with the Hollywood Bowl in mind. It seemed that way Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 No one would accuse the composer of being subtle in this work. His tunes gush 
more than they cajole, his climactic points, especially those in the finale, 
are perfectly set up and, when reached, underlined. The piece delivers on its 
promises, as well-worn as they may be, and requires very little effort from the 
listener. It practically sits in your lap and musses your hair for you. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the best thing about Andre Watts' performance of the work with the Los 
Angeles Philharmonic before an appreciative crowd of 12,578 was that there was 
no pretending that it was something that it isn't. This was a no-holds-barred 
account, full of heart-on-your-sleeve rhapsody, gutsy fortissimos and big, 
sweeping lines. The only illogical response to it is enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps much of what the 48-year-old pianist did would have sounded vulgar 
indoors. Here, it sounded just right. Playing on a steely Yamaha grand, Watts 
brought an unflinching sense of drama and sentiment to the music, floated and 
whispered its poetry without losing sight of where he was going, produced 
crashing and muscular thrills without bogging down and even managed some 
kittenish elegance along the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Substituting on short notice for Carlo Rizzi, conductor George Cleve, making 
his Philharmonic and Bowl debuts at age 58, accompanied cannily, matching the 
grandeur and gusto of the pianist, note for note. In fact, he had accompanied 
the same pianist in the same concerto the night before in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 As bookends, Cleve led vital performances of Mozart's "Die Zauberflote" 
Overture and Brahms' Fourth Symphony. The former assistant to Monteux and Szell 
seems to have learned a thing or two about the value of plainspeak. With the 
full orchestra in Mozart, he fashioned a swift, tidy and vivacious run-through. 
</P>
<P>
 In his clear-eyed Brahms, he enforced rhythmic clarity and vigor, refused to 
dawdle over particulars, yet sculpted phrases and discovered nuances. The 
Philharmonic answered heartily, mostly neatly, some over-amplified horn playing 
notwithstanding, and showed that Brahms straightahead works.TIMOTHY MANGAN

EXHIBITION MEANS THIS CHRIS PLAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Today's exhibition game against the Packers at Camp Randall Stadium will allow 
the Rams to rehearse for the regular season, which explains why Chris Chandler 
will start in place of Chris Miller at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, well-known for his accurate passes and physical misfortune, will miss 
today's game because of a sore abdominal muscle and tender right knee. The 
injuries are not considered serious, but they accentuate the Rams' need to 
employ a second quarterback with starting capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's no secret," said Chandler, who was 9-4 as a starting rookie 
quarterback for the Colts in 1988. "I thought this was the best place for a 
chance to help a team out, but I didn't look solely at the fact that Chris has 
gotten hurt a lot the last few years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to work with somebody who would make it easy to be around, and Chris 
is real easy to be around. That played a big part in my decision to come here. 
If nothing else, we'll have a fun season." 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterbacks have fun when given the chance to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler left Indianapolis because he wasn't going to have that chance once 
Jeff George arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "After my first year in Indy I thought, 'Look out, Johnny Unitas.' I thought I 
was going to be there for the next 12 years," Chandler said. "But one bad cut 
on the turf, and boom , there goes an anterior cruciate ligament. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt Indy gave up on me before I was able to show I was back with my knee. 
They shut the door too soon." 
</P>
<P>
 Traded to Tampa Bay, Chandler criticized Buccaneer management for playing 
Vinny Testaverde, and a few days later Chandler was fired. 
</P>
<P>
 "I apologized the next day, but sometimes you can't take things back," 
Chandler said. "Ray Perkins traded for me and said he was going to give Vinny 
one more year. At the end of that year, Perkins got fired, Richard Williamson 
took over and I don't think he shared the same opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals claimed Chandler off waivers, he became a starter, but then 
wanted out of Phoenix after playing Ed McMahon to Steve Beuerlein. 
</P>
<P>
 "I needed to get out of the situation I was in," Chandler said. "Chris is a 
good friend, which makes this situation so much easier than the other one." 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago Chandler told the media in Phoenix, "I know I'm not a backup." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, however, is the Rams' clear-cut starter, and Chandler's a backup. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a chance to play and played well in Phoenix, but when your team is 
4-12, you get blamed," Chandler said. "Playing isn't always the thing. Look at 
Beuerlein, he played five games for a Dallas Cowboy team that went to the 
playoffs and became the hottest property around. Sometimes you have to be in 
the right situation and get the good break." 
</P>
<P>
 The Minnesota Vikings were interested in signing Chandler this past off-season 
with the purpose of making him their starter, but that was before they swung a 
deal for Warren Moon. Chandler remains just a backup. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a time when I'd say, 'Dang it, I can't let people say that about 
me,' " Chandler said. "That would actually affect me. As I've gotten older, 
survival has made me a lot less affected about what other people say or do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't sit here and feel sorry for myself and ask, 'Why haven't I had a team 
like San Francisco to play for or an organization like Miami to play for?' 
People don't want to hear that." 
</P>
<P>
 After serving hard time in Indianapolis, Tampa and Phoenix, why the Rams? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time I've been with a quality, proven head coach," Chandler 
said. "Ron Meyer was fun to play for because training camp was easy, but as far 
as his honesty and integrity, there wasn't any. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got along with Perkins because he traded a No. 1 pick for me, but he was 
fired. Then I got a receivers coach in Williamson, and in Phoenix, Joe Bugel 
was a great offensive line coach, but the jury was still out on how good a head 
coach he was going to be." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams took a look at several backup candidates during the offseason, 
including Jack Trudeau and Dave Krieg, but Knox wanted Chandler from the 
outset. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I've gotten the chance to play consistently, I have always played well," 
Chandler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler gets the chance to play against the Packers, and a chance to play a 
lot because of injuries to Miller and T.J. Rubley (sore arm). 
</P>
<P>
 "Jamie Martin and I are going to get all the work, which is something you kind 
of dread, because you like to try and stay healthy in preseason," Chandler 
said. "I've been in this offense for about a month, so being under the gun in a 
game situation is exactly what I need. From that standpoint I'm looking forward 
to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I have to do anything in terms of who I am. This is the 
preseason, you can go out and stink or be the best quarterback ever, and it 
doesn't mean a thing. It's just the preseason." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams were winless in four exhibition games last season and it served as a 
warning of things to come. This year's plan is to find success in exhibition 
games, build on it, but avoid injury at all costs. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Miller, the Rams will not play defensive end Robert Young 
(groin), cornerback Steve Israel (hamstring), wide receiver Sean LaChapelle 
(ankle), wide receiver Todd Kinchen (knee), running back David Lang (knee) and 
cornerback Darryl Henley (bail restrictions). 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Jerome Bettis, who is healthy, will also not play -- because it's 
just the exhibition season.

UCI GIVES BAKER TWO-YEAR CONTRACT EXTENSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rod Baker received a two-year contract extension Friday to remain as head 
basketball coach at UC Irvine through the 1996-97 season, turning down an offer 
to join mentor George Blaney as an associate head coach at Seton Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters' record in Baker's three years at Irvine is 23-63. They were 
4-14 in Big West play last season, but rebounded with a remarkable run to the 
final of the conference tournament, winning three in a row before falling seven 
points shy of earning an NCAA tournament berth. 
</P>
<P>
 Baker and staff maintained the momentum with one of the best recruiting years 
in school history, signing highly sought Latvian point guard Raimonds 
Miglinieks (Riverside College), forward Michael Tate (Ventura College) and 
forward Kevin Simmons (Tilden High in New York). 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic Director Dan Guerrero, who always has praised Baker for his emphasis 
on academics, relationships with players and leadership skills, said last 
season that in light of all that, victories and losses remain the ultimate 
measuring stick for coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Anteaters' performance and Baker's game management in the 
conference tournament -- topped by the recruiting successes -- made it 
"prudent," in Guerrero's estimation, to offer Baker an extension to the 
four-year deal that would have expired after the 1994-95 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made the decision a year earlier than we maybe would have otherwise," 
Guerrero said, "but some things that have occurred between the Big West 
tournament and now have given me the indicators that we're headed in the right 
direction. We think we're going to be a much-improved product. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we demonstrated in the tournament was the real ability to make the 
adjustments necessary to be competitive game in and game out. That was very 
critical. And the recruiting was sort of just icing on the cake." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker, who was named coach at Irvine on April 10, 1991, after three years as 
an assistant to P.J. Carlesimo at Seton Hall, played for Blaney at Holy Cross 
and was his assistant in 1976-77. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a tough decision because of the opportunity to work with a guy who I 
have an awful lot of respect for, a guy who I don't know if I could ever do 
enough to repay all he's done for me," Baker said. "But when all is said and 
done, this is where I work, this is where my heart is and this is the place 
where I'm trying to make my mark on the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the fact that we have good players and the foundation from which to move 
in a positive direction are reasons enough to want to benefit from our labors." 
</P>
<P>
 Baker would like to have bottled some of the magic of those four days in Las 
Vegas last March when the Anteaters, seeded last in the tournament, upset UC 
Santa Barbara, Utah State and Pacific before losing to New Mexico State, 70-64, 
in the championship game. He probably would re-open the bottle Nov. 30 when the 
Anteaters make their 1994-95 regular-season debut at Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, that was more than four days of divine intervention," Baker said. 
"In fact, things did come into place. Now, we just need to not move them too 
far out of place and get the new people on the same page as everybody else. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we need to do more than just retain that. We need to move on from there."

VISITATION RITES; MARINERS' LOVULLO GETS OLD FAMILIAR FEELING AT BIG A 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Torey Lovullo walked into familiar surroundings this week at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of heading for the home team's clubhouse, as he had so many times 
before, he went through the doors marked "Visitors." 
</P>
<P>
 Once inside, he pulled on the gray pants and blue practice jersey of the 
Seattle Mariners, donned a cap with an "S" on it and headed to the field. 
</P>
<P>
 His work day was just beginning, but waves of emotion had already begun 
rolling over him. This was his first game back in the major leagues and his 
first day back at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Lovullo, 29, was an Angel for only one season, but memories and friendships 
die hard. Heck, Prime Ticket almost nightly runs a tape of Lovullo hurling his 
batting helmet into the air after his hit beat the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
 J.T. Snow, Lovullo's best friend on the Angels and his roommate when they were 
members of the Yankee organization, is the enemy now, along with other buddies 
such as Gary DiSarcina and Chad Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
 "My best friends in the game are on that team," Lovullo had earlier told a 
reporter. "It was hard. I had talked to J.T. on the phone. Now, seeing them all 
together, that was strange. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just glad to be back home in Anaheim. I'm excited. I want to stick it to 
(the Angels). I want to have the game on the line and do a number on them."  
</P>
<P>
 Lovullo, from Montclair Prep and UCLA, played in 116 major league games last 
year, a career high, batting .251 with six home runs and 30 runs batted in. 
They were modest numbers, but Lovullo's impact extended beyond statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Two clutch hits stand out in the Angels' unexpectedly successful first half of 
'93. Without those sorts of contributions, the Angels this season have fallen 
into what seems to be an emotional abyss. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels released Lovullo during spring training, opting instead for Rex 
Hudler and Spike Owen as their utility infielders. 
</P>
<P>
 Lovullo was stung by the move but now says he had only himself to blame. After 
his first full season as a major league player, he said he eased up a little 
bit, and didn't work as hard as usual over the winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps he fooled himself with his success. There were reasons to be content 
as an Angel. 
</P>
<P>
 In an early 1993 game against Boston and Roger Clemens, Lovullo hit what 
turned out to be the game-winning homer in a 2-1 Angel victory.  
</P>
<P>
 The Angels' postgame mood was joyous. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, on the day before the All-Star break, Lovullo's bases-loaded single in 
the 14th inning gave the Angels a 3-2 victory over the Yankees. It also pulled 
the Angels within two games of first place in the American League West. 
</P>
<P>
 You've probably seen the tape dozens of times by now, maybe without realizing 
what it was. Half-running, half-skipping, Lovullo rounded first base, tore off 
his helmet and chucked it skyward. In a flash, he was mobbed by teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 Sports, L.A. style.  
</P>
<P>
 If there was a defining moment of the Angels' fast start, that was it. After 
the break, they faltered, unable to keep pace in the AL West. But Lovullo 
always hoped management would remember the good times of '93. 
</P>
<P>
 Near the end of spring training, the Angels cut him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll fault myself for the rest of my life," said Lovullo, who was claimed 
from the waiver wire by Seattle on April 1. "I wasn't ready for spring 
training. I felt last year I would be ready without working the way I did 
before. I was kind of shocked. I knew they had to make a move, but (getting 
released) was the last thing on my mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Time has passed, but Lovullo can't forget his past as an Angel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd be lying if I said I didn't think a lot about last year," he said. "It's 
baseball. It's a business. (But) I had an awfully good time here last year." 
</P>
<P>
 This week proved to be another adventure in the business side of the game for 
Lovullo. Tuesday, he traded places with 19-year-old shortstop Alex Rodriguez, 
who was optioned to triple-A Calgary. It marks Lovullo's third stint in the 
major leagues this season. In his first 30 games, he batted .213 with two 
homers and seven runs batted in. 
</P>
<P>
 While searching for his niche with the Mariners, Lovullo still dwells on his 
heavenly days as an Angel. 
</P>
<P>
 "I miss the heck out of them," he said of his former teammates. "But you have 
to move on. I think I need to get in the lineup and show how I can play the 
game."

STADIUM PLAN GAINS KEY SUPPORT; PALMDALE: MAYOR GIVES CONDITIONAL APPROVAL TO 
LAND-ACQUISITION DEAL THAT COULD LEAD TO ESTABLISHMENT OF MINOR LEAGUE 
FRANCHISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In what could mark the first step toward the establishment of a minor league 
baseball franchise in the Antelope Valley, Palmdale Mayor Jim Ledford has given 
his conditional support to a plan that would donate city land for a baseball 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is in the final stages of purchasing a 117-acre parcel of land 
between Palmdale and Lancaster, Ledford said Friday. The City Council will 
begin discussing the purchase next week. 
</P>
<P>
 If the purchase is completed, 25 acres might be set aside for a stadium to be 
financed and constructed by a Valley-based group calling itself the Golden 
State League, a proposed independent league that hopes to begin play next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Ledford said that based on discussions with league president Bob Weinstein of 
Chatsworth, the city would donate land and the league would erect a $5-million 
stadium that would serve as the centerpiece of the league. 
</P>
<P>
 Ledford said he will outline Weinstein's plan at the City Council meeting next 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a situation where it could be built without cost to the city," Ledford 
said. "That's not typical. . . . We'd really like to have a team here. It's 
almost too good to be true." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chatsworth-based league has been attempting to gain a foothold in the 
region for months and made little progress with city officials in Lancaster.  
</P>
<P>
 Ledford said that if the council members greet the plan enthusiastically, 
Weinstein would be asked to detail his financial backing. 
</P>
<P>
 If the league can prove its resources are in order, matters could proceed 
swiftly. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he can actually pull a rabbit out of a hat, we'd be remiss not to pursue 
this," Ledford said. "(The land acquisition) is not a done deal, but it has 
possibilities. I'm excited about it." 
</P>
<P>
 A proposed league member -- the Antelope Valley Ravens -- could become the 
first professional baseball team in the region since 1986 and only the second 
in the past 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein plans to field a six-team league of independent clubs. Several 
independent leagues, composed of teams with no major league affiliation or 
player-development contract, have sprung up across the nation over the past two 
seasons, including the highly successful Northern League, based in Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein, a Chatsworth mortgage broker, said he is negotiating with various 
officials about the possibility of placing teams in Merced, Brawley, Indio, 
Vista and one undisclosed site. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinstein has negotiated with officials from Lancaster for several months 
about placing a team in the area, but no agreement could be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm anything, I'm tenacious," Weinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the league comes to pass, Palmdale officials are certain that residents of 
the Antelope Valley would support the team. The Antelope Valley's demographics 
-- plenty of young families looking for activities in the region -- make a 
large appetite for baseball likely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's any doubt (the area would support it)," said Al McCord, 
Palmdale's director of economic development. "We'd support baseball, hockey, 
whatever. 
</P>
<P>
 "People here are looking for recreation. Lots of them commute to work every 
day and need things around here to do on the weekend. They don't want to drive 
down to L.A. (on their day off)." 
</P>
<P>
 Once groundbreaking takes place, a stadium could be completed in roughly six 
months, Weinstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Judge, a Palmdale councilman, believes the plan will be well-received. 
</P>
<P>
 "The overall concept is positive and intriguing," Judge said. "It's definitely 
worth exploring." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1955, the San Fernando Valley-Ventura County region has fielded a pro 
baseball team for exactly one season. In 1986, the Ventura Gulls played in the 
Class-A California League but relocated when the season ended. Channel Cities, 
located in northern Ventura County, concluded its two-year existence after the 
1955 season.

STROH RESIGNS AS GRANADA HILLS CO-COACH; HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL: HE STEPS DOWN 
AFTER NINE SUCCESSFUL SEASONS BUT WILL STAY ON AS BASEBALL COACH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Darryl Stroh, whose teams won City Section titles in two major sports at 
Granada Hills High, has stepped down after nine seasons as co-coach of the 
school's successful football team. 
</P>
<P>
 Stroh, who led the Highlanders to the 4-A Division football crown in 1987 with 
an upset of heavily favored and nationally ranked Carson, told the team this 
week that he will not coach in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Stroh, 55, announced last spring that he planned to coach his final season in 
1994 while school administrators sought a replacement for the following year. 
John Wordin, a former assistant at El Camino Real, was hired in June to coach 
the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 When Wordin was hired, Stroh hinted that he might step down immediately, but 
said he wanted to tell the players himself. Preseason conditioning began this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it's fun and it doesn't seem like a job, it's fine," Stroh said. "I just 
don't enjoy it as much anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The Highlanders were 68-28-1 under Stroh and co-Coach Tom Harp, but were 3-7 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hasn't been as stimulating over the last two or three years," Stroh said. 
"Over the last few seasons, I didn't have my heart in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Harp will remain as head coach, but said he is unsure whether he will coach 
beyond this fall. Harp will handle the offense and Wordin will take over 
Stroh's duties as defensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "It worked out well being co-coaches," Harp said. "We divided up the 
responsibilities and got a lot done. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will give him more relaxation time. (Coaching) is almost a year-round 
thing. You don't get any breaks." 
</P>
<P>
 Stroh will remain as the school's baseball coach. Under Stroh, the Highlanders 
have won five 4-A baseball titles. He is believed to be the only active coach 
to have won championships in both sports.

WHERE ARE THEY NOW: GUY SULARZ; BASEBALL BURNOUT FINDS SPARK BY FIGHTING FIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Typical Guy Sularz. Still putting out fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Need somebody to fill in over here? Call Sularz. 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody lacking something over there? Call Sularz. 
</P>
<P>
 First as a baseball player and now as a Phoenix firefighter, Sularz, it seems, 
always is on call. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from North Hollywood High in 1974, Sularz spent 10 years 
playing baseball in the San Francisco Giants organization. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a season and a half of that decade was spent wearing a big-league 
uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 And considerably less time than that was spent actually playing for the 
Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Sularz retired after the 1984 season with a grand total of 206 major-league 
at-bats. He played in 108 games for San Francisco in parts of four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Selected in the 10th round of the 1974 draft as a pitcher and outfielder, 
Sularz was converted to the infield in his second professional season. He was a 
starting shortstop for several minor league seasons, then a full-fledged 
utility player, filling in around the horn. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, almost 10 years after his retirement, he is used similarly by the Phoenix 
fire department. Sularz is a rover, assigned to whichever station needs him 
most on a given day. 
</P>
<P>
 Versatility is a Sularz trait. In high school, along with starring on the 
North Hollywood baseball team, he was a running back on the football team. 
During his senior season in 1973, Sularz was the tailback on a team that won 11 
consecutive games before losing to Carson in the City Section playoff 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Hustle, an impressive work ethic and above-average skills both as a fielder 
and hitter made Sularz attractive to baseball coaches. But by the time he quit, 
he was bitter and burned out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't enjoy playing anymore," Sularz said. "I didn't feel like going to 
the ballpark, and I didn't care if I played. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a hard feeling to accept, especially when you've played baseball all 
your life." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Sularz, after spending five years away from the game, is a fan again. 
</P>
<P>
 A Dodger fan. 
</P>
<P>
 He watches major league games on television, plays for an over-30 amateur 
baseball team and occasionally makes the short drive from his home to 
Scottsdale Stadium for a Phoenix Firebird game. 
</P>
<P>
 Sularz played his best baseball as a member of the Firebirds for all or parts 
of seasons from 1978-84. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the club's career leader with 751 games played, 827 hits, 129 doubles 
and 1,077 total bases. However, his are bittersweet records. 
</P>
<P>
 Sularz spent the majority of his career tantalizingly close to the big 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 So close, yet so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of his major-league time was accrued in 1982 when he had 101 at-bats in 
63 games -- mostly at second base -- for the Giants. He batted .228 that year, 
10 points higher than his career big-league average. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was used to playing all the time," Sularz said. "Coming off the bench was 
tough. I just didn't adjust fast enough." 
</P>
<P>
 When San Francisco signed Joe Morgan to play second base in 1983, Sularz 
anticipated that his chances of sticking with the Giants were diminishing. 
</P>
<P>
 He was right. That season, he stayed in Phoenix until September, than played 
in only 10 games after being recalled. In '84, he didn't play for the Giants at 
all, spending the entire season with Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 The next spring, Sularz received a contract offer from the Giants in the mail. 
It was as a player-coach in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I saw they wanted me to coach it really hit me," Sularz said. "Wow, I 
definitely don't have a future there." 
</P>
<P>
 Only four years earlier Sularz had delivered his first major-league hit, a 
single against the Phillies in a game at Candlestick Park. He recalls Pete 
Rose, Philadelphia's first baseman, catching the ball after it was thrown in 
from the outfield and handing it to him to keep. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first of many," Rose said to him as he handed it over. 
</P>
<P>
 There would be only 44 more. 
</P>
<P>
 Sularz briefly considered requesting a trade to another team, but then he 
decided to quit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't fun anymore," he said. "I just didn't feel like going back." 
</P>
<P>
 He was 28. He had no plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like a lot of guys I'm sure, I hadn't thought much about what I was going to 
do after baseball," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Using money he saved from baseball, Sularz enrolled in junior college while he 
determined a future course. After running into an old minor league opponent who 
was a fireman, he decided to take fire science courses at Rancho Santiago 
College in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Several former baseball players he knew were among his classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 As a firefighter, Sularz has accomplished the kind of quick ascent that failed 
to materialize in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Less than two years after retiring as a player, he was a Scottsdale city 
fireman. Less than a year later, he moved over to Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Sularz is married to Julia, whom he met when he was playing for the Firebirds. 
They have a 4-year-old son, Taylor, and a year-old daughter, Skylar. 
</P>
<P>
 Although happy with his career as a firefighter, Sularz recently has turned 
his attention toward someday returning to baseball as a coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Minton, a former Giant teammate, has hired Sularz and several other 
former professional players to be instructors at a baseball school that will 
open in Scottsdale later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Sularz said that eventually he might try to catch on with a professional team 
as a coach. But not now. He wants to stay around home, where he can spend time 
with his wife and children. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem with trying to become a big-league coach is you have to do your 
stint in the minors," Sularz said. "I don't want to do that traveling bit 
again. That's not for me." 
</P>
<P>
 He would know -- from experience.

YOUTH BASEBALL ROUNDUP; THOUSAND OAKS GAINS WESTERN REGIONAL BERTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Standout defensive plays in the seventh inning gave the Thousand Oaks Little 
League 13-year-old all-star team a 7-5 victory over South Mission Viejo and the 
Southern California Division II championship in La Mirada. 
</P>
<P>
 With two runners on base and one out in the seventh, first baseman Jon Shepard 
made an over-the shoulder catch down the right-field line, then third baseman 
Ryan Ayers backhanded a line drive to end the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Right-handers Matt Rogers and Chris Strauser combined for Thousand Oaks, and 
Strauser was the winning pitcher for the third consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks opens the four-team Western Regional tournament in San Jose on 
Sunday against the champion from a division encompassing the Pacific Northwest 
and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 The Western Regional winner advances to the World Series in Taylor, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake Senators 21, Dublin, Ohio 1 -- Jared Krehbiel led the Westlake 
Senators in the first round of the Continental Amateur Baseball Assn.

 Krehbiel drove in four runs with a home run and a triple. The game was called 
after five innings. Westlake banged out 15 hits and Chris Parker and Jeremy 
Sugarman each drove in four runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake plays a doubleheader today. The Senators take on Enid, Okla., then 
face a team from Wisconsin.

BATTLE-SCARRED HESTER PASSES ON KNOWLEDGE TO YOUNG RECEIVERS; FOOTBALL: FORMER 
RAIDER HELPS ROOKIES LIKE BRUCE WHILE TRYING TO CATCH ON WITH RAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Ram receiver Jessie Hester watches the hazing of rookie receiver Isaac Bruce 
every day during training camp and can't help but smile. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a rite of passage in the NFL, one that every receiver must endure. Twice 
a day, Bruce is schooled by Ram cornerbacks such as Todd Lyght and Robert 
Bailey on the art of running pass routes, the bump-and-run, when to make a cut. 
</P>
<P>
 They can be painful, frustrating lessons, as Hester discovered nine years ago 
as a rookie with the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tough," Hester said, smiling. "It was real tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially when you're lining up against two all-pro cornerbacks such as Mike 
Haynes and Lester Hayes. For one summer, they pounded Hester as he had never 
been pounded before. 
</P>
<P>
 That's Mike Haynes, an all-pro in 1984 and '85. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's Lester Hayes, author of the book "They Call Me Assassin," one of 
the hardest hitters and trashiest trash talkers ever to put on a helmet. He was 
an all-pro in four of the five seasons before Hester arrived as a first-round 
draft pick from Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
 Let the punishment begin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lester and Mike came at me every day," Hester said. "They just shut me down. 
I couldn't get off the ball against them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Haynes was pretty quiet, didn't talk much. Lester, he talked all the time and 
he always backed it up. That was really intimidating, especially for a rookie. 
It got to the point where I would laugh when it was over, but it wasn't funny 
at the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Day after day. Practice after practice. Hester couldn't get open. Hayes would 
knock him back, take him out of his route. Haynes would come out of nowhere to 
knock the ball away. 
</P>
<P>
 More talk. More intimidation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got to the point where I was starting to wonder if I belonged in the NFL," 
Hester said. "I was never so frustrated in my entire life. That's the way it 
was in my early days. Everyone thought I was getting burned all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 But a funny thing happened to Hester on the way to his first exhibition game 
-- he started getting open. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the end of camp, the bump-and-run didn't phase me at all," Hester said. 
"Still doesn't." 
</P>
<P>
 "I got off to a pretty good start (in his first exhibition game, against the 
Washington Redskins). I ran an out-and-up pattern and caught it for a long 
touchdown, but it got called back on a holding penalty. But I'll always 
remember that one. It was still a score." 
</P>
<P>
 Hester started 16 games that first season, setting Raider rookie records with 
32 catches for 665 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine years later, Hester enters the Rams' camp as a well-traveled veteran, 
having played one season for Atlanta and the last four with the Indianapolis 
Colts. 
</P>
<P>
 He's competing with 12 other receivers for five or six roster spots. And he's 
working with the Rams' younger receivers, such as Bruce and fourth-round pick 
Chris Brantley. 
</P>
<P>
 Hester's best piece of advice? Patience, patience and more patience. 
</P>
<P>
 "They (rookies) tend to rush things," Hester said. "In this league, you have 
to be under control, patient when you run your routes." 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce has been listening. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I'm learning to be patient," he said. "I know I have to take it a 
little slower and read the defense. The big thing is how they disguise the 
defenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not so much where the defender starts, but where he finishes. I've 
learned a lot about that from Jessie. Now, I'm trying to get closer to the 
defense before I make my break. I'm trying to run more precise routes." 
</P>
<P>
 Hester and Bruce share a common thread entering today's exhibition opener 
against Green Bay in Madison, Wis. Bruce, a lock to make the team after the 
Rams drafted him in the second round, wants to show he can contend for a 
starting spot. So does Hester, who is battling to make the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to remind the coaches here that I can still play," said Hester, 
31. "I might be a little older than some of these guys, but I can still run and 
catch the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 So does Bruce find it a little strange, getting advice from a veteran he's 
competing with for a roster spot? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not strange to me," Bruce said. "We all help each other out." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams hope Hester, Bruce and a rejuvenated Flipper Anderson can make up for 
their failed attempt to trade for Dallas' Alvin Harper and inability to sign 
free-agent Haywood Jeffires of Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hester, the Rams get a durable, consistent receiver who has started 48 
consecutive games in the past three seasons, averaging 59 catches a season 
during that time. 
</P>
<P>
 In Bruce, the Rams get a smooth, athletic route-runner that some draft 
analysts rated ahead of some first-round picks. He led Memphis State in 
receiving last season with 74 catches for 1,054 yards and 10 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 And after a week of mini-camp workouts and two weeks of training camp, Bruce 
is ready to show what he can do as a pro. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm ready to give this a try," he said. "I really look at this as a win-win 
situation for me."

 A 19-year-old Oxnard woman was taken to Ventura County Memorial Hospital 
complaining of head and neck pains and numbness in her face following a pair of 
first-lap crashes in Friday night's 10-lap Pony Stock main event at Ventura 
Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 Joanna Brown's racer collided with a car driven by Oxnard's Jim Jewett Jr. in 
the backstretch at the start of the race, touching off a seven-car collision, 
then she spun in Turn 3 on the restart, getting hit in succession by Jewett and 
Thomas Parker of Moorpark. 
</P>
<P>
 The race, originally scheduled for 15 laps, was cut short due to time 
constraints. The track has an 11 p.m. curfew. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a 10-minute delay as crews carefully removed Brown from her car and 
took her to the hospital, followed by another 15-minute wait until a backup 
ambulance arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was listed in stable condition at press time. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Gens Jr. of Oxnard won the shortened feature, driving the same car that 
Tayo Sahagun used last week to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Gill of Somis took the 15-lap mini stock main by one-quarter lap over 
Camarillo's Gary Curtis.

 James Weston of Santa Barbara outran points leader Paul Moore of Oak View for 
his fourth 20-lap street stock victory.

FISKE OUSTED IN WHITEWATER CASE; MOVE IS SURPRISE; INVESTIGATION: FEDERAL 
THREE-JUDGE PANEL NAMES KENNETH STARR AS NEW SPECIAL COUNSEL. SWITCH IS SEEN AS 
PROLONGING PROBE. THE ACTION STUNS CLINTON'S ADVISERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA FRITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The controversial Whitewater criminal investigation took a surprising turn 
Friday when a three-judge panel replaced special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. 
with Kenneth W. Starr, solicitor general under former President George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 The move stunned President Clinton's advisers, who had asked the court to 
reappoint Fiske under the terms of a newly enacted independent counsel law that 
had lapsed when the investigation began more than six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 At the White House, Counsel Lloyd N. Cutler issued a terse statement saying 
that the President will continue to "cooperate fully" with the investigation 
into allegations that Clinton may have benefited from money funneled to the 
Whitewater Development Corp. from a now-defunct Arkansas savings and loan owned 
by James B. McDougal, his investment partner in the Whitewater real estate 
venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, although the three-judge panel said that it needed to replace 
Fiske to assure the independence of the investigation because he had been 
chosen by the Clinton Administration, the switch actually could heighten the 
partisan nature of the inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 While both Fiske and Starr are Republicans, Starr is widely viewed as a more 
partisan choice because of his service under Clinton's 1992 political opponent 
and because he is said to have given legal advice to the lawyers for Paula 
Corbin Jones, the woman who is suing Clinton for alleged sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, lawyers involved in the case predicted that the switch in 
investigators will delay the conclusion of the investigation, perhaps forcing 
Clinton to defend himself against embarrassing conclusions closer to the 1996 
presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only problem with this is the time it's going to take . . . " said 
Clinton political adviser Bob Shrum. "The frustrating thing here is that this 
will probably delay it some weeks or months." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior White House official, who declined to be identified by name, said the 
President's aides believe that they are being treated unfairly, facing "a kind 
of double jeopardy" with the switch to a second prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the terms of his appointment by the court, Starr has wide-ranging 
authority to either accept all of the work that Fiske has done so far or to 
begin the investigation over again. Lawyers involved in the case predicted that 
he would keep on some of Fiske's appointees to ensure continuity. 
</P>
<P>
 The setback for Clinton comes at a time when he is suffering the effects of 
unfavorable publicity generated by nearly two weeks of Whitewater hearings in 
Congress, which have focused on questionable contacts between the Treasury 
Department and the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans, who have been critical of Fiske's approach, immediately applauded 
the choice of Starr. Rep. Jim Leach of Iowa, the President's leading Republican 
critic on Whitewater, praised the choice of Starr, whom he described as a man 
of "impeccable credentials and stature." 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Eastland, a former Republican Justice Department official who worked 
with Starr, said that the White House should view Starr's appointment as a 
plus. "If he clears him," he said, "that's the best news Clinton could have." 
</P>
<P>
 Starr, 48, now an attorney in private practice, is high on the Republicans' 
list of possible future appointees to the Supreme Court. He has served on the 
U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington as well as having been solicitor general. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Gilbert Davis -- who represents Jones in her suit alleging that 
Clinton, when he was governor of Arkansas, lured her into a hotel room and 
asked her for oral sex -- told The Times that Starr had offered to draft an 
amicus brief supporting his defendant's right to sue the President. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Starr declined to comment but he told a PBS interviewer "that 
it's a very serious step" to argue, as the President has, that he is above such 
lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiske came under fire from Republicans recently when he concluded that the 
death last summer of former Deputy White House Counsel Vincent Foster was a 
suicide, not a murder, and that the controversial White House-Treasury 
discussions violated no law. Some Republicans, such as Rep. Dan Burton of 
Indiana, still think that he may have been wrong on both counts. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, 10 GOP congressmen sent a letter dated July 13 to the three-judge 
panel, recommending that Fiske not be appointed independent counsel. Among 
those signing the letter were Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), 
Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) and Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach). 
</P>
<P>
 "Starr is a real Republican, and he'll give us a real investigation," Dornan 
said. "Republicans will have to accept whatever comes out of the Ken Starr 
deal." 
</P>
<P>
 The court's order does not explicitly empower Starr to re-examine the death of 
Foster as Fiske's charter did but it does give him authority to investigate any 
future allegations that the Administration might have tried to interfere with 
the Whitewater criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans also objected to the role that Fiske played in helping Democrats 
delay until next year congressional hearings into central allegations in the 
Whitewater case and to the deference that he has shown for the Clintons, the 
Foster family and others ensnared in the controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to the court's decision, Fiske, a prominent New York attorney, 
issued a statement saying that it had been a privilege to serve as independent 
counsel. "I wish Ken Starr the very best," he said, "and will do everything I 
can to help him with a speedy and orderly transition." 
</P>
<P>
 Starr, who was attending an American Bar Assn. meeting in New Orleans, could 
not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Atty. Gen. Janet Reno had asked the court to reappoint Fiske, the 
judges said they had concluded that to choose an investigator favored by the 
Administration "would not be consistent with the purposes" of the newly 
re-enacted law providing for independent investigations of alleged crimes 
involving the President or his top appointees. The independent counsel law was 
re-enacted earlier this year and signed into law by Clinton on June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "This reflects no conclusion on the part of the court that Fiske lacks either 
the actual independence or any other attribute necessary to the conclusion of 
the investigation," the judges wrote. "Rather, the court reaches this 
conclusion because the act contemplates an apparent as well as an actual 
independence on the part of the counsel. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "As Fiske was appointed by the incumbent Administration, the court therefore 
deems it in the best interest of the appearance of independence contemplated by 
the act that a person not affiliated with the incumbent Administration be 
appointed." 
</P>
<P>
 For those same reasons, Reno initially resisted Republican demands for an 
Administration-appointed prosecutor on grounds that, lacking a law giving him 
the independence of being a court appointee, his findings would never be fully 
accepted by Clinton's critics. But she eventually yielded to the pressure and 
selected Fiske. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, she recalled that she had hoped the independent counsel law would 
be re-enacted earlier, before she was forced to appoint a Whitewater 
investigator. She said she recommended that the court reappoint Fiske to ensure 
"no delays or loss of continuity." 
</P>
<P>
 The court invested Starr with the "full power, independent authority and 
jurisdiction to investigate to the maximum extent authorized" by the new law 
possible violations of law relating to the relationship of the Clintons and 
McDougal and his now-defunct savings and loan.

IRVINE CO.-EL TORO SWAP GAINS; CONVERSION: SUPPORT SWELLS FOR PROPOSED LAND 
DEAL THAT WOULD GIVE DEVELOPER CONTROL OF BASE -- AND OPENING TO BUILD AN 
AIRPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN JOHNSON, This story was reported by Times staff writers Eric Bailey, 
Faye Fiore, Kevin Johnson, Gebe Martinez and H.G. Reza and written by Johnson. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With stunning consensus, environmental and political support swelled Friday 
for an enormous land swap that would give the Irvine Co. control of El Toro 
Marines Corp Air Station, amid growing speculation that the developer wants to 
build a commercial airport there. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Co. officials pledged, however, that the real estate giant is 
"absolutely neutral" on whether the base would become a commercial airport 
under the proposed land exchange that would give the federal government 
thousands of acres of environmentally sensitive land near the Cleveland 
National Forest, including the areas of Weir and Gypsum canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 The land-exchange idea, first proposed by local environmental groups to the 
U.S. Department of the Interior months ago as a way to preserve sensitive open 
space, is rapidly winning favor countywide as a way to spur a planning and 
development process mired in political controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd always hoped that we could do the best for the county; maybe now I'll get 
my wish," said Thomas F. Riley, chairman of the Orange County Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there seemed to be widespread support Friday for pursuing the 
land-exchange concept, some cautioned local leaders against moving too fast. 
Some South County officials, for instance, said they will insist on a voice in 
any El Toro development -- no matter who owns it. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Interior officials -- and the Irvine Co. itself -- stressed that 
they are a long way from an agreement and pointed out that such a pact might 
take years to clear a series of legal and governmental hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a year, the Marine base has been at the center of a raging 
debate over how the 4,700-acre property should be converted to civilian use 
when it closes by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 And until now, the Irvine Co. has remained silent in the controversy which has 
literally divided the county, pitting airport proponents in the north against 
those in South County who are seeking an alternate development plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But by Friday, there was general agreement within the business and government 
communities that a successful land swap with the Interior Department would 
almost certainly favor the creation of a new commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Local developer Buck Johns, who is leading a November ballot measure to win 
approval for a future airport at the base, said the influential Irvine Co.'s 
joining the fray could only help his cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to stand back and ask what would enhance the value of the property 
already owned by the Irvine Co. around the airport," Johns said. "The answer to 
that is an airport." 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging their interest in the land-exchange idea, Irvine Co. 
executives said Friday they were "absolutely neutral" on the question of 
airport development should they gain control of the base. 
</P>
<P>
 However, one federal official familiar with the discussions said he believed 
the Irvine Co. was interested in using the property as a commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that's what they had in mind," the official said. "Every time we 
started going down that route (talks about a possible airport site), I said, 
'Stop. No. That's for somebody else to decide.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co. has continued to describe its discussions with the Interior 
Department as "conceptual," but federal officials confirmed Friday that similar 
deals have been reached in other parts of the nation where military bases have 
been scheduled for closure. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's gained is long-term conservation for the county and open space for 
residents in exchange for the development of an area that is already 
developed," said Jay Ziegler, the spokesman for the Interior Department and one 
of several federal officials who visited Orange County to look over the base. 
</P>
<P>
 If such a deal could be worked out, officials said, all three entities would 
gain: the Marines could get out of El Toro more quickly; the Irvine Co. would 
get some valuable Orange County property and the Interior Department would 
secure another parcel of land it considers crucial to the endangered 
gnatcatcher's survival near the Cleveland National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Hunt, Irvine Co. executive vice president of corporate and legal affairs, 
said the talks have not yet determined how much of the base could be obtained 
or exactly what parcels the Interior Department would like in exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of this has been promoted by the environmental community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunt estimated that such a deal could take two years to complete but cautioned 
that the company had not made any commitment to a proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, there are a lot of environmentally sensitive lands in the north, 
and if those can be preserved by the government that would be a positive 
thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Connie Spenger, president of Friends of Tecate Cypress, said the environmental 
group has been working with the Sierra Club, the Tri-County Conservation 
League, Wilderness Society and other organizations to push the land swap. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Spenger said, her group sent a letter to the Irvine Co. proposing 
the swap and spelling out the benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 In subsequent discussions, the group suggested trading a 10,000-acre swath of 
terrain in the Santa Ana Mountains, next to the Cleveland National Forest, for 
a portion of the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana Mountains terrain features a mix of rare Tecate cypress, oak 
woodlands and coastal sage. It is also home to numerous species of wildlife, 
including prairie falcons. There is also a rare golden eagle nesting site 
within the area. 
</P>
<P>
 In return for the wilderness property, the group proposed that the Irvine Co. 
acquire 3,500 acres of the 4,700-acre base. The remaining 1,200 acres is 
sensitive bird habitat that environmentalists hope will remain open space. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this trade is a good possibility," Spenger said. "I think it's 
something many people in Orange County want. They'd rather have an 
environmental benefit come out of the base closure." 
</P>
<P>
 While local environmentalists are being credited with pushing the land-swap 
arrangement, the idea stems from a concept Interior officials have been working 
on for about six months: the trading of bases that are destined to be closed 
for environmentally sensitive land that would otherwise be developed. 
</P>
<P>
 The bases -- scores of which are now being abandoned -- would be turned over 
to private companies for development in exchange for land that Interior 
believes would be better preserved. 
</P>
<P>
 One example of such an arrangement in process is at March Air Force Base in 
Riverside, where Interior officials are working to swap 2,000 acres on the base 
that is low-grade habitat for the Stephens kangaroo rat in exchange for a 
higher-grade habitat off base that would be preserved. 
</P>
<P>
 Ziegler said federal and state government officials have begun to identify 
areas in Orange and San Diego counties for preservation that are gnatcatcher 
habitats. 
</P>
<P>
 Those reserves are still under design, but the Irvine Co. has substantial 
holdings in some gnatcatcher territory, including the area bordering the 
Cleveland National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Toro base closure office first received official word of the Interior 
Department's interest in a letter signed by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt 
dated June 1. 
</P>
<P>
 In the letter to Defense Secretary William J. Perry, Babbitt said his agency 
had identified numerous military bases it would like to acquire. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station and the neighboring Tustin Marine 
Corps Air Station were included on the list of bases that could be swapped for 
parklands. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tustin base conversion committee -- separate from the agency set up to 
plan El Toro's future -- already has proposed that the Interior Department set 
aside one of its historic blimp hangars and 85 acres for parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Ciesla, base coordinator at El Toro, said the air station might have been 
added to that list based on an early inquiry from a regional Native American 
group that has not followed up with any specific proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Ciesla also said the Interior Department has not submitted a specific 
application for the proposed land swap, but the agency has until Dec. 1 to make 
its bid. 
</P>
<P>
 The official notification of the agency's interest in the base was described 
by Ciesla as a "get your foot in the door" letter. "They said they are 
interested, based on local community requests they received." 
</P>
<P>
 An official close to the Irvine Co. said that the land-exchange plan was not 
given a high priority until company officials recognized the opportunity to 
control a master plan of the entire area. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Defense Department's base closure law, federal agencies get the 
first chance to claim military base property scheduled for closure. 
</P>
<P>
 A Washington-based attorney who specializes in this area of federal law, but 
who did not want to be identified, said that land swaps like the one now under 
consideration in Orange County have occurred in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 But federal officials said it is unlikely that the plan would go through 
unless the community is in agreement. The secretary of the Navy also would have 
to sign off on such a land exchange before it could be implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Department officials left open the possibility that special 
legislation might be required in order to turn the base over to a private 
landowner. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, former Irvine Mayor Larry Agran may have been the first to 
publicly float the idea of a land exchange involving El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 In a commentary published by The Times Orange County Edition in early 
February, Agran suggested that the Irvine Co. deed "thousands of acres of its 
agricultural land" to the federal government which would then be placed in 
trust, "ensuring that much of Orange County's remaining agricultural open space 
would be permanently preserved, forever free of development." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Agran's plan, the government would then give the developer control of El 
Toro, on the condition that there be no commercial airport development. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday, as news of the possible land swap spread throughout the business 
community, prospects for a second Orange County airport seemed to gain 
momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 Local developers and real estate experts hailed the possibility as a "win-win" 
situation for the Irvine Co., which could exchange hard-to-develop properties 
for valuable land adjacent to its flagship investment, the Irvine Spectrum. An 
expansive business park, the Spectrum has grown from 250 companies with 2,500 
employees in 1984 to nearly 2,000 companies with more than 32,000 employees 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think an airport, although they won't admit it, is what they want to see 
there," said Jeffrey W. Cole, president of the National Assn. of Office and 
Industrial Properties local chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 Possibilities for an airport become even more attractive when considering how 
difficult residential development would be in light of the toxic contamination 
of the base, said Jeff Meyers, head of a Newport Beach real estate consulting 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the toxic cleanup they would need to do, we wouldn't see any housing 
development there in our lifetime," he said. "This site is no cake-walk, but if 
anyone can develop it, it's the Irvine Co." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, the task of planning for the civilian conversion of El Toro 
has been left up to a specially created intergovernmental agency called the El 
Toro Reuse Planning Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 But from the start, the planning process has been fraught with political 
controversy, mostly pitting South County interests against North County's. It 
took months for officials to even settle on the geographic configuration of the 
agency's nine-member governing board. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the trouble, those involved in planning the agency seemed hesitant to 
abandon its mission to present an acceptable conversion plan to the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 But should the land swap be approved, Riley said, it was possible that there 
might be no further use for the agency. At that point, he said, land planning 
authority should be handled by the county Board of Supervisors, since it 
already regulates development of all unincorporated property in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Miller, director of the consulting firm working for the El Toro Reuse 
Planning Authority, was disappointed that the authority -- the agency 
responsible for producing an acceptable development plan for the Marine base -- 
had been "left out of the loop" in the land-swap discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 One federal official called the idea the makings of "a scam," suggesting that 
the Irvine Co. was giving away virtually worthless gnatcatcher habitat that 
would be difficult to develop in exchange for prime land in the heart of Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest Mayor Marcia Rudolph, who opposes a civilian airport at El Toro, 
said she did not think Irvine Co. ownership of El Toro would derail the 
intergovernmental planning process. 
</P>
<P>
 The authority "is going to be integrally involved in the whole thing. The 
Department of Defense has recognized it as the official reuse planning agency," 
said Rudolph. "Remember, it's just ownership that's changing, not use." 
</P>
<P>
 There is also disagreement over how a land exchange would affect the November 
election to determine whether an airport should be built on the property. Some 
believe that a ballot initiative would not govern private property. 
</P>
<P>
 But James E. Erickson, a local land use authority attorney who previously 
worked on the issue, said the ballot measure would have an impact. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative, if approved, would require the county to zone 2,000 acres for 
commercial airport use. That zoning requirement would apply to whoever owns the 
land, Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 That could become important since both federal and local officials believe a 
land swap could not be completed by Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very intriguing scenario," County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said 
Friday. "This thing (land-swap proposal) has come over the hill rather quickly. 
I don't how fast this train is going down the track." Let's Make a Deal 
</P>
<P>
 The future of El Toro Marine Corps Air Station is one of the most hotly 
debated issues in Orange County. Environmentalists propose that the Irvine Co. 
swap 10,000 acres of undeveloped land bordering Cleveland National Forest to 
the U.S. government for 3,500 acres of the El Toro base. 
</P>
<P>
 Who Benefits 
</P>
<P>
 * Interior Department: Undeveloped land is preserved for public use; expands 
half-million acre Cleveland National Forest 
</P>
<P>
 * Irvine Co.: Would have major influence over El Toro reuse plans after its 
closure 
</P>
<P>
 Top Three Scenarios 
</P>
<P>
 Since the base closure was announced in 1993, several reuse ideas have 
emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 * Airport: John Wayne Airport has two problems. It moves no air cargo and is 
approaching its limit of 8.4 million passengers a year. An El Toro airport 
would provide-much needed relief to businesses, including Federal Express and 
United Parcel Service. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mass transit center: Buses, van-pools, taxis and commuter trains would be 
linked through Orange County Transit Authority. Plan calls for only 100 acres. 
Could be implemented with or without airport. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prison: Two security facilities would house more than 2,000 low- and 
minimum-level security prisoners. Plan calls for only 155 acres. Proposed by 
U.S. Bureau of Prisons.

PROPOSED EL TORO LAND SWAP; Q&A; LATEST TWISTS, NEXT STEPS IN BASE CONVERSION 
BATTLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Political and business leaders have haggled over how to convert the El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station to civilian use. An intergovernmental agency was 
formed to consider options, and on Nov. 8 voters will decide a ballot 
initiative that would require part of the base to be zoned for a commercial 
airport. This week, the county's largest land developer suddenly became a major 
player in the process. Here are some key questions and answers. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What is the latest development? 
</P>
<P>
 A. The Irvine Co. is discussing with the U.S. Department of the Interior the 
possibility of a land swap. Under a plan proposed by environmentalists, the 
Irvine Co. would trade 10,000 acres of wilderness near the Cleveland National 
Forest in northeast Orange County for the 4,700-acre military base. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. If the trade can be worked out, what happens to the military base? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Although the Irvine Co. has declined to spell out what it would do with the 
land, business leaders believe that the developer would prefer a commercial 
airport at the site, to complement plans for its 3,600-acre industrial business 
park, Irvine Spectrum, located just north of the base. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Who ultimately decides what happens to the base? 
</P>
<P>
 A. The U.S. Department of Defense will make the decision but prefers to have 
local leaders come to a consensus on a plan. If the Interior Department wants 
the land, and is willing to make the Irvine Co. swap, the Defense Department 
can convey the land to the Interior Department and the swap could be made. Some 
say special federal legislation would be needed for the trade to be made with a 
private developer; others disagree, saying precedent has been set in other 
swaps of this nature. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How soon could all of this happen? 
</P>
<P>
 A. The Department of Interior has to state its intent to take the base by Dec. 
1. The base is scheduled to close by 1999, but the Marines are hoping to be out 
by 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Will residents of Orange County have a say? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Regardless of what happens, a countywide referendum to decide whether an 
airport should be permitted on the property will still appear on the November 
ballot. It is unclear how the proposed land swap would affect that. Some 
believe the ballot initiative would have no impact on governing the use of 
private property. Others say that if voters decide the base should be turned 
into an airport, the county is bound by that vote.

PROPOSED EL TORO LAND SWAP; GRASS-ROOTS GROUP HITS PAYDIRT AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOREEN CARVAJAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 The philosophy of the Friends of Tecate Cypress is as tough as its namesake -- 
gnarled trees that flourish in the dry, steep slopes below the Santa Ana 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 "Success," said Connie Spenger, president of the small band of Orange County 
conservationists, "is failure turned inside out." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, the small grass-roots organization was reveling in the latest triumph 
over failure. With a three-page letter, the group had prompted the Irvine Co. 
to seriously consider the notion to swap a 10,000-acre swath of territory in 
the Santa Ana Mountains for 3,500 acres of the 4,700-acre El Toro Marine Corps 
Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 "The logic of this deal is obvious," said David Kossack, vice president of the 
group, who noted that it would be far easier to develop the El Toro land than 
the steep terrain of the Santa Ana Mountains. "I think the most constructive 
criticism that we've got about this is that it's too reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
 Kossack, a Santa Ana environmental consultant with a doctorate in genetics, is 
part of a small core of activists who have made the Friends a force despite a 
visible lack of cash, staff and headquarters. About four people run the group, 
turning to 150 or so supporters who contribute as needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tecate cypress tree gave the organization its roots; it formed informally 
in the 1980s to stop a shooting range in a cypress grove. The group 
incorporated in 1988 and the Friends relied on gentle persuasion and -- 
occasionally -- lawsuits to press their efforts to preserve the Santa Anas. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the Friends and other conservation groups successfully persuaded an 
Orange County developer to sell the state nearly 1,000 acres of expensive land 
in Coal Canyon that contains one of the last remaining Tecate cypress forests. 
</P>
<P>
 But they didn't have the same luck in the courts with lawsuits against the 
Eastern toll road, a Hon Development project in Coal Canyon and an Irvine Co. 
development in adjacent Gypsum Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Spenger said she can't even remember how they came up with their latest idea 
for a land swap to preserve part of the Santa Ana mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something that's been on my mind for a long time," said Spenger, a 
Fullerton housewife who helped develop the idea with Kossack and a Santa Ana 
carpenter named Gordon Russer. "Those canyons are just so fantastic. They're 
great habitats, and way back in the '30s hikers used to go there to see the 
sandstone formations and the babbling brooks. You have fresh air, long vistas 
and a long way to stretch."

U.S. ECONOMY GROWS DESPITE JOBLESS RATE RISE; BUSINESS: THE NUMBERS MASK A 
SIZABLE GAIN IN EMPLOYMENT THAT HAS RAISED INFLATION FEARS. FED COULD HIKE 
INTEREST RATES AGAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The nation's unemployment rate edged up to 6.1% in July from 6% in June, the 
government reported Friday, but the slight rise masked a vigorous gain in 
employment that ignited investor fears of renewed inflation and raised the odds 
of the Federal Reserve Board boosting interest rates again. 
</P>
<P>
 California's jobless rate climbed more sharply, rising to 9% last month from 
8.3%, as the state's sluggish economy continued to lag behind the nation and 
produced skimpy job increases. In Los Angeles County, the unemployment rate was 
10%, down from 10.1% in June. 
</P>
<P>
 June's unemployment rate for Orange County -- the most recent figure available 
-- was 5.8%, up slightly from 5.4% in May as scores of teachers and high school 
and college graduates added their names to the list of job hunters in the 
county. Except for Los Angeles, monthly rates for the state's counties are 
usually issued on the third Friday of the following month, so July figures for 
Orange County are expected at the end of next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, analysts and investors focused on a stronger-than-expected gain of 
259,000 jobs last month in the closely watched survey of employer payrolls. 
Also suggesting robust economic growth were increases in both average hourly 
and weekly earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 The job gain is "a very healthy increase and what it says is that businesses 
are still catching up with the fact that they didn't do any hiring for so 
long," said Cynthia Latta, an economist with the consulting firm of 
DRI/McGraw-Hill in Lexington, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 But Latta, echoing concerns on Wall Street about the prospects for inflation, 
said "there's got to be pressure out there pretty soon in the job market for 
higher wages." 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street over the past week had focused on reports suggesting that the 
nation's 3-year-old economic recovery was slowing slightly. Consequently, 
investors began anticipating that the Federal Reserve would not raise interest 
rates soon. But based on today's reports, investors "changed their minds 
again," Latta said, and turned their attention to the Fed's upcoming Aug. 16 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Bond prices fell more than one point, pushing up yields on 30-year Treasury 
bonds to 7.54% from 7.4% late Thursday. The Dow Jones industrial average 
dropped 18.77 points to close at 3,747.02. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, employers have added a hefty 2 million jobs to their 
payrolls, a strong surge that is encouraging more people to enter the labor 
force. One side effect of the influx of job hunters, though, was the jobless 
rate rose last month even as many new jobs were being generated. 
</P>
<P>
 During July, the economy showed its biggest gains in services and retail 
trade, with restaurants, supermarkets and furniture stores all reporting 
increases. More workers also were added by temporary employment agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton proclaimed that "the future looks good," alluding to 
employment figures during a Rose Garden ceremony marking the first anniversary 
of Congress' passage of his deficit-reduction program. 
</P>
<P>
 California's jobless rate remained the highest among the 11 big states whose 
employment figures were released Friday. North Carolina posted the lowest rate, 
4.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the relatively small sampling on which the state figures are based, 
California's jobless rates often are volatile. And even with last month's 
increase to 9%, it remains well below the 9.6% rate in April and the 1994 high 
of 10.1% in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists generally considered the state employment figures mediocre, but 
there was enough ambiguity in the statistics for varying interpretations -- 
particularly by politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Gov. Pete Wilson called the increase in the jobless rate a 
"temporary statistical variation" caused in part by seasonal forces, such as 
students entering the job market. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wilson's Democratic opponent in the Nov. 8 election, state Treasurer 
Kathleen Brown, said the disparity in figures nationally and for the state 
indicated to her that California "continues to be a drag" on the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to tell you I don't see it as a recovery," she said in an address in 
Long Beach to a group of women business executives. 
</P>
<P>
 The payroll survey showed a gain of 8,100 jobs in California during July, 
mainly in services and manufacturing. On the other hand, employment in retail 
and whole trade was down 3,500, and small declines were posted in three other 
industrial categories. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Gibson, an economist for the state Department of Finance, said other 
economic indicators show that the state's actually is doing better than 
Friday's employment figures suggest. 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed to strong gains recently in the state's retail sales and payroll 
taxes, along with the continued strength of the housing market despite recent 
increases in home mortgage rates. "We're moving ahead," he said. "Not as 
rapidly as we'd like, but we're moving ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Friday's figures included downward revisions in job totals 
for both May and June. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, even with the job increase in July, the latest figures show 
California's employment as being down 8,100 over the last three months since 
April and up only 6,800 since the end of last year. By some estimates, the 
state's job total is still down by more than 800,000 since employment peaked in 
mid-1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County's figures -- which, unlike the federal and state statistics 
are not adjusted for seasonal trends -- showed employment rising by 7,000 in 
July to just over 4 million. The number of unemployed fell by 2,000 to 446,000.

BEEN THERE, DONE THAT; THE CALL SINGER, IN O.C. TONIGHT, REACHED WAY BACK TO 
LIFT '80S FOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 There's a standard joke in films about floundering athletic teams that need 
resuscitation, inwhich the new coach confronts his unpromising troops and 
decides to start with plainest basics: "Gentlemen, this is a basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Been's rock 'n' roll career wasn't necessarily on a losing streak at 
the end of 1990, but his band, the Call, was exhausted after years on the road 
and needed a break. Been, who had felt generally uninspired by the musical 
climate of the 1980s, decided that he needed to recharge his musical spirits by 
going back to the plainest basics he had learned when he was 9 or 10 years old. 
For Been, who plays tonight at the Coach House, music began with the Beatles 
and the Rolling Stones, the Yardbirds and Moby Grape. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got my vinyl records out, the things that first really, really excited me," 
Been recalled recently over the phone from a tour stop in Denver. "I needed a 
new inspiration that I wasn't really finding in current music. I was trying to 
recapture a lot of those first feelings. Not to go back and make a '60s record, 
but to go back and fall in love again." 
</P>
<P>
 Been's sessions with his turntable seem to have helped. His first solo album, 
"On the Verge of a Nervous Breakthrough," is full of crunchy rock vigor and 
high-reaching lyricism. Released in April, the album offers plenty of fun for 
listeners who like to play the name-that-influence game. Isn't that a hybrid of 
Muddy Waters and U2's groove-oriented "Achtung Baby" style on "Us," the leadoff 
track? Is that Cream or Canned Heat or Norman Greenbaum's "Spirit in the Sky" 
he's quoting in "This World" (or maybe all three)?  
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere one detects a Doorsy touch here, a glimmer of Pink Floyd there, some 
husky Springsteenian emoting on the lament "Worried." On "This Way," a lean, 
sinewy and anxious momentum pays obvious homage to another of Been's favorites, 
Joy Division. In the middle of it all is a cover of the Yardbirds hit "For Your 
Love." It's one of rock's mustiest bar-band oldies, but Been gives it the kind 
of juice that shakes off the dust and makes you hear the song afresh as an epic 
statement of high romanticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Been said his new record company, Qwest/Reprise, had originally expected an 
album by the Call, which had turned out seven albums from 1982 to 1990. The 
Call had gained extensive album-rock play for such songs as "Everywhere I Go," 
"I Still Believe" and "The Walls Came Down," winning a reliable following on 
the national club circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Call taking a break, Been spent 1991 working on his first film score, 
for the Paul Schrader-directed "Light Sleeper" (Been says he got the gig in 
unlikely fashion: Schrader got turned on to the Call by a favorable review in 
Playboy magazine, written by Chris Hillman, the former Byrds, Flying Burrito 
Brothers and Desert Rose Band member).  
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Been resumed recording with two other Call founders, drummer Scott 
Musick and guitarist Tom Ferrier (a fourth member, keyboard player Jim Goodwin, 
had left, citing road-weariness). But the new songs sounded sufficiently 
different to merit a new designation as solo works by Been, who had been the 
Call's singer and songwriter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did it as a solo record, rather than live up to or down to anybody's 
expectations," Been said. "I didn't want to disappoint people who expected a 
Call record, and I wanted to play with other people. (Calling it a Michael Been 
album) allowed a bit more freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 For one track, Been recruited Hugo Burnham and Dave Allen, the original rhythm 
section of one of his favorite bands, Gang of Four. Ralph Patlan, a guitarist 
Been had met in Texas during a Call tour, played a prominent part, and has 
joined Musick and Ferrier in a touring lineup behind the bass-playing Been 
(whose name rhymes with "seen"). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Unchanged from Been's Call period are his lyrical themes, which are full of 
self-examination and yearning for some sort of transcendent connection between 
lovers, or between the earthly and the eternal. 
</P>
<P>
 Been, whose twangy Western accent reflects his childhood roots in Oklahoma 
City, says he knew by age 7 he wanted to be a musician. The family moved to 
Illinois when he was 12. He went to college there, but left to follow his 
musical calling. Been headed to California, where the Call came together in 
Santa Cruz in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was 19, Been married his college sweetheart, Carol. Their only child, 
Robert, was born a few years later, around the time the band started. Keeping a 
family and a rock career together "hasn't been easy, but I've managed to do 
it," said the rocker, who now lives in Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 "My wife has her own career going (as a psychotherapist), and that's the 
reason it has worked. It's really rough for a musician to be married if your 
wife doesn't have her own vision of her own life. If she lives through her 
husband and is constantly waiting for him to come home, it doesn't work. 
(Music) is a self-absorbing kind of occupation." 
</P>
<P>
 Been is thoughtful about the spiritual element in his music, which for a time 
even won the Call some attention in Christian-rock circles. Been said a good 
deal of that following fell away, however, after he took an acting role as one 
of Jesus' disciples in "The Last Temptation of Christ." Director Martin 
Scorcese's controversial merger of deep spirituality and imaginative 
speculation made for an excellent film, but it found no friends in conservative 
religious quarters where anything but a literal reading of the Bible was 
shunned as blasphemy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was raised in the South, and (Christianity) permeates your life pretty 
seriously down there," Been said. "When I was younger, I rejected it all 
because of the obvious hypocrisies and obvious pettiness and orthodoxies. As 
you grow older, some of the things that weren't so obvious kind of stay with 
you. It's a struggle to figure out what was a lie about it, and what was true 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "My particular spirituality isn't too much based on some kind of cosmic 
relationship. It isn't all walking on air, up in the clouds and looking for 
answers or inspiration in some kind of otherworldly thing. The spiritual aspect 
of life usually comes to me through people. It's pretty much acted out in 
relation with other people. I think there's a point to it all. I can't really 
figure out what it is, but as corny as it is, I know it has something to do 
with love, something to do with (reaching) outside ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Been's songs examine both connections achieved, and potential connections 
short-circuited by human fallibility. It's all played out with Been's 
characteristic emotional fervor and big-scale intensity of feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "When those feelings are expressed, they seem to be huge, but they're only 
huge because of the cultural situation we're in, which is so blank," Been said. 
"Most of us, including me, spend most of our time pretty unfeeling, pretty 
repressed. You're really happy, sitting in a nice house, watching television 
and eating your dinner, and you see this stuff on Rwanda or Bosnia. How could 
you finish your meal if you were really connected to all your feelings? I think 
something's really wrong when I realize I can. There's got to be some 
incredible numbness in my life, that I can shut down those feelings and go on. 
People take as much as they can, and when they find they can't take any more, 
they turn off. You shut down vast portions of yourself in order to survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the television network's satellite dish is the new tree of knowledge, 
claiming the innocence of beholders who are forced into numbness in the face of 
horror. But Been sees possibility and challenge in our current state. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is in some way the greatness of the times we live in. It isn't possible 
to be ignorant any more. Now we have to take some kind of responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 At 38, Been is starting to think about helping along a new generation of 
musicians. His son, now 15, makes his recording debut playing bass on one track 
from "Nervous Breakthrough," and Been says it's obvious he is going to make his 
way in music. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've helped him along, but he's definitely gifted. I think it's already in 
the cards, he's definitely going to be a musician. His grades went down, all 
the telltale signs. I'm not concerned with his mathematics grade or how well 
he's doing in Spanish -- it doesn't seem to matter. The people I feel the most 
compassion for are the people who are 19, 20 or older and don't know what to 
get into. That's a terrible place to be, if you don't have a vision of your 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Been says he doesn't envision working too closely with his son.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's so good that it would be much better if he was on his own. He doesn't 
need me."  
</P>
<P>
 But Been hopes to work as a mentor-producer with other young musicians, 
"finding guys who are 20 years old, and helping them avoid all the mistakes. 
I'd like to be able to take some band the shortest distance between two points, 
rather than these ridiculous detours (in the music business) that can be 
calamitous." 
</P>
<P>
 Been offers this bit of free mentoring for those who might be able to use it: 
"Too many bands are too greatly affected by their influences. I think it's 
great to have a lot of influences, so you can take from each one but come out 
with something that's your own. If you are too much in love with one band, it's 
a disaster musically. You lose yourself." 
</P>

POP MUSIC REVIEW; JAMES INGRAM SPEAKS UP FOR LOVE AND MUSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James Ingram was being metaphorical Thursday night at the Coach House when he 
posed the question "How Do You Keep the Music Playing?" 
</P>
<P>
 The song, a hit from the pop-soul balladeer's 1983 debut album, anxiously 
surveys the barriers and pitfalls that make it difficult for love to endure. In 
literal terms, though, Ingram seems to have found a sure-fire way to keep the 
music playing. When he reached points in his show where mere speech would 
suffice for most performers, this rich-voiced songbird instead improvised tunes 
of his own and warbled or crooned whatever he had to communicate. 
</P>
<P>
 Those sung asides put some needed spice into a 90-minute performance that had 
to overcome the common problem of the '80s and '90s vintage pop-soul crooner: 
smooth, urbane, generic material that isn't even a faint echo of the great soul 
and R & B hits of the '60s and pre-disco '70s. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingram emerged as a protege of producer Quincy Jones in the early '80s, taking 
a featured role on Jones' Grammy-festooned album, "The Dude." Jones also 
included Ingram on the "We Are the World" session and involved him in Michael 
Jackson's mega-selling "Thriller" album as the co-writer (with Jones) of 
Jackson's hit "P.Y.T. (Pretty Young Thing)." 
</P>
<P>
 Ingram has since been heard most widely as the leading man on romantic duets 
such as "Baby, Come to Me" (with Patti Austin) and "Somewhere Out There" (the 
theme from "An American Tail" that he sang with Linda Ronstadt). 
</P>
<P>
 Those ardor-filled hits, and others like them, made up the gist of Ingram's 
show, but some of the most memorable moments came during impromptu asides, 
moments when other performers wouldn't even have bothered to sing. 
</P>
<P>
 Spotting an old friend in the audience, Ingram started singing instead of 
chatting. An inquiry (how long would the Tokyo-based pal be in town?) and a 
request (leave your phone number) were melodiously made. The buddy, Ronnie 
Rucker, held up his end of the conversation by singing his answers into 
Ingram's outstretched microphone.  
</P>
<P>
 After the show, Rucker explained that he and Ingram became friends years ago 
when they both played in the Coasters' backup band and that their musical chat 
wasn't prearranged. 
</P>
<P>
 Not content to reserve his chivalrous, modern-day Galahad's ardor for the 
women in his ballads, Ingram at one point could be heard crooning his affection 
to a red plastic cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "This water tastes so good," he sang, turning to the drum riser where the cup 
rested as if it were the altar in a temple of Venus. "Baby, I need you, you let 
me be my best. . . . I love you." Can water swoon? 
</P>
<P>
 One of the pleasant things about Ingram's style is that while his romantic cup 
is surely full, it doth not runneth over. In a field where singers tend to gush 
forth in showy demonstrations of vocal gymnastics, Ingram sticks to the song at 
hand. He applied note-stretching filigree judiciously, not needing histrionics 
to impress with a superb range that went from mellifluous cooing on high notes 
commonly associated with screeching cats, to firm and manly chest-tones in 
moments that called for a lover's declaration of deep sincerity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As a ballad singer, Ingram was at his best in "There's No Easy Way" and "I 
Don't Have the Heart," two troubled songs that let him play the role of a nice 
guy who would never deliberately break a lover's heart, but, romance being an 
unruly and unkind thing, is placed in circumstances where heartbreak is 
inevitable. Those were nicely dramatic; most of the rest was insubstantial by 
comparison, and the unbroken succession of smooth mid-tempo songs and ballads 
brought on a sense of sameness. 
</P>
<P>
 Ingram's nine-member band included three female backup singers who divvied up, 
with uneven results, the duet-partner roles required for three of the songs 
from his hit discography. Also on hand was keyboards player Kiki Ebsen, the 
daughter of Buddy Ebsen, who spent her childhood in Newport Beach and now makes 
a living as a touring player for various pop stars. The band's playing was 
polite and characterless, until Ingram got that old-time soul religion and 
brought the show home with some welcome and satisfying heat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yah Mo Be There," an urgent plea for God's help in the face of troubles, hit 
with a hefty beat and persuasive urgency. Then came the encore, a cover of Ray 
Charles' "In the Heat of the Night" that shucked off the evening's dominant 
contemporary sheen and got down to sweaty soul fundamentals. The backup singers 
testified; the band cooked, and Ingram sang his way right off the stage and up 
the dressing room steps.  
</P>
<P>
 It was too little of the real stuff, but it wasn't too late to leave the 
audience with an energized buzz. 
</P>
<P>
 The opening singer, Cathy Cornell, joked early in her set that when she 
arrived in California from her native Oklahoma, her expectations of stardom 
were so high that she named her dog Grammy. Many years later, Cornell's 
expectations remain unfulfilled: The song she was introducing was called "Life 
Ain't What It's Supposed 2-B," which is also the title of her do-it-yourself 
debut CD. But the thirtysomething singer's often-striking performance suggested 
that her disappointments have been due to a lack of breaks rather than of 
talent. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornell was full of confidence as she played to a house that included many of 
her fans. Accompanying herself on a digital piano, she displayed a clear, 
strong voice that recalled Bonnie Raitt on sassier material, and a 
tawny-sounding Christine McVie on a couple of yearning ballads (one of them, 
"Will You Stay Forever Song," was the show's highlight). 
</P>
<P>
 Cornell could power her way through an emotive chorus, but she sang not to 
show off, but to get her meanings across, creating an almost conversational 
tone with her phrasing. 
</P>
<P>
 On her album, Cornell goes for a mid-'70s Southern California rock sound, with 
some nice country touches supplied by pedal steel guitar. The country hues 
didn't come through in the solo performance, but her songs still came across 
well. They were simple and direct, not striking works of imagination, but the 
kinds of songs that reinforce familiar sentiments honestly, believably and 
without resorting to cliche.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One of Cornell's most appealing qualities is her ability to sing about sex in 
a candid, refreshingly frank way. Those songs never sound tawdry because they 
ring true to life rather than projecting fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
 Cornell made one big mistake in concert by playing along with a recorded 
instrumental track from her album on the set-closing R & B song "Fallin' Out of 
Love With You." The only purpose in doing it seemed to be to brag about how her 
studio band consists of musicians who are touring pros with the likes of 
Michael McDonald and Rod Stewart. Big deal. Playing to tinny, canned backing, 
Cornell lost the vibrancy and immediacy she had generated just fine on her own.

 To initiate her new duties as music director of the Orange County Chamber 
Orchestra, Diana Halprin will open with an autumn program of Mozart, Beethoven 
and Donizetti. 
</P>
<P>
 Concertmaster of the chamber orchestra since 1987, Halprin took over as 
director in May after founding music director Micah Levy announced he would 
pursue graduate studies at the Peabody Institute of the Johns Hopkins 
University in Baltimore. Halprin will lead all programs except one (Jan. 22), 
which Levy will conduct. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 The Mozart Camerata will expand its 1994-95 season by adding a two-concert 
series on Saturday evenings at the Irvine Barclay Theatre, in addition to its 
usual five programs at St. Andrew's Presbyterian Church in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The season will open at 8 p.m. on Sept. 24 at the Irvine theater with founder 
Ami Porat conducting works by Mozart, Boccherini and Mendelssohn. This program 
will be repeated in Newport Beach at 4 p.m. on Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 The second program at the Irvine theater will be Jan. 14, with the repeat in 
Newport Beach on Jan. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're responding to subscriber requests," Porat said Thursday. "We've had 
substantial demand for (concerts on) Saturday evenings, and the Barclay could 
provide the Saturday dates." 
</P>
<P>
 The Camerata had played concerts in both facilities during the 1990 and 1991 
seasons but had to cancel four Irvine programs in 1991 because of low ticket 
sales there.

<P>
 The additional concerts, which will also be performed at St. Andrew's, will 
boost the annual budget by 10%, to $150,000, according to Porat, who will 
conduct all programs. Series tickets for the two Irvine events are $29 to $69. 
Single tickets will range from $19 to $38. Series tickets for the five programs 
at St. Andrew's are $59 to $99. Single tickets: $14 to $29. Information: (714)

BRADAC MANAGES TO DO GOOD WORKS, EVEN 'IN EXILE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Sweet are the uses of adversity," says the Duke in Shakespeare's "As You Like 
It" after being exiled to the Forest of Arden by his usurping brother. 
</P>
<P>
 We could say the same thing about Thomas Bradac.A few years ago, ousted by the 
board of directors of GroveShakespeare in a surprise power play, Bradac was 
exiled from a company he had founded and that he had kept going for several 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost immediately, he started a new company, Shakespeare Orange County, in 
which he made use of many of the actors from GroveShakespeare and also of the 
Waltmar Theatre on the campus of Chapman University, where he teaches acting 
and directing. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, ironically, the Grove has gone kaput and it is only Bradac's company that 
offers Shakespeare on a regular basis to the culture-starved denizens of Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky for us that Thomas Bradac took his Shakespeare seriously and reacted as 
did the exiled Duke to adversity, which "like the toad, ugly and venomous, 
wears yet a precious jewel in his head." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucky for us in Orange County that we have been given the opportunity to 
continue to participate in the magic of Shakespearean theater.

<P>
 The fact that "Roseanne" was once again snubbed for a best comedy series Emmy 
nomination is good news to those of us who prefer our television comedyon the 
intelligent side ("TV Academy Is Snubbing 'Roseanne,' " July 23). 
</P>
<P>
 The success of such excellent, intelligent shows as "Frasier," "Northern 
Exposure," "Seinfeld" and "Murphy Brown" seems to indicate that once again the 
networks are aiming for our minds instead of the gutter. Keep up the good work.

IRVINE CO.-EL TORO SWAP GAINS; CONVERSION: SUPPORT SWELLS FOR PROPOSED LAND 
DEAL THAT WOULD GIVE DEVELOPER CONTROL OF BASE -- AND OPENING TO BUILD AN 
AIRPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With stunning consensus, environmental and political support swelled Friday 
for an enormous land swap that would give the Irvine Co. control of El Toro 
Marines Corp Air Station, amid growing speculation that the developer wants to 
build a commercial airport there. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Co. officials pledged, however, that the real estate giant is 
"absolutely neutral" on whether the base would become a commercial airport 
under the proposed land exchange that would give the federal government 
thousands of acres of environmentally sensitive land near the Cleveland 
National Forest, including the areas of Weir and Gypsum canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 The land-exchange idea, first proposed by local environmental groups to the 
U.S. Department of the Interior months ago as a way to preserve sensitive open 
space, is rapidly winning favor countywide as a way to spur a planning and 
development process mired in political controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd always hoped that we could do the best for the county; maybe now I'll get 
my wish," said Thomas F. Riley, chairman of the Orange County Board of 
Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there seemed to be widespread support Friday for pursuing the 
land-exchange concept, some cautioned local leaders against moving too fast. 
Some South County officials, for instance, said they will insist on a voice in 
any El Toro development -- no matter who owns it. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Interior officials -- and the Irvine Co. itself -- stressed that 
they are a long way from an agreement and pointed out that such a pact might 
take years to clear a series of legal and governmental hurdles. 
</P>
<P>
 For more than a year, the Marine base has been at the center of a raging 
debate over how the 4,700-acre property should be converted to civilian use 
when it closes by 1999. 
</P>
<P>
 And until now, the Irvine Co. has remained silent in the controversy which has 
literally divided the county, pitting airport proponents in the north against 
those in South County who are seeking an alternate development plan. 
</P>
<P>
 But by Friday, there was general agreement within the business and government 
communities that a successful land swap with the Interior Department would 
almost certainly favor the creation of a new commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Local developer Buck Johns, who is leading a November ballot measure to win 
approval for a future airport at the base, said the influential Irvine Co.'s 
joining the fray could only help his cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to stand back and ask what would enhance the value of the property 
already owned by the Irvine Co. around the airport," Johns said. "The answer to 
that is an airport." 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging their interest in the land-exchange idea, Irvine Co. 
executives said Friday they were "absolutely neutral" on the question of 
airport development should they gain control of the base. 
</P>
<P>
 However, one federal official familiar with the discussions said he believed 
the Irvine Co. was interested in using the property as a commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that's what they had in mind," the official said. "Every time we 
started going down that route (talks about a possible airport site), I said, 
'Stop. No. That's for somebody else to decide.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co. has continued to describe its discussions with the Interior 
Department as "conceptual," but federal officials confirmed Friday that similar 
deals have been reached in other parts of the nation where military bases have 
been scheduled for closure. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's gained is long-term conservation for the county and open space for 
residents in exchange for the development of an area that is already 
developed," said Jay Ziegler, the spokesman for the Interior Department and one 
of several federal officials who visited Orange County to look over the base. 
</P>
<P>
 If such a deal could be worked out, officials said, all three entities would 
gain: the Marines could get out of El Toro more quickly; the Irvine Co. would 
get some valuable Orange County property and the Interior Department would 
secure another parcel of land it considers crucial to the endangered 
gnatcatcher's survival near the Cleveland National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Hunt, Irvine Co. executive vice president of corporate and legal affairs, 
said the talks have not yet determined how much of the base could be obtained 
or exactly what parcels the Interior Department would like in exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of this has been promoted by the environmental community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunt estimated that such a deal could take two years to complete but cautioned 
that the company had not made any commitment to a proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, there are a lot of environmentally sensitive lands in the north, 
and if those can be preserved by the government that would be a positive 
thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Connie Spenger, president of Friends of Tecate Cypress, said the environmental 
group has been working with the Sierra Club, the Tri-County Conservation 
League, Wilderness Society and other organizations to push the land swap. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Spenger said, her group sent a letter to the Irvine Co. proposing 
the swap and spelling out the benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 In subsequent discussions, the group suggested trading a 10,000-acre swath of 
terrain in the Santa Ana Mountains, next to the Cleveland National Forest, for 
a portion of the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 The Santa Ana Mountains terrain features a mix of rare Tecate cypress, oak 
woodlands and coastal sage. It is also home to numerous species of wildlife, 
including prairie falcons. There is also a rare golden eagle nesting site 
within the area. 
</P>
<P>
 In return for the wilderness property, the group proposed that the Irvine Co. 
acquire 3,500 acres of the 4,700-acre base. The remaining 1,200 acres is 
sensitive bird habitat that environmentalists hope will remain open space. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this trade is a good possibility," Spenger said. "I think it's 
something many people in Orange County want. They'd rather have an 
environmental benefit come out of the base closure." 
</P>
<P>
 While local environmentalists are being credited with pushing the land-swap 
arrangement, the idea stems from a concept Interior officials have been working 
on for about six months: the trading of bases that are destined to be closed 
for environmentally sensitive land that would otherwise be developed. 
</P>
<P>
 The bases -- scores of which are now being abandoned -- would be turned over 
to private companies for development in exchange for land that Interior 
believes would be better preserved. 
</P>
<P>
 One example of such an arrangement in process is at March Air Force Base in 
Riverside, where Interior officials are working to swap 2,000 acres on the base 
that is low-grade habitat for the Stephens kangaroo rat in exchange for a 
higher-grade habitat off base that would be preserved. 
</P>
<P>
 Ziegler said federal and state government officials have begun to identify 
areas in Orange and San Diego counties for preservation that are gnatcatcher 
habitats. 
</P>
<P>
 Those reserves are still under design, but the Irvine Co. has substantial 
holdings in some gnatcatcher territory, including the area bordering the 
Cleveland National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Toro base closure office first received official word of the Interior 
Department's interest in a letter signed by Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt 
dated June 1. 
</P>
<P>
 In the letter to Defense Secretary William J. Perry, Babbitt said his agency 
had identified numerous military bases it would like to acquire. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station and the neighboring Tustin Marine 
Corps Air Station were included on the list of bases that could be swapped for 
parklands. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tustin base conversion committee -- separate from the agency set up to 
plan El Toro's future -- already has proposed that the Interior Department set 
aside one of its historic blimp hangars and 85 acres for parkland. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Ciesla, base coordinator at El Toro, said the air station might have been 
added to that list based on an early inquiry from a regional Native American 
group that has not followed up with any specific proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Ciesla also said the Interior Department has not submitted a specific 
application for the proposed land swap, but the agency has until Dec. 1 to make 
its bid. 
</P>
<P>
 The official notification of the agency's interest in the base was described 
by Ciesla as a "get your foot in the door" letter. "They said they are 
interested, based on local community requests they received." 
</P>
<P>
 An official close to the Irvine Co. said that the land-exchange plan was not 
given a high priority until company officials recognized the opportunity to 
control a master plan of the entire area. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Defense Department's base closure law, federal agencies get the 
first chance to claim military base property scheduled for closure. 
</P>
<P>
 A Washington-based attorney who specializes in this area of federal law, but 
who did not want to be identified, said that land swaps like the one now under 
consideration in Orange County have occurred in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 But federal officials said it is unlikely that the plan would go through 
unless the community is in agreement. The secretary of the Navy also would have 
to sign off on such a land exchange before it could be implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Department officials left open the possibility that special 
legislation might be required in order to turn the base over to a private 
landowner. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, former Irvine Mayor Larry Agran may have been the first to 
publicly float the idea of a land exchange involving El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 In a commentary published by The Times Orange County Edition in early 
February, Agran suggested that the Irvine Co. deed "thousands of acres of its 
agricultural land" to the federal government which would then be placed in 
trust, "ensuring that much of Orange County's remaining agricultural open space 
would be permanently preserved, forever free of development." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Agran's plan, the government would then give the developer control of El 
Toro, on the condition that there be no commercial airport development. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday, as news of the possible land swap spread throughout the business 
community, prospects for a second Orange County airport seemed to gain 
momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 Local developers and real estate experts hailed the possibility as a "win-win" 
situation for the Irvine Co., which could exchange hard-to-develop properties 
for valuable land adjacent to its flagship investment, the Irvine Spectrum. An 
expansive business park, the Spectrum has grown from 250 companies with 2,500 
employees in 1984 to nearly 2,000 companies with more than 32,000 employees 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think an airport, although they won't admit it, is what they want to see 
there," said Jeffrey W. Cole, president of the National Assn. of Office and 
Industrial Properties local chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 Possibilities for an airport become even more attractive when considering how 
difficult residential development would be in light of the toxic contamination 
of the base, said Jeff Meyers, head of a Newport Beach real estate consulting 
firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the toxic cleanup they would need to do, we wouldn't see any housing 
development there in our lifetime," he said. "This site is no cake-walk, but if 
anyone can develop it, it's the Irvine Co." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, the task of planning for the civilian conversion of El Toro 
has been left up to a specially created intergovernmental agency called the El 
Toro Reuse Planning Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 But from the start, the planning process has been fraught with political 
controversy, mostly pitting South County interests against North County's. It 
took months for officials to even settle on the geographic configuration of the 
agency's nine-member governing board. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the trouble, those involved in planning the agency seemed hesitant to 
abandon its mission to present an acceptable conversion plan to the federal 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 But should the land swap be approved, Riley said, it was possible that there 
might be no further use for the agency. At that point, he said, land planning 
authority should be handled by the county Board of Supervisors, since it 
already regulates development of all unincorporated property in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Miller, director of the consulting firm working for the El Toro Reuse 
Planning Authority, was disappointed that the authority -- the agency 
responsible for producing an acceptable development plan for the Marine base -- 
had been "left out of the loop" in the land-swap discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 One federal official called the idea the makings of "a scam," suggesting that 
the Irvine Co. was giving away virtually worthless gnatcatcher habitat that 
would be difficult to develop in exchange for prime land in the heart of Orange 
County. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest Mayor Marcia Rudolph, who opposes a civilian airport at El Toro, 
said she did not think Irvine Co. ownership of El Toro would derail the 
intergovernmental planning process. 
</P>
<P>
 The authority "is going to be integrally involved in the whole thing. The 
Department of Defense has recognized it as the official reuse planning agency," 
said Rudolph. "Remember, it's just ownership that's changing, not use." 
</P>
<P>
 There is also disagreement over how a land exchange would affect the November 
election to determine whether an airport should be built on the property. Some 
believe that a ballot initiative would not govern private property. 
</P>
<P>
 But James E. Erickson, a local land use authority attorney who previously 
worked on the issue, said the ballot measure would have an impact. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative, if approved, would require the county to zone 2,000 acres for 
commercial airport use. That zoning requirement would apply to whoever owns the 
land, Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 That could become important since both federal and local officials believe a 
land swap could not be completed by Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very intriguing scenario," County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez said 
Friday. "This thing (land-swap proposal) has come over the hill rather quickly. 
I don't how fast this train is going down the track." Let's Make a Deal 
</P>
<P>
 The future of El Toro Marine Corps Air Station is one of the most hotly 
debated issues in Orange County. Environmentalists propose that the Irvine Co. 
swap 10,000 acres of undeveloped land bordering Cleveland National Forest to 
the U.S. government for 3,500 acres of the El Toro base. 
</P>
<P>
 Who Benefits 
</P>
<P>
 * Interior Department: Undeveloped land is preserved for public use; expands 
half-million acre Cleveland National Forest 
</P>
<P>
 * Irvine Co.: Would have major influence over El Toro reuse plans after its 
closure 
</P>
<P>
 Top Three Scenarios 
</P>
<P>
 Since the base closure was announced in 1993, several reuse ideas have 
emerged. 
</P>
<P>
 * Airport: John Wayne Airport has two problems. It moves no air cargo and is 
approaching its limit of 8.4 million passengers a year. An El Toro airport 
would provide-much needed relief to businesses, including Federal Express and 
United Parcel Service. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mass transit center: Buses, van-pools, taxis and commuter trains would be 
linked through Orange County Transit Authority. Plan calls for only 100 acres. 
Could be implemented with or without airport. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prison: Two security facilities would house more than 2,000 low- and 
minimum-level security prisoners. Plan calls for only 155 acres. Proposed by 
U.S. Bureau of Prisons.
