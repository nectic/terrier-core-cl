SO MANY PEOPLE . . . HOW WILL WE FEED THEM?; WORLD WAR III: POPULATION AND THE 
BIOSPHERE AT THE END OF THE MILLENNIUM, BY MICHAEL TOBIAS (BEAR & CO.: $29.95; 
656 PP.)

By Marc Lappe, Marc Lappe is the author of seven books on genetics, environment

is the new director of the Center for Ethics and Toxic Substances in Gualala,

<TEXT>
<P>
 Apocalyptic visions of the end of humankind are nothing new. Mathematician and 
amateur sociologist Thomas R. Malthus began the modern tradition with his 
famous "Essay on the Principles of Population," published in 1798. It was 
Malthus's view that human populations would inevitably increase in geometric 
progression and therefore must of necessity ultimately outstrip their food 
supply, a resource which can only increase arithmetically. Many others have 
continued in this vein, not least of whom is Paul Ehrlich who drafted his 
"Population Bomb" as a response to the sense of imminent collapse of the 
world's support base through population pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Tobias follows in this melancholy if not misanthropic tradition by 
writing a lengthy and complex treatise that is a distillation of a lifetime of 
thought and action concerning the human condition. But "World War III" is a 
treatise with a difference. It provides a thread of hope, offering a new vision 
about how humankind may ultimately come to peace with Nature. 
</P>
<P>
 World War III, in Tobias' account, is humankind's struggle with nature -- and 
people are winning. 
</P>
<P>
 In defiance of Malthus's logic, the food supply for humanity -- or at least 
those with the wherewithal to afford it -- continues to keep pace with our rate 
of increase. Much of this vaunted success is the result of the "Green 
Revolution" in which researchers selected varieties of wheat, rice and corn 
with disease resistance, high yields and easy "harvestability." A recent news 
story announced a further genetic improvement in rice strains, leading to a 25% 
increase in production without the need for more fertilizer. With these new 
advances comes the ability to support at least another 450 million people a 
year. Isn't this enough, you may ask? 
</P>
<P>
 Tobias's answer is a vehement "No!" Food crop enhancement is just another 
strategic move in a war of attrition. Where there were once immense plains of 
wild grasses and diverse legume foodstuffs, there are now mono-cultures of corn 
or wheat. The African veld is now pockmarked with fields of corn, much as is 
the Argentine pampas and our own native grasslands in the Midwestern prairies. 
What were once vast plains supporting a balanced ecosystem of ungulates and 
herbivores have been supplanted by vast, monotonous tracts of cereal crops. The 
devastation of the tropical rain forest by the relentless push of population 
pressure is by now a well told story. 
</P>
<P>
 This continuing devastation of the ecosystems of the planet is the greatest 
peril represented by the superabundance of its most profligate large species, 
Homo sapiens. Our incursions into the thin life of the planet are in truth a 
war "against the future." Our pillaging of the biosphere will produce a 
radically reduced biodiversity. 
</P>
<P>
 If our own survival is a victory, it is a sullied one at best. In winning, we 
are killing the planet. Our continuing survival has come about at the expense 
of species diversity and the stability of the web of life on the planet as a 
whole. In this war, the victors (even the next generation) will inherit a much 
impoverished planet, devoid of the species richness which ensures balance and 
perhaps survival of the whole. The costs to retrieve the essential balance and 
integrity of life on the planet when humankind is 40 billion strong will 
eclipse all contemporary expenditures for ecosystem restoration. Tobias sees 
our blindness to these consequences as akin to the denial of the early symptoms 
of a cancer patient whose ultimate illness will be incredibly costly and drain 
his remaining resources. And like the cancer patient, Tobias believes that we 
have only a very short time to muster our resources for the end game. 
</P>
<P>
 Tobias believes that the war to protect biodiversity will be won or lost in 
the next few years. Protecting the web of life will require herculean efforts 
from the wealthy who above all others must greatly curtail their population 
growth. In championing this view, World War III is more akin in spirit and 
focus to E.O. Wilson's "The Diversity of Life" than it is to either Malthus or 
Ehrlich. Like Wilson, Tobias perceives the duty to maintain biodiversity as a 
moral requirement of planet stewardship. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tobias has the breadth of experience as a political scientist and 
participant in population conferences that allows him to put this perspective 
into a world view that eclipses that of Wilson. Unlike other contemporary 
social reformers, Tobias sees the origins and solutions to this dilemma as 
going beyond a simple interplay of political and economic forces of supply and 
demand. 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging the role of disproportionate consumption by the rich in 
depleting resources among the poor, he probes deeper. What he finds is a 
perplexing and counter-intuitive pattern of resource utilization. Why have the 
teeming minions of the Southern tier of developing nations decimated their own 
resources to keep pace with the insatiable demands of the wealthy North? As an 
example, he cites Kerala Province in India, where the perceived need to service 
the economic demands of the wealthy few has led to the devastation of its own 
commons. 
</P>
<P>
 What accounts for the particularly human penchant for aggression against 
nature, a penchant that ultimately leads to species destruction in the name of 
self-preservation? This question is not new. What is new is the way Tobias puts 
this concept into the context of political, social and religious realities that 
make for the patchwork quilt of human cultures and proclivities. 
</P>
<P>
 Population pressure per se is not the core of our current dilemma. It is a 
symptom that greatly exacerbates what Tobias sees as an individual penchant to 
mar the face of planet with individual acts of stupidity -- nuclear accidents, 
oil spills, and mass toxic poisonings. These acts reflect an intrinsic human 
proclivity that is part of the fabric of the human condition itself. And 
without intervention, this proclivity will be greatly intensified. At a 
population of 20 billion or 40 billion (which we may well reach in the next 
century), Tobias predicts that humanity will become a "far more malicious, 
unpredictable, and emotionally bereft creature, stressed to the point of utter, 
relentless insanity." 
</P>
<P>
 The view that the greatest acts of social and ecosystem destruction will be 
the result of beserk, out-of-control "ecoterrorists" or demented souls seeking 
salvation may seem far-fetched. But political terrorism in the name of 
fundamentalism is a present-day reality. And the near fanatic resistance to 
world pressure toward population containment evinced by the Islamic nations at 
the recent UN population conference in Cairo may be the germ of just such a 
movement. 
</P>
<P>
 What then is the countercurrent to the powerful streams of modern political 
movements that demand their fair share? What philosophy or approach can thwart 
the tendency to unlimited growth, dominion and destruction of the world's 
ecology? The answer, in part, comes from Tobias's immersion in Buddhist 
culture. But philosophy is not enough. 
</P>
<P>
 To curb the population growth which threatens to girdle the life of the 
planet, Tobias effectively points to examples from political states like Tamil 
Nadu in India that integrated religious and cultural traditions to enact more 
sane environmental legislation. He also advocates a return to vegetarianism, a 
long recognized solution to chronic overconsumption of protein resources. But 
restraint and self-denial as the routes to curb the devastating and almost 
uniquely American tendency toward consumerism is unlikely to prove a 
prescription for success. To achieve both population control and protection of 
biodiversity will require some form of enlightened self-interest. 
</P>
<P>
 What is the best method to dampen our proclivity for subordination and 
destruction as a means to the ends of species survival? Unfortunately, the 
Theravedic Buddhist ideal of passing through the forest without harming a 
living soul (in Thailand, village youths are hired to sweep the paths of 
elders) is just that, an unattainable ideal. But it serves as a metaphor. That 
is what we need: a metaphor for who we should be, and who we might select as 
our leaders. And were those leaders committed to reshape the course for the 
Earth's survival, they would be well advised to read World War III. For the 
rest of us, this daunting book might serve as a kind of reference book for 
survival, chronicling all that has gone wrong and, more importantly, what might 
be done to set it all aright.

SO MANY PEOPLE . . . HOW WILL WE FEED THEM?; HOW MANY AMERICANS? POPULATION, 
IMMIGRATION AND THE ENVIRONMENT, BY LEON F. BOUVIER AND LINDSEY GRANT (SIERRA 
CLUB BOOKS: $18; 174 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Philip Shabecoff, Philip Shabecoff is the author of A Fierce Green Fire: The 
American Environmental Movement. His next book, A New Name for Peace: 
Environment, Development and Democracy, will be published in 1995. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Those who liked Proposition 187 are going to love some of the measures 
proposed in "How Many Americans" for making the United States "less attractive" 
for illegal immigration: 
</P>
<P>
 Proof of citizenship or legal status would be mandatory for entering real 
estate contracts, for obtaining drivers' licenses or motor vehicle 
registration, qualifying for professional or occupational licenses, obtaining 
business and alcoholic beverage licenses or enrolling in state or federally 
funded colleges. They also ask us to consider "more expeditious procedures for 
deportation and summary exclusion of aliens entering illegally." They would 
erect higher obstacles for those seeking political asylum. Finally, they call 
for a "tamper-proof" identification system in the form of a national ID card. 
</P>
<P>
 With such actions, authors Leon F. Bouvier and Lindsey Grant say, illegal 
immigration can be curbed "without resorting to Draconian measures." One 
wonders what they have in mind as "Draconian." 
</P>
<P>
 Harshness against aliens, however, is not really what this book is about. The 
authors are not xenophobic. They have nothing in particular against Mexicans or 
Chinese or East Europeans. What they are against is people or, more precisely, 
too many people. Their central thesis -- and I believe they are correct -- is 
that excessive numbers of human beings are the single greatest threat to the 
environment, to a healthy economy and to the quality of life of American 
citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 The current U.S. population, around 255 million, is already too high, the 
authors contend. We are producing too much waste and too much pollution, 
consuming unsustainable amounts of energy, eroding our soil, degrading our air 
and water supplies, using up our forests, making housing ever more expensive, 
creating more joblessness and poverty. Our cities are becoming more crowded, 
dirty and violent, our traffic choking, our open space is disappearing. 
</P>
<P>
 If population trends continue on their current path, the book argues, we will 
be in much worse, perhaps desperate straits in the not-very-distant future. 
According to their projections, there would be just under 400 million Americans 
by 2050, when children born in the 1990s will still be in the prime of their 
life. By the end of the 21st Century, unchecked population growth would mean as 
many as a half-billion people living in this country. Except for the rich few, 
Americans will be living mean, hungry lives in an unstable, violent society by 
the middle of the next century. And that might not be the worst. The stress 
placed on life-support systems by the pressure of human numbers could cause 
"the collapse or extinction of our own species." 
</P>
<P>
 The answer to this threat, Bouvier and Grant argue with cool, cogent urgency, 
is not just to slow population growth but to roll it back to an optimal level. 
Their number is 150 million, the size of the U.S. population at the time of 
World War II. Continued reductions in already declining fertility rates would 
not be sufficient to achieve this goal. Legal immigration must therefore be 
limited to 200,000 a year, down from the current level around 700,000, and 
illegal immigration must be stopped entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 "How Many Americans?" is a thoughtful, even admirable book about what is 
arguably the most important dilemma facing humanity. Population projections are 
just that -- projections. But Bouvier, a professor at Tulane University and 
Senior Fellow at the Center for Immigration Studies, has a reputation as a 
careful demographer. While the population threat has been the subject of many 
previous books, it is an issue that cannot be called often enough to public 
attention, and this one is well-researched, readable and, for the most part, 
well argued. 
</P>
<P>
 It does, however, have one significant flaw. Unfortunately, that flaw is a 
central premise of the book. 
</P>
<P>
 The population problem -- the harm that the rapid growth of human numbers is 
inflicting on the natural world, on human society and on individual members of 
the human species -- is not an American problem. It is a global problem. The 
question that must be answered is not how many Americans, but how many people 
can live on the planet with a modicum of comfort and dignity?  
</P>
<P>
 Studies such as Worldwatch's State of the World series and Beyond the Limits 
suggest that the global population may already be approaching the carrying 
capacity of the planet in a number of ways, particularly the capacity of the 
atmosphere and oceans to absorb our wastes. One-fifth of the world's people 
already suffer from utter poverty and hunger. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is part of a global environment, a global economy. It is 
folly to think that if we erect a fence around the country to keep people out, 
it will also keep out the greenhouse effect, toxic substances, resource 
scarcity, economic competition and joblessness. 
</P>
<P>
 The authors argue, for example, that with a lower population, the American 
farmers would need to put fewer acres under cultivation, use less chemical 
pesticides and fertilizers and create less erosion. But of course, U.S. 
agriculture serves a global market and, as world population grows, it will have 
to put increased pressure on the land to meet the rising needs of the hungry 
around the world. U.S. jobs are not protected by restricting the number of 
immigrants; millions of manufacturing jobs have been exported by American 
corporations to low-wage workers in poor countries in recent decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowering the fertility rate in the United States would be a contribution to 
slowing the rocketing ascent of global population. Further restrictions on 
immigration, however, would not reduce such growth by a single soul. In fact, 
the contrary argument could be made. As the authors themselves point out, for 
example, fertility among Hispanic immigrants drops sharply as they learn 
English and become acculturated. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharply limiting immigration might keep some environmental and economic 
problems at bay for a time. It might serve some immediate political or social 
interests. But inevitably the misery and destruction created by the rising tide 
of people around the rest of the world would overwhelm us as well. There is no 
place to hide. 
</P>
<P>
 The best policy answer, therefore, would not be to restrict immigrants but to 
do more to help the poorer nations attain the economic and educational levels 
and improved status for women that would lower domestic birth rates and 
encourage their populations to stay at home. That, after all, is what the 
nations of the world agreed on two years ago at the Earth Summit in Rio and at 
this year's population conference in Cairo. The conventional and probably 
accurate wisdom is that spurs to development in the poorer countries, including 
external debt relief, improved terms of trade with the industrialized nations, 
greater access to markets and advanced technology, along with increased 
assistance for family planning and education for women, are the best tools for 
lowering fertility. (Given the recent pronouncements by Jesse Helms, the next 
chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, about slashing foreign aid, 
that probably is not a very realistic option for the immediate future.) 
</P>
<P>
 National policy kept immigration at low levels during the 1930s. Many European 
Jews were denied asylum and were exterminated in the German concentration 
camps. But, it might be useful to recall, such restrictive immigration policies 
did not keep America out of the World War.

THE PURE POETRY OF DESIRE; DAVID ST. JOHN DOESN'T BELIEVE WE CAN LIVE IN A 
WORLD OF PURE BEAUTY AND DESIRE, BUT HE DOESN'T WANT TO LIVE OR MAKE POEMS 
WITHOUT THEM EITHER; STUDY FOR THE WORLD'S BODY: NEW AND SELECTED POEMS, BY 
DAVID ST. JOHN (HARPERCOLLINS: $11; 142 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>

By Robert Hass, Robert Hass is the author, most recently, of The Essential 
Haiku (Ecco Press).

<TEXT>
<P>
 David St. John, who teaches at the University of Southern California and whose 
new book was nominated for the National Book Award, is a gorgeous writer. This 
has been true of his work from the beginning, but I think even those who have 
followed him closely will be taken by surprise when they read "Study for the 
World's Body." It is a selection of poems, and gathers work from St. John's 
four previous collections, beginning with the stylish and much-praised "Hush" 
of 1976, adds to it the best of "The Shore" (1980), "No Heaven" (1985), 
"Terraces of Rain" (1991) and concludes with a final section of newer poems. 
This last section is called "Merlin," and it is what is likely to surprise St. 
John's readers, new and old. 
</P>
<P>
 Because it is not just gorgeous, it is go-for-broke gorgeous. It is made out 
of sentences, sweeping through and across his meticulous verse stanzas, that 
could have been written, for their velvet and intricate suavity, by Henry 
James. But that doesn't quite describe them, since they are also full, almost 
past ripeness, of a floating, sometimes painful, sometimes wistful, intense, 
dark and silvery eroticism that feels like it comes out of some cross between 
late 19th-Century symbolist lushness -- vague and specific at once -- and the 
kind of '60s and '70s European film that talked about eroticism with a 
wistfulness so intense that it seemed experience and the melancholy 
recollection of experience were the same thing. Mallarme and Eric Rohmer, 
perhaps. Or Rilke and Michaelangelo Antonioni. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is one such sentence from "A Fan Sketched With Silver Egrets," a poem 
which bears the subtitle, "Hommage a Mallarme": 
</P>
<P>
 As this flights of egrets  
</P>
<P>
 Across the silk mask, this fan  
</P>
<P>
 Held so softly to your lips,  
</P>
<P>
 Seems to break apart as slowly  
</P>
<P>
 As blown ash, feathers rippling in the heavy  
</P>
<P>
 Weather of evening, you need not speak . . . even here,  
</P>
<P>
 Concealed by this soft wing (like a mirror  
</P>
<P>
 Trembling, like Narcissus' own breath),  
</P>
<P>
 As I lean closer to you, ready to step  
</P>
<P>
 Into a future so pure, we will both lose  
</P>
<P>
 Our separate ways. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 This is of course, mimicry, homage. And as you can give yourself over to it 
for the pleasure of it, a question is likely to occur to you: What is a 
well-known American poet, a Southern California poet in the 1990s, doing 
replicating, even exaggerating -- but lovingly, without parody, as if it were a 
hypnotic tracing of the older hand -- the style of the 1880s? 
</P>
<P>
 There's not much mistaking this intent. The first of the new poems St. John 
collects begins with an epigraph from Paul Valery's essay on Mallarme, and 
reads like -- perhaps it is -- a translation, not quite a parody, of one of 
Mallarme's sonnets. Listen to the beginning of it: 
</P>
<P>
 I know the moon is troubling.  
</P>
<P>
 Its pale eloquence is always such a meddling,  
</P>
<P>
 Intrusive lie. I know the pearl sheel of the sheets  
</P>
<P>
 Remains the screen I'll draw back against the night.  
</P>
<P>
 This moonstruck tone is not only the very atmosphere of that late 19th-Century 
style known as "the decadence," the "troubling/meddling" rhyme is the very 
sound of Mallarme. Listen to this, a bit further on in the poem: 
</P>
<P>
 I know the orchid smell of your skin  
</P>
<P>
 The way I know the blackened path to the marina,  
</P>
<P>
 When gathering clouds obscure the summer moon,  
</P>
<P>
 Just as I know the chambered heart where I begin.  
</P>
<P>
 I know too the lacquered jewel box, its obsidian patina. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Readers who don't know St. John and start this book at the beginning will come 
to these poems last, of course. And I think the experience will be surprising 
because of these last poems. It's as if you were watching a movie of the 
history of modern poetry being run backward. The book begins with the 
up-to-date, uncannily deft voice of "Hush" with its mid-70s ironies. Almost 20 
years ago, the early post-modern phase, when young poets were fascinated with 
John Ashbery's immaculately impure way of going nowhere in a poem on the 
plausible theory that there was nowhere to go. In "Hush," St. John found his 
own version of the non-sequitur narrative. 
</P>
<P>
 His second, "The Shore," is all eros and elegy. The poems have let go the 
shifty, playful postmodern manner and turned to meditative first-person lyrics, 
something like those of Kenneth Rexroth's of the 1940s and '50s. They are full 
of coastal imagery, radiant with romantic desolation and with loss. 
</P>
<P>
 There is one line that sums up this intense melancholy: "Even the sea sings 
one octave in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 What most marks "No Heaven" and "Terraces of Rain" is the experience of 
Europe, St. John's love affair with the landscapes of Italy and with Italian 
modernism. "No Heaven" modulates between the styles of the first two books, and 
if "The Shore" is obsessed by a woman, "No Heaven" is obsessed by women. 
</P>
<P>
 "Terraces of Rain" includes one of his best, and best-known, poems, a 
complicated, moving, many-voiced elegy for the Italian poet and film-maker Pier 
Paolo Pasolini, murdered, apparently, in a sexual encounter in the poor 
district of Rome where he grew up and to which he returned late at night to 
recover some mystery in himself from the boy prostitutes who haunted its 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems to be these poems, with their ambivalence about fantasy and 
fascination with desire, that lead St. John back to the idiom of the 
symbolists, straight back to the otherworldly music of poets sick of this one, 
permanently fascinated by loss as the romantic condition and by the space 
between desire and all the objects it finds to spend itself on in the world. 
Here is another sentence from the final section of the book, from a poem called 
"Lucifer in Starlight": 
</P>
<P>
 And Nico  
</P>
<P>
 Pulled herself close to me, her mouth almost  
</P>
<P>
 Touching my mouth, as she sighed, "Look . . . ,"  
</P>
<P>
 And deep within the pupil of her left eye,  
</P>
<P>
 Almost like the mirage of a ship's distant, hanging  
</P>
<P>
 Lantern rocking with the waves,  
</P>
<P>
 I could see, at the most remote end of the receding,  
</P>
<P>
 Circular hallway of her eye, there, at its doorway,  
</P>
<P>
 At the small aperture of the black telescope of the pupil,  
</P>
<P>
 A tiny, dangling crucifix --  
</P>
<P>
 Silver, lit by the ragged shards of starlight, reflecting  
</P>
<P>
 In her as quietly as pain, as simply as pain. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 This is something more complicated than mimicry. You can't quite tell who the 
speaker is -- a melancholy man who has an apartment in Rome; he drives a red 
Lancia -- why not? -- so it's the 20th Century -- but it is the same tone of 
stylized desire, stylized longing, beautifully rendered. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles is also that territory in "Los Angeles, 1954," a poem whose 
language has the effect of making the idiom of Raymond Chandler, or Walter 
Mosely passed through Raymond Chandler, sound like another smokier, bluesier 
version of the poetry of longing, which, of course, it was. The speaker recalls 
a woman from "the old days,/When she used to hang out at a place/Called Club 
Zombie,/A black cabaret that the police liked/To raid now and then," and the 
black singer who wanted her, and like all the characters in this poems, had her 
and didn't have her. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when the setting -- and the sexual repertoire -- is distinctly 
contemporary and American and the tone is ironic, the long sentences are tinged 
with a European, bittersweet, retrospective lushness. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's going on? What's going on, I think, is that partly from pure, 
addictive pleasure, partly with analytic cunning, St. John found himself drawn 
back through various modernist and postmodern idioms to their place of origin 
in the pure poetry of romantic desire and its most theatrical idiom. That's why 
he's quoting Valery on Mallarme: "The definition of beauty is easy; it is what 
leads us to desperation." And it is true. The writing all through these last 
poems in the book is gorgeous and more gorgeous, and the place it seems to 
leave writer and reader is pretty desperate. Even the move to that style, as if 
he were tracing with his hand the poems of Mallarme to see if, written again, 
they'd turn out differently, seems desperate. As if he were testing to see if 
his instinct was true: that a century after the decadents the poetry of desire 
is right back where it started from, trapped in an idiom that wants to stay as 
long as it can in fantasy, memory, erotic longing, erotic regret. 
</P>
<P>
 It occurs to me to say that this is a theme not uncommon among Los Angeles 
poets. If all of contemporary poetry has had to do with the space that desire 
makes and how we fill it, it seems that a number of Los Angeles writers and 
poets -- Wanda Coleman, Amy Gerstler, James McMichael, Dennis Cooper, Killarney 
Clarey, Arthur Vogelsang, Carol Muske, to name some of the very good and very 
different writers who come to mind -- have taken up the subject and given it an 
edge and nervous or lush sexual content that might have to do with proximity to 
a major center of the desire-representing industry. When William Butler Yeats 
rejected the poetry of his symbolist youth, he pronounced a judgment on it: "We 
have fed our hearts on fantasy, and our hearts grew brutal on the fare." St. 
John's recent poems seem to move us back into the space before that judgment, 
to look again at its sources, its natural environment of languorous deferral in 
great, sensuous, world-devouring sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last poem in the book, St. John makes what seems a diagnostic gesture. 
Actually, the last poem is two poems set side by side, making a pair of columns 
down the page. The first of them, "The Body of Desire," is over-the-top in a 
book already full of high romantic rhetoric. It is a kind of exquisite erotic 
reverie and meditation, complete with a mysterious woman named Seven who lives 
in a chateau and wears her boots to bed, written in a style as dense and lushly 
beautiful as anything in the book. Next to it, across from it, is a second 
poem, "Of Time & the Body," which is an elegy to a friend of the poet, written 
in a much airier, simpler contemporary idiom, perhaps out of William Carlos 
Williams, that thinks bleakly, clearly, and movingly about the death of a man, 
a dance critic in love with Balanchine, and about time and the body, and the 
limits both impose, and about the way dance is a pure expression of these 
things: body, movement, limit, time, and death. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is one passage from the first poem: 
</P>
<P>
 Seven  
</P>
<P>
 Turns to me, lips  
</P>
<P>
 Lit in the reddish dawn light --  
</P>
<P>
 Wild mouth of a fallen poppy --  
</P>
<P>
 Ash-scarlet, brash. Naked  
</P>
<P>
 Beneath the sky's low dome  
</P>
<P>
 Of shadow. Her fingers solemnly  
</P>
<P>
 Tunnelling my hair, my own mouth  
</P>
<P>
 Working the hymn of her ribs.  
</P>
<P>
 A few lines later: 
</P>
<P>
 There, as  
</P>
<P>
 I knelt before her, those pearls  
</P>
<P>
 Gathering like white mustard seeds  
</P>
<P>
 At each red ridge. Some nights she'd rub  
</P>
<P>
 My body raw with limes, with myrrh.  
</P>
<P>
 The first few lines seem right at the edge of pornographic cliche, and last 
line and a half -- very memorable in its way: "Some nights she'd rub my body 
raw with limes" -- are at once deeply silly and somehow committed to the 
fantasy. All through the poem -- it is several pages long -- gorgeous writing, 
rich musicality, haunting images of desire so fantastic that they rise toward 
bathos, go over the edge, and then return again to sheer romantic intensity. 
You really have to read the poem to get the effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Next to it, across from it, a straightforward, mostly plain-spoken meditative 
elegy that occasionally looks ironically at the language on the other side of 
the page: 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of a death  
</P>
<P>
 So much our own  
</P>
<P>
 It wears a lover's face,  
</P>
<P>
 The landscape of the lover's  
</P>
<P>
 Worldly body; where even  
</P>
<P>
 The sunlight, as they say,  
</P>
<P>
 Dances along the water  
</P>
<P>
 Of the fountain . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I think the point of putting these two poems together is to end the book at a 
cul-de-sac, at a sense of the absolute split between, or at least the 
permanently parallel tracks of, the dream life of desire and the life of mind 
and body in the world. A split, flat out, unresolved. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a gesture at once supremely confident and desperate by a writer who can't 
quite give up pure beauty, the pure fix of desire, and doesn't believe you can 
live there, and who also doesn't want to live in a world, or make poems about a 
world, without it. A very nervy summing-up. And a beautiful, strange, dubious, 
elegant, enormously skillful, self-mocking book. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be extremely interesting to see where David St. John goes from here.

VANISHED LIVES; WRITER TRACES THE LIVES OF HIS WHITE, ANGLO-SAXON, PROTESTANT 
ANCESTORS THROUGH 2 CENTURIES; FAMILY, BY IAN FRAZIER (FARRAR, STRAUS & GIROUX: 
$23; 386 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Hugh Nissenson, Hugh Nissenson's latest novel, The Tree of Life won the 
Ohioana Book Award of 1986 in the category of fiction. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ian Frazier immediately conveys the theme of his powerful new book, "Family," 
in a prefatory quote from Thomas Wolfe's novel, "Look Homeward, Angel": 
</P>
<P>
 We can believe in the nothingness of life,  
</P>
<P>
 we can believe in the nothingness of death  
</P>
<P>
 and of life after death -- but who can  
</P>
<P>
 believe in the nothingness of Ben?  
</P>
<P>
 Frazier's "Family" affirms the somethingness of the vanished lives of white, 
Anglo-Saxon, Protestant ancestors throughout 200 years of American history. He 
substantiates their existence by skillfully narrating their stories in a 
vigorous, vernacular style, from which evocative similes often effortlessly 
arise: "When we studied glaciers in an Ohio history class in grade school, I 
imagined our glacier receding smoothly, like a sheet pulled off a new car." 
And, "My father used to lie awake at night by the hour. I knew that if I 
knocked on (my parents') bedroom door at three in the morning his voice would 
answer immediately, unblurred by sleep, level as water." 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, his similes don't work: "Bees fumbled in the wildflowers like 
thumbs." Or " . . . sometimes a flock of gulls billows above the community like 
a bedsheet." 
</P>
<P>
 By and large, Frazier's voice -- his plain American speech -- unifies the 
diverse elements of his sprawling chronicle. Taken together, his compilation of 
personal experiences, memories, history, interviews, lists, letters and diaries 
make up an epic narrative of the development and attenuation of White 
Anglo-Saxon Protestant, rural, educated, middle-class American civilization. 
Frazier is the last of his line to be born and raised in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 He was awakened to his creative task by his parents' deaths within a few years 
of each other: "I wanted my parents' lives to have meant something. I hunted 
all over for meanings of any kind . . . the stuff they saved implied that there 
must have been a reason for saving it. The smell of an old hymnal, the weave of 
a black mesh hat veil, the tone of a thank-you note, each struck me with the 
silent force of a clue. . . . I didn't care if (their) meanings were far-flung 
or vague or even trivial. I wanted to pursue them. I hoped maybe I could find a 
meaning that would defeat death." 
</P>
<P>
 Encompassed, like the Psalmist, by the sorrow of death, Frazier sought solace 
by the exercise of his abundant gifts as a writer. His forebears would have 
turned to Jesus Christ. "Compared to them," he says. "I suppose I am an 
infidel." They were almost all devout Protestants -- Frazier calls them 
"frontier Calvinists" -- who were obsessed by the state of their souls. "They 
prayed out loud, cited Scripture in conversation." The King James Bible was an 
essential component of their culture: "A person who moved fast they might say 
was 'going like Jehu,' from Jehu, a King of Israel, the fastest driver in the 
Bible (11 Kings, 9:20), whose chariot a watchman could identify in the far 
distance from the tower of Jerusalem: 'The driving is like the driving of Jehu 
. . . for he driveth furiously.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Some were church members of the Disciples of Christ, a Protestant sect founded 
in the 1820s, which was opposed to "church hierarchies, forms of worship not 
mentioned in the New Testament, and all statements of creed. . . ." Their ideas 
made sense to lots of people; hundreds of thousands joined them, creating one 
of the largest indigenous religious movements in American history. They 
believed America was the Promised Land given them by God; they wanted to build 
a New Jerusalem here. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier gives us glimpses of their rich inner lives with details taken from 
family diaries and letters -- lovely examples of American prose. This is from a 
letter written in an Ohio farmhouse in 1868: " . . . evening and children all 
in bed, and for two or three hours I can think and know what I am about." 
</P>
<P>
 But Frazier never romanticizes his ancestors. He says right out that some were 
in the slave trade, and others owned slaves. None liked Catholics and Jews. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier's people, who settled in the Carolinas and New England before the 
Revolution, moved west early on; he paints a vivid word-picture of frontier 
Ohio, with its immense, dark forests filled with gigantic trees, its one-room 
cabins and smoky taverns, in which the coffee was "a libel on diluted soot." 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio, for Frazier, is an American state of mind. Family is permeated with its 
landscape: the light, clouds, trees, birds and animals. Norwalk, Ohio, which 
was founded by Frazier's great-great-great-great-grandfather, is the living 
heart of his book. He lovingly re-create 19th- and 20th-Century small town life 
there -- secure and comfortable, rooted in extended familial relationships. 
Lucy Preston Wickham fed 75 relatives at her Christmas dinners. " . . . she 
cared for her grandfather Taylor until he died at age ninety-six . . . she 
proofread the (family owned newspaper) and sometimes wrote editorials . . . she 
learned sign language to talk to a (deaf and mute) woman who sewed for her." 
</P>
<P>
 The family's Edenic existence was interrupted by the Civil War, in which 
almost all its male members fought. Frazier focuses on their historic 
confrontation with violent death: "Will Wickham 'drifted' across a half mile of 
open field and was about to enter some woods when he stopped to watch a group 
of artillerymen trying to free a brass howitzer from a ditch. Suddenly he heard 
a sound like a smart slap on the face and turned to see a soldier standing 
erect as if at attention with a hole through his forehead the size of a 
half-dollar. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier's consciousness of death shapes "Family." His sensitivity is 
accompanied by a writer's most important gift: He makes readers feel for his 
characters. We're sad when his younger brother Fritz dies at 15 of leukemia. 
And when his father, David, dies from Alzheimer's and Peggy, his mother, from 
liver cancer, we take it hard because we've gotten to know and like them. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, David Frazier's suffering outlived him; among the diaries and 
letters and notes to himself that he left behind is "a piece of yellow 
note-paper" with the following written on it in his "shaky, latter-day 
printing:" 
</P>
<P>
 DEPRESSION  
</P>
<P>
 ANXIETIE  
</P>
<P>
 ANXIITY  
</P>
<P>
 ANXIETY DEPRESSION  
</P>
<P>
 ANXITY  
</P>
<P>
 Frazier's "Family" is hard to put down. He structures his narrative in both a 
lineal and thematic way. He occasionally jumps around in time, while developing 
individual stories, but they all compel the reader's attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier eulogizes his beloved dead, all his progenitors. He mourns the passing 
of their uniquely American way of life and religious sensibility, which helped 
form our national consciousness. He laments the death of God within himself. 
The presence or absence of God in our lives is a major theme of our classical 
writers, from Jonathan Edwards to Ernest Hemingway. Ian Frazier's "Family" is a 
deeply moving book in a great American literary tradition.

RICHARD EDER: 'WHAT THEY LEAST KILL IS WRITERS'; THE SILENCING OF CUBA'S 
ARTISTIC AND LITERARY COMMUNITY UNDER CASTRO; MEA CUBA, BY GUILLERMO CABRERA 
INFANTE . TRANSLATED FROM SPANISH BY KENNETH HALL WITH THE AUTHOR (FARRAR, 
STRAUS, GIROUX: $23; 503 PP.)

By RICHARD EDER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first two years after Fidel Castro's triumphant entry into Havana, 
Cuba's artistic and literary life bubbled vigorously. It had not really been 
stagnant under Fulgencio Batista, who took no interest in what artists did 
unless they engaged in political resistance; nevertheless, the dictator's 
overthrow released an exuberant energy. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an energy of the left, of course, since that was where most writers, 
painters, musicians and film-makers placed themselves anyway. It was also 
libertarian, ungovernable and unrestrained. Its voice was found most 
particularly in "Lunes de Revolucion," the weekly literary supplement of the 
newspaper Revolucion, whose director, Carlos Franqui, embodied the violent 
idealism of the revolution's first years. 
</P>
<P>
 In its brief life, "Lunes" was a meteor, and by far the most vital literary 
publication in Latin America. Its editor, a young novelist, critic and hopeless 
Hollywood buff, thought of himself as an "anarcho-Surrealist." That amounts to 
cultural gourmandizing; the equivalent to sitting through a triple feature with 
chocolate peanuts as well as popcorn and butter. 
</P>
<P>
 It took less than two years for the chill of repression to be felt in other 
aspects of the Cuban revolution; for Castro's totalitarian elan to devour his 
revolutionary elan -- allying itself at first with the Communists and then 
devouring many of them as well. Guillermo Cabrera Infante writes in "Mea Cuba" 
of the months in early 1961 when the freeze reached the artists and closed down 
his "Lunes." 
</P>
<P>
 His brother and a collaborator had made a short feature, "PM," that toured the 
smoky bars and dives of Havana in the best bittersweet film-noir manner. The 
authorities banned it as decadent. "Lunes," with the support of dozens of 
artists and writers, was about to publish an indignant protest when the 
government organized a three-day meeting to forestall it. President Osvaldo 
Dorticos urged the intellectuals to speak their minds without fear; Castro made 
a speech assuring them that "within the Revolution all things are possible." 
</P>
<P>
 Virgilio Pinero, a timid, shrunken, flamboyantly gay writer, made his way 
hesitantly to the microphone. "I only want to say that I'm very frightened. I 
don't know why I'm so frightened but that is all I have to say." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, there was not much more to say. "Lunes" was shut down, 
ostensibly for a shortage of newsprint; Revolucion lasted only a little longer. 
Franqui went to live in Paris, Cabrera Infante was given a diplomatic job in 
Brussels, and a number of "Lunes" writers found brief employment in the 
government cultural agency. 
</P>
<P>
 It was gradual but relentless removal from the intellectual and artistic life 
of the country. Except for homosexuals -- among whom were a number of the most 
talented Cuban artists -- there were few harsh individual measures (the jailing 
of the poet Heberto Padilla was a notable exception). The punishment was exile 
or silence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mea Cuba" gives the silence a clamorous voice: eloquent and powerful at 
times, and at others wordy, repetitive, strident and eventually hoarse. It is 
steadily obsessed with the wreckage of Cuba's material, moral and cultural 
values by one man's will-to-power; whose various manifestations the author 
refers to with such epithets as "Castro Convertible" and "Castroenterology." 
</P>
<P>
 Cabrera Infante, who has lived in London since breaking with Castro and 
publishing his satirical novel "Three Trapped Tigers" (a favorable review was 
one of the things that landed Padilla in jail), is addicted to puns and word 
games. It energizes him, perhaps, but it depletes the reader. 
</P>
<P>
 There are more serious weaknesses in "Mea Cuba." It is a collection of some 60 
articles written over a quarter-century and printed in a number of different 
periodicals. Many of them borrow or repeat from each other; no effort has been 
made to edit the repetitions out. Furthermore the translation, in which the 
author took a hand, is clumsy; at times ludicrously so. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a pity because it makes Cabrera Infante's strengths less accessible. 
Through the personal recollections, portraits, polemics and accounts of the 
recent and more remote past, he has put together something of a history of the 
Cuban imagination and character. 
</P>
<P>
 There is an exploration of Cuban suicide, for example. Castro's hopeless 
attack on the Moncada fortress early in his revolutionary career was virtually 
a kamikaze action. The author mentions the suicide of an opposition politician 
as climax to a radio speech (he didn't realize that the station had already 
switched to a commercial), and of a mayor unable to fulfill a campaign promise. 
He writes of the suicides of Haydee Santamaria, one of Castro's closest 
associates, and of Dorticos, whom Castro had deposed. Could 35 years of putting 
up with Revolutionary decline amount to a national suicidal instinct? 
Far-fetched, perhaps, but suggestive. 
</P>
<P>
 His polemics range from petty -- his anger at the pro-Castro Gabriel Garcia 
Marquez is such that he calls him an inferior writer -- to splendid. Even 
better are some of his portraits. 
</P>
<P>
 He gives evocative accounts of Lezama Lima, the defiantly decadent writer whom 
the government all but starved, of Pinero and his timid valor, of Nicolas 
Guillen, proud of his official favor until one day Castro, perhaps in passing, 
called him lazy. "He's worse than Stalin," the shocked Guillen complained to 
the author, who was still in Cuba at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 The most memorable portrait is of Gustavo Arcos, the man who would not bend. 
He fought with Castro during the Moncada assault, joined him in Mexico to 
prepare the Sierra Maestra campaign; today, after many years in prison he is 
one of the country's much-persecuted civil rights leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an extraordinary story of a man who lost favor with Castro because of 
his insistence on speaking his mind. Named ambassador to Belgium, to get him 
out of the country, he was being considered for the Rome embassy when he was 
arrested. Released, he tried to leave Cuba to see his desperately ill son in 
Miami. He was sentenced to 14 years more; at the same time, Castro brought his 
family back, lodged them in a luxury hotel and got the finest available medical 
care for the son. At one point he offered Arcos his freedom if would promise 
not to try to leave. Arcos refused and served many years longer. 
</P>
<P>
 In exile, Cabrera Infante worked hard but in vain to enlist literary and 
intellectual figures in a fight for Arcos. The trouble was that he wasn't a 
writer, an artist or an intellectual. And Cabrera Infante concludes brilliantly 
with an account of refusing an invitation to a London human rights conference 
entitled, with would-be mordancy: "They Kill Writers, Don't They?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them that the title was not true. I told them that in totalitarian 
countries like Cuba, the last thing they kill is writers. They kill workers, 
peasants, leaders of the clandestine movement, Jehovah's witnesses, whites and 
blacks. Everyone. But what they least kill is writers. Those shut up or get 
scared or their silence is bought with a house and a car and several trips to 
Europe. Or they leave the country as exiles. They don't kill writers. They 
kill, precisely, men without imagination like Gustavo Arcos. They kill their 
heroes."

COVER STORY: HOW TO STAY IN SHAPE AND WATCH TV; RATING THE FITNESS SHOW 
SMORGASBORD

<TEXT>
<P>
 My annual fall from diet and exercise grace started several weeks ago when my 
friend married a celebrated French chef. The wedding was a three-day-long food 
fest, and I sampled every last piece of fromage . The weekend is a distant 
memory now, but I can't seem to forget the creme brulee that has settled 
not-so-nicely into my thighs. 
</P>
<P>
 With my defenses already down, Halloween proved to be a scary experience. I'm 
not a candy nut, but I am a pumpkin freak, so I feasted on pumpkin muffins, 
pumpkin scones, pumpkin ravioli. All that pump can make you plump. Once I get 
started on a holiday roll, I go unconscious when it comes to my usual 
health-consciousness. The trend continues through Thanksgiving, Hanukkah, 
Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Dec. 31 arrives, I'm ready to scream "Stop the insanity" and beg 
Rosie to be my personal chef. My uniform is stretchable leggings, and it's not 
because I'm working out. Then it's resolution time. Phew . 
</P>
<P>
 This year, I decided to short-circuit my pattern and get a jump on my new 
routine. Why have heartache on New Year's Eve when I can be cardiovascular fit? 
But I wasn't ready to face my L.A. gym where everyone looks like the aerobics 
instructor. And the early mornings (when I like to workout) are too dark and 
chilly to be outside. Where to turn when you've ruled out thigh cream and 
liposuction? Turn on -- and to -- the TV. 
</P>
<P>
 There are more than a dozen workout shows on the tube, and they've come a long 
way since Jack LaLanne. So for a week I tried them all. I found that the 
hardest part of fitness TV was staying on my feet. Couch potatodom is an easy 
option when your instructor can't see you. 
</P>
<P>
 The shows are rated on the heart (*) scale, with **** being excellent. THE 
HIGHLIGHTS: 
</P>
<P>
 BODIES IN MOTION 
</P>
<P>
 Monday-Friday, 6 a.m. ESPN 
</P>
<P>
 *** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
 The Workout: "Welcome to Hawaii," says Gilad Janklowicz, host of this 
mid-to-high impact aerobics class. The setting -- white sands and blue sea -- 
is enough to scare me off the couch (the beach ... swimwear!). The former 
Israeli decathlete and head of the fitness programs for the Israeli army starts 
out with a warm-up and progresses quickly to an intense routine followed by a 
cool-down. He of the tight buns and booming voice yells out instructions 
throughout. "Exhale!" Hey, I can do that. Gilad's squats were not as easy. 
</P>
<P>
 In Shape (Pros): Gilad's no-nonsense, high-energy style may work. He's more 
drill sergeant than cheerleader, but his down-to-business attitude is 
motivating. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of Shape (Cons): Me. This is not aerobics for the fainthearted -- I was 
drenched. I recommend this solid workout to those who are already somewhat in 
shape. 
</P>
<P>
 GETTING FIT WITH DENISE AUSTIN 
</P>
<P>
 Monday-Friday, 6:30 a.m. ESPN  
</P>
<P>
 *** 
</P>
<P>
 The Workout: "Are you ready to burn fat? Get up on your feet!" chimes Denise 
Austin, the ultimate cheerleader-style host. This exercise maven, sister-in-law 
of Tracy Austin, takes a friendlier approach than Gilad. She chatters 
throughout the low-impact aerobics workout set in a different exotic locale 
each week. When I watched, it was just Denise on the balcony overlooking 
Acapulco and me in the living room. She emphasizes personal attention: "Just 
turn on the TV and say, 'Denise is here, my personal trainer.' " Yippee. Her 
favorite catch phrase is "Oh, it feels so good" (speak for yourself, honey). 
</P>
<P>
 In Shape: This fitness expert knows her stuff. She focuses on problem areas 
that women in particular deal with, such as the upper arms and thighs ("No more 
jigglies"). She also gives constant reminders about form. Denise deals with 
self-esteem issues: "You're worth it, you deserve a great body," she says 
during some grueling leg lifts. Her tips, such as how she lost 30 pounds after 
pregnancy, are informative. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of Shape: Her outfits. Denise, can you lose the hot-pink leotard, pink 
hairbow and pink socks ensemble? And some of those pep-talks drove me to grab 
the remote and ... bye-bye. 
</P>
<P>
 STEP REEBOK 
</P>
<P>
 Monday-Friday, 7 a.m. ESPN  
</P>
<P>
 *** 
</P>
<P>
 The Workout: After Gilad and Denise inspired me to make travel plans, the 
high-tech studio in Universal Studios near Orlando, Fla., where Gin Miller and 
the Step Reebok gang do their stepping, looks austere. But Gin, an inventor of 
the step movement, has a friendly style that lends warmth. Not to mention that 
after her thorough workout, I was downright overheated. 
</P>
<P>
 In Shape: This class, which has cool music, cool routines and cool class 
members (one even keeps his sunglasses on), provides the cutting edge in step 
aerobics. One of the steppers does the workout without a step for the viewers 
who don't have one. Gin also includes resistance training with weights. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of Shape: Some of the sequences are hard to follow. I had to stop when I 
just couldn't get in step. 
</P>
<P>
 BODYSHAPING 
</P>
<P>
 Monday-Friday, 7:30 a.m. ESPN  
</P>
<P>
 ** 
</P>
<P>
 The Workout: Want to get pumped up? This show is primarily about 
weightlifting. So unless you have a state-of-the-art home gym (I don't), TV 
viewers are best served by watching the cast members' routines and trying them 
out later at the gym. Or not. 
</P>
<P>
 In Shape: Just seeing those sculpted bodies is an inspiration to begin 
strength training. The cast is a title-holding crew ranging from former Mr. Los 
Angeles Rick Valente to Ms. Olympia Carla Dunlap to Miss Fitness Laurie 
Donnelly. (In comparison, I was Ms. Flabby). The outdoor Tucson, Ariz., setting 
is a plus. And because the cast members are so scantily clad, it's easy to see 
their form. This show has its own resident chiropractor, the super-buff Dr. 
Peter Gratale. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of Shape: I watched most of it from the kitchen while eating. And are 
those skimpy bikinis really necessary? I found the gratuitous camera angles 
even less necessary.

 The Workout: The guys wear Doc Martens and baggies, and the women wear neon 
Lycra shorts and bra tops. Made me feel a little schlumpy in my T-shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 In Shape: This fun hip-hop, cardio-funk workout from Utah rivals the best 
aerobics classes at L.A. health clubs. The "pros" also give tips on stretching 
and weightlifting. After a jolting dose of these fitness nuts at 4:30 a.m., who 
needs coffee? 
</P>
<P>
 Out of Shape: Slow down! I tripped over my own feet in an attempt to get 
funky. It's X-ercise for Generation X, and may be intimidating to others. 
Beginners beware.

<P>
 The Workout: "Squeeze that buttissimo," Jake Steinfeld shouts as he plays 
personal trainer to one member of "Jake's Gang" (a regular person), a "Jake 
Pro" (workout monster) and me. The fitness guru leads us through what he calls 
a "fun workout." (Don't joke, Jake. You're Steinfeld, not Seinfeld.) Abdominal 
crunches, bent-leg pushups, bicep curls -- it's serious stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 In Shape: He's Jake. He's a personality (and actor). Another highlight: 
Instead of doing the exercises himself, Jake puts his two studio victims 
through the paces and makes sure they're in proper form. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of Shape: I wasn't in proper form. Despite Jake's motto, "Don't quit," I 
did. I didn't find his set, with its sky-blue carpeting, at all appealing. The 
15-minute class is too short for a serious workout. Can you believe I wanted 
more pushups?

 EVERYDAY WORKOUT 
</P>
<P>
 Monday-Friday, 7:30 a.m. Lifetime  
</P>
<P>
 * 1/2 
</P>
<P>
 The Workout: Want to learn how to count to 10 in Swedish, Hebrew, 
Mandarin-Chinese? Counting in different languages is a gimmick that Cynthia 
Kereluk, exercise physiologist and former Miss Canada, uses to get you through 
her often-monotonous aerobic workout, which incorporates floor work and a 
cool-down. 
</P>
<P>
 In Shape: During her S.O.S segments (Soft Odd Spots), Cynthia uses a 
split-screen to show herself doing a modification of the exercises for 
beginners and those with specific problems (lower back pain). And she 
encourages me to keep going through the commercials. 
</P>
<P>
 Out of Shape: This show, with Cynthia in her pastel leotard working out in her 
Pier 1 living room, had a retro feel. And there is no TV class to watch. The 
music reminds me of my dentist's office. Cynthia's breathy, sing-song voice is 
the opposite of motivating. "There you go," she coos. "You're doing a swell 
job." Made me want to cry "S.O.S."

<P>
 The Workout: No, that's not Josie Bissett and Doug Savant from "Melrose 
Place," although I did a double take. It's just Petra and Michael, your 
aerobics instructors. "Get funky, get loose," Petra yells at me with her 
British accent. A little intimidating. Then she gets nicer: "We're your 
friends. If you need someone to work out with, we're right here." 
</P>
<P>
 In Shape: Petra and a few other hipsters lead me through a high-energy workout 
featuring club music and dance moves set outdoors at the Ritz-Carlton 
Huntington hotel in Pasadena. They remind me to go at my own pace: "Remember, 
this is your thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Out of Shape: I can't get a grip on any of the instructors' personalities, 
which gives the show a generic feel. 
</P>
<P>
 LILIAS! 
</P>
<P>
 Mondays and Wednesdays, 7:30 a.m KOCE  
</P>
<P>
 *** 1/2 
</P>
<P>
 The Workout: If you want to join the latest fitness craze without paying for 
an expensive class, Lilias is your yoga master. After my high-powered TV 
workouts, it feels great to sprawl out on the rug and "inhale, exhale" as 
Lilias gets me ready for the warrior pose. "Don't force anything," Lilias says. 
I like that after all those motivators. 
</P>
<P>
 In shape: The relaxation segment is heavenly as Lilias tells me to slacken my 
jaw and relax "my good friend," the brain. She uses vivid imagery to convey the 
moves: "Fold like a piece of wet laundry" and "build a rainbow with your arms." 
</P>
<P>
 Out of Shape: When you're upside-down, it's hard to see the TV. I lost my 
balance more than a few times, but the maternal Lilias made me feel better: "If 
you start to wobble, that's fine." SOME OTHER SHOWS 
</P>
<P>
 FLEX MAGAZINE WORKOUT (ESPN): I'm not sure I want to look that pumped-up. 
Power weightlifters with names like Flex Wheeler and Boyer Coe go at it on the 
machines.

 CITY JAM (ESPN): A hip-hop class for the MTV generation edited to look like a 
music video -- with quick cuts and quirky camera angles. The dance moves are 
ultra-cool. If only I could do them. 
</P>
<P>
 SIT AND BE FIT (KVCR): Tone and stretch without getting out of the chair. Host 
Mary Ann Wilson provides a welcome alternative to super-charged TV classes. She 
gears the show to anybody who needs gentle movement, but the physically 
challenged and elderly are her targeted audience. 
</P>
<P>
 BASIC TRAINING (ESPN2): You're in the Navy now. A basic workout set on the 
dock in front of ships at Pearl Harbor. TV class members wear sailor hats and

NICE WORK IF YOU CAN GET IT; ONE PRESIDENT FALLS ILL AND ANOTHER FILLS THE 
VOID; FATHER'S DAY, BY JOHN CALVIN BATCHELOR (HENRY HOLT & CO.: $23; 528 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ross Thomas, Ross Thomas' latest novel is Ah, Treachery! (Mysterious Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Novels about political conspiracies of the peculiarly American kind are 
usually set in the indefinite future lest their plots be overshadowed by events 
such as Teapot Dome or Watergate or the Iran-Contra mess. 
</P>
<P>
 But John Calvin Batchelor has set "Father's Day," his intriguing novel of 
truly grand political conspiracies, in early 2003, which is slightly more than 
two years after the Democrats have again won not only the White House but also 
overwhelming majorities in the Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Democrats have a slight problem despite their victory. Although 
Theodore G. Jay, the former governor of Michigan, was elected the nation's 43rd 
President, and former Sen. T. E. Garland of Texas its vice-president, Jay's 
approval ratings have hit a post-Cold War low. And Jay himself has collapsed 
with "a disability diagnosed as a major depressive episode" and been carried 
off to Walter Reed hospital. This leaves the nation -- under the provisions of 
the 25th Amendment -- with its first acting President, T. E. Garland. 
</P>
<P>
 The new acting President is one of those cunning, larger-than-life Texans who 
might be a parody had we not already been blessed with so many of them -- from 
Texas Jack Garner, F.D.R.'s first vice-president, to Lyndon Johnson to the 
redoubtable Ann Richards, governor of the Lone Star State. 
</P>
<P>
 Garland indeed happens to be a nephew of L.B.J. and had sought his party's 
nomination for himself only to be defeated in the primaries by President Jay. 
But no one deep down really wants to be vice-president and we learn almost 
immediately that Garland, with the help of those two reliable political 
retainers, fair means or foul, is determined that the disabled Jay will never 
move back into the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair means would require strict adherence to the 25th Amendment. Its legal 
niceties provide that a disabled President's right to resume office can be 
successfully challenged by the acting President if this challenge is supported 
by the Cabinet and a two-thirds majority in both houses of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Garland is convinced he has these votes in his pocket. But just in case, there 
is a foul means fall-back that would result in Jay's assassination. The 
problem, as always, is where does one find a reliable assassin? 
</P>
<P>
 In far-off Moldova is where -- in that former constituent republic of the 
Soviet Union, bordering on Romania until the breakup of the U.S.S.R. Now it's 
an independent republic occupied in part by the U.S. Army's 10th Mountain 
Division. The designated assassin in Lt. Col. George M. "Red" Schofield, 
commander of the First Battalion of the division's 14th Regiment. 
</P>
<P>
 The assassination plot calls for much of the battalion to be secretly 
air-lifted back to the United States. There it will land, create a diversion 
and overpower the President's Secret Service detail. Colonel Schofield will 
then pull the trigger of the gun that kills the President. And this is exactly 
what he does in the novel's first chapter -- except it's a mock raid on a mock 
president carried out at Fort Chaffee, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
 After the raid, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Lucius S. 
Sensenbrenner, congratulates the Lieutenant Colonel and adds, "We're changing 
the designator for this operation from CAR ALARM to FATHER'S DAY. Don't think 
about it too hard. The go code is 'Happy Father's Day.' Understood?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Colonel understands and it appears that acting President Garland has not 
only the Congress and the Cabinet in his pocket, but also the Army, the Navy, 
the Air Force, the Marines and the Joint Chiefs of Staff. The military, it 
seems, is enraged because the defense budget has been slashed to a point where 
bullets are rationed, noncoms are on food-stamps and U.S. military might is a 
ghost of what it once was. 
</P>
<P>
 In fairness, it should be pointed out that the decline in the military's 
fortunes might not be entirely the fault of Jay, the disabled President. 
Batchelor makes him the 43rd President. Since Bill Clinton is the 42nd 
President, this means that Clinton must have won a second term although 
Batchelor doesn't touch on how this was accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Democrats in power but also in disarray and low in the polls, one 
wonders what the Republicans are doing to take advantage of such a rich 
opportunity? The answer lies in the state of Maine and its GOP governor, "John 
Gerry 'Jack' Longfellow, Jr., forty-eight, as fleet of sail and sure of tongue 
as any man ever took the helm of Blaine House at Augusta." This is Batchelor's 
own rather Down East description. 
</P>
<P>
 Governor Longfellow happens to be married to Sen. Jean Motherwell (R-Me.), who 
is the minority leader in the Senate in Washington and titular head of her 
party. Her husband has hopes of being the next Republican candidate for 
President. She has hopes of becoming the Senate's new majority leader. But 
unknown to her, he is having an affair with the widow of McAndrew Schofield 
whose baby brother is none other than Col. Schofield of the 10th Mountain 
Division and the Army's assassin apparent. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after this revelation, the supposedly invalid President announces his 
recovery and demands his job back. This ignites a tale of deadly conspiracy 
whose participants are an assortment of weird and wonderful characters. Not the 
least of them is the billionaire sheriff of Yuma County, Ariz., who has his own 
cable TV show called "Southwest Cooking With Sheriff Gus Keebler." The Sheriff 
uses the show to dispense recipes and also political gossip of the most vicious 
and scurrilous kind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Father's Day" offers a fascinating, if gloomy, vision of the world in 2003. 
Many of the principal characters seem to spend their waking hours with a 
cellular phone stuck in their ear, a pandemic scourge whose symptoms are 
already visible. Then, too, Europe is broke. Africa is lost. The Mideast is a 
shambles. Cairo has been leveled by an earthquake. The U.S. has two Preisdents. 
And Wall Street is in a dive. But still the Presidency and its semblance of 
power remains a job that some would kill for. 
</P>
<P>
 Batchelor writes smoothly, has done his research and has an ear for dialogue 
that's refreshing. "Father's Day" may be a plot-driven novel but it's also the 
plot of a master.

 N.F. Mendoza in her "Ocean Girl" article (TV Times, Oct. 16) quotes Disney 
programmers as saying that this Australian show, with its Australian locales 
and Australian sensibilities is not harmed too much by the "heavy Australian 
accents" of its Australian actors. Americans were very much involved in its 
production -- so we're safe.After all, it would be downright seditious to see a 
different corner of the world the way the locals see it -- they might not think 
exactly the same way we do. We might have to listen hard to understand -- and 
what's really scary is that we might learn something new. No wonder everyone 
else in the world thinks Americans are ugly; we are. I give you "Baywatch" -- 
take it, please.

PRIME-TIME FLICKS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Steve Martin has the depth with which to follow Spencer Tracy in the title 
role of Father of the Bride (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.), the 1991 remake of the 
memorable 1950 Vincente Minnelli movie. Unfortunately, Martin's flair for comic 
smugness is blunted in the misfired telling of this tale of a middle-aged man 
marrying off his daughter (Kimberly Williams). As a result, Martin Short, as an 
effete, snobbish wedding coordinator, steals the show. Even so, there may be 
enough laughs to please Martin fans. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1985 One Magic Christmas (KCAL Sunday at 10 p.m.), a modern Christmas 
parable from Disney that is set in Canada, is a film you approach gingerly 
because you want it to work, even though it doesn't quite make it. Mary 
Steenburgen stars as a woman who's endured too much to retain her Christmas 
spirit, but she has a little daughter (Elizabeth Harnois) who makes magical 
contact with both Santa and a Guardian Angel (Harry Dean Stanton, no less). 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the elements in a comedy fuse magically, and everything works. 
That's the case with Ron Howard's 1984 hit romantic comedy Splash (KTLA Monday 
at 8 p.m.), in which Tom Hanks falls in love with mermaid Daryl Hannah. 
</P>
<P>
 Twins (KTLA Tuesday at 8 p.m.), an overblown, self-destructing 1988 
comedy-thriller wastes Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito as twins 
separated at birth. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1986 Ruthless People (KTLA Wednesday at 8 p.m.) is that delicious L.A. 
satire in which the lives of a nouveau riche Beverly Hills couple (Bette 
Midler, Danny DeVito) are turned upside down when a desperate young couple 
(Judge Reinhold, Helen Slater) kidnap Midler only to discover that DeVito 
doesn't want her back at any price. 
</P>
<P>
 Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory (ABC Saturday at 8 p.m.), the 1971 film 
of the late Roald Dahl's children's classic "Charlie and the Chocolate 
Factory," has as its principal strength Gene Wilder in the title role. His 
performance as the nutty candy-bar maker from Bavaria is wonderfully sly and 
subtle in this tale of a worldwide contest to turn up five children to tour 
mysterious Willy's mysterious candy works. Wilder's presence helps offset 
Anthony Newley and Leslie Bricusse's songs, which are not much better than 
perky, and a disappointingly literal factory set. 
</P>
<P>
 In the excellent, intimate 1991 The Quarrel (KCET Saturday at 11 p.m.), 
passion and principle collide memorably as two old friends and enemies (Saul 
Rubinek, R.H. Thomson), Holocaust survivors both, meet unexpectedly in a 
Montreal park on Rosh Hashanah. Complications are large, for like the Jewish 
culture it tries to encapsulate in 88 minutes, this film balances philosophical 
issues with the warmer, earthier bonds of life.

 WHO'S WRITING THIS? Notations on the Authorial I edited by Daniel Halpern 
(Ecco Press: $22; 185 pp.) "I live, I agree to go on living, so that Borges may 
fashion his literature"; so wrote Jorge Luis Borges in "Borges and I," his 
famous reflection on the ambiguous relationship between a writer's person and 
his persona, his private self and his public voice. It was a minor stroke of 
genius for Daniel Halpern, poet and proprietor of Ecco Press, to ask scores of 
thoughtful writers to set down their own appreciations of Borges' theme; how 
could they resist taking on one of literature's most difficult, most avoided 
questions? There are few duds among these 57 brief essays, most of the authors 
beguiled by the opportunity to lament the damages of literary fame, acknowledge 
alienation toward their previously published work, confess that readers are a 
necessary evil. Gail Godwin compares her writing self to a vampire, "constantly 
venturing abroad to gorge on lives that are not mine"; Allan Gurganus contrasts 
his "public gasbag author" skin with the one in which he is more comfortable, 
that of the "cringing, self-critical, hyper-private writer"; Susan Sontag 
reports that most practiced writers eventually feel themselves possessed by a 
secret sharer, "both Dr. Frankenstein and the monster"; James Salter calls his 
non-writing side "a caddie" to his more public alter-ego, knowing "everything 
about him and as much about the game." More, probably. "Who's Writing This?" 
will appeal primarily to other writers, but few of the essays are insular, 
applicable only to the scribbling trade.When Cecil Brown writes of the 
incompatibility between his tobacco-town, black homeboy self who says "You 
dig?" and the educated, writer self he displays at parties, or Cynthia Ozick 
embodies her Borgesian division through a story about separated Siamese twins, 
their schizophrenia will strike a chord in many readers.

 MANHOLE COVERS text by Mimi Melnick, photographs by Robert A. Melnick (The MIT 
Press: $39.95: 272 pp.). Both everyday and otherworldly, their sturdy and 
somehow beautiful iron forms hinting of passages to destinations best left 
unknown, manhole covers have at last found their champions.The Melnicks' 
interest began with a desire to have something to hang over their sofa, and 
though the 300-pound weight proved a formidable deterrent to decorative use, 
the couple persevered in photographing and researching their subjects, turning 
out an earlier and now apparently classic book, "Manhole Covers of Los Angeles" 
in 1974. The current volume, beautifully produced by the same press that 
published the industrial strength "Gas Tanks," "Water Towers" and "Blast 
Furnaces" by Bernd and Hilla Becher, has more than 200 quite fascinating 
examples from around the country, organized by category. There's also a hoard 
of manhole and sewer lore and wry personal tales like the phone call from a 
friend during a rash of cover thefts in 1990 asking archly, "Mimi, are you 
redecorating again ?" Melnick is forced to end on a sad note, bemoaning "the 
stagnation of manhole cover art" and admitting that "rare is the new lid that 
arrests, that surprises, that grabs the eye." Sic transit gloria mundi , 
indeed. Kenneth Turan

 THE STYLE'S THE MAN: Reflections on Proust, Fitzgerald, Wharton, Vidal, and 
Others by Louis Auchincloss (Charles Scribner's Sons: $21; 177 pp.). Louis 
Auchincloss had chosen an appropriate title for his most recent collection of 
critical essays; in most of these 18 articles he's interested in divining some 
connection between a writer and his or her art, the attitude a creator takes 
toward characters or a work's ability to shed light on its author. 
Reconsidering "Remembrance of Things Past," Auchincloss wonders why Proust 
hides his narrator's homosexuality while making it obvious in most other 
characters; musing on Congreve, he finds the playwright surprisingly tolerant 
of bad behavior, heroes and villains alike seeming to "strut with astounding 
arrogance around a sleazy barnyard." These points are minor but interesting, 
and they fit the small canvas Auchincloss generally works in this volume, 
seeking out literary nooks and crannies that bear further exploration. Often, 
however, Auchincloss draws too broadly, taking on entire careers -- those of 
William Gaddis, Marguerite Yourcenar -- and says little worth preserving. He 
deals with Fitzgerald and "The Great Gatsby" in seven paragraphs, for example, 
and although the sketch isn't exactly trivial, it hardly warrants mention in 
the book's subtitle. The best essays in "The Style's the Man" concern 
lesser-known work where Auchincloss doesn't risk beating a dead horse, such as 
"Henry James: The Theatre Years" and especially "The Lyttleton -- Hart-Davis 
Letters." In the latter Auchincloss appraises the correspondence between a 
retired Eton house-master and a former student turned book-editor, and it's a 
graceful celebration of a thoughtful, considered intimacy that seems destined 
for extinction in this virtual Electronic Age.

 THE DROWNT BOY: An Ozark Tale by Art Homer (University of Missouri Press: 
$19.95; 155 pp.). Art Homer grew up in the Missouri Ozarks in the 1950s, son of 
subsistence farmers, but from an adult perspective his boyhood seemed cut from 
a different age, as if the Great Depression had "moved into the Ozarks, liked 
it, and retired there. . . ." "The Drownt Boy" is Homer's bid to reclaim that 
time, as told through a three-day canoe trip he takes with his stepson, Reese, 
on a flooded Missouri river.It's a lyrical evocation of a singular, outmoded 
way of life, somewhat marred by asides and abstractions that distract from the 
book's two intertwined voyages -- on occasionally dangerous water in the 
present, and into the equally dangerous but nostalgia-tinged memories of the 
past. Homer, a teacher at the University of Nebraska, writes most effectively 
of childhood -- collecting ant-lions and chicken eggs, watching his father 
scythe the front yard to deter snakes; and the canoe trip likewise provides 
good material -- river-rangers looking for a "drownt" child, car-campers 
deposited in treetops by high, violent water. To reach the good parts of "The 
Drownt Boy," though, you must slog through some stuffy philosophical and 
etymological, not enty -, discourses -- Homer admits to having been called 
"professor" as a child -- which make a very short book seem too long. One 
hopes, for Reese's sake, that Homer was more closed-mouthed during the canoe 
trip itself.

 VODOUN: A Novel by David Madsen (William Morrow: $23; 369 pp.). When you read 
a novel involving voodoo, you expect a certain amount of implausibility.In this 
case, though, you're likely to shake your head in disbelief not during the 
scenes involving occult religious rites but at the adolescent narcissism of its 
narrator and his improbable appeal to women. Ray Falco, a respected 
investigative reporter, has burned out on the corrupt-politician beat, but is 
brought out of retirement by an irresistible urge to track down the origins of 
a loup- garou -- the Haitian werewolf, who leaves his skin behind as warning or 
prophecy. Falco soon ferrets out the werewolf's intended prey, exiled Haitian 
politico Jean-Mars Baptiste -- and immediately kills him, to the reporter's 
surprise as much as Baptiste's. Falco, it seems, has become a zombie in book 
galleys, and "Vodoun" describes his attempt to track down the man who stole his 
free will before Falco is again compelled to kill at his tormentor's command. 
The path leads to Haiti, of course; requires Falco to team up with a smart, 
beautiful Haitian, of course; involves Washington skulduggery and cynical 
journalistic wisecracking, also of course. The novelty of "Vodoun" lies in 
Falco's particular possession, for his soul has been overtaken by that of a 
young U.S. diplomat, Nicholas Townsend, sent to Port-au-Prince in 1792 to 
assess the slave revolt on Saint Domingue; during his intermittent zombie 
states Falco is compelled to transcribe Townsend's diary, including his capture 
and alliance with slave leader General Charlemagne. The novel is surely more 
campy than L.A. resident David Madsen intended -- "Vodoun, again tapping into 
my truest, deepest desire to get the story or die trying" -- but "Vodoun's" 
campiness, in the end, allows the reader to forgive Madsen's often overwrought 
prose and Falco's abidingly oversized ego.

 PARADISE OVERDOSE by Brian Antoni (Simon & Schuster: $21; 251 pp.). Robin, an 
artist who has come to the Bahamas for a last-ditch cancer treatment, at one 
point tells Chris Angostura, her newly acquired, Anglo-Caribbean lover, "I 
refuse to pity someone who has everything but does nothing."The statement isn't 
exactly accurate; Chris has many activities, but they are largely limited to 
spear-fishing, sailing his yacht, snorting enormous amounts of cocaine and 
indulging in constant, meaningless sex. Chris, in short, is not a very 
interesting character -- a major problem for a novel in which he plays the 
protagonist, and for whom it is difficult to feel not merely pity but anything 
at all. Brian Antoni has an extraordinary tale to tell -- in real life he's 
heir to a Trinidad- and Bahamas-made fortune, son to a white doctor in a 
largely black community, brother to an award-winning writer and a 
near-notorious young artist -- but it comes through badly in this disguised and 
displaced fiction. Frequent and steamy sex scenes hardly make "Paradise 
Overdose" seem sentimental, but at bottom it's a warm-water "Love Story" in 
which a dying woman's love saves a man from squandered talent and emotional 
anomie. Chris acts either like a child or an automaton; Robin is an idealized, 
unbelievable Artist, a fictionalized version of the author's sister Janine 
(best known for her mastication of chocolate and lard). The one compelling 
relationship in the novel is that between Chris and Shark, son of the Angostura 
family's black housekeeper, for it shows starkly how Chris, being white and 
rich, has a limitless future, while Shark, being black and poor, has little to 
lose. That's a theme worth further exploration in nonfiction, and one for which 
Antoni is well qualified.

 Thank you for the "Five Mrs. Buchanans," Saturday nights on CBS.It is one of 
the best comedies out there, and the characters are superb. Though Eileen 
Heckart and Judith Ivey steal the show, with their clipped, well-timed humor, 
each character really does a great job. 
</P>
<P>
 That's saying a lot for CBS, because most of the time there isn't much to 
watch on that network. We have "The Nanny," and "Dave's World," but the "Five 
Mrs. Buchanans" are by far the best and funniest on TV right now (besides 
"Frasier").

 35 Up (Bravo Sunday at 8 p.m.) is the latest -- 1991 -- installment in Michael 
Apted's startling and unique series of five British documentaries that started 
with "Seven Up" in 1964.Every seven years Apted checks in on the lives of 14 
children from the age of 7 who represent a cross-section of society. 
</P>
<P>
 La Femme Nikita (Bravo Saturday at 6 p.m. and midnight), Luc Besson's 1990 
imitation high-tech urban thriller, follows the rules only to subvert them into 
a feminist fable. The result is shallow, sometimes silly, but Anne Parillaud, 
in the title role, is riveting as a free-lance murderer turned government 
agent.

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR CHILDREN TOO; 'TOON TOWN KIDS' OFFERS A FUN 
ALTERNATIVE TO THIS BROADCAST MAJOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One piece of advice most casting directors give aspiring actors is not to 
answer ads in the back of magazines touting modeling or acting schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Toon Town Kids" star Liza Del Mundo, 19, didn't heed any such advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Del Mundo, who stars alongside co-host Trevor Lissauer ("The Skateboard Kid") 
in the weekday Disney morning show, wanted to be a model at 15. "I went through 
the modeling thing, went to Barbizon after I saw a magazine ad, had my pictures 
taken, took classes and then realized I wasn't model material." 
</P>
<P>
 At 5-foot-1, the Filipina American was too short. "I was always entering 
myself in teen model search things and I would make the finals, but never win." 
</P>
<P>
 While in high school in San Diego, she persuaded her parents -- Mom is a 
realtor, Dad is a lieutenant commander in the U.S. Navy -- to drive her up to 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw one of those magazine ads for a showcase," says Del Mundo, now a 
freshman at Cal State Northridge. She was asked to walk up on the stage, say 
her name and say she was really happy to be there. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were something like 1,000 of us there. After that, they chose 50 of us 
to go to acting school in Beverly Hills." Del Mundo's mother drove her every 
weekend for three months to attend an all-day Saturday acting class at Powers 
Development Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Workshops and showcase appearances at the center garnered her an agent and 
manager, which led to guest roles -- on "Hearts Afire" and "My So-Called Life" 
-- and eventually her "Toon Town" role. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixty-five episodes were shot at Disneyland in a period of six weeks. "We 
lived at the Disneyland Hotel and it was great," Del Mundo says. "An average 
day was 16 hours. Disneyland was like our huge set and it was very hard. Even 
if you're tired and up since 4 a.m. and there is a big crowd around you, you 
had to make sure you looked happy." 
</P>
<P>
 According to executive producer, writer and director Mark Israel, "The best 
thing about Liza is her youthful, animated voice, something young kids can 
relate to. It's almost like a cartoon voice." 
</P>
<P>
 Israel also points out that "she's completely non-threatening, but the strong 
one" in the Lucy-Desi dynamic he tried to establish between Lissauer and Del 
Mundo. And, he says, "she has one of the most beautiful smiles any director can 
ask for." 
</P>
<P>
 The broadcast journalism student, now housed at the university's dorm, thought 
she might change her major to theater after her "Toon Town" stint, but her 
mother advised her otherwise. "She told me, 'Liza, you don't have to have a 
degree to become a star. It could end any minute.' School keeps my feet on the 
ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Del Mundo continues to audition, but finds being a Filipina both a positive 
and negative in the entertainment industry. "Sometimes they (casting folk) are 
looking for just ethnicity, and then you have a good chance at it, but then 
you're often limited to a minor role." 
</P>
<P>
 With her "Toon Town" gig and a couple of national commercials -- one for 
Polaroid and another for Burger King (she's the "weema-weh" girl) -- under her 
belt, Del Mundo is ready to take on the acting world, but will keep school as a 
backup. "You never know what will happen," she says with a sigh. 
</P>
<P>
 The "Toon Town Kids" offer comedic skits between Disney cartoon classics. 
"Toon Town Kids" airs daily at 8 a.m. on KCAL. For ages 2 to 8. More Family 
Fare 
</P>
<P>
 The classic tale of "Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer," narrated by Burl Ives 
and based on the popular song by Johnny Marks, airs Tuesday at 8 p.m. on CBS. A 
day after watching the story of the shy reindeer and his heroic red beacon, 
tune into "Frosty the Snowman," Wednesday at 8 p.m. on CBS. For ages 2 and up.

CHILDREN'S BOOKSHELF: A TRIP THROUGH A HANDS-ON 'MUSEUM'

 Zap! Whizbang! Kapowie! Snickerdoodle! Whoopie! Snurflebabaroonie! 
</P>
<P>
 Whew -- now that I got that out of my system I feel better. Those are just a 
few of the words that flood my mind whenever I pick up EARTHSEARCH by John 
Cassidy (Klutz Press: $19.95) , one of the most entertaining -- and educational 
-- books to ever cross my desk. 
</P>
<P>
 Subtitled "A Kids' Geography Museum in a Book," this work is meant to be 
approached as if you were wandering through a museum. Every time you find an 
exhibit that appeals to you, start touching, poking, shaking, playing with the 
stuff that catches your interest. 
</P>
<P>
 And there's a lot that will catch and hold your interest, "Earthsearch" being 
one of those rare books that merits a big hats-off salute to the book 
design/graphics/illustration team. The cover is made from recycled aluminum, 
which leads to a section on recycling, which offers a chance to enter the Klutz 
Light Metal Fiction Contest (write your own "Lives of a Pop Can" story), which 
leads to a discussion of dumps, which leads to the piece of toilet paper 
between Page 18 and Page 19 (the page with the population clock), which leads 
to a look at germs, population growth, maps of the world, perspective, the 
"Lost on Earth" game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Wait, there's more, much more! The cutout to make a tennis ball globe, the 
guide to draw the knuckle ( your knuckle) contour range map, the solar system 
in your back yard (you'll need a soccer ball for this), the penny game that 
will make you a millionaire! (maybe), the spinner game that just may make the 
kids appreciate all the good things that they have, the coins from eight 
different countries that need to find their way home. 
</P>
<P>
 As author Cassidy puts it, "We tried to get a full-court press here, a 
hands-on museum that gets away from ink-on-paper, which is fairly passive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was aiming for true multimedia -- kids learn through all their senses, 
through their ears and nose and mouth, by touching and doing. We figured if we 
got through to as many senses as possible, we'd be reaching them." 
</P>
<P>
 "Earthsearch" took four years from conception to completion. Cassidy admits 
with a laugh that "I may have overcooked that one, my own little 'Apocalypse 
Now.' The printer sort of balked at first but finally came around." 
</P>
<P>
 Of such obsessiveness are great books born. "Earthsearch" is a gem. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The only "activity" you and your kids get from THEM BONES by Ian Dicks and 
David Hawcock (Delacorte Press: $13.95) will be the best kind: a good giggle. 
All you do with this simple charming piffle is pull out and fold down the 
skeleton while singing "thigh bone's connected to the knee bone" and so on. And 
you can hang it on the wall when you're done.

 Wednesday, Nov. 3, 1994 A few days after her 75th birthday, Doris Lessing 
reads for the Lannan Foundation to promote her new book, "Under My Skin, Volume 
One of My Autobiography to 1949." 
</P>
<P>
 Waiting for the sold-out reading to begin, we page through the book, look at 
photographs of a young Lessing. She gazes back with a frank, mischievous 
intelligence, looking exactly like a girl who could burn down a farm storehouse 
"because of an error of judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 The same dark, lively gaze greets us shortly as Lessing, gray-haired and calm, 
steps to the podium. 
</P>
<P>
 Writing this book, she says, gave her a keen awareness of the tension between 
family saga and memory. There's family pressure "to make children remember 
things they don't actually remember." She reads about how, at age 5, she 
traveled with her family from Persia to England via Moscow. At one station, her 
mother left the train to buy food and was left behind. The family saga recalls 
2 days of worry and her mother's spunk; her own memories are more personal, 
mixed, emotional: faces of hungry people in the train windows, her one-legged 
father's helplessness, the way she compulsively dressed and undressed her teddy 
bear. 
</P>
<P>
 Lessing regards the autobiographical enterprise with skepticism. "I learnt a 
great deal writing this book," she says. "The tricks of a novelist get into 
autobiography. But novels have shape and an internal coherence, which 
autobiography should not. Life is a big sprawling mess full of false 
beginnings. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Memory, too, is slippery. "I remembered far too much to put into this book . . 
. and even if you remember a great deal, it's nothing to what there is to 
remember. . . . Memory is so slight, so unreliable an organ. . . . Any incident 
can be described half a dozen ways, all of them true. Choose one and the other 
five disappear. . . ." On the other hand, memory is clearly selective: "You 
remember things if you were particularly alert or alive or awake at the time." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was under very heavy pressure to have opinions not my own foisted on my 
childhood," Lessing says. "I was determined not to be got at." 
</P>
<P>
 We see such determination as she fields questions from the interviewer. 
</P>
<P>
 No, she says, she did not become a writer because of a difficult childhood. "I 
became a writer because I couldn't do anything else. . . . I don't think this 
is uncommon for women: writing because you can't do anything else is really 
part of the women's (literary) tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 No, she does not feel her work was protected from critical literary appraisal 
because it was embraced by feminism or labeled science fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 No, she did not work to improve the dialogue in her novels because the 
literary critic Irving Howe pronounced it "wooden" in an essay on "The Golden 
Notebook." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, Lessing regards her prolific output with detached affection. " 
'Marriages (Between Zones Three, Four and Five)' is a good book," she says. " 
'Jocasta' had problems. 'The Sirian Experiments' still makes me laugh -- I read 
it the other day." "The Golden Notebook" received "botchy" reviews, but has a 
vitality of its own -- "I just watch it with interest."

 IT'S THE THOUGHT THAT COUNTS: For Better or For Worse 15th Anniversary 
Collection by Lynn Johnston (Andrews & McMeel: $12.95; 230 pp., paperback 
original). Over the last decade and a half, "For Better or for Worse" has 
developed into an intelligent, inclusive portrait of family life in North 
America in the late 20th Century. Like Frank King ("Gasoline Alley"), Johnston 
allows her characters to age and refuses to tie every story up neatly. In a 
series of interesting notes, she comments on events in her life that influenced 
specific strips, and discusses audience reactions to the controversial series 
in which one of her teen-age characters revealed he was gay.

 RETURN OF THE EAGLE: How America Saved Its National Symbol text by Greg 
Breining, photographs by Frank Oberele and others (The Nature 
Conservancy/Falcon: $19.95; 126 pp., paperback original). In 1963, fewer than 
500 nesting pairs of bald eagles remained in the lower 48 states. Over-hunting, 
habitat destruction and pesticides had decimated a species that had once ranged 
over the entire North American continent: The American government had to place 
its national symbol on the Endangered Species list. The elimination of bounties 
and some toxic chemicals -- and the work of dedicated conservationists -- have 
produced an ecological success story: The eagle population has grown to 16,000. 
This handsome book shows that properly enforced environmental activism can 
work.

 THE PRIMAL CHEESEBURGER: A Generous Helping of Food History Served Up on a Bun 
by Elisabeth Rozin (Penguin: $8.95; 230 pp., paperback original). Rozin argues 
that a cheeseburger with fries and a Coke is the quintessential American meal: 
One that the nation's citizens consume in staggering numbers and export 
throughout the world. She discusses each component (meat, bun, condiments, 
etc.) offering brief histories and comments, concluding that the cheeseburger 
offers a particularly appealing combination of red meat and fat: foods that 
were long restricted to the tables of the wealthy.

 DESPERATE WOMEN NEED TO TALK TO YOU by Joan Frank (Conari Press: $9.95; 146 
pp., paperback original). In this collection of columns from various 
periodicals, Joan Frank bemoans the daily life of an aging Baby-Boomer in New 
York: the search for romance, questioning goals, the death of parents, the 
biological timepiece, etc. Her "Girlfriend, I just can't cope" tone is often 
amusing, but many other writers are working the same turf these days, and she 
offers little that's new or insightful.

 THE WASHINGTON ALMANAC by Lawrence J. Haas (Henry Holt: $25; 669 pp.) and THE 
RATING GUIDE TO LIFE IN THE AMERICA'S FIFTY STATES by G. Scott Thomas 
(Prometheus: $19.95; 575 pp., paperback original). As election results indicate 
with depressing regularity, large numbers of Americans either ignore their 
government or decline to participate in it.In his newly revised almanac, 
Lawrence Haas presents a great deal of information about who in Washington 
wields power in the specific areas of education, housing, the elderly, the 
environment, etc. Each chapter includes addresses, phone numbers and capsule 
biographies of senior Congressional committee members, executive branch 
personel and heads of important non-governmental bodies. If American voters are 
truly frustrated with the way the government functions, "Washington Almanac" 
provides a starting point for implementing change. In contrast, "Rating" 
epitomizes the factoids Americans consume in place of real information. Working 
from the dubious premise that the quality of life in a place can be determined 
statistically, Thomas juggles figures -- from the number of Olympic athletes 
per million residents to the sites listed in the National Register of Historic 
Places -- to determine the "best" place to live. Vermont wins the mathematical 
contest, with California coming in 10th. Thomas' rating system bears the same 
relationship to real knowledge of the 50 states that fast food does to real 
food.

'THAT ANTEROOM OF GIRLHOOD'; WHO WILL RUN THE FROG HOSPITAL? BY LORRIE MOORE 
(ALFRED A. KNOPF: $20; 148 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Eric Larsen, Eric Larsen is author of the novels An American Memory and I Am 
Zoe Handke. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Benoit-Marie Carr, remembering her 15th year and about to tell the story of 
it, announces what sounds like the considerable disadvantage that, "My 
childhood had no narrative." She comments that that time of her life "was all 
just a combination of air and no air," a "waiting for life to happen," having 
"no stories, no ideas, not really, not yet." It was, she says at last, "just a 
space with some people in it." 
</P>
<P>
 And there you are. If I were a teacher of fiction writing -- dread but 
conceivable thought -- I'd point my students to this page and say, there, 
that's what fiction is about, that's what it is -- a space with some people in 
it -- that's where you start, where you go from and where you end. 
</P>
<P>
 Which, obviously, is a fact already perfectly well known to the 
extraordinarily talented Lorrie Moore, making it only more puzzling that she 
allows to be woven into this, her fourth book and second novel, as many thin 
and people-less strands as she does. 
</P>
<P>
 What Benoit-Marie, Berie for short, really has to tell here is the story of 
her intense friendship with the wonderfully named Silsby Chaussee. Inseparable 
from age 9, the girls reached 15 -- in 1972, the novel's pivotal year -- at 
stages of physical development so different that Sils "looked twenty," while 
Berie "looked twelve." Suffice it to say that Berie envied and treasured not 
only the womanly loveliness of Sils, but also the tough confidence with which 
she smoked, swore and swaggered around home, school and town -- or that when 
Sils got pregnant that year (via Mike, a tough local boy with a Harley), Berie 
stood by her dear friend as few others might, stealing the $500 needed for an 
abortion and, herself, paying the considerable price. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as Lorrie Moore follows her own implied dictum and keeps the space of 
her book honestly peopled, she presents the lives of Sils and Berie and the 
atmosphere of the Upstate New York town they lived in with a subtle, moving and 
often outright brilliance. With seeming ease she offers up such details as Sils 
and Berie's habit of meeting in the cemetery behind Sil's house ("at the grave 
of Esterina Foster, a little girl who had died in 1932"), where the two would 
smoke and talk and "lean forward and brush hair from each other's face;" or the 
fleeting, tiny, but typically Mooreian detail that Berie's distracted but 
idealistic father, visiting Germany in 1930, "had seen Hitler in a hotel lobby 
and was dazzled." 
</P>
<P>
 When the scene moves away from home, though, especially in those interpolated 
sections of the novel set years later (when Berie is to be married -- and Sils 
still has no prospects), Moore's pages often grow thin, occupied not so much by 
people as by oddly half-emerged attitudes, stances or themes seemingly there 
for some kind of imagined but unnecessary support. 
</P>
<P>
 The author reveals signs of a lack of confidence in her material with a 
sometimes self-conscious leaning, for example, on symbol. Often enough, Moore's 
symbols work beautifully -- the cemetery lying behind Sil's house, or the 
girls' hometown being named Horsehearts because, during the French and Indian 
War (the town is near the Canadian border), slaughtered horses were thrown into 
the local ponds, their eviscerated hearts "buried on Miller Hill just south." 
Backdrop symbols of danger, brutality and threat like these are sometimes 
interesting in themselves and can add texture to the book; yet the considerable 
and engaging personages of Berie and (even less so) of Sils don't need them. 
Moore usually throttles back in time to avoid excess, controlling her tone and 
keeping the ring of her story true, but there are interesting moments when even 
she seems to telegraph suggestions of doubt about her judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 Small quibbles and doubts, perhaps, in a book capable of being as rich, 
articulate and evocative of its characters' life as this one is. Few writers 
can hope to achieve effects so simple, perfectly timed and moving as Moore's 
having Sils, confused and in pain just after her abortion, almost forgetting to 
turn around and wave back at Berie as she's driven off on Mike's motorcycle; or 
as the exquisitely understated pathos of Berie's feelings on the deaths of her 
father and of her grandmother; or, at the thematic heart of the novel, as the 
sorrow that comes simply through growing into adulthood and losing the things 
-- as Berie loses Sils -- that once seemed to have been perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 All the more disappointing, then, are the inexplicably supercilious scenes of 
Berie in Paris with her two-dimensional husband, or of Berie, in that same 
city, feverishly museum-hopping, name-dropping and editorializing about the 
evils of the French while in the company of her cipher-friend Marguerite, a 
trendy and paper-thin wisp who seems to have been conjured out of air just to 
make a certain number of pages of these time-and-space-filling, fashion-plate 
scenes possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Berie's adult unhappiness, as if hardly a part of the same book, is in great 
part penuriously and immaturely rendered, for reasons that one can only guess 
at, or theorize about only at much greater length than this. The novel's end, 
though, for a 10-year high school reunion, returns to Horsehearts, where Lorrie 
Moore also returns once more to the genuine article, palpably filling her space 
again with people, touching on one perfect detail after another, and moving her 
readers by an art woven out of the unpretentious stuff of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Berie, at this point, says something extraordinary, and perhaps also relevant 
to the weaknesses -- and the great strengths -- of Lorrie Moore's novel. 
Although engaged to be married, Berie finds herself looking less to the future 
than wanting the past back again, wanting not adulthood but "another part of my 
life: that anteroom of girlhood, with . . . anticipation playing in the heart 
like an orchestra tuning and warming, the notes unwed and fabulous and crazed 
-- I wanted it back! -- those beginning sounds, so much more interesting than 
the piece itself." 
</P>
<P>
 The reader will want the same: to have back the authentic parts that ring so 
true, the parts at the starting out more than the whole piece itself.

 TWILIGHT OF THE IDOLS: Recollections of a Lost Yugoslavia by Ales Debeljack, 
translated from the Slovenian by Michael Biggins, photographs by Elizabeth 
Rappaport (White Pine Press: $10; 83 pp . , paperback original). In this 
eloquent essay, the Central European poet denounces politicians who celebrate 
diversity while ignoring the brutal war in the Balkans. Decrying the 
destruction of the eclectic society that existed in the former Yugoslavia, 
Debeljack declares, "We were the ones who learned in the hardest way possible 
that the masses on Europe's periphery, if not in its heart, don't give a damn 
for reasoned co-existence in a diverse society." Although he recognizes the 
restrictions that existed under Tito, he argues that a truly diverse culture 
existed then, with members of various ethnic and religious groups living in 
mutual tolerance, if not harmony.

 Actor Jerry Douglas anticipates that fans of "The Young and the Restless" -- 
and particularly of his fine, upstanding character, John Abbott -- are 
rejoicing over his current story turn: John's split from his conniving younger 
wife, Jill. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have been coming up to me for years saying, 'Do you know how evil that 
Jill is? She's disgusting. You ought to get rid of her,' " recounts Douglas 
with a laugh. "They lecture me constantly. I sit there and say, 'Yeah, you're 
right. Thank you.' That's generally the rule of thumb. They constantly tell me 
how foolish I am to not see through her. They don't understand how a fine man 
like John could be married to such a trampy woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, at long last, the mismatched characters are headed for a divorce, 
delighting not only fans but Douglas and co-star Jess Walton (who plays Jill). 
</P>
<P>
 "This is some of the best writing we've ever had to do," maintains Douglas, 
who also admitted that it was difficult to play at first. "Jess Walton and I 
are such good friends that it was hard for us to be mean to one another," he 
says. "Plus, it was difficult in the beginning for us to play the anger and 
frustration the characters felt toward each other, because -- no matter what -- 
there are certain relationships that (head writer) Bill Bell has developed so 
long over so many years that they'll always care for each other. There's always 
a love, and they'll probably find some way back to it down the line. He does 
that with John and Jill, Victor and Nikki, and certain core characters." 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas shares that special kind of love off-camera with his real-life wife, 
Kymberly Bankier. The pair, who celebrated their 10th wedding anniversary in 
April, have proved that a May/September union can thrive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love Kymberly very much," says Douglas, as if still a newlywed. "Her 
happiness means everything to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas met Kymberly more than a decade ago when she was a journalist and 
anchorwoman in Detroit. She put her career on hold and moved to Los Angeles to 
marry him. However, of late, Douglas notes that his wife "has gotten back to 
what she really loves to do. She's doing a lot of infommercials as the host and 
broadcaster and is doing great. She did one with some soap-opera actors and 
Dionne Warwick for Psychic Friends Network, which is by far the largest 900 
call-in number in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 His wife's new career twist inspired Douglas to recently create a company with 
some friends to provide a 900 call-in number for devoted daytime fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's called 'Soap Stars Talk 2-U' and features personal, prerecorded 
interviews with seven of us -- myself, Jess, Don Diamont (Brad Carlton), J. 
Eddie Peck (Cole Howard), Kristoff St. John (Neal Winters), and Lauralee Bell 
(Christine Blair)," explains Douglas. "Kymberly conducted all the interviews. 
They're fun to listen to because you can talk about things that you can never 
really relate in an article. You never can print what you can say in a 
five-minute interview. It's hard." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Young and the Restless" airs weekdays at 11 a.m. on CBS.

 This landmark 1951 John Huston adventure-romance, adapted by film critic James 
Agee and Huston from C.S. Forester's novel, unforgettably teamed Humphrey 
Bogart as a seedy drunk and Katharine Hepburn as a missionary's starchy 
spinster sister. They are thrown together as they flee, via boat, the Germans 
in Africa during World War I. Bogart won an Oscar for his efforts and Hepburn 
received from Huston the movies' most famous directorial advice when he 
suggested that, in playing her role, she think of Eleanor Roosevelt (TBS, 
Wednesday at 10:05 a.m.).

<TEXT>

 Adapted by physicist and popular science author Fritjof Capra and directed by 
his brother Bernt, this 1991 release is mainly an absorbing discourse on the 
world. The movie unfolds in the conversations between three people roaming the 
French isle of Mont. St. Michel.They are a vacationing Democratic senator (Sam 
Waterston), an expatriate poet (John Heard) and a physicist (Liv Ullmann, 
pictured) who has cut herself off from the world. The backgrounds of sea, sky 
and castle not only give greater presence to the conversation -- as does Philip 
Glass' minimalist score -- but also act as a metaphor for the kind of society 
Ullmann says is lost. The one hitch in the film, which targets environmental 
wreckers and robotized governments, is thatit is most likely to appeal to 
people who already agree with it (Bravo, Sunday at 5 p.m., again at 11:30 
p.m.). Michael Wilmington

 The spirit of Jean Renoir seems to hover over Colin Nutley's funny and 
endearing 1992 film set in a Swedish village, the perfect spot to observe 
timeless human comedy.The village is rocked when an entertainer (Helena 
Bergstrom, pictured, with Rikard Wolff), as uninibited as she is stunning, 
descends upon them. She is the granddaughter the village people never knew 
their recently deceased local squire (Per Oscarsson) had. Not only do she and 
her colorful friends shock and titillate the community, but a prosperous local 
farmer (Sven Wollter) becomes determined to acquire Oscarsson' estate -- no 
matter what it takes. Fun and full of surprises. (Cinemax, Wednesday at 8 p.m.)

 This 1993 release is just as hilarious as the 1992 original, which was one of 
the most distinctive American comedies in years. Mike Myers and Dana Carvey 
(left) return as those two Aurora, Ill., youths who host a goofy late-night 
cable-access TV show.They're a couple of small-town guys who like to think of 
themselves as being incredibly hip yet possess considerable naivete. A year has 
passed since Myers' cocky Wayne and Carvey's somewhat dim Garth have resisted 
selling out their show for big bucks, and they're at loose ends when Wayne hits 
upon staging a huge concert -- "Waynestock." Along with such bands as 
Aerosmith, Pearl Jam and Van Halen, Wayne wants his gorgeous girlfriend (Tia 
Carrere) to appear, but a suave record producer (Christopher Walken) wants to 
whisk her out to the West Coast for reasons Wayne suspects are not entirely 
professional. With a hilarious turn by Kim Basinger (pictured) as Garth's date 
(HBO, Saturday at 8 p.m.). Kevin Thomas

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; JULIANNA MARGULIES, HEAD NURSE ON 'ER,' ENJOYS THE 
TREATMENT SHE'S GETTING 
</P>

 Julianna Margulies thought she was dead. The actress in her, at least, was 
convinced that her "ER" character -- head nurse Carol Hathaway -- had met her 
Grim Reaper when the hospital drama's well-received pilot wrote Hathaway into a 
coma after a suicide attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Margulies thought her role on the series was over. "I had no idea I was coming 
back," she says from her Santa Monica apartment. "I was hired as a guest star, 
just for the pilot." Margulies already had returned to Baltimore to resume work 
for her recurring role on NBC's "Homicide: Life on the Street" when she got 
word that she was made an "ER" regular. 
</P>
<P>
 Hathaway's suicide attempt has yet to be fully explained. "(Ex-lover) Ross 
(George Clooney) thinks it's his fault, but it's much more complicated. It'll 
be a slow process in revealing what really happened," Margulies says. "It's 
depressing enough being in the ER, and it's pretty dark to be talking about 
suicide. Eventually things will come out." 
</P>
<P>
 After the second episode aired -- and it was revealed that Hathaway did 
survive -- Margulies attended a nurses convention in San Antonio, Tex. "I'd 
heard nurses were angry and protesting her suicide attempt, so I wanted to talk 
to them while we attended classes and researched." 
</P>
<P>
 The nurses told Margulies "that nurses were so badly represented on television 
and in the entertainment industry, that to finally see a nurse who was so 
strong and had it together and then see her commit suicide, didn't make them 
happy." 
</P>
<P>
 But further research proved her character's actions authentic. "They thought 
she was a drug addict, because you see her getting into the drug cabinet," 
Margulies says. "That's what I thought, too. We had two chaperon nurses and 
both of them shared experiences with drug abuse." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the nurses came to the conclusion that, while they didn't know if 
suicide was common, drug problems due to stress were quite common among members 
of their profession. 
</P>
<P>
 The show's authenticity is further guaranteed, Margulies says, because there 
are always professionals on the grueling work set. "When you see us in a trauma 
situation or an operating scene, the people other than the main cast are real 
doctors and nurses." 
</P>
<P>
 She's particularly proud of Hathaway, even though at first she worried that, 
at 26, she was too young to be a head nurse. "I asked them about it, and they 
said, 'No, that's the way it is, you have to be young and strong to deal with 
all the stresses.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Hathaway, Margulies observes, "is strong and controlling and that's why she's 
good at her job. She has a dry sense of humor and a very dark side to her that 
she doesn't wear on her sleeve. She's very compassionate, even if she's dealing 
with her own demons." 
</P>
<P>
 Things may be looking up for the head nurse's social life. She'll get a ring, 
but Margulies won't say from whom. 
</P>
<P>
 The East Coast native, who says she's as willful as Hathaway but much softer, 
won her first role in 1991 opposite Steven Seagal in "Out For Justice." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was difficult getting work," she says. "A lot of people told me I'd never 
ever work in TV because my looks were so different. They couldn't tell if I was 
black, Hispanic or what." (She's Romanian-Hungarian-Austrian-Russian, she 
says.) 
</P>
<P>
 Jobs in theater, commercials and series guest shots piled up until she got the 
part of "Homicide's" waitress-turned-violinist. 
</P>
<P>
 Margulies says that on "ER" -- which swiftly beat its one-on-one competitor, 
CBS' "Chicago Hope" before the latter hospital series was moved to another time 
slot -- "the characters are recognizable as human beings. On 'Chicago Hope' 
they seem a little more untouchable. They are so heroic, and I think it's 
difficult to identify with those perfect people. The characters in 'ER' seem 
real. You can identify with them." 
</P>
<P>
 "ER" airs Thursdays at 10 p.m. on NBC.

FOCUS; A SENSE OF DIRECTION; TIM MATHESON HAS ACTED, HE'S PRODUCED AND NOW HE 
WANTS TO ... YES, YOU GUESSED IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It sounds like a Hollywood cliche when you say it, but Tim Matheson has always 
wanted to direct. 
</P>
<P>
 The former child actor (he was the voice of "Jonny Quest") who made the 
transition to leading-man status after 1978's "National Lampoon's Animal 
House," has now made the jump to director's chair. 
</P>
<P>
 Matheson, 46, has directed his first movie, the suspense-thriller 'Breach of 
Conduct," premiering Thursday on cable's USA Network. 
</P>
<P>
 The personable actor feels performers' urges to direct are just a "natural 
extension" of their craft. Still, he says, "all actors think it's easy. It's 
because all they think is that you tell the actors what to do and put the 
camera there. They don't know about the myriad of other things you get involved 
in." 
</P>
<P>
 And Matheson, who is also the co-executive producer, was involved in every 
aspect of the production, "from the length of a hallway, to every member of the 
crew that's hired, to every color that is on the set and every piece of 
wardrobe." 
</P>
<P>
 This afternoon, Matheson is working closely with an editor in a tiny, 
cluttered editing room off of Coldwater Canyon Boulevard in Studio City. 
Matheson and the editor are piecing together a pivotal, suspenseful sequence 
between stars Peter Coyote and Courtney Thorne-Smith ("Melrose Place"). 
</P>
<P>
 Matheson surrounded himself with key production people whom he'd worked with 
before as an actor. "The cinematographer, the production designer, the makeup 
person -- I tried to get as many familiar faces that I could," he says. "People 
that I know who would go an extra mile. I can see after awhile why people, like 
Clint Eastwood, use the same people all the time, because they deliver for 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 "Breach of Conduct," which was written by David Chisholm from a script by 
Scott Abbott, deals with a power-mad colonel (Coyote) of a remote Army base who 
stalks the pretty wife (Thorne-Smith) of a newly arrived officer. He threatens 
her with the destruction of her husband's already less-than-stellar career 
unless she becomes his mistress. She's arrested by military police and declared 
insane after trying to escape from the base. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to make a typical TV movie," says Matheson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oftentimes you look at (the movies) and say, 'Haven't I see this before?' I 
didn't want it to be one of those. I wanted to make it a little different." 
</P>
<P>
 "Breach of Conduct" isn't the first time Matheson has stepped behind the 
camera. He directed an episode of "St. Elsewhere" in the '80s. The experience 
was less than satisfying. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just get beat up," he says, continuing the conversation in the courtyard. 
"You can't really be creative. There isn't time. You don't really direct the 
actors. They have been there a lot longer than you have and they are not going 
to do anything different. It isn't fun. That isn't what what I wanted to do." 
</P>
<P>
 So he tried his hand at producing. 
</P>
<P>
 'That's no fun because you just get all the abuse," says Matheson, who was 
co-producer of the 1990 feature "Blind Fury." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd have a project that I developed and bought the rights to and then all of 
a sudden, the director comes in and the director has all the fun with all the 
actors. It becomes his picture." 
</P>
<P>
 He discovered the script of "Breach of Contract," which was made for 
approximately $2.6 million, through his agent. "I said to him, 'Give me young 
writers.' This script was especially good because it was a genre film." 
</P>
<P>
 Matheson is a real buff of horror films and thrillers. "I love Sam Raimi," he 
says with real enthusiasm. " 'Evil Dead 2' is one of my favorite films. It's 
one of the best, cheaper horror films I've ever seen. Horror films and suspense 
films can be made on a low budget without big stars and be very effective." 
</P>
<P>
 The most difficult aspect of directing was the quick schedule. "I foolishly 
felt I could do this in 18 days," he confesses. "I've even toyed with the idea 
of doing some syndicated action shows. I've sort of been invited to do one or 
two, just to be able to figure out how they do it -- how they shoot 12 pages a 
day. That's one thing I'm learning how to do. I didn't know quite how to do it 
when I started." 
</P>
<P>
 Matheson takes a bite out of his deli sandwich. "I could complain and bitch 
and moan about the problems," he says. "But it's a real thrill to do it. I 
would do it again in a second." 
</P>
<P>
 And he'd love to work with his stars again. "Peter was our first choice," he 
says. "He's one of those guys who are world-class and can do anything. He's 
like driving a Ferrari. He totally gave himself to me. Courtney was very good." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't look for Matheson in a cameo appearance in "Breach of Conduct." "I just 
wanted to stay away," he says. As a director, he explains, "you don't have to 
worry about how you look. You don't have to take care of your clothes. I never 
did sleep that much. I would wake up at 3 a.m. and say, 'Ugh, did I miss a 
shot?' I didn't want to put myself through (acting). I couldn't devote my 
energies." 
</P>
<P>
 Matheson, though, hasn't given up on acting yet. On Dec. 5, he plays a child 
molester in the NBC movie "While Justice Sleeps," which also stars Cybill 
Shepherd. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did this to just open a second front," he says. "Now I've done it and can 
take it out and show it to other people. If it's good enough, (they'll say), 
'OK. We will let you direct if you can come up with a project.' So now I can 
look for feature projects." 
</P>
<P>
 "Breach of Conduct" airs Thursday at 9 p.m. on USA; it repeats Dec. 4 at 8 p.m 
and Dec. 10 at 4 p.m.

PROFILE; ANN-MARGRET FOLLOWS HER INSTINCTS WITH 'HEART' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ann-Margret doesn't like to repeat herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't like to do something I have done before," explains the five-time 
Golden Globe Award winner and former Oscar and Emmy nominee. "I'm instinctive 
and (a script) has to just grab me emotionally." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past three decades, Ann-Margret, 53, has become one of the most 
versatile actresses in film and TV. She's portrayed such diverse characters as 
a sweet teen-ager in 1963's "Bye Bye Birdie," a terminally ill mother in the 
1983 TV movie "Who Will Love My Children?," the fragile Southern belle Blanche 
DuBois in the 1984 TV remake of "A Streetcar Named Desire," and a plantation 
matriarch in the 1993 CBS miniseries "Queen." Two weeks ago, viewers watching 
the CBS miniseries "Scarlett" saw Ann-Margret as the glamorous Belle Watling, 
the madame and confidante of Rhett Butler. 
</P>
<P>
 Her latest film, "Following Her Heart," premiering Monday on NBC, finds her as 
a lonely, plain-Jane widow on a journey of self-discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 On this rainy afternoon, Ann-Margret is relaxing on the floral couch in the 
living room of her impressive Benedict Canyon home, which she shares with her 
husband and co-manager of 27 years, Roger Smith. Also residing in the house are 
a 14-year-old Maltese named Sugar and a cat named Birdie. Ann-Margret is 
friendly and chatty, especially about the NBC movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Following Her Heart" finds her playing Ingalill, a Swedish woman who has been 
trapped in a loveless, arranged marriage for more than 30 years. She was just a 
teen-ager when she married her older, stern husband Anders (Morgan Sheppard). 
The couple moved from Sweden to North Dakota. Anders spends most of his time 
lavishing attention on his pet parakeet while he keeps a tight rein on 
Ingalill. The only bright light in their marriage is their daughter Nola 
(Alexandra Powers), who is married to a womanizer. 
</P>
<P>
 When Anders dies of a heart attack, Ingalill, who teaches piano and sings, 
decides to take a bus tour to Nashville so she can finally meet her longtime 
pen pal with whom she has been writing songs. While on the tour she quite 
literally lets down her hair and falls in love with a kind widower (George 
Segal). 
</P>
<P>
 "Following Her Heart" was directed by Oscar-winning actress-director Lee 
Grant, someone Ann-Margret has long wanted to work with. "I met Lee seven or 
eight years ago," Ann-Margret recalls. "She wanted me to do this thing I 
couldn't do because I was doing something similar; I have always wanted to work 
with her. And this thing came up. I thought it would be a good project." 
</P>
<P>
 For many reasons. "First of all, it is a Cinderella story," she says with a 
smile. 'But it's every woman's story. The writer (Merry Helm), I don't now if 
you know this, is not a Hollywood person. She lives in North Dakota. It is her 
first screenplay. I really liked the script. I thought it was real charming. 
It's a fairy tale." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Ann-Margret, Helm wrote it with her in mind. But Helm got 
Ann-Margret's native country wrong. "She thought I was Norwegian," says 
Ann-Margret, who was born Ann-Margret Olsson in Valsjobyn, Sweden. Ann-Margret 
and her parents, Gustav and Anna, came to America in the late '40s. "All the 
names (in the script) were Norwegian. I said, 'If I do this, we will have to 
change all the names.' So they did that." 
</P>
<P>
 Her mother also was very involved in the project. "I am always joking that my 
mom should get screen credit for this because she coached the gentleman who 
played my husband, Morgan Sheppard, in his Swedish accent. She has a very 
strong Swedish accent, and, of course, I have lived with that accent all my 
life. So this is really the first time I have ever done a version of her accent 
in a film." 
</P>
<P>
 "Following Her Heart" doesn't fit into today's usual TV movie fare -- it is 
not culled from the headlines and Ingalill is not the typical woman in 
jeopardy. "It is just very moving," she says. "The whole family can see this. I 
know a lot of people in the big cities can be cynical. But I think they can 
really breathe a sigh of relief if they see this. It is uplifting." 
</P>
<P>
 And the message, she says, is a good one. "It doesn't matter how old you are, 
you can do something for the first time." 
</P>
<P>
 When Ingalill, who is nicknamed Lena by her vacation tour mates, leaves North 
Dakota, it is the first time she's "ever had her hair down," says Ann-Margret. 
"The first time she's ever gone in a restaurant. The first time she has ever 
really been in love. The first time she has ever had makeup on. Everything is 
'no' to her. 'No, I can't do this. No, I can't do that,' because that's the way 
it has been all of her life. Now, everything is open to her. She has never sung 
before people before. She never really had anything to drink before." 
</P>
<P>
 Ann-Margret laughs.. "One of my favorite things is when she is a little 
(tipsy), she says, 'Slow gin fuzz.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Following Her Heart" also marks the first time Ann-Margret has sung in a TV 
movie (who can forget her sing-alongs with Elvis on the big screen?) And she 
plays the guitar here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roger was teaching me how to play the guitar," she says, laughing. "You know 
how a man should never teach his wife how to drive? Remember that? I must say 
he was really sweet about it because he has been playing guitar all of his 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 What Ann-Margret found especially interesting about the project was that the 
film was "about a woman. It was written by a woman, directed by a woman, one of 
the producers was a woman, the production manager was a woman. I thought back 
to when I did 'Pocketful of Miracles' in 1961. There were just four women 
behind the scenes: the hairdresser, the wardrobe girl, the body makeup girl and 
a script girl. And on this, there must have been 40! It was incredible to see. 
We have come a long way." 
</P>
<P>
 "Following Her Heart" airs Monday at 9 p.m. on NBC.

RETRO; REACTIVATING 'ROCKFORD'; JAMES GARNER GETS BACK IN THE P.I. BUSINESS 
WITH MOVIES FOR CBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "This is Jim Rockford. At the tone leave your name and message. I'll get back 
to you."  
</P>
<P>
 "The Rockford Files" have been reopened after 15 years of inactive status. 
</P>
<P>
 Emmy Award-winning James Garner, who starred in the popular 1974-79 NBC 
series, is back as the ex-con Los Angeles private investigator Jim Rockford in 
"The Rockford Files: I Still Love L.A.," airing Sunday on CBS. Garner also is 
set to star in five more "Rockford Files" movies over the next two years. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as Garner loved the original series, he says, "There was a lot of 
agony attached to it because it damn near killed me physically. It was very 
difficult. The camera follows me pretty much wherever I go, which means I am in 
every shot in the series. That's a lot, plus 10 pages of dialogue a day." 
</P>
<P>
 And, he adds, "there was all that trouble with the lawsuit," referring to his 
long-running feud with the series' owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years ago, Garner settled an eight-year battle with Universal Television 
over his 37.5% share of the profits from "Rockford." In 1981, the actor sued 
Universal for $16.5 million plus punitive damages, claiming that Universal's 
"shady" accounting procedures had robbed him of millions of dollars. (Universal 
refused comment). Before the undisclosed settlement, Universal accountants 
determined that despite taking in more than $120 million in revenues from 
syndication, foreign and other sales, the series had earned less than $1 
million in profits and Garner's share amounted to $249,313. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Garner agreed to do "Rockford," wild horses can't drag him to shoot the 
movies on the Universal lot. "I just can't do that," he says, during a break in 
the filming at a warehouse-turned-police station in Downtown Los Angeles. "I 
will do 'Rockford,' but I will not go on the lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Garner isn't the only "Rockford" regular back for this week's movie. Joe 
Santos, who played Det. Dennis Becker, still has a love-hate relationship with 
his P.I. pal. And Stuart Margolin, who played Rockford's former prison buddy, 
Angel Martin, is up to his usual shenanigans. 
</P>
<P>
 This "I Still Love L.A." TV film, Garner says, brings Rockford "up to date. 
It's about Los Angeles and everything that has happened here over the past 
three years. We had riots, fires and earthquakes. That's the background of the 
story. I have a new trailer and a different car. I have my old car, but it is 
in pretty bad shape. I have been married and divorced." 
</P>
<P>
 He's also been hired by his ex-wife, prominent defense attorney Halley (Kit) 
Kittredge (Joanna Cassidy) to investigate the murder of an aging film star. 
</P>
<P>
 One regular from the old series who won't be in the movie is Noah Beery Jr., 
who played Rockford's folksy dad, Rocky. Beery died earlier this month at age 
81. "We miss him a lot," Garner says softly. 
</P>
<P>
 Garner also is executive producer of the new "Rockford" movies. " 'Rockford' 
had been offered to me for the last two years," he explains. "I was busy doing 
this and that and then it came up again and I said, 'Well, if I am ever going 
to do it, now is the time to do it. I am going to get too old.' So I just 
decided to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 He also asked Stephen J. Cannell (the show's co-creator) and former 
producer-writers Juanita Bartlett and David Chase to come on board. "I said, 
'Folks, do you want to do some 'Rockfords'? Each one of them will write two a 
piece. So I have got the original writers and creators. We had a production 
meeting one day and there were 22 people from the old show working on it. It 
was like we just went to work again and nothing had happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Santos felt the same way. It took all of "five minutes" to get back into 
character, Santos says. 
</P>
<P>
 And even less to click with Garner. "I have had the opportunity to work with a 
lot of terrific actors," Santos says. "He's probably, I think, one of the top 
six actors not only in this country, but the world. Most actors don't have a 
good sense of humor. Jimmy always had that." 
</P>
<P>
 Playing Angel again has "been delightful," says Margolin, who has been 
concentrating on directing. "I was rather anxious, maybe even scared, because I 
haven't been acting a lot. But so far it has been really fun. Everybody seems 
to be responding very well." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rockford Files: I Still Love L.A." airs Sunday at 9 p.m. on CBS; repeats 
of "The Rockford Files" air weekdays at 10 a.m. and 4 p.m. on A&E.

<P>
 "Hills that had been pounded into bare rubble by artillery have all grown 
back," said Halvorson, a retired wildlife biologist from Ft. Collins, Colo. He 
manned a machine gun during the three-year Korean War, which ended in 1953. Now 
he returns to count birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, rare cranes, egrets and golden eagles are among the creatures that 
swoop and whirl over former killing fields along the demilitarized zone 
separating North and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 The DMZ, lined on either side with enough weapons to kill every person on this 
divided peninsula, has become an unintended wilderness refuge, teeming with 
furred and feathered creatures. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fate of the zone's abundant wildlife, which includes white storks, 
bears, deer, pheasants, ducks, wildcats and possibly even tigers, hangs 
precariously on the continuing debate over North Korea's reported nuclear 
weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
 A renewal of fighting would wipe out this ironic island of life in a potential 
sea of death. But the opposite extreme -- peaceful reunification of the North 
and South -- could prove almost equally disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because the Ch'orwon basin is one of the few relatively flat areas along the 
DMZ, people are already talking about developing it as a sort of a model 
reunification city as soon as the North and South start getting along better," 
said another bird counter and wildlife biologist, Fran Kaliher of Two Harbors, 
Minn. "But at the moment, at least, it's just this little paradise for 
wildlife." 
</P>
<P>
 Halvorson and Kaliher are among a small group of Americans who not only hope 
this natural paradise won't be lost, but who see it as a possible model for 
preserving similar Cold War borders throughout Europe and Asia as wilderness 
corridors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole former Soviet Union and China are ringed with borders that in many 
cases have held back development and are de facto wildlife refuges," said David 
Thompson of the International Crane Foundation in Baraboo, Wis. "It may sound a 
little bit like a crazy idea now, but 50 years from now it might be seen as 
having been visionary." 
</P>
<P>
 The zone was created in July, 1953, as part of the agreement that ended 
fighting between North Korea and the U.S.-led United Nations forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The DMZ is a perfect bedroom for animals: It has no human residents except for 
a few around Panmunjom, site of truce talks, and heavily armed soldiers in 
scattered guard posts. 
</P>
<P>
 Food for the wildlife is readily available within both the DMZ and the 
civilian control zone, the strip where South Korean authorities allow rice 
farming along the DMZ's southern border. 
</P>
<P>
 This arrangement is especially good for wintering cranes. By day they feast on 
leftover grain. At night they retire into the sanctuary of the DMZ and its rich 
network of streams and rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the two most notable animals known to be in the area are red-crowned 
cranes and white-naped cranes, both endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 A 963-square-mile area in the Ch'orwon Valley serves as the winter home for 
almost 300 red-crowneds and 350 white-napeds. An additional 2,000 white-napeds 
stop over for several weeks each year during their spring migration from Japan 
to Russia and northeastern China. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the DMZ were wiped out this year by war, the cranes would eventually find 
their way to China," said Kaliher. "But none of the situations in China are as 
good as this one at the moment -- an area that is totally off-bounds to 
civilians."

OVERFISHING DEVASTATES BRAZIL WATERS; ENVIRONMENT: SPECIES APPROACH EXTINCTION 
AS TRAWLERS ARMED WITH GILL NETS SCOOP UP SCHOOLS OF FISH. UP TO 60% OF THEIR 
CATCH IS LOST TO SPOILAGE. SUBSISTENCE FISHERMEN ARE LOSING THEIR WAY OF LIFE. 
</P>

<P>
 His skiff rocking in rolling blue hills of water, Joao Batista Rodrigues reels 
in one of his fishing lines and hoists a gray, thorny skate into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 The grin on his wind-cracked lips melts into a scowl. With a grunt, he unhooks 
the ugly little fish and flings it back into the waves. 
</P>
<P>
 Trash fish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hell, I used to pull in stingray, snook, even small sharks," he mutters. "Now 
the big boats come with their nets and take everything but baby fish." 
</P>
<P>
 Overfishing by trawlers and high-tech speedboats has depleted the fabled 
fishing grounds near this jungle port and pushed a number of species in the 
Amazon Basin toward extinction. 
</P>
<P>
 Fishermen who routinely filled sailboats with fish in a few hours now return 
to port in nearly empty vessels. 
</P>
<P>
 And the people of this sleepy equatorial city -- weaned on a traditional diet 
of shrimp, tuna, snapper and Amazon turtle -- are reeling from the higher 
prices and diminishing variety of fresh fish. 
</P>
<P>
 "The waters around here are dying," said Joao Vargas de Conceicao, 45, vice 
president of the local fisherman's union. "I'm telling the boys to look for 
work inland. Fishing is coming to an end here." 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the Portuguese arrived in Guajara Bay on Jan. 12, 1616, and built a 
fortress here at the mouth of the Amazon River, fishing has been the backbone 
of Belem's economy and the frame of its regional identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Generations grew up sprinkling lime juice and salt on flame-broiled tambaqui 
and piramutaba, sweet fish with leathery skin that reach 7 feet in length in 
the cool, silt-brown waters of the Amazon. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the shade of spreading mango trees, locals have long gathered at noon to 
slurp "tacaca," a thick soup of tapioca, manioc juice, pepper, garlic and 
shrimp served with a blue "jambo" leaf in a wooden bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mariscuadores," the subsistence fishermen who live along the Amazon's 
tributaries, brought to market the "peixe-boi" -- manatee -- whose flesh tastes 
like ham and keeps for years with simple preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Mercado Ver o Peso down at the docks, stalls were always filled with 
dozens of species from shrimp, lobster, bonito, and turtle to Amazon fish such 
as enchova, pirarucu or tucunare. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a serious problem of overfishing, especially by shrimp and lobster 
boats," said Ronaldo Barthem, a marine specialist at the government's Emilio 
Goeldi Institute in Belem. 
</P>
<P>
 Shrinking shrimp catches are a sign of impending disaster. Trawlers off the 
Para state coast scooped up 5,000 tons of shrimp last year, 1,000 tons fewer 
than in 1989. And the catch is expected to decline further, Barthem said. 
</P>
<P>
 Small-boat fishermen blame power launches that trawl the high seas. These 
350-foot vessels zigzag through fishing grounds on autopilot while crews track 
schools of fish on sonar screens. 
</P>
<P>
 Using joystick levers, trawler crews guide nets 180 feet wide and 90 feet long 
with 1.2-inch holes into the heart of schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a video game you can't lose," said Rodrigues, a sun-wrinkled man of 
38 who has fished up and down Brazil's northern coast since he was 18. "Nothing 
escapes the nets." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Conceicao, the fishermen's union vice president who gave up fishing on 
his own boat and took work on a trawler 12 years ago, questions the launches' 
"pirate" tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's true, the trawlers sweep up tons of fish they don't want, then throw 
them overboard, dead and rotten," he said. "I've seen ocean turtles, 30- and 
40-pounders, get strangled in the nets. It's nasty." 
</P>
<P>
 Things aren't any better in the Amazon Basin, where the U.S. National Academy 
of Sciences estimates a typical four-mile stretch of waterway may contain up to 
60 species. 
</P>
<P>
 High-tech fish finders lead motorboats unerringly to their prey. With their 
gill nets, the modern fishermen catch five times as many fish as the 
traditional mariscuadores can with their canoes. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble is that between 50% and 60% of the gill-net catch is usually lost. 
A fish caught in the net dies in 20 minutes and spoils in half an hour because 
of the high water temperature, or is devoured by piranhas. 
</P>
<P>
 One victim is the manatee, an aquatic relative of the elephant that propels 
its 2-ton body with a flick of its fantail. 
</P>
<P>
 Mariscuadores say they used to bring in five a night. Today, it's hard to find 
one outside the Belem zoo. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is not only the loss of unique marine life," said Barthem of the 
Goeldi Institute. "Amazon trees rely on fish to distribute their seeds when the 
rivers flood. Without the fish, the forest will lose a key pollinator and its 
ability to regenerate itself can be greatly diminished." 
</P>
<P>
 But what really upsets local residents are the changes at the marketplace. No 
longer is shopping for a seafood lunch or snack a simple task. 
</P>
<P>
 At Trevu's Restaurant in the old city a few blocks from the wharf, the only 
fish on the menu is gilthead. The others -- tambaqui, tucunare, lobster, shrimp 
-- are all crossed out in pencil. 
</P>
<P>
 Alberto Gomes, 62, a hearty man with gel-slicked hair and a barrel belly 
covered by an apron, has been selling fish at the Ver o Peso Market since 1944. 
He shucked a foot-long piramutaba and wrapped it for a customer in a huge, 
green guaruma leaf. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tambaqui? Are you kidding?" he said. "Haven't seen it for two years. We used 
to sell 3-kilo (7-pound) piramutaba, but they keep getting smaller and smaller. 
Now all we got are these half-kilo (1.1-pound) ones. No one's giving 'em time 
to grow. It's a real crime." 
</P>
<P>
 To restore shrimp, snook, lobster and other fish populations, Brazil's federal 
environmental protection agency is studying a ban on trawler activity six 
months each year and moratoriums on fishing permits. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with tougher laws, Arnaldo Bittencourt Costa, a fisherman of 48 with 
tawny hair lightened by 30 years of sailing the South Atlantic, thinks it will 
take 10 years or more for the fish to recover. 
</P>
<P>
 It's 1 p.m., low tide at the docks, and his 36-horsepower sailboat, Blackie, 
is stranded in the mud. Most of Costa's men have strung up their hammocks to 
posts. Their rum bottles lie empty and they are snoozing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blackie returned that morning after 18 days at sea. The catch wasn't good. 
A ton and a half of fish. In the old days, Costa and his eight men used to come 
to port with five times that amount. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't keep this up," Costa says. "We can't get near the good grounds any 
more. Even if you go at night, you run the risk of getting plowed by a 
trawler."

'RED BARON' RATED BURNED OUT AT THE END; 'ACE OF ACES': NEW BIOGRAPHY TRACES 
THE EXPLOITS OF MANFRED VON RICHTHOFEN. BRITISH AND FRENCH CASUALTY REPORTS 
MATCHED CLAIMS OF AERIAL VICTORIES, WRITER SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STRAT DOUTHAT, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Manfred von Richthofen has been dead since 1918, but the famed Red Baron is 
still flying high in the imaginations of comic strip creator Charles M. Schulz 
and New Britain writer Peter Kilduff. 
</P>
<P>
 In his Peanuts comic strip Schulz frequently has Snoopy assume the persona of 
a World War I aviator -- complete with scarf, leather cap and goggles. The 
ubiquitous beagle is always bested by the Red Baron, the German ace. 
</P>
<P>
 Snoopy's wartime encounters are not always appreciated in academic circles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some historians call it 'the Snoopification' of the Red Baron," said Kilduff. 
"But, personally, I think Schulz has done a pretty good job of inserting 
aviation history into his comic strip." 
</P>
<P>
 And Kilduff should know, given that he has written a detailed history of 
aerial warfare during World War I, and two books about Von Richthofen. In 
addition, he says he has read everything he can find about the man, both in 
English and German. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been intensely interested in Manfred von Richthofen, and his era, since 
I was a teen-ager," says the 53-year-old Central Connecticut State University 
administrator. "I've done extensive research on his life, even to the point of 
procuring the weekly reports of his wartime activities from the German military 
archives in Munich and Potsdam. Some of the material hadn't been seen in the 
West for more than 50 years." 
</P>
<P>
 In his 1969 book, "The Red Baron," Kilduff translated Von Richthofen's memoirs 
into English. In "Beyond The Legend of the Red Baron," which came out in this 
country several weeks ago, Kilduff says he thinks he has written the definitive 
biography of the World War I "ace of aces," who shot down 80 Allied airplanes 
before being killed in France at age 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilduff says archival material obtained several years ago from East Germany 
gave him the chance to match German aerial victory claims with British and 
French casualty reports. Not only has he been able to document the Red Baron's 
military career, but he says his book is the only unbiased account of Von 
Richthofen's life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I warned my British publisher -- Arms and Armour Press of London -- that this 
book will make nobody happy," he said. "In Germany, Von Richthofen is the 'hero 
of heroes.' In England he is 'the bloody Hun.' What I've tried to do is write a 
biography that cuts right down the middle, that separates fact from myth." 
</P>
<P>
 Kilduff says his research shows that Von Richthofen, who was killed shortly 
after shooting down his 80th plane, was a likable, principled man but was in 
very shaky health at the end, both mentally and physically. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was at the peak of his military career, but he also was emotionally tired 
and deeply depressed, and was suffering severe headaches from injuries he 
received in a previous crash," Kilduff said. "In effect, he was burned out." 
</P>
<P>
 On the day he was killed, Kilduff says, the Red Baron's all-red Fokker 
triplane was shot down in the Somme River valley after Von Richthofen violated 
one of his own cardinal rules -- never fly too low in enemy territory. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was practically at eye level with a group of Australian ground troops, in 
pursuit of a Sopwith Camel flown by a Canadian pilot," Kilduff said. "It was 
Sunday, April 21, 1918. It's not clear whether he was killed by a pursuing 
aircraft or by a bullet from one of the troops on the ground. It's a continuing 
controversy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Baron's plane crash-landed and he was pulled from the wreckage, 
already dead. The German ace was buried on the battlefield but later was 
exhumed and taken to Germany, where he was given a hero's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's still larger than life in Germany," said Kilduff, who noted that his 
book contains more than a dozen battlefield photographs and a full-text 
translation of the Red Baron's air combat operations manual. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, he recommended getting behind your enemy and closing in on him 
before opening fire," he said. "It's still good advice, even in the jet age. I 
had a recent call from an F-16 fighter pilot who said these techniques are 
still being taught to new pilots."

COUPLE WORK MIRACLES, SAVE ABANDONED DOGS; RESCUE: UTAH COUPLE HAS FOUND HOMES 
FOR 1,800 SICK, BLIND AND OLD GOLDEN RETRIEVERS SINCE PROGRAM STARTED SIX YEARS 
AGO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Every so often, Bill and Mickie Britton get a card in the mail with a little 
pocket change taped to the back. The cards are from a blind girl trying to say 
thanks for a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brittons say their lives -- and backyard -- are full of such wonders. The 
only problem is cleaning up after them. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brittons run the Companion Golden Retriever Rescue Program, a nonprofit 
business operating on a shoestring and lots of good will with only one goal: 
finding homes for abandoned dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dogs are very big medicine," said Britton, a 64-year-old retired government 
worker and disabled veteran, a dog at either hand. "The therapy of having a dog 
in your life is just out of this world." 
</P>
<P>
 Britton has found homes for sick dogs, blind dogs and old dogs -- 1,800 in 
all, and not just retrievers, since the rescue program was started in his home 
six years ago. He can prove it, too -- half a dozen photo albums stuffed with 
Polaroids of his canine charges crowd a corner of the mantel. 
</P>
<P>
 A medical bill collection manager during the day, Mickie Britton spends her 
nights arranging for dogs or making pickups. Friends consider her the backbone 
of the organization, while Bill is seen as an idea-a-minute man with a knack 
for getting things done. 
</P>
<P>
 Witness the 2,000 tennis balls (something for the retrievers to, well, 
retrieve) donated by Pepsi Cola, or the hundreds of old Primary Children's 
hospital blankets lining the four kennels in the basement. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill long ago gave up trying to grow a lawn. His backyard is covered with hay 
-- donated, of course -- to make daily cleanup a little easier. Dog runs were 
donated. Ditto the truck in the driveway. 
</P>
<P>
 The $2,500 needed to register as a nonprofit corporation? Provided by a local 
gynecologist and golden retriever owner. And Bill skirted ordinances requiring 
a kennel license by finagling a noncompliance permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Every day, he said, the mail brings a letter "from one of my dogs," and a 
check or two. Dog food is bought below wholesale, and vets give them discount 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Britton is a walking conundrum with a gruff, Texas drawl. A combat soldier in 
World War II and Korea, he's seen people do horrible things to one another. So 
he's placed his faith in canines. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's people I'd like to kill 'cause of their cruelty to animals. But a dog 
loves you whether you've got money in the bank or not," he said, his eyes 
misting. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you had no home and had to sleep in the gully, that dog would lie down 
beside you and be just as happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Britton has no shortage of stories of man's inhumanity to beast. But he also 
can reel off dozens of tales with happy endings. 
</P>
<P>
 A certified animal behaviorist, he has placed a number of dogs with disabled 
veterans and other handicapped individuals -- including Remington, a companion 
retriever to 32-year-old Barbara DeMent of Kearns. 
</P>
<P>
 DeMent was barely able to get around the house after radical surgery five 
years ago. Often alone, she lost her will to live. 
</P>
<P>
 Her family, in desperation, got her Remington -- an abandoned dog trained by 
Britton -- who helps her negotiate stairs, brings her the phone and answers the 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what I'd do without him," DeMent said. "If I need help getting 
up and down the stairs, I can call him over and he'll let me hold onto his 
collar and pull me up." 
</P>
<P>
 Another dog went to the little blind girl, who was 5 years old when her family 
asked for a dog for her two years ago, Britton said. He gave her an old dog 
that had "outlived its master" because the family could not afford to pay for 
it. Since then, he says, the girl has sent several notes each year, all taped 
with change. 
</P>
<P>
 Any visit with Britton is interrupted by phone calls -- some from people 
looking for dogs, others from area animal shelters. Virtually every shelter in 
Utah -- and dozens in surrounding states -- know whom to call when they've got 
a stray golden, and all of them list him as a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
 Britton readily admits he can't save all the dogs, but his philosophy is 
simple: The ones he does save make a difference in people's lives.

THEY'RE ELDERLY BUT NOT RETIRING; BETTE DAVIS SAID, 'GETTING OLD AIN'T FOR 
SISSIES.' HERE IS THE VIEW FROM A RETIREMENT HOME WHERE OCTOGENARIANS LIVE 
ACTIVE, FULL LIVES.

<P>
 A 5-year-old boy who accompanied his mother to a retirement home is puzzled. 
He can't understand why she calls her friends there "the girls." He says they 
have "grandma faces." 
</P>
<P>
 I never expected to be among them, or the grandpas they greatly outnumber, but 
I have been here now for more than two years. 
</P>
<P>
 I never felt this old until 10 years ago when a young lady in a car next to me 
in a crowded parking lot waved me ahead of her with an "OK Pop." I was then 79 
and took umbrage because I felt no sign of advancing age. A newspaper headline 
on a story I wrote at the time said, "At What Age Does One Become 'Old'?" 
</P>
<P>
 I still recall the remarks of a clergyman, retiring on his 75th birthday, who 
told his parishioners: "You think I'm old. You are old when your mind makes a 
date your body can't keep, and I'm not that old." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, at 90, I find that old age for me began in my 80s. Steps got shorter, 
every chore took longer (most everything these days is a chore -- even 
dressing), visits to doctors and hospitals became more numerous, bones more 
brittle. An afternoon nap is one of life's little pleasures. 
</P>
<P>
 Words do not flow as they once did when I was an active newspaperman (he 
covered the Lindbergh kidnaping trial for the Associated Press and later became 
the AP's general news editor) but when I have to ponder the right word, I find 
solace in E. B. White's lament: 
</P>
<P>
 "The aging mind has a bagful of nasty tricks, one of which is to tuck names 
and words away in crannies where they are not immediately available." 
</P>
<P>
 So, with illness in the family and my having suffered a broken hip, we entered 
a high-rise retirement home here. We liked it and I, now alone, still do. Not 
everyone does. A relative, whom I tried to persuade to join me, said, "No. When 
I go outdoors, I don't want to have to take an elevator." 
</P>
<P>
 There are 348 of us here -- doctors, lawyers, educators, engineers, 
journalists, military veterans (one went to Utah Beach in June for the 50th 
anniversary of D-Day) and many former government employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents are still active. A lawyer in his 90s, who specializes in 
drafting wills, probating estates and consulting on domestic relations, still 
goes to his office daily. Despite a minor leg fracture recently, he was back to 
work in three weeks.

 One resident, a retired Army general, buys and sells stamps. Another is a 
chemical consultant. Wallace J. Campbell, one of the founders in New York City 
of CARE, an organization involved in relief, food programs and development in 
44 countries, goes daily to CARE's Washington office. Once president of the 
organization, he is now president-emeritus. 
</P>
<P>
 Many are volunteer workers at Washington arts and musical centers -- the 
National Gallery, the Smithsonian and Kennedy Center, among others. Some help 
out at the Montgomery County senior education department and the public 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 One lady joins other volunteers in handling White House mail. They code it by 
numbers for an official response. They must have security clearance and sign a 
year's contract and pledge to work 16 hours a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Sinatra is here. Not "Mr. Blue Eyes from Hoboken," but "Mr. Brown Eyes 
from Philadelphia." Our Mr. Sinatra was a percussionist for 30 years with the 
National Symphony in Washington. In his apartment is a picture of the two 
Franks with Dinah Shore taken years ago in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 We have a lady who likes to be called "Countess." She conducts herself 
sedately, never goes out without hat or gloves, enjoys having tea Sunday 
afternoons in a downtown hotel. One day we got the real story. At tea a young 
waitress heard her addressed by friends as "Countess." 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you a real countess?" she asked. 
</P>
<P>
 The reply: "I was married to a real no-account. I think that makes me a real 
countess." 
</P>
<P>
 Most elderly people love to eat. They are at the dining room door in numbers 
before the 8 a.m. opening for the buffet breakfast. The standing joke: "If you 
want strawberries, you better be here before 8." No sooner finished with 
breakfast, many residents go to the lobby to read the dinner menu. They line up 
early for two evening sittings. A woman once appeared at 3 p.m., said she was 
hungry and asked if she could have dinner. Sorry. 
</P>
<P>
 At dinner one night, a lady talked about her 18-year-old cat that suffers from 
arthritis and deafness, among other problems, but "loves to eat." 
</P>
<P>
 "Just like the people here," her dinner companion commented. 
</P>
<P>
 Many women say they came here because they tired of cooking. "Anything I don't 
have to do -- buy it, cook it and serve it -- is fine with me," one said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another who once felt the same way says she is leaving "because I miss my 
cooking." 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure that few, if any, of us had at home every night a menu like this: 
soupe a l'onion, Caesar salad, fresh rolls, cottage cheese, apple sauce, fruit 
juice, a choice of lamb with mint sauce, chicken Florentine or turbot with 
sauce veloute, lemon sorbet or chocolate mousse and coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's swimming and water-exercise classes. In the latter we wiggle our 
fingers and toes, dance and prance, all of which one lady says "takes us back 
to our childhood." 
</P>
<P>
 The class instructor says she heard some women ask: "Are we ready for Broadway 
or the Rockettes?" 
</P>
<P>
 No need for any worry there.

BOY, VET SHARE GRIEVING AS PET CAT DIES; HEARTBREAK: THE BOY CAME FULL OF 
TRUST, A FAITH IN AUTHORITY. HOW COULD SHE TELL THE YOUNGSTER THAT HIS BELOVED 
COMPANION WAS LIKELY GOING TO DIE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 I am not sure how he got to my clinic. He didn't really look old enough to 
drive, although his child's body had begun to broaden and he moved with the 
heavy grace of young manhood. 
</P>
<P>
 His face was direct and open, and when I walked into the waiting room my first 
view was of him unselfconsciously and lovingly petting his cat through the open 
door of the carrier on his lap. With a schoolchild's faith in authority, he had 
brought his sick cat in for me to fix and sat waiting with patience and 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The cat was about the boy's own age, give or take a year, but she was a tiny 
thing. I could see how her spots and stripes and her fierce, bright face had 
evoked the image of a tiger in a child's mind, and Tigress she had become. 
</P>
<P>
 She was an exquisitely formed cat with a delicate skull and beautiful 
markings. 
</P>
<P>
 I began to ask questions, trying to determine what had brought this charming 
pair to see me, and the boy answered them simply, directly and honestly, unlike 
most adults who dissemble, ramble or tell you everything but the answer to the 
question you actually asked. 
</P>
<P>
 In a matter of minutes I learned that Tigress had had a normal appetite until 
recently, that several days ago she had begun to vomit a couple of times a day, 
and now was not eating at all and had become withdrawn from her human family. 
</P>
<P>
 My mental computer did not come up with anything obvious from this history, so 
I petted and stroked Tigress and told her how beautiful she was while I 
examined her eyes and mouth, listened to her heart and lungs, and palpated her 
abdomen. 
</P>
<P>
 My fingers found it. A tubular mass in her midabdomen. Tigress politely tried 
to slip from my searching fingers. She did not like the mass being handled. She 
had also lost a pound, which is a lot when you only weigh 6 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 I looked at the fresh-faced youngster and back at the cat he had probably had 
all his life. I was going to have to tell him that his most beloved companion 
had a mass, probably a cancer, in her abdomen. Even if her mass were surgically 
resectable, she probably would survive less than a year, and she might need 
weekly chemotherapy to get even that. 
</P>
<P>
 It would all be very difficult and expensive. So I was going to have to tell 
this child that his cat was likely going to die. And there he was, all alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Death is something that is pushed to the background and ignored as long as 
possible, but in reality every single living thing one loves will die. It is an 
omnipresent part of life. How the first death is experienced can be 
life-forming. Death can be an unbearable thing of horror and suffering, or a 
peaceful release. 
</P>
<P>
 I wondered why this child was here alone. I would have to guide him through 
this myself. I was tired from the long morning. I did not want this burden. It 
had to be done perfectly or this child, who was not even mine, might end up 
emotionally scarred. 
</P>
<P>
 It would have been so easy just to leave the room and call a parent and 
discuss this all with them and shirk this onerous task. But when I looked at 
his direct and open face, I could not do it. I had spent too long palpating the 
horror that was eating away at Tigress's life and he knew something was wrong. 
I could not just ignore him and call his parents and have them explain it all 
to him. It would have been cruel. 
</P>
<P>
 So I talked to him as Tigress's rightful owner and told him as gently as I 
could what I had found and what it meant. As I talked he jerked convulsively 
away from me, probably so I could not see his face, but I had seen it begin to 
twist even as he turned. I sat down and turned to Tigress, to give him some 
privacy, and stroked her beautiful old face with my fingers while I discussed 
his alternatives with him. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the same old unchanging options for bad disease -- put her through 
the extensive pre-surgical work-up and then attempt to remove and biopsy the 
mass, let her continue to fade away at home or give her an injection and put 
her to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 He listened carefully and nodded gravely. He said he didn't think she was very 
comfortable anymore and he didn't want her to suffer. He was trying very hard. 
The pair of them broke my heart. I offered to call a parent to explain what was 
going on. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhat relieved, he gave me his father's number in the city. I went over 
everything again with the father while the boy stood and listened and petted 
his cat. Then I let father speak to son. The child paced and gestured and his 
voice broke a few times, but when he had hung up he turned to me again with dry 
eyes and said only that they had decided to put her to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 No rage, no denial, no hysteria, just rational acceptance of the inevitable. I 
could see, though, how much it was costing him. I asked him if he wanted to 
take her home overnight to say goodby. I thought she was stable enough to give 
him this time to get used to the awful news I had given him so suddenly. But he 
just said no, he just wanted to be alone with her for a few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 I left them alone and went to sign out the barbiturate I would use to ease her 
into a painless sleep. I could not control the tears that were streaming down 
my face, or the grief I felt welling up inside of me for this child who had to 
become an adult so quickly and so alone. 
</P>
<P>
 I waited outside the exam room. In a few minutes he came out and simply said 
that he was ready. I asked him if he wanted to stay with her. He looked 
surprised, but I explained that it was often easier to see how peaceful it was 
than to forever wonder how it actually happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately seeing the logic of that, he held her head and reassured her while 
I administered the injection and she drifted off to sleep, her head cradled in 
his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The animal itself always looked quiet and at rest. The owner now bore all the 
suffering. This was the finest gift you could give to something you loved, to 
assume their pain that they might rest. 
</P>
<P>
 He nodded. He understood. Something was missing though. I did not feel like I 
had completed my task. It came to me suddenly that though I had asked him to 
become a man instantly, and he had done so with grace and strength, that in 
essence he was still a child. 
</P>
<P>
 I held out my arms and asked him if he needed a hug. He did indeed, and in 
truth, so did I.

WOMAN FIGHTS FOR NORMAL LIFE; HEALTH: WHILE THE TEST FOR HUNTINGTON'S DISEASE 
HAS ABOUT 98% ACCURACY, SHE REFUSES TO LET ITS POSITIVE DIAGNOSIS DICTATE HER 
LIFE. TO PROVE IT SHE GOT A DOG AND BOUGHT A HOUSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When Susan Caldwell decided to learn if she carried the gene for Huntington's 
disease, she also bought a house and got a dog. 
</P>
<P>
 She named the dog Lucky, not so much to express her optimism over the testing, 
but as a "hope for the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Susan, a 27-year-old software programmer, is one of almost two dozen people 
who have undergone genetic testing at the Georgia Mental Health Institute for 
Huntington's, which causes the deterioration of the brain's neurons and is one 
of the few genetically linked diseases receptive to a predictive test. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the test has about 98% accuracy, she refuses to let her positive 
diagnosis dictate her life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not resigned to it," Susan said. "It's frightening. But I'm very aware 
that a lot of things before then could determine my fate." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, she grabs whatever control she can over her health. She doesn't smoke, 
and she rarely drinks -- "I can't spare the neurons," she jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 But her ultimate act of gaining control was the decision to find out if she 
carried the renegade Huntington's gene, which derails the mental and physical 
functions of its victims -- and previously claimed the lives of her uncle and 
maternal grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan never knew the grandfather, who died of Huntington's at age 54. 
Apparently, the family didn't then understand the implications of the illness. 
It took her uncle's mind and then his life, also at age 54, before Susan's 
mother realized the same disease could strike her family. 
</P>
<P>
 In her early 20s, Susan watched her mother fight what appeared to be symptoms 
of early Huntington's -- the odd, puppet-like movements, the behavioral 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery of a tumor in her mother's brain at first gave Susan a weird 
sense of relief, but a visit after its removal in November, 1991, left her in 
no doubt. Her mother had Huntington's; Susan, too, was at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was struggling with the knowledge that she had the disease, and the 
knowledge of the 50% possibility that I was at risk," she recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 After her mother's official diagnosis in July, 1992, Susan learned of a test 
that could tell her if she were likely to develop Huntington's. She contacted 
genetic counselor Randi Jones at the Georgia Mental Health Institute, but 
couldn't bring herself to follow through. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was 'life and death' for awhile, then I'd have to drop it," she said. "As 
much as I thought I wanted to know, I had to break from it." She would schedule 
appointments with Jones, only to cancel them. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan confronted her own mortality. At first, she considered moving out West 
and living a "no roots" life. She gave up her apartment, packed most of her 
belongings and cut off many of her friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just had this overwhelming fear of missing life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But over a six-month period, something changed. She felt a need to commit to 
the future, to her future. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, 1993, after searching for a new apartment, the self-described 
"nest-builder" bought a townhouse in suburban Atlanta, complete with a 30-year 
mortgage. She planted flowers and grass, taking satisfaction from digging in 
the earth and watching seeds take root. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, she decided she was ready for the testing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to know, no matter what the test results were," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But then came another delay. In March, 1993, researchers announced a 
breakthrough -- they had found the Huntington's gene. A new test -- one that 
could predict with almost certainty -- would be available soon in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan waited another nine months, but the time simply strengthened her 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Before she was allowed to undergo the necessary blood tests in February of 
this year, she had been required to participate in a process called genetic 
counseling, which involves helping patients decide whether they want to be 
tested and then how to cope with the result. 
</P>
<P>
 For Huntington's, it also involves extensive neurological and psychological 
tests, to see if the patient has any symptoms of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Five weeks after giving two blood samples, on March 17, Susan learned her 
results. She "cried some," she says, but felt relief that her worst fear -- an 
inconclusive result -- didn't come true. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the decision to test is right for everyone," she said. "But I 
had to have an answer. I'm a real black-and-white kind of person." 
</P>
<P>
 The deterioration generally starts when the sufferer is in his or her 40s and, 
so far, Susan doesn't have any symptoms. She sometimes worries and suffers 
insomnia, but denies being obsessed. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I do something clumsy, I'll think about it. . . . It'll always be there," 
she says of knowing she has the gene. 
</P>
<P>
 But the waiting is over. Susan doesn't count her days, and she looks forward 
to her future. She now dates, and worries about her yardwork and plants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life is playing with my dog, cutting my grass, talking with my neighbors," 
she said. "I'm really lucky. I wouldn't ask for the experience, but I've been 
fortunate. Life doesn't stop."

CHILDHOOD HOBBY GROWS INTO MOBILE ZOO; NATURALIST: A FASCINATION WITH ANIMALS 
HAS LED DEAN DAVIS TO AMASS SOME UNUSUAL PETS. NOW, THE SELF-TAUGHT ZOOLOGIST 
TAKES THEM ON THE ROAD AND SHARES THEM WITH OTHERS. 
</P>

<P>
 When he was 8, Dean Davis bought a tiny green turtle for a quarter, put it in 
a pan with a plastic palm tree, and fed it dried flies. He flushed it down the 
toilet when it died. 
</P>
<P>
 He got another. But he went to the library to learn how to keep it. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-four years later, the cooter is thriving. So is the crocodile Davis 
bought at Woolworth's when he was 12, an alligator snapper he got when he was 
8, and hundreds of other beasts he has acquired over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, 42, is one of those rare individuals who manage to turn a boyhood hobby 
into a career. 
</P>
<P>
 The self-taught naturalist -- an outspoken man who is given to jibes at 
animal-rights activists and his ex-wife -- spends his days giving ecology talks 
at schools, civic meetings and museums and his nights tending to about 300 
species of creatures. 
</P>
<P>
 His menagerie includes foot-long scorpions, tarantulas, whistling marmots, 
monkeys, macaws, sloths, rattlesnakes, chinchillas, prairie dogs, kinkajous, 
coatimundis, land crabs, cobras, pythons, tree frogs, sail-finned basilisk 
lizards, barking geckos, and a nine-pound, rat-eating Amazon toad. 
</P>
<P>
 Many are cast-offs from zoos, pet shops or people who found an exotic novelty 
too hard to handle. Some were acquired through swaps arranged over computer 
bulletin boards linking zoo traders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll give a home to any animal people don't want," Davis said. 
</P>
<P>
 He tried to open his collection to the public as a zoo eight years ago. But he 
dropped the plan after harassment from animal-rights activists. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some groups who feel animals are better off dead than in a cage," 
said Davis, who is secretive about the location of his animals for fear of a 
break-in. 
</P>
<P>
 Since he can't bring people to see his animals, Davis brings his animals to 
the people. He's booked about 275 days a year, he says, mainly in schools but 
also at museums such as the Museum of Natural History in New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the zoo-mobile," he said while chain-smoking cigarettes and swigging 
caffeine-packed Jolt cola beside his Buick Skylark during a break between shows 
at Glenmont Elementary School, just south of Albany. The car, littered with 
corncobs and Cheerios, has only a driver's seat so that it has room for cages 
and foam reptile boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 At Glenmont, children wearing wildlife T-shirts greet him by his first name; 
Davis has been doing programs there twice a year for four years, he says. 
Teachers plan science and writing projects around the shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis' 40-minute talks are fast-paced, funny and filled with facts. One show 
at Glenmont, on camouflage, included moths that mimic leaves, and a baby 
crocodile with bands that blend in with cattails. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy's caterpillar is the coolest mimic," he said, holding up a 
butterfly. "It looks like bird doo-doo. It works so well that there are 20,000 
kinds of butterflies with bird-dropping caterpillars." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is one of the deadliest snakes in the world," he said, draping a banded 
krait across his bare hands. "His fangs are thinner than an eyelash. He'd only 
bite me if I stepped on him or hurt him, because it would probably break his 
teeth. Nature gave him warning colors: black and yellow stripes." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis was a guest lecturer at the New York State Museum in Albany for five 
years, until his contract was dropped last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't politically correct," Davis said. "Some people say I sound like Rush 
Limbaugh when I talk about animal rights. One line that got me in trouble was 
one I stole from Rush: If dolphins are smarter than people, how come we catch 
them in tuna nets?" 
</P>
<P>
 Although he has been collecting animals since childhood, Davis discourages 
others from doing so unless they can meet an animal's needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Reptiles, especially turtles, take a long time to die," Davis said. "A kid 
might have one live for two years and think that's great. But that animal 
should have lived 45 years. It just died a slow death." 
</P>
<P>
 "This cooter eats a pound of water plants a day, plus worms, goldfish, dead 
mice," Davis said, referring to his 34-year-old dime-store turtle. "People 
starve them. They don't keep them warm enough. They don't provide ultraviolet 
light for basking." 
</P>
<P>
 When someone gives him a new animal, Davis said, he seeks a mate for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only way you can tell if an animal is really healthy is if it 
reproduces," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had some Mexican two-footed worm lizards for 20 years. I've never gotten 
them to breed. I don't know if they're too hot, too cold, if it's some dietary 
deficiency. . . . That drives me berserk." 
</P>
<P>
 "With my two-toed sloths, vitamin E and selenium got them to breed like rats," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He uses the young in shows, and gives some to zoos. Many become food. 
</P>
<P>
 "My 17-foot cobra will swallow a six-foot python like a piece of spaghetti," 
Davis said. "The baby turtles I use as food for cottonmouths and anacondas." 
</P>
<P>
 His vocation has hazards. He has been bitten in the knee and the head by his 
12-foot crocodile. A nine-foot monitor lizard cracked three of his ribs with 
her tail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been bitten by poisonous snakes 43 times," he said. A year ago, he lost 
a finger to gangrene resulting from a bite inflicted when a boy hassled a 
cottonmouth he was handling at a school. 
</P>
<P>
 But Davis takes the pain in stride, with a hint of pride: 
</P>
<P>
 "That cottonmouth was the great-grandchild of the first venomous snake that 
ever bit me, back when I was 12," he said.

SENIORS SHED THEIR GERIATRIC BLUES, EXPLORE RED-HOT MUSICAL HORIZONS; 
RETIREMENT: THEIR 100-MEMBER BAND IS COMPOSED OF PEOPLE AGES 50 AND UP, NEARLY 
ALL RETIRED.

 When his wife of 45 years died in 1990, Charlie Rose was a lost soul. A year 
later, at age 76, his lone journey took an inspirational leap: The retired 
teacher and magistrate bought a saxophone, an instrument he'd yearned to play 
since childhood, and joined a band. 
</P>
<P>
 Geriatric gigs are gettin' down! 
</P>
<P>
 They transport Rose and his new wife -- a widow in the alto sax section -- 
down parade routes, into parks, festivals, retirement homes and onto many a 
splendid concert stage. 
</P>
<P>
 The 100-member New Horizons Band they belong to is composed of people ages 50 
and up, nearly all retired. Many hadn't played musical instruments for half a 
century, if at all, when they came together in January, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "Music, I think, gives people a sense that they have something to contribute," 
said the band's founder and conductor, Roy Ernst. "And I'm not sure that that's 
so common for people as they get older." 
</P>
<P>
 Ernst, 56, thinks beginning bands for seniors will catch on as baby boomers 
slide into retirement. The nation's 65-plus population is expected to double to 
65 million in 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
 A professor of music education at the University of Rochester's Eastman School 
of Music, Ernst helped a similar band get going in Madison, Wis., in 1992. 
Others are starting up this fall in Indianapolis and early next year in Phoenix 
and Iowa City, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially taught by graduate students, the players in Upstate New York 
rehearse twice weekly, working on staples by Hoagy Carmichael, John Philip 
Sousa and Irving Berlin. As they've improved, ensembles have splintered off for 
chamber recitals or for extra hours of jive at dance halls and conventions. 
</P>
<P>
 Although exhilarated by what they've accomplished, few found it easy learning. 
Some struggle to adapt: One woman with severe arthritis plays a curled flute; 
poor eyesight can blur the conductor's instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never felt there was anything I couldn't accomplish, so I went along 
with great confidence, and I almost got defeated," recounted Robert Marsey, 60, 
a businessman turned flutist. "Oh, it was terrible. Terrible! But I stuck with 
it after quitting 26 times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roy said, 'If you can only play one note, sit there and play that one note.' 
I stayed with it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure how good we are -- we're not bad. We'll never be there. It 
doesn't mean we cannot enjoy it and bring pleasure to others, too. People 
should retire to something. This is better than basket weaving." 
</P>
<P>
 "Next to my family, certainly, the musical activity is the most important 
thing in my life," said Roger Christensen, 68, a retired professor of 
microbiology who took up clarinet "because Benny Goodman is a hero." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very gratifying just being in a group," he said. "And once in a while, 
the group gets grooving on something and you're just having a ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Leon Katzen, 76, a trombonist, said he played violin at age 10 "but I didn't 
remember any of the notes. I had other interests -- baseball!" 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the instrument was wrong, or the time of life. Katzen wonders now if he 
might have become a professional musician like his son, who plays for the 
Boston Symphony Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 What he has learned is it's never too late. At first, he said with a chortle, 
"the sounds that came out of the instrument were unbelievably bad. . . . Maybe 
they still are." 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you start, you don't want to be a failure," said Katzen, who still works 
as a lawyer. "It would be more enjoyable if I had more time." 
</P>
<P>
 For most others in the band, time is aplenty. And besides getting a second 
chance to try something that passed them by in their youth, music can freshen 
their sense of identity when their careers comes to a close. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a sense of fulfillment here," Rose said. "You feel, 'Well, maybe I'm 
important again.' I don't want to be in life a day without a challenge. I'd 
like to feel it's something I'll master before the Lord takes me along." 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up on a dairy farm near Geneva, N.Y., Rose figured out how to play 
piano between milking cows. The Depression, and then college, came between his 
ambition to learn the sax. All five of his children play various instruments, 
but he just didn't have the time. For 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, he practices one hour a day. "This was something that got me back 
in with people again," he said. "I can't tell you how much I enjoy it." 
</P>
<P>
 Rose found a new companion in Rita Blum Boyer, whose husband had died in 1985. 
"We had something like six or seven saxophonists," she said, "but I chose to 
sit down next to Charlie and thereby lies a tale." 
</P>
<P>
 They were married a year ago. Both turn 80 later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Using volunteers from the band, the University of Rochester's medical school 
is studying whether music stimulates brain function. 
</P>
<P>
 "Becoming part of something that's really thinking toward the future is really 
healthy," Ernst said. "We adjust to having some kinds of imperfections in the 
group all the time, and that doesn't detract from having a really satisfying 
performance. Most concert-goers don't just want to hear a dazzling display of 
technique or a very complicated composition. They want to hear a person perform 
music and have something that comes from the heart."

BRAIN SURGEON OUT TO LUNCH; SO IS LICENSE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A neurosurgeon's license was suspended after an investigation revealed that he 
left a patient's brain exposed for 25 minutes while he got lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 The state medical board also said Dr. Raymond Sattler forgot the names of 
surgical equipment during an operation, told a nurse to drill holes in a 
patient's head and work on the outer brain even though she was not trained to 
do so, and ordered intravenous fluids to be given to him during a procedure 
because he thought he was going to pass out. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sattler left the brain exposed, no other physician was present to care 
for the patient, the board said.

MARINE ACES TRUE HELL-FOR-LEATHER PILOTS; WORLD WAR II: BETWEEN THEM THEY SHOT 
DOWN MORE THAN 50 JAPANESE PLANES. BUT THEIR PROWESS IN THE SKIES WAS ABOUT THE 
ONLY SIMILARITY BETWEEN GREGORY (PAPPY) BOYINGTON AND JOE FOSS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One was a hard-drinking brawler who inspired a television series about his 
Black Sheep squadron. The other was a straight arrow who became a general, 
governor and football commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on who is doing the counting, one or the other is the top flying ace 
in Marine Corps history. 
</P>
<P>
 Black Sheep leader Gregory (Pappy) Boyington, who died of cancer at 75 in 
1988, and Joe Foss, 79, recently were enshrined together in the Naval Aviation 
Hall of Honor for their World War II heroics. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair of aces, both Medal of Honor winners, were friends and never 
considered themselves in competition to shoot down the most enemy planes, Foss 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Combat -- you don't look at that as a game," Foss said. "Combat's dangerous. 
You are liable to end up losing your breathing process. All we were interested 
in was knocking down every plane that we could so the suckers wouldn't be back 
the next day." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyington's record remains as controversial in death as he was in life. The 
American Fighter Aces Assn. of Mesa, Ariz., credits him with 24.5 aerial 
victories, the Naval Aviation Guide gives him 25.5 and his Marine Corps 
biography puts the number at 28. 
</P>
<P>
 That's two more than Foss, but Foss still can be considered the top Marine ace 
because all 26 of his kills came as a Marine. Boyington's 28 total included six 
kills as a Flying Tiger in China. The Aces Assn. and Naval Aviation Guide 
credit him with fewer Flying Tiger victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Flying Tigers is the nickname of the American Volunteer Group, mostly former 
U.S. military pilots, who flew for the Chinese air force before America's entry 
into World War II. The AVG later was incorporated into the U.S. Army and many 
pilots such as Boyington returned to their former services or duties. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hall of Honor is part of the National Museum of Naval Aviation at the 
Pensacola Naval Air Station. That's where Foss, who returned for the 
enshrinement, and Boyington met in 1940. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back 50 some years ago when I was roaming around here I never had any idea 
I'd be receiving any honors," Foss said. "I was just figuring maybe I'd be 
lucky to get through the training." 
</P>
<P>
 Foss, now residing in Phoenix, left the Marines as a major, but advanced to 
brigadier general in the South Dakota Air National Guard. 
</P>
<P>
 He was twice elected governor of South Dakota in the 1950s. Foss later served 
as commissioner of the American Football League, president of the National 
Rifle Assn. and host of television outdoors programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyington's fame revived when his 1958 autobiography, "Baa Baa Black Sheep," 
became a television series of the same name, later retitled "Black Sheep 
Squadron," in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Actor Robert Conrad played Boyington as a likable rogue, but that was a 
sanitized version of the real thing, the ace's son said after the enshrinement 
ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a lot tougher. He was smart and clever and pugilistic," said retired 
Air Force Lt. Col. Gregory Boyington Jr. "He enjoyed the rowdiness of the men. 
He loved it. He wasn't a bad guy, but he was a tough guy." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a great fighter pilot, great shot and could handle an airplane as well 
or better than anyone else," Foss recalled. "His only problem was with alcohol. 
When he drank . . . he'd want to whip somebody twice his size." 
</P>
<P>
 Boyington acknowledged his drinking problem and told of overcoming it in the 
final chapter of his book. 
</P>
<P>
 Television also portrayed the Black Sheep as military misfits. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a crock," said Foss, who reviewed the show for TV Guide. "What they 
were was a pool of people waiting to make replacements. . . . That wasn't any 
group of bandits or guys waiting for court-martial." 
</P>
<P>
 But Foss said it was an interesting story and he watched every show. 
</P>
<P>
 Foss got all his victories on the first of two tours in the South Pacific from 
September, 1942, through April, 1943. Shortly before he went home to give war 
bond speeches and train new pilots, Boyington arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe's final score was 26 before the Marines finally yanked him out of combat, 
full of malaria and worn down to a nub, and the first American to tie Eddie 
Rickenbacker's World War I record," Boyington wrote in his book. 
</P>
<P>
 His most remarkable feat came on his final day at Guadalcanal. Foss led a 
group of eight Marine F4F Wildcats and four Army P-38 Lightings that 
intercepted a Japanese force of more than 100 fighters and bombers. 
</P>
<P>
 Foss played hide-and-seek in the clouds to keep the Japanese guessing how many 
planes he had. He stalled long enough for the rest of the American planes, 
parked like sitting ducks, to get airborne. The Japanese fell for the bluff, 
aborted their attack and dropped their bombs in the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Foss had not fired a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyington, an Idaho native who grew up in Tacoma, Wash., had to talk his way 
into a command after recovering from a broken ankle suffered in a brawl. He 
suggested the replacement pilots be used to create a new squadron. 
</P>
<P>
 His Black Sheep called him "Pappy." He considered it a form of respect, 
figuring it was because at 30 he was older than the other pilots, none over 22. 
Boyington wrote that he later found he actually got the name because he had 
reminded his pilots of a flight school legend about a white-bearded instructor 
who never failed anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Boyington himself was shot down and spent the last 20 months of the war as a 
prisoner. After retiring as a colonel to Burbank, Calif., his civilian 
occupations included that of wrestling referee and beer salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The religious Foss recalled visiting Boyington shortly before his death. 
</P>
<P>
 "I witnessed to him . . . because I figured one of these days he was about to 
be a-leaving," Foss said. "He just listened. He never said anything. But I have 
a hunch that he . . . will be sitting up there in heaven when we come by."

<P>
 Five inmates overpowered four guards and stole keys to escape from a 
medium-security state prison early Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The inmates took one guard's Jeep, which was later found about 20 miles away 
in the middle of the Shenandoah Valley, said Department of Corrections 
spokesman Jim Jones. State and local authorities with dogs searched the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The escapees were sentenced for crimes that included larceny, burglary and 
cocaine possession.

LYNCHING SURVIVOR KEEPS MEMORIES ALIVE; TRIBUTE: 80-YEAR-OLD MAN DOCUMENTS HIS 
VICTIMIZATION BY A MOB AS WELL AS HANGINGS IN HIS NEW BLACK HOLOCAUST MUSEUM. 
HE SAYS HIS STORIES AREN'T TAUGHT IN HISTORY BOOKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After 64 years, James Cameron remembers every detail of the night an enraged 
mob dragged him from his jail cell, beat him and slipped a noose around his 
neck. Two other black men died that night at the hands of the mob. Cameron was 
saved at the last minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he's documented his story and that of other lynchings for what he's called 
America's Black Holocaust Museum, a collection that opened recently in a 
dilapidated former boxing club in downtown Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Ropes from a Ku Klux Klan robe, a ceremonial KKK rifle that spits fire from 
its barrel instead of bullets, letters describing lynchings and stark black and 
white photographs of black men twisting from ropes are among the artifacts. One 
picture shows the lynching he survived. 
</P>
<P>
 The soft-spoken Cameron, now 80, with gray hair and a trim mustache, calls it 
his "Chamber of Horrors." 
</P>
<P>
 "We might have to have a nurse on duty here," Cameron said. "I'm going to do 
just like the Jewish Holocaust museum. I'm going to let it all hang out, just 
like it happened." 
</P>
<P>
 One black history professor applauded Cameron, who wrote a book describing his 
lynching titled "A Time of Terror," and gives speeches aimed at counteracting 
present-day klan activities, for preserving this bitter history. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is to never forget," said William L. Van Deburg, a professor at the 
University of Wisconsin-Madison. "I know that each generation of students has 
to be reintroduced to the more negative aspects of black history that don't get 
portrayed in the popular media." 
</P>
<P>
 Historians agree that about 3,500 blacks were lynched in the United States 
from the 1880s to the 1960s. Cameron said his research indicates a much higher 
number. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first two years of the Reconstruction, 1865-67, over 50,000 of us were 
lynched in this country," he said. "Fifteen thousand got away with our lives 
and an estimated 35,000 met death. People don't know the history. They don't 
teach it in school." 
</P>
<P>
 His own attack took place on a summer's night in 1930 in Marion, Ind., after 
Cameron, then 16, and his two friends decided to rob someone. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameron said he took a gun, walked up to a parked car and ordered the white 
couple out. But he recognized the man as a customer at his shoeshine stand. He 
handed the gun to his friend and ran. 
</P>
<P>
 Shots rang out behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 All three teen-agers were arrested. The next day, news that the man had died 
-- and false rumors that the woman had been raped -- inflamed the town's 
residents. At nightfall the mob broke through the jail door. 
</P>
<P>
 His two friends were beaten and hanged. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was able to look down from the second story and see all the mayhem being 
committed on my two buddies," Cameron recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 He too was taken outside and beaten. A noose was placed around his neck before 
someone yelled out that he hadn't been involved in the shooting. The mob let 
him go and returned him to the jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameron served four years in prison as an accessory to manslaughter. Almost a 
lifetime later, the retired boiler engineer and self-taught historian was 
pardoned, in February, 1993, by Indiana Gov. Evan Bayh, who noted his 
accomplishments and that he had been a victim of mob violence.

LEFTOVERS FROM SWANK HOTELS FEED INDIA'S POOR; FOOD BANK: THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN 
FEAST ON SUCH DELICACIES AS CROISSANTS, CASHEW PILAF AND CREAMY LENTIL SOUP, 
THANKS TO AN INDIAN DOCTOR AND AN AMERICAN ENGINEER.

<P>
 As it rolled into the slum schoolyard, children shouted, "The blue van has 
come! The blue van has come!" 
</P>
<P>
 When the van had stopped, the children crowded inside, jostling, clutching 
stainless steel plates, finally obeying their teachers and sitting on the floor 
in a row. Volunteers scurried around the mobile kitchen, heating croissants, 
cashew pilaf, creamy lentil soup, potato curry. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of children whose families can afford only bread and water feast on 
such delicacies at least once a week, thanks to an American engineer of Indian 
descent and an Indian doctor who collect food from luxury hotels, caterers, 
airlines and factory cafeterias. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to fight hunger and combat food wastage," said Virender Kumar Bhalla, 
who started India's first food bank four years ago after watching a television 
show about a soup kitchen in Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Bhalla, who lives in Albertson, a town on New York's Long Island, said it was 
the first anniversary of his mother's death, an occasion many Hindus mark by 
feeding the poor for a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told my wife, 'If in the U.S., which produces more food than anywhere else 
in the world, they take steps to reduce wastage, why not in India?' " Bhalla 
said. "We can feed thousands of people every day. It will be the best tribute 
to Mom.' " 
</P>
<P>
 His friend B. M. Abrol, a New Delhi surgeon who had been a visiting professor 
at Boston and Michigan State universities, offered to manage the project. Abrol 
told Bhalla he had wanted to help poor people since the 1950s, when he saw 
thousands of starving people during a famine in northern India. 
</P>
<P>
 After studying food banks in the United States, Bhalla flew to India and 
talked hoteliers into donating leftover food. The Agya Wanti Bhalla Food Bank, 
named for his mother, was born. 
</P>
<P>
 Bhalla bought two vans and financed the project for the first two years. Now 
donations have begun coming in from India and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Each morning, volunteers head out in the two blue vans to pick up the food and 
take it to orphanages, centers for handicapped students and public schools in 
slums. All day and well into the night, the vans crisscross the capital, 
picking up and delivering food. 
</P>
<P>
 All the food is tasted by donor kitchen staffs and volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't hand out anything that we ourselves wouldn't eat," saiK. Sibal, 
executive chef of the Hotel Ashok, where visiting presidents and prime 
ministers stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "All hotels cook more than needed," he said. "We used to throw out at least 
100 portions of perfectly good food every day, since we are not allowed to 
serve leftovers to our guests." 
</P>
<P>
 The food bank has worked so well that volunteers have started a similar 
program in the southern city of Madras and another is planned in Bombay. 
</P>
<P>
 "We started with 50 people in New Delhi," Abrol said. "Today we feed 2,000. By 
December it will be 5,000, by the end of the decade 15,000." 
</P>
<P>
 He hopes to extend the program to villages in a project called Mushtidaan. 
Participants will be encouraged to set aside a fistful of rice, wheat or 
lentils every day and donate the food to a community kitchen at the end of each 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 "A fistful of grain can help end hunger in India," Abrol said.

PLATOON'S LONE SURVIVOR WOULD DO IT ALL OVER AGAIN

 When Trinh Phi Binh shows up with a van full of schoolbooks to deliver, 
grinning like Mister Rogers, you expect war stories of a gentle nature. But he 
was a trail driver. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got through many more bombings than I can count, day and night " Binh said, 
still grinning as he pointed out his various wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the stuff had to move, and we moved it." 
</P>
<P>
 Binh and thousands like him drove the Ho Chi Minh Trail, recruits in their 
teens and 20s, each shuttling the same truck back and forth on a single short 
stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 It worked better that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes we made only 2 kilometers (1.2 miles) a day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You had to know every hole in the road, every quirk of your truck and the 
guys who shared the dangers." 
</P>
<P>
 He was the only survivor of his 17-man platoon -- and only just. 
</P>
<P>
 Binh's father had already collected the $10 in death benefits when he learned 
that his son was still alive. 
</P>
<P>
 But Binh did not see his father again. 
</P>
<P>
 In another foul-up at the war's end, the army messaged Binh that his wife 
died. Since he had no wife, he did not rush home. After nine years, he could 
wait. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks later, he discovered that the death was his father's, and he had missed 
the funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the B-52s scared Binh. Then he figured out the American bombers 
punched a clock. If they came at 9 a.m. and noon, say, drivers could roll until 
the last minute and then jump in a ditch. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse were the AC-130 gunships, the time-delay bombs or the magnetic mines 
that leaped at passing metal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I threw away four or five trucks," he said. "Besides the bombing, we were 
forever slipping off the trail in the rain and mud." 
</P>
<P>
 Now 45, Binh said he would do it all again tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he got malaria, he laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course," he said. "Often we had high fevers, but we kept on driving. At 
that age, you're not afraid of anything."

SEARS, A CASUALTY OF 'FINANCIAL SYNERGISM' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Sears Gets Back to Basics" (Nov. 11) suggests that the era of great financial 
synergism, as taught in business school MBA programs, has come full cycle.One 
theory being that if you sell homes you can also sell insurance, appliances, 
home repairs, furniture, IRAs, ad infinitum. It never worked in the real world, 
and many corporations besides Sears were sucked up into the frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Merrill Lynches, Prudentials and others have all bailed out of this 
fiasco, but what will happen to all the MBAs who led them down the path? 
Perhaps the business schools could re-evaluate what they are teaching and why.

CLEAN AIR, A HEALTHY ECONOMY: IT CAN BE DONE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James Flanigan demonstrated real perceptiveness and insight in focusing on one 
of the most serious economic dilemmas facing all of Southern California: how to 
achieve clean, healthy air and at the same time not only preserve but enhance 
our economy, which is our engine for producing jobs and prosperity ("Deals in 
Smoke-Filled Rooms Could Help Clear the Region's Air," Nov. 9). 
</P>
<P>
 The editorial board of The Times also displayed its grasp of the importance of 
this issue to Southern California when it offered Mayor Richard Riordan an 
opportunity to discuss his innovative and pragmatic proposal of an air quality 
plan.The mayor asked me to join him in that meeting, in my capacity as a board 
member of the South Coast Air Quality Management District. 
</P>
<P>
 Together we outlined for The Times' editors his plan to satisfy state and 
federal requirements and be approved by them and the AQMD in time to meet the 
deadlines facing us, thereby averting the imposition of strict federal 
sanctions ruinous to Southern California's economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The important lesson for all of us is that the AQMD, as our regional air 
quality agency, is not our enemy. It is not a barrier to a healthy regional 
economy. Rather, it should be viewed as a tool that labor, business, 
environmentalists and local governments can jointly use to solve our pressing 
dilemma. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulling disparate interests together to work jointly on behalf of Southern 
California's economy is not a pipe dream; it can be done, and it has been done. 
</P>
<P>
 Its importance is that it will help Southern Californians appreciate the value 
and urgency of putting aside our parochial interests and working together for 
both cleaner air and a stronger economy.

WHY NOT REGULATE HMOS AS INSURERS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thank you for revealing what must be a closely guarded secret: that HMOs are 
regulated by the California Department of Corporations. It is unfortunate this 
information was in the Business section ("State Fines HMO $500,000 in Case of 
Girl With Cancer," Nov. 18) where it might be missed by many readers.Who other 
than businessmen know of the existence of this body? Why does it, rather than 
the insurance commissioner, regulate HMOs? 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when people expect insurance problems to be handled by the insurance 
commissioner, health problems to be handled by the health department and crime 
problems to be handled by the police department, why doesn't anyone expect HMO 
irregularities to be handled by the California Department of Corporations? 
Perhaps because no reasonable person would expect a bureau they never heard of 
and can't locate to be of help.

ANOTHER MAN'S VIEW OF HUGHES AIRCRAFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I just finished reading a letter to you from a retired Hughes Aircraft Co. 
employee about the "Discrimination Award and Hughes' Culture" (Nov. 13). Let me 
quote a portion of it: "Hughes Aircraft Company was founded by that great 
engineer but alleged racist Howard Hughes. As a result, its culture has long 
been typified by a 'closed elite family' personality. Family membership is 
reserved for white males who are mostly overly impressed with their intellect 
and arrogant in their deference to equal opportunity. A family that nonwhite 
males have found almost impossible to penetrate. Basically, Hughes' culture 
implants and encourages the belief that negative stereotypes of minorities are 
valid." 
</P>
<P>
 I too am a Hughes retiree, but I must have worked for a different company with 
the same name. Never in my 30 years at Hughes did I see the slightest evidence 
of company-sanctioned racism. I saw a black who started as a technician who is 
now in charge of manufacturing. I worked for and with African Americans, 
Chinese, Japanese, Jews, Mexicans, Iranians, Indians, Vietnamese, every 
nationality you can think of. As far as I can tell, we all got along 
marvelously. I admit that I am not a minority so may have missed some slights 
that others were more sensitive to, but I doubt it. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, I am so against prejudice that I would not work for a company where I 
thought it officially existed. If such a thing did exist, it was so subtle as 
to be vanishingly small. Certainly there was no overt official discrimination 
-- just the opposite. Every effort was made to promote minorities, and they 
were promoted. 
</P>
<P>
 That is not to say that there weren't individuals working there who were 
racists or prejudiced. I think you will always find a few among any group of 
people, but the point is the company was not involved. I cannot comment on the 
merits of the discrimination case against Hughes as I haven't sufficient 
knowledge. I am only reporting what I observed.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: INCEST: SEXUAL POLITICS OR A MATTER OF THERAPY AND RECOVERY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN ABCARIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A full-page newspaper ad -- a public service announcement -- is tacked to the 
wall next to my desk. Most of the page is taken up by a photograph of a little 
girl who looks strikingly like my own. This little girl, though, is dead; she 
was killed by a drunken driver in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture is there to remind me of several things: of the power of anecdote 
to illustrate truth, of the intolerance toward a particularly dangerous kind of 
anti-social behavior, and of the successful politicization of an issue by a 
group of people -- mothers -- who decided enough was enough. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not OK to drive drunk anymore. And if you get caught, you will be 
punished. 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder: Could you say the same about incest? 
</P>
<P>
 This question came up the other day in a conversation with Louise Armstrong, a 
writer with a biting sense of irony who sometimes refers to herself as the 
"World's First Walking, Talking Incest Victim." She also has a great sense of 
humor. Obviously, with these credentials, she has to. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, with great hope, Armstrong published a book called "Kiss Daddy 
Goodnight," a compendium of anecdotes about incest, including her own. She 
quoted -- from letters and interviews -- the stories of women who had been 
sexually abused as children, adolescents and teen-agers, almost always by their 
fathers. 
</P>
<P>
 No one denies that some mothers do terrible things to their kids or that 
fathers can also rape sons, but Armstrong argues forcefully against making 
incest a "gender neutral" issue since the overwhelming number of cases involve 
fathers and daughters. Mainly, she says, incest is a case of fathers acting out 
a misguided sense of male privilege, one that to this day plenty of people do 
not think is such a terrible thing. (As in, "You have to understand at the 
time, I thought I was doing my daughter a favor." As in, "If I would get angry 
with my wife, I would say hell with her, I've got my daughter.") 
</P>
<P>
 "Kiss Daddy Goodnight" lifted the lid. Or seemed to. But what Armstrong and 
others who dared speak had hoped would materialize -- a true intolerance of 
what amounted to the sexual enslavement of children -- never really occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened instead, Armstrong argues outrageously and persuasively in her 
new book, "Rocking the Cradle of Sexual Politics: What Happened When Women Said 
Incest," was that incest veered away from the political, then went roaring down 
the therapy/recovery road. It became a mental health issue instead of a 
criminal justice/political issue. Incest became about adult women seeking to 
heal the wounds suffered in childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the switch from the feminist to the therapeutic ideology," Armstrong 
writes, "with its muzzy-minded focus on incest survivors as the neurasthenics 
of the 1990s -- that has framed a lousy and truly destructive . . . experience 
as an individual disease, rather than as the result of an ingrained social 
disorder." 
</P>
<P>
 Too, she argues, there is no crossover between adults in recovery and children 
who are suffering from abuse now . 
</P>
<P>
 It is still very rough going for children who make accusations of incest. 
Often, they are put into foster care, subjected to years of court battles and 
forced therapy, and, as Armstrong documents, may even wind up in the custody of 
the very parent they claimed abused them. 
</P>
<P>
 Mothers have also found themselves involved in legal nightmares, alternately 
accused of not knowing what was going on when they should have or of making up 
allegations to gain custody in nasty divorce cases. Armstrong cites several 
studies showing that charges of sexual abuse are not more prevalent in custody 
and visitation cases than elsewhere. And, according to one law review article 
she quotes, "Mothers who make claims of sexual abuse in the context of divorce 
proceedings often lose custody as a result." 
</P>
<P>
 Already murky waters were further muddied when the issue of incest and child 
sexual abuse became entwined in the public imagination with claims of satanic 
ritual abuse, the burgeoning controversy over "recovered" memories and blanket 
assertions by authors of self-help books to the effect that "if you think you 
were abused, you were." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue became so convoluted, the claims so preposterous, Armstrong says, 
that "ordinary, household" incest retreated as an issue, overtaken by the 
carnival atmosphere that attended the freaky sideshows, which continue to play 
out, ad nauseum, on America's TV talk shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are sick of it," she says. "People wish it would go away." 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of people are going to wish Armstrong would go away -- among them, I 
should think, the women who have worked hard with therapists and support groups 
to overcome the effects of sex abuse. Why, for example, can't healing and 
political activism coexist? 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever her flaws, though, Armstrong is impossible to dismiss. 
</P>
<P>
 Amid all the noise, she argues convincingly that incest is, fundamentally, a 
way some little girls are socialized to be women by submitting to the sexual 
demands of the men they trust most. That is why she calls incest "the cradle of 
sexual politics," why she rues its takeover by the mental health industry. 
</P>
<P>
 And she has a point: "Certainly, as a result of drunk driving, many, many 
people are wounded and maimed and many people are grievously bereft. However, 
no one felt the need to go on television 40 times a day displaying wounds. 
Instead, they organized as Mothers Against Drunk Driving and politically acted, 
and that is what we are talking about here." 
</P>
<P>
 It's what we should talk about anyway.

 Raider fans. You can love them, leave them -- even arrest them.Followers of 
the Silver & Black have long believed in altering the team's motto of "A 
Commitment to Excellence" to "A Commitment to Rowdiness." And for the 13 
seasons since the team moved from Oakland to Los Angeles, "Just Win, Baby" has 
often become "Just Sin, Baby" in the Coliseum stands. But during a recent game 
against the New Orleans Saints, life was good, security high and intoxication 
of victory overshadowed that of the usual ne'er-do-wells.

ON WARM MEMORIES OF THE FUZZY LINT TRAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re: "Meet the Masters of a New Universe" (Nov. 18). It was heartening to 
discover I was not a lone soldier in the world of soiled garments.I, too, love 
the lint trap. The secure feeling of an arm full of warm terry-cloth towels is 
beyond words. 
</P>
<P>
 I was an electrician for 22 years when I missed a step and fell 25 feet to a 
concrete floor. As I recovered, I missed doing something that was constructive. 
 
</P>
<P>
 While I was still on crutches, and my wife and kids were working or at school, 
I started gathering up and sorting the clothes. Once I got started I couldn't 
stop. It sure beats laying conduit in a wet ditch on a cold morning in 
February. 
</P>
<P>
 A warning should be issued to all men thinking about participating in this 
wonderful activity. If you're doing the laundry for anyone but yourself, make 
absolutely sure you check the pockets. There is no more horrifying sight in the 
world than opening your dryer to discover everything stained with ink, lip balm 
or gum. If anyone out there knows how to get ink out of a pair of chinos after 
going through the dryer, let me know.

 Poor dears, feeling lonely and wanted to generate a bit of mail? Certainly 
there can be no other reason to print Gene Weingarten's parody, "But Then, 
Women Can Find Their Own Socks" (Nov. 1). 
</P>
<P>
 Just don't expect all the hate mail to come from humorless women who failed to 
get the point. I got the joke, and I still hated it. You can expect some mail 
from humorless men, however, who will want to elect Mr. Weingarten President or 
possibly God.

 Thank you for at last vindicating the one thing I've always done the best and 
enjoyed the most when it comes to housework -- laundry. 
</P>
<P>
 You have no idea what a wonderful feeling it is to know that I am not alone in 
the elation I feel when the lint comes off the lint trap in one piece. 
</P>
<P>
 While some housewives may think this whole thing rather silly, I feel a 
certain sense of accomplishment when I remove the final product from the dryer 
or line. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's therapeutic or something -- I don't really know. But it's nice to 
know that at least I'm not alone in my obsession.

HER DUTY IS TO SERVE HER COUNTRY -- NOT MEN

<TEXT>

 Re "Tailhook Behind Her, She Starts a New Life" (Nov. 8): Kudos to Paula 
Coughlin, late of the U.S. Navy, for coming forward and bringing to light what 
has been going on in the military (all branches) for as many years as we women 
have been serving our country -- that there are those narrow-minded male 
simians who also thought we were there to serve them. 
</P>
<P>
 How wrong can a man be? 
</P>
<P>
 It has been 40 years since I took an oath to serve and protect my country. I 
marched, trained, schooled and saluted and took pride in wearing the Air Force 
uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 I really thought I was serving my country until I was rudely awakened to what 
some of the military thought about women in the service. Talk about 
disillusion. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that nothing has changed. Perhaps what needs to be changed is to get 
rid of the top brass and re-educate the rest, starting in basic training.

UP ALL NIGHT: SOCIAL CLIMES; FILM NOIR . . .OR WITH CREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HILLARY JOHNSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every Wednesday evening, the tiny Lou De Cris Cafe (pronounced ludicrous ) in 
West Hollywood becomes an informal screening room where filmmakers, 
movie-makers and video artists of every stripe gather to view each other's work 
while rubbing elbows, knees and wits over cups of strong coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 The narrow space is furnished in typical coffeehouse style with tables, sofas 
and coffee tables. Hanging on the putty-colored walls are huge mirrors and an 
assortment of artworks that are, of course, for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The close quarters and large communal tables encourage people to get to know 
one another. Tall tales are told and opinions expressed. 
</P>
<P>
 The films are shown on a large monitor hanging from the ceiling. With a 
maximum occupancy of 40, there isn't a bad seat in the house. The downside is 
that there may not be a seat at all if you fail to reserve one. On a recent 
night, several people who had been tentatively admitted on a standby basis were 
politely eighty-sixed before the program got under way because there were 
apparently very few no-shows. 
</P>
<P>
 The clientele is artsy and lean, and about evenly male and female. Almost 
everyone is connected with the art of film, if not the industry, but this is 
not the kind of place CAA agents go to scout for talent. It's a place for 
aficionados, on the whole populated by more graduates of AFI (American Film 
Institute) than USC. No boy wonder directors in baseball caps here, whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I wanted to have happen is for filmmakers to meet, see each other's 
films and network," says owner Lou de Cristofaro. The eclectic series is 
organized by Kirk Stricker, who makes sure the mix stays unpredictable. "We do 
all different kinds of things," Stricker says. "In December we're having a 
Frank Zappa tribute." 
</P>
<P>
 "They respect the films here. There isn't a laser light show going on in the 
background," says filmmaker Silvanus Slaughter, who comes regularly. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Wednesday evening, the works of several women filmmakers were 
presented. The offerings spanned diverse styles, from glossy film student 
thesis to music video, melodrama and political statement. The work was uneven, 
which is one of the refreshing things about the series: the sense that the 
experience is relatively unfiltered. There are few such opportunities to see 
film that is not commercial product; in other words, film that one is required 
to evaluate. 
</P>
<P>
 After a break, director Kristine Peterson showed clips from her films and took 
questions from the audience. Peterson has directed several action-adventure 
films and is billed as "almost certainly the only woman to direct a martial 
arts film ('Redemption')." 
</P>
<P>
 The question, "How did you get into the action genre?" leads to several 
stories from Peterson's dues-paying days working for schlockmeister Roger 
Corman. "He really will let anybody direct," Peterson says. "The way that he 
fires people is that he lets them direct. Their job just isn't there anymore 
when they get back." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Peterson nor the audience shows any sign of flagging by 11:30 p.m., 
and eventually series organizer Stricker asks for one last question. He allows 
two, after which people mill about, chatting with new acquaintances, reluctant 
to head for the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Cristofaro is pleased with the ambience. "It's taken about a year to get here, 
but this is what I wanted to have happen," he says. "We even made it into 
Esquire this month," he adds with a twinkle of pride. "We're listed under 
'Worst Name for a New Restaurant.' "

THE BUZZ: SOCIAL CLIMES; RODEO DRIVE SHIFTS GEARS FOR EVENT

 All that remains of that once-stunning turkey is a dried-out carcass, and 
you've exhausted all the sales at every major mall within a 10-mile radius. So 
the seasonal fun is over? Hardly! 
</P>
<P>
 Next weekend you could be slumming it at the "Happy Harley Days" festival in 
Beverly Hills. There are things coming to Rodeo Drive that haven't been seen in 
these parts before. The famed street will be shut down Dec. 4 so that some 
20,000 hog-loving people can take part in this daylong event to raise money for 
Camp Ronald McDonald for Good Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the attractions are decidedly downscale -- McDonald's will have a 
stand, marking the first time the ubiquitous Golden Arches has set up shop in 
Beverly Hills. A tattoo booth will offer temporary body-enhancing designs (for 
the permanent kind, head a little farther east). And hundreds of motorcyclists 
plan to show up, engines ripping. 
</P>
<P>
 If you haven't bought all your Christmas gifts, a (not-so) silent auction 
offers items such as customized Harley jackets by Gianfranco Ferre, Todd 
Oldham, Guess, Cartier and Tiffany. 
</P>
<P>
 And for the young ones who aren't quite ready to burn rubber? Get them a 
Harley-Davidson tricycle, of course. 
</P>

 Tea Time: And we thought we knew everything: Evidently, sipping a half-decaf, 
nonfat latte or any other number of overly complicated coffee drinks at some 
funky cafe is not the hippest way to pass the time in L.A. anymore.  
</P>
<P>
 It took a press release to let us know that a Yogi Tea cappuccino is now the 
drink of choice among those who spurn the bean. The tea is ground as fine as 
espresso and put through a machine just like the hard stuff. Mix with a little 
steamed milk (or soy milk, if you have that dairy aversion thing) et voila , a 
Yogi Tea cappuccino. We can just hear millions of French and Italian people 
laughing now. 
</P>
<P>
 And what's going to be among the next wave of hip beverages? It's just in the 
rumor stage, mind you, but get ready for . . . the Sankaccino. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cat Treats: So you're proud of yourself because you've finished all your 
holiday shopping? What about Fluffy? Have you gotten your cat anything? Or have 
you spurned her once again this year, thinking, "She's just a cat. What does 
she know from the holidays? Anyway, she'll be happy with a used ribbon." 
</P>
<P>
 Shame on you. Cats know it's the holidays. They can smell turkey.  
</P>
<P>
 That's why we recommend indulging Fluffy in the Cat-Treats-of-the-Month from 
the Catnip Trading Co. It's in the fine tradition of the Fruit-of-the-Month, 
Dessert-of-the-Month and, of course, Potato-of-the Month clubs, and this way 
ol' Fluff will get a new treat all year 'round. And maybe she won't shred the 
couch quite as much as she has been.

SHOOTING BLANKS; ENTERTAINMENT: CULVER CITY CLAIMS GMT IS NOT A TRADITIONAL 
PRODUCING STUDIO, AND HAS CHANGED ITS TAX DESIGNATION. THE COMPANY DISAGREES, 
MAY SAY 'THAT'S A WRAP!' TO THE CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY MOORE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A commercial production studio is claiming that Culver City -- "The Heart of 
Screenland" -- has no heart when it comes to collecting revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 GMT Studios, where commercials, music videos and other footage are shot, says 
its reclassification on city tax rolls is costing its clients money -- and may 
force it to leave town. 
</P>
<P>
 For 11 years, Culver City had classified GMT as a studio. Last year, however, 
that designation was changed to "commercial rental property." That means that 
filming at GMT is considered by the city to be an on-location shoot, similar to 
shooting on a public street. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, producers who film at GMT are supposed to pay the city $230 a day 
or $1,500 a year in fees, in addition to the average $700 a day these producers 
pay to rent the company's studio space. 
</P>
<P>
 The city says it gave GMT a new tax designation after it discovered the 
company's activities were not those of a traditional motion-picture studio. 
Unlike a traditional studio, the city says, GMT makes its money mainly by 
renting out its facilities rather than by producing or co-producing its own 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 GMT disagrees -- and says it is already being deserted by clients concerned 
about the prospect of paying the city production fees. Alan Hauge, GMT 
president, says the loss of income could prompt his company to relocate, 
contributing to a trend that has seen other film business depart California. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our business is down 25% already this year," Hauge said. "This is our 
livelihood, our future here." 
</P>
<P>
 Independent producer Robert Marcarelli, who has rented studio space from GMT 
for several projects, said he will not return to GMT if there is a question 
about whether he should pay the city to film there. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not happening in other cities," Marcarelli said. "It's a highly 
competitive environment, and to levy a tax will not bode well for Culver City." 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute has prompted threats of lawsuits from both GMT and the city, which 
says it will not try to collect the disputed fees until the matter is resolved 
in court. 
</P>
<P>
 GMT was founded in Culver City in 1981, after it received permission from the 
city to convert a warehouse on Buckingham Parkway into a studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, GMT, which according to studio executives grosses more than $1 million 
a year, operates five stages and pumps more than $30,000 a year in various 
taxes into the city budget, according to company estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 GMT's main business is in short-term rentals of its studio space two or three 
days at a time -- for television commercials, television shows, music videos 
and feature films. Among the footage shot at the studio: Natalie Cole's 
"Unforgettable" video and commercials for McDonald's, Coors, Miller Light and 
many other consumer products. 
</P>
<P>
 Although GMT executives say theirs is the day-to-day business of a traditional 
studio, the Culver City Treasurer's office views it differently. 
</P>
<P>
 "Technically, GMT is a location," said Alida Ostler, revenue supervisor for 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's definition of a studio is a business that operates on property 
designated by the city as a studio zone and that makes its money from gross 
receipts on motion picture production or on production costs, according to Sue 
McCabe, city treasurer. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, McCabe says, only two such facilities in Culver City fit that 
description -- Culver Studios and Sony Entertainment Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 When Culver Studios and Sony do business with itinerant producers, the city 
says, their clients are not charged rental fees -- unless the shooting takes 
place outside the studio lot. In that case, the itinerant producers are 
required to pay the full location fees. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, city officials point out, Culver City has a handful of other 
converted warehouses where television and film production take place. All, like 
GMT, are classified as commercial property rentals and their clients pay the 
city's fees, said City Atty. Norm Herring. 
</P>
<P>
 Hauge, however, argues that other warehouse studios generally rent space for 
long-term filming projects, so the city's fees -- $230 a day or $1,500 a year 
-- are a small fraction of the overall cost. Nor do the fees make much of a 
dent in the usually long-term projects undertaken by clients of Sony and Culver 
Studios, where the budgets for movies run upward of $30 million, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (the city) said they wanted to charge us a fee that was equal in ratio to 
the others, that would be different," Hauge said. 
</P>
<P>
 GMT executives complain they have been denied their right under Culver City's 
municipal code to meet with city officials about the tax classification change. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, GMT says it didn't become aware of the reclassification until this 
year -- a year after it happened. 
</P>
<P>
 At a City Council meeting last week, city officials once again denied GMT 
executives a hearing to resolve the matter. Herring cited the city's 
preparation of a lawsuit against GMT as the reason for the refusal. 
</P>
<P>
 But the council did agree to meet in a closed session Monday to discuss the 
GMT matter. There has been no word on the outcome of that meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Hauge says Culver City will lose if the tax dispute forces his company to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
 If GMT's space is converted back to a warehouse, he says, it would generate no 
more than $645 a year in business taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no guarantee that another business that would go in there wouldn't 
generate $50,000 a year in tax revenue," Ostler responded.

EXPERIMENTAL DRUG COURT PROGRAM HEADS FOR WESTSIDE; LAW: PROJECT SEEKS TO BREAK 
OFFENDERS' CYCLE OF ARREST, COURT, JAIL AND MORE ARRESTS THROUGH TREATMENT. 
CRIMINAL CHARGES FOR THOSE WHO COMPLETE THE YEAR ARE SUSPENDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA PALERMO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Drug court, the experimental program that suspends criminal charges for 
addicts who complete a year of treatment, is headed for the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica Superior Court administrators, inspired by a recent statewide 
conference on the drug court concept, are lining up funding and health care 
providers to emulate the program that started six months ago in Downtown Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Richard Neidorf has been chosen to preside over the court-supervised 
rehabilitation program, which administrators hope will encompass Santa Monica, 
Malibu, Beverly Hills, Culver City and West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The minute we heard the crime bill was passed in Washington and we knew there 
was money for drug programs, we jumped for joy," Neidorf said. "They told me I 
was going to do it and we were going to start as soon as we could." 
</P>
<P>
 A portion of the $29 million allocated by the federal crime bill will be made 
available early next year for drug court programs across the nation. That 
development has prompted many courts to start planning programs that would make 
them eligible for a share of the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica court administrator Joi Sorensen, the project manager, said she 
is arranging meetings with presiding judges on the Westside to start a regional 
drug court by early spring. Still to be worked out are ways to supplement the 
federal funds and establish rules for handling criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-year pilot program that started in Downtown Los Angeles in May relies 
on the cooperation of prosecutors and public defenders, $225,000 from the 
county, and donated counseling from the Impact Drug and Alcohol Treatment 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, based in Pasadena, provides counseling, drug testing, acupuncture 
treatment and, when necessary, residential care for defendants who qualify for 
the program and volunteer to participate. The treatment is supplemented by 
mandatory Narcotics Anonymous or Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although administrators have not located a similar treatment program for the 
Westside drug court, Sorensen said the Clare Foundation in Santa Monica has 
volunteered. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a grass roots thing," Sorensen said. "We hope we can work with the 
Probation Department and (health care) providers to put something together." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the groundwork has been done by the founders of the program in Los 
Angeles Municipal Court, which has enrolled more than 100 people who were 
arrested for drug possession. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who are charged with selling narcotics do not qualify for the program, 
nor do defendants who have been convicted of violent felonies or sex crimes. 
The mentally ill are also disqualified. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the concept see the court-monitored treatment, including daily 
urine tests and frequent appearances before a judge, as the only hope for 
breaking the cycle of arrest, court, jail and more arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I just throw them in jail, when they get out you know they're going to use 
(drugs) again," said Neidorf, a former narcotics agent and prosecutor. "Jail 
hasn't worked in the past, except that the time they're in jail I know they're 
not stealing from Thrifty." 
</P>
<P>
 In the drug court program, criminal charges are reinstated when a participant 
repeatedly fails urine tests or shirks other requirements, such as attending 
12-Step meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Stephen A. Marcus, who oversees the Los Angeles court, estimates about 
half the participants will succeed. His drug court draws addicts from the 
South-Central, MacArthur Park and Rampart-Hollenbeck areas of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the courts have been using 12-week education programs to divert 
offenders from the criminal justice system, that approach does not work with 
acute cases of addiction, drug court advocates say. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug court movement, which started in Florida, has spawned programs in 
Oakland, Bakersfield, San Bernardino and El Monte as well as Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Am I optimistic we're going to have a great success rate? The answer is no," 
Neidorf said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But, yes, I am going to try this and give it my best shot, because nothing 
else is working."

CULTURE; ITALIAN GOVERNMENT FUNDS U.S. ARTS CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA PALERMO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an era when cultural activities are being sacrificed to balance budgets, 
Italy is creating the largest cultural establishment on the West Coast, a new 
center in Westwood designed to convey the good life, Italian style. 
</P>
<P>
 The new headquarters of the Istituto Italiano di Cultura will open in January, 
with a 100-seat movie theater, an art gallery and space for concerts, classes 
and other events, all without charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italian government spent $2.1 million to buy and remodel the former 
International Student Center on Hilgard Avenue for its new facility, which will 
collaborate with UCLA, local museums and various nonprofit foundations to share 
the essence of Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best economic investment is culture," said professor Enzo Coniglio, the 
institute's director. "Italy's poor. It has no raw materials, and it's 
overpopulated. . . . But Italy's still the fifth most industrialized country in 
the world. Why? Because we have invested in culture for centuries." 
</P>
<P>
 When Coniglio was director of the institute's San Francisco office in 1985, he 
created its Los Angeles counterpart, which opened the following year in offices 
adjoining the Italian Consulate on Wilshire Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned to Italy in 1991, but came back to Los Angeles in July to head 
what is now the institute's main office. Since then, his government's 
investment has manifested itself in poetry and film -- a retrospective showing 
of the work of Italian director Dario Argento; an exhibit at the Museum of 
Contemporary Art; a four-day conference of Italian and American poets, and last 
week's series on New Italian Cinema at UCLA's Melnitz Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, the institute will host 10 lectures on modern and contemporary 
Italian art, open its new art gallery and launch a series of monthly concerts. 
It will present the works of directors Federico Fellini and Francesco Rosi in 
February, followed by a series of new Italian films and a tribute to Roberto 
Rossellini. 
</P>
<P>
 But to Coniglio, a professor of philosophy and business administration, 
culture consists of much more than the arts. He sees it as a global village in 
which national boundaries are transcended by humanism. 
</P>
<P>
 He laments what he calls "the divorce of the body from the spirit, the 
manipulation of the masses to the needs of the economy and the market, the 
transformation of the human being into a type of merchandise." 
</P>
<P>
 "What truly matters," he said, "is not the reduction of taxes but the 
assurance of a decent life for all mankind." 
</P>
<P>
 The 47-year-old diplomat, a native of Acireale, Sicily, joined the Italian 
Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1979. After representing his government in 
Algeria, Finland, Canada and California, he has formed some pointed 
observations on the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 He decries a lifestyle based on economizing and practicality that counts 
immediate costs but ignores long-term consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not here to teach anything to our American friends," he said. "But I 
am convinced we need to create a new Renaissance, and that Renaissance needs 
communication. 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans are in a shadow moment when they don't invest in their kids 
anymore, are only concerned about their own taxes, and are not concerned about 
the quality of life of the great number of people." 
</P>
<P>
 The cross-cultural dialogue that Coniglio advocates includes computer 
technology. While working in Canada he created the on-line program "Windows on 
Italy," an English-language information network that is available on the 
Internet. He now is campaigning for inclusion of the program on Los Angeles 
Free-Net, a fledgling local computer network. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles needs a focus," he said. "In Italy there is the piazza, with the 
church, the city hall and the pharmacy. The only thing we can do here is create 
virtual space where people can gather together. Free-Net can be a way to unify 
cities." 
</P>
<P>
 At the institute, Coniglio hopes to re-create Italy's "culture of the cafe, 
where they talk about art, culture and language," he said. "Most of our 
revolutionary things were created in these groups." 
</P>
<P>
 With a staff of six, the institute relies on volunteers and the cooperation of 
various institutions. Its aim is not to impose prepackaged culture, but to 
arrange events according to the mutual needs of co-sponsors and those on its 
mailing list of 4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our dream is to organize regular meetings where our American friends can come 
and meet Italians in an open forum of discussion," Coniglio said. "But it must 
be something challenging, avant garde, not to repeat things everybody knows, 
and not to be afraid of saying something people think is crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 He also wants to combine the institute with French, German and other national 
groups in a European cultural center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not believe in individualism," he said. "I believe in working together, 
knowing each other better, being relaxed, being well and eating well. That is 
culture. And if there is a concert, that's even better."

COMMUNITY NEWS: HOLLYWOOD; EL CENTRO CALLED 'MODEL' HOUSING PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 New tenants are moving into the refurbished Hollywood El Centro, an 
$11-million housing development that has reclaimed 70-year-old bungalows once 
plagued by gangs, drugs and graffiti. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are praising the 88-unit complex at 6211 De Longpre Ave. as an 
example of high-quality apartments for low-income residents. 
</P>
<P>
 They hope that such efforts will help reverse a chronic shortage of affordable 
housing in Hollywood, where slum conditions are rife and where less than half 
the households can afford market-rate rents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look at this as a model project for the neighborhood," said Len Betz, a 
spokesman for the Community Redevelopment Agency of Los Angeles, which helped 
fund El Centro with a $4-million loan. 
</P>
<P>
 "These units were in a real state of disrepair. They date back to the 1920s, 
and there was lots of crime in and around (the apartments). They didn't look 
like the kind of housing that could be saved . . . but (the developer) has 
renovated the units to be probably better than they ever were." 
</P>
<P>
 El Centro, which has just undergone the first of two phases of renovation, 
exemplifies a trend toward "layered" financing of low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
 As federal monies have dried up in recent years, developers have increasingly 
turned to funding partnerships involving local governments, nonprofit companies 
and banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Safran, a veteran for-profit developer of low-income housing in 
Southern California, pulled together funding for El Centro from a variety of 
public and private sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the CRA loan, the project received nearly $5 million in equity from 
Mission First, a subsidiary of Southern California Edison, plus bank loans and 
federal tax credits. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the project is technically considered a rehabilitation, "we really 
rebuilt these units," said Safran, who bought the property in 1991. "We put up 
new stucco, plumbing, electrical (wiring) and heating. . . . My goal was to 
have the equivalent of new-construction housing, and we did it." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the young families who now live at El Centro would probably have had 
trouble finding affordable housing on their own, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the newly refurbished complex, they pay a fixed percentage of their income 
for rent, as opposed to a fluctuating market rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim Tatarsky says her new one-bedroom apartment at El Centro will give her a 
chance to recover from a difficult period in her life. 
</P>
<P>
 The 27-year-old single mother was left homeless after the Northridge 
earthquake damaged her previous apartment in the Sepulveda section of the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've slept in cars, I've done everything," said Tatarsky, who at one point 
sent her 8-year-old son to live with her mother. "The fact that the rent is low 
(here) means I have the chance to go to school and pick up some more trades. . 
. . Nobody wants to stay on welfare forever." SCOTT COLLINS

COVER STORY; ARRESTING DRAMA; WITH 'REALITY' COP SHOWS HELPING CRACK TOUGH 
CASES, BEVERLY HILLS POLICE TURN TO TV VIEWERS TO SOLVE SLAYING

<P>
 The cameras started rolling. An actor playing a gunman snuck up behind another 
actor dressed as a Brink's guard, raised his pistol and fired. The guard 
crumpled to the sidewalk, and the gunman seized the bag of money and hurried 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months earlier, on Sept. 6, this scene had been played out in real life: 
Guard Dennie Plese was shot dead in a robbery outside Manufacturers Bank in 
Beverly Hills. Now a television crew was re-creating the brutal murder for the 
TV crime show "America's Most Wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 TV at its sensationalistic worst? 
</P>
<P>
 Not to Beverly Hills Police Detective Tom Linehan, who invited the "America's 
Most Wanted" crew to the scene of the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Coached by the program's producer, Linehan patiently stood before the camera, 
telling and retelling the facts of the case. Linehan has high hopes that the 
publicity will lead him to the murderer. 
</P>
<P>
 "A murder is like a puzzle. The more people we can reach through shows like 
this, the better the chances are that someone will give us a piece of 
information that will lead to an arrest," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Linehan's optimism is well-founded. Law enforcers say reality-based crime 
shows have produced impressive results, helping to solve cases across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 The two top shows, Fox's weekly "America's Most Wanted" and NBC's "Unsolved 
Mysteries," attract millions of viewers -- and thousands of tipsters who dial 
the programs' toll-free numbers to pass on tips to police. The programs enable 
law enforcement agencies to broadcast a fugitive's photograph or composite 
drawing to homes from Key West, Fla., to Weed, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
 "With law enforcement (budgets) being cut, and since our ratings are so high, 
(law enforcement) reaches out and calls us," said Tony Zanelotti, West Coast 
producer of "America's Most Wanted." "They can't beat our 10 to 15 million 
viewers." 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of "Unsolved Mysteries," whose format covers not only 
fugitives but also lost loves and missing heirs, say 40% of the suspects the 
show has identified by name or photograph have been caught since the show 
premiered in January, 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 "America's Most Wanted," which celebrated its seventh season this year, claims 
the clues it has presented have led to the capture of 329 fugitives, more than 
a third of the criminals it has profiled. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is something like 280,000 fugitives in the country, and I know that 329 
is just a little dent," said Donna Brant, a reporter for "America's Most 
Wanted." "But a lot of these cases wouldn't be solved without us." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the successes have come in local cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Homicide Detective Dan Andrews of the Los Angeles Police Department's Wilshire 
Division says eight of his cases have been featured on "America's Most Wanted," 
"Unsolved Mysteries" and NBC's recently canceled "Prime Suspect." Most of them, 
he says, have been solved with the help of tips from viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 One such effort is expected to culminate this week with the sentencing in Los 
Angeles of Franklin LeGrand Perkins, who was convicted in the murder of Lee 
Selwyn, a popular disc jockey who worked at clubs on the Sunset Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 The case illustrates not only that reality crime shows can help law enforcers, 
but also that the critical information does not always come immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 8, 1988, Selwyn and some friends were riding motorcycles and got into 
an argument with the driver of a red and white Ford Bronco. The driver of the 
Bronco chased Selwyn and forced his motorcycle into a telephone pole on La 
Cienega Boulevard, according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 When the "Unsolved Mysteries" story about the Selwyn case aired on Jan. 11, 
1989, the response was overwhelming, said Los Angeles Police Detective Dan 
Andrews. It was the first time the LAPD's Wilshire Division had ever had one of 
its cases featured on one of the reality-based programs, which were new at the 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "That show generated about a thousand clues," Andrews said, referring to the 
tips the show's telephone operators took down during the program. "We had boxes 
of computer printouts to go through." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the detectives, Andrews said, were unable to come up with a suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first we kept hanging on to the hope that there would be closure. But as 
years passed, I didn't think he'd be caught," said Lori Selwyn, Lee Selwyn's 
sister. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the show's popularity grew, "Unsolved Mysteries" was syndicated and its 
reruns began airing on several channels -- with the high-profile Selwyn murder 
case often being shown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would get a flurry of clues every time the (Selwyn) program would air," 
said Andrews, the only LAPD detective who has remained on the case since its 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing came of the tips until the program was broadcast as a rerun on the 
Lifetime channel on March 15, 1993. The call that broke the case came through 
the program's 800 number, and the anonymous tipster tied Perkins -- then 
serving time in a Georgia prison for illegal possession of firearms -- to the 
Selwyn murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Perkins was served with an indictment in the Selwyn case five days before his 
scheduled release and was extradited to Los Angeles, where he was tried and 
convicted of second-degree murder. His sentencing is scheduled for Wednesday in 
Los Angeles Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had been almost five years. I didn't tell the family, but I was 
discouraged about ever solving that case," Andrews said. "We never would have 
solved (the Selwyn) case except for 'Unsolved Mysteries.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The geographical reach of the crime programs was illustrated more dramatically 
in 1990, when "America's Most Wanted" helped lead police to the murderer of 
Hollywood resident Barry Glick, a sunglasses salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The killer, Gerald Reeves, reportedly befriended Glick and then robbed and 
fatally stabbed him in April, 1990, fleeing to Modesto in Glick's car, said 
LAPD homicide Detective Dennis Kilcoyne. In Modesto, Reeves committed a robbery 
and kidnaping and successfully eluded police -- until Kilcoyne asked "America's 
Most Wanted" to profile the Glick murder. 
</P>
<P>
 After the program aired, police were inundated with 350 telephone tips 
indicating that Reeves had traveled across the country, befriending and robbing 
women and gay men in half a dozen states. 
</P>
<P>
 When the show profiled Reeves a second time in December, a Maryland woman 
called in and said she had just spoken to Reeves, who was planning to spend 
Christmas with her daughter. Reeves was visiting the Circus Circus casino and 
hotel in Reno, she said -- a fact confirmed by other "America's Most Wanted" 
callers who said they had seen him in the casino that night. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, Reeves was captured in a Western Union office where police 
had lured him with a phony money transfer. In 1992, he was convicted of murder 
in Los Angeles and is now serving a sentence of life without parole, Kilcoyne 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such results have caught the attention of local law enforcement agencies, who 
now work closely with crime shows that many were skeptical about when such 
programming began in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Rogan, coordinating producer of "Unsolved Mysteries," estimates that his 
weekly show garners a few thousand calls during or immediately after each 
program airs. And with shows rerunning in syndication, that can add up to about 
10,000 tips a week, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the massive number of tips, it has taken the shows some time to prove 
their worth to police, Zanelotti said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we started the show, law enforcement agencies were suspicious of what we 
wanted to do, and what we could do for them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so now. Said Brant of "America's Most Wanted": "Some (police) call us the 
day after a crime occurs." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, in fact, police are practically part of the production crew. After 
successfully lobbying "America's Most Wanted" to profile the slaying of Plese, 
the Brink's guard, Linehan of the Beverly Hills Police Department appeared on 
televised interviews and voice-overs for the program. He and his partner, 
Detective Michael Hopkins, were flown to the show's headquarters in Washington 
for its airing on Nov. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 There, they were stationed at a 30-line telephone bank. Operators connected 
them with callers who appeared to have promising leads and took down other 
callers' information that the police could study later, Linehan said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the show aired, 60 calls came in. Linehan declined to discuss any 
prospective clues. But he says that one of the calls was from Plese's 
half-brother, who first learned from the TV show that his sibling had been 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime show producers say there is no guarantee that their programs will 
produce clues. Indeed, many cases profiled on crime shows have yet to be 
resolved -- among them, the disappearance of Adam Hecht, a 24-year-old tennis 
instructor who vanished from his Beverly Hills apartment in June, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Hecht's rental car was found abandoned in Beverly Hills with his wallet, 
containing cash and credit cards, inside the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Before his disappearance, police say, Hecht had expressed interest in being 
among homeless people and helping them. They speculate that he may have dropped 
out of sight to become a street person. 
</P>
<P>
 Hecht's family successfully lobbied "Unsolved Mysteries" to profile the case, 
but so far the broadcasts have failed to help explain his disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not giving up hope," said Beverly Hills Police Lt. Frank Salicido. "In 
the case of a missing person, you never know where they might be."

FOR SENIORS; MURALIST, RESTAURATEUR OFFER MUSICAL TASTE OF ITALY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's an exquisite Italian combination -- food, art and opera. 
</P>
<P>
 The food is brought to you by Gianfranco's, an authentic Italian restaurant on 
Santa Monica Boulevard in West Los Angeles with an adjoining food market that 
sells hard-to-get Italian delicacies. The art is from 77-year-old Giovanni 
Palomba, who stood on a scaffold painting a scene from Mascagni's "Cavalleria 
Rusticana" on the facade of the restaurant. And the opera is the product of a 
dream of Franco Altavilla, owner of Gianfranco's. 
</P>
<P>
 Over a meal of tortellini, cappelletti with artichoke and pasta, Palomba -- 
joined by his wife, Grace, and Altavilla -- spoke in Italian and English about 
the old days and the future of opera on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 Palomba was trained as a cameo sculptor and muralist in his native Italy, but 
his fantasy was to be in the United States. "Nobody was free, and I heard about 
freedom in America. People like me had passion. We brought something from the 
old country as a gift," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first five years after his arrival 45 years ago, Palomba was a house 
painter. But after painting a mural for a church in San Pedro, he continued as 
a muralist until a few years ago, when he had a mild stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without paint he cannot live," Grace Bicaci Palomba says. "He's very strong 
for his age, he loves to work and he wishes to die with a brush in his hand, so 
he was sad for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Enter Altavilla. He had a dream: to combine his love of opera with his 
restaurant. Altavilla, who knows the stories of every opera to come out of 
Italy, started slowly. First, the restaurant sound system played his favorite 
arias and he sold the compact discs after customers asked him where they could 
get them. Now, he wants the real thing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want people to step into a little theater where opera singers will perform 
a few nights a week," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Palomba painted the mural, Altavilla turned the restaurant into a slice 
of Milan. He created a stage area and bought an electronic piano that can 
simulate an orchestra. He sent for posters from La Scala Opera House to 
decorate the eating area. Busts of Verdi sit on pedestals around the stage, and 
drapes of wine-colored brocade will frame the windows. The opening of the opera 
stage is planned for early next year with selections from "La Boheme." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since the Three Tenors (Placido Domingo, Luciano Pavarotti and Jose 
Carreras) concert, there's more interest in opera. There are a lot of young 
people in the universities who want an opportunity to perform not only opera 
but classic Italian songs. And if customers really like it, I'll bring in 
string quartets too," Altavilla said. 
</P>
<P>
 Altavilla, a native of Oriabrindisi, Italy, met Palomba many years ago when he 
was working as a stone cutter and Palomba was painting. They became friends, 
and when Altavilla planned the refurbishing of his restaurant, he knew he 
wanted Palomba. Rather than put a neon sign up saying "Opera Sung Here," 
Altavilla envisioned a series of panels around the outside of his restaurant 
depicting scenes from operas. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was one problem, and it wasn't Palomba's stroke. 
</P>
<P>
 Palomba was accustomed to painting murals with an old-fashioned, wraparound 
scaffold made of wood and pipe. Altavilla wanted to use an electric one that 
was much smaller and mobile and wouldn't take up a lot of sidewalk space. 
Palomba walked off the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took his hand and pressed the button -- up, down -- to show him how it 
worked. Now he loves it," Altavilla said. 
</P>
<P>
 Palomba worked eight hours a day on the "Cavalleria" mural. "I gotta get out 
to work. I'm from the old-style people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Palomba finishes some more exterior work, Altavilla wants him to do some 
murals inside the restaurant. Palomba likes the idea of reproducing some of 
Michelangelo's work from the Sistine Chapel. 
</P>
<P>
 "Opera! Opera!" shouts Altavilla.

SMALL, CHEAP, BRILLIANT; COURTYARD APARTMENT COMPLEX IN ESCONDIDO USES A LOT OF 
IMAGINATION TO OVERCOME SIZE AND COST LIMITATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEON WHITESON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In our brief history, Southern Californians have been extraordinarily 
inventive in creating original housing types that have been copied across the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 We've come up with the California Bungalow, the Ranch House and the Bungalow 
Court. Of these, the Bungalow Court has proved to be the most fruitful 
invention, and its derivations continue to be built throughout the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 Like all good ideas, the concept of the Bungalow Court is simple: a cluster of 
individual houses or apartments enclosing a communal courtyard or garden. The 
aim is to increase the density of housing without entirely losing the 
individual sense of a home with distinct boundaries provided by a regular house 
on a separate lot. 
</P>
<P>
 From its beginnings in such Pasadena projects as the Bowen Court Bungalows in 
the first decade of this century, through the splendid Spanish Revival 1920s 
courtyard apartments of West Hollywood, on through the so-called "dingbat" 
apartment complexes of the 1940s and '50s, the Bungalow Court has provided a 
model for multi-household living that balances privacy with a sense of 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 (The Bungalow Court also spawned another original and now widespread building 
type: the motel. Alfred Heineman, the architect of the Bowen Court Bungalows, 
designed the 1925 Milestone Mo-tel in San Luis Obispo, America's first true 
motel.) 
</P>
<P>
 One of the best recent examples of an imaginative courtyard apartment complex 
is Sunrise Place, an eight-unit group of two-story apartments for low-income, 
mostly Latino families in a suburban section of Escondido, a city of 109,000 
about 40 miles north of San Diego.  
</P>
<P>
 Commissioned by the nonprofit North County Housing Foundation and financed by 
loans and grants from a variety of public and private sources, Sunrise Place 
draws its architectural inspiration from such Southland examples as Rudolph 
Schindler's 1923 Pueblo Rivera Courts in La Jolla and Irving Gill's 1919 
Horatio West Court in Santa Monica. Like Sunrise Place, these complexes use 
bold geometries and skillful detailing to overcome the constrictions of their 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed by the young husband-and-wife team of Rene Davids and Christine 
Killory, based in San Diego, Sunrise Place, completed in late 1993, has already 
won several prestigious national design awards. The architects' larger 
Escondido housing project, Daybreak Grove, was chosen by Time magazine as one 
of the 10 best architectural designs of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Daybreak Grove is an excellent project, but Sunrise Place is especially 
brilliant in the manner in which it overcomes the constrictions of its deep, 
narrow-fronted lot. 
</P>
<P>
 On this tight site, Sunrise Place's architects showed great skill and 
sensitivity in maintaining the essential balance between private and shared 
space, while creating a distinctive design that also blends in with its 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The site, 65 feet wide and 220 feet deep, fronts onto a suburban side street 
in a district developed in the 1980s close to an industrial area where many of 
the local residents work. The complex is flanked by a market-rate apartment 
complex and senior citizens' project; a school and a church are across the way. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sunrise Place layout is composed of two long buildings containing a mix of 
two- and three-bedroom units. These parallel blocks enclose a 20-foot-wide 
communal courtyard planted with palm trees that is the social heart of the 
complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Aesthetically, the two separate buildings are conceived as "bridge" structures 
running most of the length of the site from front to back. The central sections 
of these bridges are painted steel gray; terra cotta and yellow stucco walls 
punctuated by windows project out varying distances to enliven the long 
elevations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that the strong colors and distinctive architecture give the 
residents a sense of identity in a visually jumbled neighborhood," Killory 
said. "Apart from socially sensitive planning, bold design is the best thing 
architects can bring to these kinds of commonplace, and all-too-often ugly, 
buildings." 
</P>
<P>
 Parking for 12 cars is contained in a vine-covered gray steel pergola situated 
on the front of the site to act as a buffer between the apartments and the 
street. At the rear is a children's play area and vegetable garden surrounding 
a free-standing structure shaped like a Mayan ziggurat that contains a tiny 
outdoor theater set over a Laundromat. 
</P>
<P>
 The apartments are minimal -- the two-bedroom units are 682 square feet, the 
three-bedroom units are 900 square feet -- but inventive layouts reduce the 
feeling of being cramped. Flexible unit plans provide space for an extra 
bedroom, small office or larger living area and clerestory windows set above 
the sloping roof-lines generate air currents that provide passive cooling on 
hot summer days. 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of each apartment is the kitchen, adjacent to the open-plan 
living-dining room. Kitchens overlook the courtyard so that busy mothers can 
keep an eye on their kids at play. 
</P>
<P>
 Both two- and three-bedroom apartments contain small extravagances, such as 
double-height living rooms, to overcome the boxiness of the tightly planned 
units. Tiny entry porches for each apartment and small back patios help to mark 
the boundaries between private and public space on a confined site. 
</P>
<P>
 Because residents look out for their neighbors, there's no need for security 
measures such as a locked front gate or chain-link fencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Built for a rock-bottom $53-per-square-foot construction cost -- or $120,000 a 
unit, including land, construction and fees -- Sunrise Place rents start at 
$275 a month for families whose incomes fall between a qualifying spectrum set 
by local, state and federal agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Meant to house several generations living together, including grandparents, 
aunts, parents and children, the apartments and their communal courtyard 
accommodate the Latin tradition of the extended family. The courtyard has the 
cozy social ambience of a small placita in a Mexican village.

 Though Sunrise Place is too small to support its own social services, when 
needed, its families are guided to local services by the North County Housing 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Careful selection of tenants is the key to harmony in this kind of 
community," said Amy Rowland, executive director of the foundation. Families 
whose children belong to gangs aren't accepted, and drugs and alcohol are 
prohibited. "Everyone has to be able to get along," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vivimos todos como una familia," ("We live like one big family here,") said 
several Sunrise Place tenants. "Participamos en la vida." ("We share our 
lives.")

PROTECT YOUR FAMILY FROM POISONOUS GAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 With the tragic deaths last weekend of a father and two sons in South-Central 
Los Angeles by carbon monoxide (CO) gas, we are reminded of the danger posed by 
this material in our homes. According to the Journal of the American Medical 
Assn., carbon monoxide poisoning is the leading cause of poisoning in the 
United States, resulting in 1,500 deaths and 10,000 illnesses each year. 
</P>
<P>
 CO is an odorless, colorless gas that is emitted as a byproduct of combustion 
of fuels such as natural gas, gasoline, heating oil, coal and wood. CO deaths 
and injuries often occur when undetectable exhaust fumes seep into the living 
areas of a home from a faulty furnace, water heater, chimney or other 
appliance. 
</P>
<P>
 To help minimize the risk of this deadly gas entering the home, the Southern 
California Gas Co. recommends that their customers contact them at least once 
yearly to arrange a free safety check of all gas appliances. This is a measure 
that few homeowners realize the importance of. Many people let their furnaces, 
for example, go for years without doing any inspections or maintenance, often 
with tragic consequences. The gas company's toll-free phone number can be found 
in your local white pages. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, they strongly suggest immediate gas shut off to any appliance 
from which a gas odor is detected or that has a loose or cracked exhaust pipe 
until one of their technicians or a licensed plumbing contractor performs a 
safety inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 Other recommendations experts make to prevent CO poisoning are: 
</P>
<P>
 1 -- Never use any unvented propane or kerosene heater or cooking/barbecue 
device indoors. 
</P>
<P>
 2 -- Have your chimney inspected for safe or clean operation at least once 
yearly, and have any problem of smoke leakage into the room resolved by a 
licensed contractor before further use. 
</P>
<P>
 3 -- Never run an automobile or other gas-powered device inside a closed 
garage. 
</P>
<P>
 4 -- Use carbon monoxide detector(s) in your home. These detectors resemble 
and work like smoke alarms, emitting a loud alarm when the gas is detected. 
They are available from most large home centers in either battery or AC power 
format. At least one alarm should be placed on each level of the home, close to 
sleeping areas and in or near other rooms that get a lot of use. The battery 
powered models are made to last up to three years on a battery module and have 
the advantage over the AC design of providing protection even during a power 
outage. Either type is designed to be installed by the novice. Prices range 
from $50-$90 each.

IS PROPERTY A DANGER TO CHILDREN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CORA JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Children, closely watched or not, stray onto other people's properties sooner 
or later. Often, what draws them are everyday objects -- pools, machinery or 
stacks of building materials -- that present both an irresistible lure and 
hidden danger to young children. 
</P>
<P>
 If something on your property is both inviting and dangerous, you have a 
special legal responsibility to try to prevent injuries to children who may 
wander onto the property. In many states, this rule is called the "attractive 
nuisance" doctrine. It can be roughly summarized with three rules: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Children are not expected to fully realize the dangers they may encounter. 
</P>
<P>
 -- A property owner who should realize that children are likely to come onto 
the property has a heightened responsibility to prevent harm. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An owner who fails to take reasonable precautions to prevent injury is 
usually liable for a child's injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 What Is an Attractive Nuisance? 
</P>
<P>
 An attractive nuisance is a potentially harmful object so inviting or 
interesting to a child that it would lure the child onto the property to 
investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 An unenclosed swimming pool, for instance, or a fountain containing goldfish 
could be attractive nuisances. Ordinary objects can attract and injure children 
-- an idling lawn mower, paint sprayer, table saw, even the family auto. 
Children are also fascinated by construction sites and equipment, gasoline 
pumps, wells, tunnels, dumpsters, paths and stairways. 
</P>
<P>
 You may be thinking that almost anything could injure a small child. After 
all, even a stick in the yard can be picked up and poked into an eye. Yet a 
stick is not so unusual or enticing as to draw children over at their peril. 
</P>
<P>
 And not every dangerous condition is an attractive nuisance. Most natural 
conditions, such as a lake or a naturally steep bank, are not considered 
attractive nuisances. To be liable for injury, an owner must create or maintain 
the harmful object. 
</P>
<P>
 And even a very small child is presumed by the law to understand some dangers 
-- for example, falling from a height or touching fire. The attractive nuisance 
doctrine arises when the child doesn't realize the extent of the danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Who Is Protected 
</P>
<P>
 Very young children are far from the only ones protected by the law. Judges 
tend to look at each particular case and each individual child's capacity to 
understand danger. For example, an Alabama court found that a 16-year-old boy 
may not have understood the dangers of exploring an abandoned clay pit and the 
owner could be liable when the boy was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some more examples, from actual lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 A 12-year-old child climbed onto the roof of a building to play and fell three 
stories to the ground. The owner was held liable, for these reasons: Children 
were known to play in the area; the roof itself had an area that was sloped and 
slippery, something that a child would not notice, and the owner could easily 
have locked the door to the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 A 10-year-old fell three stories from a roof after climbing up and playing on 
it. The owner was not held legally responsible for the child's injuries because 
this owner had no reason to know that children would play on the roof; no 
hidden danger on the roof itself caused the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 An 11-year-old girl, investigating a home-building site, was injured when 
stacked Sheetrock tumbled down on her. A judge ruled there were grounds for a 
lawsuit against the contractor who stacked the material because children were 
likely to come onto the building site; the Sheetrock was left unattended for 
days, and it could have easily been stacked in a safer manner. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking Precautions 
</P>
<P>
 The law doesn't require owners to childproof their properties. But it expects 
people to be alert to potential dangers to children and to take reasonable 
steps to prevent harm to those too young to understand the danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Follow Local Laws 
</P>
<P>
 Local laws often regulate objects that are dangerous to inquisitive children. 
By far the strictest regulations apply to that increasingly common danger, the 
back yard swimming pool. You can look up these laws at your local public 
library or law library. 
</P>
<P>
 Use Good Judgment 
</P>
<P>
 The best way to avoid tragic accidents is to use good common sense. If 
something on your property fascinates neighborhood children, they can be 
expected to trespass and investigate it, if given the chance. Lock it up, fence 
it or remove it. If an object is an accident waiting to happen -- a ladder 
propped against a roof or a machine left running -- never leave it unattended. 
</P>
<P>
 Ask your insurance agent what precautions you should take concerning dangerous 
but necessary objects -- for instance, swimming pools, wells or machinery. If 
the company requires a fence, install it, or you could lose your coverage. And 
don't be surprised if your premiums increase for the pleasure of having a pool, 
trampoline or other object. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are a concerned parent, this may be a good time to be a meddlesome 
neighbor. Assume the neighbor wants to know about dangerous conditions, and 
offer to help find a solution. If a law is being violated and the neighbor 
won't cooperate, contact the appropriate authorities. Typical Local Laws 
</P>
<P>
 Laws usually cover these and other hazards: 
</P>
<P>
 Pools. Your community may require certain kind of fences and locks. 
</P>
<P>
 Discarded refrigerators. Almost every town has a law requiring the removal of 
doors, preventing a curious child from suffocation. 
</P>
<P>
 Fences. Laws prohibiting barbed wire below a certain height level protect 
children from sharp barbs, which they might not expect. 
</P>
<P>
 Old cars and other junk. Such eyesores, which to a child might be inviting, 
are in most places prohibited unless they are fenced. 
</P>
<P>
 Dangerous dogs. State or local laws require owners to keep dogs away from 
people if the dogs are known to be dangerous. 
</P>
<P>
 Chemicals. Federal, state and local laws regulate how to store or dispose of 
pesticides, paints and other hazardous chemicals.

CONDO Q&A: HOW TO MAKE BOARD COMPLY WITH THE RULES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HICKENBOTTOM, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: The board of directors of my homeowner association does not respond 
to letters from the owners. We have tried to obtain a financial statement for 
this year and the past year. The bylaws state that all owners are supposed to 
receive a copy of the audited financial statement at each annual meeting. 
However, the report has not been distributed for the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawsuit has been filed against one of the owners, but the board will not 
tell us how much money has been spent on the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Is the association accountable to any governmental agency? Does any agency 
monitor the association's activities? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Though there are many laws contained in the Civil Code that dictate 
how community associations must operate, there is no state or local agency that 
has the authority to oversee them after the original sales are completed and 
the developer has departed. 
</P>
<P>
 Boards of directors are required to carry out certain duties on behalf of the 
association, but there is no enforcement other than peer pressure and sometimes 
legal action initiated by their fellow owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Community associations are supposed to operate as democracies, but 
unfortunately, the democratic process sometimes gets pushed aside or ignored by 
negligent, uninformed or power-focused board members. There are board members 
who say, "If you don't like the way we're running the association, sue me." 
When that is the board's philosophy, everyone's investment suffers and 
democracy disappears. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners are often apathetic because they don't want to make waves or they don't 
want to take the time to correct a bad situation. They need to be reminded that 
their investment is threatened by a non-performing board. If one of the owners 
is selling a unit, a recent financial report must be provided to a potential 
buyer. The board could be held responsible if the proper financial reports are 
unavailable. The board's negligence could cost the association members in legal 
fees or loss of value of their real property. 
</P>
<P>
 You have indicated that your letters requesting financial statements have been 
ignored. Have you contacted each board member? Does the association have a 
management company that might respond to your written request? Will the other 
owners join with you to pressure the board to fulfill their fiduciary duties?  
</P>
<P>
 If none of these alternatives is successful, seek the advice of an attorney 
who is well-versed in community association law. Budget Information Must Be 
Supplied 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I live in a stock cooperative. Our fiscal year will end Dec. 31. Are the 
stockholders entitled to budget information if the monthly assessment is going 
to increase next year?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes, the California law that governs common-interest developments or 
community associations, Civil Code Sections 1350 through 1373, pertains to 
stock cooperatives and community apartment projects ("own your own" apartment 
complexes) as well as condominiums, homeowner associations and planned unit 
developments (PUDs). All community associations, large or small and 
incorporated or unincorporated, are governed by these sections of the Civil 
Code. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual budget, including the estimated expenses of both the operating fund 
and reserve funds, must be distributed to all owners between 45 and 60 days 
prior to the beginning of the fiscal year. The distribution of the annual 
budget is required even if the amount of the budget does not change. 
</P>
<P>
 Other disclosure requirements, which include the notice of the community 
association's delinquency procedures for unpaid assessments, the association's 
schedule of monetary penalties for violation of the governing documents and the 
summary of Civil Code Section 1354, can be distributed in the same mailing. Is 
Association Liable for Handyman Injury? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Our association employs a handyman who is probably an illegal immigrant 
without a green card. He is paid $7 per hour in cash at the end of each week. 
He sometimes pays his friends a small amount out of his own salary when he 
needs help. 
</P>
<P>
 If the handyman or his helper is injured while working for the association, 
could the association be required to pay the medical bills? The board president 
says that the worker is an independent contractor and, therefore, the 
association is not responsible. I cannot convince the other board members that 
we have any liability. What can you tell us? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The cheap labor that you are using could end up with a high price tag. Your 
association is violating a number of laws in addition to immigration law. 
First, it is doubtful that the worker would qualify as an independent 
contractor. Therefore, the association is responsible for payroll taxes, 
worker's compensation, OSHA regulations and other employer requirements. If a 
complaint is filed, the association could be charged with heavy penalties for 
ignoring these laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members who ignore the law are not serving the best interests of the 
owners. Though I am not in favor of board recall in most situations, I 
recommend board recall in this case if the board refuses to obey the law. The 
owners should petition for a recall vote as soon as possible. It will take some 
effort on your part to get the support of the other owners and make the board 
recall successful. 
</P>

HOT PROPERTY: JOCKEY WILL PULL UP STAKES

 Jockey COREY NAKATANI, who is on the verge of becoming one of the country's 
leading riders, and his wife, Michelle, have put their Monrovia home on the 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are looking for horse property, though they plan to keep their horses at 
the Flintridge Riding Club, and they want a larger house, probably in La 
Canada," said listing agent Jeannie Garr-Roddy, daughter of longtime 
horse-racing radio personality Bill Garr. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakatani, who just turned 24 and began riding professionally less than six 
years ago, is riding today in the Japan Cup, a $4-million purse race. Nakatani 
scored his first stakes victory in 1989 aboard Defend Your Man. He won his 
first riding title at the recent Del Mar meeting, and he also led all riders in 
the Oak Tree meet at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 Making his success even sweeter is the fact that Santa Anita was the site 
during World War II of a relocation camp where Nakatani's father, Roy, and 
grandparents were incarcerated with hundreds of other Japanese-Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Nakatani was born in a Colorado relocation camp, and he and his parents 
were transferred to the Santa Anita center. 
</P>
<P>
 Corey Nakatani is a native of Covina. He and his wife, daughter of 
thoroughbred trainer Wally Dollase, have three children. 
</P>
<P>
 Their home has four bedrooms and a guest house. It's in an area known as upper 
Monrovia, which is in the foothills of the San Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The home, which the Nakatanis bought newly built in 1991, has mountain views 
and is on a bit more than half an acre, zoned for two horses. There are two 
corrals and a horse shed on the property, which also has access to a riding 
trail. 
</P>
<P>
 Garr-Roddy has the $645,000 listing at the William Wilson Co. in Pasadena. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Singer/songwriter JODY WATLEY and her former husband, producer ANDRE ANDERSON, 
have sold their Los Feliz home to producer P.K. Simonds and his wife, actress 
Beth Colt. 
</P>
<P>
 Simonds is a co-producer with Steven Spielberg's Amblin Television of the 
sci-fi TV series "Earth 2." 
</P>
<P>
 The home, which was listed at $829,000, sold for $660,000, according to public 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1926, the two-story Mediterranean has city views from nearly every 
room. There are four bedrooms in the nearly 4,000-square-foot home. 
</P>
<P>
 Patti Arcuri of Fred Sands Realtors, Santa Monica, represented the buyers. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Beach home of the late actor STERLING HOLLOWAY, who appeared as the 
quintessential country bumpkin in a series of films and was the voice for 
several of Walt Disney's characters, including Winnie the Pooh, is on the 
market at $975,000. It was originally listed at $1,175,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Holloway died of heart failure at age 87 in 1992. His collection of 
contemporary art was donated to UCLA. His house was left to his adopted son. 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1963 as a retreat for the actor and a private gallery for his art, 
the house was once described as "one with his collection. Entirely white inside 
and out, it is an intricate arrangement of rectangular spaces, large and small, 
delimited by panes of glass overlooking the ocean." The secluded, hillside 
house is reached at the end of a 200-foot private drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The house, which can be expanded, has one bedroom in slightly more than 1,800 
square feet. "Mr. Holloway didn't want guests," said Robert Bryson, who shares 
the listing with Clark Smith, both of Realatrends, Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The home is in the community of Three Arch Bay, which has a 24-hour gate 
guard, private beach and tennis courts. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Two basketball stars -- guards HAROLD MINER of the Miami Heat and GERALD 
MADKINS of the Cleveland Cavaliers -- have purchased homes in the West Los 
Angeles community of Ladera Heights Estates. 
</P>
<P>
 Madkins, a former UCLA player, and his wife, Julee, bought the same floor plan 
as Miner, a former USC star. 
</P>
<P>
 Miner purchased the home mainly for his mother. "But he will stay there when 
he's in town," a source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the houses, in a Lewis Homes hillside development, has four bedrooms, 
a library, circular staircase and upstairs game room in slightly more than 
3,300 square feet. They each sold for about $545,000, a source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Madkins and his wife will maintain their primary residence in Ohio. 
</P>
<P>

 CLARIFICATION: The "Hot Property" item about Genie Francis and Jonathan Frakes 
buying a house in the Beverly Hills area (Nov. 6) omitted Richard Klug of 
Douglas Properties, Beverly Hills, as co-listing agent with Larry Bovshow of

YOUR MORTGAGE; TIPS FOR HOME-BUYING CAREER CHANGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLEN JAMES MARTIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Are you one of the many Americans who foresee both a career change and a home 
purchase in the near future? 
</P>
<P>
 Then good timing on your part could be imperative if you are to obtain a 
mortgage, home finance experts emphasize. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lenders like stability. They don't like change," said Sidney Lenz, an 
executive vice president for Countrywide Funding Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're on the verge of a major career transition, it can make a lot of 
sense to buy the home before you do the work move, according to the experts. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because a job change always casts doubt in a lender's mind about a 
mortgage applicant's future earning potential. This is particularly true if the 
change is a major shift. 
</P>
<P>
 Lenders' eyebrows rise least when they learn that a loan applicant has 
recently moved from one salaried position to another similar, or better, 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 But they frighten easily when they learn that a potential borrower has 
recently made a change in fields, moved into a commissioned sales position or 
gone self-employed. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, many mortgage lenders routinely reject loan applications that are 
based on the income of self-employed people who have been on their own for less 
than two years, said Lenz, author of "Your Money and Your Home," a paperback 
book put out by Griffin Publishing. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll need a track record for your new business before you apply for a 
mortgage," Lenz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there are exceptions to the usual rules of mortgage lending. Most 
lenders operate under general "guidelines" established by the investors who 
will one day own the loans they make. And those guidelines are hardly cast in 
concrete. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it can be very tough to talk a lender into making you a mortgage if 
you've just left a 10-year-career as a schoolteacher and now intend to 
establish your own printing company. 
</P>
<P>
 Even moving from one salaried position in the teaching field to another in the 
printing industry could raise doubts in your lender's mind about your ability 
to succeed in the future. That's because you have no proven track record in the 
printing field. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving from one commission-driven job to another can also be a problem -- even 
if you're staying within the same field. That's because employers in commission 
areas have less to lose if a person they engage fails to perform than does the 
employer who screens applicants for a salaried job. 
</P>
<P>
 You may have been highly successful selling Hondas for 10 years and may simply 
have moved to position selling Chevrolets. But unless you can show that the 
commission plan offered by both companies is roughly the same, your lender will 
worry that your income may slump at the new dealership, said Lenz of 
Countrywide. 
</P>
<P>
 Your best prospects for obtaining a mortgage in the immediate aftermath of a 
job change involve a switch from one salaried position to another such job in 
the same field. Your lender may not even blink when you tell him you've just 
gone from a nursing position at Hospital A to another at Hospital B -- even if 
the job change takes you across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 But for most career-changers seeking to safeguard their chances of financing a 
home, caution is the key. Here are five pointers from the experts: 
</P>
<P>
 -- No. 1: Get a lender's general reading on your potential career change 
before you make your career move. 
</P>
<P>
 You don't have to wait until you have a home picked out to telephone a lender. 
These days, many lenders willingly offer free counseling to would-be borrowers 
in advance of housing selection. 
</P>
<P>
 Are you hoping one day soon to purchase a big white Victorian house on the far 
side of your current community? At the same time, are you hoping to leave the 
life insurance industry and go into the car insurance field? 
</P>
<P>
 Then ask your local lender how such a switch could have an impact on your 
prospects for obtaining a home loan. The answer could shape your timetable -- 
assuming your career change is a voluntary one. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No. 2: Select a lender for your actual purchase who is flexible in 
interpreting the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Suppose you've already made the switch from life insurance to car insurance 
sales. And suppose you've already put a contract on the big white Victorian 
house you want to finance. Now is the time to cautiously set about locating a 
lender who will be sympathetic to your situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Many mortgage companies now offer "pre-approval" programs to tell you whether 
you qualify for one of their loans. This is an excellent way to get an early 
sense of whether the job change you've already made will disqualify you in the 
eyes of one lender before it's too late to move on to another. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No. 3: Be honest about the facts of your career past and present. 
</P>
<P>
 Both ethics and practicality dictate that you come clean with your lender 
about your job history and present employment status. If you've been unemployed 
in the recent past, it's far better that the lender hear this from you rather 
than discover the fact from another source. 
</P>
<P>
 By the same token, it would be foolhardy not to disclose that you've already 
accepted a new job and will be making the switch during the mortgage 
application period. The reality is that your lender will probably find this out 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No. 4: Don't disclose career plans that have yet to unfold. 
</P>
<P>
 A mortgage applicant is under no obligation to reveal future career 
intentions. Doing so could undermine his chances of getting a mortgage, says 
Lenz of Countrywide Funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mortgage lending is based on your situation today and in the past -- not on 
the future," Lenz pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, if you blurt out your intentions to switch careers in the near 
future, the lender is obligated to take these disclosures into account. 
</P>
<P>
 -- No. 5: Make sure you're comfortable that your career and housing plans are 
financially compatible. 
</P>
<P>
 It's one thing to convince a lender that you're a good risk to take on a 
mortgage obligation. It's another thing to know -- in your soul -- that you 
won't be at risk of default. 
</P>
<P>
 Are you planning to leave your government job and go into the consulting 
business after you've bought the big white Victorian? 
</P>
<P>
 Then you'd better give serious thought to how you'll meet your mortgage 
payments in the early -- and usually lean -- years of your entrepreneurial 
life, said Davey of Draper & Kramer. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're the lender, the loan is just a statistic. But if you're the 
borrower, it's your life," Davey said.

By Special to the Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 These days, it seems cows are as popular in urban homes as they are on farms 
and ranches. Decorating with cow themes remains as trendy as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a do-it-yourself project that will add a little of that bovine charm to 
your home or yard. This cow planter can be used indoors or out: just fill it up 
with potted plants or flowers and put it on the porch, in the yard or in the 
kitchen or den. 
</P>
<P>
 The completed cow planter measures 37 inches long by 14 inches wide by 21 
inches high. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cow Planter plan, No. 825, is $6.50 and includes step-by-step directions 
with 15 photos, full-size traceable patterns, exploded diagrams and a shopping 
list and cutting schedule.

TRAVEL INSIDER: AVOIDING AN ODD COUPLE ODYSSEY WITH FRIENDS; VACATIONS: BEFORE 
PLANNING A TRIP WITH YOUR BEST BUDDIES, KNOW THEIR QUIRKY HABITS AND SPENDING 
AND SLEEPING PATTERNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES T. YENCKEL, WASHINGTON POST 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Few things are as critical to successful travel as good companions. You may 
not have the option of leaving behind a grumpy spouse, but when you can pick 
someone to accompany you on vacation, choose with care. Even best friends may 
make the worst of travel companions. 
</P>
<P>
 A vacation, remember, is not the same as having dinner with the neighbors. Odd 
personality quirks that can be tolerated for a few hours can loom large when 
you're together for days or weeks under stressful circumstances -- and minor 
differences of opinion can fester into grievances. 
</P>
<P>
 Once you have found compatible traveling partners, you don't want to lose 
them. I've run into people who travel together regularly because their 
interests and habits blend, but who go their separate ways at home. On the 
other hand, my wife and I are very close friends with a couple with whom we 
never would travel for more than a day or so. It would kill our friendship.  
</P>
<P>
 Probably anybody who has traveled much has a tale of mismatched companions. 
</P>
<P>
 Years ago my wife and I, who are frequent travelers, invited a couple from her 
hometown to join us for a couple of weeks in Europe. We were the experts who 
would introduce the first-time visitors to a part of the world we like very 
much. Unknown to us, the husband was the enthusiast pushing for the trip; his 
wife agreed to come along reluctantly. She thought the cost of the trip could 
be better spent on furnishing their house. And so, amid the splendor of the 
Swiss Alps and the whimsy of Copenhagen's Tivoli Gardens, they quarreled again 
and again.  
</P>
<P>
 My wife and I share a delight for exotic foods, and eating as an adventure is 
a significant part of a trip for us. So if we travel with others, we want them 
to like unusual menu choices too.  
</P>
<P>
 Good, well-chosen companions can add zest to a holiday. And I say this as 
someone who, over the years, has become quite comfortable traveling alone, as I 
often do. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, my wife and I took another first-timer to Italy for two weeks -- 
my wife's sister, in fact. As we all recognize, there is something obligatory 
about traveling with family members -- you can't say no easily. I had no 
intention of saying no in this case, and as it turned out my sister-in-law, 
Pam, proved to be a very good companion.  
</P>
<P>
 The three of us explored Northern Italy by train for two weeks, which meant we 
spent a lot of time in railway stations buying tickets in a language none of us 
speaks. Rather than let my wife and I, the old-timers, assume such everyday 
travel chores as ticket buying, Pam pitched in to help. And she did so eagerly 
and without prompting, as a way of getting more involved in Italy.  
</P>
<P>
 Based on experiences both good and bad, I've compiled a list of qualities to 
look for in traveling companions -- that is, outsiders with whom you agree to 
travel. Look for someone who: 
</P>
<P>
 * Expects to spend about as much or as little as you do on the vacation. 
Budgetary differences can quickly erupt into bitter arguments. Decide which you 
will do or agree to compromise 50-50 before you leave home, or don't travel 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 * Knows and tolerates your personal habits, and whose foibles you are 
comfortable with. I am an early riser every day of the week.My wife isn't. So 
we have worked out a compromise:I run, walk or swim at dawn, and she arises in 
time to allow us a full day of vacation activities.  
</P>
<P>
 * Shares your idea of fun. I travel to learn, which is how I have fun. A day 
spent idling on a beach is my idea of torture. If I were looking for a travel 
companion to the Caribbean, for example, it would have to be someone who 
realized I would spend much of my time exploring back roads and remote 
villages.  
</P>
<P>
 * Enjoys the same tastes in food. I once traveled in Europe with a guy who 
figured cheapest was best. He carried a guide to budget eateries and refused to 
dine elsewhere. Once his book steered us to a place that can only be described 
as a tourist feeding trough. Every 30 minutes, a new group of young American 
vagabonds -- us among them -- was seated at communal tables. I stood as much of 
this as I could and then started eating better on my own. 
</P>
<P>
 * Matches you in stamina. My wife and I like to walk, so we spend lots of time 
exploring cities in this country and abroad on foot. In Paris a few years ago, 
we met up with an old friend for several days. Invariably, she wanted to get to 
museums and other attractions using the Metro. We preferred to walk, arguing 
that there is a lot to see along the way. Ultimately we agreed to walk one way 
and ride the other. 
</P>
<P>
 * Is as adventurous or cautious as you. Once an old friend told me, "I like it 
when you are along because you're always willing to do things." I took this as 
quite a compliment.  
</P>
<P>
 * Can manage quite nicely on their own, when circumstances require.  
</P>
<P>
 * Doesn't leave the dirty work to you. Let my sister-in-law Pam be the guide 
here. As much as my wife and I enjoy plotting our own sightseeing itineraries, 
it proved a relief to have Pam take her turn as the instigator of activities. 
When she was in charge, she led us to places that interested her but that we 
might have skipped -- and vice versa. Everybody learned something more than 
they might have, which is what you hope for from good companions. 
</P>
<P>

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS: EAGLE-EYED IN SANTA BARBARA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Birders who want to add American bald eagles, Canada geese, snow geese and 
tundra swans to their sighting lists may want to head to Cachuma Lake, midway 
between Santa Barbara and Solvang, where there's a new tour boat (pictured at 
right) offering eagle-viewing cruises. 
</P>
<P>
 The 43-foot Osprey, operated by the Santa Barbara County Park Department, 
offers two-hour, naturalist-led Eagle Cruises from Wednesday through 
Sunday.Tickets cost $10 for adults and $5 for children under 12. Reservations 
are recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 In winter months, hundreds of bald eagles migrate from Northern California, 
Oregon, western Canada and Alaska, seeking the warmer climates and more 
abundant food sources of southern regions. Often they follow migrations of 
water fowl to inland lakes like Cachuma where food is plentiful and the impact 
of human development is minimal.  
</P>
<P>
 The naturalists at Cachuma Lake aim to keep it that way: the Osprey stays at 
least 200 yards from eagle roosting sites and naturalists suggest that 
photographers bring fast film, long lenses and tripods. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 275 species of birds have been identified at Lake Cachuma, which is 
also home to many large animals. For information and reservations, call (805) 
568-2460.

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS: A TAXING MATTER IN BRITAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Britain-bound? Be prepared to tack on another $16 or so for a new departure 
tax at British airports.Passengers traveling within Britain and to European 
Union countries (as well as Austria, Finland and Norway) pay about $8; for all 
other destinations, including the United States, the tax is about $16. 
(Transfers don't pay, and those on round trips to and from the same airport 
within Britain pay only once.) The tax is added to air fares -- so at least you 
don't have to fork over the 10 pounds at the airport as you're leaving.

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS: FACE-LIFT FOR A GRANDE DAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The celebrated Peninsula Hotel in Hong Kong, perennially at or near the top of 
everyone's "best" lists, has undergone a face-lift and added a sleek new wing 
that it formally inaugurates Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The $180-million, 30-story addition -- designed by Hong Kong architect Rocco 
Yim -- is chock-full of the latest in high-tech gear, such as audio and video 
equipment, silent facsimile machines, two-line telephones and computer jacks, 
but hotel spokesmen hasten to assure that the familiar main lobby, front facade 
and forecourt have all been retained.Afternoon tea, a must for many visitors, 
is still served in the lobby. However, those in the market for something new 
may want to venture to the top of the 132-room tower where noted restaurant 
designer Philippe Starck has created Felix, Hong Kong's sky-high hot spot. The 
grande dame of Hong Kong hotels first opened its doors in 1928, and since then 
has projected a nostalgic, elegant, colonial style. All manner of royalty and 
presidents, business moguls and film stars have slept there. You can too; 
doubles start at $335. AMANDA STINCHECUM

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS: ONE-STOP SHOPPING FOR B&B STAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 B&B fans can now get information and make reservations at more than 5,000 U.S. 
and overseas bed and breakfasts from a new fax-on-demand service. 
</P>
<P>
 B&B/Innfo Fax is operated by Bed & Breakfast Reservations Services World-Wide 
Inc. of Baton Rouge, La., a 9-year-old trade association representing 32 
reservation agencies in 22 states and Europe, Russia, Canada, Mexico, Costa 
Rica, Australia and New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers can get a list of participating reservation services by calling 
(800) 364-7242. Once they have the list, they contact agencies in the 
destination of their choice and make reservations for as many locations as they 
want. 
</P>
<P>
 Each reservation service sends information on reservation and cancellation 
policies, deposit requirements and a sampling of the inns and B&Bs it 
represents. All properties have been inspected to ensure they meet association 
standards for comfort, convenience, security and hospitality, a spokeswoman 
said. Information is updated quarterly, she said. Faxes are sent within 15 
minutes and cost from $3.95 to $7.95 per destination. Consumers must have a 
MasterCard or Visa.

HIKING: NORTHERN CALIFORNIA: PLAY, PLAY, PLAY ON LAKE OROVILLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Boating, water-skiing, fishing and swimming are popular forms of recreation on 
Feather River-fed Lake Oroville, while camping, picnicking, hiking and 
horseback riding keep Oroville's lengthy (167 mile) shoreline active. 
</P>
<P>
 The lake, about 75 miles north of Sacramento, was created by 
higher-than-Hoover Oroville Dam in 1967. While it provides many thousands of 
Californians with a place to play, its main purpose is to hold water for 
distribution to the San Joaquin Valley, San Francisco and the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 To learn about the lake and surrounding environs, check out the displays and 
observation tower at the visitor center. Here you'll find exhibits about 
Western water-seekers, California's gigantic water system and the role of water 
today. From Lake Oroville's visitor information center, you can join the 
Chaparral Trail (an interpretive nature trail) and then follow the Kelly Ridge 
Trail to a lookout point above the lake; this lots-to-see loop is 2 3/4 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the park, in Plumas National Forest, is the Feather Falls Trail (7 1/2 
miles round trip) which leads to a most impressive waterfall. The 640-foot high 
waterfall is the sixth highest in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The state recreation area has a couple of short hiking trails that can be 
linked to provide a two-mile jaunt or a more ambitious 4 3/4-mile loop. 
</P>
<P>
 Directions to trail head: From California 70 (Business), otherwise known as 
Oroville Dam Boulevard in Oroville, head east to California 162 (Olive Highway) 
and continue five miles to Kelly Ridge Road. Turn left and drive a half-mile. 
Just after the turnoff to the water treatment plant, turn right on the dirt 
road leading to a parking area. 
</P>
<P>
 The hike: Head back toward the water treatment plant and small dam. Ignore the 
signed trail beckoning you to hike to the visitor information center, and walk 
across the dam to the signed trail head on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the "Brooks Orchard" leg of the loop trail and begin a modest climb 
through a woodland of oak and digger pine. 
</P>
<P>
 After a mile, the trail forks. A left means you loop back another mile to the 
trail head. The right fork crosses the Loafer Creek Campground Road, then 
gently travels a mile to Brooks Orchard, a popular resting and watering place 
for the many horses and riders on Oroville's trails. 
</P>
<P>
 A quarter-mile past this rest stop, you'll cross a creek, then meander down 
toward the lake shore. You'll skirt Loafer Creek Campground, then ascend oak- 
and ponderosa pine-covered slopes. 
</P>
<P>
 When you meet up with Loafer Creek Loop Trail, you'll swing right, hiking over 
grass slopes on a mellow descent back to the trail head. Loafer Creek, Roy 
Rogers Trails 
</P>
<P>
 WHERE: Lake Oroville State Recreation Area north of Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 DISTANCE: 2-mile loop or 4-mile loop. 
</P>
<P>
 TERRAIN: Chaparral-oak-pine dotted hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
 HIGHLIGHTS: Intimate view of lake and monument to state water system. 
</P>
<P>
 DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY: Easy to moderate. 
</P>
<P>

TRAVEL ADVISORY: THAILAND IMPRISONS DRUG OFFENDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWARD WRIGHT, Wright is a former assistant foreign editor at The Times. His 
column appears monthly.

<P>
 Asia 
</P>
<P>
 Thailand: Fifty-five Americans are being held in Thailand on drug charges, the 
U.S. government reports. Of the 31 women and 24 men, one has been sentenced to 
death and 17 are serving life sentences. According to the State Department, 
many of these were gullible individuals who carried the drugs for others, 
having been lured by offers of free vacations or lucrative payoffs. Some were 
reportedly unaware that drugs were hidden in their luggage. The State 
Department notes that prison conditions in Thailand are extremely harsh, and 
that Thai officials frequently do not notify the U.S. Embassy of the arrest of 
Americans for minor drug offenses. Nor are Americans the only foreigners 
affected: The Reuters news agency reports that a court in Bangkok sentenced a 
British woman to life imprisonment for heroin trafficking, and that more than 
30 Britons are serving drug-related sentences in the Southeast Asian nation. 
South America 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil: Faced with growing lawlessness in Brazil's most visible city, the 
state governor of Rio de Janeiro bowed to the urgings of President Itamar 
Franco early this month and allowed the army to take control of state and local 
law enforcement. The army will coordinate the fight against bandits and drug 
traffickers who have chased businesses and tourists out of Rio. More than 23 
people a day are murdered in the city of 10 million, which has one of the 
world's highest murder rates, twice that of Los Angeles. Rio's tourism revenue 
has dropped $800 million a year since 1988. Ten days after the army 
mobilization, Times correspondent Ron Harris reported that Rio's drug 
traffickers were lying low and bandits were disappearing from the streets. 
Russia 
</P>
<P>
 Although Washington has somewhat softened its harsh assessment of Russian air 
safety, two accidents have raised new concerns. The two Oct. 29 crashes in 
Siberia killed at least 26 people and raised the death toll so far this year to 
at least 287. In July, the State Department had warned of the hazards of 
Russian flights since the breakup of Aeroflot into about 320 newly privatized 
national and regional airlines, or "Baby-flots." But on Oct. 14, the U.S. 
Embassy in Moscow said a review by U.S. and Russian experts had given Russia 
"minimally passing marks" for air safety. U.S. government employees were given 
permission to travel on any Russian airline that is certified to operate 
internationally. Times correspondent Sonni Efron in Moscow quoted Russian 
officials as saying the two airlines involved in the latest crashes, Yakutavia 
and Aeronika, lacked such certification. Briefly . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Cambodia: After the murders of three Western hostages by Khmer Rouge 
guerrillas, Cambodia's King Norodom Sihanouk warned tourists to avoid his 
country, Reuters reported. The three -- a Briton, a Frenchman and an Australian 
-- had been captured July 26. The Khmer Rouge also warned Westerners to stay 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 Guatemala: An increase in bus fares touched off demonstrations and rioting in 
Guatemala City that left one person dead and 32 injured, Reuters said. Troops 
were called out after students, street gangs, trade unionists and passengers 
joined forces to stone buses and attack riot police. 
</P>
<P>
 India: Police freed a Bay Area resident and three Britons who were held 
hostage by Kashmiri separatists. Times correspondent John-Thor Dahlburg said 
the kidnaping of the four foreigners in New Delhi could further damage India's 
travel industry, already reeling from an outbreak of plague. 
</P>
<P>
 Hot Spots: The State Department has dropped Haiti and Lesotho from its list of 
places where Americans are advised not to travel. And, citing an attempted coup 
and unsettled conditions, it has added the West African nation of Gambia. 
Travel warnings are also in effect for Afghanistan, Algeria, Angola, 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Burundi, Colombia, Guatemala, Iran, Iraq, Lebanon, Liberia, 
Libya, North Korea, Peru, Rwanda, Serbia and Montenegro, Somalia, Sudan and 
Tajikistan.

MORE HORRORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After reading "The Apple's Revenge" ("Travel Horrors," Oct. 30), I can tell 
you the same thing happened to us right here in Beverly Hills. On the way in 
for a weekend stay, we stopped for lunch, and when we arrived at the hotel a 
few blocks away, the bellman observed an empty car trunk -- gone were all of 
our night wear and formal clothing, as well as the gift for the celebration we 
were to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 The Beverly Hills Police should know us well. Last year, we reported to them a 
hit-and-run driver who sideswiped our new car. So let's stop tearing at New 
York City. We love the Big Apple and we go there for the best theater, opera, 
ballet, concerts, museums, food and excitement -- not the kind that needs to be 
reported to the police!

</P>
<P>
 My sympathies to Jon and Marissa Thurber; I can relate to their plight quite 
well ("Paradise Lost"). My wife, my daughter, her fiance and I were in Honolulu 
about the same time and we were holed up for the last 2 1/2 days of the storm. 
It rained 11 inches near Hanauma Bay in 24 hours.  
</P>
<P>
 We tried our best one day to sightsee. But, after a very wet lunch, we went 
back to the hotel. We barely made it back when they closed the Like Like 
Highway, due to flooding. The fourth day was finally clear and we made our way 
to the beach, only to find 2 or 3 million of our closest friends. 
</P>
<P>
 It's too bad the Thurbers couldn't have stayed longer because the next four 
days were picture perfect.

BASTILLE BRAVO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thank you so much for your article on the Bastille District ("Cafe Cool," 
Sept. 4). My new bride and I honeymooned in Paris in October.We walked several 
miles and stopped at about 10 hotels on the Left Bank only to find the entire 
town was full due to a fashion convention. We weren't far from the area you 
described, so we gave it a try. It only took us two stops to find a very clean 
room with a bath at the Hotel Pax (12, rue de Charonnes, 75011 Paris), for $45 
a night. The proprietress was very pleasant and she also spoke a little 
English. We were just doors away from the "restaurant street" you described, La 
Rue de Lappe. We went to the Bistrot Les Sans Culotte and were delighted. We 
ate there three nights in a row because the food was excellent, the wine list 
extensive and the staff very efficient.

 Calendar's pop staff surveys 40 of the nation's most popular or critically 
acclaimed albums : 
</P>
<P>
 ** 1/2 BROOKS & DUNN, "Waitin' on Sundown," Arista.The country duo avoids 
repeating past successes. That doesn't mean singles-by-the-numbers have 
disappeared, but nearly half the songs dig a little deeper. 
</P>
<P>
 ** ALAN JACKSON, "Who I Am," Arista. Jackson doesn't wrestle with demons; he 
just tips his Stetson politely and moseys on his way. Only occasionally does he 
reach beyond the superficial. 
</P>
<P>
 Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three stars 
(good, recommended) and four stars (excellent). A rating of five stars is 
reserved for reissues or retrospectives. Randy Lewis

 Calendar's pop staff surveys 40 of the nation's most popular or critically 
acclaimed albums : 
</P>
<P>
 *** MARY CHAPIN CARPENTER, "Stones in the Road," Columbia. Remarkable 
word-craft, but you might wish that the melodies had the rapture or rhapsody to 
put the words across for all they're worth. 
</P>
<P>
 ** 1/2 MADONNA, "Bedtime Stories," Sire. The soft Madonna is back. The least 
remarkable of all her albums but not necessarily the least of them, it has a 
nice, consistently relaxed feel and strings of non-ironic cliches. 
</P>
<P>
 **** JONI MITCHELL, "Turbulent Indigo," Reprise. Mitchell has written some of 
her most subtly beautiful melodies in ages in the service of testy miniatures 
about abuse, injustice, hypocrisy and loneliness. 
</P>
<P>
 *** TOM PETTY, "Wildflowers," Warner Bros. His third straight album in a more 
stark and somber mode. Inconsistent, and without any songs that rank with his 
greatest, but his mixture has an interesting, subtle resonance.  
</P>
<P>
 *** 1/2 BARBRA STREISAND, "The Concert," Columbia. Her unsurpassed voice says 
everything it needs to about Streisand, and plenty about the way we were in the 
last gasps of Broadway's golden hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three stars 
(good, recommended) and four stars (excellent). A rating of five stars is 
reserved for reissues or retrospectives. Chris Willman

 Calendar's pop staff surveys 40 of the nation's most popular or critically 
acclaimed albums : 
</P>
<P>
 *** ANITA BAKER, "Rhythm of Love," Elektra. This side of Sade, no woman in pop 
music has a more sensual sound.While not as instantly irresistible as 
"Rapture," "Rhythm's" sultry charms grow on you. 
</P>
<P>
 ** BRANDY, "Brandy," Atlantic. The teen-age newcomer imbues the hit "I Wanna 
Be Down" with self-assured authority, but elsewhere she's saddled with drab, 
sub-par songs. 
</P>
<P>
 * BARRY WHITE, "The Icon Is Love," A&M. Never known for his prim ways, White 
really spells out his intentions on this randy roundup of bedroom ballads. But 
so much emphasis on mattress-bouncing can carry you only so far. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 *** BLACK CROWES, "Amorica," American.Still standing proud in their 
flare-bottoms, the Crowes offer dated fashions, snotty poses and an engaging, 
exhilarating celebration of the rock 'n' roll groove. 
</P>
<P>
 *** 1/2 JIMMY PAGE & ROBERT PLANT, "No Quarter," Atlantic. The diversity of 
the players here encourages Page and Plant to vigorously reinvent several of 
their Led Zeppelin classics. 
</P>

 Calendar's pop staff surveys 40 of the nation's most popular or critically

</P>
<P>
 ** BONE THUGS-N-HARMONY, "Creepin On Ah Come Up," Ruthless/Relativity. The 
Clevelanders emulate Spice-1's hard-core rap stylings quite capably, and they 
come up with the first successful fusion of gospel and hard-core. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1/2 BOYZ II MEN, "II," Motown. The credits read like a Who's Who of R&B 
songwriters and producers, but the album consists of limp ballads with 
unchallenging lyrics.  
</P>
<P>
 *** SCARFACE, "The Diary," Rap-A Lot/Noo Trybe/Virgin. An aural journey 
through a hard mind flooded with thoughts of funerals, tears, drugs and 
confusion. Unapologetically true to the origins of gangsta rap. 
</P>

 *** 1/2 ERIC CLAPTON, "From the Cradle," Duck/Reprise.Clapton is simply too 
comfortable, too alive within the electric blues medium, for anyone to mistake 
this for a mere visit for sentimental reasons.

 Calendar's pop staff surveys 40 of the nation's most popular or critically 
acclaimed albums : 
</P>
<P>
 ** THE CRANBERRIES, "No Need to Argue," Island. The Irish band sheds youthful 
innocence in favor of weightier themes, but the lyrics are mostly obvious and 
the production touches have become largely anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 **** NINE INCH NAILS, "The Downward Spiral," Nothing/TVT/Interscope. Combining 
seductive songwriting craft, gear-grinding industrial howl and raw, unsettling 
language, Trent Reznor leads us on a nightmarish journey through an emptiness 
of the modern spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 *** NIRVANA, "MTV Unplugged in New York," Geffen. The stripped-down setting 
offers a valuable glimpse into the soul of an artist, but Nirvana's studio 
collections remain the essential expressions of Kurt Cobain's art. 
</P>
<P>
 *** OFFSPRING, "Smash," Epitaph. In a remarkable small-label success story, 
this Orange County band brings a winning enthusiasm and conviction to tales of 
youthful concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 **** PEARL JAM, "Vitalogy," Epic. A major advance over the group's first two 
albums -- the playing is spontaneous and fresh, Eddie Vedder demonstrates equal 
growth as a writer, and there is a triumphant sense of daring.  
</P>
<P>
 **** R.E.M., "Monster," Warner Bros. A spirited celebration of rock history 
and imagination, with a rock assault as radical as U2's "Achtung Baby." 
</P>
<P>
 *** ROLLING STONES, "Voodoo Lounge," Virgin. Nothing here is likely to give 
the lasting emotional rush as their definitive recordings, but the band sounds 
more comfortable than it has in years. 
</P>
<P>
 *** THE TRACTORS, "The Tractors," Arista. One of the surprise finds of the 
year in country music -- workingman's blues influenced by everyone from Bob 
Wills to Chuck Berry, Elvis Presley to Woody Guthrie. 
</P>
<P>
 **** NEIL YOUNG & CRAZY HORSE, "Sleeps With Angels," Reprise. This is music 
about social concerns and private thoughts that is as soul-baring as anything 
the singer-songwriter has done since 1975's "Tonight's the Night." 
</P>
<P>
 *** THE EAGLES, "Hell Freezes Over," Geffen. Of the four new studio tracks in 
this otherwise live collection, the best is "Learn to Be Still," which carries 
much of the soft, philosophical resonance of "The Last Resort." 
</P>
<P>
 Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three stars 
(good, recommended) and four stars (excellent). A rating of five stars is 
reserved for reissues or retrospectives. Robert Hilburn

</P>
<P>
 ** CRISTIAN, "El camino del alma," Fonovisa. Despite an eclectic mix of styles 
and big-time guests, the Mexican romantic sensation's third album offers 
nothing new. 
</P>
<P>
 *** LUIS MIGUEL, "Segundo Romance," WEA Latina. Updated, well-produced 
versions of classic romantic bolero and tango songs, this will easily please 
fans and convert newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 *** 1/2 CARLOS VIVES, "Clasicos de la Provincia," PolyGram Latino. The former 
soap opera star's pop version of classic vallenato, the folk music of the 
Colombian coast valleys, has rock and reggae touches to make the dead dance. 
</P>

 Calendar's pop staff surveys 40 of the nation's most popular or critically 
acclaimed albums : 
</P>
<P>
 *** SHERYL CROW, "Tuesday Night Music Club," A&M. This pop singer-songwriter 
sings with the seductive quirkiness of Rickie Lee Jones, and her 
country-influenced debut album is full of odbball gems. 
</P>
<P>
 *** 1/2 DIONNE FARRIS, "Wild Seed -- Wild Flower," Columbia. In an eclectic 
style encompassing folk, light funk, pop and gospel, the ex-Arrested 
Development member sings insightful songs with social and philosophical themes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 1/2 LUTHER VANDROSS, "Songs," Epic. Vandross covers a great list of mostly 
pop and R&B ballads and strikes out on almost all of them. He never alters his 
style or approaches the material in an innovative way. 
</P>
<P>
 *** VARIOUS ARTISTS, "Murder Was the Case," Death Row/Interscope. The three 
cuts on this soundtrack that feature Snoop Doggy Dogg are so-so; the 
hard-driving Dr. Dre-Ice Cube collaboration "Natural Born Killaz" is the best 
cut. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 **** HOLE, "Live Through This," Geffen.Courtney Love's incredibly sad lyrics 
reflect the turmoil in her life in an album that aims at all levels of the 
human psyche and rarely if ever misses its target. 
</P>
<P>
 **** LIZ PHAIR, "Whip-Smart," Matador. Her voice still hits those 
characteristically flat notes that make her real. This brilliant sophomore 
effort confirms Phair as a revolutionary force.

 The Cryptkeeper for Christmas?

<P>
 Yes, even the animatronic host of "Tales From the Crypt" has joined the ranks 
of celebs who can't keep their claws off holiday perennials, invading Como 
territory with an album of disemboweled ghoul-tide classics like "Deck the 
Halls With Parts of Charlie." 
</P>
<P>
 But really, another Christmas set from Neil Diamond -- now that's frightening. 
</P>
<P>
 This is proving to be far from the best year for Christmas albums, but not all 
the pop eggnog is stale. Some new notables: 
</P>
<P>
 *** BEN KEITH & FRIENDS, "Seven Gates," Reprise. The hep '94 Christmas album, 
hands-down, if only for a first-time duet between Neil Young and Johnny Cash -- 
on "The Little Drummer Boy"! Most tracks are tasty, rural-flavored 
instrumentals, headlined by Keith (one of Young's Stray Gators) on steel 
guitar. Neil pops up again singing "Greensleeves," and then there's forgetful 
Rusty Kershaw improvising lyrics for "Christmas Time's a-Comin'." 
</P>
<P>
 *** CHARLES BROWN, "Charles Brown's Cool Christmas Blues," Bullseye Blues. 
Smoother than rum 'n' eggnog, this veteran R&B-smith re-records his chestnuts 
-- "Merry Christmas Baby" and "Please Come Home for Christmas" -- with a small 
combo, adds fine new tunes and happily avoids standards not his own. 
</P>
<P>
 *** THE BENEDICTINE MONKS OF SANTO DOMINGO DE SILOS, "Chant Noel," Angel. A 
Benedictine "Jingle Bell Rock"? Not bloody likely. It's the label showing 
mercenary spirit here -- not the bros -- in capitalizing on "Chant"-mania by 
digging into the monk vaults for a new collection, few of whose chants have a 
solid Nativity connection. Still, better Easter tidings and non-seasonal psalms 
as stocking stuffers than most of what Xmas' pop secularists have to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 *** NATALIE COLE, "Holly and Ivy" Elektra. Is it any surprise a Cole would 
come up with one of the few recent traditional Christmas albums that isn't, uh, 
coal? The sound is big, brassy and old-fashioned -- not too fussily so. And of 
three full-on gospel versions of "Joy to the World" we've heard this year, 
Cole's is tops; sorry, Mariah and Aretha. 
</P>
<P>
 ** 1/2 GRAHAM PARKER, "Graham Parker's Christmas Cracker," Dakota Arts. Only 
three songs on this EP -- but they're new originals from the 
not-recently-prolific rocker (and the demo versions of all three are included 
as bonus tracks). Best is "Soul Christmas," a duet with Nona Hendryx that pays 
homage by name to just about every R&B singer who ever cut a Christmas single 
in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 ** 1/2 TRISHA YEARWOOD, "The Sweetest Gift," MCA. The pacing is schizoid -- 
what with "Reindeer Boogie" sandwiched foolishly between solemn Christ-child 
ballads -- but Yearwood gets decent returns from investing in some slightly 
less-trodden pop and country classics. 
</P>
<P>
 ** MARIAH CAREY, "Merry Christmas," Columbia. Is it good news or bad that 
Carey covers one of the great Christmas pop songs -- the Phil Spector-Darlene 
Love "Christmas (Baby Please Come Home)" -- and is completely faithful to the 
original? Could be worse. She at least attempts her share of girl-group pop 
amid the quasi-gospel melisma, though still not evidencing as much personality 
as talent in either style. 
</P>
<P>
 ** "TALES FROM THE CRYPT: HAVE YOURSELF A SCARY LITTLE CHRISTMAS," Right 
Stuff. The seasonal death and dismemberment within is hardly consistently 
amusing. But its preponderance of ill cheer is useful as an antidote, to be 
taken immediately after ingesting any of the following . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 1/2 DONNA SUMMER, "Christmas Spirit," Mercury. "Love to Love You, Baby 
Jesus"? We wish. Summer thoroughly eschews the upbeat in yet another highly 
generic, string-sweetened, all-ballad Christmas collection, destined to please 
neither fans nor a market already glutted with saccharine. 
</P>
<P>
 * KENNY G, "Miracles: The Holiday Album," Arista. "This album is a bit of a 
departure for me," Kenny announces in the liner notes. Yes, it's a little less 
hard-edged. America's favorite saxman employs one-man electronic backup instead 
of a real, live band on all but one track, ensuring that no one will mistake 
this for jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 * NEIL DIAMOND, "The Christmas Album Volume II," Columbia. Not quite as 
oversung and underfelt as the best-selling "Vol. I" of two years ago. But close 
enough. Once again, Diamond -- never best-regarded as a song interpreter -- 
couldn't be bothered to write a new tune, preferring to take on obvious 
standards with his inimitably heavy vocal hand. Rudolph: He's coming to 
America!  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The safest bets, not surprisingly, are some new repackages. Three terrific new 
Rhino releases span the genre gamut: "The Original Soul Christmas" puts 
early-'60s singles by Otis Redding, Carla Thomas, et al. back on a single 
album, with bonus tracks; "Jingle Bell Jam" compiles swell Christmas jazz from 
throughout the century, and "Have a Nice Day: Holiday Hits of the '70s," 
featuring Donny & Marie, Bobby Sherman, Liberace and more of their ilk, is so 
wonderfully perverse a collection you'd think it was Satan's birthday.*

BOX SET; ROOTS IN A BOX: EARLY ELVIS, R&B, COUNTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When Elvis Presley's career is recounted, the names of Sun Records 
owner-producer Sam Phillips and Presley's manager, Tom Parker, are inescapable. 
Phillips discovered Presley and Parker guaranteed his superstardom. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't forget Jim Hamill. 
</P>
<P>
 He's the gospel singer who turned down the teen-age Presley's bid to join his 
group the Songfellows. Disheartened, Presley then went over to Sun Records. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of that pivotal moment is contained in Charles Wolfe's liner notes 
for a new two-disc box set focusing on Presley's gospel side. The package is 
one of five sets that would make appealing holiday gifts for anyone interested 
in early rock or its roots. 
</P>
<P>
 *** "Elvis Presley -- Amazing Grace: His Greatest Sacred Performances," RCA 
(two discs). Casual fans beware: Despite stirring vocals, several of the songs 
in this 55-track collection are weak and the arrangements are sometimes 
careless. For the rock historian, however, the set is a must. Its highlights 
offer a look into Presley's musical instincts and the development of his ballad 
style. 
</P>
<P>
 ***** "The Sun Record Collection," Rhino (three discs). The Songfellows' loss 
was Sun Records' -- and rock 'n' roll's -- gain. But even without Presley's 
gems, Sun was the greatest of the early rock labels. Other Rock Hall of Fame 
members represented here: Howlin' Wolf, B. B. King, Jerry Lee Lewis, Roy 
Orbison, Ike Turner, Carl Perkins and Johnny Cash. This set is as close as we 
can get to hearing the birth of rock. 
</P>
<P>
 **** "The Specialty Story," Specialty (five discs). Art Rupe's Specialty 
Records ranks with Chess and Atlantic as the most important of the '50s R&B 
record companies -- a Los Angeles firm whose roster included Little Richard 
(represented by 19 tracks), Lloyd Price, Larry Williams, Percy Mayfield, Roy 
Milton and the Soul Stirrers with Sam Cooke. 
</P>
<P>
 **** "The R&B Box: 30 Years of Rhythm & Blues," Rhino (six discs). The Rhino 
team may have served us better by assembling smaller boxes, each devoted to 
specific R&B eras. This massive overview (Louis Jordan's "Five Guys Named Moe" 
to Ike & Tina's "Proud Mary") was bound to omit hits that some fans deem 
essential (such as the Crows' "Gee," one of the most important pop crossover 
hits of the mid-'50s) and include hits from one era that fans of another 
couldn't care less about. Still, it's a remarkable collection that captures the 
heartbeat of a great strain of American pop. 
</P>
<P>
 *** 1/2 "Honky Tonk Girl: The Loretta Lynn Collection," Decca (three discs). 
Jumping from R&B to rock 'n' roll's other main component. . . . Lynn's country 
stardom in the early '60s came too late to influence rock the way, say, Hank 
Williams' music did. But her singing and often wry material -- such as "Don't 
Come Home A'Drinkin' (With Lovin' on Your Mind)" -- captured marvelously the 
honky-tonk passion and blue-collar sentiment that were an integral part of 
country's pre-rock era.*

CHILDREN; OUR MAP FOR FINDING RECORDED TREASURES

 You can find a treasure-trove of out standing children's recordings out there 
-- if you know where to look. Major record retailers carry a limited selection; 
other sources are specialty stores and catalogues, toy stores and museum shops. 
Here's a sampling of recent top-notch recordings worth seeking out: 
</P>
<P>
 "Lullaby, a Collection" (Music for Little People/Warner Bros. Records) is a 
gentle, quiet musical caress. From Susan Robbins' hauntingly beautiful "Swedish 
Lullaby" and Ladysmith Black Mambazo's "Be Still My Child" to Bobby McFerrin's 
serene, soaring "Common Thread," these songs from different cultures speak to 
the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lullaby Land" (A&M Records) from mellow-voiced veteran Linda Arnold is 
another keeper. This tender release brings fresh life to traditional favorites 
and makes original works such as John Denver's "For Baby" and Arnold's own 
fanciful "Teddy Bear King's Waltz" and the from-the-heart title track seem like 
old friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the abundance of quality spoken-word audiotapes available for children, 
look for Jerry and Nancy Bell's "Celtic Tales for Bedtime Kids" (Celtic 
Celebration). Adults and children can relish these captivatingly performed folk 
tales, interspersed with traditional songs, about mischievous elves, a 
princess, a piper and a miserly landlord. 
</P>
<P>
 Also deserving a place of honor on the shelf is master storyteller Jim Weiss' 
"Fairy Tale Favorites in Story and Song" (Greathall Productions). Weiss has 
never been better or funnier as he puts his enjoyable spin on such tales as 
"Stone Soup," a jazzy "Puss in Boots," "TheShoemaker and the Elves" and 
"Rapunzel." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the umpteen versions of Tchaikovsky's "Peter and the Wolf," don't 
overlook one from Sony Classical, featuring Nickelodeon's delightful "Clarissa 
Explains It All" kid Melissa Joan Hart, with conductor Seiji Ozawa and the 
Boston Symphony Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 Need a pick-me-up? Buckwheat Zydeco's first children's recording, "Choo Choo 
Boogaloo" (Music for Little People), is just the ticket. This collection of 
traditional and original songs from the acclaimed zydeco band, headed by 
Stanley (Buckwheat) Dural Jr., with narration by Winston Williams, is an 
exuberant, toe-tapping, musical train trip through Louisiana Creole culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Professional storyteller-singer Marcia Lane's "River of Stars" (A Gentle 
Wind), is a find, as memorable for its eclectic, global contents -- from the 
Congo tall tale "Why the Frog Has Long Legs" to the evocative Chinese fantasy 
"River of Stars" -- as it is for Lane's clear-voiced, stylish simplicity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bananaphone" (MCA Records), Raffi's first studio children's recording in 
seven years, finds the kids' superstar in a relaxed, playful mood. Comic 
wordplay and great instrumentals predominate; the only sour note: a lugubrious 
"Michael Rowed the Boat Ashore." Did he have to do every verse? 
</P>
<P>
 Babies, toddlers and parents can share play and snuggle time with one of 
Tickle Tune Typhoon's best instrumental and vocal offerings to date: "Patty 
Cakes & Peek-a-Boos" (Music for Little People). Upbeat songs inspire 
hand-clapping, finger-counting and other activities, while lullabies such as 
"Little Owlet" from Germany, "Oh Baby of Mine" and "Baby Bye Oh" are perfect 
for nap time. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny the K's "Party in the Park" (Hats Off Records) is a rib-tickling 
collection of mostly silly songs written by top children's songwriters, 
delivered with pizazz by Johnny Kelleher, plus super musicians and adult and 
child choruses.*

JAZZ; A WEALTH OF CHOICES -- BUT BUYER BEWARE

 Talk about choices. The eclectic array of reissue packages pouring out of the 
record companies provides something to put under the Christmas tree for even 
the jazz fan who has everything. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the reissues are meticulously done, with great care given to providing 
accurate recording data and to producing the best representation of the 
original sound. Others seem focused only upon cashing in on the easy 
availability of material that is no longer controlled by copyright by releasing 
collections that are deficient both in historical information and audio 
reproduction. 
</P>
<P>
 The message is obvious: Buyer beware. Take a close look at the album notes for 
any prospective reissue purchase. Less information generally -- although not 
always -- means less quality. 
</P>
<P>
 A selection of some fairly recent boxed jazz sets reveals that careful, 
knowledgeable compilations can result in valuable and enjoyable additions to 
anyone's library. The items listed below will make desirable entries on a 
Christmas jazz list. 
</P>
<P>
 **** DUKE ELLINGTON, "The Original Decca Recordings, Early Ellington," GRP. 
This three-CD set covers Ellington's complete Brunswick and Vocalion recordings 
from 1926 to 1931. Numerous alternate takes are included, and there is one 
previously unreleased version of "Wall Street Wail." The key pieces, of course, 
are the original readings of "East St. Louis Toodle-o," "Black and Tan 
Fantasy," "The Mooche," "Mood Indigo" and "Creole Rhapsody" -- invaluable items 
in the Ellington lexicon. What is most remarkable about the collection, 
however, is the broad picture it affords of a young, still-inexperienced 
Ellington just beginning to discover his immense talent as he responded to the 
unique attributes of his players and the special demands of his musical 
circumstances. The impact of Bubber Miley's trumpet and Joe Nanton's trombone 
on Ellington's musical thinking are clear from the beginning, as is the 
creativity Ellington applied to the atmospheric "jungle" sounds and dance 
accompaniments required by his ensemble's longtime gig as the Cotton Club house 
band. 
</P>
<P>
 **** LOUIS ARMSTRONG, "Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, 1923-1934," 
Columbia Legacy. Ah, yes. Here's the fountainhead, the music that 
revolutionized the jazz scene of the '20s and early '30s. Columbia's superb 
five-CD anthology includes Armstrong's work with King Oliver and Fletcher 
Henderson, as well as his classic solos on "West End Blues," "Weather Bird," 
"Potato Head Blues" and the inventive scat singing on "Heebie Jeebies" and 
"Hotter Than That." Listening to this amazing burst of originality is almost 
like hearing Armstrong lay out the essential elements of jazz -- rhythmic 
swing, harmonic improvisation, blues-tinged melodies and an irrepressibly 
joyous pursuit of imaginative creativity. The collection also chronicles 
Armstrong's refusal to be pigeonholed into a single category. Leading small 
groups, big bands, playing for blues singers such as Bessie Smith, playing 
trumpet, singing, introducing pop songs to the tradition-bound jazz repertory, 
Armstrong was the first true "crossover" performer. (No better proof exists 
than the rarely heard 1930 track, "Blue Yodel No. 9," in which Armstrong 
accompanies country music singer Jimmie Rodgers.) 
</P>
<P>
 *** 1/2 FRANK SINATRA, "The Song Is You," RCA. Sinatra may not exactly deserve 
the mantle of jazz singer, but there is no doubt that his phrasing, from the 
very beginning, owed far more to Louis Armstrong and Billie Holiday than to 
Bing Crosby and Russ Columbo. This comprehensive anthology of Sinatra's 
recordings with the Tommy Dorsey band documents the gradual emergence of his 
ability, even in the dreamiest ballad, to find the natural rhythmic flow of a 
song. All the Sinatra/Dorsey hits are here -- "I'll Never Smile Again," "There 
Are Such Things," "I'll Be Seeing You," etc. -- as well as a number of 
alternate takes and the first four tunes recorded by Sinatra (with Axel 
Stordahl) after he left Dorsey. It's all marvelous stuff, but it will take a 
real Sinatra fanatic to appreciate the final CD, which showcases excerpts from 
a 1940 radio show featuring songs submitted by Dorsey fans. 
</P>
<P>
 **** THELONIOUS MONK, "The Complete Blue Note Recordings," Blue Note. Any 
doubts about the utter singularity of Monk's musical talent are dispelled from 
the very first track of this four-CD collection, dating from 1947 through 1958. 
Monk, clearly, was his own man from the very beginning (listen, for example, to 
his early rendering of " 'Round Midnight"). While it is possible to hear traces 
of Fats Waller and James P. Johnson in some of his playing, what is far more 
evident is the fact that most of the signature aspects of Monk's style -- the 
oddly voiced chords, the disjunct rhythms and surprisingly catchy melodies -- 
were present in his earliest work. In addition to the recordings made under 
Monk's own name, several bonus tracks include material from a Sonny Rollins 
date in 1957 (with a superb version of "Misterioso"), and a noisy but 
fascinating tape of a complete club set with Monk and John Coltrane from 1958. 
</P>
<P>
 *** 1/2 VARIOUS ARTISTS, "Black Legends of Jazz," GRP. Here's a handy, two-CD 
sampler aimed at providing a kind of mini-history of jazz from 1926 to 1959 out 
of the Decca (as well as the Brunswick and Vocalion) vaults. The results are 
necessarily skewed: There is no Dizzy Gillespie here, no Ben Webster, no Sarah 
Vaughan or (note the album title) Benny Goodman. But what is included is well 
worth the price of admission, from Louis Armstrong's "Mahogany Hall Stomp" and 
Duke Ellington's "Mood Indigo" to Ella Fitzgerald's "Lullaby of Birdland" and 
Count Basie's "One O'Clock Jump." It's the perfect choice for listeners who 
prefer the Reader's Digest approach -- a quick taste of the high points without 
sweating the details. 
</P>
<P>
 **** JOE HENDERSON, "The Milestone Years," Milestone (eight discs). One 
thought keeps reverberating through this superb assemblage: Why has it taken so 
long for Henderson to be acknowledged as one of the most extraordinary jazz 
saxophonists of the last three decades? Henderson was already well established 
when he signed with Milestone in 1967. But the breadth of his skills as 
represented in this compilation -- even for one who heard him perform 
frequently in those years -- is simply awesome. In addition to the complete 
tracks from the 12 Milestone albums recorded between 1967 and 1976, there are 
selections from a session with Nat Adderley, a duet with Lee Konitz and a 
number of sideman contributions to Flora Purim outings. Perhaps best of all, 
there are three previously unissued tracks from a live gig at the Lighthouse in 
1970 with a hard-driving band that included the gifted Woody Shaw on trumpet 
and fluegelhorn. If "The Milestone Years" does nothing else, it affirms 
Henderson as the most complete jazz saxophonist of the post-Rollins/Coltrane 
years, a player who, then and now, brilliantly combines every aspect of jazz, 
from be-bop and R&B to avant-garde and sheer lyricism. It's all here. 
</P>
<P>
 *** "DUENDE: THE PASSION AND DAZZLING VIRTUOSITY OF FLAMENCO," Ellipsis Arts. 
I'm kidding, right? What does flamenco have to do with jazz? Well, look at it 
this way: Flamenco was created by a repressed underclass (Gypsies). It is a 
rhythmic, improvisational music based on a traditional body of pieces that 
allow plenty of room for variation. Often used to accompany a sensual dance, it 
can be purely instrumental, or it can feature passionate, melody stretching 
vocals. Sound familiar? Listen to some of the singers -- young and old -- in 
this three-CD compilation, and analogies with blues shouters singers such as 
Joe Turner quickly come to mind. And, if the rhythms are different in style, 
they are no less urgent or propulsive than jazz rhythms, while the 
improvisations soar with the imaginative probing of jazz solos. Ellipsis Arts 
provides an excellent introduction to the art, with several classic tracks and 
a sampling of contemporary artists. And, in the music of the innovative Diego 
Carrasco, the hard-swinging Barcelona crossover group Jaleo and the 
better-known, jazz-tinged Strunz & Farah, it illustrates the current 
cross-fertilization taking place between jazz and the world's other 
improvisational musics.*

 I was heartened to hear of studios' efforts to restore and release much-loved 
and unavailable film classics for home video ("A Trip Down Celluloid Lane," by 
Susan King, Nov. 13). Two of the titles mentioned -- "Porgy and Bess" and 
"Annie Get Your Gun" -- are held up in a legal limbo that would tax King 
Solomon. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year in an interview with The Times, the lawyer for the Gershwin estate 
bluntly stated that all effort was being brought to bear on finding and 
destroying any existing copies of Sam Goldwyn's production of "Porgy and Bess," 
directed by Otto Preminger and starring Sidney Poitier and Dorothy Dandridge. 
The reason given was the late Ira Gershwin's dislike of the film; he felt that 
his opera had been turned into a musical, a fair assessment that nonetheless 
disparages the sizable talent involved: Sammy Davis Jr., Pearl Bailey and the 
voice of Robert McFerrin. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to my fax, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences President 
Arthur Hiller was kind enough to investigate, and in his reply he assured me 
that a safety negative was secure in the Goldwyn vaults. While I was cheered to 
know this, I am still dismayed that future generations will be denied the 
opportunity to see this classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Another executive who was helpful in my quest, Dick May of Turner 
Entertainment, detailed the similar plight of "Annie Get Your Gun," which 
starred Betty Hutton and Howard Keel. May said the late Irving Berlin was 
disappointed in Hutton, having had his heart set on Judy Garland, who was fired 
from the production because of her instability. In addition, his heirs fear 
that the stereotypical representations of Native Americans might be found 
offensive. The result? An inventory of ready-to-market restored copies of 
"Annie" sitting in a warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
 I find the efforts of the Gershwin and Berlin heirs to deny audiences the 
chance to view these films an abomination to cinematic history and a violation 
of the rights of the other artists involved in these productions.

 Your cover story on "Star Trek" executive producer Rick Berman touched on an 
issue that has been bothering me (" 'Star Trek' Only a Show? Is This Guy 
Serious?" Nov. 13). 
</P>
<P>
 It is an issue even more serious that the trend toward militarism on "Star 
Trek."The problem is that the Federation and humans have hostile relationships 
with all the other recurring alien civilizations except for Vulcans and 
Bayjorans, and even then, resentment and friction are common. 
</P>
<P>
 I find it disturbing that Romulans, Klingons, Cardassians, Ferengi and most of 
what Cerone terms "the whole gang in the Alpha Quadrant" are imbued with evil 
qualities right out of a textbook on racial stereotypes and prejudice. Is it 
too much to ask for a recurring alien civilization that is nice ? 
</P>
<P>
 Why are humans the only species that is consistently decent and polite? The 
Thrill civilization (which we've seen only once) could be further developed 
along those lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of projecting our fear of others to alien creatures, I suggest an 
occasional story about overcoming our need to have enemies. Even if it is a 
difficult task, it is worth doing.

 Rick Berman is corporate, not artistic. By complying with the studio's edict 
for multiple spinoffs, the entire endeavor now exists in name only. 
</P>
<P>
 The current movie is merely a TV episode, saddled with small-screen scripting. 
"Deep Space Nine" is a muddle, and the upcoming "Voyager" sounds dangerously 
like one of the mediocre rip-offs (i.e., "seaQuest," "Babylon 5") that this 
whole bonanza inspired. 
</P>
<P>
 With Berman holding all the reins, "Star Trek" has truly become a "franchise." 
Just like a fast-food chain, there's a lot of "Star Trek" everywhere . . . but 
the quality is none too good.

'ER' PARENTAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once again we see success has many fathers ("Beyond Blood and Yucks," by Rick 
Du Brow, Nov. 6)! 
</P>
<P>
 Du Brow states that Tony Thomopoulos, president of Spielberg's Amblin 
television division, found the "ER" script and was told by Spielberg to "run 
with it" regarding the genesis of this current hit show. 
</P>
<P>
 How ironic that in the next day's Daily Variety it states: "It was (Creative 
Artists Agency) TV agent Tony Krantz who convinced (Michael) Crichton to dust 
off an old script that was literally lying in a trunk and turn it into a TV 
series. The result was the phenomenally successful new NBC drama 'ER.' That 
master stroke led to a hefty packaging fee for the agency." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so which is it, which Tony was the "discoverer" of "ER"? 
</P>
<P>

</P>

</P>
<P>
 Thomopoulos says that he and Krantz "both had talked about it" and that "I had 
seen the script at Amblin." He adds that both of them "went to see Crichton 
together" and that Krantz "was very instrumental in the instigation of this" 
and should "get his due." Krantz declined to comment through a CAA 
spokesperson, who said Thomopoulos' statement "sounds good to us."

SEDUCED ON 42ND ST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I don't know who writer Susanne C. Stahley's sources were ("Seedy N.Y. Setting 
Suits Latest 'Vanya,' " Film Clips, Nov. 6), but I can definitely tell you that 
the great New Amsterdam Theater on New York's 42nd Street was not "abandoned 
for 40 years." 
</P>
<P>
 As a young actor-writer in the late '50s, I was privileged to spend many an 
evening in that moldering heap watching a steady stream of reissues of some of 
the greatest films ever made. 
</P>
<P>
 One rainy night, while standing adjacent to the box office, awaiting a taxi, I 
glanced upon a piece of peeling papier-mache, and the gorgeous marble it was 
covering, and it suddenly hit me: "Good lord! This must be Ziegfeld's famed 
theater -- the place where Fanny Brice, Eddie Cantor, Marilyn Miller, Will 
Rogers and his other stars came to give the midnight shows in the Amsterdam 
Roof Theater." 
</P>
<P>
 And if she did go on to become a porno house, it was well after my 
acquaintance with her. All hail the Disney Co. for planning to restore her to 
her true glory; I and her other fans will rejoice on the day that comes to 
pass.

SOUTHLAND HOME SALES FLATTEN OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 October home sales in Southern California were flat, indicating a slowdown in 
real estate activity, according to TRW REDI Property Data, a real estate 
information company. Still, home sales so far this year are 17% higher than the 
same period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 TRW REDI reports that between January and October more than 171,000 new and 
existing homes closed escrow compared to just under 150,000 a year ago. Within 
the Southern California region all counties have posted strong gains, with 
Orange County showing a very healthy increase of 22%. 
</P>
<P>
 "The slowdown in October sales was anticipated and is due to the usual 
seasonal factors. Long-term trends in sales activity, however, show clearly 
that Southern California's housing market is experiencing a modest recovery," 
said Nima Nattagh, TRW REDI's market analyst. Southland Home Sales

POP EYE: GOING . . . GOING . . . GONE; GARTH BROOKS' GREATEST-HITS ALBUM AND 
PRINCE'S 'BLACK ALBUM' WILL HAVE SHORT SHELF LIVES -- DELIBERATELY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Bruce Haring

<TEXT>
<P>
 Get 'em while they're hot! 
</P>
<P>
 That's the cry going out to Garth Brooks and Prince fans regarding their new 
albums. These are limited-time offers, folks. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks' greatest-hits package, due in stores Dec. 20, will be off the shelves 
by summer, and Prince's long-withheld "Black Album," released last week, will 
be unavailable after January. 
</P>
<P>
 The strategy is fairly common in the home video market -- especially with 
Disney, which releases such classics as "Snow White" and "Cinderella" for 
limited times. The idea is to turn them into seasonal specials that can be 
revived every few years or so. 
</P>
<P>
 But music, except for Christmas albums, doesn't generally work that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks' albums in particular have a track record of selling over long periods 
of time -- all four of his regular albums remain in the Billboard magazine 
country music Top 50, with his debut still selling steadily more than four 
years after its release. 
</P>
<P>
 So why pull the hits collection off the market after six months? 
</P>
<P>
 "Garth wanted to treat it as a special event," says Scott Stem, spokesman for 
Brooks' manager Bob Doyle. The idea is also to provide something to introduce 
Brooks to new fans who could later explore the older albums.  
</P>
<P>
 The plan was inspired by the country star's participation in a similar 
limited-edition campaign staged in the fall by McDonald's. Brooks was one of 
several artists, including Elton John and Tina Turner, to have anthologies 
available only through the fast-food chain and only for a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 EMI Records, which put that promotion together, claims that a total of 10 
million CDs and cassettes were sold in the deal, though actual figures have not 
been made available. In any case, it was good enough for Brooks to give it a 
try on his own. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-month expiration date on Prince's album apparently has more to do with 
the bitter legal squabbling between the Minneapolis maverick and Warner Bros. 
Records than any real marketing game plan. Bob Merlis, Warner Bros.' senior 
vice president of media, acknowledges that the arrangement is a compromise 
between the artist and the label arising from uncertainty about his future 
contract status. 
</P>
<P>
 While the sales potential of the Prince album is questionable -- it has, after 
all, been widely bootlegged since it was originally planned for release in 1987 
-- the Brooks album would seem to be a sure-fire hit. Retailers, though, are 
less upset about the limited sales period than they are about the timing of the 
release -- just five days before Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll sell great, but if stores run out fast there's no chance to reorder 
before Christmas," says Bob Bell, new-release buyer for the Wherehouse chain. 
"We've never seen a release of someone of this stature in Christmas Week 
before." Bruce Haring

 Though critics have been taking potshots at Frank Sinatra's "Duets II," the 
album seems to be criticism-proof. It debuted at No. 9 on the Times Southern 
California pop chart and No. 16 nationally.Look for it to be a big seller 
during the Christmas shopping season.

 PEARLS OF WISDOM: Another album coming out too close to Christmas to suit 
retailers is Pearl Jam's "Vitalogy." A limited vinyl release of the album is in 
stores now, but the full run of CDs and cassettes won't hit until Dec. 6, 
leaving only 18 holiday shopping days for fans. 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't mean they can't hear the album: Several radio stations have 
played it in its entirety, allowing fans to tape it. The first was L.A.'s 
KROQ-FM, which obtained a copy on Nov. 17 and played it twice that day -- 
defying an embargo set by Epic Records asking that it not be aired until last 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the floodgates opened: KLOS-FM started playing individual songs about an 
hour after KROQ's breach. The station then played the whole album last Sunday 
and others around the country ignored the Monday directive and played it all 
weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 KROQ program director Kevin Weatherly says that his voice mail was filled to 
the brim with calls from livid Epic Records executives the day after he aired 
the album. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time a leak like this occurs people get all uptight and bent out of 
shape," says Weatherly, who would not reveal how he got a copy of the album. 
"But the bottom line is we're here to do what we feel is the best thing for 
KROQ listeners, and a Pearl Jam release is a big event. We've earned a 
reputation for getting things early and we hope to do more in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Epic Records executives were unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Radio programmers couldn't have asked for a better Hanukkah present: the 
most-talked-about new album in rock, available only on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great for radio to have a hit album that nobody can buy yet," says 
programming consultant Jeff Pollack.

 WHO'S THAT GIRL?: We sneered two years ago when Courtney Love was quoted in 
Vanity Fair saying that she expected Madonna to steal her punkish look: 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care how vain and arrogant this sounds, but just watch. . . . 
Madonna's going to have roots (showing), she's going to have smeared eyeliner," 
Love said. "And that's me. . . . She wants my image." 
</P>
<P>
 Madonna's quoted response: "Who is Courtney Love?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, have you seen the latest issue of Details magazine?  
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was Courtney," says an associate of the singer who asked not to 
be named, after viewing the cover photo featuring the Material Girl with ratted 
blond hair (roots a-showin') and smeared black eyeliner. 
</P>
<P>
 Madonna spokeswoman Liz Rosenberg acknowledges that a lot of people have 
mistaken the photo for Love, but says that Madonna is not guilty of copping 
Love's look. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like this was the first time she had smeared eyeliner or roots 
showing," Rosenberg says, noting that in an upcoming video Madonna has an 
entirely different look that's nothing like Love's. Steve Hochman

 It's R.E.M. month for Tori Amos. She's teaming with Michael Stipe to record a 
new song for the soundtrack to "Don Juan DeMarco" (starring Johnny Depp, Marlon 
Brando and Faye Dunaway), and is also recording her own version of R.E.M.'s 
"Losing My Religion" for director John Singleton's "Higher Learning."... 
</P>
<P>
 Soundgarden's Chris Cornell and Latin pop star Selena have also recorded songs 
for "Don Juan." The album is due Feb. 14. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. version of former Pogues singer Shane MacGowan's solo debut album, 
"The Snake," will feature a duet with Sinead O'Connor on a song titled 
"Haunted." The album is credited to Shane MacGowan & the Popes and will be in 
stores here on Feb. 14. The duet is not on the just-released British version. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 Sparks' first British concert in 17 years on Nov. 17 had an all-star audience, 
including Morrissey, Depeche Mode's Martin Gore and Erasure's Vince Clarke, 
while former Suede guitarist Bernard Butler joined the group onstage for three 
songs. Sparks, now just brothers Ron and Russell Mael and a percussionist, will 
release its first album in six years in the spring. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In other comeback news, Boston will hit the road in May for its first tour 
since 1986. . . . The debut album by Wilco, featuring former members of Uncle 
Tupelo, is due in March. . . . The Dec. 17 concert by blues veteran Johnny 
(Guitar) Watson at B.B. King's Blues Club in Universal City will be broadcast 
live nationally on ABC radio's "Touch Network." The L.A. outlet is to be 
determined.*

CLASSICAL; TRADITION UPDATED, SOME GAPS FILLED

 It's never easy to characterize a recording year such as the one almost past, 
when no major composer's birth -- or, as is becoming ghoulishly fashionable, 
death -- was being celebrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Gregorian Chant, marketed as white noise, "for stress reduction," as one CD 
cover sticker boldly put it, unquestionably continued to "happen," as did 
other, more invasive medieval material. The recording companies gambled (but 
with little risk) by pitching mostly old recordings of "Chant" (as we now call 
it) not to the classical types who ignored them a few decades back, but to New 
Wave audiences, who embraced the style with quiet fervor. Which isn't to say 
there won't be a Chant entry here. Just wait! 
</P>
<P>
 People who listen to classical recordings for a living pay scant attention to 
what's issued at holiday time, which tends to be repackaged or overexposed 
material. But there is a new, worthwhile "Messiah" -- Handel's that is -- from 
the French group called Les Arts Florissant, whose orchestra and chorus are 
conducted by Les Arts' American founder, William Christie: a superbly conceived 
period production, played and sung by small forces making a brave noise, as 
attentive to the bright colors and dancing rhythms of the score as to its 
majesty (Harmonia Mundi 901498/9, two CDs). 
</P>

 The vast B-minor Mass of Johann Sebastian Bach was likewise presented 
recently, not as embalmed ritual but as living music by the spectacularly 
accomplished Arnold Schoenberg Chorus of Vienna under its director, Erwin 
Ortner, who also knows how to handle his orchestra, the superb, 
period-instrument Salzburg Baroque Ensemble (Koch-Schwann 1251, two CDs). 
</P>
<P>
 Violinists reigned with the recording companies this year, led by Midori and 
her powerful, sensitive account of the Sibelius Concerto, with Zubin Mehta and 
the Israel Philharmonic (Sony 58967), and Kyoko Takezawa teamed with Colin 
Davis and the Bavarian Radio Symphony for a lithe, loving account of Elgar's 
lumpy (in lesser hands) Violin Concerto (RCA Victor 61612). 
</P>
<P>
 Some of us were listening to pianists, too, not that it's possible to avoid 
Jeno Jando, the Hungarian omnivore, who was at his most stimulated and 
stimulating in sonatas of Joseph Haydn (Naxos 550657), delivering the last four 
the composer wrote with fierce joyousness and optimum clarity of articulation. 
Imagine Sviatoslav Richter on uppers. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding Richter, the ever-charismatic Russian master: By all means treat 
yourself to his dreamy and dramatic performance of the great Fantasy in C, part 
of a glorious Schumann reissue (EMI 64625). 
</P>
<P>
 There were so many superior releases in the chamber-music category this year 
that I'll hawk only two: a coupling of the Piano Quartet, Opus 87, and the 
Piano Quintet, Opus 81, of Dvorak delivered with dancing vivacity and endless 
tonal resources by the Emerson String Quartet and the irrepressible Menahem 
Pressler (Deutsche Grammophon 439 868). 
</P>
<P>
 The second inspires nostalgia and renewed respect for the splendid quartet 
that was once L.A.'s own, the Hollywood String Quartet, who with sympathetic 
colleagues recorded Schubert's sublime Quintet in C and Schoenberg's "Verklarte 
Nacht" in the early 1950s -- hugely affectionate, polished interpretations that 
can now be savored in excellent digital remasterings (Testament 1031). 
</P>
<P>
 In the art-song category, 1994 was likewise lavish in its rewards, among them 
the ageless Peter Schreier's exquisitely urbane recital of lieder by Felix 
Mendelssohn (Berlin Classics 1107) and, in another of her excursions into 
treasurable, unhackneyed repertory, soprano Roberta Alexander gave us a 
generous helping of Heitor Villa-Lobos' tangy Brazilian folk-song arrangements 
(Etcetera 1165). 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually buried by a deluge of orchestral music we didn't need was a handful 
of releases that either added significantly to the catalogue or refreshed 
relatively familiar music. Among the former was an example of the successful 
partnership forged by Esa-Pekka Salonen, the Los Angeles Philharmonic and 
Witold Lutoslawski by way of the work the late Polish composer wrote expressly 
for the Philharmonic, his Fourth Symphony. It's heard (on Sony 66288) with 
reissues of recordings Salonen made here in 1985 of Lutos lawki's Third 
Symphony and "Les Espaces du sommeil." All are outstanding examples of 
Lutoslawski's refined art and craft, at once elegant, tough-minded and 
accessible (Sony 66280). 
</P>
<P>
 Another orchestral winner was unexpected: the Seven Symphonies of Jean 
Sibelius, sumptuously recorded in the 1970s by Kurt Sanderling and his Berlin 
Symphony and so briefly available in the U.S. then that nobody noticed them. 
The deepest, darkest, north woods-mysterious interpretations of this music I 
have experienced (Berlin Classics 2059, four CDs). 
</P>
<P>
 This year has brought us at least two not merely enjoyable but downright 
necessary opera recordings: the first complete edition of Rossini's inventive, 
exciting "Semiramide," with a splendidly accomplished cast of American 
principals, Cheryl Studer, Jennifer Larmore, Samuel Ramey and Frank Lopardo, 
under conductor Ion Marin (Deutsche Grammophon 437 797, three CDs), and for the 
first time in a single package, all of Mozart's "Don Giovanni," i.e., both the 
original Prague and subsequent Vienna versions (EMI 54859, three CDs), with 
Roger Norrington leading with a combination of lightness and dramatic fervor 
his period-instrument London Classical Players and a cast dominated by the 
dashingly dangerous Don of Andreas Schmidt and Lynne Dawson's sweetly smitten 
Donna Elvira. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, stuff your stockings (or whatever) with these bargains: the five Beethoven 
Cello Sonatas -- the names of the performers say it all, Rostropovich and 
Richter (Philips 442 565, two CDs); the First Symphony of the all-but-forgotten 
Mily Balakirev, Russian Romanticism with all the implied fat tunes but without 
the breast-beating, and the same composer's kitschy-colorful "Islamey," 
delivered with raucous glee by the Russian State Symphony under Igor Golovschin 
(Naxos 550792), and a marvelous mixed bag called "The Spanish Harpsichord" in 
which Igor Kipnis plays Baroque solos by Domenico Scarlatti and Antonio Soler 
(his hair-raising "Fandango") and Manuel de Falla's spiky little Concerto, with 
Pierre Boulez conducting soloists of the New York Philharmonic (Sony Essential 
Classics 53264). 
</P>
<P>
 Not to forget Chant -- specifically, "Chantmania," as this brief, inexpensive 
collection (Rhino 76025) is called: The vocalists are the incomparable 
Benzedrine Monks of Santo Domonica -- who, to quote Fr. Irwin's helpful, even 
inspiring program notes, embark "each morning . . . on a soul-restoring sunrise 
pilgrimage through Venice Beach on holy-roller blades," among other activities. 
The selections include such sure-fire chantchart toppers (reportedly being 
hummed around numerous refectory tables worldwide already) as "(Theme From) The 
MONKeeS" and, perhaps emblematic of the skills of these simple toilers in the 
fertile gardens of lowest-key homophony, the John Cage-inspired "Monks' Vow of 
Silence."*

TO WEST TEXANS, IT'S 'GOD'S COUNTRY'; FRONTIER: THE REGION IS DRY, DUSTY AND 
VIRTUALLY DESERTED. EARLY EXPLORERS COMPARED IT TO HELL. BUT THE HARDY FEW WHO 
LIVE THERE FEEL DIFFERENTLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A century and a half ago, an Army explorer stumbled onto a hauntingly remote 
and desolate chunk of Texas prairie and was not much impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 W. B. Parker branded the hills and plains "inhospitable" and declared: 
</P>
<P>
 "Destitute of soil, timber, water, game and everything else that can sustain 
or make life tolerable, they must remain as they are, uninhabited and 
uninhabitable." He vowed never to return. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, that relentlessly raw land was eventually settled, if sparsely. But 
major highways bypassed it, other Texans ignored it, and it remains today a 
region with little population or prosperity and no name or identity of its own 
beyond a few hardscrabble farms and ranches and small and struggling towns. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, though, the land holds a wonderful secret that touches the native 
soul. 
</P>
<P>
 Joy Cave, a Guthrie schoolteacher, put it this way: "We don't belong to 
anybody. We belong to ourselves." Then she added: 
</P>
<P>
 "Guthrie is the geographical center of nowhere . . . but something has kept me 
here. I just love it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Micky Parker, the librarian in Jayton, population 638, "We're really kind 
of stepchildren here." 
</P>
<P>
 So where is "here?" 
</P>
<P>
 It is an ill-defined territory, well west of Ft. Worth, where the West 
purportedly begins. It lies north of Interstate 20 within a triangle connecting 
Wichita Falls, Abilene and Lubbock. 
</P>
<P>
 A true map of "here" probably would include all or large parts of nine West 
Texas counties and bits and pieces of five others. That's roughly 8,500 square 
miles, an area larger than the whole of Rhode Island, Delaware and Connecticut. 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer than 25,000 people live in this phantom state within a state, many on 
small farms and larger ranches where the earth yields few crops and a relative 
trickle of Texas crude oil. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no tourist attractions, no daily newspapers, no television stations. 
Jobs are scarce, health care erratic, the population aging and declining. Many 
schools have closed. Other high schools, unable to field 11 players, play 
six-man football, sometimes in front of an audience of pickup trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 What does the citizenry say of this geographic dead zone? 
</P>
<P>
 They boast that drugs and crime are pretty much nil, that the people are close 
and caring and, most of all, that it's a great place to rear children. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's God's Country," said Janelle Barry of Spur, which is about as close as 
any to being this region's quasi-capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Big Empty," native son Jim Corder joked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always looking for West Texas or my part of it, and not finding it," 
Corder wrote in "Lost in West Texas," a whimsical and charming book that deals 
largely with his nameless homeland. 
</P>
<P>
 "My part of West Texas doesn't show up much in books," thus leaving a "hole" 
in Texas, he grumbled. Outsiders, he said, "miss the strange and lonesome 
beauty: the view one sees of the Double Mountains down the Salt Fork from the 
highway bridge between Swenson and Jayton; the first dramatic drop into the 
deep of the Croton Breaks. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Corder, an English professor at Texas Christian University, was born near 
Jayton, but even he cannot pinpoint the boundaries of his province. "It just 
doesn't have any identity, except in the minds of the people who live there," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Corder figures W. B. Parker and his expedition leader, U.S. Army Capt. 
Randolph Marcy, flirted with his province when they ventured into what is now 
King County many years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 As quoted by Corder, Marcy was even less impressed with the region than 
Parker. "It is, in almost every respect, the most uninteresting and forbidding 
land I have ever visited," the commander grumped, and spoke harshly of its 
"barren parsimonious soil." 
</P>
<P>
 Still true. This place is too dry, too dusty and hammered too often by winds 
from hell. The prevailing south winds were lashing gnarled mesquite trees as a 
visitor arrived in Rule, population 783, on the southeastern edge of Jim 
Corder's cosmos. 
</P>
<P>
 The playground at Slim Sorrells Park is as empty as the Western Winds Motel 
and the Rule Memorial Museum, which is "Open by Appointment" only. The Rule 
drive-in picture show is open weekends from April "until it gets cold." 
</P>
<P>
 Across the Double Mountain Fork of the Brazos is a German settlement once 
named Brandenburg but, for patriotic purposes, became Old Glory in 1918. An 
American flag still flutters in the center of what is now little more than a 
shell of a town. Its school shut down eight years ago, the grocery-service 
station more recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I'm the only fella here," drawled Lisbon Letz, the Old Glory 
postmaster for 36 years. "Time's starting to pass pretty quick now." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the town of Swenson, named for the once-great Swenson ranching 
empire. Fat cattle wearing the famous SMS brand once roamed ranches in central, 
west and northwest Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Swenson is a ghost town, its most forlorn remnant a red brick bank founded 
in 1911. The hot Texas sun peers through holes in the roof. Over the doorway an 
awning of metal and wood hangs like something dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Few natives know the country better than Gene Swenson of Stamford. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of this damn land that the only thing you can do is run a cow 
on it," he said, and even then it sometimes requires 35 acres per cow. 
"Basically, this is ranch country. In my opinion, some of it was plowed up that 
shouldn't have been." 
</P>
<P>
 In Jayton, the walls of the shuttered Barfoot Hotel are cracked and the paint 
has peeled. The weekly Jayton Chronicle is moribund, too, even though the town 
has fared better than most. Mobil Oil and the highway department are active 
employers, and there is a Chevrolet dealership. 
</P>
<P>
 A downtown historical marker reveals that the Double Mountain Salt Works was 
located along the Brazos River on the "Indian-infested frontier" and was the 
northernmost business in Confederate Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Jayton also is the county seat -- but that was not always so. 
</P>
<P>
 According to one juicy tale, cattle trucks whisked the county records from the 
original courthouse in Clairemont, a mysterious fire destroyed the building and 
the records emerged in Jayton. So would a new courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "That makes a good story," said librarian Micky Parker, but no such raid 
occurred. Furthermore, it was an electrical fire during a sandstorm in the 
drought-ridden '50s that demolished the Clairemont courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no mystery about the Jayton school system, which is first-class. Jim 
Corder, who attended the old school, marveled at the grass-covered football 
field, lights and closed-in press box. 
</P>
<P>
 "When my brother played football at Jayton," he wrote, "I remember watching 
the principal draw off the yard markers in the dirt with a hoe." 
</P>
<P>
 Jayton High's Jaybirds once played eight-man, then 11-man, and now six-man 
football. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Richards, a Lubbock attorney, played on Jaybird teams three decades ago 
and planned to return for this year's homecoming game and his 30th class 
reunion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great place to grow up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He remembers having to travel to Aspermont for the movies and to Spur to shoot 
pool. And mischief in those days was faking late-night accidents to stop truck 
drivers on U.S. 380, or driving a car across the train trestle at the Brazos 
River. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Jayton's superb educational system is now threatened by the 
state's so-called Robin Hood school finance plan, which funnels tax money from 
rich to poor districts. 
</P>
<P>
 As a school official once explained: "Our people are very poor. We just happen 
to have a pool of oil in the center of the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Knox City, population 1,440 and the county seat of nearby Knox County, is also 
something of a paradox. Debbie's is a friendly catfish and chicken fried steak 
place, but the Oil Patch Cafe is closed and abandoned. 
</P>
<P>
 On Ranch Road 222 to Guthrie, home of the famous Four Sixes ranch, the terrain 
turns hilly and rocky. But an oasis, the Chaparral, appears out of nowhere to 
offer wine, beer and liquor. 
</P>
<P>
 It is one of few such outposts in a steadfastly dry region. 
</P>
<P>
 Purple wildflowers, defying all odds, sprout along the road, a lonely cow is 
wedged under a shade tree in a faraway field, and civilization is not much in 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 The road feeds into U.S. 82 and, after crossing the South Wichita River, which 
is bone dry, leads into Guthrie past the King County Courthouse and up to the 
headquarters of the 6666. 
</P>
<P>
 The Texas Almanac puts the county population at 367, not quite half of it in 
Guthrie. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Guthrie is little more than a ranch supply center, there is a library 
next to the courthouse, and "Lost in West Texas" was afforded lofty display 
this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've found a good place to get lost," declared part-time librarian Karen 
Pettiet, who has lived here almost all of her 40 years. "It's true, there's not 
really much to see out here. 
</P>
<P>
 "But there's something you can't identify. This is a fantastic place." 
</P>
<P>
 Along the highway from Guthrie to Dickens temperatures hover near 100 degrees 
and wind kicks up distant dust devils. This is truly the wide-open spaces. An 
occasional windmill interrupts the monotony. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 322 people call Dickens home, but they have the essentials of all West 
Texas towns: a Church of Christ, a Baptist church and a cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 The drive-in is history, so Dickens has a youth-oriented video business 
operating out of a house. They bring quilts, pillows, candy and soft drinks 
along with 50 cents admission and flop down in front of a TV screen equipped 
with a VCR. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got 25 kids in town and we've been having about 30 show up," chuckled 
proprietor Mike Porter. "So we think it's a success." 
</P>
<P>
 Up the highway, the Double H Motel has rooms with refrigerated air, electric 
heat, phones and truck parking. A gourmet jelly store is long gone but the 
nearby Ponderosa cafe advertises the "world's largest" barbecue sandwich. 
</P>
<P>
 In neighboring Spur, a garbage company once announced in the weekly paper that 
trash would not be picked up as scheduled because of a holiday. It added: 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole town will be picked up on Tuesday." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Corder returned to his homeland in the '80s and wrote wistfully of the 
Croton Breaks, Golden Pond and other special places in his childhood "cosmos." 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get to Aspermont, you're there," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 There? 
</P>
<P>
 "There," he said, "is just around a curve on the other side of town. There, 
off to the left in the blue distance, blue above the broken plain surrounding 
them -- the Double Mountains." 
</P>
<P>
 God lives atop the Double Mountains, Corder insists. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Double Mountains are not only the dwelling place of God, but also, as the 
markers of my province, they are the first boundary of the cosmos," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Stopped by fences, ravines or a gate marked "Posted," Corder's approach to the 
Double Mountains was stymied. 
</P>
<P>
 A more recent visitor circled the mountains for three days. Like Corder, he 
never reached them, so could not confirm that God lives there. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sammy Baugh does. The former TCU football great and pro Hall of Famer owns 
a ranch that backs up to the southern edge.

DNA NOBEL WINNER ASKS BIG QUESTIONS; SCIENCE: TODAY DR. FRANCIS CRICK IS BUSY 
WADING INTO OTHER SCIENTIFIC SWAMPS: HOW DID THE EARTH COME ABOUT? WHAT ARE 
DREAMS? HOW DOES THE BRAIN WORK? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERNEST SANDER, ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 You go to the grocery store and find new, redder, longer-lasting tomatoes. You 
come home and turn on the television and find lawyers discussing O. J. Simpson 
blood tests. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the connection? 
</P>
<P>
 A 77-year-old man with shaggy white eyebrows and an impish grin -- Dr. Francis 
Crick. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty years ago, Crick and a fellow researcher unveiled the intertwined spiral 
model we now identify as DNA, which holds the coding that makes some of us 
blond and others brunette. 
</P>
<P>
 But these days, as the DNA frontiers continue to explode around him, Crick has 
only a "distanced" interest in the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 He is too busy wading into other scientific swamps, seeking answers to Big 
Questions that haunt inquiring minds: How did Earth come about? What are 
dreams? How does the brain work? 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many other scientists, Crick, who was born in Britain and lived there 
until he was 60, rarely sets foot in a lab or a classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Essentially I read and think," says the affable but media-shy Crick, showing 
a reporter a stack of research papers with esoteric titles and offering wryly 
to loan him one. 
</P>
<P>
 And then he writes books. 
</P>
<P>
 In one, Crick postulates that the Earth began when microorganisms were dropped 
by a spaceship from a higher civilization. 
</P>
<P>
 In another, he theorizes that dreams are not the tangle of emotions and hidden 
drives psychoanalysts would have us believe. Rather, he writes, their function 
is to allow the brain to flush itself so one's memory can function the 
following day. 
</P>
<P>
 Crick admits that some of his offerings are a bit "out there," a tad 
"speculative." Some, he even says, he might like to revise. But it doesn't 
bother Crick, the recipient of a 1962 Nobel Prize for his DNA work, that some 
of his musings may turn out to be wildly off the mark. 
</P>
<P>
 "A man who is right every time is not likely to do very much," he says, 
sitting in his Salk Institute office, a serene and cozy wood-paneled room with 
views of the Pacific Ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until about 20 years after Crick and partner James Watson discovered 
the molecular structure of DNA that their conclusions were firmly established. 
At the time, says Crick, only a small number of people "even thought it was 
interesting." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the way science works, he explains. You make a discovery, you generate 
a theory. Sometimes it works, more often it doesn't. Sometimes you don't live 
long enough to find out. 
</P>
<P>
 It's true that without the 1953 Crick-Watson research, the world probably 
wouldn't be eating plumper, redder tomatoes or watching lawyers feud over 
Simpson blood tests results. 
</P>
<P>
 But this new power -- the power to manipulate genes -- also has led to raging 
debates about whether scientists will someday be breeding human beings, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Think of the effect television has had worldwide on politics," said Crick. 
"You can't possibly expect the man who invented the transistor to have seen 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can just reckon that any powerful technique you invent, even if it is 
beneficial, is going to have effects much wider than you think, and it's going 
to have some disadvantages." 
</P>
<P>
 Crick's latest trek into the unknown is the book "The Astonishing Hypothesis: 
The Scientific Search for the Soul." Its central tenet -- that everything we 
see, feel and think is nothing more than the behaviors of a pack of neurons and 
molecules -- is vintage Crick. 
</P>
<P>
 If true, it would mean that things like sadness or desire are not attributable 
to some inner spirit or will, but caused by brain chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you explain why blue looks blue?" asks Crick. "It's no use saying the sky 
looks blue. That doesn't say why it looks blue. Why doesn't it look red? . . . 
That's a very difficult question. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are trying to go around that and find out what happens in your head when 
you see blue. Maybe that will give us a clue to answer these difficult 
questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Crick says he enjoys his life. He still comes to the office daily and often 
stays for the full day, although he has no official duties. 
</P>
<P>
 He professes to be irritated by interruptions of any sort -- especially of the 
media variety. Nonetheless, he remains witty and charming throughout an 
hourlong interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see, I'm one of these people who is against communication," he says in 
British tones that are part Oxford don, part Monty Python. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want less communication because far many more people want to communicate 
with me than I want to communicate with." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Nobel, well, he's found it can be very helpful when trying to 
secure a visa in a hurry. But other times, he says, it's a real albatross. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you go out to dinner, it's a good idea to conceal the fact that you've got 
a Nobel Prize," he explains. "Otherwise they don't know what to say."

VOLCANOES STRUNG ALONG CASCADE RANGE DEFINE PICTURESQUE POWDER KEG; NORTHWEST: 
AN AVERAGE OF TWO ERUPTIONS A CENTURY HAVE OCCURRED IN THE CASCADES OVER THE 
LAST 4,000 YEARS. MAJESTIC MT. RAINIER IS CONSIDERED THE MOST DANGEROUS TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVIS MAZIE, NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The pre-dawn earthquake that shook the foothills of Mt. Rainier in September 
was mild. But it was enough to remind residents of the Pacific Northwest that 
they live on top of a picturesque powder keg. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is nature's beauty-and-beast behavior more compelling than along the 
Cascade Range that stretches 1,000 miles from southern British Columbia to 
Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 But beneath snowcapped peaks, green forests and flowering alpine meadows 
churns one of the biggest chains of active volcanoes in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen large volcanic centers in the American portion of the Cascades have 
erupted before. "And they all could do it again," warned Dan Dzurisin, the 
scientist in charge of the U.S. Geological Survey's Cascades Volcano 
Observatory here. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last 4,000 years, an average of two eruptions a century have occurred 
in the Cascades. Majestic Mt. Rainier, just 40 miles southeast of Seattle, is 
considered the most dangerous today. 
</P>
<P>
 "For millions of years, the pattern has been long periods of quiet punctuated 
by brief eruptions," Dzurisin said. "There's no reason to think this isn't 
exactly what's happening now. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that there hasn't been an eruption for several years, or several 
hundred years, doesn't mean the volcanoes are extinct. It just means that 
they're in an in-between period. Eruptions are coming." 
</P>
<P>
 Dzurisin emphasizes that geologists are not predicting imminent major 
explosions. "It could be decades, it could be centuries. But history tells us 
it will happen again." 
</P>
<P>
 During the 37-million-year history of the Cascades, entire volcanoes have 
built up, collapsed, eroded away and been replaced by new ones. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven Cascade volcanoes have erupted since American independence in 1776. Mt. 
St. Helens in 1980 still ranks as the worst volcanic disaster in modern U.S. 
history. Fifty-seven people died. 
</P>
<P>
 Worldwide, the 1980s were one of the most volatile decades of volcanic 
devastation ever recorded, causing more than 28,500 deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that the world's volcanoes are becoming more active, but that 
population pressures are causing more people to live near dangerous volcanoes," 
Dzurisin said. 
</P>
<P>
 That is one of the reasons why Mt. Rainier, which is a threat to 2.5 million 
people in the Seattle-Tacoma area, is among several volcanoes targeted by an 
international volcanology association for special study. 
</P>
<P>
 Geologists are convinced that Rainier, built by countless eruptions during its 
half-million-year history and recently active with minor eruptions and 
earthquakes, will explode again, spewing suffocating blankets of ash and 
sluggish lava flows. 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest danger, however, is likely to come from debris flows, mixtures of 
water-saturated earth, rock and debris that can move at speeds of up to 100 
m.p.h. and destroy distant communities. 
</P>
<P>
 At 14,410 feet, Mt. Rainier is the highest volcano in the Cascade Range. Its 
steep slopes are packed with vast amounts of potentially lethal ice and snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Rainier's largest known debris flow, 5,000 years ago, spread over 60 miles to 
bury the valley where Enumclaw, Buckley and other towns now stand. A flow of 
that magnitude would be catastrophic today. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot prevent volcanic activity," Dzurisin said, "but we can prepare for 
it and mitigate its effects." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike earthquakes, which usually strike without warning, volcanoes almost 
always send signals of impending trouble -- days, weeks, even months ahead of 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cascades Volcano Observatory, established during the Mt. St. Helens 
eruption, takes the pulse of these volcanoes. With a staff of 70 geologists, 
geophysicists, geochemists, hydrologists and cartographers, it is the largest 
of the Geological Survey's three such stations. The others are in Hawaii and 
Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 "We aren't able to intensively monitor all the volcanoes," Dzurisin admitted. 
"You might wait 100 years and not see anything at some of them." 
</P>
<P>
 The observatory concentrates on studying past eruptive behavior and on 
developing a "rapid response" capability for future emergencies. It also works 
with local officials on land-use planning and tries to educate the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not trying to scare people or force them to move away," said Dzurisin. 
"We just want them to be aware of the dangers and to prepare." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's absolutely gorgeous here. We'd never think of leaving," said Anita 
Glasco of Enumclaw, Wash., who has watched nine children and 36 grandchildren 
grow up in the shadow of Mt. Rainier. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you pay a price for your scenery. If an evacuation call comes, we'll pack 
up and head out." 
</P>
<P>
 But, like her neighbors, Glasco insists her family eventually would return and 
resume its uneasy relationship with the beautiful-but-belligerent Cascade 
volcanoes.

TAR HEELS STRUGGLE TO EXTEND STREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jerry Stackhouse scored a career-high 28 points and made several key plays 
down the stretch Saturday as No. 2 North Carolina escaped with a 96-92 victory 
over Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tar Heels, who won their 66th straight opener at home, trailed at halftime 
and through most of the second half until Stackhouse rallied his team, who 
could become No. 1 following top-ranked Arkansas' 104-80 loss to No. 3 
Massachusetts on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas, with three starters back from the team that was 26-8 last season, led 
for the final time at 87-86 with 4:18 left. Stackhouse then blocked a shot and 
got a return feed from fellow sophomore Rasheed Wallace for a dunk that gave 
the Tar Heels the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
 After Texas missed a 3-pointer, Stackhouse drove the baseline for a layup, 
then forced a turnover when he broke up an alley-oop pass on the Longhorns' 
next trip downcourt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tar Heels, who shot 59 percent in the second half, almost threw the ball 
away twice in the final 41 seconds after Texas cut the lead to 92-90, but the 
final pass ended up in the arms of Wallace under the basket. He made the layup 
with 32.2 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina's three sophomores combined for 66 points, with Wallace adding 
20 points and 13 rebounds and Jeff McInnis 18 points. Stackhouse's previous 
high was 23 points against LSU last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas, which shot 55.6 percent in the first half and forced 16 turnovers, got 
26 points from Terrence Rencher and 25 from Roderick Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina trailed 51-50 at halftime, but went on an 11-2 run to take a 
61-53 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Anderson and Rencher continued to hurt the Tar Heels with their 
outside quickness and penetrating ability. The Longhorns regained the lead with 
a 15-2 spurt as Rencher scored six and Anderson five. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina pulled to 81-81 with 5:59 left on a dunk by Donald Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas led by as many as nine points in the first half.

UCLA KEEPS PRESSURE ON AND CRUISES; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: BRUINS BUILD EARLY 
15-POINT LEAD IN OPENER AND ROLL OVER CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE, 83-60. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Getting the best out of its press, UCLA slammed and outmanned Cal State 
Northridge, then started thinking about Kentucky, its next opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressing all game long and expressing themselves with powerful dunks, the 
Bruins barreled to a 15-point lead and cruised to an 83-60 victory before 9,102 
at Pauley Pavilion on Saturday in the opener for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were a pretty dominating force," Matador Coach Pete Cassidy said. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, the Bruins did a good job of wiping away the memory of their 
sloppy one-point victory over Athletes In Action last Tuesday in their last 
exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins took advantage of their edge in size and strength, with seven-foot 
center George Zidek and 6-8 forward Ed O'Bannon scoring 13 quick points to help 
UCLA build a 24-9 lead before seven minutes had elapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Zidek made five of seven shots and led the Bruins with 14 points in only 20 
minutes. Sophomore forward Charles O'Bannon scored 13 points and his brother, 
Ed, scored 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Peter Micelli led Northridge with 17. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA outrebounded the Matadors, 44-28, but it was 22-10 in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the game, Bruin Coach Jim Harrick gave his four heralded freshmen 
plenty of minutes and kept up the full-court pressure, forcing Northridge into 
22 turnovers -- but also causing 22 UCLA turnovers in the high-octane 
atmosphere. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrick hinted that UCLA might utilize its speed, depth and quickness in next 
Saturday's game against Kentucky by pressing against the most famous pressing 
team in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of have a feeling we play a little bit better that way," Harrick said. 
"I don't think we're the kind of team that can press 40 minutes a game, but 
maybe we can. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you have to remember, pressing is a gamble, it's like going to Vegas." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior point guard Tyus Edney, a key part of the Bruins' pressure defense and 
offense, pointed to the quality minutes turned in by UCLA's backups and said he 
is all for stepping up the defensive aggressiveness even against teams like 
Kentucky. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA, Edney said, can go nine, 10 or 11 deep, which means fresh legs to chase 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of guys who can come in and just pick it up where the other 
guys left off and do real well," said Edney, who scored eight points and had 
five rebounds, four assists and three steals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It keeps us up-tempo, and we're an up-tempo type (of) team. It keeps the 
intensity real high." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ed O'Bannon: "When we pressed last year and when we've done it this year, 
it's worked pretty well. So let's keep it up, see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 The most impressive freshman Saturday -- and for most of the preseason too -- 
was 6-5 guard Toby Bailey, who made both of his three-point shots and scored 
nine points, including a monster dunk over Northridge center Shane O'Doherty, 
who is listed at 6-11. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey was rewarded for his play by starting the second half with the first 
team, which Bailey took as a potential sign of things to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Cameron Dollar started opposite Edney at guard, but Harrick might 
want to use Dollar as a seasoned leader of the reserves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Coach is considering me for that fifth starting spot," Bailey said. 
"He was giving me a little tryout. I think he wants me to just stay under 
control and play within the offense and play hard defense." 
</P>
<P>
 And the dunk? 
</P>
<P>
 "I just jumped as hard as I could," Bailey said. "When I jumped, I didn't 
expect to dunk it, but I was high enough and I decided in the air I could dunk 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ed O'Bannon and Edney, workhorses last season, said they looked forward to 
more rest this season watching Bailey, J.R. Henderson, Kris Johnson and omm'A 
Givens. In their debuts, Henderson had eight points and four rebounds, Johnson 
had four rebounds and Givens had five rebounds but missed all five of his 
shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrick played most of the freshmen together as a unit, as he had against AIA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it's helping me because my knees feel a whole lot better after the 
games now that I'm getting some rest," Ed O'Bannon said. "It's great to see 
them play together." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Edney: "It's fun to see the freshmen play with each other. I think they 
work well together. There's definitely no drop-off."

GATORS WRESTLED TO DRAW; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: FLORIDA STATE OVERCOMES 31-3 DEFICIT 
IN FOURTH QUARTER. BOWDEN TAKES THE SAFE WAY OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was football through the looking glass Saturday, when a 31-31 final score 
felt like a victory for Florida State and a bitter loss for Florida. That's 
what happens when you overcome a 28-point fourth-quarter lead . . . or waste 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 "We snatched a tie out of the jaws of defeat," Seminole Coach Bobby Bowden 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in a state of shock," Gator safety Lawrence Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 4-ranked Florida, which led, 31-3, with less than 13 minutes remaining, 
might need a whole team of therapists after this one. The Gators watched in 
disbelief as Florida State scored four consecutive fourth-quarter touchdowns, 
each one more numbing than the next. Then they had to sweat out the Seminoles' 
final drive, which reached the Florida 43-yard line before time -- and nearly 
the Gators -- expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, the Gators (9-1-1) walked quietly to their locker room, some of 
them grumbling about defensive coordinator Bob Pruett's second-half decision to 
switch from man-to-man coverage to a soft zone. Others flung their helmets to 
the ground in anger. Others searched out their Seminole counterparts and traded 
hugs. Florida center David Swain simply stood near midfield and stared at the 
Doak-Campbell Stadium scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were up 28 points," Swain said. "I couldn't conceive of losing this game 
or tying it." 
</P>
<P>
 The same goes for the Seminoles (9-1-1), who figured they were goners. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were down, 31-3, we just wanted to score some points to make this 
thing respectable so we could go to class on Monday," wide receiver 'OMar 
Ellison said. 
</P>
<P>
 From such humble aspirations came the comeback that tied the Division I-A 
fourth-quarter record, set by Washington State against Stanford in 1984. Of 
course, it didn't happen until the Seminoles junked their game plan, went to 
the no-huddle offense, put four wide receivers in the lineup and let the 
oft-criticized Danny Kanell throw until his arm or Florida dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Kanell, who has the unenviable timing of following Heisman Trophy winner 
Charlie Ward, responded with a fourth quarter for the ages. He completed 18 of 
22 passes for 232 yards, one touchdown and 14 first downs. He led the Seminoles 
on scoring drives of 84, 60, 73 and 60 yards during that final period, scored 
on a two-yard run and almost moved Florida State close enough for a last-second 
field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the stuff of Ward, if not better. In fact, Kanell, who finished with a 
school-record 40 completions in 53 attempts for 421 yards, said he probably 
quieted his detractors. "Until the next interception," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kanell smiled when he said it, but Bowden was this close to pulling the junior 
quarterback in favor of freshman Thad Busby. Then again, Bowden was thinking 
all sorts of dark thoughts early in the third quarter, when Florida was adding 
to its lead and the Seminoles were busy missing 30-yard field-goal attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 So complete was the Gators' dominance that Bowden glumly paced up and down the 
sideline and considered his postgame concession speech. His headphones were 
off, his mood as sour as freshly sliced lemons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, yeah, I can remember some things that went through my mind," Bowden said. 
"Like, 'I've never seen Florida that hot.' . . . 'They wanted it more than we 
did.' . . . 'They were physically whipping us in our back yard.' Yeah, I 
already had my answers." 
</P>
<P>
 But then Pruett started to play it safe and the Seminoles started taking 
chance after chance. "At that point, we had nothing to lose," Florida State 
offensive coordinator Mark Richt said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a record 80,210 watched from the stands, the Seminoles scored their first 
touchdown on Zack Crockett's five-yard run with 12:59 to play. Less than three 
minutes later, Kanell found Andre Cooper in the front corner of the end zone to 
cut the Florida lead to 31-17. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Florida couldn't do a thing. Three of the four final Gator 
possessions ended with a nice imitation of the June Taylor Dancers -- one, two, 
three, kick. The other one resulted in quarterback Danny Wuerffel's second 
interception of the day, a floater that sailed over the head of wide receiver 
Reidel Anthony and into the arms of a diving James Colzie, the fifth defensive 
back in the Seminoles' nickel package. 
</P>
<P>
 By then, Florida State had whittled the deficit to 31-24. The Seminoles had 
the ball at their 40, had 4:01 remaining and needed a touchdown, the quicker 
the better. Seven plays and 60 yards later, they had it, courtesy of tailback 
Rock Preston's four-yard run with 1:45 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the interesting part: Kick the extra point or go for two?. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowden thought about it. A lot. He had told Richt earlier in the quarter that 
if the Seminoles got within a touchdown, he wanted the final say on the 
conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 Fine, said Richt, who already had given Kanell the two-point play: a trap play 
up the middle, the same play Crockett had scored on. Kanell even told the 
offense to stay on the field after the fourth touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had the play called," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Didn't matter. Despite the gentle pleas of his assistant coaches, one of the 
biggest gamblers in the business decided to play it safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nine (assistants) and they get one vote apiece," Bowden said. "I get 
10." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as well, the Gators' Swain said. "The way things were going, they 
probably would have got it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one will know for sure. Out came Dan Mowrey, who punched the extra point 
through for the tie. The way Bowden figured it, let Florida Coach Steve 
Spurrier and Wuerffel work the Gators down the field in the final 1:45. Maybe 
the Gators make it, maybe they don't. Maybe they throw an interception, or 
fumble, or punt. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida started at its 16, but got no farther than the Gator 31. On the key 
third-and-four play, Seminole defensive end Derrick Alexander spun his way free 
and pressured Wuerffel just enough to force a quick pass. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Alexander would say the near-sack was something of a miracle, just like 
the Florida State comeback. Alexander suffered a hyper-extended left elbow 
midway through the first quarter and spent the rest of the game playing with 
one good arm. At times the pain was so intense that Alexander staggered to the 
sideline, threw down his helmet and fell to his knees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I can't move it," he said. "If I want to move it, I've got to move it 
with my hand." 
</P>
<P>
 But a day earlier, while watching the Thanksgiving Day game between the Dallas 
Cowboys and the Green Bay Packers, Alexander saw Packer defensive tackle Reggie 
White play with a heavily wrapped left elbow. It made an impression. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's what inspired me," Alexander said. "I think God put me in a 
position to watch that game, to see that you can play when you're hurt. If 
(White) can do it -- and he's one of the best -- why shouldn't I?" 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander still doesn't know how he did it. For that one key play, he somehow 
swung his left arm around, used a slap move on his would-be blocker and then 
spun toward Wuerffel, who rushed the throw. 
</P>
<P>
 And that was it for comebacks. Florida punted. Florida State ran out of time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never had a tie that felt so much like a win," Bowden said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's better than a loss," Spurrier said. 
</P>
<P>
 But not by much.

LAKERS TAKE STEP IN RIGHT DIRECTION; PRO BASKETBALL: VICTORY OVER BULLETS PUTS 
THEM TWO GAMES ABOVE .500 FOR FIRST TIME IN SINCE 1992-93 SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It might be minor success for the Lakers, but nobody with their recent past 
turns down a steppingstone.  
</P>
<P>
 The latest came Saturday night at USAir Arena, where not only did they beat 
the Washington Bullets, 112-96; not only did they win for the fourth time in a 
row and fifth in six games, and not only did they start the second East Coast 
swing of the opening month with back-to-back victories, they improved to 7-5. 
</P>
<P>
 The big deal is this: The Lakers are two games above .500 for the first time 
since March 21, 1993. For the first time in about a year and a half, after 
never getting better than one above last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long time," Sedale Threatt said. 
</P>
<P>
 To understand how long it has been on a team in transition, consider that only 
five players -- Elden Campbell, Vlade Divac, Anthony Peeler, Tony Smith and 
Threatt -- remain from that 1992-93 squad. Fittingly, most played a key role 
before 18,756, many of whom stayed to the end to boo the Bullets off the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell had 17 points and seven rebounds, four on offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Divac made only four of 15 shots, but had 12 rebounds and 11 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Threatt had 14 points in 19 minutes off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith made four of seven shots, including two of four three-point attempts. 
</P>
<P>
 Combine that with the contributions of the "newcomers" -- the 18 points and 14 
rebounds by Cedric Ceballos and the 22 points and 13 assists by Nick Van Exel 
-- and the Lakers' lead was at least 10 points the final 15 1/2 minutes. In 
that same time, they were up by as many as 19, at 89-70 late in the third 
quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're up right now," Coach Del Harris said. "Hopefully we can ride the 
crest. I hoped this trip would bring us together as a team. So far, it's moving 
in that direction." 
</P>
<P>
 The direction is up, in more ways than one. The Lakers are feeling good and 
now head north to play New Jersey on Tuesday before finishing the four-game 
trip the next night at Cleveland, a team they beat last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Team ball," said Van Exel, who broke the 20-point barrier for the fifth time 
in the 12 games. "The whole effort, at both ends of the court. Guys wanting it 
more." 
</P>
<P>
 So the improvement has been about attitude? 
</P>
<P>
 "Big-time attitude," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been other welcome additions along the way, most significantly of 
late the emergence of Smith as something more than a defensive weapon and 
Antonio Harvey as a factor at power forward. Saturday, Eddie Jones played the 
role of new arrival. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones never left, of course, but he had disappeared. Impressive on the 
four-game trip that started the season, he got flu soon after, and so did his 
game, with symptoms that included an achy jump shot. The illness went away, but 
the effects lingered, all the way to averaging only 4.8 points and shooting 
35.7% in 17.4 minutes the five previous outings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bullets proved to be the cure for Jones. Boosted by a strong first 
quarter, when he made four of six shots, including a three-pointer, and grabbed 
three rebounds, he finished with 15 points on seven-of-13 shooting, five 
rebounds and three steals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not back yet," Jones said afterward. "Coming, though." 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers as a whole know the feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Webber had 22 points and 20 rebounds for the Bullets, but was hardly a 
force on offense anywhere besides the boards. Almost all his points came on 
tip-ins as part of his seven offensive rebounds, slam dunks, and free throws. . 
. . Sam Bowie, at 33 a kid compared to some centers in the league, said he will 
probably retire after this season, his 11th, even though he is still good 
enough to draw interest from other teams if the Lakers decide not to re-sign 
him as an unrestricted free agent. "I still enjoy the game," he said. "(But) 
all the surgeries and injuries have really taken a toll on me. I guess next 
year would be a longshot for me." Bowie said he has made about $20 million as a 
pro since Portland passed on Michael Jordan to take him second overall in 1984, 
so he won't stick around only for a paycheck.

PLAYERS FEEL WIND DOWN TO THEIR SKINS; GOLF: EVERYONE STRUGGLES, BUT AZINGER 
AND STEWART SHARE LEAD AT $80,000 AFTER NINE HOLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of the world's finest golfers hit it on the rocks, over the green, off 
the fence post, under the bushes, through the cactus and sometimes even in the 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball traveled to many strange and varied destinations Saturday on the 
first day of the Skins Game, the unseemly result of persistent wind that gusted 
to 45 m.p.h. and turned Bighorn Golf Club into one long, hilly air tunnel. 
</P>
<P>
 All in all, it wasn't a particularly good day for golf. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Azinger thought it fell short of that. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was awful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, but it didn't turn out all that badly for him, because he won four 
skins and $80,000, the same amount Payne Stewart took with three skins. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Watson won $50,000 with two skins. Fred Couples was shut out but 
undaunted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got zero money, but I think I'm in good shape," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not a particularly good day to be a golf ball. Balls went so many 
places they needed passports. They could have used a few Band-Aids after all 
the rocks they hit. 
</P>
<P>
 There was Couples hitting downwind on No. 6, the ball striking a fence post on 
the fly, 430 yards from the tee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the only good shot I hit," Couples said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball wound up across a cart path in the sand among rocks and cactus, but 
he wound up with par. 
</P>
<P>
 There was Azinger on No. 7, his drive missing the fairway and landing in the 
desert, followed by a second shot that landed a few yards away in the sand 
under a bush. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was Stewart on No. 7, where he missed the green, the ball landing 
in the gallery on the other side of the ropes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You all were supposed to kick it over there," Stewart kidded the gallery, 
pointing to the hole. "If it had been Arnie, it would have been right down 
there now." 
</P>
<P>
 What happened on No. 5, a 280-yard par four, was typical. 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger's drive landed in a ditch to the right of the green with a bush in 
front of him. His chip failed to move the ball and he picked up. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples drove into the brush and took an unplayable lie. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart drove into the brush, chipped to the rough in front of the green, hit 
a wedge to seven feet and missed his par putt. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson drove the rough in front of the green, chipped to the fringe and 
two-putted for par, worth $20,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The wind not only changed directions and affected the balls in flight, but it 
also moved balls on the green after they already had stopped rolling. 
</P>
<P>
 Bighorn's elevated tees didn't help keep shots any straighter, either, because 
of the wind. 
</P>
<P>
 Couples drove out of bounds on No. 9, a $30,000 skin Watson claimed with a 
six-foot birdie putt. 
</P>
<P>
 Azinger got off to a flying start with a 15-foot birdie to win a $20,000 skin 
on the first hole. He holed a 50-foot bunker shot on No. 4 to win a $60,000 
skin after carryovers on the second and third holes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was relieved," Azinger said of his opening skin. "Last year was rough. My 
biggest fear was to come out here and not win a skin." 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart was shut out until No. 8, which was an $80,000 carryover skin. Stewart 
made a 20-foot putt for par, then Azinger, Couples and Watson all missed their 
par putts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think all three would miss," Stewart said. "But that's the Skins 
Game."

PENN STATE SCORES 59 TO MAKE A POINT; BIG TEN: NITTANY LIONS IMPRESSIVE AGAINST 
MICHIGAN STATE. CARTER RUSHES FOR 227 YARDS AND FIVE TOUCHDOWNS. 
</P>

<P>
 The chant started long before the end of Penn State's 59-31 victory over 
Michigan State on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 It started in the student section about eight minutes before Ki-Jana Carter 
iced the game with his fifth touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're No. 1! We're No. 1!" 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Paterno might stay out of the debate that will dominate college football 
from now until Jan. 2 and maybe longer, but the Penn State fans jumped into it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're a great football team," Paterno said. "I leave it up to you 
guys to tell the people how great." 
</P>
<P>
 No. 2-ranked Penn State, 11-0 overall and 8-0 in the Big Ten, finished the 
regular season with a perfect record for the seventh time in Paterno's coaching 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nittany Lions are headed to the Rose Bowl to play Oregon. Top-ranked 
Nebraska (11-0) will play in the Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 3 Alabama (11-0) will go to the Sugar Bowl if it beats Florida next 
Saturday for the Southeastern Conference championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Kerry Collins said Penn State would probably need some help to win 
the nationaltitle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's Nebraska's to lose right now, that's just the nature of the 
polls," hesaid. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, besides scoring five touchdowns, ran for 227 yards in 27 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 His fifth touchdown came on a 50-yard run with 4:44 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me I needed 23 yards to get 200, so I asked if I could stay in for 
one more series, and I just broke one," said Carter, who set a school record 
with his ninth 100-yard game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss was the last game for Michigan State Coach George Perles, who was 
forced to resign after 12 seasons with the Spartans. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to work at anything you do, and I'm going to work on having no 
bitterness, no envy, no jealousy and none of those bad things. . . . I'm going 
to shut them off," Perles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Michigan State (5-6, 4-4) used short passes and the running back tandem of 
Duane Goulbourne and Scott Greene to move the ball against the banged-up Penn 
State defense. The Spartans gained 417 yards and got a 100-yard kick return by 
Derrick Mason. 
</P>
<P>
 But Penn State had an answer for each Spartan score, and Carter controlled the 
second half, scoring three times in 14 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mason caught a 31-yard touchdown pass to give Michigan State an early 7-0 
lead, but Penn State came back with a six-yard touchdown run by Carter. 
</P>
<P>
 On Penn State's next possession, tailback Mike Archie hit Bobby Engram for a 
55-yard touchdown to make it 14-7. 
</P>
<P>
 On the ensuing kickoff, Mason got behind a wall of blockers and faked out 
kicker Brett Conway on a 100-yard score that tied the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State then came back to score on Brian Milne's one-yard dive. 
</P>
<P>
 After a Penn State field goal, Michigan State used Goulbourne and Greene to 
set up Chris Gardner's 23-yard field goal to cut the lead to 24-17 at the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Carter took over. He scored his fourth touchdown with 14:32 remaining to 
give Penn State a 45-24 cushion. 
</P>
<P>
 One play after a Michigan State fumble, Collins lobbed a long pass to Freddie 
Scott, who caught it on the run for a 56-yard touchdown to make it 52-24. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quarterbacks don't do these things by themselves," Collins said. "The 
offensive line has been unreal. Look at the sacks they didn't allow. Heck, in 
some of the games I didn't even get touched." 
</P>
<P>
 Paterno couldn't talk about Collins or Carter without mentioning the other. 
"If these two guys aren't the best at their positions, then I don't know who 
is," Paterno said. "These guys do things in tough games. They make things 
happen."

FINALLY, FRESNO ST. GETS A WIN; WAC: REGGIE BROWN SCORES FOUR TOUCHDOWNS TO 
LEAD BULLDOGS OVER SAN DIEGO STATE, 49-42.

 Reggie Brown ran for 161 yards and scored four touchdowns as Fresno State 
snapped a five-game losing streak Saturday night with a 49-42 victory over San 
Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs, 5-7-1 overall and 3-4-1 in the Western Athletic Conference, had 
not won a game since defeating Wyoming, 38-24, on Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, a junior from Detroit, scored on runs of three, 38 and eight yards and 
caught a four-yard touchdown pass from Richie Donati. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown played two seasons at College of the Desert in Palm Desert before 
transferring to Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego State (4-7, 2-6) trailed, 34-14, after three quarters, but pulled 
within 34-28 after a one-yard run by Wayne Pittman and a 22-yard pass play from 
Billy Blanton to Daryl Hawkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's 38-yard touchdown run came with 9:41 to play and gave the Bulldogs a 
40-28 lead, and Donati threw a two-point conversion pass to David Dunn. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego State closed to within 42-35 on a 38-yard touchdown pass play from 
Blanton to Will Blackwell with 7:24 remaining. But Brown iced the game with his 
eight-yard touchdown run with 2:53 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs took a 27-7 halftime lead on Brown's first two touchdowns, Jerome 
Oliver's six-yard touchdown run and field goals of 36 and 32 yards by Johan 
Lyssand. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Shearer scored San Diego State's lone touchdown of the half on a 
40-yard pass play. 
</P>
<P>
 Fresno's Donati, a star at Bishop Diego High in Santa Barbara who played 
behind Trent Dilfer last season, was 23 of 35 for 338 yards and one touchdown 
without an interception. He also rushed for one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanton, a sophomore from Mater Dei High in Santa Ana, was 30 of 39 for 447 
yards and one touchdown. He was intercepted twice. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittman rushed 30 times for 135 yards and two touchdowns for San Diego State. 
He also caught a two-yard touchdown pass from Blanton with 1:23 to play.

 J.J. Smith rushed for 227 yards and two touchdowns in 34 carries and 
quarterback Chad May ran for two scores as No. 11 Kansas State routed Nevada 
Las Vegas, 42-3, Saturday at Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 May was eight of 13 for 126 yards and a touchdown despite winds gusting to 40 
m.p.h. in the regular-season finale for the Aloha Bowl-bound Wildcats (9-2). 
</P>
<P>
 UNLV (6-5) will play Central Michigan in the Las Vegas Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 After leading, 21-3, at halftime, Kansas State put the game away with two 
quick scores early in the third period. Smith, who had a 29-yard touchdown run 
in the second quarter, ran 13 yards for a score that gave the Wildcats a 28-3 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Rice 31, Houston 13 -- Freshman quarterback Chad Nelson ran for one touchdown 
and one of his two completions went for a score as the Owls (5-6, 4-3) won at 
Houston to earn a share of the Southwest Conference football title for the 
first time since 1957. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson's 23-yard touchdown pass to Jeff Venghaus in the third quarter gave the 
Owls a 21-7 lead and the Cougars (1-10, 0-6-1) couldn't recover. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory put the Owls into an unprecedented five-way share of the league 
title with Texas, Baylor, Texas Christian and Cotton Bowl-bound Texas Tech, all 
with 4-3 records. 
</P>
<P>
 There were three-way ties for the SWC title in 1959 (Arkansas, Texas, TCU) and 
1975 (Arkansas, Texas and Texas A&M). 
</P>
<P>
 Louisville 34, Tulsa 27 -- Marty Lowe scored on a one-yard run with less than 
two minutes remaining and Anthony Shelman rushed for a career-best 220 yards in 
36 carries as the Cardinals (6-5) won at Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
 Tulsa (3-8) trailed, 21-3, in the first half but a 29-yard field goal by James 
Anderson tied the game at 27-27 with 6:51 left before Louisville drove to the 
decisive touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern 34, Grambling State 7 -- Touchdowns on three first-half interceptions 
-- two by linebacker Jimmy Conner -- keyed the Jaguars' victory over the Tigers 
in the Bayou Classic at New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southwestern Athletic Conference victory for Southern (6-5, 5-2) was only 
its eighth in the 21 Bayou Classics. The loss by Grambling (9-2, 6-1) knocked 
the Tigers, already assured a Heritage Bowl berth, into a first-place tie with 
Alcorn State in the final SWAC standings.

 Jamie Howard passed for touchdowns on plays of 47 and 34 yards in the fourth 
quarter and Louisiana State ended the Curley Hallman regime with a 30-12 
victory over Arkansas on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 On the first play of the fourth quarter, Howard hooked up with Brett Bech on a 
47-yard touchdown pass play that made the score 16-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Bech caught the ball at the 30 and split Dean Peevy and Mike Nunnerly. Peevy 
and Nunnerly were victimized minutes later when Howard passed down the right 
sideline and Sheddrick Wilson made a diving catch in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard completed 14 of 24 passes for 223 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Hallman was fired before LSU's victory over Tulane on Nov. 19. The Tigers, 4-7 
overall and 3-5 in the Southeastern Conference, were 16-28 during Hallman's 
four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkansas (4-7, 2-6) took a tying field goal off the board in the second 
quarter and failed to score on a 79-yard drive in the third quarter. The 
Razorbacks failed to convert on fourth and one at the LSU 11.

SHERRILL'S BULLDOGS RULE STATE; SEC: RUNNING OF SENIORS BOUIE AND DAVIS LEADS 
MISSISSIPPI STATE OVER MISSISSIPPI, 21-17. 
</P>

<P>
 With two bruising 6-foot-1, 220-pound running backs, Coach Jackie Sherrill had 
no problem determining No. 19 Mississippi State's game plan against 
Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt if we could keep the contest a muscle game instead of a finesse game 
then we would have a strong chance of winning," Sherrill said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ball was handed play after play to seniors Kevin Bouie and Michael Davis, 
who combined for 280 yards as State beat Ole Miss, 21-17, Saturday in the fog 
at Vaught-Hemingway Stadium in Oxford, Miss. 
</P>
<P>
 Bouie ran 27 times for 141 yards and scored twice on one-yard runs. Davis had 
24 carries and 139 yards and a four-yard touchdown run in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both of their backs were great players and both should be in the pros," said 
Ole Miss interim coach Joe Lee Dunn, who also is the defensive coordinator. 
"That is the best team that Mississippi State has had since I've been here." 
</P>
<P>
 Mississippi State, 8-3 overall and 5-3 in the Southeastern Conference, is 
assured its third bowl game in four seasons under Sherrill. The Bulldogs are 
likely headed to the Peach or Gator. 
</P>
<P>
 Ole Miss (4-7, 2-6), placed on four years' NCAA probation a week prior to the 
State game, lost six of its last eight games. 
</P>
<P>
 All the points were scored in the second quarter when the teams traded scores 
on seven possessions in a row.

 HANUKKAH LIGHTS: Renewed debate over a proposed school prayer amendment has 
sparked concern among Orange County Jews, who observe the start tonight of 
Hanukkah, the Festival of Lights. . . . Rabbi Bernie King of Irvine's 
Congregation Shir Ha-Ma'alot is also uncomfortable with seasonal religious 
observances in public schools, "unless you include all the winter celebrations 
-- then you can have very rich public school experience that's pluralistic and 
involves everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 MAKING WAVES: Some may say Only in California , but a group of wetlands 
preservationists plan to put their surfboards on the line for their 
cause.Surfrider Foundation will join a Dec. 10 protest along Pacific Coast 
Highway in Huntington Beach. Members are against the Koll Real Estate Group's 
major housing development proposal for a section of wetlands there. . . . 
Hundreds are expected to line PCH with their surfboards -- not to block 
traffic, but to demonstrate against the Koll project. County supervisors are 
expected to consider it next month. 
</P>
<P>
 LINE OF FIRE: Republican victories in the Nov. 8 election have conservative 
columnists gleefully boasting about political changes they foresee. Among them: 
the urbane, erudite William F. Buckley, syndicated columnist, author and host 
of TV's "Firing Line." And he's found a sympathetic audience in Orange County 
for his thoughts. Buckley is scheduled to speak Thursday night at the National 
Assn. of Industrial and Office Properties meeting at the Hyatt Regency Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 NOBLE CAUSE: Few know more about books than the people at Barnes & Noble. 
They're helping build a library for Children's Hospital of Orange County. Drop 
off used books for young people at its six local bookstores -- or Bookstar 
stores in Brea and Tustin -- and they'll see that they go into the new hospital 
library. . . . Once established, CHOC plans a program of trained volunteers to 
read to the children in their hospital rooms.

CHESS; ALL HAIL GATA KAMSKY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK PETERS, INTERNATIONAL MASTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gata Kamsky of New York has had a spectacular year, highlighted by four 
victories in world championship qualifying matches. The latest rating list 
issued by the Professional Chess Assn.(PCA) takes into account Kamsky's 5 1/2-1 
1/2 mauling of English grandmaster Nigel Short in September. The PCA now ranks 
the 20-year-old Kamsky third in the world at 2741, behind only PCA world 
champion Garry Kasparov (2813) and World Chess Federation (FIDE) champion 
Anatoly Karpov (2758). 
</P>
<P>
 No American has ranked in the top five since Bobby Fischer went into seclusion 
after winning the 1972 world championship. Kamsky has opened a wide gap over 
his contemporaries. The next Americans on the PCA list are Gregory Kaidanov of 
Kentucky (2618) and 1994 U.S. champion Boris Gulko of New Jersey (2617). 
</P>
<P>
 Kamsky will oppose Valery Salov of Spain, ranked sixth at 2699, in a 
FIDE-sponsored match early next year to determine an official challenger to 
Karpov in the 1995 FIDE world championship. Tentative plans call for him to 
play Viswanathan Anand of India (fourth at 2738) in the PCA challenger's final 
in Las Palmas in the Canary Islands next March. Kamsky edged Anand in a 
thrilling match conducted by FIDE in July.

ETHICS MISSING FROM CADAVER CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The well-written article "Bodies of Knowledge," (Nov. 15) seeks to interest 
readers in a "cadaver prosection class" offered at Orange Coast College. (You) 
list as requirements for enrollment in the class "a certain instinct and drive 
to learn about the human body."An academic prerequisite is a five-hour anatomy 
class. 
</P>
<P>
 Why is mention not made of the need for sensitive instruction on medical 
ethics to include the ethics of cadaver study and a respect for the deceased? 
Sensitivity is necessary to respect the wishes of those whose bodies are 
donated either by themselves or their families. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent article in the school newspaper describes the same class and makes 
light and flippant mention of the cadaver's nicknames to which (you) refer. In 
defense of this breach of medical ethics, Prof. Ann Harmer states that the 
school reporter got the information from student interviews. Therein lies the 
problem.  
</P>
<P>
 The students have not been indoctrinated with the necessary ethics to which 
they should have been exposed before having the privilege of cadaver research. 
Further evidence of the carnival atmosphere of the class is the description of 
a door opened to curiosity viewers. Can't proper ventilation be provided 
without the curious seeing these bodies being dissected?

VALLEY COLLEGE ALSO HAS INTERIOR DESIGN PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I would like to set the record straight regarding the statement, quoted in a 
recent news story, by the director of L.A. Mission College's newly created 
interior design department that, "Mission has the only complete interior design 
program in the Los Angeles Community College District." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Valley College has offered an interior design certificate program 
for the past 20 years.The Family and Consumer Studies Department at Valley 
College has issued more interior design certificates that any other accredited 
educational institution in the San Fernando Valley. Mission and Valley colleges 
are part of the same Los Angeles Community College District.

A LESSON IN CONTROLLING ONE'S DESTINY; LAKE FOREST MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS 
MARSHAL RESOURCES TOWARD LONG-TERM SECURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A number of communities in Orange County have wrestled with rising rents at 
mobile home parks. For those on fixed incomes, increases can squeeze an already 
tight budget or prompt longtime residents to pick up and move elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 For many senior citizens, these are not happy stories. But a group of 
residents in Lake Forest has turned this issue to their favor by working 
together and with federal housing officials. Residents of the Kimberly Gardens 
Mobile Home Estates negotiated to buy their 150-space park after a long battle 
with their landlord and the City Council over rent stability. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimberly Gardens was one of four mobile home parks in the city that battled 
for several years to get a rent control law passed. But rent control did not 
pass muster with the City Council, which turned it down by one vote. The 
residents did not give up, and turned their battle into a determined push for 
self-determination. 
</P>
<P>
 Working with federal Housing and Urban Development authorities, and with the 
park leaseholder, the residents managed to come up with financing for a 
$6-million takeover of the park. The federal government helped come up with 30% 
of the purchase price. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost half the park's population was made up of senior citizens. The 
residents were in a particular bind because so many were on fixed incomes. One 
resident said that for some, the question became whether to buy medicine or to 
pay the rent. The purchase, he said, meant that "We can now control our own 
destiny." 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase was the result of lobbying of city, county, state and federal 
authorities for assistance in financing a loan to purchase the 30-year-lease on 
their property. After several tense years, these residents have shown how it is 
possible to take charge of their own destinies and to invest in securing their 
own futures.

TIME FOR THE DELEGATION TO STEP FORWARD; IT'S A NEW ERA -- LET'S HOPE OUR 
CONGRESSMEN USE THEIR INFLUENCE TO BENEFIT O.C. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 These ought to be the best of times for an Orange County congressional 
delegation used to minority status. A Times Orange County Poll conducted before 
the election found that almost two out of three respondents could not name any 
of this group, and only a very small percentage believed it had "a lot of 
influence." 
</P>
<P>
 In general, voters also were found to be frustrated with Washington politics 
in general, showering equal blame on Republicans, Democrats and President 
Clinton for gridlock at the federal level. That was before the strong 
Republican tide swept ashore in the Nov. 8 election. Suddenly, this largely 
anonymous six-member Orange County delegation was in the majority party, flush 
with success. 
</P>
<P>
 What will they make of their newfound visibility, and would a similar survey 
taken a year into the reign of likely House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) find 
any more familiarity with the work of this group? 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County is one of the most dominant Republican landscapes. Almost 
everybody with presidential aspirations passes this way at one time or other. A 
stronghold of Republican strength would figure to have a measure of influence. 
Certainly, this group has paid its dues politically even if it is short on 
seniority. Rep. Robert K. Dornan of Garden Grove, for example, was the most 
loyal of troopers for former President George Bush. 
</P>
<P>
 While many are unfamiliar with the delegation, the people who do go to the 
polls regularly have returned these incumbents, and done so despite some of 
their more extreme positions or statements. Certainly, given the importance of 
Orange County in the Republican universe, the leadership ought to find 
meaningful places for these representatives. This, in turn, would benefit 
Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 The local congressmen currently are lining up with the others, looking for the 
top assignments. Rep. Christopher Cox, certainly the most respected, is a 
likely chairman of the subcommittee on commerce, consumer and monetary affairs 
of the Committee on Government Operations. He ought to be a leader. Dornan, 
always outspoken, lost seniority when he moved from his former Santa Monica 
district to Orange County. Still, if he could land the chair of an armed 
services subcommittee he could be in a position to put talk aside and really do 
something significant for, say, the future of the El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, the changed dynamics in the Congress are likely to pose a host of 
fresh tests for the delegation. In a suddenly different era, let's see what 
they can do for Orange County.

FACING UP TO THREAT OF JAIL OVERCROWDING; GRAND JURY'S CALL FOR NEW FACILITIES 
IS TIMELY, PRUDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Grand Jury has provided a needed public service with its 
recommendation that two jails be built next to existing jails in Santa Ana and 
Irvine.  
</P>
<P>
 Although two county officials again demonstrated an unfortunate 
head-in-the-sand reaction to this latest reminder of the problem of jail 
overcrowding, the grand jury was right to raise the issue. The jurors can only 
recommend. It is the five supervisors who can start the shovels turning. Lately 
they have seldom discussed the issue, let alone tried to start building a new 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
 This month's report by the grand jurors brought a quick response from County 
Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider, who said that because the county did 
not have the funds to build or operate a new jail, there was no reason to upset 
people in Santa Ana and Irvine. Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez reminded people 
that an attempt to get voters to approve a tax for jail construction three 
years ago failed by a large margin. 
</P>
<P>
 However, since that proposed tax was defeated, the question of a new jail has 
been avoided. The county did reach a welcome tentative agreement last week with 
the city of Orange to increase the number of beds at the Theo Lacy Branch Jail 
in Orange by an additional 1,660 beds. County officials also have turned away 
inmates from other jurisdictions they previously housed temporarily and have 
encouraged cities to build jails of their own. Both were smart moves. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet far more is needed, unless the county is willing to continue releasing 
tens of thousands of inmates each year before their terms are up. Thousands 
more continue not to be admitted for lack of space. Sheriff Brad Gates told the 
supervisors in August that in the past two years he has been forced to give 
early releases to nearly 55,000 inmates. The cells were needed for inmates 
considered a higher risk to the community. In many cases, men and women 
arrested for relatively minor crimes, but who a decade ago would have been 
jailed to await trial, are given summonses telling them when to appear in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters may believe they got tough on crime earlier this month by passing the 
"three strikes" initiative, which will increase prison time for second 
offenders and put those convicted of three serious or violent crimes behind 
bars for 25 years to life. As a practical matter, criminals in Orange County 
must first spend time in the County Jail, awaiting trial or a plea of guilty. 
Officials predicted that felons are more likely to opt for trial due to "three 
strikes," which means they will be in jail longer. Thus other inmates will 
leave early in still greater numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Schneider and Vasquez were right in citing the county's lack of money 
for new jails, voters eventually are going to have to decide what they will pay 
for in order to get tough on crime. The grand jury estimated the construction 
cost of each 3,000-bed jail, to serve medium- and maximum-security inmates, at 
$300 million. The voters last time rejected a proposed jail in Gypsum Canyon. 
Building new jails next to existing ones is one way to go; it would reduce 
opposition, because it would not involve outraging a new group of residents 
fearful of a jail. There would still be opposition, but voters must at least 
understand the alternatives: Build the cells or let inmates out early. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas F. Riley, who is stepping down in January after 20 years as a 
supervisor, made a fine gesture in offering to vote for a jail siting before 
his successor takes office, sparing her the political heat. Supervisor Harriett 
M. Wieder, who is also leaving the board, should consider joining in an act of 
political resolve.

AMIGOS DE BOLSA CHICA SUPPORTS PREPAREDNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Amigos de Bolsa Chica would like to set the record straight with regards 
to Bruce Monroe's letter (Nov. 13) regarding my statements in The Times on Oct. 
25. 
</P>
<P>
 He concludes from the article that the Amigos de Bolsa Chica support some form 
of development at Bolsa Chica, and that the Amigos have "compromised the 
public's wishes and that of many of their members" regarding issues at Bolsa 
Chica. This is incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
 Not being present at the meeting, Bruce couldn't know that the Amigos began by 
stating their support of a land swap at Bolsa Chica. Obviously, a land swap 
would preclude development. 
</P>
<P>
 He asserts that my comments to the council, accurately reported by The Times, 
indicate the Amigos support development. Our comments were simply meant to 
encourage the City Council to consider examining an alternative to a 
biodiversity park -- which at that time was the only option they had prepared 
on Bolsa Chica. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the county is working on a plan for development at Bolsa Chica, the 
Amigos felt it would be wise for the city to prepare a plan that dealt with 
that. His conclusion that this means the Amigos support development is 
fallacious. The Amigos believe the city needs a plan that considers 
development, should it occur. This doesn't imply we are advocating development 
-- just being prepared for it. Following my comments, the council did arrive at 
a plan that addresses development. 
</P>
<P>
 The Amigos have consistently spoken for the protection of wetlands areas at 
Bolsa Chica, the design, planning and implementation of the highest quality 
restoration for the wetlands and community involvement in the planning process 
that determines what happens with the rest of the Bolsa Chica area -- the area 
not preserved by the agreement the Amigos negotiated with the landowner. 
</P>

 President, Amigos de Bolsa Chica

<P>
 * In a letter (Nov. 13), Pam Julien, president of the Bolsa Chica Alliance, 
suggests that the tidal inlet proposed as part of the Bolsa Chica Alliance 
development will have a favorable impact on the erosion of the Huntington 
Cliffs and the adjacent beach. This suggestion is directly contradicted by the 
environmental impact report.  
</P>
<P>
 The EIR, in the section on coastal hydraulics, predicts: "Accruing sediment 
trapped in the full tidal area will eventually reduce habitat significantly, 
reduce efficiency of the tidal flow to the muted tidal areas, and possibly plug 
up the inlet itself. The shoreline immediately north of the tidal inlet will 
erode approximately 20 feet at the end of 10 years reducing usable beach area 
for potential recreation." Further, "the shoreline immediately south of the 
tidal inlet will erode about 13 feet after five years then undergo accretion 
leaving about six feet of erosion at the end of Year 10." And finally, 
"Shoreline erosion will occur at Huntington Cliffs." 
</P>
<P>
 Local taxpayers, who will most likely pay for mitigation of these effects, 
need to be aware of such hidden costs in the proposals. The debate over the 
three proposals for development of the Bolsa Chica Wetlands should be based on 
accurate data and predictions. Take time to read the EIR.

A COUNTRY TIRED OF DEMOCRATS GIVES GOP ITS TURN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re: Sarah L. Catz's, "Republicans Get a Chance to Prove That It's Been the 
Democrats' Fault," (Nov. 20). Nice try, Ms. Catz, but no cigars when you state: 
"I sincerely believe you (the Republicans) only have two years to prove 
yourselves. I hope you don't mess it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, just how many years under a Democrat-controlled Congress has it taken to 
get us into the mess we face? 
</P>
<P>
 All of our troubles have been cumulative and have been brought about chiefly 
because of the misuse of power and the misuse of money, which Congress has been 
given by the American people to spend wisely. 
</P>
<P>
 I ask, who do you think you are to place a timetable on how long it will take 
to right our national ship, which has been plagued with irresponsibility at the 
congressional and state levels? No one really knows how long it will take. Stop 
insulting intelligent people! 
</P>
<P>
 And, as Catz states, "start dealing with issues and combine your pragmatism 
with thoughtfulness." I believe that their "contract with America" deals with 
the issues that are responsible and important. As for her comment about 
ensuring a Democratic majority for the next 40 years if the next two years are 
"wasted" -- what utter nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of objectivity in Catz's words are indicative of one reason the 
Democratic Party has lost credibility. Perhaps she is gaining her insights with 
a crystal ball that none of us possess.

 * Gee whiz! Golly, gee whiz!! It was so nice reading that Mark Petracca really 
had the gall to tell the GOP that it had to change its policies and not the 
other way around ("The GOP Must Change Its Politics," Nov. 20). Most other 
analysts, astute ones however, seemed to think the recent deluge of elected 
Republicans was a repudiation of the current 
big-government-running-your-life-for-you approach. Many of us are tired of the 
"I'll show you how to take your money and how to spend it for you" attitude of 
FDR, Lyndon Johnson, the current liberal and her husband, Bill, and many of the 
GOP that have voted with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Directly above Petracca's article is a piece by an officer of the Democratic 
Foundation of Orange County telling the Republicans that "we need 
consensus-building, not name-calling. We are so, so tired of name-calling. (OK, 
Newt?)" (and presumably Shrillary, and maybe even Petracca). 
</P>
<P>
 However, wide-of-the-Mark has to tell us it is the GOP (and not also the 
Dems?) that has "eschewed compromise, emphasized obstruction and encouraged 
rhetorical bombast." This is a classic example of the kettle calling the pot 
black. Petracca must have a graduate degree in Myopia from the Bill Press 
School of Shaded California Journalism. A political scientist should be able to 
tell the difference between anyone criticizing individual leaders of Congress, 
and supposedly spending 40 years "denigrating" the institution itself. Calling 
critics "bombastic" is intellectually insulting to those who are not of his 
ilk. How condescending. 
</P>
<P>
 Petracca is a liberal fundamentalist whose word is gospel, and not to be 
questioned. Come on Professor, you and the liberals lost fair and square. Be a 
winner, not a whiner. Remember, in political commentary, it all depends upon 
whose ox is getting gored. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's not the GOP that faces going back "into the wilderness" two years 
from now. It might be Bill and his crew.

REDEVELOPMENT'S THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; PROPERTY TAX PLAN IS ESSENTIAL TO AIDING 
QUAKE-RAVAGED SECTIONS OF THE VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 San Francisco turned to the redevelopment process in its efforts to recover 
and rebuild after the Loma Prieta earthquake. The cities of San Fernando and 
Santa Monica did the same after the Northridge earthquake. So, too, did Santa 
Clarita, although the attempt there has been marred by conflicts over the 
project's cost and size. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of these jurisdictions used emergency provisions in the state's 
redevelopment law to set up specific recovery areas in hard-hit disaster zones. 
Under the law, local redevelopment agencies keep all of the property tax 
generated by new construction in the area, then use that money to provide 
residential and commercial loans to fund rebuilding and recovery efforts. Bonds 
can also be floated for the same purpose. It's a fine idea that can fill gaps 
in federal and state aid. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, trying to establish such zones in Los Angeles has proven to be 
almost as volatile an issue as it was in Santa Clarita. Dozens of angry 
residents showed up at public hearings to protest such a zone in quake-ravaged 
Sherman Oaks and Studio City. Much of the fear and distrust here revolved 
around the city's Community Redevelopment Agency and its power to spend tax 
dollars and authority to condemn property through the use of eminent domain. 
</P>
<P>
 Those concerns led 5th District council member Zev Yaroslavsky to restrict the 
redevelopment tool to the rebuilding of condominiums only for a period of at 
least 11 months. The City Council voted 12 to 0 to establish the zone with that 
and other restrictions, and it was good that the council at least managed to do 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the restrictions and the powers bestowed upon a citizens advisory 
committee (it can vote to oppose elements of the plan and its wishes can be 
superseded only by a two-thirds vote of the City Council), opposition to the 
redevelopment plan is still strong. 
</P>
<P>
 We don't think the protests over the redevelopment process are warranted. To 
put it bluntly, it will provide Sherman Oaks and Studio City with funds to aid 
their recoveries. The objections should stop.

THE REAL BUZZ ON HELICOPTER NOISE; IT MAY BE A NUISANCE, BUT IT'S NOT AN FAA 
SAFETY ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The list of those seeking a 1,000-foot minimum altitude for non-emergency 
helicopter flights over populated areas near Van Nuys Airport now reads like 
"Who's Who in Local Politics." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Richard Riordan, for example, threw his hat into the ring recently when 
he wrote the following in a letter to the Federal Aviation Administration: "The 
City of Los Angeles consistently receives complaints by residents who are 
awakened and disturbed by both early morning and low-altitude sight-seeing 
flights. In some instances, these interruptions make it impossible for 
residents to perform their normal daily activities." 
</P>
<P>
 The issue in terms of complaints, therefore, is one of noise and its 
associated irritations. And the list of those politicians who have gotten an 
earful of it from constituents include U.S. Reps. Anthony C. Beilenson, Howard 
L. Berman, and Henry A. Waxman; state Sens. Herschel Rosenthal, Tom Hayden, 
Ralph Dills, and David A. Roberti; Assembly members Burt Margolin, Barbara 
Friedman, Terry B. Friedman, and Richard Katz, and Los Angeles City Council 
members Joel Wachs, Marvin Braude, and Laura Chick; as well as Council 
President John Ferraro and Supervisor-elect Zev Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the aforementioned public servants are on the passenger list for the 
1,000-foot minimum requirement. 
</P>
<P>
 There's just one slight problem. The FAA doesn't alter flight patterns purely 
because of noise. If the elected officials don't know this, we're going to do a 
little explaining. If they do know this, then the time they are wasting with 
these letters ought to be a little irritating to those constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, there is no altitude minimum for helicopters flying over populated 
areas from Van Nuys. Why? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, according to the FAA experts who do a commendable job of traffic control 
in our crowded skies, it's because the helicopters are more maneuverable. If 
their pilots get into trouble at a low altitude, they can land safely much more 
easily than the fixed-wing aircraft, which do have to conform to a 1,000-foot 
minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Airport conducts both general aviation and corporate jet activity, 
and it is an intensely busy enterprise, with about 550,000 aircraft operations 
annually. Part of what makes it all work safely is the fact that the helicopter 
traffic is generally at the lower altitudes. Requiring a 1,000-foot minimum 
altitude for certain helicopter flights "could create congestion," with the 
fixed-wing aircraft near the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, that could become a safety issue, and that is what usually matters 
to the FAA. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't consider noise a safety issue. Safety is what the FAA gets involved 
with," said one high ranking, locally based FAA official. 
</P>
<P>
 Petitioning or letter-writing to the FAA on noise grounds alone, therefore, 
figures not to matter very much. In that respect, it is similar to the 
complaints about the takeoff routes from Burbank Airport. Those routes have 
nothing to to do with whose neighborhood gets buzzed, and everything to do with 
a short runway, prevailing winds, and the fact that it would be nice to not 
have planes crashing into the Verdugo Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Lowering the noise levels is a reasonable goal, but minimum flight height 
requirements probably aren't the way to go about it.

CLOSING TEEN CENTERS SENDS WRONG MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your story "Lack of Support Closes Teen Center" (Nov. 12) is the last straw! 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers want a place where they are comfortable to be themselves -- where 
they have people to talk to who will understand and be there for them.They need 
a place just to hang out. What message are these young people receiving when we 
give them what they want and then take it away? 
</P>
<P>
 Undeniably, crime is a problem in Los Angeles. After I'd moved to Studio City 
two months ago, I was walking down Ventura Boulevard with two friends at 
approximately 9:30 p.m. and we were egged by a car full of teen-agers! This was 
my "Welcome to Los Angeles. This is your home now." I feel that I should be 
able to walk around in my neighborhood without threat to my safety. Maybe if 
these kids had some place to go, my friends and I wouldn't have been bombarded. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope the newly reelected Gov. Pete Wilson will pay attention to the fact 
that helpful centers, such as the one in Glendale, are losing their funding and 
being shut down. There are a lot of kids who teeter on the border of doing the 
wrong thing and these centers give them a push in the right direction. If Gov. 
Wilson wants to control crime, then he better invest some money in our youth.

KEEP CRA OUT OF SHERMAN OAKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The proposal to declare a community redevelopment agency for the Sherman Oaks 
community is a very troubling one with potentially long-term, devastating 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 As a 30-year resident of the Valley with a long history of activism in the 
community and someone who lost her home in the earthquake, I feel it is 
imperative that I take a strong public stance in opposition to the current 
proposals for a CRA in Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 My rationale is not dissimilar to that expressed by local homeowners and 
business groups. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no question but that public confidence and trust in the CRA are at a 
well-deserved low (grand jury report, July, 1994). Once a CRA is declared, the 
agency can wield extraordinary powers over property and citizenry with virtual 
autonomy. The community sacrifices any real veto powers. The usual requirements 
for environmental impact reports on planned developments are summarily waived, 
putting the long-term health of the community in jeopardy. Powers of eminent 
domain can be exercised unopposed. And perhaps most threatening of all, there 
is no sunset clause for CRA power, resulting in the possibility that Sherman 
Oaks will be under the heel of a CRA dictatorship for the foreseeable future. 
</P>
<P>
 The myth that CRA monies are a gift is just that -- a myth. There is still no 
such thing as a free lunch. Although sources of revenue for repayment are 
generally glossed over in debate, the day of reckoning will arrive. "They" say 
that invocation of the CRA for emergencies is different, that the unchecked 
authority is not as universal as it ordinarily would be. I have yet to see any 
definitive proof that this is so. 
</P>
<P>
 The only hope for a system of checks and balances with respect to a CRA in 
Sherman Oaks rests in oversight from the City Council and a citizens group with 
real veto power. Until the 5th District seat is filled in July, greater 
irreparable harm to an already beleaguered neighborhood is a distinct 
possibility. I say Sherman Oaks has suffered enough. We have already waited 10 
long months for intervention. It is better to wait another few months than to 
pay indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 CRA -- go away!

SYBERT'S LEGAL FEES RAISE ETHICS QUESTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In The Times' article "Charges and Countercharges as Vote Nears" (Nov. 4), 
Tony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) says that Richard Sybert made $140,600 in 
legal fees during the first 11 months of 1993 although he was working full time 
for California at an annual salary of $98,825 paid by us taxpayers.  
</P>
<P>
 Now the arithmetic.Sybert says he charges his clients $200 per hour. If we 
divide $140,600 by $200 we find that Sybert worked 703 hours for private 
clients in the 11 months or, using an eight-hour day, he worked 88 days. Now if 
we assume a five-day work week with just two holidays, that comes to 18 weeks. 
Said another way, according to Sybert's own figures, he worked for private 
clients well over four months out of the first 11 months when he was being paid 
$98,825 annually by us taxpayers. Further, according to Sybert, that is not 
unethical. 
</P>
<P>
 If he is correct, the ethical standards for California's employees are 
seriously in need of revision.

QUAKE MAY HAVE SPRUNG DEADLY LEAKS; WITH COLDER WEATHER HERE, CHECKING HOME'S 
GAS HEATING SYSTEM MAY PREVENT A TRAGEDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Statistics vary on the number of people who are killed each year by carbon 
monoxide gas, which is acutely dangerous because it is both odorless and 
colorless. A highly reliable source of such information, however, is the 
federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. On average, the 
CDC says, about 14 people a day die from carbon monoxide poisoning in the 
United States. As many as one-third of those fatalities are accidental, and 
mostly preventable. 
</P>
<P>
 Former tennis star Vitas Gerulaitis died in such fashion in September, from a 
lethal carbon monoxide buildup related to the faulty installation of a propane 
heater. Times columnist Ron Galperin also noted the tragedy of the Marshall 
family, in Pasadena, who suffered from what appeared to be flu-like symptoms 
that grew steadily more severe. Eventually, their 10-year-old son died in his 
sleep. The cause: carbon monoxide emanations from a faulty wall furnace. And, 
in a separate case, a 7-month-old San Fernando baby recently had to be treated 
for carbon monoxide poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter case brings us to the point of local concern here: the San Fernando 
infant lived in a home where at least one vent was cracked because of the 
Northridge earthquake. Now that colder temperatures have arrived, we have a 
suggestion: Whether your home was severely damaged or escaped with only minor 
problems, it is worth the time and effort to have your heating system checked 
for cracks or faulty vent connections. Dust or soot that may have been shaken 
loose by the quake and its aftershocks may also be a problem if enough of it 
has accumulated in the vents to cause complete combustion. 
</P>
<P>
 The case of the rescued San Fernando baby "is an example of the types of 
things we are concerned about" after the temblor, said Gas Co. spokesperson 
Michelle Bagley. 
</P>
<P>
 Checking the color of your heating system's pilot light is one way to proceed. 
Things are fine if your flame is a steady blue cone. Things aren't fine if the 
flame is orange or yellow and burns high and erratically. And if you're feeling 
healthy, but experience nausea, dizziness or headaches after you've fired up 
the home heater, turn it off, open the windows, get out of the house, and call 
the gas company. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have any reason to doubt the integrity of your heating system, it's 
worth the peace of mind you'll get from calling the gas company at (800) 
427-2200 for a free home inspection. We don't need any more tragedies from that 
earthquake.

VALLEY NEEDS MORE POLICE ON THE STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I wholeheartedly agree with Don Schultz who says the residents of the San 
Fernando Valley need to support Councilman Richard Alarcon's motion to create a 
sixth police division in the Valley. ("Crime Bill Funds Should Help 6th LAPD 
Division," Nov. 20).Unfortunately, it is a well-known fact that there have not 
been enough police out there doing their job, and the residents and businesses 
in the San Fernando Valley are suffering as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, I totally disagree with Leon Furgatch's Valley Commentary 
of Nov. 20, which objects to Mayor Richard Riordan's use of Department of Water 
and Power funds to expand the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 As at least a partial result of the DWP's having repeatedly gouged the 
residents of the San Fernando Valley, the DWP is one of the few agencies that 
even has any surplus assets! Clearly, these monies must go toward strengthening 
the Police Department and helping to ensure safer streets in our city so that 
our families and loved ones may survive to enjoy the benefits and services 
provided by the DWP!

DRAMA FESTIVAL SHOWED BRIGHT SIDE OF GRANT HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's time someone mentioned something positive about the young people of 
today. All we ever hear about on the news are gang activities and drive-by 
shootings.To listen to the news at 6 and 11, you'd think that was all today's 
kids are up to. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a lot of press recently about racial tensions at Grant High School. 
It seems some Armenian and Latino kids got into it and there were stabbings and 
a drive-by shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The following Saturday 1,400 young people gathered at Grant for the annual 
fall drama festival, young men and women of all backgrounds and ethnicities. It 
was a love fest. It has been my pleasure to judge many of these competitions 
over the years, and they were all like this. They cheer for their own schools 
but they also cheer for each other. When they see good work, work that is 
obviously better even than their own, they cheer even louder. They are very 
supportive of each other and there were no racial tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 There were also, sadly, no reporters. The winners weren't announced on the 
news at 6 and 11, only more drive-by shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 I have lived and worked in the Valley for more than 25 years. I'm no naive 
schoolboy. I've worked with an awful lot of truly wonderful students, who have 
given me easily much more than I've given them. It's too bad they so rarely get 
the credit they deserve. Maybe if they were noticed in the media the way the 
gangbangers are, another type of role model would be available for the kids 
coming up to emulate.

AHMANSON DEVELOPMENT ACCORD SHORT-SIGHTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was outraged to hear that the Sierra Club recommended an extension for the 
Ahmanson Ranch development agreement in the West Valley.Who voted? I surely did 
not. 
</P>
<P>
 As an active hiker and biker, I have traveled on all of the lands involved in 
this short-sighted agreement, and can say without a doubt the Ahmanson Ranch is 
the most beautiful, pristine, valuable and accessible parcel of land to the 
public for day hikes and excursions. Runkle Ranch, Jordan Ranch and Liberty 
Canyon are not easily accessible and will never be seen by the majority of the 
people.

HISPANICS SHOULD LOBBY SPANISH-LANGUAGE TV 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I found it curious to see a news photograph of Hispanic comedians picketing 
NBC studios over their lack of exposure on prime time TV. One picket sign read, 
"1994 Hispanics -- 10% of Population -- Less Than 1% of Prime Time TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe I use a different math, but considering the market shares, there are six 
national, non-cable networks (NBC, CBS, ABC, FOX, Univision and Telemundo). Two 
are Spanish-language networks. As I calculate it, the sign should have read, 
"1994 Hispanics -- 10% of population -- 33% of prime-time TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Let's not forget that the Spanish-language networks are also guilty of not 
reflecting the population diversity of this country. Forget looking for 90% of 
non-Hispanic actors on Univision or Telemundo. One would be hard-pressed to 
find any fraction of 1% (unless you count a few dubbed commercials). 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the Hispanic actors and comedians should pressure Univision and 
Telemundo to produce more shows domestically, thus using Hispanic talent in 
this country. Instead they save money by buying from Mexico, Venezuela and 
Puerto Rico and sidestep the talent here.

A TEACHER DEFENDS CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS; HERS IS SAFE, QUIET, FULL OF GOOD KIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My dentist has no school-age children. "Tell me, " he said when I was in 
liftoff position in his chair, "why are the schools so bad in California?" 
</P>
<P>
 I'm a middle-school teacher. "They're not! " I retorted, saddened once again 
that yet another person has accepted the prevailing rhetoric as truth. 
</P>
<P>
 My colleagues and I work nine- to 10-hour days. I have six computers in my 
room (I'm unusual but the trend is making this more of the norm) making it 
possible for each student to spend about 40 minutes a week at the keyboard. My 
school is safe, quiet, and full of kids who do things that kids do -- run when 
they should walk, gossip, spend too much time in the bathroom. For that there 
are consequences and they pay them. As in any school there are some repeat 
offenders, but the majority of the kids manage to remain "detentionless." 
</P>
<P>
 My students are reading, writing, working on projects, turning in homework (or 
claiming the dog ate it) as are the other students in the school. I have two 
children in the public school system but in a different school district from 
mine. My eighth-grade son just turned in a short story to his English teacher. 
His algebra teacher is very particular, so he must learn to follow her 
procedures as well as learn algebra. My daughter became Diane Feinstein for a 
project in her humanities class the week before the election. In the spring she 
will travel to New York City with her school's chamber choir to sing in 
Carnegie Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 While I am proud of my children and my students, what they do in school is a 
result of the opportunities the school has made available to them. As a parent 
and a teacher I know improvements can be made, but it is untrue that public 
education is not working.

IRVINE SCHOOLS FAIL THE STANDARDS TEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I often wonder about the state of education in America. The Irvine Unified 
School District is sued because it has higher academic standards for female 
cheerleaders than it has for male football players.A former cheerleader says 
this is discriminatory. She'll get no argument from me. 
</P>
<P>
 So what does the school board do? Does it take the obvious step of raising all 
academic standards, holding their football players to a higher level and 
thereby fulfilling their role as educators ? Do they risk losing the use of the 
talents of athletically gifted but academically questionable players? Do they 
have the guts to do the right thing? 
</P>
<P>
 Nah. I didn't think so.

 A friend recently told me she didn't care if there's a heaven, but she dearly 
hopes there is a hell. 
</P>
<P>
 After reading about children in Orange County going hungry as a matter of 
public policy, I have to agree with her. 
</P>
<P>
 Policy-makers who deprive children of food, health and education in order to 
teach their parents "responsibility" deserve the hottest seats. And the rest of 
us who let them get away with it in our names risk the same.

 * God forbid that Linda Clark, quoted in "Residents Want Costa Mesa to Oust 3 
Charities," (Nov. 22) ever finds herself hungry, poor or homeless. If she does, 
I hope there will be a soup kitchen, a shelter and a clinic to help her.

 * God save us from those conservative "Christians" who now refuse to serve 
breakfast in the schools, saying that it is anti-family and the responsibility 
of the parents. Didn't they ever read the Gospel of Matthew, Chapter 25, where 
we are to feed the hungry?  
</P>
<P>
 Are these the same people who espouse "family values" and voted for 
Proposition 187, which will divide families who have a mixture of documented 
and undocumented persons? Are these the mean-spirited people who blame children 
for the economic woes of California? 
</P>
<P>
 A true Christian is a person who treats "others" as he or she wishes to be 
treated, not one who creates divisions among people.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON MULTICULTURALISM; XENOPHOBIC FEARS ABOUT A 
'NONWHITE MAJORITY' ARE NONSENSE; THE WEALTH OF CULTURAL DIVERSITY THAT 
IMMIGRATION BRINGS SHOULD BE CELEBRATED RATHER THAN DREADED.

<P>
 For some reason Gov. Wilson feels compelled to keep assuring us all (in his 
election night victory speech and more recently at the Heritage Foundation in 
Washington) that Proposition 187 had nothing to do with racism. I guess he 
missed Pat Buchanan's recent rhetoric: "A nonwhite majority is envisioned if 
today's immigration continues." That's a very interesting statement. You might 
stop reading here and reflect a moment about how you feel about the comment. 
Really, stop reading now until you've decided how you feel about " . . . a 
nonwhite majority." 
</P>
<P>
 If your reaction to Buchanan's prediction is, "So what?" then you're a 
fair-minded person. If your reaction is joy, perhaps you're currently a 
so-called "minority" gloating over your anticipated new political power. Or, 
you might be happy in a good way, celebrating the wealth of the cultural 
diversity that Buchanan foretells. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, some of you are reacting in the way Buchanan intended, with 
fear and dread. If these last are the feelings Buchanan's prediction evokes, 
you need to go to the nearest mirror, look yourself in the eye, and say aloud, 
"racist." 
</P>
<P>
 These fears that Buchanan and some others appealed to during the Proposition 
187 debate hark back to the Orange County, California, of 1919. Back then, in 
rural Orange County, the Farm Bureau (the equivalent of the Chamber of Commerce 
in urban America) passed a resolution that in part said, "WHEREAS, the Japanese 
population in California is increasing rapidly and WHEREAS, these people will 
always remain in our midst an alien element unassimilated and unassimilable, 
and WHEREAS, their presence here lays the foundation for a race problem more 
serious than any that ever confronted us and may lead to armed conflict . . . 
RESOLVED, by the directors of the Orange County Farm Bureau, that our senators, 
Hiram W. Johnson and James D. Phelan, and our representative William Kittner . 
. . be asked to use their best and utmost endeavors in favor of the following 
propositions, to wit: . . . rigorous exclusion of Japanese as immigrants . . . 
that Japanese shall forever be barred from American citizenship." 
</P>
<P>
 The Congress back in the 1920s did pass laws that severely restricted Japanese 
immigration. Yet consider how wrong the Farm Bureau directors were. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County of today counts among its prominent citizens many people of 
Japanese ancestry. We even have street names like "Sakioka Drive" and "Yamaha 
Way." A 10-year-old named Casey Okuma recently very well represented Irvine in 
the national Pitch, Hit and Run competition in Arlington, Tex. 
</P>
<P>
 At UC Irvine, consider the most common surname among our students, "Nguyen." 
Indeed, are the sons and daughters of the most recent wave of Asian 
immigration, the Vietnam War refugees, "unassimilable?" Apparently not, judging 
by their marks in the classes I teach. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, I do not find it a problem to be working on a campus with a "nonwhite 
majority" of students. The diversity of cultures among our students enriches 
the campus experience for all of us. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, it's not always easy. We do have conflicts among different groups. 
However, ideas are put up on the table for discussion that might not otherwise 
be in a more homogeneous environment. And that's where the creativity comes in 
American society. Indeed, one of Orange County's most prominent companies, AST 
Research, was founded only 15 years ago by three Asian immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 What is a "nonwhite majority" anyway? Buchanan and the others simply lump 
together those of Asian, African and Latin American heritage into a threatening 
majority. But just ask an Asian American or an African American if he or she 
feels like part of some powerful majority in Los Angeles, where Anglo Americans 
are a minority now. Indeed, it really is kind of stupid to lump together 
Asians, for example. They don't do it. The Japanese culture is quite different 
from the Korean or Chinese or Vietnamese. Certainly these folks of Asian 
heritage have had their own conflicts historically, although not so much here 
in the states. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, how about Hispanics? How different are the views and lifestyles of 
immigrants from Mexico, Cuba, Argentina and Spain? And how do you count someone 
who has emigrated from the Dominican Republic, perhaps a fellow with African 
ancestry that speaks Spanish as his first language. The concept of a nonwhite 
majority is really nonsense, a hateful nonsense created by bigots. 
</P>
<P>
 How should I count myself? My surname is Scottish. My dad hopped a ride on a 
freight car in 1935 to "emigrate" from Nebraska to San Francisco. There he met 
my mother, a fifth-generation Californian. Her ancestor, Pedro Amador, had 
arrived in the Bay Area with the Portola expedition in 1769 and stayed. My 
great aunt on my mother's side can remember her grandfather telling her how 
"those damned Americans" flooded into Alta California, then part of Mexico, and 
wrested away the land from his parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Native Americans have a similar disdain for my Spanish ancestors as 
did my Mexican ancestors for the "invading" Americans of the 1840s. I speak 
little Spanish, but because of my ancestry I can be officially classified as a 
Hispanic. What am I, Mr. Buchanan? That brings us to the "The Bell Curve," the 
highly controversial new book. Is it racism or just realistic statistics, the 
cold, ugly facts of life? The authors say they see a clear relationship between 
IQ and race. The current debate often regards the reliability and validity of 
IQ testing, most agreeing that the tests are useful. Everyone seems to ignore 
the definitions of race and ethnicity. The statistical relationships Murray and 
Hernstein report have meaning only (if then) when we have a clear definition of 
race. And those definitions are blurring. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultraconservatives like Mr. Buchanan often decry affirmative action and argue 
that we should simply ignore race and ethnicity. Treat everyone the same. I 
couldn't agree more if they would just practice what they preach. But instead, 
he and his ilk worry about a "nonwhite majority America." Affirmative action 
exists only in response to such bigotry. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Buchanan argues we need a "timeout" from immigration. I've got a better 
idea. What would America look like in 2050 if we took a timeout, a permanent 
one, from xenophobia and bigotry? 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of lamenting our differences in color, language and culture, we 
instead celebrated our diversity, taking full advantage of the consequent 
creativity and cosmopolitanism within our own borders. Meat and potatoes makes 
for a boring being. Once in a while I prefer some salsa, Szechwan, even some 
sushi.

TV SHOULD CEASE TEACHING TO KILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The classic showdown scenario transpired earlier this week: Two opposing sides 
met up in town, exchanged menacing glares and verbal threats.Guns were drawn, a 
scuffle ensued, shots fired and two lay dead. 
</P>
<P>
 We've seen it a hundred times on TV but this showdown was not in Dodge City, 
it was Woodbridge Center in Irvine! 
</P>
<P>
 It's time to wake up and realize our society is being meticulously taught, by 
our beloved boob tubes, how to kill. Let's demand the public networks stretch 
their collective creativity. Produce programming that lifts its viewers to 
higher levels of thought rather than programs that reduce the caliber of 
entertainment to watching violence. 
</P>
<P>
 We can't blame everything on the gangs.

WHINING ASIDE, THERE ARE POSITIVE SIGNS IN FULLERTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Things are looking up in Fullerton. The utility tax is coming to an end. But 
Fullerton may have a sore winner! At the Nov. 15 City Council meeting, the 
atmosphere was charged with undeserved, hot language aimed by a council member 
at a fellow council member.Can we ask why? Language that is most often spoken 
by overzealous citizens angry at the action about to be taken by the council 
was broadcast, on more than one occasion, by the whining winner from the 
council platform. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote was 4 to 1 for repeal of the utility tax. The attacked council 
member's vote changed nothing, it only added to the majority side. But it was 
marvelous to hear each council member state his or her ideas and vote their 
consciences. So often before the election, there was a voting bloc that 
discouraged many who wanted to add their views. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's hope we see more of the same independence when issues arise at council 
meetings. Ninety-nine and forty-four one-hundredths percent of the people on 
both sides of the utility tax issue want a better Fullerton with more 
businesses and a quality environment. 
</P>
<P>
 It is now time to work together by the civil airing of ideas in the public 
forum where they are judged solely on their merits. Let's hope the civility 
from the council platform as well as the citizens in attendance rules the day.

COUNTY WASTE SOLUTIONS AMOUNT TO SAME OLD RUBBISH; IT'S TIME FOR THE POLITICAL 
LEADERSHIP OF GREATER L.A. TO ONCE AND FOR ALL STOP DUMPING TRASH IN ONE 
ANOTHER'S CANYONS AND BRING AN END TO URBAN LANDFILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By GEORGE PEDERSON, George Pederson is the mayor of Santa Clarita. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In two actions recently, the County Board of Supervisors, on a 4-1 vote, has 
begun the long slide down the slippery slope of fixing 1990s problems with 
1950s solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same meeting, the board: 
</P>
<P>
 * Approved an agreement that would allow the city of Los Angeles to begin 
dumping its trash in the recently expanded area of Sunshine Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 * Authorized the design of a freeway interchange for what would be the world's 
largest dump at Elsmere Canyon, virtually across the street from the Sunshine 
dump. 
</P>
<P>
 The first action relieved Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and the City 
Council of the responsibility to use the city's last remaining landfill. It can 
now export virtually all of the city rubbish to neighboring communities. The 
action also presumably hastened the county's so-called trash crisis by 
absorbing the city's self-imposed landfill capacity shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The second action all but obligates the supervisors to approve the destruction 
of pristine Elsmere Canyon as a dump site because the applicant will have 
already spent so much money on access plans. What's the rush to design an 
interchange for a project when the environmental impact report is years behind 
schedule and still months from public release? Is this massive project a fait 
accompli?  
</P>
<P>
 Isn't it time for a new vision in waste disposal that doesn't call for just 
swapping trash among localities? It was both ironic and sad to watch one 
neighborhood pitted against another. The North Valley Coalition, which has 
vigorously opposed the Sunshine expansion, eagerly supported the Elsmere 
interchange, just because it's around the corner and out of their sight. That 
kind of thinking is what created our waste crises in the first place. As long 
as the advocates for disposal alternatives remain divided, the prevailing 
attitude will be, "Toss it in any other canyon." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita is already ringed by three dumps -- Sunshine and Chiquita 
canyons and the one at the Wayside Honor Rancho. We've decided to draw the line 
at adding Elsmere Canyon as a fourth. We are spending $500,000 a year in the 
fight and have supported Rep. Howard (Buck) McKeon's carrying our case to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita would make money from Elsmere in the form of fees. Why are we 
fighting it? 
</P>
<P>
 First, the destruction of Elsmere Canyon would sever the only wildlife 
corridor linkage between the vast Angeles National Forest and the much smaller 
habitats of the Santa Monica Mountains, Simi Hills and Santa Susana Mountains. 
It would render virtually useless the spending of hundreds of millions of 
public tax dollars to preserve large mammal habitat and open space. In these 
areas, the gene pool for mountain lions, badgers and deer would wither away in 
just one human lifetime. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the potential to pollute the ground water basin and the Santa Clara 
River, which flows to the ocean by way of Piru, Fillmore and Santa Paula, 
should be a concern to all those along its course. It's not a matter of whether 
landfills leak -- only when. The world's largest could leak for a very long 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, Santa Clarita has already had two devastating earthquakes that severed 
our freeway links to the rest of Southern California. You will have a hard time 
convincing us that a one-sixteenth-inch plastic liner with tens of millions of 
tons of trash resting on it will survive a quake when steel-reinforced concrete 
bridges are falling down all around us. If this miracle fiber is so strong, why 
isn't Caltrans building freeways out of it? 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, we need to look only as far as our neighbors in West Covina to be 
concerned about the track record of the BKK Corp. in the operation of its toxic 
waste dump in that community. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's time we recognize that our "back yard" stretches from Lancaster to Long 
Beach, from Malibu to Banning. To continue to stockpile our urban waste within 
this overworked environment is no longer sound public policy. Until we plant 
our feet and say "no more urban landfills," the Board of Supervisors and the 
L.A. City Council will maintain their 1950s attitude that dumping in every 
nearby canyon will somehow solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 We've made great strides in reducing the waste stream through reuse and 
recycling. The immediate landfill capacity crisis seems to have abated. We've 
essentially bought ourselves more time to seek alternatives to urban landfills. 
Even the economics of rail-hauling to remote locations have moved within 
reasonable range, especially when you consider the possible economic 
consequences of having to clean up local drinking-water aquifers. 
</P>
<P>
 It's time for the political leadership of the Greater Los Angeles community to 
join hands and agree once and for all to stop dumping trash in one another's 
canyons and bring an end to urban landfills. Collectively we can solve the 
problem without constructing the world's largest dump in Elsmere Canyon. That's 
not the legacy I want for my grandchildren, and it's not the landmark I want 
decorating the northern gateway to the Los Angeles Basin.

SLAM THE DOOR ON LOW-INCOME HOUSING PLANS; THE CITY'S PROPOSAL TO USE FEDERAL 
QUAKE RECOVERY FUNDS TO CONSTRUCT SUCH HIGH-DENSITY BUILDINGS COULD LEAD TO 
MORE CRIME AND URBAN DECAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SCHULTZ, Don Schultz is president of the Van Nuys Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A recent vote by the Los Angeles City Council was an unwelcome reminder that 
it is way past time for those who represent Van Nuys, North Hollywood, Reseda, 
Pacoima and Canoga Park to reverse course and oppose additional high-density, 
low-income housing in these areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted to link a city earthquake-repair program to more low-income 
housing. The program, proposed by the city Housing Department, will offer 
investors in earthquake-damaged apartments low- or no-interest loans, 
contingent on adding low-income units to the buildings. The interest rate will 
be 3% if the apartment owner reserves 20% of the repaired units for low-income 
housing; zero interest, if 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 This type of housing is usually called affordable housing. A better term would 
be slum housing, when it is built in densely populated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The council members representing Northridge and Sherman Oaks objected -- for a 
time -- to this use of federal aid. "The purpose of this money was to help 
rebuild buildings," Councilman Hal Bernson said. "It was not intended for 
social engineering." Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky questioned the push for 
low-income housing units, saying that they might not be appropriate in every 
reconstruction project. 
</P>
<P>
 Both councilmen were obviously attempting to protect their earthquake-damaged 
communities from a city program that appears to be more concerned with creating 
additional low-income, higher-density housing than repairing earthquake damage. 
Quake repair, remember, was the intended use of the federal funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Potentially, parts of Reseda Boulevard near Cal State Northridge and stretches 
of several streets in Sherman Oaks north of Ventura Boulevard will see 
modest-sized apartment houses replaced with large ones. These buildings will 
bring all the problems associated with crowding of poor people into a cramped 
neighborhood. Similar unfortunate results could occur wherever there is damage 
to apartment houses throughout the Valley, with no study given to the 
desirability of imposing big, low-income units on particular neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 High crime and decaying pride of ownership are among the burdens that 
high-density, low-income housing places on neighborhoods where it is 
concentrated. Police records firmly associate law enforcement problems with 
such housing projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernson and Yaroslavsky, unfortunately, gave in to the lure of low-interest 
loans. By the conclusion of its meeting on Oct. 7, the council had unanimously 
approved the program. I believe this to be an absolute misuse of earthquake 
relief funds. It will encourage more of the type of housing that has led to the 
decayed and crime-infested neighborhoods that now exist throughout the less 
affluent communities in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 If our elected officials really want to develop a successful affordable 
housing program, they must work jointly with developers to create housing that 
does not resemble a stucco prison but instead would instill a sense of 
community. This can be done much more effectively with detached single-family 
dwellings. 
</P>
<P>
 Developers must be given incentives to build smaller two- and three-bedroom 
single-family tract homes as starter homes, instead of the more common three- 
and four-bedroom tract homes. 
</P>
<P>
 We must rebuild in the earthquake-damaged areas of the city now. Creating a 
low-income housing program merely to replace damaged apartments is not 
addressing the affordable housing shortage in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, homeowners and not apartment dwellers have displayed the highest 
degree of pride in their places of residence. This is evident in many of the 
neighborhoods in Van Nuys, North Hollywood, Reseda, Canoga Park and Pacoima. 
</P>
<P>
 With the ever increasing population growth in Southern California and Los 
Angeles County, it is inhumane and insensitive to continue crowding people into 
one large apartment project after another. Such overcrowding might well be 
profitable for the landlord, but it has proven to be devastating to existing 
single-family residential neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 My solution is not complex, and it would help revive the ailing construction 
industry and create jobs, while easing the crowding in existing apartments.

L.A. SCHOOLS STUCK IN THE LOW-TECH RUT OF PAST; HIGH TECHNOLOGY WON'T SOLVE ALL 
OUR EDUCATIONAL PROBLEMS, BUT IT IS A VITAL ELEMENT OF LEARNING FOR OUR 
CHILDREN -- THE FUTURE WORK FORCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. BACKER, James. S. Backer is vice president at Valencia Co., a 
division of the Newhall Land and Farming Co., and chairman of the Education 
Committee of the Santa Clarita Valley Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although America is now moving down the information superhighway, many public 
school students in Southern California seem stuck in the dirt ruts of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Unified School District has only one computer for every 27 
students, one of the lowest ratios in the nation. Statewide, public schools 
have an average of one computer for every 19.8 students, ranking California 
49th among the 50 states. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, many Los Angeles public schools are too run-down to 
permit full use of high technology. The districtwide bill for deferred repairs 
is $600 million. In the San Fernando Valley alone, the backlog is an estimated 
$200 million. How can our students get onto the information superhighway if 
turning on their computers will blow the circuits of their school's electrical 
system? 
</P>
<P>
 High technology won't solve all the problems of our public schools, but it is 
an important tool for learning. Without easy access to it, many students will 
be unable to compete for well-paying jobs in the 21st Century, particularly 
less affluent children who do not have computers at home. Public schools will 
also lose many talented teachers and administrators to districts that offer 
greater access to technology and more fulfilling employment. 
</P>
<P>
 What can be done? 
</P>
<P>
 Educators must do a better job in formulating and selling school tax increases 
and bond issues. In the Santa Clarita Valley, two of the last four bond 
measures have failed to win approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators, for example, could show voters how one school can help improve 
others in the district by creating a library master data base that all can 
access. Voters must be convinced that more money will really make a difference 
in the quality of education, not simply pay for more bureaucracy or underwrite 
inefficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators must appeal to all voters, not just the minority with school-age 
children. School leaders must demonstrate that good schools are essential for 
economic health, not to mention property values. 
</P>
<P>
 And we must change the state Constitution so that bond issues can be approved 
by a simple majority rather than two-thirds. 
</P>
<P>
 But educators must not only look to the voters to fund more high technology in 
our classrooms. They must also forge partnerships with Southern California 
businesses, which recognize that today's children are tomorrow's work force. 
</P>
<P>
 Many businesses are already helping. Through the efforts of the Santa Clarita 
Valley Chamber of Commerce, for example, businesses in the Santa Clarita Valley 
support schools through such programs as Business Buddies, Principal for a Day, 
Adopt-A-School and Teacher Tribute. 
</P>
<P>
 Business Buddies are assigned to an elementary classroom where they work with 
the students individually and in groups over the course of a year. Principal 
for a Day brings business executives to the 38 public schools in the valley to 
experience a day in the life of a school principal. Teacher Tribute is a 
business-sponsored program honoring the Santa Clarita Valley's outstanding 
mentor teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses are also helping local schools obtain equipment. Since 1989, the 
Santa Clarita Valley Chamber of Commerce has raised more than $10,000 for 
public schools. Several months ago, Encino Elementary School received $5,000 
from Citibank to buy software for its computer lab. The bank had "adopted" the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies are donating new computers, printers and software to schools. In 
May, IBM gave 20 computers (worth more than $100,000) to the New Directions for 
Youth Alternative School computer lab in Van Nuys. The lab is for teen-agers 
thinking of dropping out of school and adults in its job training program. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate castoffs are a school's treasure. Many computers which have become 
obsolete for many business applications since the introduction of newer and 
more powerful models still have plenty of capability for use by elementary and 
junior high students. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 To make the most of corporate generosity, Southern California should follow 
the example of the Bay Area's Computer Recycling Center. Schools there need not 
approach businesses on a time-consuming, one-by-one basis. Instead, they can 
apply to the Recycling Center, which receives the computers from corporations, 
repairs and upgrades the equipment as needed, donates the equipment to needy 
schools and provides low-cost service agreements afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 California's industry should form an organization like the Massachusetts 
Software Council, which represents more than 300 companies. Its recently 
published "The Switched-On Classroom" is a planning guide for purchasing and 
using high-tech equipment in schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Our schools, finally, should strengthen their relationships with businesses. 
Schools that receive donated computers should regularly inform the corporation 
how that gift is improving their students' education, perhaps by inviting 
company officials to come and see for themselves. It could recognize the 
corporation through school publications and on bulletin boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Bringing more technology into our public schools will be difficult, but it is 
not impossible. In the past, Southern Californians have overcome many 
challenges, such as constructing a vast water system for our arid region, 
building the world's most complete freeway system and building the finest 
university system in the world. We now face another daunting challenge -- 
educating all our children for the high- tech future. We have the tools, we 
have the resources, so let's get to work.

MIAMI USES TURNOVERS TO DEFEAT BC; BIG EAST: AFTER TRAILING AT HALFTIME, 7-3, 
HURRICANES' DEFENSE GOES TO WORK FOR A 23-7 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Miami Hurricanes' top-ranked defense might next get a crack at the 
nation's No. 1 team. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 5-ranked Miami forced four second-half turnovers Saturday night and 
rallied past Boston College, 23-7, all but clinching a berth in the Orange Bowl 
on Jan. 1 against No. 1 Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we beat them, in our minds we feel we're the best team in the country," 
Miami quarterback Frank Costa said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hurricanes struggled offensively against the No. 25 Eagles and trailed, 
7-3, at halftime. Turnovers led to both touchdowns by Miami, which ranks first 
nationally in total defense and scoring defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston College's Mark Hartsell threw three interceptions in the second half 
and lost a fumble that Corwin Francis recovered at Miami's 33. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, Hurricane Coach Dennis Erickson wore an Orange Bowl hat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The great thing about this win," he said, "is the way we came back in the 
second half after being down and took the game over." 
</P>
<P>
 With the victory, the Hurricanes remained in contention for the national 
championship, finishing the regular season 10-1 overall and 7-0 in the Big East 
Conference. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we play like we're capable of playing, I don't think anybody can play with 
us, including Nebraska," defensive end Kenny Holmes said. "Sometimes that even 
includes teams that play on Sundays." 
</P>
<P>
 Boston College, likely bound for the Aloha Bowl against Kansas State, fell to 
6-4-1 and 3-3-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the game we were looking at," said tight end Pete Mitchell, who 
scored the Eagles' only touchdown. "This was kind of our bowl game. They made 
some great plays defensively. They have so many great athletes." 
</P>
<P>
 Boston College's defense had its moments too. The Eagles sacked Costa six 
times, but he withstood the onslaught to throw touchdown passes of eight yards 
to Trent Jones and 27 yards to Chris T. Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took a lot of shots," Costa told a group of reporters. "You guys can 
criticize me all you want, but you can't say I won't stick my nose in there. 
I'm sure I'll be sore (today), but I feel a lot better since we won." 
</P>
<P>
 On one play, Costa was chased 27 yards behind the line of scrimmage before 
throwing incomplete. Despite the pressure, he completed 22 of 37 passes for 251 
yards with no interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe in his next life he should take up boxing," Eagle Coach Dan Henning 
said. "I never saw anybody come up off the turf like he did. He's a tough guy. 
He took some big-time shots and kept coming back." 
</P>
<P>
 Miami's touchdowns, capping drives of 47 and 67 yards, followed Kenard Lang's 
interception of a tipped pass and the fumble recovery by Francis. Chad Wilson 
and Carlos Jones also had interceptions for the Hurricanes, who allowed only 51 
points in their seven Big East games. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have confidence that sooner or later we're going to score," Costa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami stalled several times deep in Boston College territory, and Dane Prewitt 
kicked field goals of 27, 24 and 32 yards. Prewitt has made 13 attempts in a 
row, breaking Carlos Huerta's school record of 11 in a row set in 1990.

NBA ROUNDUP; RECORDS FALL AS CAVALIERS DOWN WARRIORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark Price scored a season-high 31 points and made five of Cleveland's 
team-record 11 three-pointers as the Cavaliers defeated the Golden State 
Warriors, 101-87, Saturday night in Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cavaliers set an NBA record by attempting only two free throws in the 
game, lowering the mark of three set by the Lakers against San Diego in 1980. 
Cleveland made both tries -- one by John Williams, the other by Tony Campbell 
-- completing a pair of three-point plays in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Price made 13 of his 16 shots from the field, including five of seven from the 
three-point arc, and adding 10 assists. Danny Ferry scored 16 points, including 
12 on four of five shooting from long range. Chris Mills had the other two 
three-pointers for the Cavaliers, who broke the team record of 10 achieved five 
times previously. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors have lost the first three games of the four-game trip that 
concludes today at Detroit. They've been held to less than 100 points in all 
three games. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Gatling led the Warriors with 13 points. Tim Hardaway and Latrell 
Sprewell scored 11 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix 111, San Antonio 108 -- Charles Barkley, activated off the injured 
list only hours before the game, scored 10 of his 23 points in the fourth 
quarter as the Suns outlasted the Spurs in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Barkley fouled out with 6.3 seconds left in his first game this season, and 
Sean Elliott of the Spurs made both free throws, cutting the Phoenix lead to 
109-108. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Suns worked the ball to Danny Manning, who scored his 31st and 32nd 
points of the night to clinch the victory, the sixth without a loss at home for 
the Suns. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Majerle scored 21 points and A.C. Green 17 for the Suns. David Robinson 
had 19 of his 25 points in the second half for the Spurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas 124, Denver 123, OT -- Jim Jackson scored a career-high 50 points, 
including two free throws with 0.5 seconds left in overtime, and the Mavericks 
rallied from a 25-point first-half deficit to beat the Nuggets in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson had 39 of his points in the second half -- 15 of them in the third 
quarter as the Mavericks clawed back to within five points, 16 more in the 
fourth period and, finally, eight in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamal Mashburn scored 35 points for Dallas. Rodney Rogers led Denver with 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston 108, Philadelphia 99 -- Rookie Eric Montross made two free throws with 
1:53 to play and David Wesley made a three-pointer 21 seconds later as the 
Celtics defeated the 76ers in Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Dee Brown scored 22 points, Dino Radja had 19 and Montross finished with 18 
points and 12 rebounds -- both season highs -- for the Celtics, who were 
playing their fourth game in five nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Malone had 28 points and Dana Barros 23 for Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 98, Houston 94 -- Gary Payton's jumper with 11.6 seconds to play broke 
a Rocket comeback and lifted the Supersonics over the defending champions in 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Houston's third consecutive loss after opening the season with nine 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
 Payton's shot came after the Rockets, who trailed most of the second half and 
by as many as nine points, had pulled to 94-92 on a dunk by Robert Horry with 
35 seconds to go. After Payton's jumper, Detlef Schrempf added a pair of free 
throws for the Supersonics with 2.9 seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Vernon Maxwell led the Rockets with 23 and Hakeem Olajuwon had 22. Houston, 
though, had a horrible three-point shooting night, making five of 26. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets didn't lose their third game last season until Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 113, Milwaukee 105 -- Anfernee Hardaway scored 21 of his 35 points in 
the first half and had his first triple double of the season to lead the Magic 
to its seventh consecutive victory, over the Bucks in Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory tied a team record for consecutive victories for the Magic (9-2) 
set Feb. 9-27 last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardaway, who scored a career-high 35 points in Friday's victory over Boston, 
also had 12 assists and 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaquille O'Neal scored 21 points for the Magic, who led from the start. Todd 
Day had 26 points and Glenn Robinson 25 for the Bucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte 105, New York 95 -- Alonzo Mourning scored a game-high 27 points and 
grabbed 18 rebounds as the Hornets sent the Knicks to their first home loss of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks had won their first four games at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Ewing of the Knicks was held to 11 points after the opening quarter, 
in which he scored 11 points to get New York off to a 13-point lead.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; HIGH DRAMA AS NO. 2 NORTH CAROLINA DEFEATS TEXAS, 
96-92 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The playoffs came early to Chapel Hill, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Stackhouse scored a career-high 28 points and made several key plays 
down the stretch Saturday as No. 2 North Carolina escaped with a 96-92 victory 
over Texas in the kind of rapid-paced, tension-filled game usually seen in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first game of the season it was played like an NCAA tournament game," 
said Texas Coach Tom Penders. "The effort by both teams -- kids were flying all 
over the floor and fighting for loose balls and diving on both sides -- it was 
great basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tar Heels, who won their 66th consecutive home opener, trailed at halftime 
and through most of the second half until Stackhouse, a sophomore, rallied his 
team, which could become No. 1 following top-ranked Arkansas' 104-80 loss to 
No. 3 Massachusetts on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could care less about that," Stackhouse said when asked if the Tar Heels 
should be No. 1. "Give it to whoever. . . . I don't take much stock in those 
polls. . . . The No. 1 team last year didn't win the national championship -- 
that was us." 
</P>
<P>
 Texas, with three starters back from the team that went 26-8 last season, led 
for the final time at 87-86 with 4:18 left. Stackhouse, who played the entire 
second half, then blocked a shot and got a return feed from fellow sophomore 
Rasheed Wallace for a dunk that gave the Tar Heels the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina's three sophomores combined for 66 points and all had career 
highs, with Wallace scoring 20 points and getting 13 rebounds and Jeff McInnis 
scoring 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas got 26 points from Terrence Rencher and 25 from Roderick Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing is easy against that team," said Tar Heel Coach Dean Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 4 Kentucky 124, Tennessee Martin 50 -- Jared Prickett scored 21 points to 
lead seven Kentucky players in double figures as the Wildcats overwhelmed the 
error-prone Pacers in Lexington, Ky. 
</P>
<P>
 Kentucky scored 64 points off 42 turnovers by Tennessee-Martin in registering 
one of the most lopsided victories in school history. Kentucky's biggest margin 
of victory was 77 points over Georgia, 143-66, in 1956. 
</P>
<P>
 Kentucky had a 40-24 advantage in rebounds and committed only eight turnovers. 
The Wildcats made 47 of 82 shots (57 percent). 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Delk scored 17 points for Kentucky, followed by Rodrick Rhodes with 16, 
Antoine Walker with 15, Andre Riddick and Mark Pope with 11 each and Walter 
McCarty with 10. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 5 Arizona 73, No. 19 Oklahoma State 63 -- Ray Owes and Damon Stoudamire 
combined for 35 points as the Wildcats defeated the Cowboys to take fourth 
place in the Great Alaska Shootout in Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona (2-1) withstood a second-half three-point barrage by Oklahoma State's 
Randy Rutherford, who was six of eight on three-pointers in the final 20 
minutes and finished with 23 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Owes paced Arizona with 18 points, while Stoudamire had 17, Joseph Blair 13 
and Miles Simon 11. Blair also had 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryant Reeves had 21 points for Oklahoma State (1-2). 
</P>
<P>
 No. 8 Duke 93, Northeastern 70 -- Cherokee Parks scored a career-high 27 
points, and freshman Ricky Price sparked a run late in the first half to lead 
the Blue Devils over the Huskies in Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks and Erik Meek held the advantage on the inside for the Blue Devils, 
playing their second game in as many days. But the Huskies didn't let Duke's 
man-to-man pressure faze them for the opening 15 minutes as they took an early 
lead and tied the score five times in their season opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Duke took control in the second half, stretching its lead to 26, and 
Northeastern got no closer than 17. Meek finished with 14 points on 
six-of-eight shooting, Price had 13 and Blakeney 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrell led Northeastern with 22 points. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 9 Kansas 83, San Diego 65 -- Sean Pearson scored 16 points to lead five 
players in double figures as the Jayhawks routed the Toreros in Lawrence, Kan. 
</P>
<P>
 Kansas (1-0) won its 22nd consecutive opener at Allen Field House and improved 
to 39-1 in home openers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toreros shot only 39% and also struggled holding onto the ball, committing 
22 turnovers that led to 33 Kansas points. 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Harris led San Diego with 21 points. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 12 Cincinnati 108, Austin Peay 73 -- Freshman Danny Fortson scored 25 
points in his college debut and anchored a 61-point first half that carried the 
Bearcats to an easy victory over the the Governors in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 Cincinnati had six players in double figures. Jermaine Savage led Austin Peay 
with 17 points. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 15 Wisconsin 86, Wright State 63 -- Andy Kilbride scored 16 of his 18 
points in the second half in Madison, Wis. as the Badgers won in Stan Van 
Gundy's regular-season debut as coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Kilbride hit all five of his three-point shots in the second half, helping 
Wisconsin offset sluggish games by its stars, Michael Finley and Rashard 
Griffith, who scored 15 and nine points, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 21 Villanova 82, Louisville 81 -- Kerry Kittles' 27 points and a barrage 
of three-pointers powered the Wildcats to the one-point victory over the 
Cardinals in the third-place game of the Great Alaska Shootout in Anchorage. 
</P>
<P>
 After hitting just one of seven from three-point range in the first half, the 
Wildcats buried 10 of 13 in the second half, including seven in the first eight 
minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it took three free throws by Jonathan Haynes with 19 seconds left to 
secure the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 DeJuan Wheat led Louisville with 24 points. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 22 Georgia Tech 112, Florida A&M 56 -- Travis Best scored nine consecutive 
points as the Yellow Jackets jumped to leads of 14-0 and 25-2 and set a school 
record with 24 steals en route to the lopsided victory in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Harping had six of the steals. The Rattlers didn't score more than four 
points in a row until the final two minutes when they scored five unanswered 
points. 
</P>
<P>
 Best led all scorers with 20 points. Ricky Davis had 13 for the Rattlers. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 24 Wake Forest 75, North Carolina Greensboro 55 -- Randolph Childress 
scored 26 points to lead the Demon Deacons over the Spartans in Winston-Salem, 
N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 The season opener was only the second meeting between the schools, which are 
only 25 miles apart. 
</P>
<P>
 UNC-Greensboro led, 47-45, with 12:36 left, but then Wake Forest freshman Tony 
Rutland hit a three-pointer and followed with a steal and layup to make it 
52-45. The Deacons were never again threatened. AROUND THE NATION 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Minor scored 23 points and Oklahoma opened the second half with a 16-2 
run to break away from Coppin State and win, 85-74, in Norman, Okla. in the 
debut of Sooner Coach Kelvin Sampson. . . . Modie Cox hit a short floater in 
the lane with 31 seconds to play as Buffalo posted what might be its biggest 
win since turning Division I in 1991-92 with a 71-68 decision over Rutgers in 
Piscataway, N.J. . . . Creighton snapped a school-record 30-game road losing 
streak by opening the season with a 68-61 victory over Oral Roberts.

LOYOLA MARYMOUNT ROLLS IN OPENER; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: JONES SCORES 24 POINTS IN 
92-51 ROUT OF DIVISION II CAL STATE HAYWARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK STRODER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Victories haven't come easily for Loyola Marymount basketball Coach John Olive 
during his first two seasons -- especially lopsided victories. 
</P>
<P>
 So Cal State Hayward, which competes on the NCAA Division II level, was put on 
the schedule to open the 1994-95 season. 
</P>
<P>
 And Loyola Marymount rolled to a 92-51 victory Saturday night before 942 at 
Gersten Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyking Jones led the way with 24 points and four other Lions scored in double 
figures as Loyola Marymount recorded its most lopsided victory since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's face it: It's nice to have an easy win, no matter who it's against," 
said Olive, whose teams won only 13 of 41 games in his first two seasons. "Our 
enthusiasm and intensity were really nice to see tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jones, who made 10 of 15 shots: "Last year, we didn't get any easy wins. 
We opened up with UCLA last year and that didn't go well at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola Marymount opened last season with a 115-77 loss to the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Hayward, the Lions started quickly, making 58% of their shots in the 
first half while holding the Pioneers (0-2) to 29% shooting and building a 
50-22 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones scored 16 points in the first half and point guard Jim Williamson had 11 
points and five assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played really good defense in the first half and we rebounded well," said 
Williamson, a sophomore who matched a career high with nine assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "We moved the ball around well and we were taking good shots and not forcing 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola Marymount cruised in the second half, as most of the starters headed 
for the bench with about 10 minutes to play. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lions wound up making 51.5% of their shots and held Hayward to 32.8% 
shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Olive is hoping his team can put together many quality performances this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to establish our identity as a team," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel we've put a good team together over the past two to three years and 
now we've got to show it." 
</P>
<P>
 Ime Oduok scored 13 points for the Lions. Cobi McElroy had 12 points and 10 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayward was led by Lamont Kelly, who scored 21 points.

YOUTH SERVES PEPPERDINE IN OPENER; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: FRESHMEN MERRILL AND 
MARCACCINI LEAD THE WAY IN 72-66 VICTORY OVER CAL STATE DOMINGUEZ HILLS. 
</P>

<P>
 If a college basketball team is only as good as its seniors, as new Pepperdine 
Coach Tony Fuller suggested recently, this could be a long season for the 
Waves. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Pepperdine lacks experienced leadership was plainly evident 
Saturday as the Waves rallied behind two freshmen to defeat Cal State Dominguez 
Hills, 72-66, at Firestone Fieldhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 In their college debuts, reserve forward Josh Merrill led Pepperdine with 18 
points on seven-of-10 shooting, and starting forward Monte Marcaccini had 15 
points and a team-high eight rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Josh Merrill came and saved us today, that's for sure," Fuller said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fuller stressed that he doesn't want his team to get in the habit of 
relying on its freshmen, even though the Waves have no proven go-to players. 
</P>
<P>
 "That wouldn't be fair to them," Fuller said. "I don't want to put them in 
that type of a pressure situation. I would hope that our seniors and 
upperclassmen would lead us." 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine did get a late lift from senior forward Clark James, who scored all 
of his nine points in the second half, but aside from that the Waves relied on 
underclassmen in a game that was too close for too long to suit Fuller. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to work on a lot of things," he said. "We didn't handle the ball 
well. We didn't play individual defense well. We have some guys who didn't play 
today like they're capable of playing." 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine got only four points and four rebounds in 19 minutes from 
seven-foot junior Gavin Vanderputten, who was a head taller than anyone in the 
game, and point guard Joey Ramirez missed all five of his shots, finishing with 
two points in 32 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez Hills, which competes on the Division II level, traded leads with 
Pepperdine in the first half until Merrill made a three-point shot at the 
buzzer to put the Waves ahead, 36-34. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-point basket by Michael Whittiker to open the second half put 
Dominguez Hills (0-2) back on top, but Pepperdine answered with a 9-0 run that 
included two baskets by James to take a 45-37 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominguez Hills, after falling behind by as many as 11 points, cut its deficit 
to 65-61 on a three-point shot by guard Chris Thompson with 1:44 to play before 
Pepperdine closed out by making seven of eight free throws, including three of 
four by Marcaccini. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittiker led Dominguez Hills with a game-high 21 points, but the junior guard 
made only seven of 23 shots.

 Tina Thompson scored a career-high 35 points to help 23rd-ranked USC to an 
87-76 victory over Marquette on Saturday in the opening round of the Hawkeye 
Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson, expected to be the focal point of the USC offense now that player of 
the year Lisa Leslie is gone, filled that role admirably in the Trojans' 
opener. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-3 sophomore, the Pacific 10 Conference freshman of the year last 
season, made 14 of 27 shots in topping her previous best of 24 points against 
Arizona State last February. She also had 12 rebounds as USC outrebounded 
Marquette, 62-42. 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Karleen Shields scored 24 points for USC, 17 in the first half. 
Christine Kennedy led Marquette (0-2) with 22 points.

 Making the final start of his career in the NYRA Mile on Saturday at Aqueduct, 
Bertrando virtually ran right off the plane.He didn't arrive in New York until 
Saturday morning and competed several hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-year-old Skywalker horse would have been better off if his flight had 
been delayed. 
</P>

 Bertrando bowed out of the game with a whimper, finishing 10th of 12 in the 
$250,000 race, which was easily won by 8-1 shot Cigar.

STATE CROSS-COUNTRY CHAMPIONSHIPS; GARRITSON WINS BATTLE OF FRESHMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT FARMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The shoes fit, and Buena Park freshman Heather Garritson wore them all the way 
to a State cross-country title. 
</P>
<P>
 Garritson posted the second-fastest time of the day, 18 minutes 1 second, over 
the five-kilometer (3.1-mile) course at Woodland Park, to win the title 
outright and avenge a loss to fellow freshman Elaine Canchola of Ojai Nordhoff 
in last weekend's Southern Section finals. 
</P>
<P>
 Garritson, who last week inadvertently raced in her younger brother's shoes, 
which were 1 1/2 sizes too small, ran away from Canchola in the correct shoes, 
edging her by six seconds at the finish line. Corona del Mar senior Tracy 
Clark, the county champion this fall, placed third in 18:18. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wore the wrong shoes last week," said Garritson. "They were the same exact 
(brand) shoes, just my younger brother's." 
</P>
<P>
 The title was the third for the Garritson family; Heather's older sister, 
Carrie, won one for Buena Park (1993) and one for Sunny Hills (1991). 
</P>
<P>
 The day's fastest time for the girls was run by Santa Rosa sophomore Julia 
Stamps, who narrowly missed becoming the first prep athlete to break 17 minutes 
with her 17:06 performance, a course record. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza senior Courtney Pugmire (18:08), the Sunset League and section 
Division I champion, outdistanced Irvine junior Jessica Corbin (18:18) for 
second place behind Stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Stamps) just kind of left . . . I wasn't really worried about her," Pugmire 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 County champion Adalberto Sanchez of Capistrano Valley posted the fastest time 
by an area athlete, running 15:35 for fifth in the Division I race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I went out too fast," said Sanchez, who won the section Division I 
race last weekend while leading the entire way. 
</P>
<P>
 The surprise of the day came in the Division III boys' race, in which El 
Modena secured a second-place finish by scoring 101 points. Nordhoff, the 
Southern Section champion, won with 69. Livermore placed third with 117. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had our top five guys within 17 seconds of each other and that was the 
key," Vanguard Coach Tom Weber said. "They are the classic overachievers." 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra (168) finished sixth in the same race; Corona del Mar (184) was 
seventh. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mater Dei boys, the defending county champions, finished fourth (161) in 
Division II, behind Carmichael Jesuit (72), Mira Mesa Scripps Ranch (106) and 
Palmdale (152). 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine and El Toro girls, the two top-ranked teams in the county, finished 
third and eighth in the Division I race. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaqueros, the Sea View League and county champions this fall, earned 127 
points. The Chargers, runners-up in the league and county races, scored 197. 
</P>
<P>
 In the day's closest team battle, Clovis Buchanan (108) and Yucaipa (108) 
edged Sunset League champion Edison (111) for the Division II crown. 
</P>
<P>
 Buchanan was awarded the team title based on the faster sixth runner, taking 
the title from the third-place Chargers, the defending champions. 
</P>
<P>
 The El Modena girls placed third in the Division II race (91 points), behind 
Clayton Valley (65) and Lake Elsinore Temescal Canyon (78). 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Brethren Christian senior Brandon Pacheco placed 12th in the Division IV race 
(16:26) . . . Santa Margarita sophomore Katie Nuanes, who led the Eagles to the 
State Division III title a year ago, placed seventh in 18:36 . . . Katella 
senior Jamie Vaicaro (19:19) placed 12th in the Division II girls' race, 
followed closely by Edison senior Elyse Homberger (19:21) who was 13th . . . 
Eliaser Estrada (18:43) of Santa Ana Valley and Nancy Dollar (18:57) of San 
Clemente placed seventh and 10th in the Division I race . . . Michael Murray 
posted the fastest time by a 10th-grader in the county, finishing in 16:00 for 
10th place in Division III . . . Sunny Hills senior Garrett Jensen, the Freeway 
League champion, turned in the county's second-fastest effort, running 15:53 
for eighth in the Division II competition.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOLLEYBALL REGIONAL PLAYOFFS; DIVISION I; NEWPORT HARBOR 
ISN'T HOSPITABLE IN SWEEPING TO VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Newport Harbor girls' volleyball Coach Dan Glenn knows what it's like to be on 
the road for the holidays, because that's where the Sailors were a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he's getting accustomed to playing host. 
</P>
<P>
 The top-seeded Sailors weren't very hospitable to Rancho Bernardo as they 
swept the Broncos, 15-1, 15-1, 15-5, in a Southern California Regional 
quarterfinal match Saturday night at Newport Harbor High. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors (31-1) next play host to Santa Cruz Harbor, which defeated Santa 
Rosa 15-8, 15-11, 15-2, in the semifinals on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am just happy to be playing at home after being on the road last year," 
Glenn said. "And it's great to be this far in the State (playoffs)." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season at this time, Newport Harbor was leaving for Stockton to play its 
semifinal match against St. Mary's after defeating Poway on the road. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors won that match in four games before losing to top-seeded Corona 
del Mar in the championship. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough traveling on the road over Thanksgiving weekend," Glenn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-seeded Rancho Bernardo (27-12) came from fourth place in its league to 
win the San Diego Section Division I title, but the Broncos were in trouble 
from the start against Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Tina Bowman and Misty May had kills to give the Sailors a quick 2-0 lead. 
Bowman then added another spike and blocked a Bronco kill for a 5-0 advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors increased their lead to 13-0 before Rancho Bernardo got a point 
when May slammed her spike off the net. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor came back with a kill from Josie Hecker and May then finished 
Game 1 with her sixth kill of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors continued to roll in the second game, jumping to an 11-0 lead on 
seven Bronco ball-handling and hitting errors. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Bernardo then got its second point of the match on a lift call, but two 
hitting errors and two more Newport Harbor kills closed out Game 2. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the Sailor starters were on the floor to open Game 3, but were 
substituted for one by one as the team pulled out to another big lead.

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA VOLLEYBALL REGIONAL PLAYOFFS; DIVISION II; HUNTINGTON BEACH 
SETTLES MATTERS ON COURT WITH VICTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ITAGAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a State tournament that began with some questionable seedings for Edison 
and Huntington Beach, the Sunset League rivals settled their differences on the 
court Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this season, the teams split two five-game league matches. But 
Huntington Beach won the rubber match, closing out Edison, 10-15, 15-13, 15-9, 
15-4, in a second-round Southern California Regional Division II match at 
Huntington Beach High. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior outside hitter Melissa Wendt had 23 kills and setter Mindy Adam had 54 
assists for top-seeded Huntington Beach (18-3), which will play Bakersfield 
Stockdale, a 15-12, 6-15, 9-15, 15-12, 15-12 winner over Del Mar Torrey Pines, 
in the Division II regional final Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Oilers will travel for the regional final because they have the No. 3 
travel priority number. Second-seeded Stockdale has the No. 1 travel priority 
numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't make a lot of sense," Huntington Beach Coach Rocky Ciarelli said. 
"I don't know why they didn't just seed us third. Maybe they wanted us to play 
Edison in the second round." 
</P>
<P>
 Edison Coach Dave Mohs questioned the seeding for the Division II bracket last 
week. The Chargers (20-4) won the Sunset League and Huntington Beach finished 
second. Edison also was ranked higher in the final state coaches' poll. 
</P>
<P>
 But home-court advantage probably wouldn't have helped Edison enough Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendt, a 6-foot-2 junior who was a second-team all-county selection by The 
Times last season, played a strong match but she had plenty of help. 
</P>
<P>
 Jill Meyers, a 5-10 junior middle blocker, had 15 kills and Kim Watts, a 5-7 
senior, added 14. Senior middle blocker Stacy Vanderwal had seven kills, 
including three early in the fifth game to help the Oilers take a 6-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 And Adam used all of those weapons to keep the Chargers guessing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mindy did some good things early and got everyone involved," Huntington Beach 
Coach Rocky Ciarelli said. "Jill had her share, Kim had her share, Stacy played 
a great match. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's as balanced as we've been all year. And when we don't have to depend 
on one person so much, it makes it that much easier." 
</P>
<P>
 Things started easily enough for Huntington Beach as it took a 6-1 lead in 
Game 1. But Edison's defense helped force some hitting errors by Wendt, and the 
Chargers won 13 of the last 16 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach raced to a 10-1 lead in Game 2, but Edison battled back, and 
a spike by Edison's Jennifer Porterfield made it 14-12. But a kill by Wendt 
gave the Oilers a side out, then a block by Vanderwal gave the Oilers the game. 
</P>
<P>
 It all began to unravel for Edison in Game 3, when Erin McCown, who had 12 
kills, fired a spike wide. A kill by McCown would have pulled Edison to within 
12-8, and Mohs' disagreement with the call cost him a yellow card and the 
Chargers lost Game 3, 15-9.

 Stanford Coach Dante Dettamanti knew it was going to be a defensive struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately for him, it was the Cardinal defense that prevailed in a 9-5 
victory over UCLA in the semifinals of the NCAA water polo tournament Saturday 
night at Belmont Plaza Pool in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The defending champion Cardinal (26-1) will face USC (19-6) in today's final 
at 4:30 p.m. Stanford defeated the Trojans, 11-9, in last year's final. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-seeded Trojans rallied from a 3-1 deficit to defeat Cal, 11-6. 
Senior Drew Netherton scored two goals for the Trojans, who are looking for 
their first national title in the sport after finishing second three times and 
third four times. 
</P>
<P>
 Goaltender Jack Bowen made 10 saves, several from close range, to lead 
top-seeded Stanford. 
</P>
<P>
 He had six saves in the second quarter, helping Stanford to a 7-2 halftime 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel our defense won the game for us," Dettamanti said. "We were averaging 
12 to 13 goals a game, so we knew we had to play good defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "The second quarter was the turning point. Jack made some great saves and we 
were able to outscore them, 4-1." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Bruins' fifth loss to Stanford this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We needed to snap back into it offensively after the first quarter," UCLA 
Coach Guy Baker said. "Bowen had some great saves." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Laster had five steals during the second quarter to contain the Bruins' 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford led after three quarters, 9-3. Wolf Wigo, Dan Hancock and Josh 
Leachman each had two goals for the Cardinal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my job to play off what the defense is giving me," Bowen said. "Allowing 
five goals is a credit to our defense. Ever since the Mountain Pacific 
(tournament) two weeks ago, it has been clicking. I guess it's a good time to 
click." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Covic scored two goals and goalie Matt Swanson made 10 saves for UCLA 
(18-7).

STATE HIGH SCHOOL CROSS-COUNTRY CHAMPIONSHIPS; THOUSAND OAKS BOYS, PENINSULA 
GIRLS WIN 
</P>

<P>
 The Thousand Oaks High boys' cross-country team won its second consecutive 
Division I title in the CIF State championships Saturday at Woodward Park, but 
Peninsula upset the Lancers in the girls' race. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers' 82-91 victory prevented Thousand Oaks from becoming the first 
school to win both state Division I titles in the same year. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks, paced by the 3-6-9 finish of seniors Jeff Fischer, Keith 
O'Doherty and Kevin Marsden, posted a 38-106 victory over runner-up Chula Vista 
in the boys' race. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Lancers' 68-point victory was three points greater than last 
year, the cumulative time of their top five runners (79 minutes 9 seconds) was 
well off their course record (77:59) from 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Improved performances from its Nos. 2-5 runners keyed Peninsula in the girls' 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks had placed three runners ahead of the Panthers' No. 2 runner in 
winning the Southern Section championships last week, but Peninsula had four 
girls in front of the Lancers' fourth, and five in front of their fifth, on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Julia Stamps of Santa Rosa continued her superb sophomore season by winning 
the Division I girls' title in 17:06. The time broke the 5,000-meter course 
record of 17:13 set by Milena Glusac of Fallbrook in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Balkman of San Jose Lynbrook won the Division I boys' title with a time 
of 15:15, finishing five seconds in front of Eleazer Hernandez of Camarillo.

COLLEGE ROUNDUP; CHAPMAN RALLIES PAST SONOMA STATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Chapman rallied from a nine-point, second-half deficit and defeated Sonoma 
State, 90-84, in a nonconference men's basketball game Saturday at the Hutton 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory, in the Panthers' home opener, was a nice rebound for a team that 
was easily handled by Claremont-Mudd in its season opener Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman Coach Mike Bokosky said he hadn't prepared his team properly for its 
first game, but he apparently solved the problem Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think coaches sometimes aren't in coaching shape early in the year -- not 
physically, but mentally," Bokosky said. "Every game is important. But this is 
important because we need to make sure our guys start to believe in what we 
want them to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Something seems to be sinking in. Saturday, the Panthers (1-1) had every 
chance to let Sonoma State (0-3) pull away in the second half, but didn't fold. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonoma State led, 40-39, at the half, but Chapman hung tough early in the 
second half, taking a 50-49 lead on a jump shot by Stefan Mumaw with 16 minutes 
13 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 But then Sonoma State started a 16-6 run that gave the Cossacks a nine-point 
lead with 12:58 left. Sonoma was threatening to build its lead when Chapman 
made its second consecutive turnover, but Michael DeSantis missed a three-point 
shot on the fast break. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cossacks scored only one point during the next six minutes. Chapman's 18-1 
run gave the Panthers a 74-66 lead with 6:51 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman guards Adam Dzierzynski and Toby Curto finished the spree with 
consecutive three-pointers. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonoma State cut the lead to three points with two minutes left, and was close 
to forcing Chapman's 35-second clock to expire when Panther freshman Ramin 
Bastani rebounded a miss by Mumaw and scored as the shot clock expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Bastani, from Corona del Mar, was fouled and made the free throw to give 
Chapman an 86-80 lead with 42 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Caltech men's basketball tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Pacific Christian 95, Caltech 76 -- Charles Ross scored 26 points to lead 
Pacific Christian (6-2) in the championship game. Ross was later named the 
tournament's most valuable player. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Shields added 15 points for Pacific Christian. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Humboldt State women's basketball tournament: 
</P>
<P>
 Concordia 80, Concordia (Ore.) 72 -- Michelle Kravik had 14 points to lead 
Concordia (1-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Goodfellow was the game's high scorer with 22 for Concordia (Ore.), 
which is 1-4. 
</P>
<P>
 In women's volleyball: 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach 3, Houston 0 -- Traci Dahl had 27 kills and Heather Hofmans had 55 
assists as Long Beach State (25-5) swept Houston, 15-7, 16-14, 15-12, at the 
Long Beach Baden Blowout. Nichelle Burton also had 16 kills for the 49ers.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE REGIONAL SOCCER PLAYOFFS; ISLAS' GOAL IN OVERTIME LIFTS 
RANCHO SANTIAGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Rancho Santiago's Francisco Islas was kept silent during most of Saturday's 
Southern California men's soccer playoff game against Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 But Islas didn't let up. 
</P>
<P>
 His persistence paid off with the game-winning goal in the 117th minute, 
giving the Dons a 1-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Islas, who scored nearly half of Rancho Santiago's goals this season, was 
limited to three shots during regulation, and was not a factor during most of 
the overtime period. 
</P>
<P>
 But with three minutes left in overtime, he took a rebound from Andrew Otelie 
on the right side of the net, and banked in the game-winner off the left goal 
post. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal spoiled an outstanding performance by Glendale goalkeeper Erick 
Alvarado, who made 17 saves. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale had only six shots and Rancho Santiago goalkeeper Scott Zinser didn't 
record a save. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we were hungrier than they were," Rancho Santiago Coach J.P. Frutos 
said. "We were all over them, and we finally executed. I think luck played a 
part in that goal." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons (17-2-3) dominated the first half, outshooting Glendale, 11-3. Rancho 
Santiago's best scoring opportunity came when Arthur Salce's header hit the 
crossbar at the 25-minute mark. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaqueros (15-1-5) recovered after halftime, but still found themselves on 
defense most of the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale's best scoring opportunity came midway through overtime but Giancarlo 
Madariaga's shot on a breakaway went wide left. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Rancho Santiago) deserved to win," Glendale Coach Joe Agoston said. "Our 
game never really developed. We were sloppy in the first half, and settled down 
in the second. I don't think we were mentally ready to win at this level." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons advance to the State tournament, which will be played Dec. 3-4 in 
Sacramento.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE REGIONAL SOCCER PLAYOFFS; MOORPARK'S FISHER MAKES SAVE, SINKS 
CYPRESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE KRESAL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Goalkeeper Amy Fisher made several key saves Saturday but none bigger than the 
final one during penalty kicks that sent Moorpark to the State women's soccer 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark, the fourth-seeded team in Southern California, and top-seeded 
Cypress were tied, 1-1, after 90 minutes of regulation and 30 minutes of 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was decided by penalty kicks and Moorpark won, 3-2, when Fisher dived 
far to the right to knock away a shot by Cypress' Christy Rowe. Fisher had 13 
saves in regulation and four in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Ranuschio, Summer Salvatera, and Maureen O'Hare scored on penalty 
kicks for Moorpark (10-3-4). The state tournament is Dec. 3-4 in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Tyler and Tracy Van Herk scored for Cypress, which has won three 
consecutive Orange Empire Conference titles. The Chargers end the season 
16-1-2. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second consecutive postseason loss on penalty kicks for Cypress, 
which lost in the same manner to DeAnza in the state title game last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all had our Lucky Charms for breakfast today," Moorpark Coach Ken Dale 
said. "It's a tough way for either team to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress dominated the first half, but Fisher had seven saves and the teams 
were tied, 0-0. Cypress' offense struggled partly because starting forwards 
Traci Osman (ankle) and Lori Van Herk (knee) were out because of injuries. 
Osman had nine goals this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark's offense improved in the second half but Cypress broke the scoreless 
tie when Pam Prine scored her 10th goal off an assist by Rowe in the 81st 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark rallied about two minutes later when Christy McGowan put a rebound 
past Cypress goalkeeper April O'Brien.

USC GETS EVEN, BUT THAT'S ALL; BLOCKED FIELD GOAL SETS UP TYING SCORE; COLLEGE 
FOOTBALL: TROJANS SETTLE FOR 17-17 TIE, ENDING LOSING STREAK AT 11 GAMES 
AGAINST NOTRE DAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Notre Dame's 11-game winning streak over USC became a 12-game unbeaten streak 
Saturday on a bitterly cold and windy night at the Coliseum.  
</P>
<P>
 In a 17-17 tie before 90,217, USC seemed to have the late-game momentum, after 
linebacker Israel Ifeanyi and safety Sammy Knight combined for the most 
explosive play of the night, one that set up the Trojans' tying score.  
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-6 Ifeanyi made a leaping, one-handed block of a 37-yard field-goal 
try by Notre Dame's Stefan Schroffner with 6:43 left in the game.  
</P>
<P>
 Knight picked it up and ran 56 yards to the Notre Dame 16. 
</P>
<P>
 USC trailed at the time, 17-10, and Trojan partisans were roaring. 
</P>
<P>
 Tailback Shawn Walters, playing with a painful cracked right thumb, got it to 
the Notre Dame one on two punishing runs, then carried twice more, scoring from 
the one-foot line to make it 17-16 with 4:53 to go.  
</P>
<P>
 Cole Ford tied it with a kick, and the first question for USC Coach John 
Robinson afterward was about the spurned two-point conversion play.  
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't come here to play for a tie, but I was afraid if we missed a two, 
we wouldn't get the ball back," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 But they did, when sophomore quarterback Ron Powlus, who had taken the Irish 
on 80- and 65-yard touchdown marches, couldn't move the ball this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame's drive was stopped by tackles for losses by cornerback Brian Kelly 
and nose tackle Cedric Jefferson (a loss of eight yards), and an open-field 
tackle of a scrambling Powlus by linebacker Donn Cunnigan.  
</P>
<P>
 And when Notre Dame's Chris Wachtel got off a 29-yard punt to USC's 48, the 
Trojans (7-3-1) had a decent chance to pull it out with 2:22 to go, but 
quarterback Rob Johnson's offensive line failed him.  
</P>
<P>
 After two losses -- one on a sack, the other when Johnson tripped over a 
teammate -- John Stonehouse punted 51 yards to Notre Dame's eight. The Irish, 
with less than a minute to play, never made a serious threat. 
</P>
<P>
 The tie left unclear what bowl lies ahead for USC or Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson saluted Stonehouse, who had a 65-yard punt in a cross-wind in the 
third quarter and averaged 48.8 yards on five punts, many pinning the Irish 
deep.  
</P>
<P>
 "John Stonehouse is a truly great punter and he's had a fabulous season," 
Robinson said.  
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, battling an at-times surging Irish rush as well as swirling winds, 
was 15 for 29 for 187 yards, with a touchdown and an interception. Powlus was 
13 for 22 for 115 yards, with a touchdown and no interceptions.  
</P>
<P>
 Of Ifeanyi's field-goal block, Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz said he should have 
listened to his players. It was fourth and two at USC's 20. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our kicker did not get the ball up at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so low, I hoped it would clear the center. Our players wanted me to go 
for it, and I probably should have. I asked the kicker: 'Can you make this?' 
and he said: 'Yeah . . . I think so.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In a game played in a hard, cold wind -- 48 degrees and 20- to 25-m.p.h. winds 
at kickoff -- the wind wasn't a factor on the game's deciding kick play. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was a factor on passing downs, Robinson said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was hard to throw, for both sides," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Some guys' hats were blown off on our sideline. A lot of passes were 
dovetailing." 
</P>
<P>
 USC's Keyshawn Johnson caught six passes for 114 yards. It was his eighth 
100-yard game, and seventh in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson was winless a second consecutive year against the Irish because his 
defense couldn't stop Notre Dame's running game. Lee Becton (156 yards) led a 
charge that netted 226 yards, compared to USC's 87.  
</P>
<P>
 A year ago at South Bend, Becton ran for 177 -- still his career high -- and 
the Irish had 305 rushing yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to Becton and his offensive line, Notre Dame (6-4-1) nearly doubled the 
possession time of USC, more than 38 minutes to the Trojans' 21:30. 
</P>
<P>
 On the drive capped by Powlus' one-yard plunge for Notre Dame's 17-10 
third-quarter lead, Powlus got the Irish to the USC three with a 17-yard throw 
over the middle to Derrick Mayes.  
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame took a 10-7 halftime lead on Powlus' 19th touchdown of the season, 
a new one-season Irish record.  
</P>
<P>
 And it concluded the first half's best drive, an 80-yarder -- after Johnson 
had taken USC 34 yards for a 7-3 lead.  
</P>
<P>
 Ford's kickoff, riding a howling wind, went out of the end zone, but Becton 
produced good field position for the Irish on the first play. He burst through 
the Trojans' left side for 28 yards, and then Powlus hit Mayes for an 
18-yarder.  
</P>
<P>
 Two plays later, Becton went up the middle for six, putting Notre Dame at the 
USC 22.  
</P>
<P>
 The touchdown was an impressive bit of playmaking by the first-year 
quarterback. Dancing about in the face of a Trojan rush, he looked at multiple 
receivers, then finally hit Ray Zellars in the end zone with 1:01 left before 
halftime.  
</P>
<P>
 Johnson took USC to the Irish 20 in the final minute, but Ford missed a 
38-yard field-goal attempt.  
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame started the game with a drive that resembled the first half against 
USC a year ago, when the Irish won, 31-13. Powlus, starting at his 21, took his 
team 68 yards in 12 plays.  
</P>
<P>
 Powlus got Notre Dame to the USC nine, but linebackers Jeff Kopp and Brian 
Williams ran a scrambling Powlus out of bounds on third and goal, and 
Schroffner kicked a 29-yard field goal for a 3-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans got the lead after a poor Irish series, following Stonehouse's 
punt to Notre Dame's two.  
</P>
<P>
 Two of Powlus' receivers, Charles Stafford and Oscar McBride, dropped balls 
that Powlus put right in their hands. A short punt gave USC the ball at the 
Notre Dame 34. 
</P>
<P>
 On third and three, Rob Johnson hit Keyshawn Johnson, who slipped away from 
two tacklers and reached the Irish four. Leonard Green gained two, lost three, 
and then Rob Johnson hit Johnny McWilliams on the goal line for a score, the 
55th touchdown pass of his career. Rose Bowl Race

COMMENTARY; ALCORN STATE'S STEVE MCNAIR RATED COLLEGE FOOTBALL'S BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 An hour before the game, Steve McNair cried. "It hit me," he said. It could 
have been his last college football game. "I love these guys," he said. And so, 
an hour before kickoff, he stood before his Alcorn State University teammates 
in the locker room and said his piece. We let Grambling slip away, he said. We 
can't let JSU slip away, too. There weren't many dry eyes, his coach said, when 
Steve McNair finished talking. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the first seven minutes, McNair and his buddies scored three 
touchdowns. In the resulting 52-34 victory over Jackson State, McNair completed 
29 of 54 passes for 533 yards and five touchdowns. On this day, little white 
boys wearing Ole Miss caps also wore Air McNair T-shirts, integration of a 
kind. Everywhere Steve McNair went, a Mississippi state trooper walked at his 
side, sometimes carrying the hero's helmet for him. And why not? Steve McNair 
is a good one. He's Charlie Ward times two. He's so good that his every move on 
a football field is analyzed by men who put a dollar sign on the muscle. So 
good that if you see him from the sideline you believe there's no better 
quarterback in any college anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 That last sentence is not meant to patronize the poor, li'l ol' forgotten 
schools of the South that get notice only when someone remembers: Walter 
Payton! Jerry Rice! Doug Williams! Eddie Robinson and Grambling! No patronizing 
here, no giving Steve McNair anything he hasn't earned. This man can play. A 
Mississippi sportswriter said, "He is the Truth." 
</P>
<P>
 There's only a small chance McNair can win the Heisman Trophy because too many 
voters disparage his surroundings and competition. He plays in Division I-AA, a 
far distance below the I-A'ers who strut in elite-media adoration. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, while the talent in McNair's league is only occasional, that talent can 
be startling. Payton and Rice are proof great athletes are born with gifts 
undiminished by place. Sometimes they are even driven by a need to certify 
their worth before a yowling chorus of doubters. 
</P>
<P>
 To turn this argument into a question, who would you rather have at 
quarterback, a pampered prodigy or a hardscrabble gunslinger? Quarterbacks have 
won the Heisman who have had nothing in common with Hose Manning, the Oklahoma 
studhorse who threw the hoghide deep for the New York Giants the year Billy 
Clyde Puckett carried them to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who laughed his way through Dan Jenkins' classic novel, "Semi-Tough," 
remembers Hose Manning, a quarterback with stringy hair and acne scars and one 
kidney after the car wreck. Hose threw with a quick release, and his ball was 
easy to catch because it flew with the nose up. "Best milker on the farm," is 
what Jenkins wrote about Hose. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve McNair's football work has been done in hardscrabble magnifying-glass 
towns, places you can't find without putting a map under Grandma's sewing 
glass. The day he showed up for ninth-grade football in Mount Olive, Miss., the 
coach, Maxwell McGee, took one look and said, "There's one." Eight years later, 
the coach explains what he meant: "You could see it coming." 
</P>
<P>
 You could see Steve McNair, born to his art. For Coach McGee and Mount Olive 
High School, McNair played shortstop, point guard and quarterback. The coach 
first noticed McNair's vision in basketball. He could see everyone on the 
court. "Like he had eyes all around his head," the coach says. 
</P>
<P>
 Good kid, too. "No trouble. Not sent to the principal's office . . . " Here 
the coach smiles and says with a certain fondness: "Not often at all." 
</P>
<P>
 McGee had come to Mississippi's Veterans Memorial Stadium, an old chunk of 
concrete near the state capitol in Jackson. Most days the hulk just sits there, 
forlorn while football's elitists preen in finer places named Auburn and 
Athens, Tallahassee and Tuscaloosa. 
</P>
<P>
 That's most days. Not this day, for on this day a thrill moved through the 
place. Never before had Mississippians seen one as good as Steve McNair, and on 
this day they would see Air McNair one more time, likely the last time in 
Mississippi. There were 62,512 people in the old concrete stadium, not a seat 
empty, even the aisles thick with thousands standing to see it. 
</P>
<P>
 What they saw was wonderful. McNair can throw it any way you want it thrown: 
long or short, soft or hard. From the right hash mark, he once threw to the 
left sideline stripe -- an astonishing 40 yards downfield, a pass the pros call 
an "out," which is the ultimate test of a quarterback's arm. 
</P>
<P>
 On this day he also made eight or 10 bad throws, some defiantly into coverage, 
some thrown wild high, a few incomplete because of timing problems with 
receivers. And while those mistakes were real, they were of the sort that will 
be remedied by a quarterback who, with experience, teaching and more talented 
teammates, has the physical tools to be a professional star. 
</P>
<P>
 There is this as well: McNair surely is the fastest quarterback alive. And not 
only straight-ahead fast. He does things only the best running backs do -- such 
as that Barry Sanders sideways hop in which the little guy disappears and 
rematerializes five feet over. McNair dances that dance. On the run, he leaves 
Steve Young a furlong back. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Blakeney coached 12 years at Auburn. He coached Bo Jackson. He now is 
head coach at Troy State. Listen to Blakeney after a 47-44 loss to Alcorn in 
which McNair threw for 476 yards and ran for 110: "Steve McNair is the best 
football player I've ever seen. . . . He'd be the best player on Colorado's 
team or Nebraska's team, too. He'd be the best player on any team in Division 
I-A. He's that good. . . . He can do more to beat you with his abilities than 
anyone else I've ever seen. That includes Bo." 
</P>
<P>
 If that's not enough evidence of McNair's value, this is: Suiting up for the 
big game, Tyler Cleveland, 8 years old, had decisions to make. His father, the 
Jackson sports columnist Rick Cleveland, asked Tyler, "Aren't you going to wear 
your Jackson ballcap?" To which Tyler said, "No, Daddy, I'm for Air." He sat in 
that old concrete ballpark wearing his Air McNair T-shirt.

EX-QUARTERBACK'S LIFE NOW A TALE OF GAMBLING, THEFT; FOOTBALL: ART SCHLICHTER 
WAS A HOMETOWN HERO WHO SEEMED TO HAVE IT ALL. INCLUDING, IT TURNED OUT, AN 
INSATIABLE URGE TO GAMBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM DAHLBERG, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He was the consummate athlete, a straight-arrow Ohio farmboy with an intense 
hatred of losing and an uncanny knack for finding the open receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 Handsome and gregarious, Art Schlichter was a hometown hero who seemed to have 
it all. Including, it turned out, an insatiable urge to gamble. That urge 
ruined his career, cost him his wife and kids and, eventually, cost him his 
freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Schlichter is locked in a spartan jail cell in North Las Vegas, broken 
by a gambling habit that led him to prey on friends, family and even casual 
acquaintances. 
</P>
<P>
 At 34, he could still be a starting quarterback in the NFL, like John Elway. 
Instead, he has agreed in a plea bargain to spend 18 to 24 months in federal 
jail for stealing up to $500,000 to feed the gambling impulses that eventually 
consumed him. Local prosecutors are planning other charges that could add to 
that sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Athletically there wasn't anything he couldn't do," said his father, Max 
Schlichter. "He just couldn't not gamble." 
</P>
<P>
 Schlichter stole from his friends; conned his acquaintances. As the debts 
mounted and the need for a big score increased, he stole $16,500 from his 
wife's sister, according to court documents. It was the final straw for his 
wife, who took their young daughters and left. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the web of lies, stealing and deceit closed in on him, Schlichter 
cashed some final bad checks and made a beeline for an Ohio racetrack. 
</P>
<P>
 His last gamble wasn't much better than the others. His horse didn't come in. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would bet on whether someone would cross the street," said Jerry Kutner, 
owner of the Las Vegas radio station where Schlichter was the host of a popular 
drive-time sports talk show. "He knew every sport, every player. He still 
couldn't win." 
</P>
<P>
 Max Schlichter sat slumped in a plastic chair in the cramped waiting room at 
the North Las Vegas jail, tired and rumpled after a hastily arranged flight the 
night before from Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe he's finally reached rock bottom," Schlichter said. "He's lost his 
wife and his kids. It's finally sinking in. But he's not a criminal. He's just 
a very sick person who can't stop gambling." 
</P>
<P>
 In a few minutes, father and son would have a tearful reunion in the visiting 
area, separated by thick glass and able to talk only by telephone. On advice 
from his lawyers, Schlichter declined to be interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was as great a quarterback as is in the NFL today and he threw it all 
away," Max Schlichter said. "It's a perfect waste of God-given talent." 
</P>
<P>
 Schlichter didn't know his son had a gambling addiction until 1983, when Art, 
threatened by bookies and badly in debt, went to the FBI for help. 
</P>
<P>
 After admitting he bet on at least 10 NFL games during his rookie year in 
1982, Schlichter was suspended by commissioner Pete Rozelle and began the first 
of many attempts at therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doctors believe that Art's condition is under control and that his chances of 
a relapse are minimal," Rozelle said when reinstating Schlichter in June 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 They were wrong. After being released by the Indianapolis Colts in October 
1985, Schlichter was gambling again. By the time he filed for bankruptcy in 
1988, he had listed debts of $1 million and income of only $3,800 the previous 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlichter, though, still had a talent for throwing the football. He led the 
Detroit Drive to an Arena Football League title in 1990, and as late as 1992 
was playing for a semipro team. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could still play today for an expansion team," his father said. "Nobody 
could excite a crowd the way Art could." 
</P>
<P>
 But his effort to get back in the NFL was squelched when Rozelle denied his 
reinstatement appeal in September 1987 after he had signed a contract with the 
Cincinnati Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
 "They let drug addicts have chance after chance after chance, but the NFL 
wouldn't give Art another chance," the father said. "He never reapplied after 
Pete Rozelle embarrassed him. He was afraid they would embarrass him again." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to a gifted right arm, Schlichter had a gift for gab. He used it 
in his second career as a radio talk show host. He used it to get money for 
gambling, often from the same people listening to his show. 
</P>
<P>
 "He could talk better than anybody I ever met," Kutner said. "He had fame and 
a silver tongue, and he parlayed it into cash." 
</P>
<P>
 Schlichter would talk betting lines with his listeners, then try to get their 
home phone numbers so he could call them and pitch one of his many scams. 
</P>
<P>
 Advertisers on the show didn't fare much better. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them, Jeff Day, owned a struggling golf club rental company with 
partner Derrick Hanson, whom Schlichter befriended and defrauded. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he had some advertising money from some guy who was going to pay him 
instead of the owner and wanted Derrick to trade checks for about $5,000," Day 
said. "He got us to write him a check for $5,000 and gave us the other checks. 
Of course, they all bounced." 
</P>
<P>
 Day said his partner had to take out a home equity loan to cover the loss so 
the company could stay afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're sports guys and we knew he was a sports guy," he said. "We were just 
nice trusting Mormon kids. It almost put us out of business." 
</P>
<P>
 Even hardened casino operators were taken by Schlichter. 
</P>
<P>
 One casino lost $12,000 in bad checks; others were taken for thousands more. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took all the normal precautions, he was just very good," said Dean Harold, 
a vice president at Bally's, where Schlichter bounced various checks. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that good, it turns out. Las Vegas got the better of him. Coming here was 
like putting a drunk behind the bar at the neighborhood tavern. 
</P>
<P>
 "I begged him not to move here," said Ron, a longtime friend who asked that 
his last name not be used. "He thought it was the best thing for him because 
then he wouldn't be caught for illegal gambling." 
</P>
<P>
 In a city built on failed gamblers, Schlichter thought he was going to be the 
one who bucked the odds. With his knowledge of sports, he was going to make the 
big score betting on anything involving a ball. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he was one of its biggest losers, playing long-shot parlay bets for 
thousands of dollars with hopes that one big score would set him straight 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just couldn't win," Ron said. "He had the worst beats of any guy I'd ever 
seen. It was like God wouldn't allow him to win." 
</P>
<P>
 At one major Las Vegas Strip sports book, Schlichter was a regular customer 
with a penchant for betting $2,000 on four-team parlays. 
</P>
<P>
 If all his teams covered their respective spreads, he would walk away with 
$22,000. It rarely happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those were sucker bets," said one of the book's managers, who asked not to be 
identified. "He was a sucker playing sucker bets." 
</P>
<P>
 Even on the occasions Schlichter did win, he wasn't rich for long. 
</P>
<P>
 Kutner said Schlichter told him of winning $30,000 early one Sunday morning 
and heading home with the intention of paying off his debts. 
</P>
<P>
 The allure of more action, though, was too much. Sitting in his car at an 
intersection near the Las Vegas Strip, Schlichter turned right instead of left. 
He headed for the blackjack tables at the MGM Grand, where he lost the $30,000 
before the morning sun filled the Las Vegas Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't about money," said Arnie Wexler, a consultant on compulsive 
gambling. "It was about needing and having to be in action. Art had to have the 
action." 
</P>
<P>
 Circumstances, meanwhile, were converging on Schlichter. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Mitzi, had stuck with him for nearly seven years as he struggled 
with his gambling habit, enduring the weeks of no money punctuated by a few 
days of sudden riches. 
</P>
<P>
 By August, however, it was the beginning of the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavily in debt and running short of marks, Schlichter stole and cashed 
$16,500 in checks from his sister-in-law. When she found out, Mitzi gathered up 
their newborn daughter and 4-year-old and went back to Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he got involved with a family member, that was it," Ron said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlichter followed his wife to Ohio, taking an apartment near her in the 
hopes of a reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 He took a job working with a contractor, but the salary wasn't enough. 
Schlichter wrote a $1,150 check Oct. 8 to a grocery store in the Columbus 
suburb of Upper Arlington, and it allegedly bounced, according to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 He went to the racetrack to gamble on one last big payoff. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he went back the last time, he tried to beat the horses," Ron said. "It 
didn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Art ever understood the devastation of this disease," said 
Arnie Wexler, a recovered gambling addict and now a consultant on compulsive 
gambling. "He would be in treatment and then leave. People who are famous or 
think they're different have a hard time getting treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 Wexler said Schlichter, like all gamblers, believed his next bet would be the 
one that would set him up for life. Instead, it plunged him deeper in debt, 
leaving him increasingly desperate for ways to get money. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . Art can't go out and sell his autograph to make money," Wexler said. 
"Art Schlichter had to write a check or con someone out of money." 
</P>
<P>
 And con people, he did. Enough so that prosecutors asked that Schlichter 
remain jailed pending his Jan. 27 sentencing so he couldn't take anyone else 
for money. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy U.S. Attorney John Ham convinced the judge that Schlichter was an 
"economic danger" to those around him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a self-admitted gambling addict which has cost him careers and 
relationships, yet he hasn't gotten counseling," Ham argued. "He uses his 
problem like a credit card to leave a trail of victims. He's blessed with a 
gregarious personality that people find engaging." 
</P>
<P>
 In the jail waiting room, Ron carried new tennis shoes for Schlichter, who 
asked for them long with a book on compulsive gambling and a copy of "On the 
Brink," which chronicles one season with Indiana basketball coach Bob Knight. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me something on the phone last night I had never heard before," Ron 
said. "He said you will never, ever, see me bet any money again." 
</P>
<P>
 Max Schlichter looked warily at his son's friend, not entirely convinced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've heard it all before," he said with a sigh. "I've heard it all before."

 Dick Butkus' career with the Chicago Bears was seemingly over in 1973 because 
of several knee operations. 
</P>
<P>
 However, George Allen, known for his "Over the Hill Gang" with the Washington 
Redskins, still thought that he could use the famous linebacker. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him I couldn't play, but George wouldn't take no for an answer," 
Butkus said. "He insisted that I go to this doctor in Oklahoma City for an 
exam. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was top secret. That was how George did things." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Butkus: The doctor confirmed that Butkus' knees were too far gone to play, 
but that didn't deter Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 "OK," he said, "but could he be ready for next year's playoffs?"

Webber starts hearing his knees crackle like wrapping paper and pains in his 
back keep him on the bench for longer and longer stretches, he might sigh as so 
many fading stars have:  
</P>
<P>
 " 'I'd trade everything for a championship ring.' 
</P>
<P>
 "But last week, at age 21, he made a radical decision. He chose happiness over 
winning." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Webber: Johnette Howard in the Washington Post: "Until Webber's problems 
with Warrior Coach Don Nelson are explained more in depth than they have been 
so far -- a few sideline exchanges, some hurt feelings -- Webber's insistence 
of getting out of Golden State reeks of immaturity."

AUTO RACING; STREAK BY DRIVERS OF INDY CARS IS SNAPPED BY DALE EARNHARDT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HARRIS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dale Earnhardt's selection as the 1994 Driver of the Year ended a string of 
five straight years in which the Indy-car PPG Cup champion had won the 
motorsports version of the Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 Earnhardt, the 1987 Driver of the Year and 1994 NASCAR Winston Cup champion, 
beat out Indy-car champion Al Unser Jr. in the voting by a national panel of 
motorsports writers and broadcasters. 
</P>
<P>
 The last Winston Cup driver to take the annual award was Bill Elliott in his 
championship season of 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Emerson Fittipaldi won in 1989, followed by Unser, Michael Andretti, Bobby 
Rahal and Nigel Mansell. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, NASCAR drivers have won Driver of the Year honors 14 times, Indy-car 
drivers 13 times and Mario Andretti, who has won it three times -- once in each 
of the last decades -- took the honor for his Formula One championship year in 
1978. 
</P>
<P>
 MONEY MONEY: Twenty-three-year-old Jeff Gordon, who finished eighth in the 
Winston Cup standings, wound up No. 1 on the race earnings list with 
$1,607,010, helped considerably by the record $613,000 he pocketed for winning 
the inaugural Brickyard 400 at Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, seven drivers finished the 31-race season with more than $1 million in 
earnings from race purses, the first time that has happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Earnhardt, who also won the $1.25 million bonus from series sponsor 
Winston for taking the title, will get checks totaling more than $3 million on 
Dec. 2 when NASCAR's top stars gather at the Waldorf-Astoria Hotal for the 
annual Awards Banquet. 
</P>
<P>
 He won $1,528,895 from season purses, followed by eight-race winner Rusty 
Wallace with $1,494,620, Ernie Irvan -- who missed the last 11 races while 
recuperating from injuries -- with $1,164,455, Geoff Bodine $1,147,238, series 
runner-up Mark Martin $1,096,236 and Daytona 500 winner Sterling Marlin 
$1,025,310. 
</P>
<P>
 Just missing seven figures in race earnings was Terry Labonte, who won 
$974,845. 
</P>
<P>
 FLYING MILE: Don Miller, president and general manager of Penske Racing South 
is a racer himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who is a partner in the Winston Cup team along with principal owner 
Roger Penske and driver Rusty Wallace, on Nov. 5 established a flying mile 
speed record for Supercharged Flathead Ford Roadsters. 
</P>
<P>
 The former drag racing champion drove his 296-cubic inch V8-powered 1929 
Roadster to a speed of 156.410 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 The record run took place during the FIA-sanctioned East Coast Speed Trials on 
a 2.8-mile course at the former Spence Air Force Base near Moultrie, Ga. He 
beat the previous record of 153.322 set in 1992 at the Bonneville Salt Flats in 
Utah. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's record run had more than the usual excitement, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a dare from Rusty, I made my initial run without using a parachute for 
braking and wound up doing, as they say, some agricultural racing," Miller said 
with a chuckle. "Long story made short is that after being clocked at 153 miles 
per hour, I was 100 yards into a cornfield before I was able to get the car 
stopped. I'm just thankful that Farmer John had harvested his corn or it really 
would have been a hell of a mess." 
</P>
<P>
 MATCHING UP: Everybody knows that trading cards have become a popular 
collector's item for NASCAR fans, but, if TreeHouse Match Co. has any say in 
the matter, its new '94 Autograph Series of racing matchbooks will be the next 
big seller. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first set of matchbooks ever produced for Winston Cup drivers and 
the Charlotte-based company plans to issue a new set each year, just like 
trading cards. 
</P>
<P>
 The '94 set includes 39 different matchbooks with color photos of Winston Cup 
drivers on one side and the drivers' autograph reproduced in gold foil on the 
back. The inside of the matchbooks contain the drivers' racing biography and 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Matchbooks are actually the third most collected item in the world, right 
behind stamps and coins," said Jim McCulloch, president of the company. 
</P>
<P>
 McCulloch is the same man who founded Maxx Race Cards in 1988. A first edition 
Maxx NASCAR set is now valued at close to $1,000 -- and McCulloch says he kept 
only one set. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won't let that happen again,' he said. 
</P>
<P>
 RESTRUCTURING: Dennis Swan, who was crew chief for Al Unser Jr. when he won 
the Indy-car PPG Cup championship in 1990, is the heir apparent to the job of 
competition director held for the past 15 years by Wally Dallenbach. 
</P>
<P>
 Dallenbach, will continue in the job but will train Swan, who has joined 
IndyCar as vice president of logistics, as his eventual successor. 
</P>
<P>
 Kirk Russell, longtime technical director of IndyCar, has been named 
competition vice president and will work with Dallenbach and Swan and will 
continue to direct all racing and technical areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Billy Kamphausen will become director of logistics and Bill Luchow will be 
transportation manager. Both Kamphausen and Luchow have been longtime Indy-car 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 SEARS ON BOARD: Craftsman Tools, a subsidiary of Sears, Roebuck and Co., will 
be the sponsor of the new NASCAR SuperTruck Series, beginning in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The $500,000 SuperTruck series will feature full-sized pickup trucks made 
especially for racing. A 20-race series that will race coast-to-coast, on 18 
different tracks in 15 states, will begin on Feb. 5 at Phoenix International 
Raceway. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the races will be televised with ABC, CBS, ESPN and TNN splitting the 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the original goals set in the early stages of the series was for each 
race to be televised nationally because we knew we had a product that good," 
said Brian France, NASCAR's vice president for marketing and corporate 
communications. "We've achieved that goal, proving other people think we have a 
good product as well."

 THEY TRAIL IN THE POLLS BUT WON'T GIVE UP ELECTION 
</P>
<P>
 Most prognosticators have already given the Heisman Trophy to Colorado running 
back Rashaan Salaam, who has 2,046 rushing yards, but that doesn't mean Penn 
State's Ki-Jana Carter and Alcorn State's Steve McNair have written concession 
speeches. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter, who rushed for 107 yards and three touchdowns last Saturday, gained 
227 yards and scored five touchdowns in a 59-31 victory over Michigan State on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter has 1,539 rushing yards and 23 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 McNair, barely able to run because of an injured hamstring, threw 82 passes, 
completing 52 for 514 yards, in a 63-20 loss to Youngstown State on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 McNair finished the season with 4,903 passing yards and 904 rushing yards and 
nine touchdowns. HE'S MISSING AN ARM, BUT ONLY FOES ARE HANDICAPPED 
</P>
<P>
 DaWuan Miller, a defensive back who has only one arm, made the key 
interception as Boise State rallied for a 24-20 victory over North Texas in the 
opening round of the Division I-AA playoffs in Boise, Ida. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 3-ranked Boise State trailed, 20-17, with less than six minutes left when 
Miller intercepted a pass from North Texas quarterback Mitch Maher and returned 
it to the six-yard line. Tailback Willie Bowens scored on a pass from 
quarterback Tony Hilde on the next play to give Boise State a school-record 
11th victory this season. THIS EXCUSE ALONE SHOULD DROP NEBRASKA IN POLLS 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, No. 1 Nebraska looked awful in defeating winless Iowa State, 28-12, on 
Nov. 12. True, the Cornhuskers didn't look much better in defeating Oklahoma, 
13-3, on Friday. And yes, No. 2 Penn State trounced Michigan State, 59-31, on 
Saturday. But the Cornhuskers don't want voters in the top 25 polls getting any 
ideas about vaulting the Nittany Lions ahead of them this week. 
</P>
<P>
 They say that Iowa State and Oklahoma were difficult opponents because their 
coaches, Jim Walden and Gary Gibbs, had both announced their resignations, 
effective at season's end. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see any other team in the country come in here and play Oklahoma 
when their coach is quitting," said Nebraska offensive lineman Zach Wiegert. 
"They are a really tough ballclub, and they had the extra inspiration today." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Nebraska linebacker Ed Stewart: "We've played under tough circumstances 
for two weeks in a row." HE'S NO BUDDY RYAN WHEN IT COMES TO BOASTS 
</P>
<P>
 Penn State's Joe Paterno was uncharacteristically upbeat about his team after 
the victory over Michigan State. His view of the race for No. 1: 
</P>
<P>
 "Nebraska's got a tough game to play, we've got a tough game to play and 
Alabama's got two tough games to play. A lot can happen. But it's hard for me 
to believe that anybody can beat us." 
</P>
<P>
 That's bad news for Oregon in the Rose Bowl. AND WHERE WERE YOU FOR THE FIRST 
99 GAMES? 
</P>
<P>
 North Dakota-North Dakota State probably won't make many lists of top college 
football rivalries, but the two schools met for the 100th time when they played 
in the NCAA Division II playoffs on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 A sellout crowd of 10,060 at North Dakota's Memorial Stadium in Grand Forks 
witnessed the game, the first between the rivals in the playoffs. For the 
record, the Fighting Sioux won, 14-7. For those who missed the first 99 games, 
the Fighting Sioux is North Dakota's nickname. CHARITY BEGINS AT HOME, OR IN 
PLYMOUTH, N.H. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a good thing Joe Dudek wasn't around to see this. 
</P>
<P>
 Dudek gained 5,570 yards for Plymouth State from 1982-85, good enough for 
fifth on the NCAA career rushing list coming into this season. Dudek's alma 
mater needed him Saturday, losing five fumbles and having five passes 
intercepted in a 22-7 loss to Ithaca in the NCAA Division III East Regional 
final in Plymouth, N.H. AND THERE'S A REASON YOUR TEAM IS NOT 
</P>
<P>
 Nevada Las Vegas Coach Jeff Horton was philosophical about his team's 42-3 
loss to 11th-ranked Kansas State. "There's a reason they're ranked," Horton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second meeting between the two teams. The Wildcats won the first 
meeting last season, 36-20. HE MADE EVERY ONE COUNT 
</P>
<P>
 Washington and Jefferson quarterback Jason Baer completed only 11 passes in a 
second-round NCAA Division III playoff game against Widenerin Washington, Pa. 
But four of the passes went for touchdowns as Baer led a 37-21 victory. THE TOP 
25 
</P>
<P>
 * No. 1 NEBRASKA (11-0): Defeated Oklahoma, 13-3. Get ready for a barrage of 
will he or won't he play in the Orange Bowl speculation about Cornhusker 
quarterback Tommy Frazier, whose blood-clot condition has improved. 
</P>
<P>
 * No. 2 PENN STATE (11-0): Defeated Michigan State, 59-31. What to get that 
Nittany Lion on your Christmas list? Try an Alabama loss to Florida in the 
Southeastern Conference title game and a Nebraska loss in the Orange Bowl. And 
some dead Ducks Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 * No. 3 ALABAMA (11-0): Idle. 
</P>
<P>
 * No. 4 FLORIDA (9-1-1): Tied Florida State, 31-31. Does this mean Florida's 
Terry Dean, the deposed quarterback and not-too-long ago Heisman candidate, 
gets the last laugh? Would Dean have produced more than seven points in the 
second half? 
</P>
<P>
 * No. 5 MIAMI (10-1): Defeated Boston College, 23-7. Things keep falling in 
place for the Hurricanes, who should move up to fourth this week and need a 
couple bowl breaks to finish No. 1. It isn't over yet. 
</P>
<P>
 * No. 6 COLORADO (10-1): Idle. 
</P>
<P>
 * No. 7 FLORIDA STATE (9-1-1): Tied Florida, 31-31. Don't feel too badly for 
Seminoles. Atlantic Coast Conference title guarantees them a top bowl bid and 
they were lucky to tie Gators. But why didn't they go for two? 
</P>
<P>
 * No. 8 TEXAS A&M (10-0-1): Idle. Aggies will begin the new year watching 6-5 
Texas Tech playing in Cotton Bowl while they are on an NCAA-mandated vacation. 
Cheating sometimes carries a high price. 
</P>
<P>
 * No. 9 AUBURN (9-1-1): Idle. See Texas A&M entry, although Tigers would have 
gone to a smaller bowl because of their loss to Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 * No. 10 COLORADO STATE (10-1): Idle. 
</P>
<P>
 * No. 11 KANSAS STATE (9-2): Defeated Nevada Las Vegas, 42-3. The Wildcats 
finish impressively; now if only a bowl official somewhere will notice they 
deserve better than the Aloha. 
</P>
<P>
 * No. 12 OREGON (9-3): Idle. 
</P>
<P>
 * No. 13 VIRGINIA (8-3): Lost to North Carolina State, 30-27, Friday. The 
Cavaliers ruin their chances of playing on Jan. 2 and make a mess of the bowl 
picture. Thanks for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 * No. 14 OHIO STATE (9-3): Idle. 
</P>
<P>
 * No. 15 UTAH (9-2): Idle. 
</P>
<P>
 * No. 16 ARIZONA (8-3): Defeated Arizona State, 28-27, Friday. The Wildcats 
were very fortunate to escape with a victory. Quarterback Dan White injured his 
shoulder in the first half but was able to return. 
</P>
<P>
 * No. 17 USC (7-3-1) Tied Notre Dame, 17-17. Who would ever think that the key 
play in the Notre Dame game would be turned in by a Nigerian? But without 
Israel Ifeanyi's blocked field-goal attempt, Trojans might not have tied. 
</P>
<P>
 * No. 18 VIRGINIA TECH (8-3): Idle. 
</P>
<P>
 * No. 19 MISSISSIPPI STATE (8-3): Defeated Mississippi, 21-17. Fact of the 
day: This is only the second time in five decades that Bulldogs have won 
consecutive games against Rebels. The Bulldogs won in 1976 and 1977, but those 
victories were later forfeited. 
</P>
<P>
 * No. 20 MICHIGAN (7-4): Idle. 
</P>
<P>
 * No. 21 NORTH CAROLINA (8-3): Idle. 
</P>
<P>
 * No. 22 SYRACUSE (7-4): Lost to West Virginia, 13-0, Thursday. The Orangemen 
have been impossible to figure this season and their loss to the Mountaineers 
continues that trend. 
</P>
<P>
 * No. 23 BRIGHAM YOUNG (9-3): Idle.  
</P>
<P>
 * No. 24 WASHINGTON STATE (7-4): Idle. 
</P>
<P>
 * No. 25 BOSTON COLLEGE (6-4-1): Lost to Miami, 23-7. The Eagles led, 7-3, at 
halftime but couldn't sustain the upset bid. Hope they have a good time in 
Hawaii. INJURY REPORT 
</P>
<P>
 Tennessee running back Aaron Hayden broke his right leg when tackled 30 
seconds before halftime of a 65-0 victory over Vanderbilt at Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors planned to operate Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior from Detroit was making his final regular season appearance and 
carried 14 times for 77 yards. That ranks him sixth on Tennessee's all-time 
list with 2,061 yards. OF TWO COACHES ON OUTS, AT LEAST ONE WANTS BACK IN 
</P>
<P>
 George Perles' last game as coach of Michigan State won't be his last game 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to sit at home and retire, that's for sure," he said after the 
Spartans' 51-39 loss to Penn State. "The only thing I'm looking for is some 
opportunities that would keep me in football or around football." 
</P>
<P>
 Perles finished his 12-year career at Michigan State with a 73-62-4 record. He 
was forced to resign after starting the year 2-5. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Saturday, Louisiana State ended the regime of coach Curley Hallman with a 
30-12 victory over Arkansas. Hallman was fired before LSU's victory last week 
against Tulane. The Tigers, 4-7 overall and 3-5 in the Southeastern Conference, 
were 16-28 during Hallman's four years. The Bowl Picture 
</P>
<P>
 You call this a picture? Alabama and Florida are still the biggest dominoes to 
be played, and after its tie against USC, Notre Dame is free to travel wherever 
it can get an invitation. This should clear up by next weekend, but who wants

COMMENTARY; A FUNNY THING HAPPENED TO BLAKE EN ROUTE TO CFL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE LUPICA, NEWSDAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Jets cut Jeff Blake on Sunday, Aug. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 He had been living in a dorm at Hofstra University, where the Jets train. He 
got into a car the next morning and drove from Long Island to York, Pa., where 
his mother-in-law lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake had been a college football star once. There are a lot of those who 
never make it and end up taking this ride out of town. He was two years out of 
college, and he was out of work. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past month, Jeff Blake is a football star all over again, the sudden 
and improbable star of the Bengals. They write rap songs about him in 
Cincinnati and call him "Shake 'n' Blake" and can't make T-shirts with his 
picture on them fast enough. The trip to all that, the kind of trip you can 
still make with enough talent and enough luck, began Monday morning, Aug. 29. 
Even when so much is wrong with sports, something wonderful can still show up 
out of nowhere and make you stand up and cheer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was alone in that car, I'd lost my job, and I had a lot of time to think," 
Blake was saying Tuesday (November 15) night from Cincinnati. "And I kept 
thinking the same thing: How am I going to support my family?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping I'd be able to somehow catch on in the Canadian Football 
League," Blake continued. "I knew there'd been some interest, and my father 
(former Toronto Argonaut Emory Blake) had played up there. But I'd never been 
cut in my life. All of a sudden, I didn't know what to believe anymore. Except 
I still believed this: I was good enough to play in the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
 He got to York early in the afternoon. Ralph Cindrich, his agent, called. 
Cindrich said the Bengals were interested in signing him. Bruce Coslet, who had 
been Blake's coach with the Jets, was now offensive coordinator with the 
Bengals, and Coslet had always liked Blake, as a player and as a person. At 5 
p.m., Bengals coach David Shula called York, Pa. By 6:30, Blake was on a plane 
out of Harrisburg. He was in Cincinnati as a Bengal at 9:30 p.m., 12 hours 
after leaving Hofstra. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like Bruce Coslet choreographed this thing right from the start," 
Cindrich said Wednesday. "Now, if Bruce told Jeff to walk across the Ohio 
River, the kid would start walking." 
</P>
<P>
 Blake was supposed to be third string in Cincinnati. But a month ago, David 
Klingler got hurt against the Browns and so did his backup, Donald Hollas. The 
Bengals' record went to 0-7 that day. The next week, Blake was the starter 
against the Cowboys. He threw for 247 yards and the Bengals lost, 23-20, even 
though they had led 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The next week, Blake threw for 387 yards and the Bengals got their first 
victory, against the Seahawks. Last week, Blake threw for 354 yards and four 
touchdowns against the Oilers, and the Bengals won again. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was sitting on the bench with the Jets, then with the Bengals, I 
always pictured myself on the field," he said. "I'd look at film of other guys 
and see myself throwing the touchdown passes. It was always just a question of 
me getting in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 He always believed he had games like this in him, even on cutdown day, when he 
took the Long Island Expressway to the New Jersey Turnpike, then picked up Rt. 
78 outside of Newark, and finally 83 South, and thought all these roads might 
be taking him away from the NFL for good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love to prove people wrong," Blake said. "People doubted me because I come 
from a small school like East Carolina. People said I was too small (6-0). I 
started to think I'd be another statistic, another guy who never got a chance 
to play in the NFL." Blake paused. "Listen, I understand the Jets made a 
business decision. But at least give me a chance. Give me a shot before you cut 
me. If I'd had a shot and then I blew it, you wouldn't have heard any 
complaints from me. But they didn't do that. I felt like they'd made up their 
mind before training camp even began." 
</P>
<P>
 So the 23-year-old quarterback, who would be the most exciting quarterback in 
New York, now plays in Cincinnati and makes $162,000 a year. Most NFL 
quarterbacks make millions. Boomer Esiason does. Esiason has 1,686 passing 
yards for the whole season. Dave Brown has 1,503 passing yards. Jeff Blake, who 
is no more experienced than Brown is, has nearly 1,000 passing yards already, 
and six touchdown passes, and just one interception. Maybe Charlie Ward could 
have been this kind of quarterback in the NFL if all the geniuses hadn't 
thought he was too small. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's just another guy who'd never gotten a chance to show what he could do on 
the field with the real guys," Coslet said. "His rookie year with the Jets, we 
were getting Browning (Nagle) ready. Last year, it was Boomer. It looked like 
it was going to be the same situation here. Then the guys ahead of Jeff got 
hurt, and he was finally out there with the real guys. He's made the most of an 
opportunity, and a lot of guys don't do that. And in the process, he's brought 
some life and hope to Cincinnati, where there wasn't any life or hope at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Blake brought the Bengals from behind four times. This was the same 
Oilers defense against which the 8-2 Browns scored 11 points and the 7-3 
Steelers scored 12 points. During the game, Blake suffered a badly bruised 
ankle. He went in to have the ankle X-rayed, came riding back on a golf cart, 
got off the cart and immediately threw a 34-yard completion to Harold Green and 
a 33-yard completion to Carl Pickens. The plays set up the field goal that won 
the game for the Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
 "God works in mysterious ways," Blake said. "When they were looking at my 
ankle, the Oilers had the ball the whole time. When I got back to the field, it 
was exactly the right time for me to get back into the game." 
</P>
<P>
 He has just come from another late night at Riverfront Stadium, going over 
Sunday's game plan with Coslet, looking at more film. In the background, you 
could hear laughter from Blake's wife and their two children as she tried to 
bathe them. The season is much better in November than it was at the end of 
August, for all of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, people are pulling for me because I'm the understudy-type guy," he 
said. "I feel like I'm playing for all the understudy-type guys, all the 
backups who never got a chance to show what they could do. You put in your 
time, and then some guy who's never played a minute but gets drafted No. 1 or 
No. 2 automatically gets your job, and your dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 His father never made it to the NFL. Jeff Blake says he is living out his 
father's dreams as well. "I'm letting him walk proud," he said. The T-shirts 
they are selling in Cincinnati show Blake coming up out of Riverfront Stadium, 
with the earth opening up underneath the stadium and lightning in the sky. 
Sometimes it still happens this way for the understudy-type guy. They give him 
a shot and he lights up the sky. The dreams do not always end up in the 
rearview mirror.

REPEAT OFFENDERS; TROUBLE FOLLOWS SOME GUYS AROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HAL BOCK, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trouble just seems to follow some guys around. Ask Dennis Rodman. Or Andre 
Rison. Or Dexter Manley. Or Art Schlichter. 
</P>
<P>
 These are guys who've been given chance after chance after chance, only to get 
in mess after mess after mess, perhaps betrayed by talent so great it's made 
their bosses reluctant to crack down on them. 
</P>
<P>
 All four had their pasts catch up with them recently, bringing them jams 
ranging from suspension to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodman is in trouble with the San Antonio Spurs, something about not following 
team rules. Why are the Detroit Pistons not surprised? 
</P>
<P>
 Rodman was a migraine headache in gym shorts during his days with the Pistons. 
His shenanigans made the front office so nuts that player personnel boss Billy 
McKinney, knowing Rodman wanted out, once threatened to keep him around, just 
for spite. 
</P>
<P>
 His escape to San Antonio, went smoothly for all of one season before a new 
administration got these quaint ideas about following team rules. Dye your hair 
any color you want. Just don't throw ice at the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "If his mind is on basketball," teammate Avery Johnson said, "it's a sharp 
mind, very intense, very good for the people around him. If not, well . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Rison got himself suspended by the Atlanta Falcons last week. Seems 
he was late for, oh, 20 or so team meetings. And he couldn't understand why 
management got so bent out of shape over that. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I don't deserve being suspended," he told Fox Sports. "I feel as 
though I shouldn't have been suspended because of some of the things other 
players have done that are more detrimental to our team. Coaches know it and 
they still don't take action. Then I'm a minute, two minutes, late to a special 
team meeting and you suspend me?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, yes, after the 20th time. 
</P>
<P>
 Rison, remember, also had problems at his first NFL stop in Indianapolis. Is 
there a trend here? 
</P>
<P>
 Now here we have two extremely talented athletes. Rodman has led the NBA in 
rebounding for three straight years. Nobody has caught more passes in the first 
five years of a career than Rison. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, trouble keeps following them around. 
</P>
<P>
 There are others, with more serious problems, who are part of the recidivist 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Manley played in three Super Bowls and had 97 career sacks, fourth best in NFL 
history. He also had this nasty drug habit. Three years ago, he confessed to a 
setback and was suspended for the second time from the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am in trouble and I must renew my battle with this disease," he said at the 
time. "The battle in football is a game, the battle for my life is not. I may 
have lost a battle, but I will win the war." 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, in his autobiography, Manley wrote how he "gave up a 
$650,000-a-year contract for a lousy $20 worth of cocaine." 
</P>
<P>
 "Drugs rob you of your credibility and your morals. They make you a liar and a 
cheat. It takes time to get that back. I want to show recovery can work." 
</P>
<P>
 All the right words. All the proper sentiments. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week in Houston, Dexter Manley got busted for felony possession of crack 
cocaine. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlichter came out of Ohio State as a can't-miss quarterback prospect. He 
missed. The problem: Gambling. 
</P>
<P>
 Schlichter, one observer suggested, would bet on which of two people would get 
across the street first. He'd love those dot races that ball parks use to amuse 
fans between innings. 
</P>
<P>
 After gambling finished him in football, Schlichter worked as a radio talk 
show host in, of all places for an addicted gambler, Las Vegas. He pleaded 
guilty last week to a federal charge of bank fraud -- writing bad checks. 
</P>
<P>
 When his addiction was diagnosed, Schlichter was treated at South Oaks 
Hospital in Amityville, N.Y., where Dr. Sheila B. Blume is medical director of 
the alcoholism, chemical dependency and compulsive gambling unit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Relapsing is very much a part of addictive disorders," she said. "That is why 
a single treatment, in-patient or out-patient, is never considered a cure. A 
very important part of treatment is that recovery is a lifelong endeavor. Once 
professional treatment is done, self-help groups like Alcoholics Anonymous and 
Gamblers Anonymous are important. It's the kind of disease that if you forget 
about it, it will sneak up when you're not looking. 
</P>
<P>
 "For someone who is clean a year or two, relapse is less frequent." 
</P>
<P>
 Dwight Gooden was clean for seven years before he started fouling testing 
bottles -- perhaps as many as 10 times -- last summer. "I had an alcoholic 
patient who relapsed after 14 years," Blume said. "The condition can be 
arrested. It never is cured. The one bet, the one cocktail, the one hit of 
crack opens the door. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like riding a bicycle. Once the system learns, it never forgets."

GAME ENDS UP A TIE, HOLTZ ENDS UP LOST; IRISH: COACH, LOOKING FOR ANSWERS, ALSO 
HAS TO SEARCH FOR A PLACE TO HOLD A TEAM MEETING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS DUFRESNE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As if tying USC wasn't bad enough, and finishing 6-4-1, and waiting now for, 
gulp, the Sun Bowl to call, Notre Dame Coach Lou Holtz had a heartfelt 
post-game pep talk all rehearsed and no place to give it. 
</P>
<P>
 You think that ever happened to Rockne? 
</P>
<P>
 The 66th meeting of this running series may have ended without resolution, a 
17-17 tie at the Coliseum on Saturday, but it was not without its drama. 
</P>
<P>
 Holtz, who couldn't quite pull the trigger on a crucial fourth-down, 
fourth-quarter situation, did manage to steal the postgame show and set the 
psychological stage for next season. 
</P>
<P>
 In a move normally reserved for visiting junior college teams with a running 
bus waiting, Holtz called his team back out of the Coliseum's west-end tunnel 
after the game and huddled the Irish on the 30-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Holtz claimed the visitor's lockers weren't large enough for a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no where to meet here," Holtz said later. "I looked down into the 
showers. You tell me where to meet? There were some things I wanted to share 
and I didn't want to walk out of here without sharing them." 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame left a lot of questions out on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irish's 11-game winning streak against the Trojans was over, and Holtz 
might have only himself to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 With seven minutes remaining, and a seven-point lead, and his team driving 
into a head wind, Holtz made the call that usually decides games such as these. 
</P>
<P>
 It was fourth and two at the USC 20. A field goal puts Notre Dame up by 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "They would have needed two scores," Holtz said. 
</P>
<P>
 A coach was torn. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players wanted to go for it, and I probably should have," Holtz said. "I 
felt it was the right thing to do at the time. It turns out it wasn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Stefan Schroffner's 37-yard field-goal attempt was met at the line of 
scrimmage by the long arm of Israel Ifeanyi, who blocked the kick and watched 
teammate Sammy Knight scoop up the ball and run 56 yards to Irish 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Five plays later, the score was tied. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Sample, a Notre Dame linebacker, knew what he would have done. "As a 
defense, we're always pushing them to go for it," he said. "But who am I to 
question the coach?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Powlus, the quarterback, knew what he would have done. "Being on offense, 
the players want to go for it," he said. "But I'm not going to question it." 
</P>
<P>
 Powlus had enough to worry about in his first season as the second-coming of 
Joe Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 A tie against USC and 6-4-1 doesn't get it done. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many things I wish I could have changed," said Powlus, who 
completed 13 of 22 passes for 115 yards and one touchdown. "My rookie season at 
a lot of places would have been all right. But it's just not acceptable for 
myself or Notre Dame." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor are ties against a team your school has beaten 11 consecutive seasons. 
Powlus said afterward that the game felt like a loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "It might as well be," the quarterback said. "A win would have lifted our 
season. This didn't do anything for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Except, perhaps, make Notre Dame make another decision about whether to accept 
a bowl bid with six victories. There were years the Irish would have 
respectfully declined, deeming themselves unworthy for consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 But with Notre Dame's drawing power and name recognition, you can bet the 
bowls will come calling. 
</P>
<P>
 Holtz, in his postgame news conference, was acting as though he was saying 
goodby to 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe we're going to a bowl," he said. "I don't know, that's up to 
the University of Notre Dame." 
</P>
<P>
 The players, of course, don't want the season to end like this. But does Notre 
Dame go to just any bowl? 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to go to a Jan. 1 bowl," linebacker Jeremy Nau said. "I've heard maybe 
the Cotton, but basically, my feeling is, I want to play in prime time. The Sun 
Bowl, all those, are great and all that, but we're Notre Dame. We had our 
hearts set on the Fiesta or the Sugar. It just didn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happens, the season will not have been a total loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "They still haven't beaten us in 12 years," Powlus said of USC. "The streak, 
it's still there, sort of."

RECORD-BREAKING CAREER LITTLE CONSOLATION FOR JOHNSON; TROJANS: THE USC 
QUARTERBACK COMES UP VERY SHORT (0-5-1) IN BIG GAMES AGAINST UCLA, IRISH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Afterward, save for what is offered in the bowl season, Rob Johnson walked off 
the Coliseum field with every passing record that means anything at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Passes thrown, completions, touchdowns . . . . everything, including most 
mentions in the Trojan record book. 
</P>
<P>
 He also left with a 0-5-1 record as a starter in games that matter at USC: 0-3 
against UCLA, 0-2-1 against Notre Dame. 
</P>
<P>
 Put the records and the record on a scale. They don't balance. Ask the people 
who booed his presentation by Coach John Robinson to the traditional 
season-ending gathering of the student body. They were quickly overwhelmed by 
cheering supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got 2 minutes 47 seconds," said Robinson, perhaps overtiming the cheers, 
but nobody had pulled a watch to dispute him. 
</P>
<P>
 And the boos? "The rest of them don't count." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson accepted it as just another day as a Trojan.  
</P>
<P>
 "I was surprised they cheered at all," he said. "I didn't have a very good 
second half." 
</P>
<P>
 His first half wasn't all that bad. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson worked a soft spot in the Notre Dame defense early, hitting Terry 
Barham, Tyler Cashman and Keyshawn Johnson with passes over the middle, in 
front of defensive backs determined to prevent big plays. 
</P>
<P>
 He threw his 55th touchdown pass -- breaking Rodney Peete's mark -- on a 
five-yard pass to Johnny McWilliams in the second quarter to to give USC a 7-3 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 At halftime, he was 13 of 18 for 157 yards and had been sacked but once. He 
played the game in spurts, completing six passes in a row, missing six in a 
row, then completing six more in a row. He finished 15 of 29 for 187 yards and 
a touchdown. He also threw an interception and was willing to accept that a 
17-17 tie against Notre Dame might make you want a play or two back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Which play do you think?" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly it was the interception in the third quarter with USC driving, 
second down 14 yards to go on the Notre Dame 16. 
</P>
<P>
 As the play unfolded, he was staring at Keyshawn Johnson, whose company was 
being passed from Ivory Covington to Brian Magee in the zone defense. Keyshawn 
was never open and, as he is wont to do, Rob Johnson held the ball too long. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to throw it away and I was hit as I threw," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Having divested himself of Keyshawn Johnson, Covington was hard upon USC's 
Leonard Green, a back who had gone upfield to help out in the pass pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 Covington intercepted at his nine, and Notre Dame's lead was upheld at 17-10. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't last. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither did Johnson's streak against Notre Dame. He's still winless, but. . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it's better to tie than to lose, but as seniors we didn't want to go 
out with a tie," he said, tentatively. 
</P>
<P>
 So, what about the tie? "It (stinks)," he admitted. 
</P>
<P>
 Teammate Tony Boselli was more forthcoming. 
</P>
<P>
 "It feels empty," he said. "This is awful. It's just empty." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, but there was a positive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't play the best we can play, but we played better than we did last 
week," Johnson said. Last week was a 31-19 loss to UCLA, finishing Johnson's 
career against the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the Irish, there was a desire to beat somebody -- anybody -- among 
USC's rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 The chance was there in the fourth quarter, with 2:22 to play and the ball at 
the USC 48. A run for Shawn Walters gained two yards, but then Johnson was 
sacked by Jeremy Sample. On third and 14, Johnson faded back and tripped over 
Walters, losing four yards and prompting a John Stonehouse punt. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an ignominious ending to a regular-season career at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 It also ended a day that began with teammates watching Florida play Florida 
State, perhaps even scouting a potential Sugar Bowl opponent in the Gators. 
</P>
<P>
 "When that game ended in a tie, we said that it would be great to get an extra 
period, like in the pros, to decide it," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Little did he know how much he could have used it only hours later.

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; EYED BY THE BIRDS AND THEN GORED BY THE BULLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Noon in the Sports Arena, the Clippers shooting around before that night's 
game against the Chicago Bulls, everyone bundled up against the meat-locker 
chill, a couple of birds swooping around. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at that," Coach Bill Fitch marvels, "birds!" 
</P>
<P>
 Buzzards looking for a Clipper's shoulder to alight on? Chickens coming home 
to roost? 
</P>
<P>
 They're actually only swallows, but two weeks into the regular season, Fitch 
is beginning to feel as if he has seen everything. 
</P>
<P>
 His players have been manhandled early. They have collapsed late. They have 
neglected to win, making the Clippers -- finally! -- a story to fire the 
nation's imagination as they challenge the Philadelphia 76ers' 9-73 futility 
record. Count this as bad timing for Fitch, who inherited this mess, and the 
players, who bear ridicule more appropriately directed upstairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The players are mostly young guys getting their first NBA shots. If none looks 
like the next Danny Manning -- or Chris Webber, to use a name that still causes 
the basketball side of the organization to wince -- some may develop into good 
NBA players. 
</P>
<P>
 Upper management, on the other hand, bought and paid for this season in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Who can ever forget last season's performance? 
</P>
<P>
 October: Clippers call off their deal sending Manning to Miami for Glen Rice 
and Willie Burton. Owner Donald T. Sterling insists he will persuade Manning to 
stay. 
</P>
<P>
 February: Clippers pass up an Orlando offer that includes two No. 1 picks, 
trade Manning to Atlanta for 34-year-old free-agent-to-be Dominique Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
 July: Wilkins signs with the Boston Celtics. The Clippers, who acknowledged 
having known Wilkins' asking price -- a $21-million contract -- before trading 
for him, offered $10 million. 
</P>
<P>
 When Fitch was hired last summer, Elgin Baylor was trotted out to say the 
Clippers understood they'd made mistakes. Sterling ordered the organization to 
undergo a painful self-evaluation, but a couple of hard truths must have 
escaped notice. 
</P>
<P>
 The front office is still on the same merry-go-round ride to nowhere. Two 
weeks ago, the basketball people were all for jumping into the Webber chase. 
The Clippers had the league's biggest slot -- Wilkins' $3.5 million -- and had 
been invited by Fallasha Erwin, one of Webber's agents, to tender an offer 
sheet. 
</P>
<P>
 Webber wanted a $77-million, nine-year deal with an out clause in two seasons. 
Of course, Webber's people were only trying to leverage the Golden State 
Warriors. On the other hand, the Clippers had nothing to lose. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative died somewhere between the office of Executive Vice President 
Andy Roeser and Sterling's swank rooftop suite in Beverly Hills. The basketball 
people still don't know who killed it or why, but one way or another, the arrow 
points to Sterling. Roeser's chief job is to front for The Donald. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Clippers don't know, or have failed to articulate what they did 
wrong, here it is: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Their failure lies in their inability to establish a program the 
participants can believe in. 
</P>
<P>
 Even now as they trumpet a new beginning and Fitch's old-fashioned virtues, 
they're drawing crowds of 5,000. It says "an announced 7,500" in the paper but 
that's because the Clippers are so fond of their fans, they count them all 1 
1/2 times. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Their name strikes terror into the hearts of players. Danny Ferry fled to 
Europe rather than play for them. Players too numerous to mention served out 
their contracts like sentences and forced trades or bolted via free agency. 
Wayman Tisdale turned down a $2.5-million offer from them to work for $850,000 
in Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Next spring, when some undergraduate like Corliss Wiliamson is wondering if he 
should come out, the Clippers may get the No. 1 pick . . . and Williamson might 
start thinking Fayetteville, Ark., is looking better all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer begins with a move to Anaheim, a city that, bless its heart, wants 
them. The first game at The Pond sold out and the other five are close. The 
Clippers have an option in their lease to leave. There will be no public outcry 
in Los Angeles County, which barely marked their arrival and could regard their 
exit only as a civic improvement. The Clipper organization, with the exception 
of one man, regards a move as inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Sterling wants to stay put, Roeser will be obliged to whip out yet 
another set of plans for the long-proposed new stadium around L.A. Where's the 
next site, the La Brea Tar Pits? PERFECT! 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Clipper pack up the balls and the memories and move their 
cellar-dwelling selves down the freeway, they had better learn how to back up 
the professionals or they can challenge the 76ers' record every season. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, I could be wrong. The Clippers are free to prove it by drawing some 
people to the Sports Arena who don't come dressed as empty seats. HIT THE ROAD, 
CHRIS, AND DON'T LOOK BACK 
</P>
<P>
 Fallout from the Webber deal, received morosely by Warrior players and fans 
alike, continues to sprinkle the Bay Area. Even Coach Don Nelson, who did it, 
didn't try to put a happy face on it. With Webber, the Warriors were a 
potential monster. With Tom Gugliotta, they're merely a contender. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Webber's protestations he's a power forward, at 6 feet 10 and 250 
pounds, with massive shoulders and long arms, he's bigger than Alonzo Mourning. 
Wherever they lined him up, he was a shot-blocker, a low-post threat and a 
force. 
</P>
<P>
 Gugliotta is only a good player. He averaged 17 points as the Washington 
Bullets' No. 1 option. When Chris Mullin comes back, Gugliotta will be the 
Warriors' No. 4 option. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Webber's obstinacy, questions remain: 
</P>
<P>
 -- How come Nelson never called to see if they could straighten it out man to 
man? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I did think about it," Nelson said. "It was just that I was not 
involved in the negotiations and I wasn't asked to make that call and they were 
talking about my situation and Chris' situation within the negotiations. And I 
think both sides felt better that the call wasn't made." 
</P>
<P>
 Comment: Huh? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Why did the Warriors cave in? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer might lie in Nelson's long-held determination not to work with 
jerks. Webber wasn't one, but Nelson had never had to go, hat in hand, to one 
of his players and might not have been eager to start. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Warrior players, reaction was muted and downcast. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Jose Mercury-News reported that Tim Hardaway, team leader and a Nelson 
mainstay, walked right past Nellie the day the trade was announced, refusing to 
acknowledge his coach's greeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not talking," Hardaway said later. 
</P>
<P>
 Told he looked upset, Hardaway replied, "If that's the impression y'all take, 
then that's the impression y'all take." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Latrell Sprewell: "We have some guys who can make plays, but to me it's 
not going to be the same. (Webber) is one of those players that are gifted. He 
can do a lot. It's something you can't teach. I don't think there's anyone 
better at finishing, other than Shaquille O'Neal. He was a player that can get 
the crowd involved." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Webber said so many things, it was hard to tell what he was, 
other than a headstrong young man who got too much advice and got in over his 
head. 
</P>
<P>
 Caught in the willful act, he yelped in surprise, even calling a talk-radio 
station in his hometown of Detroit, where people were ripping him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't believe what's going on," Webber said. "The people of Detroit are 
missing the point." 
</P>
<P>
 Someone was, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Before leaving the Bay Area, Webber told the Mercury-News' Ric Bucher: 
</P>
<P>
 "To the fans, I don't have anything against them, but I have no love for Don 
Nelson. This is all his doing and no one else's. It's all about a coach who has 
been intimidated by a contract. I think it's been in the works to trade me for 
a long time. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like (he and Juwan Howard) loved each other so much that I have to 
follow him (to Washington). It's going to be a difficult year. I'm not going to 
win 50 games. It'll be difficult getting acclimated. They're not a good team, 
but we'll win a championship if I stay there for a couple of years. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I just learned my way around here. Now I'm going to have to live in a hotel 
for a couple of months, I'm going to have to learn my way around again, all the 
while I'm getting to know a new team. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole Dream Team II hates (Nelson). The Warriors are going to have 
trouble every time they play one of the guys from that team. I know Derrick 
Coleman, Steve Smith, Dominique. They all want to get back at him." 
</P>
<P>
 To be young is to mess up. 
</P>
<P>
 Webber remains one of the league's most talented and engaging young players 
but at this point, it would be better if he zipped it up until he has actually 
done something. Maybe just for that "couple of years" it'll take to raise the 
championship banner in Landover. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson's problems go beyond having the Derrick Colemans of this world after 
him. Having some of those guys hate you suggests you were on the side of the 
angels all along. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson's problem is what might have been and is no more and how to go on from 
there. FACES AND FIGURES 
</P>
<P>
 Big trouble in New York, where Patrick Ewing's right knee, on which he had 
arthroscopic surgery last summer, is swelling again -- suggesting he came back 
too soon. In his first seven games, Ewing averaged three fewer rebounds than 
last season, sat out a game, then limped back and was overmatched by David 
Robinson. Said teammate Derek Harper: "I'm not a doctor . . . but a lot of 
times you can rush things like that. You think you're ready and you're really 
not." 
</P>
<P>
 The Derrick Coleman boor-of-the-week award goes to Denver's Dikembe Mutombo, 
who celebrated a two-point victory over the Bulls by moaning, "I'm sick of all 
the (stuff) going on with this team. I'm frustrated. I'm not happy. I took one 
. . . shot. I am not getting any touches of the ball on offense. I'm afraid my 
role is becoming like Manute Bol. All I do is block shots. I'm sick of this 
(stuff)." . . . Miami, overstocked at small forward after its weird trades, 
tried Billy Owens at point guard. Also, the Heat has noticed that Owens is a 
bad free-throw shooter. Coach Kevin Loughery calls it "something a player has 
to stand up to and overcome. We expect him to make his foul shots down the 
stretch." Owens' reply, believe it or not: "At Golden State, I didn't go to the 
line much." 
</P>
<P>
 Madonna alert: Denver's Brian Williams shaved his head, got a ring in his nose 
and dyed his goatee blond. Now if he could only take 1,200 rebounds.

GIRLS' STATE VOLLEYBALL PLAYOFFS ; HARVARD-WESTLAKE VICTIMIZED BY INCONSISTENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Harvard-Westlake girls' volleyball team can take solace in having advanced 
deeper into the state playoffs than any local team. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakersfield Centennial High ended Westlake's run by rallying for a 3-15, 
15-11, 15-7, 15-7 victory in a quarterfinal match on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tendency for us is to be inconsistent," said Westlake's Amanda Selby, who 
had 15 kills. "It's kind of ironic; that's what haunted us all season." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wolverines, who finished 13-6, won the first game and appeared poised to 
gain an easy victory. 
</P>
<P>
 But Centennial, a school that is only two years old, is not your average 
opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 Centennial (29-6), seeded second in Division III, starts five sophomores and a 
junior. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, as a junior varsity team, it advanced to the Division IV state 
final and lost to Calvary Chapel of Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're definitely a strong team, and they'll be good the next couple of 
years," Selby said. 
</P>
<P>
 After winning the first game, the Wolverines struggled to regain their form. 
</P>
<P>
 Centennial jumped out to a 12-4 lead in the third game, and was not 
threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think our girls were afraid at the beginning," Centennial coach Brooke 
Roberts said. "We needed to find out why and take care of it, which we 
obviously did." 
</P>
<P>
 Lesley Coben and Lindsey McNeil each had eight kills for Westlake. 
</P>
<P>
 Janae Henry had 18 kills for Centennial. Sarah Slayton had 45 assists.

LEAP OF FAITH; FAITH BAPTIST ROUTS BRENTWOOD, 60-26, TO WIN EIGHT-MAN TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Faith Baptist High football coach Greg Weiss said his team's only chance to 
beat Brentwood was to adjust to the Eagles' defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Brentwood's blitzing and trapping schemes bottled up Faith Baptist in an 
earlier meeting won by Brentwood.  
</P>
<P>
 But on Saturday afternoon, it was Faith Baptist that pulled the biggest stunt, 
defeating Brentwood, 60-26, to claim the Southern Section Eight-Man Large 
Schools Division championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Faith Baptist ended Brentwood's 34-game winning streak and handed the Eagles a 
home loss for the first time since a 1990 playoff loss to Hesperia Christian. 
"In the first game, I got an F because I wasn't prepared," Weiss said. "This 
time, my staff and I got an A." 
</P>
<P>
 Faith Baptist also avenged last year's 35-34 loss to Brentwood in the 
championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Judd Granzow paced the Contenders, rushing for 127 yards in 16 
carries and scoring on runs of 30, eight and two yards. Granzow completed three 
of six passes for 96 yards, including two for touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Escalante had a 16-yard touchdown reception in the first quarter. Colby 
Carpenter scored on a 43-yard screen pass early in the second quarter to make 
the score 30-13. Escalante closed out the scoring with a 10-yard run in the 
fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad to be leaving the same way I started," Granzow said. "My first year 
here (1990), I quarterbacked a championship team, and now I get to close out 
the season and leave as (a champion), too." 
</P>
<P>
 Faith Baptist led, 40-13, at halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second half, the Contenders established a ground game to eat up the 
clock. Running back Rani Zahr had 129 yards in 15 carries and scored on a 
30-yard run. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Weiss: "This is a fitting way for my seniors to end their careers at 
Faith. They went from third place to first place in a span of three years." 
</P>
<P>
 Faith Baptist outscored opponents, 164-33, in its three playoff victories.

 UCLA will play Southern Methodist at SMU and Cal State Fullerton will play San 
Francisco at Fullerton today in the second round of the NCAA men's soccer 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA (16-4), ranked seventh, is led by Ante Razov, who has 13 goals and five 
assists for 31 points.Razov scored the winning goal with 4:24 to play in

THOUSAND OAKS BOYS COMPLETE A SUCCESSFUL RUN AT STATE TITLE; CROSS-COUNTRY: 
FISCHER PACES LANCERS TO SECOND CONSECUTIVE DIVISION I CHAMPIONSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Fischer of Thousand Oaks High makes it sound so simple. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to run well in the State cross-country championships, you must put 
a high priority on the race and forget about what you have accomplished -- or 
failed to accomplish -- in previous meets. 
</P>
<P>
 That thinking helped the Lancer senior finish third in the Division I race of 
the State championships at Woodward Park on Saturday and lead Thousand Oaks to 
its second consecutive team title. 
</P>
<P>
 Paced by the 3-6-9 finish of Fischer, Keith O'Doherty and Kevin Marsden, the 
Lancers posted a runaway 38-106 victory over Chula Vista. San Jose Bellarmine 
finished third with 110 points, followed by Peninsula (122), Hart (124) and 
Camarillo (139). 
</P>
<P>
 Peninsula upset Thousand Oaks, 82-91, in the girls' race to prevent the 
Lancers from becoming the first program to win both Division I titles in the 
same year. 
</P>
<P>
 In other races, Antonio Arce of Palmdale and Amy Skieresz of Agoura won the 
boys' and girls' Division II races while Nordhoff won its second consecutive 
Division III boys' title. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer had missed the first two meets of the season because of a hip injury, 
but after finishing fourth in last week's Southern Section championships, he 
figured he was ready for a big race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm for sure 100% back," he said earlier in the week. "I want to go out with 
the leaders Saturday and see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Sticking to his word, Fischer was among the lead pack that came through the 
mile in 4 minutes 49 seconds. By two miles (9:52), the pack had dwindled to 
Eleazar Hernandez of Camarillo, Adalberto Sanchez of Capistrano Valley, 
Fischer, Jeff McLarty of Ayala and Jason Balkman of San Jose Lynbrook. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez and Sanchez were pre-race favorites based on their 1-2 finish in the 
Southern Section championships, but it was the unheralded Balkman who broke 
open the race with 800 meters remaining and timed 15:15 over the 5,000-meter 
course. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez finished second in 15:20, followed by Fischer (15:29), McLarty 
(15:29) and Sanchez (15:35). 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors O'Doherty and Marsden timed 15:41 and 15:45, respectively, with 
juniors Josh Carolan (20th in 16:05) and Todd Disney (23rd in 16:09) rounding 
out Thousand Oaks' scoring runners. 
</P>
<P>
 The cumulative time of the Lancers' top five runners, 79:09, was well off 
their course record of 77:59 set last year. Temperatures in the low 40s and a 
muddy course from Friday's rains hindered times. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancer girls, who defeated Peninsula, 54-79, in the section championships, 
came up short in the rematch. 
</P>
<P>
 Juniors Kim Mortensen and Tara Marsden -- Kevin's sister -- placed fourth 
(18:29) and 13th (19:10) for Thousand Oaks, but Peninsula's superior depth gave 
Panther Coach Joe Kelley his fourth state title. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley guided Palos Verdes to State Division I titles from 1987-89 before the 
school combined with Rolling Hills and Miraleste in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Nordhoff entered the Division III boys' race as a decided underdog for the 
second year in a row, but the Rangers totaled 69 points to turn back El Modena 
(101) and favored Livermore (117). 
</P>
<P>
 Livermore's Micheil Jones (15:25) and Steve Immel (15:33) placed first and 
third, but seniors Javier Ramirez (second in 15:32) and Will Bernaldo (sixth in 
15:50), and junior Omar Vega (13th in 16:05) paced Nordhoff to its third state 
championship in the past four years. The Rangers won the Division IV title in 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't do anything magical," Coach Ken Reeves said when asked about the 
Rangers' success. "We've just got kids who are willing to work hard and believe 
in a system that is designed to have them run their best at this meet." 
</P>
<P>
 Arce and Skieresz each won individual Division II titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Arce, the runner-up in the 3,200 meters in the state track and field 
championships in June, shared the lead with Peter Gilmore of Palisades, John 
Greene of Agoura and Michael Stember of Carmichael Jesuit for the first mile 
(4:49) before making a break midway through the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a little surprised that they didn't go with me at (the mile-and-a-half 
point)," said Arce, who finished in 15:25. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took a glance at them and they looked pretty strong, but I guess they must 
not have been feeling that well." 
</P>
<P>
 Skieresz, who won the Division I title last year, also pulled away from her 
pursuers in the final mile, but her time of 18:12 was 23 seconds slower than a 
year ago and only the fifth-fastest of the meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Rosa sophomore Julia Stamps set a course record of 17:06 in winning the 
Division I title. Courtney Pugmire of Esperanza placed second behind Stamp in 
18:08, while Nordhoff's Elaine Canchola had the fastest time among local 
performers, running 18:07 to place second behind fellow freshman Heather 
Garritson (18:01) of Buena Park in the Division III race.

MOORPARK ADVANCES TO STATE TOURNAMENT; WOMEN'S SOCCER: FISHER MAKES KEY SAVE AS 
RAIDERS DEFEAT CYPRESS, 3-2, ON PENALTY KICKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Amy Fisher made several key saves Saturday but none bigger than the final one 
during penalty kicks that sent Moorpark College to the State women's soccer 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark, the fourth-seeded team in Southern California, and top-seeded 
Cypress were tied, 1-1, after failing to break the deadlock in 90 minutes of 
regulation and 30 minutes of overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark won, 3-2, when Fisher dived far to the right to knock away a penalty 
shot by Cypress' Christy Rowe. Fisher had 13 saves in regulation and four in 
overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Ranuschio, Summer Salvatera and Maureen O'Hare scored on penalty 
kicks for Moorpark (10-3-4). The state tournament is Dec. 3-4 in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Tyler and Tracy Van Herk scored for Cypress, which finished 16-1-2. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second consecutive postseason loss on penalty kicks for Cypress, 
which lost in the same manner to DeAnza in the state title game last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all had our Lucky Charms for breakfast today," Moorpark Coach Ken Dale 
said. "It's a tough way for either team to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress dominated the first half, but Fisher had seven saves and the teams 
were tied, 0-0. Cypress struggled partly because starting forwards Traci Osman 
(ankle) and Lori Van Herk (knee) were out because of injuries. Osman had nine 
goals this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress broke the scoreless tie when Pam Prine scored her 10th goal off an 
assist by Rowe in the 81st minute. Moorpark rallied about two minutes later 
when Christy McGowan put a rebound past Cypress goalkeeper April O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark's previous best chance to score came when O'Brien fell going for 
loose ball, but Rowe dashed in and kicked it away just before it crossed the 
goal line.

THE HIGH SCHOOLS / KENNEDY COSGROVE: TAFT'S 'HARDCORE FOUR' FINISH CAREERS WITH 
A HEARTBREAKING LOSS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The week that was in high school football . . . broken dreams, broken records 
and an (almost) broken hand. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, the Taft High football team went 1-8. Troy Starr arrived as 
coach, and four sophomores in particular suited up: Jerry Brown, DaShon Polk, 
Dion Gaston and Dayon Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
 The quartet quickly became close friends and helped turn the Toreadors around, 
reaching the City Section 3-A final in their first season. Notice was served: 
Taft was a power. And the City 4-A championship would eventually be theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 As juniors, they came up short, losing to Dorsey in the second round of last 
season's playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 This season would be the last chance for "The Hardcore Four," as they called 
themselves. Brown, Gaston and Polk were repeat All-City players. Shaw was an 
excellent defensive back and a rapidly improving quarterback, and they were the 
four team captains this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Before games, they lined up their four gold helmets on the 50-yard sideline 
pointing toward the middle of the field, and all four knelt apart from the 
team, holding hands and joining in prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing the opener by one point, Taft won 10 consecutive games. After the 
Toreadors clinched the Northwest Valley Conference crown, the foursome took a 
group photo with Starr, which he kept. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were the backbone of the team for the past three years," Starr said. 
"They're just really good kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Taft again reached the second round of the City playoffs Wednesday against 
Dorsey. Things would be different this year. It had to be. The Hardcore Four 
wanted more. 
</P>
<P>
 But after taking a 13-point lead late in the fourth quarter, the Toreadors 
surrendered three touchdowns in the final four minutes, including an 
interception of a Shaw pass that was returned 65 yards for a score as time 
expired. Taft lost, 26-20. 
</P>
<P>
 Tears flowed freely on the field and in the locker room, Gaston said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't believe it," he said. "I still don't believe it. I know my 
Thanksgiving was spoiled." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a painful way to end those four noteworthy careers. But don't change 
their name to the Heartbreak Four. Their friendship and accomplishments should 
last long after the pain subsides.

 The real Akil: Meet the newest Montclair Prep record-setting rusher -- Akil 
Anderson. The junior gained 424 yards in 41 carries Saturday in the Mounties' 
42-point drubbing of Big Bear. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching from the stands were the old guard: Wilbur Smith, who set the 
previous school record of 386 yards last season and is now at Illinois; Eliel 
Swinton, who held the Montclair record before Smith and now plays defensive 
back for Stanford; and Michael Jones, a former Mountie running back who played 
at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they all trail Anderson, who was left in the game with the score 50-8 
after coaches found out he had 394 yards. They were under impression that the 
state record was 421 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Turns out they were a bit off. The California high school record is 507 yards 
by David Dotson of Moreno Valley Valley View, but Anderson's binge tied for 
ninth best in state history. It also tied the best effort in area history with 
Darren Rogers of Agoura, who rushed for 424 in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 "They told me at halftime I had 250," Anderson said. "But I wasn't concerned 
about records. I was concerned about getting a win and going to the 
semifinals." 
</P>

 Lending a hand: Notre Dame linebacker David Dupetit thought he might have 
broken his right hand after being thrown to the turf in the second quarter of a 
Division III quarterfinal Friday against Royal. 
</P>
<P>
 But after sitting out the rest of the quarter, he had the hand tightly taped 
at halftime and convinced coaches to let him play in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 He preserved the Knights' 21-14 victory by sacking Royal quarterback Wes 
Lagatta and forcing a fumble in the waning moments. 
</P>
<P>
 Dupetit (pronounced DOO-puh-dee) then went to the hospital, where X-rays of 
his hand were negative. It proved to be just a painful sprain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our defense is all hustle and hard work," Dupetit said. "If you put in 100%, 
no matter what, you're going to play good defense. We don't have any stars, we 
all just work hard." 
</P>
<P>
 None work harder than the 5-foot-10, 200 pound senior. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Notre Dame Coach Kevin Rooney: "He's led our team in tackles in each of 
the three seasons he's been on the varsity level. He's our most valuable player 
and he just does everything -- making tackles, sacking quarterbacks, forcing 
fumbles. He's just a tremendous player."

 The ever-popular coin flip: Southern Section semifinal playoff sites were 
determined Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 In Division II -- where three of the remaining four teams are from the area -- 
Peninsula will play at Antelope Valley on Friday and top-seeded Hart will play 
at Quartz Hill on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Division III, Notre Dame will play at Serra on Friday. In Division IX, 
Harvard-Westlake plays host to Atascadero on Friday at a site to be determined 
and Nordhoff is at home against Santa Ynez on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Division X, Montclair Prep plays Kilpatrick, which won the coin flip but is 
still searching for a site. The Mustangs have no home field.

 After leading by double digits for a good portion of the game, the Moorpark 
College men's basketball team had to hang on for a 91-88 victory over Antelope 
Valley in the semifinals of the Ventura tournament Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark (4-1) will face Ventura in the championship game tonight at 7.

seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark point guard Jaime Jaquez scored the final two points of the game on 
free throws with 13 seconds remaining. Jaquez finished with a team-high 27

<P>
 Marauder forward Orville Turner missed a three-point attempt at the buzzer. 
Turner led all scorers with 32 points and made seven three-point shots. He also

<P>
 Moorpark led Kings River by 15 points in the first half of its first-round 
game Friday but escaped with a 57-50 victory.

GLENDALE ELIMINATED BY RANCHO SANTIAGO; MEN'S SOCCER: VAQUEROS LOSE PLAYOFF 
MATCH, 1-0, IN OVERTIME. THEY FINISH 15-1-5. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Rancho Santiago's Francisco Islas was kept silent during most of Saturday's 
Southern California men's soccer playoff match against Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 But Islas didn't let up. 
</P>
<P>
 His persistence paid off with the game-winning goal in the 117th minute, 
sending the host Dons to a 1-0 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Islas, who scored nearly half of Rancho Santiago's goals this season, was 
limited to three shots during regulation and was not a factor during most of 
the overtime. But with three minutes left in the extra period, he took a 
rebound from Andrew Otelie on the right side of the goal and banked in the 
game-winner off the left post. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal spoiled an outstanding performance by Glendale goalkeeper Erick 
Alvarado, who made 17 saves. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale (15-15) had only six shots and Rancho Santiago goalkeeper Scott 
Zinser didn't record a save. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were all over them, and we finally executed," Rancho Santiago Coach J.P. 
Frutos said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons (17-2-3) dominated the first half, outshooting Glendale, 11-3. Rancho 
Santiago's best scoring opportunity came when Arthur Salce's header hit the 
crossbar at the 25-minute mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale's best scoring opportunity came midway through overtime, but 
Giancarlo Madariaga's shot on a breakaway went wide left. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Rancho Santiago) deserved to win," Glendale Coach Joe Agoston said. "Our 
game never really developed. We were sloppy in the first half, and settled down 
in the second. I don't think we were mentally ready to win at this level."

HOLLYWOOD PARK; NATIVE REGENT COMES LONG WAY FOR VICTORY IN GENEROUS STAKES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Because grass stakes for 2-year-olds are a rare commodity, trainer David Bell 
circled the $250,000 Generous Stakes at Hollywood Park as a possible 
destination for Native Regent a couple of months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 All he had to do in the interim was to see if the Vice Regent colt was worthy 
of making the long trip from Woodbine in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Two wins and two seconds in four previous turf races showed Bell that Native 
Regent was deserving of the chance, and owner John Franks' home-bred proved 
successful in his initial venture outside Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 With regular jockey David Penna aboard, Native Regent tracked the pace set by 
Fandarel Dancer, then withstood a bid by 11-1 longshot Dangerous Scenario and 
rider Randy Romero to win by a length in 1:37 for the mile. 
</P>
<P>
 "This horse has been doing real well here, but shipping out west can be tough 
on a horse, so you never know," said Bell, who sent Native Regent here three 
weeks ago. "The question was, would he handle this turf course? The Woodbine 
turf course is a little different than this. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had our eye on this race for a few months, but we wanted to see if he 
was good enough first. We'll go to Florida with him, maybe give him some time 
off and maybe run at Gulfstream later, but we plan to keep him on the grass in 
the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Riding for the first time since retiring July 4, then announcing he was 
returning a couple of weeks ago, Romero finished a half-length in front of 2-1 
favorite Claudius on Dangerous Scenario, who was making his first start on 
grass a month after breaking his maiden. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was his first time going a route and he got tired," said Romero. "Well, 
I got tired too. It's been five months now since I've ridden a race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I had the winner at the top of the lane, but he re-broke and went 
ahead and drew off while my horse got a little tired." 
</P>
<P>
 Claudius, who had some traffic trouble entering the stretch under Kent 
Desormeaux, was nearly two lengths in front of Our Gatsby. Perfect did a poor 
imitation of his superstar sister Flawlessly in his first try on grass, 
finishing sixth. Norfolk Stakes winner Supremo finished last as the 3-1 second 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Desormeaux and trainer Bill Mott, in absentia, had better luck in the $200,000 
Miesque Stakes later in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Favored Bail Out Becky made it three consecutive victories on the turf with a 
1 1/4-length decision over 3-1 second choice Miss Union Avenue in 1:37 1/5 for 
the mile. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our instructions to Kent?" said Cecil Seaman, the racing manager for Bail Out 
Becky's owner Kenneth Ramsey, who saddled the filly in Mott's absence. The 
trainer was in Japan with Paradise Creek for the Japan Cup. "Just win. I told 
him to lay off the pace and he rode a perfect race. She ran a tremendous race 
and she's always had a good kick." 
</P>
<P>
 Bail Out Becky paid $6.40 and earned $110,000 for Ramsey. 
</P>
<P>
 Makin Whoopee, who was extremely fractious before the start, finished third, a 
half-length behind Miss Union Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Aube Indienne, who will try to give trainer Charlie Whittingham his fourth 
consecutive Matriarch victory and eighth overall, is the 5-2 favorite in the 
$400,000 Grade I race today. 
</P>
<P>
 Unbeaten in two starts since joining Whittingham's barn, Aube Indienne won the 
Las Palmas and Yellow Ribbon at Santa Anita and she won her only other start 
over the Hollywood Park turf course when trained by Rodney Rash. 
</P>
<P>
 Desormeaux has the mount on the 4-year-old filly, who drew the rail in the 
field of nine fillies and mares. 
</P>
<P>
 Exchange, who could go over $1 million in career earnings today, is the 3-1 
second choice. Although the 6-year-old Explodent mare hasn't run on the grass 
for about 18 months, she has seven victories in 11 starts on the surface. 
Laffit Pincay will ride. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the field includes Corrazona, disappointing in her last three 
races after winning her first three starts in this country; the Bobby 
Frankel-trained entry of Wandesta and Skimble, Zoonaqua, Fondly Remembered, a 
troubled second in the Yellow Ribbon; Las Meninas and Alywow, second to 
Raintrap in the Rothmans International. 
</P>
<P>
 In the other stakes on the card, Romarin, who was very impressive in his 
American debut, is the 8-5 favorite in the inaugural $150,000 Hollywood Mile on 
the grass. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3-1 second choice is Slew Of Damascus, who hasn't run since finishing 
fourth in the Pacific Classic at Del Mar in August. The other four entrants are 
Inner City, Firm Pledge, Rapan Boy and Ventiquattrofogli. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Wayne Lukas strengthened his hold on the money lead in the national 
standings, winning three 2-year-old stakes races in less than an hour. He won 
the Demoiselle and Remsen at Aqueduct with Minister Wife and Thunder Gulch, 
respectively, then took the Golden Rod Stakes at Churchill Downs with favored 
Lilly Capote. . . . Jambalaya Jazz won the $150,000 Kentucky Jockey Club at 
Churchill Downs, beating You're The One by a length in 1:46 2/5 for the 1 1/16 
miles. Even-money favorite Peaks And Valleys was third and California shipper 
A.J. Jett, who is trained by Frank Olivares, was fifth in the field of seven. . 
. . Wekiva Springs, who will make his next start in the Vernon O. Underwood 
Breeders' Cup on Saturday, worked six furlongs in 1:12 1/5 at Santa Anita.

FORMER THOUSAND OAKS COACH HOWELL DEAD AT 63 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DESMOND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joe Howell, former Thousand Oaks High football coach, died Friday morning at 
UCLA Medical Center, a family spokesman said. He was 63. 
</P>
<P>
 Rio Mesa Coach George Contreras, speaking on behalf of the family, said that 
Howell had recently suffered from hepatitis caused by a blood transfusion. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy is scheduled to determine the cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
 Howell coached at Thousand Oaks from 1968-76 and won Marmonte League 
championships in '72, '73, '74 and '76 while posting a 52-35-1 record. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe was integrity," said current Thousand Oaks Coach Bob Richards, who served 
as an assistant under Howell. "I just wish that more coaches had his 
perspective of what high school football should be. If they did, we'd have a 
much-healthier high school situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Several who coached or played under Howell went on to become coaches, 
including Richards, Contreras and Moorpark College assistant Dave Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
 Howell, who graduated from Central State University in Edmund, Okla., in 1954, 
coached seven years in the Midwest before moving to Ventura County in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 He served as an assistant coach at Oxnard High for six seasons before being 
named coach at Thousand Oaks, where he worked to improve not only his own 
program but football throughout the county. He co-founded the Ventura County 
Football Coaches Assn. in 1973, initiated the Ventura County All-Star Game and 
served on the board of directors of the Southern California Interscholastic 
Football Coaches Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1970, Thousand Oaks was among the first in the county to install lights to 
boost attendance, Contreras said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was an extremely important figure in Ventura County football," Contreras 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Howell continued to teach at Thousand Oaks until his retirement in 1985. Since 
then, he had worked as a cabinetmaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Services will be held Tuesday at 11 a.m. at the Pierce Brothers Mortuary in 
Thousand Oaks. Howell is survived by his wife Nadine, son Jody and daughter 
Julie.

<P>
 Dionne played with her back to the basket last season on offense and averaged 
6.7 points. This year, she will face the basket to take advantage of her 
outside shooting ability. Smith says Noonan, who averaged 11 points last season 
and was a second-team all-league selection, will be more aggressive and 
definitely score more. Chambers will also start. Smith said she has good 
offensive skills and will provide rebounding help. But inexperience in the 
backcourt might hurt the Eagles--sophomore Stone and freshman Morley will share 
guard duties. Peyrebrune is the team's best outside shooter. "The inside game 
will be our strength," Smith said, "if we can get the ball there." Smith said 
after a year playing in her system, the Eagles' execution should have improved. 
Despite their youth, Smith said the Eagles have a good shot at the league's 
third playoff spot. SCHEDULE

 Murphy said Janell Jewett, the team's top returning scorer, has improved her 
offensive skills and gained confidence. Holmes also might blossom into an 
offensive threat. Barbee will likely make the biggest impact out of the 
newcomers. Murphy expects her to take some of the scoring and rebounding burden 
off Jewett. Sendzik will start at point guard, but Wennekamp will get plenty of 
playing time there. The eight newcomers were part of an 18-7 junior varsity 
team last season. Murphy said she expects a big improvement from last season, 
because she took the job in September, and it took the team awhile to adjust to 
her system. Murphy said she figures the Chargers to battle Corona del Mar, 
Santa Margarita and Irvine for third place. SCHEDULE

 Jakosky said she knows what to expect out of her senior starters, given that 
Clayton and Schutz were starters the previous two seasons. "We expect our 
seniors to be solid--they are pretty battle-tested by now," Jakosky said. 
Pulido is "a physical player who is not afraid to bang." But she said if the 
Sailors are to match last season's success--they advanced to the State Division 
III-A semifinals before losing to Brea-Olinda--the five newcomers must make 
significant contributions. "The key to our season will be the maturation of the 
sophomores and the freshman," Jakosky said. "They are taking the place of two 
key senior leaders--Gina Heads and Genevieve Evarts." Jakosky expects the 
Sailors to finish second, behind Woodbridge, but she is focusing beyond league 
play. "We're expecting to get deep into (the playoffs)," she said. "We'd be 
disappointed if we didn't." SCHEDULE

 Flint, who hasn't had a team qualify for the playoffs in five years at Corona 
del Mar, says this team has a good shot at third place and a playoff spot. 
"Athletically, this is my best team top to bottom," he said. "We're very, very 
fast." Warmington set a school record with 45 three-pointers last season, and 
averaged 9.6 points. Flint said he expects Macfarland, who averaged 3.4 points 
last season, to at least double her output. "She's really come around this 
year," he said. "(Last year) she didn't take advantage of her height. She never 
realized that if she wants to, she can dominate." Gardner has the best moves in 
the low post. Flint said Casey is now "physically mature" and should also score 
more. Flint said he expects fierce competition for the No. 3 playoff spot. "It 
would be wonderful to get into (the playoffs)," he said. "That No. 3 spot is 
going to be tough, with teams like El Toro and Santa Margarita coming on."

 The strength of Brazell's team will be her backcourt, where Stevens averaged 
15 points last year. But Brazell said Newe will take a lot of scoring pressure 
off Stevens. "She's going to surprise a lot of people this year," Brazell said. 
"She's improved so much. We used to be known as a team that couldn't get the 
ball to half-court if we were pressed. She forced teams to stop pressing us." 
After that, roles are unclear. "Our other three starters depend on who we are 
playing," Brazell said. "I don't think we'll ever have a solid starting five." 
Brazell said Bodholdt is the second-strongest player in the league, behind 
Angela Burgess, and Kettner is a good shooter. Brazell said she was excited 
about her team's improvement, but acknowledged that it might not be enough to 
earn a playoff spot. "I definitely expect an improvement, but the league's 
tougher," she said. "Our goal is to make the playoffs, and this is the first 
year we can realistically say that." SCHEDULE

FULLERTON SOCCER TEAM MEETS USF IN PLAYOFFS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton will try to keep its hopes alive in the NCAA soccer 
playoffs today when the Titans play San Francisco, a team with a rich soccer 
tradition, at 1 p.m. in a second-round match in Titan Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans (13-6-2) will be making their second consecutive appearance at home 
in the playoffs.Fullerton won its NCAA opener last weekend, 3-1 in overtime, 
against San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's game could be Fullerton's final home appearance of the season, win or 
lose. The winner of the Fullerton-San Francisco game will face the winner of 
the game between top-ranked Indiana (20-2) and Creighton (15-4-1) next weekend 
at a site to be determined Monday by the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
 "San Francisco is a tough, well-disciplined team, so we'll have to play well 
to win," Titan Coach Al Mistri said. "They have been prominent in college 
soccer for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dons (10-6-3) are coached by Stephen Negoesco, whose teams have reached 
the NCAA playoffs 25 times his 33 years as coach. San Francisco has won four 
NCAA titles in the sport, the last in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco has eight starters back from the team Fullerton eliminated, 1-0, 
in the third round of the playoffs last year. Striker Staale Soebye and 
goalkeeper Scott Thompson are key players. Soebye has 15 goals in 18 games and 
Thompson has allowed 19 goals in 17 games and has 69 saves. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans' chief concern today will be depth. Midfielder Adrian Cortes, who 
was injured late in Saturday's game, is out for the rest of the season because 
of torn ligaments in an ankle. The Titans also lost standout defender Demian 
Brown at midseason because of an injury. LON EUBANKS

<P>
 ARLINGTON AVENUE: Approved the transfer of $1.2 million in special project 
funds for the 10th Council District to reconstruct Arlington Avenue from the 
Santa Monica Freeway south to Jefferson Boulevard. The funds had been earmarked 
for resurfacing a bumpy stretch of Normandie Avenue between Olympic and Pico 
boulevards. But because that project won't start for at least a year, the money 
was transferred to the Arlington project, on which work is to begin by the end 
of January. The pavement on Arlington, said by street maintenance officials to 
be among the worst in the city, will be taken out, the base rebuilt and new 
pavement added. In addition, the notorious "double dip" section of Arlington 
near 26th Place, two steep elevation changes within 50 feet of each other, is 
to be smoothed out. 
</P>
<P>
 * HARVARD HEIGHTS: Authorized the city engineer to allow the Harvard Heights 
Neighborhood Assn. to install a stone monument at the corner of Westmoreland 
and Washington boulevards to mark the entrance to the Harvard Heights 
neighborhood. The seven-foot-high, pyramid-shaped stone had been used as a 
stand for a street light, but for years has been stored by the Bureau of Street 
Lighting. It will be installed, without the light, with money collected by the 
neighborhood association. 
</P>
<P>
 * WILLING WORKERS: Authorized the Community Development Department to issue a 
$200,000 grant to Willing Workers Inc. for the rehabilitation of its facility 
at 4813 W. Washington Blvd. Founded in 1969, the nonprofit group provides 
counseling and job training services to 150 mentally disabled adults. The 
building renovation includes the replacement of the roof, repair of metal eaves 
and modification of bathroom facilities to accommodate disabled people. 
</P>
<P>
 * REWARDS ISSUED: Approved the payment of $15,000 to one witness and $10,000 
to a second whose testimonies were vital to the first-degree murder convictions 
of two men who stabbed Kalpesh Vardhan to death on Aug. 19, 1992, at 808 S. 
Olive St. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 How South-Central and Eastside City Council representatives voted on selected 
issues.  
</P>
<P>
 * BUILDING REPAIR: Approved a motion that allows repair work at a city-owned 
building leased by the YMCA at 404 S. Bixel to be done by private contractors 
rather than by the city. The building will house the Youth Fair Chance 
Demonstration Project, a $3-million federal job-training project for adults 
ages 18 to 30. The reason for the motion was that the city needs to expedite 
the project to be eligible for further funding. Private contractors, according 
to those backing the motion, would do the work more quickly and economically. 
Passed 12-0. Voting yes: Jackie Goldberg, Mike Hernandez, Nate Holden, Rudy 
Svorinich Jr. Absent: Richard Alatorre, Rita Walters. MICHAEL KRIKORIAN

GET READY FOR A REAL TASTE OF HANUKKAH SPIRIT; RELIGION: JEWS WILL CELEBRATE 
THE EIGHT-DAY FESTIVAL OF LIGHTS WITH MUSIC, PAGEANTRY -- AND TRADITIONAL 
FOODS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DI RADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In some ways, it makes sense that Hanukkah comes on the heels of Thanksgiving 
this year. Why not go right from one food-filled holiday of family celebration 
and togetherness to another? 
</P>
<P>
 "Religion should begin in the kitchen," said a chuckling Carol Cooperman, a 
member of Temple Beth David in Westminster. To put her words into practice, she 
plans to take applesauce and traditional latkes , potato pancakes, to share 
with office co-workers at Golden West College. 
</P>
<P>
 For Cooperman and thousands of other Jews in Orange County, the eight-day 
Jewish Festival of Lights begins tonight. Observances will be conducted at 
synagogues, community centers and homes throughout the week. 
</P>
<P>
 For about 2,000 years, Jews have observed Hanukkah as a celebration of 
religious freedom. The holiday commemorates the 165 BC victory of the 
outnumbered Maccabees over the Syrians, who had captured and defiled the temple 
in Jerusalem with Greek deities. 
</P>
<P>
 A popular legend told to children involves the "miracle of the oil": The 
Maccabees needed to reclaim and cleanse the temple, but could find enough 
consecrated oil to keep their eternal light ignited only for one day. The flame 
miraculously burned for eight days, leading to the eight-day celebration.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When people think of Hanukkah, many think of the colorful traditions that 
children find special: the dreidel , or spinning toy top; the hanukkiah , or 
Hanukkah menorah; and the pancakes, fried jelly doughnut-like sufganiyot and 
other delicacies served on Jewish tables. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rabbi Arnold Rachlis of the University Synagogue in Irvine wants adults to 
keep a Hanukkah message in mind too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll talk about the historical story," Rachlis said, "and I'll ask people to 
think about mediating between being acculturated to mainstream American society 
and being Jewish." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, his synagogue won't forget kids. A Hanukkah play, choir performances 
and a family service will begin at 7:30 p.m. Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a three-ring Hanukkah service," Rachlis said. "The only thing we don't 
have is a magician." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Michael Mayersohn of Temple Beth David said Hanukkah is really a 
celebration in the home. "Most of it goes on in people's houses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayersohn's congregation will participate in a public menorah lighting, 
though, at the Long Beach Jewish Community Center on Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 "Historically it was a minor holiday, but it became more important in recent 
times," Mayersohn said, "especially because of the influence of American 
culture and Christmas. But Hanukkah should be an opportunity for Jews to 
celebrate the survival of Jewish identity . . . and the preservation of Jewish 
traditions." 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly enough, some who are Jewish have never experienced Hanukkah, said 
Charlene Edwards, director of special services at the Jewish Family Service in 
Orange.  
</P>
<P>
 That organization will host a Hanukkah party for refugees from the former 
Soviet Union who are observing their first holidays in the United States. Many 
were not allowed to practice their religion under Communist rule. Edwards said 
she sees about 100 new Russian refugees each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will tell the story of Hanukkah to the children in both English and 
Russian," Edwards said. They also will try to get 2- to 16-year-olds to take 
roles in a Hanukkah play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some will play Jews, some will play Syrians," Edwards said. "We take turns . 
. . you can be both." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The party on Sunday, the last day of Hanukkah, will feature children's gifts 
and a speaker who recently emigrated from Russia, where she was an outspoken 
activist for the survival of Jewish religion and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jewish Community Center in Costa Mesa has also scheduled cultural events, 
including a visit by an Israeli dance troupe, which will perform and light a 
menorah at 8 p.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Jews said the proximity of Thanksgiving and Hanukkah is unusual because 
Hanukkah, determined by the lunar calendar, doesn't usually come this early. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it snuck up on everybody," Mayersohn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooperman said the food aspect of the holidays helps everyone appreciate the 
richness of cultural and religious differences, whether Jew, Christian or 
other. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking food to share at work is a "casual, everyday kind of thing," said 
Cooperman, a statistical clerk. "I bring in potato pancakes, you bring in 
fruitcake. . . . Eating is the best way of getting our understanding across."

THE ART OF SHOPPING; CRAFTSMEN EXHIBIT HOLIDAY WARES AT LAGUNA FESTIVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY HSU, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 Instead of shoving her way through crowded malls for the usual Christmas gift 
items this year, Kelly Turnbull decided to get her grandparents something only 
she could give -- her face. 
</P>
<P>
 Turnbull, 11, sat motionless on a canvas chair Saturday at the Sawdust 
Festival's Fourth Annual Winter Fantasy as a crowd watched artist Ann Curtis 
lay wet plaster across the child's face. 
</P>
<P>
 For $20, the Laguna Beach girl had a facial imprint made by Curtis, one of 
more than 150 local and out-of-state artists selling handmade items and 
conducting demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 The winter version of the summer Sawdust Festival, held at a three-acre 
eucalyptus grove along Laguna Canyon Road, gives shoppers an outdoor Christmas 
shopping experience that spotlights the arts, organizers said. It also features 
numerous activities to keep children happy, including a wintry playground with 
real snow delivered fresh every morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not like any other festival or fair you've ever seen," said Theresa 
Marino, a spokeswoman for the festival, a nonprofit Laguna Beach artist's 
organization named for the sawdust that covers the ground. "Instead of going to 
the mall, you can support the artists. It's a nice alternative. People can just 
come here and enjoy themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the art exhibits, there were also many booths where participants 
could make something for free. 
</P>
<P>
 In front of a dozen onlookers, Jessie Bartels, a 20-year-old ceramics student 
at Saddleback Community College in Mission Viejo, helped KenthiaPhillips, 12, 
fashion a vase from a glob of clay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm probably going to buy some paints, paint it and give it to one of my 
friends as a gift," said Phillips of Fallbrook. 
</P>
<P>
 Holiday shopping was the goal for many festival-goers. But in keeping with a 
nationwide trend, many at the festival Saturday appeared to be browsing, not 
buying. Even those enraptured by the variety of art said they were looking for 
practical gifts at bargain prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeri Berger, 38, of Placentia has already spent hundreds of dollars on 
Christmas presents this year, but "almost everybody I know is spending more," 
she said, watching Turnbull wipe plaster off her face. "Things are looking up. 
More people have jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Berger said she came to the festival because she enjoys looking at "the 
unusual." 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, we're just thinking of artsy gifts, but I like the art to be useful," 
said Carl Nelson, 63, a civil engineer from Newport Beach, as his wife wandered 
toward a display of handmade 14K gold jewelry set with Australian opals. 
</P>
<P>
 Alice Peterson, an artist from Santa Cruz, didn't characterize her apple dolls 
as practical, but they did get a lot of response from passersby. The dolls, 
decked out in traditional Victorian dress, all had dried golden delicious 
apples as heads. 
</P>
<P>
 "I use my fingers to shape their faces. It's about a 10-day process," Peterson 
said. "Some of them get little white beads as teeth. I also spray them with 
clear plastic spray at the end." 
</P>
<P>
 Peterson said she hadn't sold many of the dolls priced from $66 to $75, but 
the $12 dried-apple ornaments were selling at a fast clip. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the slow sales on the dolls, Peterson said she does not intend to 
lower her prices. "It takes a lot of time to make and each one is unique," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sawdust Festival's fourth annual Winter Fantasy continues from 11 a.m. to 
7 p.m. today, and next weekend at 935 Laguna Canyon Road, Laguna Beach. 
Admission is $3. Children 12 and younger are admitted free when accompanied by 
an adult.

METHOD ACTING AS MOTIVATION; UCI LATINO DRAMA CLUB PUSHES ANTI-GANG MESSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When 22-year-old Jaime Cruz performs in the play he wrote to warn students 
about the hazards of gang life, he doesn't have to use much imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 He was beaten severely by four gang members during an initiation rite at age 
12. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a senior at UC Irvine, Cruz is a member of a different kind of group. 
Three years ago, he founded the Chicano-Latino Drama Club, an association of 
Latino UCI students who put the hard lessons of gang life into their 
performances. The 30-member group performs for schools and community 
organizations, trying to persuade young people to leave gang life behind and 
concentrate on education. 
</P>
<P>
 From age 12 to 16, Cruz was a gang member in South Central Los Angeles, where 
he says he committed "small crimes" and fell into drug abuse. He followed the 
example of his two older brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mother left us when I was 9, and my dad passed away when I was 13," Cruz 
said. "The only people I used to look up to were my older brothers, but they 
were mostly in jail." 
</P>
<P>
 A 24-year-old brother is currently in prison, he said, serving time for 
burglary. 
</P>
<P>
 At UCI, Cruz is working toward a teaching credential and plans to attend law 
school after teaching for a few years. He began the slow process of change at 
age 15 after seeing a play performed by ex-gang members. By the time he 
graduated from Fremont High School, he had a 3.8 grade-point average. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the drama club members have studied acting, but they are inspired by 
the potential of the play, "The Town I Live In," to change lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're trying to do is let kids see the entire life of a gang," said club 
member Arturo Cervantes, a 22-year-old civil engineering major at UCI. 
Cervantes was a gang member from age 11 to 13 in East Los Angeles. "When you're 
young and you're involved in gangs, you don't realize that eventually you're 
either going to get killed or paralyzed, or you're going to regret everything 
that you've done." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the club performed for students bused to the UCI campus from Santa 
Ana High School. The play tells the story of three brothers who each become the 
leader of a gang. The leadership passes down each time an older brother is 
killed by a rival gang member.  
</P>
<P>
 The middle brother, played by Cruz, tries to leave the gang, but his wife and 
child are killed in retaliation. At the end of the play, he is killed while 
trying to save his younger brother from rival gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 Club member Estela Gonzalez, a 22-year-old sociology major, grew up in Compton 
surrounded by the kind of gang member she portrays on stage. Though not in a 
gang herself, she said many of her friends at Compton High School were gang 
members and some of them were killed. But even the death of friends does little 
to convince young people to quit gangs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have friends who are still in gangs and I try to talk to them to make a 
change, but for some it's hard," Gonzalez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the drama club try to win the trust of the students who attend 
their performances, talking with them after the play and giving out their phone 
numbers. They know that leaving a gang is not easy, especially for those who 
have little or no home life. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Cruz was 12 years old, his gang was his family. He had no parents and 
lived with an older sister. By the time he was 14, Cruz said, he was using an 
unloaded gun to rob people to get money for food, clothing and bus fare. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was mostly old ladies," he said. "Whenever they didn't want to give me 
their purse or their wallet, I used to scream at them and say, 'I'll kill you!' 
and that would scare them and they would just give it to me. For some reason, I 
never got caught." 
</P>
<P>
 But Cruz says he now wants to help fight against the kind of life he left 
behind. Someday, he hopes to found a community center for youths to provide 
alternatives to gangs. "Everything that I took away from society, I'm trying to 
give back," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's real hard to reach a lot of the kids, because the main reason why so 
many of us join gangs when we are young is because we're missing a dad or we're 
missing a mom. You feel the lack of love. So what the homeboys do, they make 
you realize they're going to be your second family. I just want the kids to 
know that there is the possibility that they can change."

HATE CRIME CASE HINGES ON GROUP RESPONSIBILITY; COURTS: CIVIL TRIAL TARGETS 10 
YOUTHS PRESENT AT LAGUNA BEACH BEATING IN 1993. EXPANDED LAWS HAVE GIVEN 
VICTIMS A BETTER CHANCE TO SEEK COMPENSATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Loc Minh Truong may never remember what happened the night he was beaten so 
severely that he nearly died on a rocky Laguna Beach shoreline, the victim of a 
hate crime that sparked widespread outcry. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 57-year-old man will always bear the physical injuries from that 
January, 1993, attack that shattered his teeth, tore his left eye from the 
socket and left the back of his head impaled on a rock. 
</P>
<P>
 Two young men already have been convicted of attacking Truong because they 
thought he was gay, but the case will move back to court this week as Truong 
seeks money to help pay medical bills and other expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Truong is suing the two convicted assailants, along with eight other 
teen-agers who were at the scene of the attack but never charged with a crime. 
Those teens said they did not know the attack was going to occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Six teens have already settled out of court for more than $400,000, according 
to Truong's attorney, Russell Kerr. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial, which is scheduled to begin Monday in Orange County Superior Court 
in Santa Ana, will delve into issues of group responsibility, and just who can 
be held liable for a crime. Expanded civil rights laws have given Truong and 
other hate crime victims better legal footing for seeking compensation in civil 
court, Kerr said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These cases are examples of peer pressure escalating into mob violence," Kerr 
said. "In such situations, you can't stand by and watch an attack with impunity 
when, by your actions and your presence, you have incited and encouraged the 
attack." 
</P>
<P>
 Truong, an electronics plant worker who was unemployed at the time of the 
attack, spent more than a month in the hospital and has since had to move in 
with family for help with his care. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerr said his client has permanent brain damage that causes memory problems. 
Truong can no longer drive a car, shop by himself or hold a job, he said. He is 
seeking about $150,000 for medical bills as well as general and punitive 
damages of $2.5 million, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer said he hopes the case might prevent other hate crimes by raising 
the possibility of stiff civil penalties, a sentiment echoed by others in the 
county. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Callahan, executive director of the nonprofit Orange County Together, said 
such court action sends the message that hate crimes "will not be tolerated." 
</P>
<P>
 "If you do it, you will be open to criminal, civil and all kinds of 
penalties," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Bergen, an attorney who works with the Anti-Defamation League in Los 
Angeles, said more hate-crime victims have been pursuing damages in civil 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Criminal court is fine as far as deterring people from committing other 
crimes and punishing them for the crime they committed, but it doesn't 
compensate the victim," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey Michael Raines, a 19-year-old from San Juan Capistrano whom 
authorities said actually beat Truong, pleaded guilty earlier this year to 
attempted murder and other charges, including the commission of a hate crime. 
He was sentenced to 10 years in state prison, where he remains today. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Michael Cribbins, who authorities said started the attack by 
pushing Truong and then ran away, pleaded guilty to assault and committing a 
hate crime. Cribbins, 23, of San Clemente received a one-year jail sentence, 
which he has served, and was placed on probation for five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither man has hired lawyers to defend them against allegations of assault 
and civil rights violations included in Truong's lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Six of the other eight defendants -- who were accused of negligence in the 
lawsuit -- denied any responsibility for the attack, but settled out of court. 
Kerr said he will likely agree to dismiss the seventh defendant from the 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 That would leave the eighth man originally named in the suit, Edward DaCosta, 
19, on the defendant list with Raines and Cribbins. 
</P>
<P>
 Truong alleges that DaCosta was negligent for driving Raines and Cribbins to 
the scene of the attack and for lending encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
 But DaCosta, who will be the only defendant in court with a lawyer, said he 
had no idea that the attack was planned or likely to occur that Jan. 9 night, 
according to his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a group of kids out for the night and they happened to have this 
guy along who went nuts and pummeled this guy," his lawyer, Stephen Coonzt, 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court records, the group of mostly San Clemente high school 
students had been drinking and hanging out at a Laguna Beach nightclub when 
Raines suggested they "beat up fags." Most of the defendants denied hearing 
such a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, traveling in two carloads, later stopped near several gay bars off 
Coast Highway and Raines and Cribbins went down to the beach where the attack 
occurred, according to court records. 
</P>
<P>
 Police, after receiving calls from witnesses, found Truong's nearly lifeless 
body on the rocky shore. 
</P>
<P>
 John Hill, a professor at Western State University College of Law who did some 
legal research for the suit, said the case could challenge the tradition of 
generally not holding someone liable for failing to prevent harm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can someone be liable for standing around, for failing to rescue or to 
interfere or to tell the assailant to stop?" he asked. "There are some really 
interesting issues here."

DANA PARSONS: BRINGING A LITTLE MAGIC TO A SMALL, SMALL, CRUEL WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the last several years, the Orange County Press Club has treated 
underprivileged children to "A Day at Disneyland." Colleagues who have 
chaperoned say it's richly rewarding to watch the children's faces light up, so 
thankful are they to be treated as special. 
</P>
<P>
 It must be one of life's highest callings to bring joy to someone who sees 
little of it. Who among us wouldn't want to remind someone that they're not 
forgotten, that their hopes and fears matter to us and that we sympathize with 
the seemingly unbearable circumstances of their lives? 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the Press Club is a little behind the times. Yes, children 
growing up in poverty have it tough, but they're hardly society's most needy. 
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, the Press Club should adopt my new program, "Take a Middle-Aged 
White Guy to Disneyland." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if you only watch a little TV or read an occasional magazine, you must 
have heard how awful things are these days for middle-aged white guys. Surely 
you've heard their plaintive laments that they've had it up to here, and, blast 
it all, they just can't take it any more. 
</P>
<P>
 As you reflect on how horrible their lives are, ask yourself: Haven't we 
ignored these long-suffering victims for too long? 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine the joy you could bring to Don, a 48-year-old insurance salesman, if 
you took him by the hand and headed for Pirates of the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 What a difference someone could make in Don's life if they could just break 
through his moody indifference and get at what's eating him. 
</P>
<P>
 What if, just once, someone said to Don: "I hear things are pretty rough for 
you right now. Want to talk about it?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody seems to care about me," Don might well say, unless he was too 
embarrassed to discuss his plight. "The only ones getting any attention are 
people I'm not and never will be: blacks, gays, women, the young, the old, the 
sick, Latinos, Indians, bisexuals, transsexuals, career criminals, pregnant 
teen-agers, couples who can't have babies, skinheads, movie stars, working 
moms, stay-at-home moms, latchkey kids, grandparents who adopt. . . . It starts 
getting a guy down, you know what I mean? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been busting my hump for 25 years and suddenly I'm a bad guy. People 
blame us for holding back minorities -- as if I got it so great myself. I'm not 
holding back anybody, I'm just trying to make my paycheck stretch. Gay parades? 
Gimme a break. When did I ever get a parade? What about Don's Day? You don't 
see me whining about a parade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got three kids; one needs braces, another one needs new clothes or she says 
she'll kill herself and the other one's 14 going on 30. My wife hasn't worked 
for 12 years and says she's feeling stifled. So, I tell her to go get a job and 
she says she's frozen out of the job market and that I shouldn't put so much 
pressure on her. My brother-in-law got two promotions in the last 18 months, 
and I'm stuck at my same salary for the last three years. My wife says she 
doesn't care but then tells me every other day how we need new furniture and 
she can't have any people over with the junk we got in the dining room." 
</P>
<P>
 After an outburst like that, you might want to take Don over to the 
Matterhorn, just to let him air out. Just think how Don would react if you 
bought him the hot dogs and drinks and you stood in line, instead of making him 
do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I could get just a little credit," he'd say. "Unless I'm mistaken, that's 
been me working 50 to 60 hours a week, just so the family can take vacations. 
I'm the guy who always drops people off while I drive around looking for a 
parking spot. I'm the guy who always gets up when we hear noises at night, and 
I'm the guy who hassles the neighbor when his dog goes in our front yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "And while we're at it, I'm tired of being lumped in with these guys who try 
to date their secretaries. Nobody's given me so much as a second look in 15 
years, so get off my back. My hair's falling out and my pants are bunching on 
me all the time, I wake up every night at 3 in the morning and I got gas most 
of the time I'm conscious. I'm not hitting on anybody, and even if I did they'd 
probably shoot me down, and who needs the rejection? 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides that, I haven't played poker in two years, there's no baseball or 
hockey and I couldn't spend as much in six months as my wife does in three 
hours at the mall. All I want to do on weekends is watch a lousy football game, 
and she's got me on the roof sweeping leaves." 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know if even a trip to Disneyland could get middle-aged white guys to 
open up like that. For many of them, their pain is too indelibly set. 
</P>
<P>
 But wouldn't it be worth a try? Wouldn't you feel better knowing you had 
helped someone just like Don? 
</P>
<P>
 Or, better yet, what if you helped them so much you never again had to listen 
to them mourn the cursed existence they're forced to live.

HARD WORK AND HEARTBREAK; THE DAUNTING TASK OF SOCIAL WORKERS WHO AID THE AGED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The voice on the phone was frantic. 
</P>
<P>
 The in-home caregiver was trying in vain to cope with an 84-year-old woman who 
alternately laughed insanely or screamed in pain. The elderly woman -- call her 
Martha -- was suffering from dementia. She refused medicine and food, she was 
shedding weight, she was incontinent and had bedsores. Martha cursed in 
response to pleas that she go to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The caregiver had been especially conscientious in a hard, often thankless job 
that pays only the minimum wage. And now she seemed about to unravel. 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the phone, social worker Glenda Stovall was soothing and 
understanding. But beneath the calm, professional manner, Stovall was worried. 
Martha might be dying -- and Stovall wasn't sure what to do about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Stovall is a crisis intervention social worker for Los Angeles County, and 
this was but one of more than 25 tough cases in her active file. 
</P>
<P>
 Her caseload also included a gaunt elderly woman living alone in a filthy 
apartment strung with spider webs and cluttered with rotting food. The woman 
was demented and covered with lice, but was unable to obtain medical care 
because she had no private insurance and was blocked from getting public 
assistance by a paperwork snarl. 
</P>
<P>
 There was also the case of an elderly couple whose mentally handicapped 
daughter was suspected of physically abusing them. And then there was the 
90-year-old man whose neighbor had been robbing him of his savings and had 
gotten himself written into the elderly man's will. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stovall, who works out of Pasadena, is one of 50 such social workers employed 
by the county Department of Community and Senior Services. Each handles 250 
cases per year. These Adult Protective Services workers, who have offices 
throughout the county, are often overwhelmed, but paid little. Their job is to 
cope with situations involving dementia and unhealthy living conditions among 
older people, as well as problems such as abuse experienced by vulnerable 
people over the age of 18. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of clients are elderly, but some are younger people who are 
handicapped or retarded. The cases are almost always difficult, and frequently, 
they are heartbreaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot always help these people," said Stovall. "Sometimes, there's 
nothing we can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Martha's might be such a case, she feared. 
</P>
<P>
 Stovall's cases come to her from concerned neighbors who call the elder abuse 
hotline and from other social service agencies. Or she might be called by an 
in-home caregiver hired by the county or by relatives of an elderly person. 
</P>
<P>
 As Stovall soothed Martha's caregiver over the phone, a home health care nurse 
arrived at the elderly woman's house to check on her at the social worker's 
request. 
</P>
<P>
 With Stovall still on the phone, the nurse and the home caregiver were somehow 
able to persuade Martha to go to the hospital. The next hurdle, said Stovall, 
would be to get the hospital -- Kaiser Permanente Medical Center on Sunset 
Boulevard -- to admit the woman against her will if she changed her mind, as 
she probably would once she arrived at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of uncooperative but seriously ill patients such as Martha, 
doctors and hospital officials frequently are unwilling to seek involuntary 
commitments, according to Stovall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has to get to the point where people are literally living in their own 
feces," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha appeared to be getting close to that. 
</P>
<P>
 "If she wants to die, that's her right," said Stovall, "but she has to die 
clean -- that's our responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, there were other cases to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stovall routinely works alone, but on this day she was joined by fellow social 
worker Lori Barraza, who has a similar caseload. Their jobs require a 
bachelor's degree, and both majored in social work. Stovall also has a master's 
in counseling and Barraza will soon receive one. Their salary: $33,780 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The women are good friends. They have worked in other social service jobs for 
two decades, they each went back to college in middle-age and they have similar 
reasons for pursuing the demanding, stressful work. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have to go out of this world filthy and not eating, and living in ugly 
circumstances, is just not right," Stovall said of her elderly clients. "To be 
able to help them out of that, makes me feel better -- that I've done a little 
something, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Stovall and Barraza climbed into an Isuzu Rodeo and swept onto the Foothill 
Freeway heading toward Los Angeles. Barraza was at the wheel of her van as 
Stovall used a cellular phone to alert hospital personnel that Martha was on 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is going to say she doesn't want to stay, but that's because of the 
dementia," Stovall told a hospital worker. "She cannot go home." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Barraza had pulled off the freeway and parked on a side 
street near a rundown apartment house where another client lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, Catherine -- the names of clients have been changed for reasons of 
confidentiality -- stood on a filthy rug in the living room. The 86-year-old 
woman was skeletal, her hair hung lank and dirt was caked in the lines of her 
face. Catherine's eyes were wide and vacant as she smiled at the social 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 There was garbage on the kitchen floor, the sink was caked with filth, the 
stove top was rusty and unused. In the refrigerator were old, partially eaten 
TV dinners brought by Meals on Wheels. Kitchen shelves were dense with spider 
webs, studded with dead roaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Stovall had been here before, but Catherine didn't recognize her. 
</P>
<P>
 When had Catherine last seen a doctor, asked Stovall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't go to doctors," Catherine replied pleasantly. 
</P>
<P>
 And that, Stovall said as she left, must change. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to get her hospitalized," said Stovall as she got back into the van. 
"I think she has the potential to improve. I would like to put her in board and 
care." 
</P>
<P>
 Catherine is a foreign national living permanently in the U.S. She is eligible 
for Medi-Cal and aid through Social Security, but the woman's ex-husband had 
possession of vital information and paperwork and was uncooperative. 
</P>
<P>
 Her case had been referred to Stovall months ago and she thought she had 
resolved it by locating the necessary paperwork, but Catherine had somehow 
fallen through the cracks in the social services system until a senior center 
called about her condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Barraza had by now pulled to the curb in front of a well-kept apartment 
building to check on one of her own clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa is a 75-year-old widow whose daughter died early this year. She has 
developed a pattern of binge drinking. Barraza had been unable to reach the 
woman by phone, and her concern mounted as she repeatedly pounded on the door 
and called the woman's name to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 When Lisa finally answered the door, the pleasant, soft-spoken woman was not 
drunk, but acknowledged that she had fallen into depression. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why lately I've been feeling like this," she said. "I don't even 
want to get dressed or go anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, Lisa makes sojourns to a nearby market just to get out of the house 
despite grotesquely swollen and painful ankles. 
</P>
<P>
 But lately, the depression had kept her inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even clean the house or anything," she said. "I just lay around and 
sleep and watch TV. Sometimes I don't eat at all. I just drink coffee." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Lisa was planning a trip to see a granddaughter in another state. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Barraza asked permission to look around the apartment that was cluttered and 
over-furnished, but nonetheless clean. There were knickknacks and family 
snapshots everywhere. When Barraza returned to the living room, she asked Lisa 
if she had ever thought about harming herself. Lisa denied any such notions. 
</P>
<P>
 But back in the car, Barraza was even more worried than she had been before 
the visit. In Lisa's bedroom, the social worker had found brochures from the 
Hemlock Society, a group that provides information on suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Stovall's job is doing what amounts to preliminary detective work into 
complaints that elderly people are being swindled. 
</P>
<P>
 That afternoon in the office, Stovall phoned a man she termed a "perp" -- 
short for perpetrator. A senior citizens center had called to say that 
90-year-old Carl had been fleeced by a neighbor. Another social services agency 
had been able to put the man's financial affairs in the hands of an old and 
trusted friend, but Stovall would now look into the alleged crime. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lengthy phone conversation, Stovall persistently but gently questioned 
the suspected perp. The man said that he had begun running errands and doing 
chores for Carl when the elderly man could no longer take care of himself. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing led to another, he said, and Carl began signing checks for his 
neighbor to cover various expenses. Stovall had already determined that $10,000 
had been drained from the elderly man's bank account over a short period, 
leaving a balance of $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspected perp readily admitted to Stovall that he used $1,500 of Carl's 
money to get a lawyer to write a will leaving all the old man's money to him. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time she hung up, Stovall was convinced that the helpful neighbor had 
indeed helped himself to the vulnerable elder's savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, before she left the office on that Friday evening, Stovall was 
assured by a Kaiser intern that Martha would be admitted to the hospital or 
placed in a convalescent home for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Often, crisis intervention workers are able to solve a problem and close a 
case. Sometimes they are not. Some cases come back again and again, perhaps 
never to be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some updates on the crisis situations Stovall and Barraza handled on 
that recent Friday: 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Carl and the helpful neighbor, Stovall turned her findings over 
to police, who opened a criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lisa's case, Barraza phoned the out-of-state granddaughter, who was so 
concerned that she arranged for the elderly woman to come and live with her. 
</P>
<P>
 In Catherine's case, Stovall used information supplied by the Canadian Embassy 
to obtain an emergency Medi-Cal card for the elderly woman. Catherine was 
hospitalized and Stovall hopes to have her admitted to a board and care home. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is going to be fine," predicted Stovall. "She's going to be taken care 
of." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is the case of Martha. 
</P>
<P>
 Stovall thought Martha was safely in the hospital for the weekend, but she 
learned the following Monday that the woman had been sent home and had spent 
two to three days alone and without food. 
</P>
<P>
 A Kaiser official said that Martha's medical information is confidential, but 
went on to say that involuntary admissions must be made with care. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot force a patient who has the capacity to make decisions to take any 
treatment or to be transferred to a facility against their will," said Kit 
Neimeyer, area public affairs director for Kaiser. "This particular case is 
very complex," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the days that followed, Stovall was able, with the help of the in-home 
caregiver and a hospital social worker, to persuade Martha to admit herself to 
Kaiser.  
</P>
<P>
 While she was there, the elder abuse hotline received a call from a hospital 
employee who was concerned that Martha would be discharged. 
</P>
<P>
 The information from the employee, who asked to remain anonymous, was relayed 
to Stovall: 
</P>
<P>
 "Client is unable to care for self. Requires skilled nursing, but refuses to 
stay. Client is extremely frail. Doesn't take medication. Has a history of 
dementia. Was admitted to Kaiser for skin infection and malnutrition. . . . 
Suffered a fractured hip in early '94. Has a history of bleeding ulcer. Subject 
to fainting episodes . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Martha stayed in the hospital a week and was again discharged to her home. 
</P>
<P>
 When Stovall went to Martha's home to check on her, the frail old woman came 
to the door and, barely able to stand, greeted the social worker with 
hostility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to see you," she said in a surprisingly strong voice. "Mind your 
own business." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll leave you alone for now," said Stovall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It better be forever," said Martha. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stovall won't stay away forever. She was able to locate Martha's attorney 
and a daughter in another city who did not know of her mother's grave 
condition. She was also able to locate a substantial bank account that Martha 
had misplaced. 
</P>
<P>
 The daughter, the lawyer and the faithful, long-suffering caregiver are doing 
what they can to aid Martha, but she remains belligerent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're right back to square one," said Stovall, "but we do have people 
involved and I think they will get her into a board and care." In the meantime, 
Martha's daughter and caregiver have found that the elderly woman will 
cooperate to some extent if they make a certain threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Martha hates me so much," said Stovall, "that all they have to do is mention 
that Glenda Stovall is going to come over. They even got her to bathe."

SCOTT HARRIS: CURING AN IDENTITY CRISIS ON THE INTERNET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS, Address TimesLink or Prodigy e-mail to YQTU59A (via the 
Internet: YQTU59A@prodigy.com). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It happened again this week. But this was the first time it happened in 
cyberspace. 
</P>
<P>
 A person who signed his name "Stan B." was the culprit. His message on the 
Internet began like this: Ron , . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Now, please take another look at the name on this column. It should say Scott 
Harris , unless some editor is trying to mess with my mind. In any case, it 
shouldn't say Ron Harris , because I'm not Ron. I'm Scott. And, for the record, 
I'm not Kathryn or Lee or Zonker or any other Harris whose name may appear in 
this newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 People started confusing Ron and me more than a year ago, when our columns ran 
on consecutive days in the same spot in the Metro Edition. Here in the Valley 
Edition, my column runs on Sunday, Tuesday and Thursday, but in Metro it only 
runs on Thursday. So I was the Thursday Harris, and Ron was the Friday Harris. 
This was the pattern until a few months ago, when Ron joined the foreign staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it should be easy to tell us apart. Here are some key distinctions: 
02,23,26 Ron Scott Rio de Janeiro Chatsworth Carnival! San Fernando Valley Fair 
The Samba Aftershocks Ipanema Sepulveda Basin The Girl from Ipanema Vals Lucky 
son-of-a... Darn Glad to Be Here Does everybody get that? Ron is the Harris who 
gets to cruise the Amazon. I'm the Harris who gets to cruise Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been a few months, yet I still get mail and messages meant for Ron. By 
now it seems safe to say that more people have mistaken me for Ron than have 
ever mistaken me for the only Scott Harris who to my knowledge has ever made 
international news. This would be the Scott Harris who a few years back 
parachuted into Elizabeth Taylor's latest wedding at Michael Jackson's 
Neverland ranch. That day, a Chicago radio station called me at home, eager for 
an interview. Looking back, I should have given them a hell of a story. 
</P>
<P>
 The name Scott Harris isn't, say, John Smith, but it's common enough. Although 
I've never met the famous wedding correspondent, I've said hello to three other 
Scott Harrises in my lifetime. But I'd wager that none of them have ever been 
confused for Ron.Often, this has been a source of amusement. My colleague David 
Colker recently fielded a call from a reader asking him to settle a 
disagreement: "Is Scott Harris black or white?" 
</P>
<P>
 Now, David is pretty sure I'm white--at least as white as the guy whose photo 
appears with this column. The Metro Edition, however, doesn't run such photos, 
so we should probably assume that this caller was from over the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, David didn't think it was his place to discuss something as 
personal as my heritage. He urged the woman to call back and ask me personally. 
I'm not sure if it was the same woman, but somebody did indeed call last week 
who meandered a bit before asking me this question. 
</P>
<P>
 I gave her my usual explanation. "A lot of people confuse me with Ron Harris. 
Happens all the time. He's black. I'm white. He ran on Friday. I run on 
Thursday. Now he's in Rio. I'm in Chatsworth. And I'm darn glad to be here!" 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, the confusion has been interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 Several months ago, after I wrote a column about the police search for a black 
suspect in the so-called "Valley Molester" case, a reader called to say he was 
tired of blacks complaining that they are always treated like criminal 
suspects. Climbing atop his soapbox, he declared that the biggest problem today 
is reverse racism. 
</P>
<P>
 He said something like: "Now white guys are being treated like. . .," and here 
he used the infamous N-word. Then he said it a couple more times. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't realize it then, but a few minutes later I said something about how 
"guys like us" don't have to worry about being harassed by police searching for 
this particular suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a pause. "You mean. . . you're not black?" 
</P>
<P>
 If he had known, would he have bothered to call? 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever. The confusion should start to subside. In the meantime, I'm still 
trying to figure out exactly who "Stan B." is. 
</P>
<P>
 In his message, he made it clear that he is a retired editor at "the by God LA 
Times." 
</P>
<P>
 I immediately thought of a Stan B. who recently departed the national desk and 
promptly sent him a message. But further inquiry suggests it's probably a 
different Stan B., who retired several years earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 People probably get them mixed up all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Harris' column appears Tuesdays, Thursdays and Sundays.

BROWNS AID CHARITY AGAINST SPOUSE ABUSE; AWARENESS: FATHER OF O.J. SIMPSON'S 
SLAIN WIFE MAKES BRIEF STATEMENT BEFORE BALL FOR INTERVAL HOUSE CRISIS 
SHELTERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Slowly emerging from their seclusion, the family of Nicole Brown Simpson made 
a brief appearance Saturday night at a charity ball to raise awareness about 
domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Abused women is something that is a current topic," said Lou Brown, Nicole 
Simpson's father. "And we are here to let you know we believe in it and the 
family supports it in every way. And that's all we have to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was flanked by his wife, Judy, daughters Tanya and Dominique and two 
bodyguards at a black-tie fund raiser for the Interval House Crisis Shelters, 
which has four facilities in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 O.J. Simpson's former father-in-law read his brief statement at a press 
reception at the Ritz Carlton, then declined to answer questions as the family 
was escorted to the hotel's main ballroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual event, attended by comedian Jo Anne Worley and actress Lee 
Meriwether, was expected to raise $150,000 for the shelters, which provide 
emergency housing and counseling for victims of domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 After calling a press conference at the hotel, shelter officials then asked 
media representatives to sign a statement promising they would not "barrage" 
the Brown family with questions about the O.J. Simpson double-murder trial or 
other personal matters. Robert W. Armstrong, the event's organizer, said the 
gala was meant to publicize the crisis of domestic violence, not intrude on the 
Brown family. 
</P>
<P>
 Most media organizations declined to sign the document. "We don't normally 
agree to restrictions on our editorial judgments," said Lynda Armel Nikula, an 
assignment editor with CNN's Los Angeles bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 However, at least one news organization complied -- KTLA news in Los Angeles. 
KTLA officials would not comment on their decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Brown Simpson's older sister, Denise Brown, did not attend Saturday 
night's charity event, but has spoken several times recently about her interest 
in helping victims of domestic violence, and about an evolution in her views of 
her sister's marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I realize that Nicole was a battered woman, something I never knew 
before," Denise Brown said in a recent interview. Soon after her sister's death 
June 12, Denise Brown had denied that Nicole was abused by Simpson, despite the 
release of a dramatic 911 tape in which a frightened Nicole begged police to 
protect her from her enraged husband. 
</P>
<P>
 The change in her thinking, Denise Brown said, came after she and other family 
members discovered notes among Nicole's belongings that detailed apparent 
incidents of abuse. Denise Brown would not elaborate on the contents of the 
notes, but said they were written by her sister. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't even have to talk to her friends," Denise Brown said. "I read it in 
her own papers, notes that she kept for herself. . . . You couldn't help but 
come to the conclusion that she was a battered woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Denise Brown said the discovery has prompted her to try to educate herself 
about domestic violence and has sparked her growing interest in helping abused 
women, in memory of her sister. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just didn't know enough about it before," she said. "This is going to be my 
cause in life now, something I do for Nicole and for me. It's something I've 
just got to do."

POLITICS '94: A BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY'S POLITICAL LIFE ; 
DORNAN REALLY DIGGING OCCUPYING CAPITOL DIGS OF OUSTED SPEAKER FOLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Room with a liberal view: When it came time for the Republicans to select 
their new Capitol Hill offices as they assume the reins of power, the choice 
made by Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) proved to be a harbinger of the 
days to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Dornan, staunch conservative and thorn in the side of many Democrats, will be 
moving into the congressional offices of outgoing House Speaker Tom Foley (his 
personal suite in the Longworth House Office Building, not to be confused with 
the official Speaker's digs at the Capitol). 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Keeter, Dornan's aide, said the suite was selected because it is 
roomier, more conveniently located, and "the icing on the cake is the beautiful 
view of the Capitol." Of course, Dornan also delighted in the fact that it's 
Foley's office. 
</P>
<P>
 No word yet on whether Dornan plans to call "Ghostbusters" to rid the office 
of Democratic spirits, but Keeter said the staff "will be instilling Republican 
virtues in that office and ridding it of all Democratic tendencies." 
</P>

<P>
 Ready and waiting: The city of Lake Forest is eager to again challenge the 
legality of Measure A, the Nov. 8 initiative that could put a commercial 
airport at the El Toro Marine base, said a confident Jerry M. Patterson, the 
city attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson, a former congressman from Santa Ana, said Measure A is illegal for 
six reasons -- all of them technical but nevertheless important. Primarily, he 
said, the measure creates an inconsistency in the county General Plan by 
increasing the intensity of the development on the base without addressing what 
would be a threefold increase in traffic in the area.

 "Courts have held repeatedly that ordinances not consistent with a general 
plan are illegal," Patterson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Using basically the same arguments, the city was unsuccessful at keeping 
Measure A off the ballot, but Patterson said the judge acknowledged "that we 
raised some good points." 
</P>
<P>
 Patterson is also awaiting a California Supreme Court decision that is "right 
on point" with this issue -- De Vita vs. Sonoma County -- where slow-growth 
supporters are trying to prevent the conversion of vineyards to commercial and 
residential development.

 On the rise: Assemblywoman-elect Marilyn C. Brewer (R-Newport Beach) hasn't 
even been sworn in yet, but her status in Sacramento already appears to be 
rising. Brewer, who was elected to represent the ultra-Republican 70th 
District, was asked -- she's not saying by whom -- to second Garden Grove 
Assemblyman Curt Pringle's nomination of colleague Jim Brulte (R-Rancho 
Cucamonga) as the leader of the state's Republican caucus at a meeting Nov. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Just being asked is considered an honor, and Brewer said she readily accepted. 
She added that she is 100% behind Brulte in the up-and-coming battle for 
Republican leadership in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer, the owner of a manufacturing company, also said the Orange County 
delegation of Assembly Republicans plans to take a hard look during the coming 
months at onerous regulations placed on business people in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you're going to see a very proactive Orange County delegation," 
Brewer said. 
</P>

 The wild 69th: Newly reelected Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) claims to 
have uncovered some serious discrepancies in the voting patterns of Democrats 
in the 69th Assembly District, the site of a recent slugfest won by fellow 
Republican Jim Morrissey. 
</P>
<P>
 Morrissey beat Democrat Mike Metzler by about 3,000 votes, but Conroy said the 
turnout in the largely blue-collar, Latino district in Santa Ana and northward 
between Anaheim and Orange to the Riverside Freeway was down from 1992 by about 
9,000 votes, largely because Republicans complained to the registrar of voters 
that many Democrats in the district were registering twice, Conroy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have very good indications that there was quite a bit of wrongful voting 
in this district over the years . . . but this year was probably more flagrant 
in voting hanky-panky," said Conroy, a Santa Ana resident for 24 years whose 
own district used to include much of what is now the 69th. He said his staff is 
undertaking a complete review of the vote and will make the results known soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorianne Garcia, chairwoman of the Orange County Democratic Party, scoffed at 
Conroy's claims as nothing but more hot air and partisan politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Mickey) has a big mouth and he's just trying to act like (Rep. Robert K.) 
Dornan," Garcia said. "But, like Dornan, he's all talk and no action. If he 
feels he has evidence to substantiate these charges, he ought to be forthright 
and come forward. If he doesn't have any, he should spend his time taking care 
of the job the people are paying him to do." 
</P>

 Another battle ahead: Fresh from a wild election campaign featuring 22 
candidates, the Huntington Beach City Council appears headed for a long, 
perhaps costly battle to fill the seat of departing Councilman Jim Silva, who 
was elected to the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Some council members favor holding a special election, which could cost 
$150,000, while others believe that downtown restaurant owner Susie Newman, who 
came in fifth in a race for four seats, should be appointed. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman-elect Peter Green said he prefers a special election because 
"citizens should decide who they want to represent them. It's too important, 
since it is an elected office. . . . (It) might cause an ill feeling if we go 
down the list to appoint someone" who ran and lost in the recent election. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Garofalo, who also was elected to the council earlier this month, said he 
feels morally compelled to appoint Newman. "I find it difficult to reject the 
fifth highest vote-getter" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garofalo predicted that the issue is "either going to be a team-building 
experience or it's going to be a major schism between the council for the next 
two years." 
</P>
<P>
 The council will have two months to decide what to do after Silva is sworn in 
on the Board of Supervisors Jan. 3. If no decision is made in 60 days, the city 
clerk must call a special election.

ANAHEIM BLAZES CAUSE DAMAGES TO 2 DWELLINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Firefighters battled two residential blazes Friday night and Saturday and 
managed to extinguish both before anyone was injured, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first fire broke out in the kitchen of an apartment in the 900 block of 
West Romneya Drive at 10:18 p.m. Friday and spread into the walls and attics of 
two other apartments, according to a Fire Department spokesman.Eighteen 
firefighters responded and the damage was estimated at $110,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Another fire was reported about 2:10 p.m. Saturday in a bedroom of a 1920s-era 
home in the 300 block of South East Street in the downtown area. The fire 
apparently started in a space heater and was contained to the bedroom area, 
according to Battalion Chief Roger Smith of the Anaheim Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The four adults and two children who live in the home were temporarily forced 
to stay with relatives and friends, Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Damages were estimated at $15,000 to the home's structure and $5,000 to its 
contents.

6 ARRESTED AFTER 2 POLICE CHASES IN ANAHEIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police arrested four suspected gang members on suspicion of assault with a 
deadly weapon, auto theft and possession of narcotics after a high-speed car 
chase, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pursuit was one of two police chases in the city Saturday.It began about 4 
p.m. near Orangewood Avenue and Haster Street when an Anaheim police officer 
spotted a vehicle that had been carjacked in Livermore on Thursday, Sgt. Thomas 
Lahmon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers pursued the car and stopped the driver at Chapman Avenue and Haster 
Street after the car had careened into a police cruiser, Lahmon said.  
</P>
<P>
 The four juveniles ran and were quickly rounded up. Police fired one shot 
during the foot chase, but no one was injured, according to police.  
</P>
<P>
 "One round was fired but nobody was hit and nobody was hurt," Lahmon said.  
</P>
<P>
 The suspects, who were all on probation for other criminal offenses, are being 
held in Orange County Juvenile Hall, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, at the east end of the city, another pursuit began at about 4:30 
p.m. near Pageant Street and Bainbridge Avenue when Anaheim police officers 
spotted another car that had been reported stolen, Lahmon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys chased it all over the east end of Anaheim, along the pedestrian 
trail of a river bed until the driver lost control and stopped," Lahmon said.  
</P>
<P>
 The fleeing car apparently was struck by a police cruiser and knocked off the 
trail onto the bank of the river, Lahmon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two people were being held, he said. No names or additional details were 
available late Saturday.

GARDEN GROVE CITY COUNCIL APPROVES PACT FOR 85 NEW BUS-STOP SHELTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The contract for another 85 bus-stop shelters has been approved by the City 
Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Bustop Shelters of California will immediately install 50 of the shelters and 
the rest will be phased in over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 373 bus stops around the city, 75 have shelters, according to J. David 
Kennon, the city's development services director. Bustop Shelters holds the 
license to 50 of those shelters, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beside providing a service to the community, the bus-stop shelters give the 
city additional income through license fees, which will amount to nearly 
$10,000 a month, Kennon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bus shelter operators make money by leasing space to advertisers. Bustop 
Shelters, which is based in Irvine, has ties with Van Wager Communication, an 
agent for several national advertising companies. BERT ELJERA

WOMAN KILLED, DRIVER ARRESTED AFTER RIVERSIDE FREEWAY CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An 18-year-old Rialto woman was killed and a motorist was arrested on 
suspicion of manslaughter Saturday when the car they were traveling in flipped 
on a freeway, rolled over several times and came to a stop in the center 
divider, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, Lajuan Thomas, was tossed from the car shortly after it began to 
roll on the Riverside Freeway, said a spokesman for the California Highway 
Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, one of two passengers in the 1988 Hyundai Excel, was riding in the 
right side of the front seat, said Rick McAnally, an Orange County coroner's 
deputy. She was taken to Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Anaheim where she 
died at 2:56 p.m., he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, Marshall A. Williams Jr., 18, of Colton, was westbound on the 
freeway near Coal Canyon Road at 2:08 p.m. when the Hyundai drifted to the 
right and Williams then over-corrected to the left, causing the car to veer 
across two lanes and strike the center divider, the spokesman said. The car 
then rolled several times before it landed upright. 
</P>
<P>
 Several passing motorists stopped and attempted to aid Thomas until paramedics 
arrived, according to the CHP. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was treated for minor injuries and then arrested on suspicion of 
vehicular manslaughter and booked into Orange County Jail, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other passenger also was treated for a minor injury, authorities said.

VOICES: LIVING ON FAITH; JACQUELYN DUPONT-WALKER, HEAD OF AN INDEPENDENT 
DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION, DESCRIBES THE INSPIRATION BEHIND WARD VILLAS, A 
120-UNIT APARTMENT COMPLEX FOR LOW-INCOME SENIOR CITIZENS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN K. KLEIN, Jacquelyn Dupont-Walker, 48, is president of the Ward 
Economic Development Corp., an independent community development organization 
affiliated with the Ward African Methodist Episcopal Church in South-Central 
Los Angeles. The nonprofit corporation designed and developed the Ward Villas, 
a 120-unit low-income senior citizens' apartment complex at Magnolia Avenue and 
Adams Boulevard, which opened in 1992. Dupont-Walker has worked in the fields 
of social work, mental health, community organizing and politics. She lives in 
Lafayette Square with her husband, Sonny. Between them they have eight grown 
children, the youngest of whom is a college junior. She was interviewed by 
Karen E. Klein. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ward Economic Development Corp. is an example of what I like to call 
faith-based community development. I believe people must be given access to 
opportunity and resources to make a difference in their neighborhoods. And I 
believe very strongly that faith-based communities are the ones with the 
greatest integrity and the longest staying power, whether they are doing 
housing development, leadership development, economic entrepreneurship or 
neighborhood development. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a significant network of projects across the country that originated 
from what I call faith-based development. And there will be more and more as 
time goes on -- there are no longer the resources in government to do them. 
</P>
<P>
 We are starting to see outsiders viewing these developments as good 
investments and grass-roots groups are taken seriously, they are not looked at 
just as do-gooders. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was not always true. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, our minister at the time challenged all the church members to find 
their own ministries. The AME church has a 207-year legacy of helping the 
disadvantaged. I am a social worker and community organizer by training, and I 
have always had that yearning and burning to do work like this. 
</P>
<P>
 I guess the vision came from my father, who was a minister in Tallahassee, 
Fla. He was a builder by trade. He built churches, but he always dreamed of 
senior housing being built so he and his friends could have a place to retire 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 So, after our minister gave that call to ministry, a number of us started 
looking at the community immediately surrounding the church and began to see 
that it was changing in character and in nature. 
</P>
<P>
 Call it gentrification, call it historical renovation, the bottom line was 
displacement of the people who were already there and who happened to be poor 
and who happened to be of color. And there was no one standing in the gap for 
these people who had no voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of us felt that if we were to be true to our legacy and true to our 
Christian walk, we could not sit by and watch what was happening in our 
community because we were neighbors in that community. 
</P>
<P>
 So we started studying other churches that were in urban neighborhoods in 
transition and saw how they ministered to the people who were there. We visited 
and corresponded with a number of churches across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 After about six months, we concluded that we needed to be an independent 
organization involved in community education, on the cutting edge of issues and 
that we had to actually produce something. We found that in our communities we 
didn't have much product. We had processes, plans, concepts and scenarios, but 
no product. 
</P>
<P>
 We wanted from the very beginning to do the right thing and to do things 
right. 
</P>
<P>
 I worked for Ward EDC for three years without a salary. My husband knew what 
this meant to me and he said, "I understand this is something you have to do." 
We've always had that kind of relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 We just determined the minimum amount of money I had to bring in per month so 
we could maintain our family, and I did that and devoted all the rest of my 
time to working for Ward EDC. 
</P>
<P>
 Our reputation and our commitment had a dollar value; we insisted on being the 
managing general partner of the Ward Villas. We had regular team meetings, so 
everybody watched what was going on every step of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1950s, HUD had a number of churches that were sponsors for 
low-income housing projects. They used the goodwill and the integrity of these 
churches, but the people were not actively involved in any of the details of 
the projects. Most of those facilities are now owned by other kinds of 
syndicate groups because the churches did not have a long-term interest in 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 The project is now 100% full, with a waiting list. I am working with lending 
organizations to help them develop policies on how to work with community-based 
developers. 
</P>
<P>
 We are very serious about putting together an economic development piece, 
possibly looking into commercial ventures that can provide entrepreneurship 
opportunities in our community. 
</P>
<P>
 The main thing we need to remember is that it is more important to be 
proactive than reactionary.

GAME OF THE WEEK; DORSEY TURNS TAFT INTO THE HEARTBREAK KIDS; WITH SECONDS 
LEFT, DONS' ANTWAIN WILSON RETURNS AN INTERCEPTION FOR THE WINNING TOUCHDOWN, 
26-20 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Dons defensive back Antwain Wilson intercepted a pass and raced untouched down 
the sideline for a 65-yard touchdown as time expired to defeat Taft, 26-20, in 
a 4-A Division quarterfinal on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey (10-2) advances to the semifinals next week against Crenshaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing 20-7 with only five minutes to play, Dorsey scored twice to tie the 
score. But when the Dorsey kicker missed a tiebreaking extra-point attempt, and 
Taft recovered a subsequent onside kick at its own 44-yard line with 34 seconds 
to play, overtime appeared a certainty. 
</P>
<P>
 But Taft was looking for a quicker finish to the evening. With 10 seconds to 
play and the ball at the 50, quarterback Dayon Shaw tried one last pass to get 
into range for a winning field goal, a sideline route to DaShon Polk. The pass 
was overthrown, right into the chest of Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the best thing that ever happened to me in my whole life," Wilson said 
while standing in the middle of a jubilant crowd. "I told the guys, 'Never get 
your head down, because anything can happen'--as you can see." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second consecutive season the Toreadors have lost to Dorsey in the 
playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft appeared to have the game well in hand after scoring two touchdowns in 
the fourth quarter to take a 20-7 lead. The first came on a 23-yard pass from 
Shaw to running back Dion Gaston on a third-down play. Taft missed the extra 
point and led, 12-7. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dorsey's next play, quarterback Roderick Brown fumbled the exchange and 
Toreador lineman Juan Madera recovered at the Dons' 18-yard line. Two plays 
later, Shaw ran 16 yards on a bootleg for the touchdown, and Gaston ran in the 
two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Taft players relished the thought of avenging last season's 33-7 loss 
to Dorsey, the Dons struck quickly. They needed only three plays to score after 
Raymont Skaggs returned the kickoff 43 yards, cutting the lead to six points on 
a 25-yard pass from Brown to Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came what has proved the bane of Taft--the onside kick. For the third 
time in two playoff games, the Toreadors were unable to recover the squib kick, 
and Dorsey took over at the 50. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just couldn't get a bounce," Taft lineman Edwin Preza said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine plays later, Dorsey's Brown scored on a three-yard keeper. Raul Menjivar 
missed the extra point to keep the score tied. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our dream just went down the drain," Preza said. "It was time for people to 
step up and show their character. We just couldn't pull it out."

BELL RINGS UP VENICE, 29-3, TO ADVANCE TO SEMIFINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bell High quarterback Gus Valenzuela said his team wasn't quite focused 
against Venice on Wednesday night. But it was hard to find fault with the 
Eagles in their 29-3 victory in the City Section 3-A quarterfinal playoff game 
at Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell outgained the Gondoliers, 343-39, in offensive yardage and had four 
sacks. Cornerbacks Omar Guerrero and Dulio Orellana also intercepted a pass 
each to help the Eagles advance to the semifinals for the first time since 
1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela completed nine of 17 passes for 133 yards, six to Dicky Purcell for 
86 yards and touchdown, to raise his season total to 1,889 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out heads were out of it," Valenzuela said. "We didn't play to our 
potential." 
</P>
<P>
 Bell didn't need to thanks to the play of Venice's special teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Punting deep in their own territory, the Gondoliers snapped the ball out of 
the end zone to give Bell a 2-0 lead midway through the first quarter. After 
the free-kick, the Eagles drove 56 yards to increase their lead to 9-0 on an 
11-yard pass from Valenzuela to Purcell. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-yard punt in the third quarter gave the Eagles' possession at the 
Venice 20-yard line. Bell needed only three plays to increase its lead to 29-0 
on a two-yard run by Vern Benard. 
</P>

 Benard and fullback Juan Diaz rushed for two touchdowns each. Benard rushed 
for 101 yards in 16 carries to surpass the 100-yard mark for the seventh time

 "Our defense gave the offense good field position," Bell Coach Henry Santiago 
said. "We were trying to read them and mix it up on defense. We just took what 
they gave us."

STINGY MATER DEI DEFENSE SHUTS DOWN LOYOLA, 31-7

 Kyle Spielbuehler returned to quarterback the Loyola offense, but the Cubs 
were missing their magic touch against Santa Ana Mater Dei. 
</P>
<P>
 Under pressure throughout the game, Spielbuehler completed only four of 13 
passes for 41 yards as the Cubs tumbled to a 31-7 loss to Mater Dei Friday in 
the Southern Section Division I quarterfinal game at Cerritos College. 
</P>
<P>
 After fielding a high snap, punter Michael Giamtaolo threw a desperation pass, 
which was intercepted by Byron Schley. Mater Dei scored three plays later on 
Joey Trampush's five-yard run to take a 10-0 lead in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Scott Walter, the Cubs quarterback of the future, struggled in the 
first half, completing four of 10 passes for 36 yards with two interceptions. 
His first interception led to the Monarchs' second touchdown, a 21-yard pass 
from quarterback John Flynn to Rod Perry. 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei's defensive line shut down Loyola's running game and put pressure on 
Loyola quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Spielbuehler, who suffered from a left sprain ankle, became the Cubs 
quarterback in the second half, but had trouble scrambling. He connected with 
Dan Farmer on a 39-yard pass play to set up Mark Vanis' four-yard touchdown 
run. Vanis rushed for 38 yards in 11 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn completed passes of 48, 21 and 28 yards to Perry to allow the Monarchs 
to escape fourth-and-long situations.

NOTEBOOK; GARFIELD WINS CITY CROSS-COUNTRY TITLE, ITS FIRST SINCE 1963 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Paced by runner-up Richard Martinez, Garfield edged Palisades to win its first 
City championship since 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 Garfield had 43 points to Palisades' 48. Belmont, winner of 10 of the 12 
previous championships, was third with 65 points in the Nov. 19 meet. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the eighth title for Garfield, which also won championships in 1950 and 
1954-58. It took teamwork and putting earlier setbacks against Palisades aside 
to do it. The Dolphins defeated the Bulldogs to win the Kenny Staub 
invitational in October and in the semifinals Nov. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the kind of team that starts off easy at the beginning and finishes 
strong at the end of the season," Martinez said. "We knew in our hearts once 
our guys picked it up midway through the season, we could do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Gilmore of Palisades led from the start to win in 14 minutes 56 seconds 
-- the fastest winning time in 11 years -- and the Dolphins placed three 
runners among the top six. 
</P>
<P>
 But Garfield's depth was decisive. In addition to second-place Martinez 
(15:25), the Bulldogs received seventh- and ninth-place finishes from David 
Jimenez (15:54) and Eddie Sanchez (16:00). Garfield also placed its fourth, 
fifth and sixth runners, Junior Camacho (16:24), Armando Morales (16:29) and 
Raul Cabrera (16:37), in 19th, 20th and 26th place, ahead of Palisades' No. 5 
runner, who finished in 31st. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew their fifth man was going to hurt (Palisades)," Martinez said. "But 
we weren't going after the fifth guy. Our strategy was to go after their third 
and fourth and surround them." 
</P>
<P>
 The top two teams and five individuals not on a qualifying team advanced to 
the State championships at Woodward Park in Fresno on Saturday. Martinez placed 
sixth in last year's City finals to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs will be making their first trip to the State meet as a team (the 
first State meet took place in 1987). Garfield was runner-up in the 1990 City 
meet, but a scoring error allowed Taft to advance as the No. 2 team. 
</P>
<P>
 Delfina Martinez of Belmont won the girls' race in 18:58, but the five-time 
defending champion Sentinels were no match for Palisades, which won its first 
City title in 13 years with 54 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Taft and Huntington Park were second and third with 64 and 109 points. Belmont 
was fourth with 127. 
</P>
<P>
 Manuel Lopez of Belmont, who placed third in the boys' race in 15:32, and 
Lourdes Menchaca of Huntington Park (19:15) and Aida Rochin of Garfield 
(19:38), who were third and eighth in the girls' race, also qualified for the 
State meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Salesian earned its second consecutive berth in the State meet in the Southern 
Section finals at Mt. San Antonio College. Eduardo Santillan was sixth in 16:21 
to lead the Mustangs to a third-place finish in Division IV. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The East L.A. College soccer team defeated Orange Coast, 3-0, in the first 
round of the Southern California Regional playoffs. Sergio Vasquez scored twice 
and Ricardo Saucedo had another goal for the Huskies on Tuesday. East L.A. 
(18-2-1) played San Diego City at home Saturday. The winner advances to the 
State championships in Sacramento Dec. 3-4. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The first Corrida de Campeones Nov. 20 generated fast times and more than 
$5,000 in scholarships for Latino students in East Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The elite 10,000-meter race featured some of the world's top runners, 
competing for $20,000 in prize money. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillimon Hanneck, 23, the Zimbabwe national record-holder in the 1,500, 3,000 
and 5,000 meters, won the men's race in 28 minutes 23 seconds. Jeff Schiebler 
of Canada, 20, and Mbarak Hussein of Kenya, 26, were second and third in 28:44 
and 28:46. 
</P>
<P>
 Poland's Kamila Gradus, 27, pulled away from Lucy Nusrala in the final two 
miles of the 6.2-mile race to win the women's division by eight seconds in 
33:32. Darcy Arreola, 26, of Valencia, the 1991 NCAA 1,500-meter champion from 
Cal State Northridge, was third in 33:47. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanneck and Gradus won $4,000 each in the event, which will be televised on 
ESPN's "Running and Racing." Second and third-place finishers were awarded 
$2,500 and $1,250.

FOOTBALL ROUNDUP; WILSON PULLS AWAY FROM WASHINGTON

<TEXT>
<P>
 Backed by the passing arm of Eddie Gonzalez and rushing of Arlin Slayton, the 
Mules exploded for 20 points in the second half to beat Washington, 27-11, in a 
City 3-A quarterfinal game at Wilson High. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzalez passed for 159 yards and a touchdown.Slayton rushed for 157 yards and 
two touchdowns in 21 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gonzalez was the guy who was our trigger man," Wilson Coach Eddie Martinez 
said. "He's been our key man all year. We couldn't sit on the lead. We had to 
go after them because the Generals are aggressive, quick and good." 
</P>
<P>
 After Dennis Northcutt returned the opening kickoff 86 yards to the Mules' 
four-yard line, Vestor Ellison kicked a 20-yard field goal.  
</P>
<P>
 The Mules answered in the secnd quarter when Gonzalez guided his team on a 
12-play, 75-yard drive capped by his one-yard quarterback sneak. After 
linebacker Anthony Rodriguez recovered Phillip Scott's fumble at the Mules' 47, 
Gonzalez had a chance to score again, but the Generals defense stiffened and 
time expired in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third quarter, Gonzalez connected with Darryn Pleasants on a 35-yard 
scoring pass. Gonzalez completed six consecutive passes for 82 yards during the 
third quarter, which ended with Wilson leading 14-3. 
</P>
<P>
 After a slow start, Slayton gained 123 of his 157 yards in the second half, 
scoring touchdowns on runs of 27 and 1 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Generals made things interesting when Scott scored on a five-yard run and 
Northcutt added a two-point conversion to make the score 20-11 with 6:44 left 
in the game. LATEEL FRIERSON

 Carson 21, South Gate 13--Few teams get an opportunity to score against Carson 
High's defense. South Gate had seven opportunities, succeeding twice. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams' two touchdowns, however, were not enough. The nine-time City 4-A 
champion Colts won 21-13 Wednesday night in a quarterfinal football game at 
South Gate. 
</P>
<P>
 After scoring on their first two possessions, the Rams had the ball five times 
inside the 25-yard line and failed to score.  
</P>
<P>
 Running back Hoffman Cortes helped the Rams control the clock, rushing for 266 
yards and a touchdown in 30 carries. His 82-yard touchdown run in the first 
quarter gave South Gate a 13-7 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate then drove to the Carson five in 10 plays after Martin Torrea 
recovered a fumble. Quarterback Juan Vasquez's pass bounced in and out of the 
hands of receiver Eddie Montez. Defensive back Jeffrey Waters intercepted the 
pass and Carson stopped the scoring threat. Montez caught a nine-yard pass from 
Vasquez for the Rams' first score. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten plays later, Joseph Redmond, who rushed for 94 yards in 15 carries, scored 
on a four-yard run to cap a 10-play, 80-yard drive, and the Colts took the lead 
for good, 14-13.  
</P>
<P>
 Kicker Raul Aguilar missed field goal attempts of 40 and 28 yards during the 
Rams' next two drives. 
</P>
<P>
 "They played better than we did," South Gate Coach Gary Cordray said. "We had 
our opportunities but we didn't get the ball in (the end zone)." 
</P>
<P>
 Carson, the defending City 4-A champions, qualified for the playoffs despite 
forfeiting three games for using an ineligible player. Carson will play 
top-ranked Sylmar in the semifinals Friday. SEAN WATERS

BOYS' BASKETBALL PREVIEW; TOP 10 PLAYERS TO WATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ronnie Arch 
</P>
<P>
 School: Crenshaw 
</P>
<P>
 Height: 6-6 
</P>
<P>
 Position: Shooting guard 
</P>
<P>
 '93-94 Performance: Arch, who averaged 14 points a game, is the Cougars' 
top-scorer from last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Buzz for '94-'95: Arch succeeds Reggie McFerren as Crenshaw's designated 
three-point specialist. Arch is an excellent spot-up shooter, but must improve 
scoring off the dribble. He will need to contribute 18-20 points a game to help 
soothe the loss of McFerren, Tremaine Fowlkes and Kris Johnson -- the area's 
top-scoring trio last season. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan Bailey 
</P>
<P>
 School: Loyola 
</P>
<P>
 Height: 6-1 
</P>
<P>
 Position: Point guard 
</P>
<P>
 '93-94 Performance: Bailey was second in scoring for Loyola at 16 points a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Buzz for '94-'95: This year will be Bailey's coming-out party after playing in 
the shadow of older brother Toby. Loyola has reason to be excited about the 
ever-improving Bailey, who scored a team-high 20 points in the Cubs' loss to 
Mater Dei in last year's Southern Section Division I-A semifinals. Look for 
Bailey to average in the mid-20s as he will have to carry much of the offensive 
load. He recently received a scholarship to Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Clem Breedlove 
</P>
<P>
 School: Jordan 
</P>
<P>
 Height: 5-10 
</P>
<P>
 Position: Shooting guard 
</P>
<P>
 '93-94 Performance: Breedlove led the Bulldogs in scoring at 20 points a game 
and was selected to the All-Southeastern Conference Team. 
</P>
<P>
 Buzz for '94-'95: Breedlove is a very streaky shooter but a consistent scorer. 
He should easily lead the area in three-pointers attempted and will be among 
the top in three-pointers made. Breedlove has had trouble defending bigger 
guards, but his defense has improved. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Darwin Carter 
</P>
<P>
 School: Manual Arts 
</P>
<P>
 Height: 6-0 
</P>
<P>
 Position: Point guard 
</P>
<P>
 '93-94 Performance: Carter led the team in three-pointers made and was second 
in scoring at 16.4 points a game. 
</P>
<P>
 Buzz for '94-'95: Carter combines a good outside shot with extreme quickness. 
He is a good perimeter defender and is the strongest player on the team. Carter 
needs to improve his dribble penetration and must look to create for his 
teammates.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Howzell 
</P>
<P>
 School: Dorsey 
</P>
<P>
 Height: 6-3 
</P>
<P>
 Position: Shooting guard 
</P>
<P>
 '93-94 Performance: Howzell averaged 12 points a game on a Dorsey team that 
spread the wealth on offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Buzz for '94-'95: Howzell will be a focal point of Dorsey's perimeter game. He 
is the team's best three-point shooter and perhaps its best scorer. Howzell 
needs to look for better quality shots. Has good height for his position but a 
thin frame may result in fatigue after three quarters of physical play. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Gordon-Lamar 
</P>
<P>
 School: Washington 
</P>
<P>
 Height: 6-6 
</P>
<P>
 Position: Small/power forward 
</P>
<P>
 '93-94 Performance: Gordon-Lamar averaged nine points and nine rebounds a game 
during an up-and-down season. 
</P>
<P>
 Buzz for '94-'95: Gordon-Lamar has good range on the jump shot and solid 
rebounding skills, which make him interchangeable at scoring or power forward. 
Needs to increase aggressiveness and intensity at both ends to become a great 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Palmer 
</P>
<P>
 School: Crenshaw 
</P>
<P>
 Height: 6-7 
</P>
<P>
 Position: Small forward 
</P>
<P>
 '93-94 Performance: Palmer averaged 10 points a game as member of Crenshaw's 
second unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Buzz for '94-'95: Palmer returns from last year's championship team and will 
be expected to provide offensive leadership. Like Arch, Palmer's specialty is 
the three-pointer but he needs to improve consistency from other areas of the 
floor. Despite a lanky frame, Palmer is a valuable asset at 6-7 because he can 
defend the shooting guard, small forward and some power forwards.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Travis Reed 
</P>
<P>
 School: Manual Arts 
</P>
<P>
 Height: 6-7 
</P>
<P>
 Position: Power forward 
</P>
<P>
 '93-94 Performance: Reed was a formidable backup to Tremaine Fowlkes, 
averaging 14 points a game as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 Buzz for '94-'95: Despite the probability of seeing quality minutes in the 
post with two-time defending State champion Crenshaw, Reed chose to take his 
act to Manual Arts. He will help fill the void created by David Rickenbacker's 
with good post moves, surprising ballhandling skills and good speed filling the 
lane. A consistent jump shot will help round out his game.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dony Wilcher 
</P>
<P>
 School: Fremont 
</P>
<P>
 Height: 5-10 
</P>
<P>
 Position: Point guard 
</P>
<P>
 '93-94 Performance: Wilcher led the team in assists and formed one of the 
area's best backcourts alongside Calvin Patterson.  
</P>
<P>
 Buzz for '94-'95: Wilcher is a fiery player with a flashy game to match. 
Wilcher can bring a crowd to its feet with a spectacular no-look pass or throw 
the ball away leading a three-on-one fastbreak. At 5-10, Wilcher makes up for 
lack of size with quick hands and good defensive awareness. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Deon Williams 
</P>
<P>
 School: Verbum Dei 
</P>
<P>
 Height: 6-1 
</P>
<P>
 Position: Point guard 
</P>
<P>
 '93-94 Performance: Williams averaged 11 points a game in a back-up role to 
Jamal Cobbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Buzz for '94-'95: Williams is a very good ballhandler who distributes the ball 
well among his scorers. Williams will need to consistently hit the 18-foot jump 
shot to keep opponents from doubling-down on Verbum Dei's talented post 
players.

 As Teresa Radlinska was rolled into Operating Room 3 on the day before 
Thanksgiving, she knew that a robot would be part of the medical team removing 
her gall bladder. 
</P>
<P>
 But she didn't worry about a non-human assistant probing around inside her 
body, because its precise maneuvers meant she would be out of surgery in only 
25 minutes and home in time for Thanksgiving dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 The new doctors' assistant at Verdugo Hills Hospital in Glendale is a large 
robotic arm called AESOP and used during laparoscopic surgeries, which include 
gall bladder, hernia, gynecological and intestinal operations. In these types 
of surgeries, a long, minute camera called a laparoscope is inserted into the 
body and sends pictures to nearby television screens to guide the doctor 
through surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Verdugo Hills is one of two hospitals in Southern California -- and the first 
in the San Fernando Valley -- to use the robotic arm, which can more steadily 
guide the laparoscope than a human assistant, surgeons at the hospital said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Verdugo Hills said AESOP, which stands for Automated Endoscopic 
System for Optimal Positioning, is better for patients -- recovery is quicker 
and operating time is reduced. By eliminating the need for assistants to hold 
the laparoscope, they are free to tend to other patient needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest benefit is that it frees up a set of hands and it holds (the 
laparoscope) still when you want it to hold still," said Dr. Steve Gossard, a 
general surgeon at Verdugo Hills who removed Radlinska's gall bladder. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the robot's help, the 45-year-old Radlinska would have been in surgery 
for several hours instead of less than half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 With a hand-held remote control, Gossard guided AESOP's movement of the 
laparoscope through Radlinska's abdominal cavity until it reached her gall 
bladder. The mini video camera, which was inserted through an incision under 
her bellybutton, provided him with clear images on the monitors next to the 
operating table. 
</P>
<P>
 Gossard also used the remote control to program the robotic arm to memorize 
positions near Radlinska's gall bladder in case he needed to go back to them. 
</P>
<P>
 AESOP is an improvement over human hands because it can hold the camera 
perfectly steady for an extended period of time. When humans do the same job, 
the picture shakes, somewhat like an amateur cameraman's home video, making it 
extremely difficult for surgeons to pinpoint the surgical areas. 
</P>
<P>
 With both of his hands free, surgical assistant Dr. Bob Pereyra used other 
instruments to maneuver Radlinska's liver and gall bladder so that Gossard 
could complete the surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's (free to work) the gall bladder around in the positions I need it to 
be," said Gossard during the closing minutes of the surgery. As he pulled out 
Radlinska's gall bladder, he squeezed the inch-and-a-half-long sack to confirm 
that it was filled with gallstones. "It's full of multiple stones . . . a whole 
bunch of them," Gossard said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, either Gossard or Pereyra would have had to use one of their 
hands to move the laparoscope and the other to maneuver Radlinska's organs. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's just not enough room around the operating table to get in all the 
hands you need," said Dr. Ronald Woodard, a gynecologist who was the first at 
Verdugo Hills to use AESOP. 
</P>
<P>
 The company that created AESOP, Goleta-based Computer Motion, is the only firm 
in the United States that has received Food and Drug Administration approval to 
market this technology. UC San Diego Medical Center was the first hospital to 
begin using AESOP. The company is also developing a voice-activated AESOP that 
surgeons will be able to command by saying, "AESOP right" or "AESOP down." 
</P>
<P>
 AESOP, however, is not the first use of a robot in surgery. Doctors at UC 
Davis Medical Center in Sacramento have been using a robot called Robodoc for 
the past two years to drill holes in hips for replacement operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors at Verdugo Hills said patients have expressed confidence about a robot 
being part of their operations. "The consumer is very technology-conscious," 
said Casey Barbiera, director of surgery at Verdugo Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Gossard said there are no known risks in using the arm, which the hospital 
rents for $595 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the laparoscope, doctors removed gall bladders through a four-inch 
incision that was made under the rib cage. This left patients with large scars 
that took as long as six weeks to heal. "(Now patients) are home in a day, and 
they return to work within a week at most," Barbiera said. 
</P>
<P>
 Radlinska left Verdugo Hills with four Band-Aid-size incisions that would heal 
in no time. She will still be able to wear a bathing suit, with no embarrassing 
marks, Barbiera said.

STILL IN THE SWIM; RECREATION: RAE TERRAN CONQUERED HER FEAR OF THE WATER LATE 
IN LIFE. AT 94, SHE STILL TEACHES A CLASS IN THE BURBANK YMCA POOL. 
</P>

 Swimming suits Rae Terran. It has ever since she learned how, and that was 
when she was 67. 
</P>
<P>
 In a couple of weeks, she'll be 95. 
</P>
<P>
 She's still in the pool, still teaching an exercise class twice a week at the 
YMCA of Burbank, just as she has ever since she learned to do laps. All those 
years, and always as a volunteer -- a commitment so extraordinary that it 
serves as testament to one person's faith in others, the notion of community 
and the determination to conquer one's worst fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Way back when, when I learned to swim, I promised myself, I said, if I take 
this fear out of me, I'm going to spend the rest of my life taking that fear 
out of other people," Terran said. 
</P>
<P>
 For a quarter of a century, she has been doing just that -- and impressing the 
people she meets with her selflessness and energy.  
</P>
<P>
 "Good heavens," said a longtime friend, Margot Young of Burbank, "how many 
people do you know who have been volunteering for 25 years? And who dunk 
themselves twice a week to help other people? I just have such great respect 
for her. And she's a dear to go with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Added R. Glenn Ford, 74, of Burbank, who has been a regular in the Tuesday and 
Thursday "aquasize" class for the past two years: "What's unusual is that in 
this day and age, everybody who does something expects something back. She does 
it because she enjoys it." 
</P>
<P>
 "She's one of those people you want to clone," said Karen Layo, who supervises 
pool and gymnastics programs at the YMCA. Plans are under way, she said, for a 
big party on Terran's birthday, Dec. 16. "Cake, of course. And we'll blow up 
balloons and throw them in the pool for her." 
</P>
<P>
 These, Terran said, are sentiments that money can't buy. And that's why she 
has never asked the YMCA to pay her. "From time to time," she said, "I've had 
to say to them that I didn't come here for that. I came here to volunteer." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, she said, she started going to the YMCA in the late '60s -- when she 
was in her late 60s -- because, frankly, she was out to do something for 
herself. 
</P>
<P>
 She had a happy marriage. She and her husband, Al, who worked in the 
construction business, had a home in Burbank. There were four children.  
</P>
<P>
 But she felt she had missed out -- on the cold, crisp rivers and lakes in her 
native New York, then the ocean when she and her husband had moved west. She 
had always loved to play outside, especially with the children -- but she was 
terrified of water. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't even take a bath in a full tub of water," Terran said. "You know 
how people love to submerge in a tub full of warm water, just relax? I couldn't 
do it. I was afraid I'd suffocate. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what pushed me to learn to swim. I said, I'm either going to learn or 
I'm going to sink. Then I thought, if I sink, someone will pick me up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, I haven't sunk and I'm still here." 
</P>
<P>
 Once in the swim of things, Terran opted to volunteer to teach others her 
newfound skills. And she took on leadership of the "aquasize" class, designed 
especially for senior citizens or others who want exercise -- or who are under 
doctor's orders to work out -- but need a warm pool to cushion the stress of 
exertion. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as she did back in the '60s, Terran takes the bus to the pool. And as 
always, someone in the class volunteers to drive her home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still enjoy it as much as I did 10 years ago, 15 years ago, and so on," 
Terran said. "The people are so nice, so friendly, so beautiful. I've seen so 
many beautiful, friendly people coming in and out of that Y that you could cry 
sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Terran has refined the workout. The 1994 version, delivered 
Tuesday and Thursday afternoons, is thorough. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do exercises all over our body," she said. "There is not one inch that 
isn't exercised. Neck, arms, legs. Even our eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the hourlong session -- which used to be run to rock and roll but now 
features the sounds of the Big Band era, supplied by Ford -- concludes with 
exercises for the eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You keep your head steady ahead," Terran tells the class. "Don't move your 
head. You look up, down, side to side and so on." 
</P>
<P>
 She's living proof, she reminds her pupils, that exercise is good for the body 
-- and the soul. "What do most senior citizens do? Sit around and play cards. 
They don't get any exercise and the bones get brittle. This is not good." 
</P>
<P>
 Better, she said, that they should jump in the pool -- like her. Said another 
class regular, Lori Crawford, 68, of Burbank: "I always say, 'Rae, stick your 
foot in -- if it's cold, we're going to get a heart attack.' She never does 
that. She always jumps right in. Boom!" 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, however, this can't go on forever. And going on 95, Terran said, 
she's given a fair amount of thought to that eventuality. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say to me, 'Are you still teaching exercise?' And I say, 'Yes.' And 
they say, 'Are you going to teach it until you die?' 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what my answer is? My answer is, yes, I will. They'll pick me up and 
I'll be all clean, all warm, in the nice clean water. There's no better place."

OXNARD OFFICE SHOOTING HAUNTS SURVIVORS NEARLY 1 YEAR LATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ALVAREZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Those who were wounded physically and emotionally by a gunman's deadly rampage 
at an Oxnard jobs office are still struggling with their sorrow a year later. 
</P>
<P>
 And those who were told that worker safety would be paramount after the 
shootings are struggling with their anger. 
</P>
<P>
 Karen Villegas is among those still dealing with her sorrow. Her husband, 
Phillip, was the first person shot and the first killed. She says it seems like 
yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not a day goes by that I don't relive it," she says, her voice heavy with 
anguish. "I still expect him to come through the door. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear a noise in the house and I think it's him in another room. I still set 
a place at the table for him sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Pat McConahay, spokeswoman for the union representing the Employment 
Development Department workers, is among those dealing with her anger. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only have state officials broken an early promise to quickly relocate the 
employees to another office, McConahay says, but now they are considering 
replacing an armed guard at the Oxnard EDD office with an unarmed guard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are we going to have to see some more bodies on the floors of these offices 
before some real action takes place?" she asked. "I guess what this tells us is 
that the bottom line is always money first, instead of lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a year has passed since the bloodiest shooting spree in Ventura County 
history left five people dead and four wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 On Dec. 2, unemployed computer engineer Alan Winterbourne burst into the state 
jobs office in Oxnard and gunned down Villegas, co-worker Anna Velasco and 
Richard Bateman, a rehabilitation counselor with the Assn. for Retarded 
Citizens visiting the office that day. 
</P>
<P>
 He later shot and killed Oxnard Detective James O'Brien before being shot dead 
in a hail of police gunfire outside another jobs office in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire episode, from first shot to last, lasted about 13 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 But really, it lives on. 
</P>
<P>
 The rampage ripped the fabric of the community, damaging a suburban notion 
that mass murders only happen in other places and to other people. 
</P>
<P>
 It brought to light the issue of workers' safety and the rising frustrations 
of those who scour a shrinking job market in search of steady employment. 
</P>
<P>
 It made people feel more vulnerable and less safe. It was a horror many could 
not cope with, let alone begin to understand. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened on Dec. 2 deeply wounded our community," said Ventura County 
Supervisor John Flynn, whose district includes Oxnard. "We read and we listen 
to so much news about shootings and killings today, and sometimes we think they 
can only happen elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "But this happened in our own community. It got our attention in a hurry." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the one-year anniversary days away, those sentiments are again being 
stirred to the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Oxnard officials named a softball field after O'Brien. And Friday's 
anniversary observances of the Dec. 2 rampage will be filled with a daylong 
series of events, including a ceremony at a commemorative rose garden, planted 
to honor the dead, at the Ventura County Government Center. 
</P>
<P>
 But many of those closest to the incident are not ready to take part in 
anniversary memorials. Some have even left town to avoid the crush of public 
attention that is sure to come Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Wendy Di Rodio, a licensed marriage and family psychotherapist in Ventura, 
said feelings of fear and anxiety are normal and expected as the anniversary 
approaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those feelings do not indicate that people have not grown or made a lot of 
progress," said Di Rodio, who was called in by the state to help employees and 
clients work through the incident. "It shows how important it is that these 
people have developed positive methods of dealing with this trauma because it 
has become part of their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 As the day draws near, those who will take part in the public remembrances are 
bracing for the inevitability of reliving the events of a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to build myself up. I'm trying to be brave," said Pat O'Brien, 
mother of the slain Oxnard police detective. "I know we'll all make it, but 
there will be a few tears." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Added Villegas: "I wish I could go to sleep and just wake up after it was all 
over. As it gets closer and closer to the anniversary, it's just a terrible 
feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 For employees at Oxnard's state unemployment office, the first anniversary 
will be spent where the rampage took place. Despite an early promise to 
relocate the office, state officials now say the move won't take place until at 
least March. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard office will move from its current location at 1960 N. C St. to a 
vacant grocery store at 5th Street and Ventura Road.  
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, security has been beefed up at the current site. 
</P>
<P>
 Bullet-resistant glass has been erected across a long wooden counter that had 
no barrier before. Full walls have replaced waist-high partitions that used to 
separate clients from employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Office doors, including the gate that Winterbourne kicked open when he started 
shooting, have been replaced and reinforced with steel. An armed guard now 
stands watch in the lobby. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before the shootings, employees had complained about a lack of security 
at the Oxnard office. Some said they even feared for their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 For many of the office workers, the desire to feel safe in the workplace 
suffered a setback recently when EDD officials proposed replacing the armed 
guard with an unarmed guard. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Angered by the proposal, employees fired off a letter to management in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hate to think that the shooting at our office is just old news now that 
nine months have passed," read an excerpt of the letter published this month in 
a union newsletter. "It is both to your benefit and ours to help prevent 
setbacks, which in this case involves providing us with an armed guard 
indefinitely, as promised." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, officials agreed to keep the armed guard in place for now. But 
EDD spokeswoman Suzanne Schroeder said that could change when the office moves 
to its new location. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will depend on whether or not the situation requires it," she said. "If 
it's determined that the (armed) guard is still needed, then the status will 
not change." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, leaders of the state workers union that represents the office's 
employees are outraged that the proposal remains under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still feel that the state, our employer, is not taking this very 
seriously," said McConahay, spokeswoman for the California State Employees 
Assn. "I think this incident shows that these tragedies can happen anywhere and 
everywhere, even in suburbia." 
</P>
<P>
 Also at issue is the mental health of the state employees who have had to 
return to an office where they witnessed their co-workers, their friends, 
gunned down in cold blood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Violence in the workplace happens without warning and removes all sense of 
control," said Di Rodio, who is writing a book titled "Workplace Violence: The 
Trauma and the Healing of EDD 073." 
</P>
<P>
 "Similar to a bank robbery, there is a fear of being shot. However, a holdup 
man enters with the aim of taking money; here the gunman entered with the aim 
of taking lives," Di Rodio said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Winterbourne opened fire Dec. 2, his aim was deadly. 
</P>
<P>
 It started at 11:41 a.m., when the 33-year-old unemployed man walked into the 
jobs office and indiscriminately began spraying it with bullets. Survivors 
remember the silence. They remember hiding under desks and hearing Winterbourne 
stalk through the office, hunting for victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Irma Lopez, the wife of Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez, remembers making a break 
for safety only to be cut down just short of the front door. She remembers 
lying on the ground, wounded and bleeding and unable to move. 
</P>
<P>
 And she remembers being dragged to safety by a stranger as the gunman 
continued to fire at her. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking back now, I can hardly believe that it happened," said Lopez, who 
continues to battle bouts of severe sciatic nerve pain from where shotgun 
pellets ripped into her back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know of course that it happened. I can see my physical scarring. I know 
that my friends are gone. But still, it's hard to even come to grips with the 
idea that somebody tried to kill me." 
</P>
<P>
 Three other employees also were wounded -- Darlene Provencio of Oxnard, 
Catherine Stinson of Port Hueneme and Bonnie Smith of Camarillo. Of the 
wounded, only Smith has returned to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees say the carnage could have been much worse. About a dozen of the 35 
employees had called in sick that day. More were out of the office for various 
reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "So much has changed," said office manager Avelina Villalobos, losing a battle 
to keep from crying. "We've all changed to an extent. None of us will ever be 
the same again." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred less than a month after Phillip and Karen Villegas 
celebrated their 25th wedding anniversary. They met in high school. She was a 
freshman, he a sophomore with a driver's license and a '54 Chevy. 
</P>
<P>
 They went to football games and high school dances. He would pick her up after 
school each day even after he graduated. They were married in the fall, a few 
months after her graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really were a perfect match," she said. "We just grew together; we did not 
grow apart. We were lucky. We were very lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, Villegas has tried to learn how to get along without her 
high school sweetheart. Her children -- Phillip, 25, and Lisa, 22 -- have tried 
to get along without their father. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no words to describe the private hell that we've gone through," she 
said. "I just feel so cheated. They say it gets easier. I'm waiting." 
</P>
<P>
 So, too, is Pat O'Brien. 
</P>
<P>
 Against a steady rain Friday morning, O'Brien tended the grave of her son, the 
Oxnard policeman gunned down in the line of duty. She was joined by other 
family members, including her son Tom, who visited his brother's grave site for 
the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to wait until the headstone was in place," he explained. The grave 
marker was installed last week. It is engraved with a police badge with the 
number 140, O'Brien's number. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The marker reads in part: "A cop's cop." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a real busy guy. It was almost like he had a schedule to keep," his 
mother said. "He left this world in a blaze of glory." 
</P>
<P>
 The cemetery will be filled next week, when Oxnard police hold a memorial on 
the anniversary of O'Brien's death. Similar ceremonies will be held for other 
victims of the massacre. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just part of the remembering, which is good for everybody," Tom O'Brien 
said of the string of memorials planned for next Friday. "It helps with the 
healing." 
</P>
<P>
 There will be no graveside memorial for Alan Winterbourne. He was cremated and 
his ashes were scattered at sea off the Santa Barbara coast.

NIGHT HOWLS; EVEN WITH LITTLE CASH AND NO WHEELS, KIDS FIND PLENTY TO DO ON A 
FRIDAY EVENING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Come nightfall in Ventura County, teen-agers drift into that awkward, 
cash-poor limbo between living at home and leaving home: Hanging out. 
</P>
<P>
 Clustering at football games, video arcades and shopping malls from Ventura to 
Simi Valley, they wolf junk food, share gossip and ogle the opposite sex. 
</P>
<P>
 And all across the county, they complain: "I'm so bored, there's nothing to do 
in this town!" 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, youth counselors say, Ventura County has plenty of things for teen-agers 
to do. Hanging out is a way of searching for purpose in life, a crowd to fit in 
with, a niche in the grown-up world. 
</P>
<P>
 And the universal teen-age gripe, they say, is just part of that search. 
</P>
<P>
 " There's nothing to do. They've been saying that for years and years and 
years," said Toni Garubo, a guidance counselor at Adolfo Camarillo High School. 
"It doesn't seem to matter whether there really is anything to do. For the 
person who complains, they usually wouldn't do anything even if you gave them a 
list." 
</P>
<P>
 All people -- particularly teen-agers -- yearn for a sense of belonging, said 
Carol Walker, a Westlake Village family therapist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids that age like a lot of excitement and a lot of adventure, and wherever 
kids are, they often feel it's kind of boring," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents worry that kids hang out to use drugs, and sometimes they do. . . 
.But it's a very natural, developmental thing for teen-agers to want to hang 
out and just talk." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, with little money, no wheels and no particular place to go on a 
Friday night, Ventura County's teen-agers find plenty to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Girls cruise The Oaks mall to check out the latest fashions and eye cute boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Boys pound on glaring, booming video games in Ventura, straining to beat each 
other's high scores. 
</P>
<P>
 Self-described weirdos preen and thrash in the glorious noise of a punk band 
in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-age couples in most towns park somewhere dark and neck. 
</P>
<P>
 And outside an Oxnard Taco Bell, high schoolers shiver at the cold and wonder 
whether anyone's throwing a party tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Most teen-agers' formula for a good time is open-ended, but precise: 
</P>
<P>
 "What we look for is a . . . place where your parents can't see you and you 
can smoke," said Jane Johnson, 16, a Westlake High junior dragging on a 
cigarette outside the Vampyre Lounge Cafe in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look for a place with no parents, where nothing bad happens and there's no 
little gang bangers." 
</P>
<P>
 By most accounts, the Vampyre is just such a place. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Owners and patrons say that some Simi Valley preachers condemn the Vampyre as 
a temple of sin where Satan worshipers offer animal sacrifices to the devil. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it is only a coffeehouse in a strip mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Simi Valley beat cops say it is safe and its young patrons are mostly 
well-behaved. And by 9 p.m. most Fridays -- like this night -- it is packed 
with kids and thumping with music. 
</P>
<P>
 "THERE WAS A BOY," wails the lead singer for Sienna, throttling power chords 
out of a beaten Gibson Les Paul. "HE FELL IN LOVE WITH THE TELEVISION." 
</P>
<P>
 One shaggy boy in baggy overalls jogs furiously in place, flailing his head 
and fists to the beat. Another, 15 feet from the shattering noise of the drums, 
dozes in an armchair. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers in heavy makeup and offbeat threads lounge in battered armchairs, 
nodding in rhythm and occasionally shouting comments to each other. 
</P>
<P>
 A $4 cover fee buys thrash, ska, speedcore and blues music from two live bands 
on many weekend nights, and the privilege of getting a little wild without 
grown-ups jumping down their throats. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, draped on cars and curbs, kids smoke, roughhouse and gossip. 
</P>
<P>
 Two girls slap playfully at each other's faces, giggling. 
</P>
<P>
 A boy smashes a disposable lighter to the sidewalk, where it explodes with a 
bang. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey!" shouts 18-year-old John Buettgen, a wiry, goateed bouncer with serious 
eyes. "You do that? You're not coming back in! A piece of shrapnel from that 
could go in someone's eye." 
</P>
<P>
 The offender slinks back to the curb, snickering, and Buettgen sums up the 
Vampyre's appeal: It is the only cheap, "cool" hangout in town. 
</P>
<P>
 "For anybody between the ages of 14 and 18, there's nothing to do," Buettgen 
says. "First of all, the majority of them don't have jobs. . . .Most of the 
jobs out there for people under 18 are, like, flipping burgers. Second, there 
aren't that many places at night for them to go to." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Vampyre teen-agers pride themselves on being mostly sober and 
self-governing. 
</P>
<P>
 'We're off the streets, we're not doing major crimes," huffs Bree Lindberg, 
15, a Simi Valley High sophomore. "At school if you dress strange like this, 
people stare at you. You come here and you get accepted for being weird." 
</P>
<P>
 Everybody else, they say, is off playing pool or bowling or -- uncoolest of 
all -- yelling their lungs out at a football game and getting wasted at 
post-game parties. 
</P>
<P>
 But the games draw huge numbers of Ventura County teen-agers on autumn Friday 
nights, and many fans never miss a game. 
</P>
<P>
 One such night, cheerleaders chant and fans scream as Ventura High stomps 
Santa Barbara Dons in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stick 'em, baby!" a fan bellows at the teams. "Let's go, Duane, let's stick 
these pansies!" 
</P>
<P>
 Leaning back on their elbows, three 15-year-old Ventura High School sophomores 
scope out their boys in black. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's some pretty rad guys on this team, and you can quote me," says Sandra 
Link with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eric Olsen's really rad, he's the quarterback," offers Melissa Hall. "We've 
got a lot of hotties on our team." 
</P>
<P>
 "One of them likes my very good friend Sarah," confides Nicole Little. "I'm 
waiting for him to notice me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura Cougars muscle the ball downfield on a strong running play, and 
the home crowd erupts in cheers, but the girls keep kibitzing. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Rita Dunn says she hangs out at the football games because "Ventura 
sucks. There's nothing better to do here. 
</P>
<P>
 "But then I've lived here all my life, so I'm burnt out," adds Rita, 17, 
gobbling a chicken sandwich. "You can't go anywhere because there's this gang 
that goes everywhere and ruins everything. They come and start fights and steal 
things and vandalize -- but other than that, the people in Ventura are all 
really nice." 
</P>
<P>
 Many Ventura County teen-agers structure their weekend nights to avoid gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some retreat to brightly lighted, adult-run refuges such as the Colonia Gym 
and the Thousand Oaks Teen Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing 21 on the Teen Center's basketball court, two boys taunt a buddy with 
a lesson about fat from a despised biology teacher, shouting "Lipid! Lipid! 
Lipid!" as they charge in for a layup. 
</P>
<P>
 Three younger boys shoot pool and argue about rap music while MTV blares from 
the stereo big-screen TV in the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen more debate the powers of demons and wizards, losing themselves in the 
arcane fantasy world of a sword-and-sorcery card game called Magic: The 
Gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 And hundreds find peace in the malls. 
</P>
<P>
 Drive-by shootings and gang violence make Saticoy's streets "too crazy" to 
hang out on at night, says Junior Burciaga, 14, and older boys shoo him away. 
</P>
<P>
 On Halloween "the big guys told us to go home, man," he says. "They told us to 
go home because we'd get blasted." Sure enough, the three heard gunshots later 
that night, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So, Junior and his Buena High schoolmates, Miguel Lopez, 15, and Joel Ramirez, 
14, cruise the Esplanade mall in Oxnard, checking out clothes and hoping to 
snag phone numbers from girls they meet. 
</P>
<P>
 They are also, he admits a little sheepishly, killing time until they can get 
a ride home from Junior's sister. 
</P>
<P>
 She walks by, but they ignore her coolly and lope off to flip through the 
latest rap CDs. 
</P>
<P>
 Four other teen-agers pore over a jeweler's gems, passing time before hitting 
the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They reminisce about raves -- late-night, drug-free underground parties they 
have attended in warehouses and hastily rented fraternal organization halls. 
</P>
<P>
 And they grouse about their parents' lectures on Oxnard's curfew law -- no one 
under 18 is allowed on the streets without purpose between 10 p.m. and 6 a.m.. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tonight, they'd only let me go out because they know who's taking me," says 
Tina Perlingos, 16, of Port Hueneme. "My mother's like, 'Call me at 6, call me 
at 7, call me at 8 and let me know where you're going.' " 
</P>
<P>
 She adds wistfully, "If we were old enough, we'd go to The Dome, it's this 
club near Hollywood. I'm going to be 17. I'd love to be a year older."  
</P>
<P>
 Still, it has been a fun -- if expensive -- night out. They will end it 
watching a long-awaited show of "Interview With the Vampire." 
</P>
<P>
 And they began it by lurking in the fake fog, eerie light and throbbing techno 
music of a new sci-fi battle parlor in Oxnard, sniping at each other with laser 
rifles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lazerstar's probably going to be the new trend," Jausch Galloway, 17, says 
about his new-found obsession. "Lazerstar is it. If you talk to anyone who 
hangs out at Golf N' Stuff, they're losers." 
</P>
<P>
 Losers or not, teen-agers pack the Ventura amusement center on Friday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Amateur golfers goof their way around Golf N' Stuff's tiny plastic putting 
greens, shooting dimpled balls past windmills and other absurd obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
 Amateur drivers in sputtering go-carts tear through the chicanes and 
switchbacks of a miniature Indy speedway. They bounce their fiberglass cars off 
walls and each other, laughing giddily in the November chill. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun, it's a safe place to go, and there's no violence or drug activity," 
said Tricia O'Neill, 16, a Buena High junior, straightening her hair after a 
wild, 17-m.p.h. race in a seat three inches above the track. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Classmate Colin Gallagher, 16, stabs a finger at two drivers who jammed him 
into the wall in the last race, and swears revenge: "Those two guys, I'm going 
to GET 'EM!" 
</P>
<P>
 Out on the sidewalk, a girl pouts to a friend about a lover's spat: "So he's 
all, 'Well give it to me,' and I'm all, 'You think you're such hot crap!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, Buena High's Nate Saylor, 17, and Alex Dennis, 18, slug it out at the 
controls of Primal Rage, each trying to kill the other's video alter ego -- a 
snarling prehistoric giant. 
</P>
<P>
 Nate's monster stomps Alex's into the turf, then battles the game computer's 
monster with hammerlike fists and greenish clouds of toxic flatulence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Strike a pose, Nate, strike a pose!" Alex urges. Alex's girlfriend Jennifer 
Hutton, 17, hugs him close. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Alex and Jennifer lean together against a vacant pinball machine, 
nuzzling amid the video room's electronic thunder and the smell of snack bar 
fries. 
</P>
<P>
 Up at Grant Park, parked cars line the road with more serious nuzzling going 
on behind their steamed windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Misti Guilford, 17, and Jay Badaracco, 18, of Ojai, pull up in his pickup 
truck. Oil rig lights glow offshore. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing to do in Ojai," says Misti. "Usually we go to football games, 
but tonight we went to a car show at Hudson's Grill." 
</P>
<P>
 Some come to drink beer or smoke marijuana while gazing out over all of 
Ventura and the Santa Barbara Channel. 
</P>
<P>
 But Misti and Jay have come with a blanket in the truck, they admit candidly, 
to make out. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, a Honda stops and two girls get out. One stumbles over to a stone wall 
and vomits. Without a word, they hop back in and drive away. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan Gross, 17, and John Redding, 15, pull up from Santa Paula and park their 
white pickup facing Ventura Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 They ease onto the hood, light cigarettes and stare down at the glittering 
field of street lights stretching away into the dark Ojai Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing to do," Bryan says quietly after awhile. "Nothing to do 
except for cruising around." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there is little to do in smaller cities such as Fillmore and Santa 
Paula other than hang out at fast-food joints or house parties, said Fillmore 
High guidance counselor Joe Torres. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hear a lot about partying, drinking and use of drugs," Torres said. "We do 
have a lot of kids who just don't have access to cars, and they just stay 
around town . . . doing with what they have in front of them. And lots of times 
it's booze." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who can muster the gas money drive into Ventura or Oxnard to the malls, 
the all-ages clubs -- anywhere they can get out of the house and hang out with 
their friends for a few hours, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main things kids want," said therapist Carol Walker, "is to be with their 
peers, and to be liked by their peers. And they're also looking to figure out, 
'Who am I?' "

FOOD BANK SUPPLIES DOWN BUT NEED IS UP; HUNGER: THE CHARITIES ARE SCRAMBLING TO 
MAKE ENDS MEET AMID REDUCTIONS IN PRIVATE DONATIONS AND FEDERAL SURPLUS ITEMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Cuts in aid, a rise in hunger and even the Mediterranean fruit fly have left 
Ventura County food banks grappling this holiday season with more mouths to 
feed and less food to fill them. 
</P>
<P>
 Food Share, Ventura County's massive food bank network, is scraping for 
donations at a time when donors' generosity usually peaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're presently struggling to meet the requests from our agencies," said Jim 
Mangis, executive director of the Oxnard-based collective. "We are entering the 
holiday season with a lot less food than we normally have." 
</P>
<P>
 Food Share delivers fresh, frozen and canned food to its 257 member agencies 
every month. In turn, the agencies feed more than 100,000 people countywide -- 
53% of whom are children. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're seeing is an increase in families that need it, an increase in 
people who never thought they'd need assistance with food," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Ventura County's new needy have been laid off recently. There are 
others who simply cannot make ends meet: 
</P>
<P>
 * Elderly people who live on Social Security benefits of only $300 to $600 per 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 * Single parents who skimp on food to pay for child care so they can be free 
to work. 
</P>
<P>
 * Two-parent families in which one or both adults are laid off or working for 
substandard wages. 
</P>
<P>
 And at the same time, Mangis said, widespread cuts in the supply of food to 
Food Share have conspired to shrink its stores by 20%: 
</P>
<P>
 * Federal budget cuts have lopped off 75% of the supply of surplus food from 
the U. S. Department of Agriculture that Food Share once relied on for 17% of 
its supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Medfly scare in Camarillo's citrus groves cut off a steady supply of 
oranges and other fruit that Food Share's volunteer gleaners once brought in 
for the hungry, Mangis said. 
</P>
<P>
 * And private food drives, corporate food donations and contributions from the 
public -- whose gifts of a few cans or a single bag of groceries usually help 
propel the food banks through the heavy holiday demand -- are scarcer this year 
than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 The cut in U. S. surplus food was devastating to agencies that relied on it, 
such as Food Share. 
</P>
<P>
 "It means that last year, we received around 2 million pounds of food -- rice, 
beans, butter, corn meal, flour, peanut butter, canned fruits, canned pork, 
powdered milk," Mangis said. "This year we probably won't get more than 500,000 
pounds. . . . It's part of trying to balance the (federal) budget, and 
unfortunately, poor and hungry people don't have a lot of clout." 
</P>
<P>
 But the decline in public and private donations also has hurt, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real key is local involvement when we get into this time of year -- all 
the food drives," Mangis said. "We're below where we have been. We're presently 
struggling to meet the requests from our agencies." 
</P>
<P>
 The countywide food squeeze has rippled down to pinch smaller outlets such as 
St. John's Community Outreach, which feeds Oxnard's needy La Colonia 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The St. John's food pantry gathered just enough food from Food Share and other 
donors to put together 150 Thanksgiving food baskets for poor families in the 
last week, said its operator, Sister Carmen Rodriguez. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Outreach pantry will have to refill its shelves for the coming months 
-- and for Christmas meals -- from Food Share's already strapped larder, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I keep thinking, 'God will provide, God will provide,' " Sister Carmen said. 
"But I still worry. It hasn't been as full this year as it has in the past 
couple years." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura, Project Understanding has been giving out only 10% of the surplus 
USDA food that it used to distribute, said Jeanine Faria, who runs the homeless 
aid agency's food pantry. That puts more of a demand on individual donors to 
help, she said. "And right now, people aren't rushing to give any food. You 
know what I mean?" 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Thanksgiving rolled around last year, five volunteer groups had 
held food drives or promised to hold them for Project Understanding's holiday 
needs, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As of last week, Faria said, none had volunteered. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got 6,000 people on our database that have received food here over the 
last 2 1/2 years," Faria said. "With that kind of demand -- in terms of 
maintenance we're fine. But in terms of long-term assistance, we're not." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the tiny Help of Ojai food pantry has been hit by high demand and low 
supplies that threaten to last well past Thanksgiving and Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, one or two families come seeking help each week. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Help of Ojai fed seven families in one day, said its operator, 
Marlene Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, if the demand gets any worse for our present-day needs," Spencer 
said, "we're not going to have anything left." 
</P>
<P>
 Laid off, struggling to pay unseasonably high heating bills and unable to 
stretch their food stamps any further, more poor people are turning to the Ojai 
pantry for help, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Or, they're just putting everything into paying the rent, and there's nothing 
left over," Spencer said. "They're setting priorities as far as keeping a roof 
over their head. You hate to think of it, but you could always hit a dumpster 
if you have to." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Yet so far this holiday season, one Ventura County food pantry seems to be 
faring better than most: Manna, in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The donations are starting to come in right now, and it looks fantastic," 
said Pauline Satterbo, executive director of Manna. 
</P>
<P>
 With a recent truckload of fresh produce -- onions, potatoes and such -- and 
81 turkeys donated by the Rotary Club, the pantry was well stocked for 
Thanksgiving, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just pray that the holidays will bring in the rush of donations, and so 
far -- boy -- they just keep on doing it," she said. "It keeps coming in." 
</P>
<P>
 But all the food bank operators agreed: Once the holidays end and donations 
fall off, thousands of Ventura County residents will still be hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 Food Share is running a five-year fund-raising drive called Hunger 2000 in 
hopes of reaping $1 million in donations to pay for a $500,000 warehouse 
expansion and create an endowment to buy more food in the future, Mangis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see the county really needs a strong food bank, and we can't rely on 
outside sources to maintain that food bank," he said. "We can't rely on (USDA 
food) anymore. We have to rely on ourselves, so to speak." 
</P>
<P>
 FYI 
</P>
<P>
 Donations of food or money for Food Share can be dropped off at its Oxnard 
headquarters between 8 a.m. and 2 p.m., Monday through Friday, at 4156 N. 
Southbank Road.

CHRISTMAS SPIRIT ON PARADE IN SANTA PAULA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRA E. STOLL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An American flag led the Santa Paula Christmas Parade, and Santa Claus ended 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 2,500 people gathered on Main Street Saturday morning for the 
festive procession, organized by the city's Optimist Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the spectators were families who have been involved with the parade 
for generations. 
</P>
<P>
 Renee VanKalsbeek, a lifelong Santa Paula resident, said she remembers 
marching as a majorette with the Santa Paula High School band in the 1970s. 
Saturday, she watched her son Andrew, 9, lead off the parade with his fellow 
Cub Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew said he thought the event was "really fun." 
</P>
<P>
 His favorite entry in the parade? "The truck carrying all the Girl Scouts," 
Andrew answered without a moment's hesitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Lorraine Huerta, 27, a Santa Paula legal secretary, said she had been coming 
to the parade with her family for 10 years. "We don't ever miss it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Huerta said Santa Claus was her favorite parade participant. 
</P>
<P>
 She was not alone. The red-suited, white-bearded Christmas character easily 
drew the loudest cheers as he rode down the parade route -- not in a sleigh, 
but in the back of the Santa Paula Fire Department's Engine No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to a child's question, Santa said his reindeer were at home, 
"resting up for the big night." 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first Santa Paula Christmas Parade for volunteer Santa David 
Mitchell, a Santa Paula resident who works as a foreman at an Oxnard 
manufacturer of Western belt buckles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just like to see the smiles on the kids' faces," Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade was an eclectic mixture of vehicles, groups and personalities, 
sometimes oddly juxtaposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Paula Mayor Pro Tem Robin Sullivan and county Supervisor Maggie Kildee 
were followed immediately by Miss Santa Paula, Donelle Michaud, and Miss Teen 
Santa Paula, Inez Vargas. 
</P>
<P>
 There were horseback riders, including the Arabian Lady, wearing a purple and 
gold costume and veil, and riding an Arabian horse. The Southern Shady Ladies, 
riding sidesaddle, were followed by a 7-year-old girl in her first parade, 
riding a 30-year-old horse. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There were community organizations. Members of the Santa Paula Moose Lodge 
sported red-and-white felt elf hats. Also wearing elf hats were the 100 Santa 
Paula Girl Scouts, Andrew's favorites, who rode in the parade on the back of a 
flatbed truck. 
</P>
<P>
 One contingent of Shriners came from Santa Paula and another from Oxnard, both 
zipping down Main Street in one-person antique-style cars so small that the 
drivers had their knees sticking out the windows. 
</P>
<P>
 There were vehicles of all shapes and sizes -- a drag-racer, two ambulances, 
the Latino Pride Car Club, the Ventura County Model A Ford Club and the New 
Vision Santa Paula Car Club, whose members made their souped-up cars rear in 
the air like bucking broncos. 
</P>
<P>
 The parade also included a bright yellow 1956 Ford station wagon representing 
Taco Bell, soon to open a branch in Santa Paula. The station wagon stayed a 
respectful distance away from parade participant Ronald McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers said one purpose of the parade was to boost holiday shopping 
traffic for downtown merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 One owner of a clothing and electronics store on Main Street credited the 
parade with boosting the number of shoppers in his store by 60%. 
</P>
<P>
 But the parade was no cure-all, he said. "They're not buying, just looking," 
said Jae Kang, owner of Buena Modas.

VALLEY BRIEFING: ZONES OF CONTROVERSY; REDEVELOPMENT: OFTEN MISUNDERSTOOD, 
OFTEN FEARED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Redevelopment is one of the most powerful tools a local government can use to 
turn around a run-down neighborhood. It is also one of the most feared and 
misunderstood. 
</P>
<P>
 In the jargon of urban planners, the term "redevelopment" has a very specific 
meaning. It is the process by which local governments exercise a broad range of 
powers to eliminate blight -- whether a failing downtown or a neighborhood of 
sagging apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, redevelopment meant eradicating the blight of unsafe slums, but 
cities have stretched the definition of blight to include anything from 
irregular lot sizes to neighborhoods losing population. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the easiest way to think about redevelopment is as a bundle of powers. 
The two most important: condemning private property for new development and 
keeping property tax revenue that otherwise would be shared with other 
government agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the intent of redevelopment -- reviving declining neighborhoods -- is 
noble, its implementation in neighborhoods across Southern California often has 
been greeted with suspicion and hostility. How It Works 
</P>
<P>
 * Boundaries: Local government establishes "survey area" to be redeveloped. 
</P>
<P>
 * Blight: The redevelopment agency formally finds that the survey area is 
blighted and in need of repair. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mapping: Project area map is drawn up. 
</P>
<P>
 * Standards: Development standards are formulated, regulating how new projects 
will be built. 
</P>
<P>
 * Financing: Financing is arranged, generally through bond issues guaranteed 
by future tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oversight: Citizens advisory committee formed to oversee implementation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Time: Project areas remain in effect for 20 to 35 years. During this time, 
the redevelopment agency uses its powers of tax-increment financing and eminent 
domain to arrange private projects for the area. Eminent Domain 
</P>
<P>
 The most feared tool of a redevelopment agency is its power of eminent domain 
-- or its ability to seize property from unwilling sellers. Traditionally, 
eminent domain is to acquire land for schools, roads and other public projects, 
but it can also be used to cobble together large parcels of land needed for big 
projects like supermarkets or shopping malls or car dealerships. 
</P>
<P>
 But a redevelopment agency can condemn property even if the final owner of the 
land will be a private developer. Eminent domain laws require the government to 
pay property owners fair market value as determined by a jury. Tax-Increment 
Financing . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Hard to understand, "tax-increment financing" often is one of the most 
attractive reasons for a local government to create a redevelopment area. It 
essentially allows the redevelopment agency to finance improvements through 
future property tax increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds are issued early in the project's life to pay for improvements, such as 
roads and sewers, that might attract new development. The bonds are paid off 
with the tax increment. Money from the tax increment can also be used to 
purchase parcels that are sold to developers for a "write down," or a 
considerably lower price than the property is worth. Such incentives often are 
required to entice developers into risky areas. . . . Explained 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine a building worth $200,000 when a redevelopment area is created. Every 
year the building generates $2,000 in property tax, which is split several 
ways. Say that it is sold two years later for $300,000, and that the building 
then generates $3,000 a year in property tax. The $1,000 difference -- or the 
tax increment -- would go only to the redevelopment agency. The other agencies 
would split just the original $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 This process is repeated every time a building is sold or reassessed. So if 
this building is sold two years later, this time for $400,000, it would 
generate $2,000 in tax increment. The other agencies still would split the 
original $2,000. Redevelopment History 
</P>
<P>
 1940s-1950s 
</P>
<P>
 After World War II, the federal government launches massive urban renewal 
programs to clear slums. Later, California supplements federal programs by 
adopting the Community Redevelopment Act. Because the act, like the federal 
initiative, is intended to protect public health, it is made part of the health 
and safety code. 
</P>
<P>
 1950s-1960s 
</P>
<P>
 California cities use redevelopment powers to acquire and raze large tracts of 
land, usually in and around their downtowns. Much of the land acquisition 
funding for these projects comes from the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 1970s 
</P>
<P>
 Redevelopment briefly falls out of favor. Many private developers refuse to 
take on the problems associated with redevelopment projects, and community 
organizers and anti-poverty groups complain that such efforts tossed poor 
people out of their homes. When the tax-cutting Proposition 13 passes in 
California, redevelopment suddenly becomes more popular among governments. The 
reason: local governments turn to tax-increment financing because they can no 
longer raise local taxes easily. 
</P>
<P>
 1980s-1990s 
</P>
<P>
 The formation of new redevelopment agencies hits a peak between 1981 and 1985, 
when 117 agencies are created and 204 project areas formed in California. Over 
the next five years, 50 more agencies are formed and 120 project areas created. 
During this time, most redevelopment agencies focus on attracting new retail 
ventures, hoping to cash in on sales tax revenues to bolster rapidly deflating 
budgets.

ROBBER TAKES $1,500 IN POST OFFICE HOLDUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A post office employee was shocked Saturday when an apparent customer handed 
her a note that said, "I have a gun, give me your money or I will kill you." 
The word kill was underlined in the threat, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The clerk then passed the unidentified man $1,500 in cash from behind the 
window where she was working. "She complied with the demand note out of fear," 
said Los Angeles Police Sgt. Don Kiefer of the Van Nuys Division. 
</P>
<P>
 The robber, who never pulled a gun, took the money and ran from the Sherman 
Oaks branch of the post office, located in the 14900 block of Magnolia 
Boulevard, heading in an unknown direction. No one saw him as he fled, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Saturday, officers at the Van Nuys division were still looking for the 
suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 The holdup began at 2:30 p.m. when the man entered the post office posing as a 
customer. Witnesses described him as a heavily built African American in his 
early 20s, Kiefer said. Most of his head was shaved, with a little hair left on 
top, witnesses added. 
</P>
<P>
 He was very calm as he entered the post office and waited in line before 
approaching the clerk with his note, witnesses said.

GROUPS STAGE RALLY AGAINST TRADE PACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A collection of mostly conservative political groups held a midday rally near 
Topanga Plaza mall Saturday to oppose the global trade agreement scheduled for 
key votes in Congress this week. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 people from Ross Perot's United We Stand America group and several 
other organizations distributed flyers to passing motorists, burned a banner 
warning "Beware One World Government," and carried signs urging sympathizers to 
"Call Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters complained the United States would lose its sovereignty under 
the agreement's proposed World Trade Organization that would govern world 
commerce, replacing the the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
 As passersby honked in support, the demonstrators also demanded a delay in the 
votes until after the new, Republican-controlled Congress convenes in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, there's no difference between the Republicans and Democrats" on 
the issue, said Perot supporter Al Kass, a retired aerospace worker who lives 
in Saugus. "They're not listening to the people, that's all." 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of America is still asleep on this issue," said Paul Borraccia of the 
Monrovia-based National Health Federation, a group that advocates 
unconventional health treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 There were no arrests during the two-hour, peaceful demonstration, though at 
one point Los Angeles police told the crowd at Victory and Topanga Canyon 
boulevards to stay out of the street or face arrest. Private security guards 
from a building complex at the corner also warned them to stay off the 
property's lawn.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CELEBRATIONS OF HANUKKAH BEGIN TONIGHT

<P>
 Jews across Ventura County will celebrate the beginning of Hanukkah tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-day holiday marks the victory of the Jews in a war against 
Syrian-Greek rulers who had desecrated the Jews' temple in Jerusalem.Hanukkah 
candles recall the oil lamp the Jews lit when they rededicated the temple in 
165 BC. 
</P>
<P>
 The holiday's timing depends on the lunar Jewish calendar. Usually it starts 
in December, but this Hanukkah falls very early in the Gregorian calendar, 
rabbis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Shimon Paskow of Temple Etz Chaim in Thousand Oaks said the holiday's 
early timing might leave Jewish children depressed when Christmas rolls around. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since Hanukkah is so early, there's nothing to compensate for all the 
Christmas commotion, and kids may feel a little left out," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Paskow said many Jewish children go to Jewish camps over the winter school 
break. And he said the early holiday has been good for business, bringing 
shoppers to the stores before the traditional Thanksgiving start of the holiday 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Temple Etz Chaim will have a service at 5 p.m. today at 1080 Janss Road, 
featuring the lighting of Hanukkah candles. Afterward, congregants will sing 
Hanukkah songs and eat potato pancakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chabad of Ventura Jewish Community Center is planning to welcome the 
holiday by lighting a giant Hanukkah menorah in front of the Broadway 
department store in Buenaventura Plaza on South Mills Road. The observance will 
also include singing and potato pancakes. 
</P>

Elohim-Reform Temple of Conejo in Thousand Oaks both plan Hanukkah celebrations

 Hoping to persuade the federal government to remove a weather radar tower on 
Sulphur Mountain, Ojai Valley residents will hold a candlelight vigil tonight 
in Libby Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents fear that radiation emitted by the 98-foot-tall National Weather 
Service tower, nicknamed "the Black Orb," is hazardous to their health. Federal 
officials have maintained that the radiation is harmless. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's event, which begins at 6 p.m., will include bagpipe music. It is

 Field laborers and packinghouse workers at Muranaka Farms in Moorpark 
unanimously approved a new United Farm Workers contract negotiated with the 
company, officials said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement, approved at a UFW meeting Friday night, will set up an 
unprecedented labor contract in which farm workers will share in some 
management decisions, said Mario Brito, the regional director of the union. 
</P>
<P>
 "The workers had really pushed for this contract," Brito said. "This is a way 
to show that workers are really interested in keeping the company profitable." 
</P>
<P>
 The approximately 150 workers at the company, who earn from $12,000 to $14,000 
a year, will also receive 5% to 8% pay raises, union officials said. SCOTT

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; COUNCIL TO ALLOW ADS ON BUS STOP BENCHES

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to maintain bus service and keep fares from skyrocketing, the Simi 
Valley City Council has agreed to alter its sign ordinance to allow advertising 
on bus stop benches. 
</P>
<P>
 The city hopes to raise about $15,000 a year with the advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, the council increased fares from 75 cents to $1, following an 
increase in operating costs and a drop in revenue of as much as 5% on some 
routes. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost to run the four Simi Valley Transit bus lines, which carried 400,000 
riders last year, will be an estimated $1.6 million next year. Operating 
expenses are expected to increase by $83,000 this year, the result of rising 
maintenance, fuel and salary costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Billboard advertising is prohibited in the city. SARA CATANIA

A GRAMMAR QUESTION? THIS TEACHER IS AT YOUR BECK AND CALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Millions of people out there carry the private shame of the grammatically 
challenged. 
</P>
<P>
 Short-shrifted by their public schools or simply baffled by their mother 
tongue, they suffer the torment and occasional public embarrassment of poor 
spelling, bad syntax and awful punctuation. 
</P>
<P>
 But in those moments of deepest despair -- when they are stumped trying to get 
pronouns to agree with antecedents or divine the difference between affect and 
effect -- one Michael Strumpf and his Grammar Hotline are there to help. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hello, Syracuse," Strumpf says into the phone after the caller identifies 
herself as Mary, a former schoolteacher in that city. "No, no, it's nothing to 
be embarrassed about. Go ahead and read me the sentence." 
</P>
<P>
 And so it goes. Strumpf sets the woman straight, bids her farewell and goes on 
to his regular work grading English papers at Moorpark College. 
</P>
<P>
 Piled high on his desk are essays from about 100 students assigned to his 
three introductory writing classes. Each student will write seven essays over 
the semester, and Strumpf will go over the essays with each student one-on-one. 
The workload grows even greater as he demands that the papers be rewritten when 
they don't measure up. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to explain every comma," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the hundreds of essays he grades every semester, Strumpf, 60, 
answers about 300 calls a week from all over the country on the 20-year-old hot 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 After a recent article circulated nationwide about his service, calls poured 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unbelievable! We've had 317 calls today," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an epidemic of calls -- Monitor Radio, the Canadian Broadcast System, 
CBS Radio, KNX, the Boston Herald," he said. "And you know the one question 
they all asked me: 'How much do you get paid?' They can't believe anyone would 
do this for free. But that's the reason we're alive, right? -- to help other 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not just about helping other people, though. Strumpf, a self-styled guru 
of grammar, is on a mission to rid the United States of sentences slovenly 
strewn together with a careless disregard for proper English. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He sees this as a national issue. He dreams of a Literacy Corps -- an 
organization modeled after the Peace Corps whose volunteers would answer 
questions of grammar and punctuation for any American who cared to inquire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't get me wrong," he said. "America is the greatest country in the world. 
But I travel to other countries, and people there are speaking and writing 
properly. Why can't we?" 
</P>
<P>
 For Strumpf, bad grammar is one more symptom of the societal decay he sees 
demonstrated by increased crime, drug use, political corruption and the decline 
of the family.  
</P>
<P>
 Strumpf faults the public school system for graduating students who lack basic 
skills in their own language. And he has some radical ideas of how to reform 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get rid of the boards of education, all the administrators and the fat that 
doesn't have anything to do with teaching kids," he said, launching into a 
short list of quick fixes for the country's schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Start testing teachers -- make sure they are professionals," he said. Get rid 
of tenure -- bad teachers hide behind it and good teachers don't need it. Start 
paying classroom teachers more -- they should be the second-most-important 
focus next to students." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Strumpf himself ended his quest for a doctorate in English at USC just one 
year short of the degree. 
</P>
<P>
 " Ph.D. stands for 'Piled Higher and Deep" he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A teacher for the past 38 years, Strumpf supplements his college work with 
tutoring and consulting for corporations. He has also worked as an expert 
witness in legal cases that hinge on the grammatical interpretation of 
contracts. He swears he was an expert witness on a case that was decided on the 
implication of a single semicolon. 
</P>
<P>
 He has also managed to write several nonfiction books and is working on two 
novels and a play. He developed his devotion to language growing up in New York 
City, learning Greek and Latin at school and the art of conversation at home. 
</P>
<P>
 His love for words and their usage can lead to sharp criticism of those who 
break the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 He recently fired off a harsh missive to the Moorpark College newspaper, for 
example, after finding a page rife with errors. Showing the offending page, he 
pointed out a misspelling in a headline and the misuse of the word due . 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't spell do ," he said in disbelief. "This is college we're talking 
about here." 
</P>
<P>
 Strumpf does not fault the students. For him, the mistakes are another example 
of a failed educational system. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they can't teach these kids properly in 12 years, something is terribly 
wrong," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On other fronts, he said, our language is constantly being ravaged by pop 
culture. He singles out star athletes in particular, shaking his head at the 
damage he says they have wreaked upon English. 
</P>
<P>
 He wants professional teams to require their players to attend a weekend 
seminar on proper grammar. 
</P>
<P>
 "A weekend would be enough," he said. "Just give me a weekend." 
</P>
<P>
 More and more students coming into his classes struggle with simple English 
expression, a problem his school shares with major universities, he said, 
adding that it's not all the schools' fault.  
</P>
<P>
 Students "are not dumber today. But they've taken more punches to the head and 
they're having a hard time standing up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So Strumpf does what he can. He has the hot line that takes calls Monday 
through Friday from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. And every Monday night at a local 
restaurant he hosts a meeting for any student struggling with grammar. 
</P>

 "I want them to know I'm on their side," he said, "but there are rules." 
</P>
<P>
 He starts each of his college classes by shaking hands with all his students. 
</P>
<P>
 "We then have a sort of contract to get down to work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When he addresses a student, he will preface his or her name with "Great," as 
in "Great Mary, do you have a question?" And he likes to refer to his students 
as "scholars in training." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he is no pushover. He drops students who miss more than five classes 
and regularly gives out Ds and Fs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students need to know there is a right and wrong," he said. "They don't mind 
being told they've done something wrong. They just need reasons. That's why 
people call the hot line. They don't just want answers, they want to know why." 
</P>
<P>
 The people who call range from executives and journalists to parents and 
teachers. Strumpf's message for those trying to remember lessons from long-ago 
English classes is simple. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can help," he said. "All you have to do is call."

SOCIAL WORKERS AIDING THE ELDERLY FACE DAUNTING TASK; HEALTH: ADULT PROTECTIVE 
SERVICES EMPLOYEES ARE FREQUENTLY OVERWHELMED AND PAID LITTLE TO COPE WITH 
OFTEN HEARTBREAKING CRISES.

<P>
 The voice on the phone was frantic. 
</P>
<P>
 The in-home caregiver was trying in vain to cope with an 84-year-old woman who 
alternately pain. The elderly woman -- call her Martha -- was suffering from 
dementia. She refused medicine and food, she was shedding weight, she was 
incontinent and had bedsores. Martha cursed in response to pleas that she go to 
the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The caregiver had been especially conscientious in a hard, often thankless job 
that pays only the minimum wage. And now she seemed about to unravel. 
</P>
<P>
 At the other end of the phone, social worker Glenda Stovall was soothing and 
understanding. But beneath the calm, professional manner, Stovall was worried. 
Martha might be dying -- and Stovall wasn't sure what to do about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Stovall is a crisis intervention social worker for Los Angeles County, and 
this was but one of more than 25 tough cases in her active file. 
</P>
<P>
 Her caseload also included a gaunt elderly woman living alone in a filthy 
apartment strung with spider webs and cluttered with rotting food. The woman 
was demented and covered with lice, but was unable to obtain medical care 
because she had no private insurance and was blocked from getting public 
assistance by a paperwork snarl. 
</P>
<P>
 There was also the case of an elderly couple whose mentally handicapped 
daughter was suspected of physically abusing them. And then there was the 
90-year-old man whose neighbor had been robbing him of his savings and had 
gotten himself written into the elderly man's will. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stovall, who works out of Pasadena, is one of 50 such social workers employed 
by the county Department of Community and Senior Services. Each handles 250 
cases per year. These Adult Protective Services workers, who have offices 
throughout the county, are often overwhelmed, but paid little. Their job is to 
cope with situations involving dementia and unhealthy living conditions among 
older people, as well as problems such as abuse experienced by vulnerable 
people over the age of 18. 
</P>
<P>
 The APS office in Van Nuys is responsible for cases in the San Fernando, Santa 
Clarita and Antelope valleys, as well as the city of Burbank. Eight social 
workers, including two stationed in Lancaster, are permanently assigned to this 
area, said Eileen Wossner, who heads the Van Nuys office. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Northridge earthquake, a special unit composed of another seven 
workers was created to help people who might have suffered difficulties related 
to the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 100 to 150 calls that the Van Nuys office receives each month, many 
concern individuals suspected of self-neglect, Wossner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the county, the majority of clients are elderly, but some are 
younger people who are handicapped or retarded. 
</P>
<P>
 Helping older people in the Antelope Valley is particularly challenging 
because of the area's remoteness and the attitude of some of the residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the older people have lived there for years," Wossner said. "They 
live in remote areas. . . .They have more of a pioneering spirit. They want to 
do things on their own."  
</P>
<P>
 Almost all the cases handled by Adult Protective Services workers are 
difficult, and frequently, they are heartbreaking. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot always help these people," said Stovall. "Sometimes, there's 
nothing we can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Martha's might be such a case, she feared. 
</P>
<P>
 Stovall's cases come to her from concerned neighbors who call the elder abuse 
hot line and from other social service agencies. Or she might be called by an 
in-home caregiver hired by the county or by relatives of an elderly person. 
</P>
<P>
 As Stovall soothed Martha's caregiver over the phone, a home health care nurse 
arrived at the elderly woman's house to check on her at the social worker's 
request. 
</P>
<P>
 With Stovall still on the phone, the nurse and the home caregiver were somehow 
able to persuade Martha to go to the hospital. The next hurdle, said Stovall, 
would be to get the hospital -- Kaiser Permanente Medical Center on Sunset 
Boulevard -- to admit the woman against her will if she changed her mind, as 
she probably would once she arrived at the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of uncooperative but seriously ill patients such as Martha, 
doctors and hospital officials frequently are unwilling to seek involuntary 
commitments, according to Stovall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has to get to the point where people are literally living in their own 
feces," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha appeared to be getting close to that. 
</P>
<P>
 "If she wants to die, that's her right," said Stovall, "but she has to die 
clean -- that's our responsibility." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, there were other cases to deal with. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Stovall routinely works alone, but on this day she was joined by fellow social 
worker Lori Barraza, who has a similar caseload. Their jobs require a 
bachelor's degree, and both majored in social work. Stovall also has a master's 
in counseling and Barraza will soon receive one. Their salary: $33,780 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The women are good friends. They have worked in other social service jobs for 
two decades, they each went back to college in middle-age and they have similar 
reasons for pursuing the demanding, stressful work. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have to go out of this world filthy and not eating, and living in ugly 
circumstances, is just not right," Stovall said of her elderly clients. "To be 
able to help them out of that, makes me feel better -- that I've done a little 
something, anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Stovall and Barraza climbed into an Isuzu Rodeo and swept onto the Foothill 
Freeway heading toward Los Angeles. Barraza was at the wheel of her van as 
Stovall used a cellular phone to alert hospital personnel that Martha was on 
the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is going to say she doesn't want to stay, but that's because of the 
dementia," Stovall told a hospital worker. "She cannot go home." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Barraza had pulled off the freeway and parked on a side 
street near a rundown apartment house where another client lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, Catherine -- the names of clients have been changed for reasons of 
confidentiality -- stood on a filthy rug in the living room. The 86-year-old 
woman was skeletal, her hair hung lank and dirt was caked in the lines of her 
face. Catherine's eyes were wide and vacant as she smiled at the social 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 There was garbage on the kitchen floor, the sink was caked with filth, the 
stove top was rusty and unused. In the refrigerator were old, partially eaten 
TV dinners brought by Meals on Wheels. Kitchen shelves were dense with spider 
webs, studded with dead roaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Stovall had been here before, but Catherine didn't recognize her. 
</P>
<P>
 When had Catherine last seen a doctor, asked Stovall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't go to doctors," Catherine replied pleasantly. 
</P>
<P>
 And that, Stovall said as she left, must change. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to get her hospitalized," said Stovall as she got back into the van. 
"I think she has the potential to improve. I would like to put her in board and 
care." 
</P>
<P>
 Catherine is a foreign national living permanently in the U.S. She is eligible 
for Medi-Cal and aid through Social Security, but the woman's ex-husband had 
possession of vital information and paperwork and was uncooperative. 
</P>
<P>
 Her case had been referred to Stovall months ago and she thought she had 
resolved it by locating the necessary paperwork, but Catherine had somehow 
fallen through the cracks in the social services system until a senior center 
called about her condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Barraza had by now pulled to the curb in front of a well-kept apartment 
building to check on one of her own clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa is a 75-year-old widow whose daughter died early this year. She has 
developed a pattern of binge drinking. Barraza had been unable to reach the 
woman by phone, and her concern mounted as she repeatedly pounded on the door 
and called the woman's name to no avail. 
</P>
<P>
 When Lisa finally answered the door, the pleasant, soft-spoken woman was not 
drunk, but acknowledged that she had fallen into depression. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know why lately I've been feeling like this," she said. "I don't even 
want to get dressed or go anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, Lisa makes sojourns to a nearby market just to get out of the house 
despite grotesquely swollen and painful ankles. 
</P>
<P>
 But lately, the depression had kept her inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even clean the house or anything," she said. "I just lay around and 
sleep and watch TV. Sometimes I don't eat at all. I just drink coffee." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Lisa was planning a trip to see a granddaughter in another state. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Barraza asked permission to look around the apartment that was cluttered and 
over-furnished, but nonetheless clean. There were knickknacks and family 
snapshots everywhere. When Barraza returned to the living room, she asked Lisa 
if she had ever thought about harming herself. Lisa denied any such notions. 
</P>
<P>
 But back in the car, Barraza was even more worried than she had been before 
the visit. In Lisa's bedroom, the social worker had found brochures from the 
Hemlock Society, a group that provides information on suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Stovall's job is doing what amounts to preliminary detective work into 
complaints that elderly people are being swindled. 
</P>
<P>
 That afternoon in the office, Stovall phoned a man she termed a "perp" -- 
short for perpetrator. A senior citizens center had called to say that 
90-year-old Carl had been fleeced by a neighbor. Another social services agency 
had been able to put the man's financial affairs in the hands of an old and 
trusted friend, but Stovall would now look into the alleged crime. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lengthy phone conversation, Stovall persistently but gently questioned 
the suspected perp. The man said that he had begun running errands and doing 
chores for Carl when the elderly man could no longer take care of himself. 
</P>
<P>
 One thing led to another, he said, and Carl began signing checks for his 
neighbor to cover various expenses. Stovall had already determined that $10,000 
had been drained from the elderly man's bank account over a short period, 
leaving a balance of $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspected perp readily admitted to Stovall that he used $1,500 of Carl's 
money to get a lawyer to write a will leaving all the old man's money to him. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time she hung up, Stovall was convinced that the helpful neighbor had 
indeed helped himself to the vulnerable elder's savings. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, before she left the office on that Friday evening, Stovall was 
assured by a Kaiser intern that Martha would be admitted to the hospital or 
placed in a convalescent home for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Often, crisis intervention workers are able to solve a problem and close a 
case. Sometimes they are not. Some cases come back again and again, perhaps 
never to be resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some updates on the crisis situations Stovall and Barraza handled on 
that recent Friday: 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Carl and the helpful neighbor, Stovall turned her findings over 
to police, who opened a criminal investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In Lisa's case, Barraza phoned the out-of-state granddaughter, who was so 
concerned that she arranged for the elderly woman to come and live with her. 
</P>
<P>
 In Catherine's case, Stovall used information supplied by the Canadian Embassy 
to obtain an emergency Medi-Cal card for the elderly woman. Catherine was 
hospitalized and Stovall hopes to have her admitted to a board and care home. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is going to be fine," predicted Stovall. "She's going to be taken care 
of." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there is the case of Martha. 
</P>
<P>
 Stovall thought Martha was safely in the hospital for the weekend, but she 
learned the following Monday that the woman had been sent home and had spent 
two to three days alone and without food. 
</P>
<P>
 A Kaiser official said that Martha's medical information is confidential, but 
went on to say that involuntary admissions must be made with care. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot force a patient who has the capacity to make decisions to take any 
treatment or to be transferred to a facility against their will," said Kit 
Neimeyer, area public affairs director for Kaiser. "This particular case is 
very complex," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the days that followed, Stovall was able, with the help of the in-home 
caregiver and a hospital social worker, to persuade Martha to admit herself to 
Kaiser.  
</P>
<P>
 While she was there, the elder abuse hotline received a call from a hospital 
employee who was concerned that Martha would be discharged. 
</P>
<P>
 The information from the employee, who asked to remain anonymous, was relayed 
to Stovall: 
</P>
<P>
 "Client is unable to care for self. Requires skilled nursing, but refuses to 
stay. Client is extremely frail. Doesn't take medication. Has a history of 
dementia. Was admitted to Kaiser for skin infection and malnutrition. . . . 
Suffered a fractured hip in early '94. Has a history of bleeding ulcer. Subject 
to fainting episodes . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 Martha stayed in the hospital a week and was again discharged to her home. 
</P>
<P>
 When Stovall went to Martha's home to check on her, the frail old woman came 
to the door and, barely able to stand, greeted the social worker with 
hostility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to see you," she said in a surprisingly strong voice. "Mind your 
own business." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll leave you alone for now," said Stovall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It better be forever," said Martha. 
</P>
<P>
 But Stovall won't stay away forever. She was able to locate Martha's attorney 
and a daughter in another city who did not know of her mother's grave 
condition. She was also able to locate a substantial bank account that Martha 
had misplaced. 
</P>
<P>
 The daughter, the lawyer and the faithful, long-suffering caregiver are doing 
what they can to aid Martha, but she remains belligerent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're right back to square one," said Stovall, "but we do have people 
involved and I think they will get her into a board and care." In the meantime, 
Martha's daughter and caregiver have found that the elderly woman will 
cooperate to some extent if they make a certain threat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Martha hates me so much," said Stovall, "that all they have to do is mention 
that Glenda Stovall is going to come over. They even got her to bathe."

PASADENA COALITION STRUGGLES TO ATTAIN HARMONY; NONVIOLENCE: FORMED AMID 
OUTRAGE OVER THE SLAYINGS OF THREE YOUTHS, A YEAR LATER THE POLITICALLY POTENT 
GROUP HAS RAISED FUNDS FOR YOUTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The early morning sun had yet to warm the gray stone walls of All Saints 
Episcopal Church. But inside a conference room, 15 members of the Coalition for 
a Non-Violent City steering committee sat at tables littered with empty 
plastic-foam coffee cups. 
</P>
<P>
 They were 35 minutes into a full court press by Pasadena City Councilman Isaac 
Richard. With his trademark angry rhetoric and political moralizing, he urged 
them to back him when he proposes that the council ban concealed weapons at all 
city-sanctioned public meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's members, however, were wary of entangling themselves in Richard's 
personal political battles. 
</P>
<P>
 One coalition member asked politely: Did the councilman have someone on the 
seven-member council to second his proposal? 
</P>
<P>
 "If the coalition shows up, I'll have seven votes!" Richard shot back. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident illustrates the clout carried by the year-old anti-violence 
coalition. Spawned by outrage over last year's Halloween-night killings of 
three boys mistakenly gunned down by gang members, the Coalition for a 
Non-Violent City has rolled through Pasadena like a downhill snowball, picking 
up money, support and influence. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past year, the group incorporated as a nonprofit agency, raised 
$360,000, spent $40,000 on a giant community meeting, put 1,100 people on its 
mailing list and opened offices in Old Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, in some ways, the coalition still is struggling to coalesce. 
</P>
<P>
 Members argue, sometimes in tears and anger, over whether it should offer 
traditional, social work-type programs or address racism in society. The 
coalition's unwieldy, Hydra-headed committee system lacks an overall game plan. 
Some have rejected the group's meetings as elitist talkfests that are short on 
action. Others, many of them young people at risk on the streets, know nothing 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Those most involved are not disheartened, pointing out that although people 
are arguing, at least they're talking to each other. Many of them are from such 
different walks of Pasadena life that, under ordinary circumstances, they 
probably would never have even met each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coalition represents a movement, not a program," insists the group's 
co-founder, Shirley Adams. 
</P>
<P>
 With almost missionary zeal, Adams recounted a recent meeting that brought 
together the mother of a slain child, an Altadena gangbanger, a high school 
principal and a Junior League member. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a whole level of discussion going on in the city that has never taken 
place before," said Adams, head of the Pasadena-Foothill branch of the Los 
Angeles Urban League. "The coalition could be one of the most significant 
structures put in place in Pasadena." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in the coalition's early days, the governor's office sent a query to 
the group asking what it was working on, after it looked like an unusual 
movement was afoot in Pasadena. Residents had organized quickly in the wake of 
the shock and outrage that gripped the city after three young teen-age boys, 
mistaken for gang members, were gunned down by gang members on Halloween night, 
1993, in central Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 A first meeting of 12 community leaders called by George Regas, the rector of 
All Saints Episcopal Church, was followed by a second meeting of 50 
participants; hundreds more began attending as meeting after meeting took 
place. Participants included city department heads, social-service agency 
workers, community activists and residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition initially focused on gun control. But as more people got 
involved, the group increasingly turned its attention to the roots of violence: 
lack of job opportunities, run-down schools and housing, and racism directed 
against large segments of Pasadena's population, Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group focused particularly on the Northwest Pasadena area, where many of 
the city's low-income black and Latino residents live and which is plagued by 
gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 More than $360,000 has been raised, including $100,000 from the Irvine 
Foundation and $250,000 from the city of Pasadena. With part of the money, a 
coalition office in the Dodsworth Building in Old Pasadena was opened and three 
staff members were hired. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition also spread $75,000 among 17 grass-roots agencies and 
individuals that provide programs for young people, from theater projects and 
on-air radio and television training programs to drill and drum team 
performances and an overnight trip to the Monterey Bay Aquarium. 
</P>
<P>
 An Oct. 1 conference held by the coalition at the Pasadena Center drew more 
than 800 people. At the conference, which cost $40,000, attendees were fed a 
free breakfast and lunch while they attended seven different workshops on 
violence. A follow-up meeting Nov. 1 resulted in the creation of six 
independent task forces. Each task force is devising a plan of action. Another 
citywide meeting is planned for March 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is trying to decide how to spend the remaining $150,000 in city 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, as it begins a second year, serious fissures have erupted in the 
coalition's image of unity and momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Nov. 1 meeting, community activist Roy Hayes, who prefers to use the 
African name of Malik, challenged the group to allow in-depth discussions of 
racism. He was cut off by Adams and stormed out of the meeting hall, protesting 
loudly. 
</P>
<P>
 Later at the same meeting, coalition steering committee members Rena Dyson and 
Sharon Anderson came close to tears of frustration in a hallway as they argued 
with Adams and Regas. Dyson and Anderson, who founded the We Care group to keep 
Pasadena's streets quiet after the 1992 Los Angeles riots, had numerous 
complaints about the coalition but they followed one theme: Northwest Pasadena 
residents, those most harmed by violence, were being ignored and pushed out of 
the way by others flooding into the coalition, they insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 "A certain segment dictates the policy and the others are supposed to go 
along," Malik said on a recent morning at the Jackie Robinson Center in 
Northwest Pasadena. Further, every time the issue of racism is posed, the 
coalition shuts down the discussion, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Black men are viewed as the most violent and most underproductive element in 
this society," Malik said. "It's part of the problem that the coalition should 
address." 
</P>
<P>
 Malik outlined a host of criticisms that have been lobbed against the 
coalition. Among the complaints: 
</P>
<P>
 * The group has busied itself in endless meetings to discuss the city's 
problems, but, aside from fund raising, has produced few concrete results. 
</P>
<P>
 * The coalition is dominated by workers from social-service organizations and 
has too few everyday residents, especially blacks and Latinos who live in the 
Northwest section. 
</P>
<P>
 * Regas, a white Episcopal minister, and many others from All Saints' 
predominantly white congregation and staff have taken control of the group, 
resulting in whites helping out minorities in an old-fashioned "colonial 
mentality" setup, instead of minorities taking the lead and forging the group's 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 * The coalition has attracted many from outside Northwest Pasadena who are not 
familiar with the problems there. 
</P>
<P>
 * The group has not created groundbreaking solutions. Instead, it upholds the 
status quo and fails to investigate allegations of police harassment or the 
effectiveness of current youth programs, which many in the Northwest believe 
should be examined critically. 
</P>
<P>
 "The coalition is trying to do good, but they don't know exactly what's going 
on," said Tim Rhambo, a former gang member and now a community activist, as he 
strolled recently along Fair Oaks Avenue across from Robinson Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhambo said many coalition members sit in offices or head programs, but, in 
part because they don't actually live in Northwest Pasadena, are limited in 
their effectiveness. It is the community's residents, including gang members 
and young street leaders, who could bring peace, Rhambo said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who can regulate everything are right here," he said, pointing 
toward the street. "Pay them something and tell them to do something, and I 
guarantee results." 
</P>
<P>
 Other coalition critics come from the other end of town, such as Mark Talt. 
</P>
<P>
 A 34-year-old father of two who lives in the Oak Knoll neighborhood near the 
luxurious Ritz-Carlton Huntington Hotel, Talt, a securities broker, offended 
many at the Nov. 1 meeting when he stood up and confessed that he and his 
friends felt afraid living in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking around the room of 200 participants, he proclaimed that he didn't 
recognize a single person there, and he accused the group of shutting out 
people like himself. His comments prompted some at the meeting to accuse Talt 
of caring little for the rest of the city and showing up only when he feared 
violence might spread to his own neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days since the meeting, Talt said, he has received numerous phone 
calls, letters and business cards from coalition members, sympathizing with his 
concerns and urging him not to give up on helping out the coalition. He visited 
Northwest Pasadena and even showed up at the Nov. 15 steering committee 
meeting, where Councilman Richard appeared. Although there only to observe, 
Talt offered a few fund-raising suggestions when the discussion turned to 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 But Talt later said he was disappointed to find the coalition struggling with 
so many internal problems. And, he said, he still feels unwelcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to help, I want to reach out, but Mark Talt carrying an olive branch 
will get the same (negative) reception I got before," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Regas points out that others who live in Talt's upper-middle-class 
neighborhood have been actively involved with the coalition since its 
beginning. Equally active and welcomed into the coalition, he added, have been 
blacks from King's Villages, a low-income housing project in Northwest 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 Providing understanding among those from different sections of the city has 
been a daunting task for the coalition and is a high priority, Regas said. But 
even he and Adams differ over how to get there. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams, whose style is personal and hands-on and who greets acquaintances with 
"darling" and "baby," favors rotating coalition meetings to Northwest Pasadena. 
But Regas, who can be abrupt in his zeal to get things done, considers the 
issue of meeting locations a minor one. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the coalition has committed much of its focus to Northwest 
Pasadena, including funding youth groups there and proposing field trips for 
Pasadena residents to learn more about the troubled neighborhood. But the 
coalition is larger than the problems of Northwest Pasadena, Regas said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue of violence covers the map," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As for criticism that those from All Saints and from other social 
service-oriented groups have dominated the coalition, Regas agrees but says he 
is working on a transfer of power, to include elections or some other method of 
choosing leaders. At this point, Regas chairs the coalition steering committee, 
composed of about 30 people, many drawn from the staff at All Saints, from 
social service agencies and from city of Pasadena management ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 Regas admits he worries about the lack of concrete progress the group has 
made. But like Adams, he calls the coalition a movement and not a program. As 
such, he said, it needs the uninitiated and newcomers, the very people that 
some critics say slow down the group. Through the coalition, their efforts can 
be channeled, both said.

IT'S A LOSS OF FAITH; PRAYER IN SCHOOL DISTRACTS US FROM WHAT THE PURITANS 
TAUGHT: TRUST THE "I." IT IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR CIVIC COHESIVENESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

author of Days of Obligation (Viking). 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 This Thanksgiving weekend, when the refrigerator is full of leftover turkey, 
while the TV drones through the house with redundant football games, who 
remembers the Puritans? Our politicians are preaching to us about prayer in 
public schools, but who remembers the early Protestants? 
</P>
<P>
 Puritans are remembered today mainly for inviting Indians over for dinner. But 
the Puritans exerted a more lasting influence. They planted on American soil 
the first-person singular pronoun. Puritans taught Americans to trust the "I," 
to respect and protect individuals against the tyranny of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 It was odd, therefore, to hear an evangelical minister last week complain that 
U.S. courts pay too much heed to the rights of religious minorities. "What 
about the rights of the majority to pray?" he asked, apparently forgetting the 
genius of his own low-church tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 Adults lately voted in California to penalize the children of illegal 
immigrants. Adults propose packing children off to orphanages. Adults want to 
arrest children and try them as adults. Isn't it odd that at a time when adults 
barely tolerate children, they are so concerned with prayer in public schools? 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing odd about it, a friend of mine cynically observes. "We want children 
to pray in school so we will be able to beat them." 
</P>
<P>
 I am reminded of my own Roman Catholic school years. In the 1950s, nuns and 
priests were notorious for spanking and pulling ears. Catholic education was 
often corporal education. But nuns and priests took children seriously as moral 
creatures. We spoke, in those years, of the "age of reason." Catholics assumed 
that a child, by around age 7, was adult enough to be held morally responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 If we were punished because we were morally responsible, we were also welcomed 
into the church's formal prayer life. Home and church were linked to school by 
ancient rhythms, formulas of prayer. "Our Father, who art in heaven . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 It was never embarrassing for us to pray together. It was routine. We lived in 
a medieval village -- there was a single Episcopalian among us who discreetly 
bowed his head during our prayers. The day began with a "Morning Offering." At 
noon time, "The Angelus." As a group, we sang at funerals. We went to 
confession on Fridays. We chanted the Stations of the Cross during Lent. We 
sang hymns at Christmas. We said the rosary in school and at church, just as 
our parents prayed it at home. 
</P>
<P>
 What I learned as a Catholic schoolboy is that prayer is deeply communal, the 
link holding a congregation together. It was also our great advantage as 
Catholics. If low-church Protestantism gave Christianity an understanding of 
the "I," our great pronoun as Catholics was the "we." 
</P>
<P>
 America is so secular now, we forget the importance of theology to our civic 
life. During all the recent argument over Proposition 187, for example, who 
remembered that the 19th-Century dispute over immigration was theological? 
Then, nativists didn't argue race or skin color but religion. Could a Catholic 
become a good American? Could a Jew? 
</P>
<P>
 As the immigrants arrived, 19th-Century America could not resist them. A 
Protestant generosity prevailed. Ultimately, native-born Americans even came to 
romanticize the immigrant, saw themselves in the figure of the immigrant, 
stateless, willing to recreate himself, alone. ("We are all immigrants," 
Americans ended the century saying.) 
</P>
<P>
 Today, America is filling with Russian Jews and Moroccan Muslims and Thai 
Buddhists precisely because English Protestants planted the first-person 
singular pronoun in American soil. 
</P>
<P>
 It is deeply ironic that low-church Protestants are among the loudest today 
insisting that "America is a Christian country." They forget themselves: The 
reason America is not a Christian country is that we are a Protestant country. 
</P>
<P>
 You will say, perhaps, that I romanticize Puritans too much. After all, 
Puritans had witch hunts. And Puritans, though refugees from religious 
intolerance, ended up persecuting other religious communities, like the 
Quakers. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also true that the Puritans, though famous for their faith in the "I," 
ended up desperate for community. Puritans exchanged diaries of their singular 
lives. They would gather together to speak of the burden of standing alone 
before God. They resembled the parade of Americans today baring their souls on 
the "Oprah Winfrey Show." 
</P>
<P>
 If, as I believe, America is a culture defined by the Puritans, we, too, 
suffer contradictions from our individualism. Though we say we respect the 
rights of the individual, we go on witch hunts. Some days, we protect the 
rights of the village atheist; other days, we turn against the village atheist. 
America trumpets the "I" to the rest of the world, but at home we become a 
nation of abolitionists. Today, we keep the village atheist from smoking in 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly today, despite our celebration of individualism, there is a 
nostalgia for "family values" that can turn dangerous as we look for people to 
blame for our lack of civic cohesiveness. Our politicians encourage us to 
forget that the extraordinary thing distinguishing America is the individualism 
we inculcate in our children. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, we say, we are appalled. We talk about the need for schools to teach our 
children values. But American children learn our adult values all too well. 
They learn our values watching pro-football and from bratty Homer Simpson. They 
learn our values watching the way we handle traffic on the Santa Monica 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is we don't know how to moderate our own individualism. We don't 
know how to understand our own lives. We talk, instead, about reforming school. 
School prayer becomes the hope for a country where parent and child barely 
speak, much less pray together. 
</P>
<P>
 If the politicians were so interested in the prayer life of American youth, 
why don't they make it easier for parents, through tax breaks, to afford 
religious education for their children? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, but look at them each morning, our legislators at prayer. There they are, 
moral paragons, heads bowed, as the congressional chaplain intones a prayer 
that is barely more than feel-good jargon. 
</P>
<P>
 Prayer is not the business of Washington, nothing for politicians to allow or 
disallow. Prayer is not an activity comparable to flag-waving, a tool for 
forming good citizens. Prayer is a soul's life, routine, urgent. Prayer is 
private -- any student can pray, anytime in the day. (Who can prevent a child 
from starting her day with this prayer: "Dear God, this day is yours.") 
</P>
<P>
 Prayer can be said on the bus. It can be said in a crowd. It also belongs in a 
church. 
</P>
<P>
 And at home. But isn't this really the problem? The American home -- the 
silence between parent and child. 
</P>
<P>
 Prayer in school has become for the cultural right what bilingual education is 
for the cultural left. Bilingualists urge schools to give students 
"self-esteem" by allowing students to speak their "family language." 
Bilingualists forget that the point of public education is to teach children to 
think of themselves simply as that -- public people. School is not where one 
learns self-esteem; school rather is where one learns public esteem. It is the 
business of grandmothers to teach children that they are private people. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, advocates for prayer in schools say that students need to pray, silently 
or not. After all, a school has no right to keep a student removed from his 
faith. After all, doesn't the majority have a right to pray together -- 
regardless of the village atheist? 
</P>
<P>
 It is a reasonable argument, but it is not an American argument. America was 
constructed on a remarkable faith in the individual. America was constructed on 
a stunning Puritan faith. That faith gave Irish Catholics and Orthodox Jews a 
home a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 That early Puritan faith is what we should remember now when, for political 
advantage, politicians rise up and assume the parental role of moral guardians 
of the young.

NEITHER PALESTINIANS NOR ISRAELIS READY FOR PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Walter Russell Mead, Walter Russell Mead, a contributing editor to Opinion 
and a presidential fellow at the World Policy Institute at the New School, 
recently returned from the Middle East. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Middle East peace process, the most positive development in world affairs 
since the collapse of European communism and the brightest jewel in the 
tarnished crown of the Clinton Administration, is at a cross roads. Yasser 
Arafat has agreed to make peace with Israel, but the terms of the agreement are 
destroying his political authority. 
</P>
<P>
 On the West Bank and in Gaza, one can see the decline in Arafat's influence. 
In refugee camps, in the comfortable homes of the Palestinian elite and in the 
offices of what Palestinians hope will one day be the government of an 
independent state, Palestinians talk about their disappointment with the 
agreement and their disillusionment with Arafat. 
</P>
<P>
 Israelis aren't much happier. Agreement with the Palestinians furthered peace 
with Jordan, but it hasn't brought peace to the Israeli people. Soldiers are 
still being attacked, terrorists are still hitting civilian targets and 
ordinary Israelis are still haunted by insecurities as they go about their 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is this: Israelis and Palestinians are both weary of war, but 
neither side is quite ready for peace. It is the same problem that has haunted 
the Middle East since the Six Day War: The Israelis have won a war, but they do 
not know how to deal with their victory, and the Palestinians do not know how 
to deal with defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 The Palestinians, as usual, are in worse shape than the Israelis. Ever since 
the Balfour Declaration promised a homeland to Jews during World War I, 
Palestinian Arabs have fought to block the growth of Jewish settlements and the 
establishment of the Israeli state. They failed, and now they must live with 
the consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Economically, militarily, even politically, "independent" Palestine will look 
to Israel for investment, technology, markets and jobs. Furthermore, no Israeli 
government will recognize Palestinian independence without a security agreement 
that limits the power and size of the Palestinian armed forces and makes 
Palestine, in effect, a part of the Israeli security zone. 
</P>
<P>
 All this means that Arafat must be both the George Washington and the Konrad 
Adenauer of Palestinian history. As Washington, he must secure national 
independence and preside over the birth of a nation and a new political system. 
This won't be easy. Many Asian and African countries have achieved independence 
in the 20th Century, but few have achieved prosperity and stability. 
</P>
<P>
 But building an independent state is the easy half of Arafat's job. As the 
Adenauer of Palestine, Arafat must help his people come to terms with defeat. 
Just as Adenauer had to help a defeated West Germany accept its defeat and make 
friends with its conquerors, Arafat will have to work toward a rapprochement 
between a defeated Palestine and a triumphant Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Any Palestinian state that Arafat gets to build will be a Rump Palestine -- a 
state built on the remnants of territory given him by the Israelis. In the eyes 
of his ultranationalist enemies, Arafat's Palestine will inevitably be Vichy 
Palestine, a collaborationist regime that betrays the Palestinian nation it 
claims to serve. 
</P>
<P>
 As Arafat walks the tightrope, he needs help from the Israelis and the West. 
The West's job is the easy one; it is already familiar to U.S. taxpayers. Our 
job is to pay. Western governments and donor organizations must help the 
Palestinians set up a new government, compensate refugees and provide a network 
of social services so that Palestinian public opinion will be convinced that 
the benefits of cooperation outweigh the psychological satisfaction of 
continued hostility. 
</P>
<P>
 The West accepts this responsibility in principle but so far both governments 
and donors, worried about the lack of transparency in Palestinian accounting 
procedures, have been slow to deliver. This is ridiculous. As Arafat and his 
allies fight their political battle against nationalist and religious 
extremists, the Palestinian Authority must have the funds to improve the lives 
of ordinary Palestinians and, though it isn't polite to say so, to buy 
political support with liberal offers of contracts and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The important thing is to get the money moving. Spend now, audit later. Ten 
years from now, nobody will care how the money was spent or whether some of it 
was siphoned off en route, but they will care about whether peace was advanced. 
</P>
<P>
 The Israelis have a tougher job. If Arafat and the peace process are to 
survive, the Israelis must let him win political victories that will bolster 
his support among Palestinians. Given their strong bargaining position, the 
Israelis can force their Palestinian counterparts to accept almost any 
concessions. It is unwise to press this advantage far; Arafat cannot 
effectively resist Israeli demands, but neither can he sell too many 
concessions to the Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 If Arafat must walk a tightrope, so must Yitzhak Rabin. The Israeli prime 
minister cannot make concessions that undercut Israeli security or alienate a 
sensitive and divided Israeli public. But he must avoid forcing Arafat to 
comply with demands that discredit both Arafat and the peace process among the 
Palestinians. 
</P>
<P>
 This, unfortunately, is something that will be extremely difficult for Rabin 
to do. Israeli public opinion has been conditioned first by the Holocaust, then 
by 50 years of Middle Eastern warfare. With terrorist attacks continuing, 
Israelis cannot easily put their siege mentality behind them. Taking risks for 
peace goes against the grain for many Israelis; to make concessions to a 
defeated enemy seems foolish to people who have spent their lives in a struggle 
for survival. Yet, without concessions -- early withdrawals from certain 
settlements, generous economic terms, imaginative proposals on contested issues 
like Palestinian sovereignty and the status of Jerusalem -- peace between 
Israelis and Palestinians will remain a distant dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel must learn the lesson today that the United States began to absorb 
after 1945: It isn't enough to defeat your enemies -- you have to make friends 
with them. The United States cannot quite forget Pearl Harbor, but we have had 
to forgive it in order to build a new relationship with Japan. Two years after 
the guns fell silent in Europe, the Truman Administration and the American 
people had to send billions of dollars to the Germans and the Italians. Today, 
we are helping the Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 These lessons came relatively easy for the United States; they will be much 
harder for a small country like Israel, surrounded by former enemies whose 
goodwill is far from assured. But facts leave Israel no choice. Despite all his 
weaknesses and shortcomings, Arafat is the best hope the Israelis have to reach 
an understanding with the Palestinians. If the Israelis don't give him a 
helping hand, they will lose him -- and lose the prospect of turning the peace 
process into a permanent peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristotle wrote that magnanimity -- greatness and generosity of soul -- is the 
greatest quality of a statesman. It is the quality of victors, and it is the 
quality that Israel needs if its long struggle for survival and security is toy 
succeed.

THE WORLD; WHAT UKRAINE ESPECIALLY NEEDS NOW IS A LITTLE MORE NATIONALISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Charles A. Kupchan, Charles A. Kupchan, senior fellow for Europe at the 
Council on Foreign Relations and a professor at Georgetown University, was on 
the staff of the National Security Council for the first year of the Clinton 
Administration. He is author of The Vulnerability of Empire (Cornell University 
Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the leader of a country in the midst of an identity crisis, Ukrainian 
President Leonid D. Kuchma visited the White House last week with an unusual 
mission. Because Ukraine is still uncertain whether to orient its economy and 
foreign policy eastward or westward, Kuchma looked to President Bill Clinton to 
help his country find its way in post-Cold War Europe. Economic reform, 
financial assistance and Ukraine's pledge to rid itself of nuclear weapons were 
all key features of the agenda. But the most important message conveyed by 
Clinton was that Ukraine, if it so chooses, will be welcomed into the West. It 
is now up to Kuchma and his voters back home to take up the offer and ensure 
that Ukraine emerges as a stable, sovereign nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukraine's identity crisis has deep historical roots. After centuries of 
foreign rule and the intermixing of populations, the country is profoundly 
multiethnic and multicultural. Nowhere in Europe is national identity more 
amorphous. 
</P>
<P>
 This weak sense of nationhood has clear advantages. Ukraine is not Europe's 
next Yugoslavia. Ethnic Ukrainians and ethnic Russians comfortably live 
intermixed. Minority groups -- Poles, Romanians, Bulgarians, Moldovans, 
Belarussians, Jews and Hungarians -- are well-treated and protected by 
progressive legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukraine's blessing, however, is also its curse. The Balkans may have too much 
nationalism, but Ukraine has too little. As they struggle to establish a 
functioning state, Ukrainians are not bound together by the cultural, religious 
and linguistic ties of a common heritage. Elsewhere in Eastern Europe, 
nationalism provides a sense of cohesion for societies engaged in building new 
states. But in Ukraine, a nation and a state must be constructed anew. And 
without the momentum provided by an intact national identity, a new state is 
emerging very slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, diverging regional interests risk Ukraine's breakdown, if not its 
break-up. Because of Ukraine's size, location and nuclear weapons, not only its 
own stability, but Europe's as well, hangs in the balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukrainian television demonstrates the country's struggle to reclaim 
nationhood: Channel One is still Russia's national station. In my meetings with 
government officials and intellectuals, Russian, not Ukrainian, was the 
language of choice. When I asked whether the allegiances of Russian colleagues 
are ever questioned, the reply was always the same: "We do not know or care who 
is Ukrainian and who is Russian." 
</P>
<P>
 Why do most Ukrainians still prefer to speak Russian? Why aren't Ukrainians 
reveling in a reclamation of their identity like other East Europeans? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is that the images and symbols that constitute Ukrainian identity 
are up for grabs. After three centuries of Russian domination, much of Ukraine 
is so Russified that the country's language, religion and culture no longer 
serve as anchors of a national identity. 
</P>
<P>
 The weight of history and proximity is especially telling in the eastern half 
of the country. Independence means little for eastern Ukrainians, especially 
when it comes at the expense of raw materials and markets for their 
deteriorating factories. Residents do not want to surrender sovereignty to 
Russia, but they do want to restore the economic ties severed when the Soviet 
Union collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Russification reaches deep into the country's interior. In Uman, a provincial 
town in south-central Ukraine, residents speak a mix of Ukrainian and Russian. 
Twenty-five miles west into Ukraine's agricultural heartland, Russia's imprint 
is still clear. Nadia, who served in the Red Army during World War II and was 
married to an ethnic Russian, says of the country's new-found independence, 
"Ukrainian nationalism is worthless and meaningless. It is being forced on the 
country by people from the west." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as history and proximity have pulled eastern and central Ukraine toward 
Russia, they have pulled western Ukraine in the opposite direction. Centuries 
of outside rule -- first by Poles, then by Austro-Hungarians -- have left their 
mark. Buildings are more Central European in style. Religious affiliations 
point west. Western Ukraine is mostly populated by Greek Catholics, while 
Ukrainian and Russian Orthodox dominate the east. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither the Poles nor the Austro-Hungarians suppressed Ukrainian language 
and culture as did the Russians. Nor was the west as integrated into Russia's 
economy as the east. Westerners thus remain far more attached to a distinct 
national identity. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, this stronger sense of identity has limited ethnic content. Rukh, the 
main nationalist party, stands more for full sovereignty and independence from 
Russia than it does for a revival of Ukrainian culture and language. 
</P>
<P>
 The absence of a stronger sense of nationhood has its benefits. If ethnicity 
mattered more, eastern Ukraine and Crimea, where ethnic Ukrainians and Russians 
live interspersed, would be tinderboxes. Instead, Ukrainians and Russians 
alike, largely for economic reasons, desire closer relations with Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is a downside. Without a strong national identity and a national 
project that follows from it, Ukraine's political system has foundered. On 
questions as central as relations with Russia and economic reform, elites have 
been unable to chart a coherent course. Elections this year replaced a 
Parliament stalemated between communists and nationalists with one dominated by 
a coalition of communists and socialists. Kuchma enjoys Parliament's support of 
his plan to renew economic ties to Russia. But after only four months in 
office, Kuchma's position is already threatened. Although Parliament passed his 
package of economic reforms in October, his flanks are now exposed to a leftist 
coalition opposed to building a market economy. 
</P>
<P>
 It is no accident that the country has lacked the leaders needed to provide 
vision and push through reforms. Without nationalism and the sense of loyalty 
that accompanies it, many of the country's best and brightest are elsewhere. 
This brain-drain, mostly to Moscow, has deprived the country of the 
intellectual capital needed to build a nation and a state virtually from 
scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of a widely shared sense of nationhood also saps the electorate's 
energy and constrains its willingness to bear the costs of reform. National 
independence provides little emotional satisfaction. As a result, independence 
is judged in more narrow, materialistic terms. And the assessment is not 
favorable. As one Kievan told me, "National independence and privatization mean 
two things: corruption and economic decline."  
</P>
<P>
 Absent a shared sense of ethnicity and culture, responsibility for keeping the 
country together has fallen to the state. If nationhood cannot be based on a 
common ethnic identity, it must be based on civic identities that emerge from 
an integrated political community and the sense of belonging that comes with 
it. But the state is far from being able to provide basic economic welfare 
(Ukraine's inflation rate for 1993 was 8,940%), no less to create the political 
community necessary for a civic nationhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is Ukraine's central dilemma. Because the country lacks a strong sense of 
national identity, responsibility for providing political community and social 
cohesion falls upon the state. But the state is too weak to shoulder the 
responsibility -- largely because nationalism has not been available to drive 
forward painful political and economic reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's meeting with Kuchma has helped lay the groundwork for resolving this 
dilemma. The United States has pledged Ukraine $900 million in economic 
assistance and is pressing its G-7 partners to raise their contributions. 
Kuchma is fulfilling Ukraine's part of the deal by agreeing to make his country 
nuclear-free and guiding ambitious economic reforms through a hostile 
Parliament. Continued encouragement and support from the United States will 
increase the chances that these measures get implemented. This combination of 
domestic reform and outside assistance promises to provide Ukraine what it most 
needs: a functioning state. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, by offering the country a perch in the West, has also given Ukraine 
the chance to forge a new national identity. Because of its location and 
history, Ukraine will surely retain close ties to Moscow. But were Russia to 
re-absorb Ukraine, whether in whole or in part, whether by Moscow's design or 
Kiev's default, the prospects for erasing Europe's residual Cold War divides 
would considerably dim. 
</P>
<P>
 To ensure that this does not happen, Ukraine must keep one foot firmly planted 
in the West. This straddle is now possible only because Clinton has made clear 
that the option exists. As long as Ukraine takes up the offer of security 
assurances from the United States, new trade and investment links to the West, 
more contact with Americans and West Europeans, and more robust links to the 
North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the European Union and other institutions, 
the country should be able to resist the eastward pull of history. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukrainians must now do their part to keep reform moving ahead, proceed with 
denuclearization and build new links to the West. If they do so, Clinton's 
embrace of Kuchma will have helped provide Ukraine the more intact national 
identity that it needs if it is to balance between Europe's east and west. The 
Balkans have given nationalism a bad name in post-Cold War Europe. But in 
Ukraine, a little nationalism is just what's needed.

THE NATION; SONY'S WOES IN HOLLYWOOD REFLECT ITS WEAKNESS IN 'KNOWLEDGE VALUE' 
INDUSTRIES 
</P>

 Sony Corp.'s shocking announcement that it will write-down its Hollywood 
investment in Columbia Pictures by $2.7 billion highlights a major reason why 
Japan's once unstoppable economic juggernaut is slowing. Having built their 
economic empire on an indigenous aptitude for craftsmanship and innovation, 
Japanese companies like Sony are colliding with the limits imposed by an 
insular culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony's foray into Hollywood, like that of its competitor Matsushita Industrial 
Electrical Co., which owns MCA/Universal, has been hampered by its 
misunderstanding of the creative forces that go into a world-dominant 
entertainment product. Unlike the design, development and manufacture of a 
electronic gadget, the making of a successful film or record product demands an 
intuitive feel for the sensibilities of a diverse, global public. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Japanese tend to think from their own internal logic, the point of view 
of the company or family," Sony Deputy President Ken Iwaki told me not long 
after his company bought Columbia in 1989. "This is historically derived 
training. We get strong economic power but our awareness is not so strong." 
</P>
<P>
 To obviate their self-perceived cultural shortcomings, Sony and Matsushita 
purposely placed direct control of their studios into the hands of Americans. 
To a large extent, the relative success of Matsushita is a consequence of its 
decision to retain the strong management team already in place at MCA. Thus, 
the new Japanese owners did not alienate the studio's network of creative 
contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 Sony, by contrast, bought a lackluster studio and proceeded to compound its 
problems by replacing one set of weak old-boy-network managers with another of 
their own choosing. Furthermore, it transferred the authority to make key 
entertainment decisions to a New York-based executive who lacked studio 
experience. He stood by as his West Coast minions spent their yen on friends 
and family with an alacrity alarming even by Hollywood standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, even relatively talented Americans can prove quarrelsome, as 
Matsushita is finding out in its struggle with Sidney Sheinberg and his 
creative allies over control of MCA. Moreover, with as many as two or three new 
studios in the offing, "hands-off" Japanese owners now find themselves exposed 
and vulnerable to the migratory patterns of the entertainment complexes, both 
managerial and creative. Such behavior is utterly at odds with the system of 
lifetime employment and corporate loyalty prevalent in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Taichi Kiuchi, president of Mitsubishi Electric, another Japanese consumer 
electronics giant, traces much of the Japanese inability to "learn" 
entertainment management to the highly subjective nature of the business. 
"Japanese companies have a whole lot of problems when there's no blueprint or 
manual to learn from," he says. "We don't have any advantage in this business, 
which is a human product, not a machine. We don't have the diversity of 
population to make the creative cultural decisions." Japan's home-grown 
entertainment, it should be noted, has been losing market share to mostly 
U.S.-made products for a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese setbacks in entertainment also augur trouble for its economy. As 
wealthier countries are forced to cede much of mass manufacturing to developing 
countries, companies and regions will have to increasingly concentrate on what 
Japanese philosopher Taichi Sakaiya calls "knowledge value" industries, like 
fashion, entertainment and business services. 
</P>
<P>
 By treating "knowledge value" industries as if they were strictly industrial, 
the Japanese have suffered a score of reversals not only in Hollywood but in 
computer software, financial services and real estate. In contrast to making 
cars or CD players, "knowledge value" industries are culturally intensive. 
Understanding the importance of taste, or subtleties in cultural norms, is 
often more important in these fields than pure efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps nowhere is this misunderstanding more evident than in the idea of 
"synergy" between "hardware" and "software." In the period leading up to and 
during the Japanese acquisitions of Columbia and MCA, synergy was a buzzword. 
Stock analysts, studio chieftains and corporate strategists incessantly crowed 
about the natural feedback mechanism between software development -- a 
Hollywood strength -- and the electronics hardware manufactured by the likes of 
Sony and Matsushita. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years later, it is virtually impossible to find any real evidence of 
Japanese core-electronics businesses having benefited from Hollywood 
acquisitions. Sony video cameras, for example, are sold to all studios and 
independent producers. No one goes to a Sony Pictures movie expecting to find 
one iota of technical perfection greater than that of any other studio. As one 
Sony executive admitted to the New Yorker magazine, the company had learned 
little from its ownership of Columbia, except that "We see there are up and 
downs in Hollywood." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, Sony and Matsushita's move into Hollywood has not enabled them to 
gain share in any of the conceivable spinoffs -- from special effects and 
animation to multimedia -- of conventional entertainment. Instead, the winners 
have mostly been smaller, California-based upstart firms and a handful of 
independent Japanese game-makers, notably Nintendo and Sega, though they, too, 
are experiencing slower growth in their historic core businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 As the entertainment age unfolds, the siren song of synergy is likely to 
entrap many U.S. competitors as well. During the past year, as the hype 
surrounding the information superhighway has intensified, many U.S. telephone, 
technology and publishing giants have poured billions into 
entertainment-related ventures -- almost always justified by some vague synergy 
between the company's core business and Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, for example, corporate executives -- including those at MCA -- are 
doling out cash and kudos to hyper-hyped Silicon Valley electronics companies, 
like 3DO, while eschewing any fundamental attempt to understand the intricacies 
of the highly fragmented entertainment complex. Lured by the mirage of synergy, 
the large companies continue to miss the basic point: that the real source of 
profits in the "knowledge value" economy are such talents as design and the 
ability to tell a story and develop characters. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1990s, those set up for the biggest fall will be computer software 
mega-stars, like Microsoft's Bill Gates, whose minions are invading Hollywood 
with their own brand of technological determinism. Like the Japanese with their 
financial and industrial ascendancy in the 1980s, the techies think their 
computer-software domination makes them ideally positioned to absorb the 
markets traditionally enjoyed by the Hollywood fantasy factories. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Japanese, their unfortunate foray into Hollywood movie making should 
serve as a warning to keep their distance from industries in which they have no 
expertise. It also exposes, in a dramatic way, the fault lines in the once 
highly touted Japanese management style.

THE NATION; THE SINKING FEELING THAT MAY COST US $100 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jason Berry, Jason Berry, author of Lead Us Not Into Temptation: Catholic 
Priests and the Sexual Abuse of Children, has written extensively on 
environmental issues. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In May, 1992, a security guard at the Strategic Petroleum Reserve on Weeks 
Island, a coastal finger off South Louisiana, walked into sinking soil. He 
pulled himself out, but govern ment officials found themselves in a 
$100-million quagmire. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the estimated cost, according to Department of Energy and reserve 
officials, of relocating 73 million barrels of oil stored in a converted salt 
mine to other sites along the Louisiana-Texas coast. Engineers monitoring 
ground water flow into the chamber, at a rate of 2 gallons a minute, consider 
closure inevitable. Short of that, there is a risk of environmental damage and 
oil loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The department's $100-million mistake throws a spotlight on the sometimes 
sophistry of science and on how government myopically funds projects that 
nature resists. 
</P>
<P>
 Begun after the 1973 Arab oil embargo, the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is a 
$4.5-billion federal program that oversees storage of 750 million barrels of 
oil, a six-week emergency backup in the event of a national supply 
interruption. In 1975, department planners concluded that underground caverns 
located in deep salt domes were the best storage sites. Of the six sites the 
Energy Department bought, Weeks Island stood apart because it had once been a 
salt mine. 
</P>
<P>
 The soil sinkage is actually on land owned by the Morton Salt Company, which 
does commercial mining on most of the island. The Energy Department bought the 
oil-storage site from Morton for $40 million in 1978, building a complex worth 
$222 million today. Morton had an existing system of subterranean chambers and 
corridors that the Strategic Petroleum Reserve simply converted to hold oil. 
Oil is now pushing up, causing a split in the upper ridge that is softened by 
water flowing down. 
</P>
<P>
 Sinkholes aren't unusual in salt mining. Old mine roofs can gradually give 
way, creating stresses in the crystalographic formation. But with petroleum 
stored in a cavity, geologists and engineers have no access to the interior to 
fix the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any structures under ground could be impacted," says Wilma Subra, a chemist 
and environmental activist in New Iberia who has been critical of the the 
reserve. Marshes and wetlands on Weeks Island are "a fragile environment," she 
adds. "Even though all the experts say the salt will maintain its integrity 
when you store (oil) in it, things start to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Concerns about the Strategic Petroleum Reserve began trickling out in a 1984 
report by Sandia, a government research laboratory in Albuquerque, N.M.: "The 
geometry of the Weeks Island salt dome has been defined by Morton based on 
subsurface geophysics and shallow drilling. Dome contours and top-of-salt 
elevations from the shallow drilling were provided to the (Department of 
Energy) in 1977 during the acquisition of the mine, but no attempt has been 
made to verify the dome geometry. In addition, none of the geophysical or 
drilling data used in defining the dome geometry were obtained from Morton 
during any previous investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 "That's pretty risky -- going in and accepting those data . . . with that much 
storage of oil," says Dr. Louis Dellwig, retired professor of geology at 
University of Kansas and a salt-dome expert, when asked about the report. "They 
saved a nickel but it's going to cost them a lot of dimes. I would have thought 
they'd have done their own geophysical work. You drill down and learn where the 
salt is." 
</P>
<P>
 But drilling for subsurface samples to determine dimensions of the salt would 
have been expensive. Or the reserve could have injected water into a cavity, 
flushing out more space. The cheapest route -- conversion of the mine -- led to 
a $100-million hole. 
</P>
<P>
 The reserve's site management at Weeks Island was subcontracted to Boeing 
Petroleum Services, which was criticized for shoddy environmental practices in 
a 1992 internal Department of Energy investigation. The report specifically 
mentioned subsidence rates at Weeks Island and "concern regarding possible salt 
fractures in the vicinity of the shafts, which could, in turn, lead to water 
incursion into the mine." The sinkhole developed several months later. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, with government defense spending waning, Boeing scaled back its 
petroleum operations outside of Seattle and did not rebid for the Weeks Island 
contract. It suffered no penalties for the abundant failures cited by its 
government-check dispenser. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two geologists on the reserve project believe it should continue 
operations. One of them says a Department of Energy pullout reflects "an 
ultraconservative atmosphere. If they wanted to take chances down the road, 
they could continue with the project. . . . But if (they) make a wrong guess 
and there's a major collapse, you're looking at millions of barrels of oil 
flowing to the surface. So they're taking the safest route." 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers are pumping salt water into the sinkhole to reduce its rate of 
collapse, while mapping transfer plans -- by pipe, ship and rail -- of the oil 
to other sites. 
</P>
<P>
 A phase-out decision by Secretary Hazel O'Leary would make Weeks Island the 
second Strategic Petroleum Reserve site decommissioned by her department. In 
1990, the Sulphur Mines site, also in Louisiana, with a 26-million barrel 
capacity, was shut down and sold for $400,000. The Energy Department decided it 
was more cost-effective to store the oil at Big Hill, near Beaumont, Texas. 
Most of the oil at Weeks Island will probably go to Big Hill as well, which has 
the largest storage capacity: 160 million barrels.  
</P>
<P>
 "I guess if there's any lesson here, it's that without good information, it's 
impossible to make decisions that are reliable," says William A. Fontenot, 
community liaison officer for environmental quality in the state attorney 
general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "The history of industrial development in Louisiana is that projects are 
justified after the decision is made to go ahead with them rather than by 
determining upfront what the possible adverse impacts and costs are going to be 
-- the real risks to human health, the environment and the economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the history of defense industries since the Vietnam War is littered 
with boondoggles and cost-overruns. The Strategic Petroleum Reserve's sinkhole 
does not suggest corruption -- just incompetence.

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; SUZAN SHOWN HARJO; FIGHTING TO PRESERVE THE LEGACY 
-- AND FUTURE -- OF NATIVE AMERICANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Gayle Pollard Terry, Gayle Pollard Terry is an editorial writer for The 
Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Native Americans are an invisible minority except around Thanksgiving or when 
a Western hits the big screen. Their numbers are small. The 1990 Census counted 
just under two million -- up from 250,000 at the turn of this century but way 
down from the 50 million who lived here in 1492, the year Christopher Columbus 
"discovered" America. Although integral to the history of this nation, they are 
rarely championed, except for their kindness to the Pilgrims centuries ago. 
They are routinely ridiculed when sports teams take the field. 
</P>
<P>
 The Washington Redskins, Atlanta Braves and Florida State Seminoles are among 
thousands of similarly named professional, college and high-school teams, 
complete with dehumanizing mascots dressed in feathers and war paint. These 
cartoonish caricatures either lead "war cries" or do the Tomahawk Chop. It's 
enough to make one sports-loving Cheyenne woman turn off her TV. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also enough to make Suzan Shown Harjo take her fight to court, and to 
Congress. Harjo, who heads the Washington-based Morning Star Institute, is the 
lead petitioner in a lawsuit filed with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office to 
force the Washington Redskins to change its name, mascot and logo. She also 
works on legislation to protect the rights of America's indigenous people; 
preserve their languages and traditions; reduce their high levels of poverty, 
alcoholism and unemployment, and safeguard their sacred lands. 
</P>
<P>
 An advocate of the arts, Harjo is a founding trustee of the National Museum of 
the American Indian, which opened its first facility last month in New York. 
The main museum will be built in Washington on the Capitol Mall between the 
Botanical Gardens and the Air and Space Museum sometime after the year 2000. 
But Harjo isn't waiting until the next century to get her message out. 
</P>
<P>
 To educate young Americans, she helped develop "Red Thunder," a Native rock 
band, and Indian rock music videos, including "Makoce Wakan: Sacred Earth," a 
special that runs often on VH-1, a cable station. She wrote the lyrics for the 
title song, "Sacred Earth," which was released nationally last week on Eagle 
Thunder Records. 
</P>
<P>
 Harjo, 49, has written poetry since her childhood in rural Oklahoma and 
Naples, Italy, where her father was stationed in the Army with the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization. She worked in radio and theater production in New 
York before moving to Washington 20 years ago to work for the Native American 
Press Assn. news service, which she left to work for the National Congress of 
American Indians. Like most Washingtonians, Harjo also did a stint in 
government. During the Carter Administration, she worked as a congressional 
liaison for Indian affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Morning Star Foundation was founded 10 years ago in memory of her husband 
Frank Ray Harjo, a radio producer. A widow and the mother of two adult 
children, she refuses to be invisible in the nation's Capitol. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Is Thanksgiving a difficult time for you?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Well, no. The spirit of Thanksgiving should be the spirit of all 
people, all the time. As a traditional Indian woman, one thing I'm obliged to 
do is greet the day and end the day with prayers of thanks for everything and 
every being of Mother Earth, not just for the people but for all the creatures 
and beings that live. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I don't have a problem with Thanksgiving as such, if people would go forward 
in that spirit. I do have a problem with some of the stereotypical imaging of 
Native people, which occurs around (Thanksgiving), that continues to keep us in 
the past tense and suggest we are anomalies in the present with no real future. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What kind of stereotypes?  
</P>
<P>
 A: On Thanksgiving, the image is of the benevolent "Noble Savage" giving land, 
giving food, giving a home and shelter to people who presumably on the other 
364 days steal it from the "savage." At least it is a benevolent stereotype, 
but still it is not useful to have anything that is stereotypical or keeps 
people positioned sometime in the last century. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is there no good stereotype?  
</P>
<P>
 A: There is no such thing as a good stereotype. Whether a stereotype is good 
or bad, it still reduces people or a person to a consumable, easily digestible, 
prejudged image or word. It sets up a system of prejudice either for or against 
a person or a people and, in that way, denies the humanity of that person or 
people . . . or it wrongly characterizes people. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you fight stereotypes?  
</P>
<P>
 A: By each person trying to develop their own peace in the world and their own 
respect, then according that to every situation and person they encounter. 
That's everything, from asking people how they wish you to address them to how 
they wish you to behave toward them -- then you just do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you prefer to be characterized? By race or ethnicity?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I want to be known as a Cheyenne woman who is also culturally Muscogee. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: As a group?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I prefer Native people, because we are an indigenous people. Indian is the 
term of art in American law, and it's hard to get away from that. It's the term 
of art in the Constitution. It's flat out wrong, but it is hard to get around 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Some use Native American, but a lot of people consider themselves Native 
American if they aren't first-generation people here, and, of course, we 
predate the Americas by a millennium or so. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 We haven't decided on a collective term. We're trying to get people not to 
call us bad names like "Redskin," a "buck" or a "brave" if you see an Indian 
man. Or if you see an Indian woman, not to call us "maidens" or "squaws." 
That's a word, Algonquin in origin, that means vagina, which the French and 
British started using to refer to all Indian women. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is the status of your suit against the Washington Redskins?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We won an important first round. Pro Football Inc. tried to have the case 
dismissed, but they were struck down by the U.S. Patent and Trade Office this 
year. We were told to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did you try to talk with the owner of the Redskins before filing suit?  
</P>
<P>
 A: When I was the director of the National Congress of American Indians, we 
tried to contact Jack Kent Cooke to meet with us, and he just ignored us, just 
flat out didn't respond. . . . Then along about 1987 or '88, he responded 
through a wire-service story, saying there's not a chance in hell the name is 
going to be changed, because it would cost too much money and the name is not 
derogatory, which is pretty arrogant of him. It's not derogatory to him because 
he's a rich, old white man. He's in another class, other than the offended 
class, so it's not his place to say it's not derogatory. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Have you had more success with college teams?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We have collectively -- I'm a supporter from the sidelines -- in getting 
rid of Little Red from the University of Oklahoma. . . . .The Stanford Indians 
changed their name. The Dartmouth Indians changed their name . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I'm really heartened by a lot of high schools around the country that are 
changing their team names from Indians and Redskins. I was just out in 
Louisville, Ky., at the request of the Jefferson County School Board, to talk 
with students at three high schools that are named after Indians. . . . The 
worst one is the Redskins of Seneca High School. Their mascot is actually drawn 
by Al Cap, who gave them permission to use Lonesome Polecat, a real Little Red 
Sambo image, even worse than Chief Wahoo of the Indians in Cleveland. The 
county directed them to remove all offensive mascots and images and names . . . 
by Dec. 31. That is a really good sign of America growing up and shining a 
light on racism. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why is this important?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It's awfully important to clear away this underbrush of stereotypical 
images and cartoonish portrayals of us so that we can protect our images . . .  
</P>
<P>
 It would be wonderful to have big- budget films actually done by Indians, not 
just Indians as the scouts, as we've seen in this modern crop of movies, but 
Indians as the directors, the producers and in the premier spots -- Indians in 
the lead roles -- not as the sidekick in a Lone Ranger and Tonto relationship, 
Native people actually portraying what it is they wish to portray about 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What movies would you single out?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Hollywood seems to go through stages . . . Despite the fact they used a lot 
of Lakota people throughout "Dances With Wolves," it still says, at the end of 
the movie, that's the end of the Sioux Nation in the 1890s. For heavens sakes! 
The Sioux Nation is the third-largest Indian nation by population in the U.S. 
</P>
<P>
 You can see that in "Cheyenne Autumn." The two Geronimo movies declared the 
Apaches dead, buried and gone at the end of the last century. . . . You can see 
that in the "The Last of the Mohicans." When the punch line is the people died 
a long time ago, the message is, say a prayer for the dead and wring your 
hands, and not that there is something that can be accomplished in this time 
and someone has any responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's wrong with these portrayals?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The longer I work in public policy, the more important I see this issue of 
telling our own stories, because members of Congress are no different than the 
rest of Americans in having these stereotypes about Native people. Public 
policy is not done in any positive way for cartoons, or for people who are 
already dead, or people who don't have a future . . .  
</P>
<P>
 There is a whole different language about us. We don't eat corn -- we eat 
maize. We don't walk, skip or jump -- we roam. We don't have music or songs -- 
we have chants. We don't have church services -- we have rites. All that 
suggests we are either not here or we are so different that we don't fit any 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Can you think of any positive portrayals in movies or television?  
</P>
<P>
 A: "Northern Exposure" does a great job. Each of the Native people is a 
distinctive person and has their own level of cultural intrigue. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Penn did a good job in "Little Big Man," for the most part. He got a 
whole lot of stuff right. His massacre scene was excellent. It was about one 
small child and how it might affect that individual, and the pony screaming and 
how everything seemed suspended in time . . . and how legends grow from 
historical fact to tall tale. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Costner, in "Dances With Wolves," got the kids right. He took little 
kids beyond the baby-seal stage, which is how Native children are usually 
portrayed. He has little boy-kids laughing, playing . . . They were doing 
things that kids do, and kids are the same, no matter what color, or what 
culture or what side of the border. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of "Thunderheart" was good. It had some nice touches about Indian humor 
and how our elders aren't just revered because they have magic. They are 
revered because they make you laugh, they make you see the world in a different 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with most of these movies is they are still about the 
good-hearted, good-looking white guy. The stories are secondarily about 
Indians. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I understand that white people make the movies, and it's not going to be a 
movie about someone but themselves. That's why more of our people have to get 
into the writing and directing and producing end. It's not that all Native 
people are going to like what one Indian director does, or even 20 Indian 
directors, but at least it will be an authentic voice, first-person, instead of 
about us. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you make authentic images popular?  
</P>
<P>
 A: There's a difference between what's good and what's popular. . . . There is 
an audience who doesn't want to be challenged, doesn't care if it's authentic, 
that usually wants something that reinforces their own prejudices and 
stereotypes and maybe wouldn't recognize an authentic voice if they heard it or 
an authentic image if they saw it. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Schindler's List" could not have been made by someone who is not Jewish and 
does not have the sensibilities of Steven Spielberg. If Oliver Stone had not 
been in Vietnam, how could he do his Vietnam movies? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why do you do what you do?

That's really how I define myself. I'm a mother.

SUPERPOWERDOM: IS IT THE MANTLE AMERICA NEEDS TO WEAR?; ANSWER IS YES, BUT IN 
THE POST-COLD WAR ERA THERE CAN BE NO REAL LEADERSHIP WITHOUT CONSISTENCY AND 
NO CONSISTENCY WITHOUT LEADERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just a few years ago the United States was enjoying what surely must be 
counted as among its most remarkable foreign policy achievements of the last 
200 years, and its political leaders were proudly proclaiming America's new 
post-Cold War status as the world's only superpower. That claim is seldom heard 
anymore, at least on an official level. Superpowerdom, it seems, is now 
perceived not so much as something to boast about as a burden to bear. 
</P>
<P>
 True, the United States, by virtue of its still formidable military strength, 
its massive economy and the complex web of trade, commercial, diplomatic and 
security ties it has spun around the world, unquestionably remains the dominant 
international power. True, also, that much of the world continues to insist 
that the United States lead in moments of international crisis or distress, and 
often seems prone to sink into a kind of stuporous inertia if Washington passes 
on the opportunity to do so. The leadership role has by no means been 
abdicated. But Americans are also clearly in no hurry to undertake new 
adventures or responsibilities abroad. NEO-ISOLATIONIST VOICES AREN'T REACHING 
MANY 
</P>
<P>
 There are few signs at the same time that Americans in any significant numbers 
are being attracted to isolationism, though neo-isolationist voices at both 
extremes of the political spectrum are being raised. Instead Americans not 
unreasonably want to hear their political leaders make a convincing case that 
accepting any new international obligation in fact serves their country's 
interests, foremost of which are protecting its security and furthering its 
economic well-being. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout most of its history the Cold War took precedence when it came to 
apportioning the nation's resources and making choices about what the United 
States should do abroad. Now priorities have been largely reordered. 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Rostow, economist and former presidential security adviser, probably 
speaks for most Americans when he says, "If we wish to have increased influence 
in the world we must first regain our international competitiveness and show an 
ability to pay our own way." Samuel P. Huntington of Harvard's Institute for 
Strategic Studies agrees: "The consequence of a failure to renew our economy is 
a decline in our relative (global) power." OLD DEBATE: THE 'REALISTS' VERSUS 
THE 'IDEALISTS' 
</P>
<P>
 At the academic level today, if not yet very loudly in the political arena, 
the old debate between foreign policy "realists" and "idealists" simmers on. 
</P>
<P>
 As David Callahan defines the issues in his book "Between Two Worlds," the 
argument is between those who would pretty much maintain the U.S. global 
outlook of the last half-century, with its emphasis on national strength to 
promote international stability, and those who call for "more ambitious U.S. 
initiatives for promoting democracy, sustainable development and collective 
security," all to be funded out of sharply reduced defense spending. 
</P>
<P>
 In the real world in which policy-makers must try to find their way such an 
either-or approach is of little practical use. An effective foreign policy has 
no choice but to deal with the world as it is rather than as theorists would 
like it to be.  
</P>
<P>
 At the same time a foreign policy that ignores basic American values is 
morally as well as politically unsustainable. Even a rigorously "realistic" 
approach to the world must maintain an active commitment to human rights and 
support for fledgling democracies. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue is one of emphasis. Graham Fuller, a senior political scientist at 
RAND, argues that "creating a community of like-minded states should be the 
underlying principle that drives most of our foreign policy," since "it is a 
matter of historical fact that democratic states do not fight each other." 
</P>
<P>
 Expanding the world's democracies and encouraging the growth of market 
economies -- stated goals of the Clinton Administration -- are noble 
objectives. But in a world composed of vastly different cultures with their own 
particular notions of how society should be organized, how effectively can U.S. 
policy pursue these goals? 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Gelb, president of the Council on Foreign Relations, notes that "most 
Americans now understand that democracy is a state of grace not readily 
attained and not within their power to impose. Nor are they eager to expend 
lives and resources to transform sinkholes into free enterprise paradises." 
Edward Luttwak, president of the Center for Strategic and International 
Studies, is equally blunt: "States require a cultural basis for democracy, and 
if they do not have it, it is nonsense to suppose that the United States can 
create or sustain such an atmosphere." STABILITY AS THE PRIME AIM OF FOREIGN 
POLICY 
</P>
<P>
 None of this means the United States should forget about trying to promote its 
most basic values, only that its ability to do so must be weighed 
pragmatically. Princeton's Richard Falk is one of those who believes that "the 
primary aim of U.S. policy should be to maintain stability. Efforts to build 
democracy and protect human rights, while valid, must remain peripheral." 
Moreover, recalling the Clinton Administration's dismal and humiliating retreat 
on its China policy, "we should reject any linkage between access to U.S. 
markets and human rights performance by specific states." ECONOMIC 
LIBERALIZATION, POLITICAL LIBERALIZATION 
</P>
<P>
 Graham Fuller agrees, at least in part: "The causal relationship between 
economic and political liberalization is sufficiently complex that we should 
consider striving for the former instead of the latter in certain cases, as 
with China . . . some double standards (in trying to promote American values) 
are inevitable." 
</P>
<P>
 Double standards are hardly novel in international relations. Our government, 
for example, routinely deplores abuses of human rights in, say, Iran, an 
antagonist, while keeping mum about the absence of many freedoms in, say, Saudi 
Arabia, a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Most governments, doing the same thing themselves, tend to overlook such 
inconsistencies. But foreign governments, especially unfriendly ones, can be 
brutally unforgiving when Washington's approach to larger issues is seen to be 
marked by uncertainties, confusion or inconstancy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bush Administration gave Saddam Hussein good reason for misreading 
American intentions before he invaded Kuwait. Similarly the Clinton 
Administration's record of strong words but weak actions in regard to Bosnia, 
Somalia, North Korea and Haiti at best can be seen to have invited 
international confusion and derision. At worst it invites a dangerous testing 
of U.S. will. 
</P>
<P>
 Inconsistency or instability is punished in world politics, warns Edward 
Luttwak. What the United States needs, he says, is "a policy that maximizes its 
credibility and minimizes our need to actually intervene." Often, he adds, "the 
message an action or inaction sends is even more important than the policy 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
 By its very nature, the long and sometimes perilous competition with 
Soviet-led communism elicited a host of U.S. commitments around the world, some 
of which it's clear now had only the most marginal connection with real 
national interests. That era has ended. But precisely because it seeks a stable 
world in which its own and other economies can flourish and where humane values 
can be advanced, the United States is destined to remain deeply involved in 
world affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 What should the nation's strategic priorities be? There's broad agreement that 
domestic economic renewal must be at the top of the list, for without a 
vigorous economy U.S. influence and credibility seem sure to decline. Political 
influence and diplomatic influence are not, of course, always effective in 
deterring threats to peace and security. That's why it's essential that 
adequate American military power be maintained, with particular priority given 
to high-tech "smart" weapons and an ability to move rapidly. But direct U.S. 
military engagement should be undertaken only when strategic interests clearly 
demand it. The Persian Gulf War, with its threat to world oil supplies, was 
such a case; Somalia and Bosnia are not. A WELL-ARTICULATED POLICY BACKED BY 
REAL DEEDS 
</P>
<P>
 Since indecision and imprecision among policy-makers so clearly weaken 
America's political, diplomatic and moral standing, consistency in stating and 
carrying out strategic policies is vital. The President and his top officials 
must be prepared to put deeds -- and, if need be, military power -- behind 
their words. That could require acting unilaterally when national interests 
warrant doing so. More often, it will likely mean participating as part of a 
larger collective effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "Multilateralism, for good or ill, almost always requiring American 
leadership, has descended on the world," notes Leslie Gelb. The key words in 
that sentence are American leadership. Can it rise to the myriad and largely 
unforeseen challenges that the post-Cold War world presents?

 * You still don't get it, do you? I am referring to the Nov. 18 editorial 
about the proposal in Stockton to issue concealed weapons to citizens of that 
city. (The City Council rejected the measure on Nov. 21.) 
</P>
<P>
 What could be wrong with that? The state of Florida has had such a law on the 
books for several years now, and the state of Tennessee has recently passed the 
same kind of law. 
</P>
<P>
 Has there been an increase in gunplay in those states? Hardly. Is it a 
coincidence that it was foreign tourists in Florida who were the targets of 
robberies and murders recently? I don't think so. 
</P>
<P>
 I am a police officer and have been for several years. The threat to my fellow 
officers and me is from guns being carried illegally by criminals, not by 
otherwise law-abiding citizens for their own protection. 
</P>
<P>
 I do agree that there should be some training before a person is given such a 
permit, along with the proposed criteria in Stockton. There are those who 
shouldn't be anywhere near a gun, as well those who don't know how to safely 
handle a gun.

 "Give everyone a gun and run for cover, fast" your sub-headline says; give me 
a break. To begin, the average citizen in Stockton, or any city, would not have 
the desire to carry a firearm with them. The City Council's proposal would 
allow law-abiding citizens the option to do so. The state of Florida has the 
same basic measure and approximately 2% have obtained a CCW permit. Of those, 
many carry their firearms only as a precaution when working late and alone, 
traveling in unfamiliar areas, or for protection of their family. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe that a safety training program should be included with the measure 
that would involve firearms handling, target practice and children's safety. 
National Rifle Assn. members are very well-versed on firearm ownership and 
safety. Many members, including myself, would be more than willing to provide 
instruction.

 Law-abiding firearms owners are fed up with the near-constant chiseling away 
of our rights. We showed our anger in the Nov. 8 election. According to exit 
polls, roughly 70% of gun owners voted Republican. It's logical to conclude 
that we decided to punish those who voted for the Clinton crime bill by 
throwing them out of office. 
</P>
<P>
 Your Nov. 14 editorial, in which you once again trotted out a photo of 
wheelchair-bound James Brady, repeats the tired mantra of blaming firearms for 
this nation's crime problem. Further, you continue to decry ownership of 
"assault weapons" even though they differ from other legal firearms only in 
appearance. I realize that Democratic President Clinton will likely veto any 
attempt to repeal the "assault weapon" ban and the Brady bill. This makes it 
even more imperative to elect a pro-Second Amendment Republican to the White 
House in 1996.

TRADE DEFICIT, GATT PASSAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Trade Deficit Grows, Dealing Setback to GATT," Nov. 19: 
</P>
<P>
 The opponents of GATT would have us believe that the solution to our large 
trade deficit and the loss of manufacturing jobs to other countries is to block 
changes in existing world trade policy. The only logical interpretation of 
their arguments is that they really want jobs to move overseas and really want 
the United States to maintain a large trade deficit. While GATT does have 
problems, it will have a much smaller impact on U.S. imports than on U.S. 
exports, since most U.S. tariffs are already low.

<P>
 Last month's $10 billion trade deficit brings to our attention once again the 
disastrous course being followed by the U.S. in allowing this condition to 
continue year after year. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously our trading partners do not want to buy as much from us as they sell 
to us. The Japanese, for example, have stonewalled every attempt that we have 
made to even out our trade with them. To whose advantage is this? Last month we 
bought $10 billion worth more than we sold. How do we pay for this difference? 
There is only one way. We pay with stock, bonds, real estate, factories. The 
time will come when they will live on the dividends from American companies, 
from rent on the homes we live in, from interest on what we owe them. We will 
pay them rent to live in our own country. Free trade is great. But it must be 
fair trade as well. Fair trade is -- you buy as much from me as I buy from you, 
and if it's not fair trade we are better off without it.

 The Clinton Administration has a new treaty, essentially to put Americans out 
of work. This treaty is to lower taxes on all imports. 
</P>
<P>
 It is very nice, and quite convenient for consumers, but what about the 
hard-working U.S. citizens who make American products? There will be a loss of 
jobs. We Americans work hard for our money. If this treaty passes, the people 
of America will buy more foreign products. And that's definitely not what we 
need. Foreign may be cheaper, but American products are built better and last 
longer.

 Make no mistake: As a Libertarian, I support free trade as a win-win for us 
and our trading partners. And GATT sounds like the way to go. But the devil, as 
they say, is in the details. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider: GATT is more than 20,000 pages long; the implementing legislation 
that Congress is, in theory, considering, more than 4,000. We need a deliberate 
and thoughtful debate on this treaty. We can't get that in a hurry-up, 
lame-duck legislative session. There won't even be time for congressional staff 
wonks to read this legislation, let alone our elected representatives. GATT 
real!

DEANE DANA

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We read with great interest your article regarding the retirement of 
Supervisor Deane Dana (Nov. 15). 
</P>
<P>
 Among the numerous accomplishments during Supervisor Dana's distinguished 
career were the protection and preservation of Los Angeles County's Ocean 
Lifeguards. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the leadership and vision of Supervisor Dana and his chief deputy, Don 
Knabe, the world's premier ocean lifeguard service was merged into the Los 
Angeles County Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 This merger came at a time when the citizens of the county were in danger of 
losing their lifeguards due to financial and political strains. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year 60 million people visit the Los Angeles County beaches and Los 
Angeles County lifeguards save over 10,000 lives in ocean rescues. Thanks to 
Supervisor Dana, the people of Los Angeles County can continue to enjoy their 
precious beaches secure in the knowledge that the Los Angeles County lifeguards 
will be there to make sure that all who come out to the beach enjoy their day 
and go home safe and alive.

 Re "In Defense of a Noble Calling," Commentary, Nov. 17: 
</P>
<P>
 While the requirements to become a notary in Iowa and elsewhere are relatively 
-- and perhaps even humorously -- few, one requirement has proven 
insurmountable to many persons with multiple college degrees: demonstrable 
integrity. Indeed in California, notary commission applicants must submit 
fingerprints and undergo a thorough background check. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the integrity and the impartiality of notaries that are keystones of 
modern commerce and law. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the notary screening signers for identity, willingness and basic 
competence, our courts would quickly clog with challenges to signatures on 
property deeds that were forged, coerced or incompetently made. Notaries 
protect us, our homes and our property from title fraud. They are easy to 
deride but every civilized nation sees a need for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Gilbert Cranberg, I'm sure, is grateful that there are notaries in Iowa 
to prevent a forger from creating a phony deed on his house and clouding his 
title.

PERSPECTIVE ON RESEARCH; A BRAVE NEW WORLD IS HATCHED; AN NIH PLAN WOULD CREATE 
HUMAN BEINGS FOR STUDY AND EXPERIMENTATION, AND THEN DISPOSE OF THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE WEIGEL, George Weigel is the president of the Ethics and Public 
Policy Center in Washington. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the beginning of Aldous Huxley's classic novel, as at the entrance to the 
brave new world it depicts, there is the "Central London Hatchery and 
Conditioning Centre." In a "squat gray building," 300 technicians bend over 
their microscopes, managing the process of human reproduction. The technicians 
inspect human eggs, then immerse them in a "warm bouillon containing 
free-swimming spermatozoa." The fertilized eggs -- human embryos -- are then 
incubated until they are ripe for bottling and development. 
</P>
<P>
 The suburban campus of the National Institutes of Health, just outside 
Washington, is a handsome park; there are no ugly, squat, gray buildings to mar 
the sylvan landscape. But what the NIH proposes to undertake is nothing less 
than the creation of a real-life American analogue to Huxley's Central London 
Hatchery. For, later this week, the advisory committee to the director of NIH 
will consider and almost certainly adopt the recommendation of the NIH Human 
Embryo Research Panel that the federal government sponsor and fund the 
laboratory creation of human embryos as research materials for experimentation. 
</P>
<P>
 This research, the panel alleges, will have all sorts of benefits: reversing 
infertility, enabling us to make more perfect babies, even contributing to the 
fight against cancer. Other scientists disagree that the potential payoff is 
that considerable. But even if the scientific benefits were as great as the NIH 
panel claims, the burning question would remain: Is it ever morally acceptable 
to create human lives for research experimentation that will, inevitably, 
destroy them? 
</P>
<P>
 Most people instinctively recoil in shock and disgust, even horror, from such 
a proposal. That reaction should be encouraged, not deplored. It bespeaks not 
scientific illiteracy but moral common sense. High school English students find 
Huxley's fictional future frightening because, in it, men and women have been 
thoroughly instrumentalized, made into means for someone else's ends. Yet that 
is precisely what the NIH proposes to sponsor, using taxpayer funds to pay the 
freight. 
</P>
<P>
 scientists will be creating, manipulating and then destroying "developing 
human life" that deserves "serious moral consideration." 
</P>
<P>
 But evidently not too much consideration, for this human life, the panel 
argues, lacks "personhood." Personhood, according to panel member Ronald Green 
of Dartmouth, is not a set of "qualities existing out there" but something that 
"we" bestow on a human creature. Whether someone is too old, too young, too 
burdensome or too useless to be afforded the protections given to persons is 
something that "we" decide, on the basis of enlightened self-interest. 
"Personhood" is not an inherent quality of human beings; "personhood," on 
Green's analysis, is a "social construct." 
</P>
<P>
 We have been down this grim road before. The 20th Century is replete with 
examples of what happens when one group (or caste or race or party) declares 
itself to be the vanguard to whose superior purposes others must bend, even to 
the point of their extermination. 
</P>
<P>
 The great slaughters of our era -- of Jews, Gypsies, Polish intellectuals, 
Ukrainian kulaks, Armenians, bourgeois Chinese, Hutus, Tutsis -- all took place 
when the humanity of indisputably human beings was denied by powerful others, 
who were acting, so they thought, on sound scientific or philosophical or 
eugenic or theological or political principle. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some things that should never be done by anyone, under any 
circumstances, for any reason, in aid of any possible benefit. One would have 
thought that, in the wake of Nazi quackery, the exploitation of human beings as 
research material would be understood as one of those things. But now the NIH 
Human Embryo Research Panel proposes to go a step further by deliberately 
creating human lives whose only prospect is to serve as disposable research 
material.  
</P>
<P>
 In so doing, the panel endorses a direct violation of the Nuremberg Code, 
which, inspired by Dr. Josef Mengele, unambiguously declared that "no 
experiment should be conducted where there is . . . reason to believe that 
death or disabling injury will occur." 
</P>
<P>
 The use of human beings for experiments that will harm them and to which they 
have not consented should be prohibited by law. So should the technological 
production of innocent human beings as research materials. Congress must act; 
the NIH, alas, seems incapable of recognizing either scientific hubris or crude 
utilitarianism masquerading as moral reason.

A PRAYER FOR THE SEASON OF MIRACLES; HANUKKAH: WOULDN'T IT BE WONDERFUL IF ALL 
THE GUNS COULD BE CONVERTED INTO MENORAHS,GIVERS OF LIGHT?

 Every day in California, another innocent person is maimed or killed in a 
senseless shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of violent deaths by guns is frightening. A report from Atlanta's 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention states that from 1988 to 1990, half 
of the homicides and about two-thirds of suicides occurred in private homes. Of 
those homes, 43% had guns in them. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest tragedy was reported in Louisiana. Parents arrived home and 
discovered a noise in a closet. The father went for his gun and mistakenly shot 
his 14-year-old daughter to death. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember living 35 years ago in a quiet area of Brooklyn. Holdups, robberies 
and rapes were nonexistent. One year, tragedy struck, destroying our quiet 
neighborhood. It happened around Hanukkah. 
</P>
<P>
 My teen-age cousin escaped from Europe during World War II and convinced the 
Navy recruiter of his readiness to fight the enemy. "Hitler isn't only the 
enemy of the Jews; he is the enemy of all democracy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, he worked producing ammunition for rifles, guns and other 
weapons of destruction -- also belt buckles for the U.S. military. His favorite 
line was, "Without me, men can't go to war; their pants would fall down." 
</P>
<P>
 One of his sons worked in a drugstore, helping the pharmacist with deliveries 
and general upkeep. Late one night, a hoodlum came into the shop demanding 
drugs. Before the pharmacist could get him the drugs, the hoodlum panicked and 
shot my cousin's son in cold blood. I thought the family would never recover 
from this tremendous loss. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent shopping trip to New York I came across all kinds of menorahs. 
Some were made of silver; others were ceramic and others were made of tin. One 
was remarkable. It was a wide piece of metal on a unique stand with places for 
the eight candles. Taking a closer look at it, I was struck that the candle 
holders were made from a heavy copper. Examining further, I saw that the candle 
holders were the shells from M14s. The base of the menorah was one of those 
anti-aircraft shells that are used to pierce armor. Here, finally, objects of 
weaponry were transformed into an object of harmony and hope. I wondered, who 
could have produced such a menorah? 
</P>
<P>
 I was determined to buy it, but it was not for sale. This menorah was to be a 
lesson for the gun dealers and the gang members. The very same machinery that 
produced weapons was now producing candle holders and menorahs, bringing light 
and happiness to the world. As you may have guessed, this menorah was created 
by my cousin, the father of the murdered boy. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting tonight, Jewish people will celebrate Hanukkah, the festival of 
lights. 
</P>
<P>
 The lighting of the menorah commemorates the event of the temple's 
rededication by the Jewish priests, called Kohanim, 2,100 years ago. When 
lighting the menorah with a one-day supply of oil, it miraculously burned for 
eight days. 
</P>
<P>
 If only we could change all the guns into menorahs, what a miraculous and 
bright Hanukkah we would all have.

COLUMN LEFT / ROBERT SCHEER: LET'S LOOK AT THE REAL NEWT GINGRICH; HIS 
HYPOCRISY AND HIS DELIBERATE MISREADING OF HISTORY ARE DETRIMENTS TO 
LEADERSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT SCHEER, Robert Scheer is a former Times national correspondent.

<TEXT>
<P>
 What do we really know about Newt Gingrich, soon to be third in line for the 
presidency, other than that he has been immensely successful in a 
long-festering plan to gain power: "I have an ambition. I want to shift the 
entire planet," he told the Washington Post eight years ago. Now he has the 
power, but who is he and what is he after?  
</P>
<P>
 The media have basically accepted him on his own terms as a righteous champion 
of family values determined to do battle with the "counterculture" and big 
government in Washington. Yet here is a professional politician who walked out 
on his own family with two young children at a time when his wife had cancer. 
Those kids were the basis of this super-patriot's draft deferment during the 
Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 He talks endlessly about self-reliance and local initiative, but he represents 
Cobb County, an affluent white-flight suburb of Atlanta that is the 
third-largest recipient of federal funds of any suburb in the nation -- 57% 
over the national average. Cobb County wouldn't even exist as an economic 
powerhouse had not the federal government decided to make it a major interstate 
highway crossing point. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich loves to beat up on welfare mothers, who he claims are ripping off 
the taxpayers, but his district is a perfect example of the welfare state for 
the rich. The biggest employer, the engine that drove the county's rapid 
development, was Lockheed, a mega-recipient of defense contracts. He even 
lobbied the feds to approve the sale of Lockheed's jets to Moammar Kadafi in 
Libya. 
</P>
<P>
 So he's a hypocrite; what else is new? It's the total disconnect from reality, 
the search for simplistic solutions and easy scapegoats. That and the venom. At 
a time when the nation faces serious problems, here is a major leader who 
insists that he alone has the answers, and that his chief opponent, the 
President of the United States, is a captive of a suspect "counterculture."  
</P>
<P>
 He fueled the Nov. 8 Republican sweep by denigrating the President as "the 
enemy of normal Americans," and held him and his party responsible for 
virtually every crime committed. 
</P>
<P>
 When Susan Smith confessed to drowning her two children in a South Carolina 
lake, Gingrich was quick to blame the Democrats. "I think that the mother 
killing the two children in South Carolina vividly reminds every American how 
sick the society is getting and how much we need to change things. . . . The 
only way to change is to vote Republican." 
</P>
<P>
 It is absurd to insist, as he does in almost every speech, that the world was 
just peachy until the civil-rights era and its Great Society programs ushered 
in by Lyndon Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the big lie technique. For the representative of a county in which the 
KKK long held sway to suggest that things started to go wrong in his South only 
in the 1960s, when civil-rights workers broke a pattern of centuries of slavery 
and segregation, is to stand history on its head with a vengeance. The youth 
rebellion of the '60s began with the civil-rights movement, and thanks to the 
heroism of those freedom riders, a new South was born.  
</P>
<P>
 Nor did the '60s counterculture cause the breakup of the American family, as 
Gingrich argues. He himself was the product of a teen-age mother and a broken 
home in the good old days of the 1940s. Nor was it the hippies who drove 
Gingrich into the wild life during the stormy 10 years of his own failed 
marriage, as well-documented in a 1984 article in Mother Jones magazine. That 
article makes Bill Clinton, who is still married and in a nuclear family, seem 
like a Boy Scout in comparison. The details of the Mother Jones expose were 
supplied by many once-close associates and confirmed by Gingrich's first wife. 
But why take her word for it? She's no Gennifer Flowers, she's just the 
ex-wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich's holier-than-thou attacks on liberals -- "the counterculture" -- 
reeks of McCarthyism, which appeals during times of serious economic trouble. 
In uncertain times, the mass of people, who have come to accept prosperity as 
their birthright, are prone to this siren song. Right-wing extremism depends on 
two ingredients -- nostalgia for a storybook past and the conjuring up of a 
scapegoat whom you blame for desecrating that paradise.  
</P>
<P>
 There is much to debate about the proper role of government, reforming welfare 
for the rich as well as the poor and retooling management and labor to be 
effective in a dramatically changed international economy. But instead of 
facing our real problems, Gingrich and his followers would lead us on a mad 
hunt for scapegoats in an attempt to restore the good old days that never 
existed.

A CITY WORKER PROTECTION THAT MAY HAVE OUTLIVED ITS USEFULNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Xandra Kayden, Xandra Kayden, a political scientist, is writing a book on 
the political structure of Los Angeles. She is author of Surviving Power (Free 
Press). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Riordan Administration wants to tighten its control over the managers of 
the city's bureaucracy in a city unaccustomed to serious executive management. 
A safe prediction: One man's sense of managerial accounta bility will be 
another man's political interference. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's new directive, in effect, attempts to make the mayor's 
office the gatekeeper for city-department business. In reporting to the City 
Council, general managers are asked to go through the mayor's office, which 
will decide if the city's Chief Administrative Officer should get into the act. 
Previously, the CAO was obliged to file a report on every matter of city 
business, thus slowing down governance. 
</P>
<P>
 The streamlining directive will probably stick until someone decides the City 
Council needs to know directly. But if the Administration truly seeks to 
aggressively manage Los Angeles government, it will need a better understanding 
of what is, and what is not, an appropriate balance of power in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent flap over the demotion of the Los Angeles Police Department's No. 2 
chief, Bernard C. Parks, illustrates the tension between accountability and 
interference. Few doubt the challenges that Police Chief Willie L. Williams 
faces in reshaping his department along the lines recommended by the 
Christopher commission and in building up his force. Foremost among them is 
that he is accountable, because of Proposition F, to a mayor who wants a bigger 
and more efficient LAPD, while the officers -- and principal carriers of the 
department's culture -- who will implement the reforms and hire the officers 
are not. They are protected by civil service. 
</P>
<P>
 Management, under such circumstances, is a delicate business, at best. And any 
pressure for change -- as Richard Riordan and the City Council exerted in the 
Parks' case -- that is perceived to be coming from outside the LAPD will be 
viewed as a hostile act of interference. 
</P>
<P>
 This question of managerial control -- or political interference -- extends to 
the entire city work force. Because of civil service, no public official in the 
city can wave a big stick and expect compliance, because no official has the 
necessary responsibility for which he or she is being held accountable: They 
cannot offer much in the way of rewards, and they certainly cannot fire 
subordinates. It is not even unknown for their subordinates to make as much or 
more than they do. This is a critical difference between public and private 
management. 
</P>
<P>
 From the perspective of elected officials, the city's departments seem to roll 
on inexorably, controlled by their own employee contracts and inner cultures. 
We assume the mayor is in charge, but his legal authority is extremely limited. 
The general managers do not form the mayor's Cabinet. They may be hired by him 
if a vacancy occurs, but he cannot fire them. 
</P>
<P>
 The seat of government is the City Council, but even it has limited authority 
over city departments. Term limits have amplified the power imbalance, because 
elected officials have only eight years to demonstrate their leadership 
abilities, while general managers can hang around for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe we could get by if there were someone to motivate general managers and 
city employees, help them feel more a part of an important undertaking. But 
managers have not had a raise in years, department budgets are continually 
slashed and years of a job freeze and attrition have cost the city its most 
promising employees and a great deal in morale. Riordan, while personally 
popular, came into office with a staff determined to make the city conform to 
the standards of the private sector. In turn, his staff, with few exceptions, 
has struck the city's work force as arrogant and inexperienced in public 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although recognizing the need to improve, the Administration would be better 
served if its staff were a little more respectful and trusting, particularly 
since they do not have the authority to act otherwise. Ironically, it is the 
council that is taking the lead in addressing management in a more open and 
appropriate form. Councilmen Marvin Braude and Mark Ridley-Thomas are seeking 
to put a Charter reform measure on the April ballot that would provide for the 
removal of general managers by the mayor and a vote of eight council members. 
</P>
<P>
 Asking who is accountable to whom, and how accountability should be allocated 
in city government, are fair questions. In finding answers, we should rethink 
the rationale for civil-service protection, particularly at the managerial 
level. The need for job security in the public sector today is not the same as 
it was 100 years ago. There are safeguards in the law that did not exist then. 
</P>
<P>
 But whatever conclusions we reach, we should consider them in the broader 
context of changing the rules, not by trying to assert authority that lacks the 
tools of ensuring obedience. Every mayor in recent memory tried to do it by 
fiat, and each one failed. If Riordan wants to leave the government in better 
shape than he found it, his only option is to support the council's Charter 
reform.

NEW YORK'S PACIFIC RIM SHOT; THREE NEW YORK ART GIANTS HAVE ANNOUNCED PLANS FOR

 The New Yorkers are coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Look at their arrival as an alluring form of cultural imperialism -- New York, 
the motherland of the art world, is invading its brassier aesthetic cousin, 
Hollywood. Two of New York's most important galleries and a top auction house 
are making a play for some of the excess capital floating around town. And one 
bi-coastal view holds that their much-heralded arrival signals a new optimistic 
phase for Los Angeles' beleaguered art market. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a support base for a new resurgence of gallery activity in Los 
Angeles," says Museum of Contemporary Art Director Richard Koshalek. "I see it 
in (the new Santa Monica gallery complex) Bergamot Station. I see it in the new 
interest from galleries outside of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an extremely good moment if you're in the art world to be in Los 
Angeles, whether you're a museum person, you're a collector, you're an artist 
or you're a dealer, and I think that's only going to improve in the next 
several years. We're moving into the '90s, so there's a greater caution, but 
there is a strong positive feeling about the arts in Southern California." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, New York art powerhouses PaceWildenstein and Gagosian Gallery are 
banking on the prospect of Southern Californians and Pacific Rim visitors 
transcending their Armani shopping ways and behaving like the dedicated 
Manhattan art crowd. Both galleries have announced plans for grand Camden Drive 
spaces to be designed by two of the country's preeminent architects -- for 
Pace-Wildenstein, Charles Gwathmey, who designed a major addition to New York's 
Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, and for Gagosian, Richard Meier, the architect 
behind the new Getty Center in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 The news of those openings next year -- coupled with Sotheby's announcement 
that the New York- and London-based auction house will open a 
13,000-square-foot auction space at Wilshire Boulevard and Bedford Drive next 
spring -- has observers trumpeting Beverly Hills as the next center for the 
city's high-end art market. But the New York contingent says the implications 
for Los Angeles, which has suffered the slings and arrows of a sharp economic 
downtown, are far more dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 "The feeling is that Los Angeles, more than any other city in America, is 
poised to benefit from the coming economic recovery due to its position on the 
Pacific Rim and its growing cultural institutions, and we want to be part of 
that," says Marc Selwyn, PaceWildenstein's newly appointed West Coast head and 
formerly Sotheby's West Coast director of fine arts for four years. "We have a 
lot of confidence in Los Angeles as a city and as a cultural center." 
</P>
<P>
 But some longtime Los Angeles art world denizens question the New Yorkers' 
view of their universe, particularly the assumption that the entertainment 
industry will spend its big money on big-ticket art. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is that L.A. is a very difficult town," says veteran gallery owner 
Margo Leavin, who shows artists based in and outside California. "It's not a 
town of collectors. And there's too much competition from the physical beauty 
of the city itself, and second cars and homes. There isn't the same need for 
art as in major cities, like Chicago and New York, where you need it to 
survive." 
</P>
<P>
 Sotheby's is banking on Angelenos and tourists here surviving in style. The 
auction house put its finger to the wind, or rather the gale, of reaction to 
its print sale at the Regent Beverly Wilshire last March, the first since 
Sotheby's closed its auction space on Beverly Boulevard a dozen years ago. The 
sale grossed $1.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very encouraged," says Andrea Van de Kamp, senior vice president and 
managing director of Sotheby's West Coast operations. "Over 300 people showed 
up that night, and when we announced the first (print) sale in 12 years in Los 
Angeles, the audience applauded. It's a nice sign for the art community of Los 
Angeles that we're all interested in being here and being active and around." 
</P>
<P>
 An October print sale was far from torrential, however. Only 197 of the 351 
lots offered found buyers, a relatively meager showing. But Van de Kamp 
stripped the market of blame, pointing instead to inadequate pre-sale 
publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 "One sale that is mediocre is not going to determine (our course)," she said. 
"We're committed to this for a minimum of three years." Another print sale is 
planned for next October. 
</P>
<P>
 In turn, PaceWildenstein, New York's premier gallery for blue- chip modern and 
contemporary artists and 19th-Century Impressionists and old masters, promises 
to do its part to stoke the city's cultural fires. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to be developing an extraordinary exhibition schedule that's 
unprecedented in Los Angeles," Selwyn says. "There hasn't been a major Rothko 
show in recent memory, if there ever was one. There hasn't been a major Picasso 
or Calder show in recent memory. There have not been shows by many of these 
artists in Los Angeles, and that's what's so exciting about this. We intend to 
originate exhibitions in Los Angeles and not simply bring New York material 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Gagosian, for his part, says: "I'm glad (PaceWildenstein) is going to be 
there because it creates a better situation. Competition makes the world go 
'round. It will create more interest in art, more people will be talking about 
galleries and shows, and that's to everybody's benefit." 
</P>
<P>
 Some skeptics note that other New York galleries have tried and failed to 
establish Western outposts -- including Pace itself (before joining up with 
Wildenstein). Pace owner Arne Glimcher showed California artists at Ferus Pace, 
a La Cienega gallery he operated with BlumHelman owner Irving Blum in the late 
'60s. But the gallery lasted only briefly. 
</P>
<P>
 BlumHelman, which is based in New York, also pulled out of the L.A. market in 
1991 after five years trying to crack it. Blum couldn't be reached for comment, 
but several observers said the L.A. branch failed because BlumHelman kept its 
best work in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a responsible businessman who does well for his artists, but New Yorkers 
looked upon Los Angeles as an outlet, and Los Angeles doesn't like that," says 
Allan Schwartzman, a New York art critic and author of "Andy's Curse," about 
the rise and fall of the contemporary art market, which will be published next 
fall by Farrar, Straus & Giroux. "Los Angeles has significant collectors on par 
with New York collectors, and they don't like being treated that way. They 
expect to be treated with utmost respect." 
</P>
<P>
 Says TV producer Douglas S. Cramer, a major art collector and MOCA trustee: "I 
think as a contemporary collector, when you're buying things hot off the easel, 
there's always a general feeling, which was much stronger in the earlier '80s, 
there was too often a tendency that the West Coast shows were afterthoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Too often, (art for sale in L.A. was) work that didn't sell in New York, or 
artists or dealers had a tendency to send out things that were less than the 
very best. I believe the challenge is basically for dealers to show that what 
they have available here is the equal of or surpasses what there is in New 
York." 
</P>
<P>
 But the operative glass-half-full view of recent gallery failures is that it 
creates more opportunity for other important galleries. And Glimcher and 
Gagosian are considered likely to meet the challenge by many who credit both 
men with the business savvy -- and personal stake -- to see to it that their 
L.A. ventures succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Cramer says, "Arnold Glimcher and Larry Gagosian have a great many 
friends on the West Coast and spend time here. Glimcher has a second career in 
the movie business. Larry has a second career dating movie starlets. They'll 
want to present their best." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the origins of this L.A. story, you have to look to New York. It begins 
with the fallout that occurred when the New York art market collapsed in 1990. 
Sales and prices dropped at all levels of the market, but something else was 
happening too -- power and position were consolidating at the top. Some artists 
who were feeling the cut in sales and stipends ran to the top galleries, where 
they could rest on more solid footing. And as the top galleries reap the 
benefit of their clout, the art market has begun to take on the colors of the 
publishing world, where larger bookstore chains are chewing up bigger chunks of 
that market and elbowing out independents in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "The top of the market is working hard to consolidate its position and power, 
and the top galleries have done a good job of that," Schwartzman says. "Working 
in its favor are several factors -- one is there are more artists of proven 
historical value at the top of the market. A certain number are 
recession-proof, and many that aren't have a protected position, and they still 
will have a market, however reduced." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly the prime gallery boasting artists and estates with historical 
cachet is PaceWildenstein, whose roster of 31 includes such museum-quality 
superstars as Alexander Calder, Claes Oldenburg, Ad Reinhardt, Dan Flavin, 
Robert Irwin, Joseph Cornell and Robert Mangold. The gallery is planning to 
open in L.A. in September and has tentatively scheduled a show of new and 
existing work by Chuck Close. 
</P>
<P>
 Gagosian wouldn't comment on his half-dozen, but they include David Salle and 
Francesco Clemente, among the cream of New York's '80s art crop. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of PaceWildenstein, the forces of consolidation were particularly 
dramatic -- a new art entity that resulted from the merger a year ago in 
October of two of New York's finest galleries: Pace, known for its contemporary 
and modern lineup, and the 120-year-old Wildenstein & Co., among the world's 
largest private inventories of 19th-Century Impressionists and old masters. 
</P>
<P>
 For Wildenstein, the merger means potentially highly profitable access to a 
new list of wealthy clients.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's more interesting for Wildenstein than it is for Pace," says 
Peter Goulds, who owns the L.A. Louver Gallery. "If Wildenstein finds 2% new 
clients through its association with Pace Gallery, with their inventory that 
can be significant profit. You don't have to sell too many Rubens paintings to 
make a profit." 
</P>
<P>
 For Pace, the merger boosted the financial resources and reach of a gallery 
that had already metamorphosed into something of an aesthetic beehive (Pace 
Gallery, Pace Primitive, Pace Prints, Pace Master Prints and Pace McGill, which 
handles photography). And the aggressive post-merger strategy has been to court 
promising new markets around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have always been a handful of very powerful galleries in every major 
city -- Paris, London, Milan, New York -- but what's different is the 
globalization of the art market," says Bonnie Barrett Stretch, editor of 
ARTnewsletter. "The fact that Pace is seeking to have not just offices but 
galleries -- exhibition spaces -- in key cities around the world, that hasn't 
been done before or it hasn't been done successfully. They usually don't get 
past three (branches)." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Between PaceWildenstein and Wildenstein, which retains sole ownership of some 
spaces and the Wildenstein Institute in Paris, there will be galleries with 
their imprint in twice as many cities around the world by the end of next year. 
In Hong Kong, Pace-Wildenstein is collaborating with the Ho Gallery, expanding 
Ho's downtown space to 5,000 square feet and heralding the union with a grand 
opening this month of works by Picasso, Rothko, Oldenburg, Julian Schnabel and 
others. The linkup followed a Ho Gallery sale of Pace artist Jim Dine's prints 
that grossed $70,000, according to ARTnewsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 In India, PaceWildenstein hired a regional director for Southeast Asia last 
summer. In London, Wildenstein's 75-year-old space will be converted to 
accommodate Pace collections. 
</P>
<P>
 And Los Angeles is key to PaceWildenstein's expanded future. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the United States, it's the other place besides New York with the largest 
appetite for really being involved in art," says Marc Glimcher, director of 
PaceWildenstein and Arne Glimcher's son. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles has more PaceWildenstein clients than any other city outside New 
York, he says. That's due in no small measure to Arne Glimcher's extensive 
contacts in Hollywood, where he parlayed a stint 10 years ago as art tutor to 
director Ivan Reitman into a second career in film. Glimcher directed "The 
Mambo Kings" and produced "Gorillas in the Mist" and "The Good Mother," 
continuing to cultivate client relationships and friendships with such 
Hollywood heavyweights as Creative Artists Agency head Michael Ovitz, who's 
also his agent, producer David Wolper and Warner Bros. President Terry Semel. 
</P>
<P>
 The food chain of the Hollywood art world even shifted into reverse, with 
Glimcher mounting a gallery show of drawings by such directors as David Lynch, 
Martin Scorsese, Sergei Eisenstein and Federico Fellini. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hollywood is one of the few communities that continues to produce a new pool 
of beginning or potential collectors because it's one of the few industries 
that produces super-rich overnight," Schwartzman says. "Art is often used as a 
social calling card, and the more powerful that somebody like Arne Glimcher 
gets in the Hollywood community, the more attractive it is to collect art. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hear stories of Robin Williams getting a Picasso as a bonus. The idea of 
art being used as valued and respected currency seems to be very new, and I 
wouldn't be surprised if that has to do with Arne's crossover between the art 
and film business." 
</P>

 Gagosian, who is in his late 40s (he never gives his exact age) and is known 
as "Gogo," also has strong personal ties to Los Angeles, where he was born and 
raised. He graduated from UCLA in 1969, worked for the William Morris Agency 
and moved into the art business in the mid-'70s by selling posters on the 
sidewalk near UCLA. By 1980, Gagosian had opened a gallery, where he showed Sol 
Lewitt, Jean Michel Basquiat, Eric Fischl and Salle. Such important collectors 
as Douglas Cramer and real-estate developer Eli Broad began buying art from 
Gagosian. But by the early '80s, he was having trouble paying his debts, partly 
because his assets were frozen when the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. seized 
one lending bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Gagosian sorted out his money problems, and in 1985 he opened a space in New 
York's Chelsea district in a building owned by artist Sandro Chia. His ascent 
was aggressive, and his New York operation now straddles Art World Central, 
with galleries in SoHo and on Madison Avenue. He shows works from estates and 
by living artists and is also known for museum-quality historical exhibitions 
that are not for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 Some say Gagosian is opening in L.A. to compete with PaceWildenstein, a charge 
he denies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact of the matter is I leased my building before I knew where they were 
going to be," he says. "I had heard rumors, but I don't want to react, because 
if you do, you make mistakes. I'm from Los Angeles, and for a lot of reasons, 
it was something I thought made perfect sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, many believe that Gagosian, who left L.A. trailing a cloud of gossip 
about his finances, is plotting his return to town as the art world's prodigal 
son. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some say it's simply to compete with Pace, but it's erroneous competition 
because Pace is too far established for that competition to really be a 
sensible one," says longtime L.A. art dealer Goulds. "I can only think he wants 
to pick up the challenge of where he came from, to make good on unrequited 
promises. I can only imagine that's the reason because other than that, I think 
he has had enough experience to know it's not a place you can treat in a casual 
fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 Gagosian's plans for L.A. don't appear to be casual. Meier's design for the 
456 N. Camden Drive space formerly occupied by Salander-O'Reilly and Fred 
Hoffman Fine Arts calls for a new facade and a skylight shaped like a pyramid. 
Gagosian says the timing for the branch's spring opening was initially 
determined by market forces and the availability of the 5,000-square-foot 
space. He leased the space after Hoffman's rent concessions were about to 
expire, and the dealers are still talking about Hoffman's possible involvement 
in the new gallery, Hoffman says. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my career as an art dealer, a lot of my moves and decisions have actually 
been motivated by the opportunity to create what I think is a great space for 
art, an exciting space with unique architectural possibilities," Gagosian says. 
"This space to my mind offered all of that because it's very, very large in 
terms of volume, if not square footage. It's 22 feet high and 50 by 100 feet. 
We can do major sculpture installations." 
</P>
<P>
 Gagosian wouldn't discuss his stable or comment on any overlap with local 
galleries that have been handling work by his artists. PaceWildenstein said its 
overlap was minimal, and where it existed, the artist would choose 
representation. Kiki Smith, for example, will continue with the Shoshana Wayne 
Gallery in Santa Monica. The gallery's conflicts with local dealers could 
mount, however, if it pursues a plan to show more locally based artists, who 
would presumably be already established. 
</P>
<P>
 Leavin, who has handled such PaceWildenstein artists as Donald Judd, John 
Chamberlain and Oldenburg, says she expects to be shut out of having 
exhibitions of their work. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are not new artists to California," says Wendy Brandow, Margo Leavin 
Gallery director. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the face of all that East Coast clout, some question whether taking the 
New York art mountain to Mohammed will make any difference to the shopping 
habits of major L.A. collectors who shop back east anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "My habits are dictated by the picture," says Gagosian client David Geffen. 
"If the picture is in Timbuktu, I'd go to Timbuktu to see it. I'm in New York, 
so it doesn't make any difference to me. I think it makes a difference to 
people who travel far less than I do. A lot of people buy art on the spur of 
the moment." 
</P>
<P>
 Conversely, the New York contingent wants Los Angeles to evolve into Art 
Headquarters West for important collectors from Southern California to the 
Pacific Rim, just as New York attracts collectors from beyond Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a large number of people being transferred from Asian countries 
here," says Sotheby's Van de Kamp. "There has been in many of these Asian 
cultures a long tradition of collecting which has continued with people who 
have come from these countries and who live in Los Angeles. The interest in 
collecting and scholarship, I believe, must be prevalent in Los Angeles as well 
as the countries of the Pacific Rim." 
</P>
<P>
 W hat's more, all three New York operations say they'll be courting not just 
the Hollywood high-rollers but the mid-level and beginning collector, the 
younger strata of agents and managers as well as professionals outside the 
entertainment industry.  
</P>
<P>
 That holds particularly true for Sotheby's, which plans to hold two print and 
two jewelry sales a year. Some observers say Sotheby's is focusing on prints 
and jewelry because of the California Resale Royalty Act, which sets aside 5% 
of art sales in secondary markets for the artist; prints are exempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Van de Kamp denied that Sotheby's wanted to avoid sharing the profits. Rather, 
she said, the auction house wanted to tap the keen local interest in prints and 
jewelry and develop the ranks of beginning collectors. (Painting auctions are 
centered in New York and London because they fetch higher prices there.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Prints are a great way to attract new audiences," she says. "You don't need 
$100,000 to come to a Sotheby's auction. You can spend $500, and everyone has a 
wall in their house." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, New Yorkers are mindful of the fact that the art world above all 
is a world of relationships, and a collector is born when he or she is wooed in 
the flesh, not by fax. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Marc Glimcher: "When they're real collectors, they're in here a hundred 
times not buying anything. They're here one time in a hundred buying something. 
That's the real soul of collecting. You can't deal with transparencies over the 
telephone. And you can't do it in 15 minutes between meetings with writers in 
New York. This isn't caviar. This is real passion. That means real involvement, 
so hence the gallery."

NEW DEVELOPMENT TO SPROUT ON LOT OF TRASH AND WEEDS; DESIGN FOR 
COMMERCIAL-HOUSING PROJECT ON FORMER SITE OF PEPPERDINE UNIVERSITY WILL BE 
PICKED BY DEC. 13 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Once the site of a bustling university campus, the dusty, weedy lot at the 
corner of 81st Street and Vermont Avenue is strewn with trash and debris. 
</P>
<P>
 The property, which is barren and has been in disrepair for two decades, 
clashes with the well-kept homes of the nearby Vermont Knolls neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 But by the middle of next year, construction will begin on a housing and 
commercial development project on the land, the site of Pepperdine University 
before it moved to Malibu in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 First Interstate Bank impaneled seven people to judge dozens of development 
proposals, for which the bank would provide $15 million in construction loans. 
The winning developer is to assume ownership of the land from Mehdi Bollour, 
and be responsible for completing the project and maintaining it, bank 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges have whittled down the entries to three finalists and will decide 
on a winner by Dec. 13. The winning project promises to be one of the largest 
developments in the South Vermont Avenue corridor in 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the most recent history of many of these neighborhoods is that 
they've been neglected in terms of quality development," said Michaele 
Pride-Wells, owner of the Marina del Rey firm re:Architecture and one of the 
judges. 
</P>
<P>
 "This competition provides some support for high-quality, community-based 
design," said Pride-Wells, who is familiar with the area through volunteering 
with the Coalition of Neighborhood Planners, a development planning group in 
South Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges include Los Angeles City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, residents 
and outside urban planners and architects. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking for something that will not only meet the criteria of what the 
land is to be used for; I'm also looking at the aesthetics (of the development) 
that are suited for the area," said John Outerbridge, one of the judges and a 
renowned local artist who is a former director of the Watts Towers Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
 From a pool of 10 developers and 66 architects statewide, the judges selected 
three teams of community redevelopment corporations, architects, contractors 
and property managers in June to compete as finalists in the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The winning proposal will be sensitive to community concerns, such as added 
population density from more housing, financial feasibility and an enhancement 
to the existing neighborhood. The winning team must also ensure that the 
project's development will create employment opportunities for residents, 
although the number of jobs has not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by First Interstate in conjunction with Ridley-Thomas, each team 
received $25,000 from the bank to gather input from community members on 
features they would like to see in the development. 
</P>
<P>
 The resulting proposals: 
</P>
<P>
 * A development with 35 single-family homes and 14,000 square feet of 
commercial space designed by Caleb Development. The project would include 
offices for USC's Business Expansion Network, which would help fledgling 
community-based businesses in on-site spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 * A multilevel project designed by the Vermont-Slauson-Sherman group that 
would include retail and community space at the street level and upper-level 
studio or loft spaces that could be converted either to office space or 
townhomes. 
</P>
<P>
 * An "urban village" designed by the Barker-Catalyst-LR/MPR team that would be 
made up of retail spaces at the street level, including 17 senior citizen 
housing units, and 47 units for families on the upper levels. There would also 
be community services such as child development and senior citizens' programs, 
a family health facility and neighborhood employment center. 
</P>
<P>
 The public still has a chance to view the scale models of the three competing 
proposals. The models will be on display at the First Interstate headquarters 
Downtown, 707 Wilshire Blvd., through Thursday.

BANKING ON THE COMMUNITY; CREDIT UNION MANAGER STUDIES INTERETHNIC RELATIONS TO 
ATTRACT INVESTMENTS FROM EVERYONE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A yearning to be politically correct might have driven some to take a course 
in multicultural awareness, but Tammy Brown's motivation was dollars and sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, 30, is the manager of the fledgling South-Central People's Federal 
Credit Union on Crenshaw Boulevard. The credit union is striving to provide 
some economic arms and legs for a community that has been crippled by a lack of 
financial institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to succeed, Brown must convince those who live, work or worship in 
the area bounded by the Santa Monica Freeway on the north, Imperial Highway on 
the south, Alameda Street on the east and La Brea Avenue on the west to bank 
with the credit union so it will have the funds to invest in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a target area that is 50% Latino and growing, less than 2% of Brown's 
members were Latino last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want this to be an African American credit union, we want this to be 
community credit union," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 So nine months ago Brown, who is African American, enrolled in the Leadership 
Development in Interethnic Relations program so that she could learn to 
surmount cultural barriers and attract more Latinos. She graduated earlier this 
month and is putting what she learned to work. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was begun by the Asian Pacific American Legal Center in 1991. But 
after the 1992 riots made the need for greater interethnic understanding 
obvious, an old-school, civil rights organization, the Martin Luther King 
Dispute Resolution Center/Southern Christian Leadership Conference, and a legal 
advocacy group, the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund, signed 
on to help organize the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Each year organizers select about 20 people from nearly 100 Los Angeles 
applicants. Those chosen are different colors, different ages and have 
different jobs and educational backgrounds, but all must have demonstrated some 
commitment to bettering their communities, said Laura Mendoza, one of the 
program coordinators. 
</P>
<P>
 The program provides a safe forum where participants can openly discuss 
potentially explosive topics such as ethnic tensions in their neighborhoods, 
racial stereotypes and identity. 
</P>
<P>
 And personal revelations during these sessions offered the opportunity for the 
entire group to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 During one workshop, Father Richard Estrada, 50, was asked to which group did 
he belong, Latino, Hispanic or Mexican American? 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada paused, then realized he could not choose. Hispanic -- too generic, 
Mexican American -- too conservative, Latino -- just not right, none of the 
labels fit. While he stood before the group struggling to understand himself, 
he explained to the class why he is Chicano. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm American but with the baggage of the culture and memory of my Mexican 
family. I can have filet mignon with refried beans and tortillas. I can speak 
both English and Spanish and that's a gift. I'm Chicano. It's a political 
statement," Estrada said. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada said he hoped he was able to help his fellow classmates better 
understand his people. The program's organizers emphasized that honest 
communication can defuse potentially volatile interethnic relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a program that gives people tools to address the challenge of racial 
tension in their own communities," said Kathleen Hiyake, project director. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine months of training is divided into three phases. The first phase 
focuses on cultural sensitivity. Brown's class went on a weekend retreat to 
examine what were real ethnic differences and what were just misperceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 The second phase helps build organizational leadership and conflict resolution 
skills. Members are trained in public speaking and ways that disenfranchised 
communities can influence the media to portray their communities truthfully. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first two phases the participants meet for training two Saturdays 
each month. The third phase, however, is more demanding. The participants 
divide into teams and implement projects in communities facing interethnic 
strife. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's class, which graduated earlier this month, initiated four projects. 
</P>
<P>
 One team provided a curriculum of cultural awareness, communication and 
conflict resolution training to Explorer Scouts helping Wilshire division 
officers with non-hazardous duties.  
</P>
<P>
 Because some of the Scouts eventually become police officers, it was important 
to program member and former Police Officer Julio Perez that they be sensitive 
to the concerns of communities of color. 
</P>
<P>
 Two teams focused on challenges facing South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 One worked with local youth and the Crossroads National Education and Arts 
Center in Leimert Park to organize a national video teleconference that gave 
youths from around the country a chance to speak out on race relations. 
</P>
<P>
 The other South-Central group worked with Eureka Communities, an umbrella 
group of 25 youth service agencies, to devise a comprehensive model to educate 
teen-agers in interethnic conflict resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Gabriel Valley Team provided five days of diversity training to 30 
Pasadena High School students. These students will serve as mentors for younger 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 But program organizers are most concerned with how graduates implement their 
training in their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 When you telephone Brown's credit union the message you hear says "Thanks for 
calling" and "Gracias por llamar." And although the tray holding the Spanish 
brochures for low-interest home loans is still full, Brown has made some 
progress in attracting Latino clients. 
</P>
<P>
 She has added two Latino client assistants to her staff and her percentage of 
Latino credit union members has increased to 5%. They aren't flooding her 
office yet, but Brown said she has put out the welcome mat.

FIRE UNIT HELPS GANG MEMBERS RESTART LIVES; FOREST SERVICE: FIGHTING WILDERNESS 
BLAZES KEEPS YOUNG ADULTS OFF THE STREETS. BUT THE WORK IS ONLY SEASONAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To Danny Cortez, the East Los Angeles Aztecs firefighting crew has been a 
lifesaver in more ways than one. 
</P>
<P>
 The crew, a new on-call unit working for the U.S. Forest Service, spent up to 
three weeks away from home at a time fighting fires during the past several 
months. Being away meant helping save forests, homes and the lives of 
strangers, but it also kept crew members off the violent streets most of them 
know too well. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up in the neighborhood. I had problems with gangs all my life," said 
Cortez, 21, who was charged with murder twice but was not convicted. "If every 
neighborhood had a (firefighting) crew, there'd be no violence in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs, whose members were trained last spring in time for the region's 
busiest fire season, is the second Forest Service firefighting crew in Los 
Angeles County made up primarily of former gang members or residents trying to 
break away from street life. The South-Central Panthers, also an on-call unit, 
were trained in mid-1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs have about 25 active members 18 or older, down from more than 40 
potential members recruited for the initial training. The crew members are paid 
about $9 an hour, with some earning more if they take on leadership roles. 
</P>
<P>
 The work involves leaving East Los Angeles at a moment's notice to help fight 
fires throughout California or places such as Colorado, Oregon and Washington 
state. The grueling hours include long hikes with heavy backpacks, helicopter 
rides, chopping down trees and operating firefighting equipment. The trade-off 
is a paying job that generates self-esteem and takes members to places as 
different from East Los Angeles as most of them could imagine. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could really think out there," Cortez said. "There's a lot of our crew 
that had never even been out of L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Cortez and others said the major drawback has been that the work is seasonal 
so it does not answer their needs year-round. Several work part-time or odd 
jobs; others inevitably fill some of the down time with illegal activities such 
as dealing drugs, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfred Mendoza, 31, who works part time as a forklift operator at a produce 
warehouse, is among those who hope to capture a full-time job with the Forest 
Service.  
</P>
<P>
 "This job keeps us busy," Mendoza said. "You ain't got to look over your back. 
You're just working, working, working. A lot of people compliment you. It gives 
you self-esteem." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Barreras, 35, said the past two years have been tough because he was 
laid off from Northrop Corp. after working there 10 years. A full-time job 
would help him provide for his wife and four children, even though it would be 
difficult to be away from them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes a lot of dedication," he said. "This was my first time away from 
them. Everybody is really sad because you're gone. But when you get back, it's 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Forest Service officials said the Aztecs received outstanding performance 
ratings at every job site this year. The crew was hard-working and performed as 
well as any of the other 40-odd on-call fire suppression units in the state, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we would have been surprised if there were a lot of problems," said 
Gregory S. Greenhoe, deputy fire management officer for the Forest Service at 
Angeles National Forest. "If we had an earthquake or a fire tomorrow, we'd call 
the Aztecs." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenhoe and Fire Capt. Mark Glos said the Forest Service hopes to train 
enough local residents to create at least two crews of Aztecs. Other goals 
include helping the crews develop their own internal leadership and perhaps 
hiring a few members full time, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 A community group called Padrinos helped recruit the existing crew members and 
will continue to co-sponsor the program, said Mike Jaramillo, a member of the 
group. Many crew members are dropouts who must earn at least a high school 
equivalency diploma to be eligible for full-time work with the Forest Service, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My idea is to get them into a program like this and get them into 
decision-making positions," said Jaramillo, 58, a former gang member who admits 
having had his own run-ins with law enforcement authorities. "They relate to 
me. It's a good relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Jaramillo, employment director at the Chicana Service Action Center in 
Downtown Los Angeles, said a couple of immediate goals include trying to keep 
crew members working and perhaps involving at least a few women in the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't give up. This might be the answer," he said.

ART; A LATE BLOOMER; CHARLES GARABEDIAN CAME LATE TO ART, BUT HIS 'LABORS OF 
HERCULES' AT L.A. LOUVER REVEALS WORK SENSITIVE TO ANCIENT GRECIAN THEMES AND

 'I've never played the art game, because I started my career 10 years late -- 
and I don't see that as an advantage,"says artist Charles Garabedian. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'd started at the right age I probably would have been an Abstract 
Expressionist painter -- I would have loved that, too, because for me Jackson 
Pollock is the most important artist of the 20th Century," adds Garabedian, who 
didn't pick up a paintbrush until he was 31 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming late to the game, what the 72-year-old artist did instead was hammer 
out a style of figurative abstraction revolving around symbols and themes drawn 
from Greek mythology. Combining elements of Surrealism, folk and Outsider art 
and the graphic whimsy of Saul Steinberg, Garabedian's flat, iconic paintings 
are freighted with Jungian portent and feel very much of the Old World. 
</P>
<P>
 There's also something Byzantine about his lurid visual fables, and as is true 
of work by Francesco Clemente, who works similar turf, they have a 
Mediterranean fragrance. Sex and violence crop up repeatedly in Garabedian's 
art but are rendered with the good-natured bounce characteristic of cartoons; 
this flippant take on tragedy is what makes his work modern. 
</P>
<P>
 Garabedian -- the subject of a survey exhibition at the La Jolla Museum of 
Contemporary Art in 1981 and a mid-career retrospective at the Rose Art Museum 
at Brandeis University in Massachusetts in 1983 -- has been making these 
provocative paintings and exhibiting them hereabouts for more than 30 years, 
yet he remains one of the art world's better-kept secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 His show of new works, "The Labors of Hercules," on view at L.A. Louver 
Gallery through Dec. 23, will no doubt be visited by many of his local 
colleagues -- Garabedian has long been an artist's artist -- but it may be 
overlooked by those who prefer art with the heavy perfume of trend. That's 
never been what Garabedian is about. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chas is a great artist, and the only reason he hasn't had a bigger career is 
because he's too eccentric and is too much of an outsider," says artist Ed 
Moses, who has known Garabedian for 40 years. "Chas is a lone wolf who carves 
his work out of history rather than contemporary movements." 
</P>
<P>
 Of "The Labors of Hercules," which finds him moving away from figuration in 
the direction of pure abstraction, Garabedian says, "these paintings are a 
response to my last show at L.A. Louver in 1992, which was a series of studies 
based on 'The Iliad.' These new paintings were inspired by an analysis of Greek 
myth written by Robert Graves -- I was taken with the myth of the labors of 
Hercules because it's such a great metaphor for life itself, and for what we 
all face." 
</P>
<P>
 Garabedian's labors take place in the studio he has occupied for 15 years on a 
flea-bitten block of West Washington Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I come here every day and listen to opera while I paint -- I think I'll play 
Bizet today," he says one recent morning. "I lived in New York in 1986 and 
1987, but mostly my life has been spent in L.A. -- my work is very much a 
product of this city in its use of light and color. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's something of Armenia in there too, however," says Garabedian, whose 
father emigrated to the United States from the family's homeland in 1920. 
"Until 10 years ago, I saw no connection between my work and Armenia. The 
Armenians who emigrated to America were working people, and my father was a 
farmer prior to leaving Armenia -- he wasn't a cultured man. The Armenians who 
migrated into Syria, Egypt and Lebanon in the '20s, however, went to school and 
became more cultured. After World War II they were driven out of Egypt by Syria 
and Iran, and many of them came to America. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because they were educated, many of them looked up Armenian artists in 
America, so I got to know some of them, and when they saw my work they said, 
'There's a collective unconscious at work here.' They showed me some Armenian 
manuscript painting, and there was a remarkable similarity in line, color and 
attitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of that visual information was in the world I grew up in, and I don't 
know why I was attracted to the arts. I think it's just being either blessed or 
cursed with a kind of middle-range intelligence, combined with the social 
situations I was in, coalesced to create this kind of life." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the life Garabedian has led was difficult in certain regards, you 
would never guess that to talk to him. An easygoing, upbeat character with a 
wry sense of humor, he tells the story of his life with little emotion and a 
lot of self-deprecating wit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was born in Detroit in 1923, the youngest in a family of three children," 
he begins. "When I was 2 my mother died, so I was sent with my older sisters to 
live in an orphanage. My father worked in an automobile plant in Detroit, but 
around the time my mother died he was in a car accident that left him crippled, 
so he couldn't take care of three small children. He never recovered enough to 
work again and spent the rest of his life being cared for by my sisters -- his 
life was quite tragic. He lost his wife, his health, his country, and never 
liked it in America. He would have loved to return to Armenia but was forced to 
leave by the Turks." 
</P>
<P>
 When Garabedian was 9, the family reunited and moved to San Gabriel, where his 
father bought a chicken ranch, which quickly failed. Living on welfare, at the 
height of the Depression, the family moved to East L.A., where Garabedian 
graduated from Garfield High School. In 1942 he enlisted in the Army and was 
sent to Northern Africa, where he stayed until 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a gunner on a plane, which means it was my job to point a gun out the 
window and shoot at other planes," he says. "I was 19 years old, and death 
isn't a reality at that age, so I was too stupid to be afraid. I saw people 
die, but I doubt that I killed anyone -- it might have been some kind of 
awakening, had I known for sure that I killed somebody. Mostly I was just a fun 
guy and wasn't unhappy in the Army, because we lived a wild life over there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Returning to L.A. from the Army in 1945, Garabedian went to college on the GI 
Bill, first studying literature and philosophy at UC Santa Barbara from 1947 to 
1948. He then transferred to USC, where he switched his major to history, and 
received his bachelor's degree in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd begun to lose interest in literature and philosophy towards the end of my 
time at USC, so after I graduated I began working crummy jobs -- I worked at 
the Chrysler plant in Maywood for a while and at the railroad. I had no 
ambition when I was in my 20s and spent all my time on the golf course and at 
the track. I was gambling, but that wasn't how I made my living -- that was how 
I lost it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still go to the track once a week -- the thing that continues to pull me 
there is the environment of the track, the people and the trashiness of it. I 
think it feeds my work.When I'm there I think about Hieronymus Bosch, who 
painted his figures very sympathetically. It's as if they're helpless and can't 
control themselves -- you gotta have sympathy for them. My figures are painted 
to suggest something awkward and ungainly because that's how I see humanity." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1954, Garabedian moved to an apartment on Crenshaw Boulevard in the 
Wilshire district that he shared with two roommates. One day a friend of one of 
his roommates stopped by and Garabedian had a fortuitous encounter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy was Ed Moses, who'd just graduated from UCLA," he recalls. "He was 
taking drawing lessons from Howard Warshaw then, and one night he stopped by on 
his way to class and invited me along. I went, Howard gave me paper and a pen, 
pointed to a cow skull and told me to draw it. At the end of class he looked at 
what I'd done and said, 'Not bad -- why don't you come back?' So I drew with 
Howard for about a month, and Ed and I became friends -- in fact, we had 
apartments across the hall from each other on the beach in Santa Monica in 
1957." 
</P>
<P>
 Recalls Moses: "Before I met Chas I heard about him from this mutual friend of 
ours, who told me about this pal of his who was sort of out of it. He said this 
guy had graduated from USC but was fed up with life and had thrown in the 
sponge, so he was working nights for the railroad and hanging out at the track 
all day. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy said Chas had talent, though, and that he'd been making these 
paintings I should see. I saw them and said I thought the guy really had 
something -- they were very naive paintings, but there was something there. It 
was sort of like mad art -- they had a definite edge, and that edge has never 
left his work. There's always a lot of tension and Angst in Chas' paintings." 
</P>
<P>
 At Moses and Howard Warshaw's encouragement, Garabedian enrolled in graduate 
school at UCLA in 1957, where he studied with painter William Brice for four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being in art school was like being in the Army. I had a great time -- in 
fact, I've always had a good time," Garabedian says with a laugh. "I just have 
a sunny disposition. As (artist) Lance Richbourg said, 'Immortality's only 
interesting if you're alive,' and I don't worry about anything other than 
what's in the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't mind if all my paintings went up in smoke either, because it's the 
activity rather than what it produces that interests me. I make art to find out 
who I am -- and so far I've been rather disappointed in what I've discovered. 
I'd hoped to find Giotto or Omar Khayyam in there somewhere. I can key it to 
three words: I want my work to be primal, archetypal and monumental. Those 
qualities are at odds with my nature, which is lighthearted, yet you can't help 
pining for things." 
</P>
<P>
 Garabedian graduated from UCLA with a master of fine arts degree in 1961, and 
the following year he met Gwendolyn Morris, whom he married in 1963. They have 
two daughters, Claire Garabedian, a cellist living in Boston, and Sophia 
Garabedian, an artist who lives in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I was leaving the house this morning my wife said, 'Don't tell that 
reporter I supported you,' but she more or less did, because I didn't start 
selling work until 1978," he says. "I taught at various schools from 1961 to 
'73, but I hated teaching. I'd always go home from a day of it feeling like I'd 
spent the day lying." 
</P>
<P>
 If Garabedian's ambitions weren't aroused by academia, they weren't fired up 
by the idea of cracking the gallery system either. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't want to be at Ferus" -- L.A.'s hippest gallery during the period 
when Garabedian began his career -- "because all my friends showed at the Ceeje 
Gallery and we were happy with our scene," he says. "The Ceeje Gallery was 
started by two interior decorators, Cecil Hedrick and Jerry Jerome, who were 
always broke. In order to make ends meet they emptied their space in the spring 
of 1962 and rented it to Joan Ankrum, who was having an exhibition of Morris 
Broderson. He was popular at the time and Joan wanted extra space to show more 
of his work, so they rented their space to Joan and she sold the show out. At 
that point Jay and Cecil decided to get into the art business." 
</P>
<P>
 Recalls Moses: "I introduced Chas to my friends at Ferus, but they weren't 
interested in his work at all. That group tended to be very focused and limited 
in their views -- Bob Irwin, in particular, could never understand my interest 
in Chas' work. So Chas started showing at the Ceeje Gallery, which opened a few 
years after Ferus, and developed a coterie of friends there, and he was the 
unofficial leader because he was the most intelligent and educated. Chas has a 
very sophisticated mind, and he spends a lot of time ruminating and reading -- 
he's very much a man of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Garabedian: "I started exhibiting at Ceeje in 1962, but it wasn't until 
1965 that I began to find my own voice as an artist. At that point I realized 
the work I'd been making was completely the product of my schooling and that I 
had to throw out the rules I'd so dutifully learned if I wanted to get 
anywhere. At that point my notions about what art was changed dramatically." 
</P>
<P>
 Freed of the restrictions imposed on his imagination by UCLA, Garabedian 
embarked on a period of wild experimentation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made sculpture out of things like chicken wire, wallboard and resin, and 
worked with Flo-Paque, a crafts paint used for painting on dishes," he says. "I 
made a series of sculptures out of butcher paper and glue, which I exhibited at 
the Ceeje Gallery in 1966, and after the show I folded them up and put them in 
the trash." 
</P>
<P>
 Having sown his wild oats in terms of testing alternative materials, 
Garabedian returned to paint and canvas and zeroed in on a set of parameters 
he's more or less stuck with for the past 16 years; central to those parameters 
are the nude human figure and sexuality. 
</P>
<P>
 "The figures I paint are always nude because I don't want them to be tied to a 
time or station in life," he explains. "And, to paint clothing properly you 
have to paint from life, which is something I also avoid -- I'm interested in 
creating archetypal figures and I don't think you can do that when you paint 
from life. I don't work from photographs either -- the paintings come entirely 
from my head -- and my work always tells a story, although that's not by 
choice. I favor the long horizontal band format because I don't like creating 
illusions of depth. That somehow seems false to me, and a painting that unfurls 
horizontally somehow seems less apt to create illusions of depth. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a very consistent attitude about sex in the work. The women are 
always aggressive, and the men are passive -- I'm sure that's a reflection of 
the relationship between my wife and I. She wears the pants in the family and I 
don't argue much with her decisions. My friends tend to be men, yet I think men 
are worthless in a way that women aren't, and I think those feelings are 
reflected in the work. 
</P>
<P>
 "The paintings always surprise me," he adds. "I begin them, then they take 
over and lead me, and it's frightening, like a roller-coaster ride. You lose 
it, you get it back, then you lose it again. Sometimes I surrender to the 
painting, and sometimes I fight it. Regardless of who wins, art has given me an 
amazingly rich ride through life."

WHAT'S DANCE WITHOUT THE DETAILS?; THE SPLENDOR OF LATE DESIGNER JENS-JACOB 
WORSAAE'S SETS AND COSTUMES LIVES ON AS SAN FRANCISCO BALLET'S 'ROMEO AND 
JULIET' VENTURES SOUTH TO THE MUSIC CENTER 
</P>

<P>
 Nobody planned it that way, but the new $900,000 San Francisco Ballet "Romeo 
and Juliet" that opens Wednesday at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion can be 
considered a monument to the late Danish designer Jens-Jacob Worsaae. 
</P>
<P>
 Both celebrated and controversial for his daring reconceptualization of 
familiar works and his insistence on minutely detailed workmanship, Worsaae 
influenced ballet production throughout North America and Europe before his 
death from cancer in August -- five months after the San Francisco "Romeo and 
Juliet" premiere. He was 48. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the lusty/dusty verismo versions of the Shakespeare/Prokofiev 
ballet familiar to local audiences, Worsaae envisioned a painterly, 
aristocratic High Renaissance Verona partly inspired by the works of Venetian 
artist Vittore Carpaccio. From marbled floors to paneled ceilings, his sets 
leave plenty of space for dancing yet are meticulously finished for their own 
sake, with ornately carved and gilded columns, rich tapestries and frescoes, 
even a super-balcony: a bridge unit suspended 12 feet above the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Too ill to travel far from his native Copenhagen, Worsaae never saw a 
rehearsal or performance of this "Romeo and Juliet" except on videotape. 
However, throughout the production period, he helped supervise the workmanship 
of widely separated teams of specialized artisans. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabric for his costumes, for instance, was bought white and dyed in England -- 
sometimes four times -- then silk-screened. Bodice pieces went to Denmark for 
embroidery and back to England for beading (seed-pearls being a Worsaae 
trademark), with the designer periodically joining San Francisco Ballet 
artistic director (and "Romeo" choreographer) Helgi Tomasson in London to judge 
the results. The process often took three months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jens-Jacob would hardly ever compromise," Tomasson recalls. "He didn't like 
shortcuts. People in the costume shop would say, 'Jens-Jacob, nobody's going to 
see that (detail) from the back row.' And he would answer, 'The dancers are 
going to see it. And when they put on costumes like that, they feel very 
special and it carries through into their dancing.' He felt very strongly about 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Boston Ballet artistic director Bruce Marks remembers that Worsaae's demands 
"drove my staff a little crazy. He would have them move a line of gold braid on 
a costume maybe an eighth of an inch -- when the closest seat to any dancer in 
my theater is 60 feet away. But his reason was always 'It must be right.' And 
right to him meant right from four inches away or 400 feet away." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Local dance audiences first saw Worsaae's designs in 1979, when a touring 
group called Soloists of the Royal Danish Ballet visited Pasadena with a 
program honoring the centenary of the great Romantic choreographer August 
Bournonville. The iridescent pastels and gleaming accents of his costumes 
suggested period richness without any hint of the grandiose, just as his choice 
of fabrics achieved ideal lightness and flow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jens-Jacob was always concerned with how the dancers moved in his costumes," 
Marks emphasizes. "He always talked about the 19th Century in terms of 
lightness: 'We've got to get it light.' And, of course, the actual costumes of 
Bournonville's time were never light. They were heavy and cumbersome -- on big 
bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look at his work, it isn't a reproduction of 19th-Century 
costuming," Marks continues. "It's quite modern -- the fabric, the color range, 
the fact that the costumes were always dyed and painted rather than a single, 
solid color. They didn't look old-fashioned and yet they were classical: a 
reinterpretation of Romantic costumes in contemporary terms." 
</P>
<P>
 Marks had met Worsaae in Copenhagen in the early '70s and first worked with 
him on a piece called "Innerspace" for Nederlands Dans Theater before becoming 
artistic co-director of Ballet West in Salt Lake City midway through that 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 They later collaborated on a number of productions -- none more acclaimed than 
the 1985 recon struction of Bournonville's long-lost Arabian Nights ballet 
"Abdallah" for Ballet West. Soon after, that production entered the repertories 
of the Boston Ballet (when Marks became director) and the Royal Danish Ballet 
itself. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By the time "Abdallah" premiered, the new artistic director of the Royal 
Danish Ballet was Frank Andersen, co-founder of the touring Soloists group and 
a longtime friend of Worsaae's. "Jens-Jacob designed my wife's wedding gown in 
1983," he recalls, "and that summer the three of us went around Europe together 
in a car." 
</P>
<P>
 He lists the cities fondly, the way other Worsaae collaborators name 
productions: "Stuttgart, Venice, Nice, Cannes, St. Tropez, Paris. It was a 
wonderful summer. Jens-Jacob was a very dear, very honest person and it was 
always a great honor for me to hear him say I was one of his friends." 
</P>
<P>
 The late '80s proved extraordinarily productive for Worsaae, with even the 
Bolshoi Ballet (not exactly a haven for Western designers) adding to his 
laurels. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, Helgi Tomasson was passing through Copenhagen and a former teacher 
advised him to take a look at costumes and scenery that Worsaae created for the 
famed Tivoli Pantomime Theater. "I liked what I saw," Tomasson says, "and got 
ahold of (Worsaae's) telephone number through a friend and called him up the 
next morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Their meeting led to a series of San Francisco Ballet commissions beginning 
with Tomasson's "Intimate Voices" in 1987 and continuing into the future with a 
projected production of Flemming Flindt's "The Lesson" (the last designs 
Worsaae completed) in 1996. However, it was three distinctive versions of 
full-length classics that generated the greatest attention: "Swan Lake" (1988), 
"Sleeping Beauty" (1990) and the new "Romeo and Juliet." 
</P>
<P>
 Each of these projects, Tomasson reveals, proved to be largely designer-driven 
in concept. The Watteau-style "Swan Lake," for instance, evolved from Worsaae's 
desire to enhance the fluidity of Tomasson's new choreography: "He saw a 
rehearsal and asked me, 'Would you want the ballet to be (traditionally) 
Gothic?' I said, 'No, it doesn't have to be that.' And he said, 'Why not move 
it up a bit, make it 18th Century? I can use different materials (for that 
period) that have more of a flow." 
</P>
<P>
 For "Sleeping Beauty," Tomasson and Worsaae discussed how to dramatize the 
passage of 100 years that takes place midway through the action. While in 
Moscow for his Bolshoi commission, Worsaae thought of the contrast between the 
ancient, Asiatic Russia of boyars and icons versus the Frenchified 
Westernization imposed under Peter the Great. He called Tomasson to ask, "Why 
can't 'Sleeping Beauty' take place here ?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last December, the Royal Dan ish Ballet staged its own Tomasson/Worsaae 
"Sleeping Beauty," one modeled on their San Francisco version but even more 
scenically elaborate (three-dimensional onion-domes instead of a painted 
backdrop, for instance). 
</P>
<P>
 It was the most expensive production in the company's history, Frank Andersen 
says, and it took shape at a time when Worsaae was coming to the theater 
directly from exhausting chemotherapy sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was very, very sick," Andersen remembers. "We even felt sometimes that he 
was close to the end but his willpower denied accepting the fact and brought 
him through." 
</P>
<P>
 The production is scheduled to be videotaped next April for television and 
possible video distribution, and Andersen considers it "one of the most 
beautiful I have ever seen. I think he knew that it was most likely his last 
chance to show what a genius he was, and I think that (genius) came out loud 
and clear on opening night." Worsaae was subsequently knighted, the first 
designer so honored in Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
 To Tomasson, "Romeo and Juliet" represents Worsaae's "most personal production 
in many ways. When I asked him to do it (in 1991), he said, 'Helgi, I have 
wanted to do that ballet more than any other work, ever.' And I said, 'Well, it 
was one ballet I always wanted to dance but never did -- so maybe it will be a 
good time for us to get together.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "There is something in the production that I identify with him. Maybe it has 
to do with the colors, maybe just the way he talked about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, Worsaae drafted plans for his own funeral that included his body 
being carried out of the church to a lament from Prokofiev's score. As usual, 
his wishes were obeyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last time I spoke with him was the evening he died," Tomasson says. "From 
just his tone of voice, I knew that he had only a short time left. He suffered 
so much. It was incredible how much he suffered and how little he let on. He 
was a very private person and did not talk much about himself or his family. 
But he loved to talk about dance -- about costumes, scenery, productions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember him telling me that maybe some day people will look back on what 
we accomplished together and say, 'They really took the time to do it right. 
They didn't have to, but they did.' I will miss him very much."

 Four years ago, the free mental health services provided by the Community 
Counseling Service, a nonprofit facility that has served the inner city since 
1975, were on the verge of being wiped out by proposed cuts in county mental 
health expenditures. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the agency was spared the cuts that would have devastated its 
programs, the next few years were still tough. The recession dried up most of 
the private donations it had depended on, and the departure of a president 
skilled in fund raising took an additional toll. 
</P>
<P>
 But thanks to four years of belt-tightening and a few cuts in staff and 
services, the Community Counseling Service has survived, and is ready to move 
from the aging South-Central church it has occupied since its inception to a 
gleaming new 6,200-square-foot facility at 1145 Wilshire Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 The service will share the site with the agency's outpatient "Amanecer" 
clinic, a bilingual treatment center.  
</P>
<P>
 Originally an outreach program of the United University Church, the Community 
Counseling Service provides individual and family counseling, gang 
intervention, suicide prevention, medication, job skills education, referrals 
and shelter to residents of the Westlake and Pico-Union areas as well as 
South-Central. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the agency has opened two residential facilities, one a 
short-term home with psychiatric services for mentally ill homeless adults near 
the church, and another for troubled adolescent Latinas in Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 During the recent lean years, the agency struggled to keep both homes and the 
Amanecer facility afloat. A second outpatient facility that provided sliding 
scale fee-for-service treatment for middle-class patients without health 
insurance in the Wilshire area had to be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It drained all our resources just to survive," said Hugh Biele, who became 
president a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the diversification of some of its programs, the agency's 
thriftiness over the past few years has been complemented by funding from 
United Way and community development grants.  
</P>
<P>
 To remain out of the woods, the agency will continue seeking additional grant 
funds, and will try to work with other agencies to stretch services, executive 
director Craig Schweon said. 
</P>
<P>
 By combining under one roof its administrative and outpatient functions, the 
agency will save money in the long run, Schweon said. If funding allows, the 
future could include setting up another fee-for-service program for uninsured 
patients. LESLIE BERESTEIN

 El Rescate, a center catering to the legal, social-service and educational 
needs of Central American refugees, has launched a series of Monday night 
meetings to keep Latino immigrants informed about the progress of Proposition 
187 as the controversial voter-approved initiative moves through the courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The meetings will focus on the different legal challenges (Proposition 187) 
is facing," said Jaime Flores, acting executive director of the center."They 
will last as long as there is a response from the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Participants will receive weekly updates on legal decisions surrounding the 
initiative, which threatens to cut off social, educational and medical services 
to illegal immigrants. They will also be advised on what actions they should 
and should not take to protect themselves and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 Information will be presented on how those who do not have legal resident 
status can apply for residency -- including political asylum, for which many 
Central Americans are eligible, Flores said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Prop. 187 meetings, which begin at 7 p.m., are the first of their kind for 
El Rescate, but the center has long hosted other weekly informational meetings. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Every other Wednesday at 6 p.m., the center sponsors information sessions for 
people interested in becoming U.S. citizens. They are shown how to apply and 
then referred to adult schools offering citizenship classes. Sessions dealing 
exclusively with the legalization process are held Tuesdays at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The center is at 1340 S. Bonnie Brae St. Information: (213) 387-3284. LESLIE

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: KOREATOWN; RACIAL HARMONY IS STRESSED AT FORUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Members of the Korean American community received a loud and clear message 
recently from both Korean and African American community leaders: Our 
communities must learn to work together, or suffer the possibly destructive 
consequences of having a racially divided society. 
</P>
<P>
 The message came at the third in a series of four forums presented by the 
Korea Society titled "Living and Working in a Multicultural Society." The 
forums are designed to help ease the cultural isolation many Korean immigrants 
feel and that can result in a lack of understanding of mainstream American 
society and of other minority cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent forum was a discussion of the African American experience in the 
United States, with historical and present-day information provided by Los 
Angeles Urban League President John Mack and UC Riverside ethnic studies 
professor Edward Chang, who recently published the first Korean-language text 
on African American history. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to providing the audience with a historical overview of the 
African American community and the problems from which it still suffers, Mack 
and Chang stressed the importance of resisting the temptation to point fingers 
at other cultures as scapegoats for the city's social ills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must really begin to get serious in Los Angeles and in California about 
getting to know one another, getting to understand one another, and trying not 
to see one another as the enemy," Mack said. "We're all members of the human 
family. It's as simple as that, but most people aren't ready to buy into that 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Presented with the cooperation of several Koreatown community agencies, the 
series, which began in October, has attempted to put into perspective different 
aspects of American society for Korean immigrants, many of whom arrive in this 
country with a vastly different mental picture of life in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "They usually have no idea of what it's like here," said Craig Coleman, 
executive director of the Korea Society. "All they have to go on are stories 
from relatives, which usually paint a much rosier picture." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the series has presented speakers such as former City Councilman 
Michael Woo and sociologist Eui Young Yu discussing the Asian American 
political experience and how it relates to the future of the Korean American 
community, as well as La Opinion editor Rafael Bultrago and anthropologist 
Andre Simic discussing the European and Latino immigrant experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an opportunity for Korean people to have someone who knows what they're 
talking about explain these issues," said Will Braswell, a Korea Society 
spokesman.  
</P>
<P>
 The final forum, on participation in the democratic process, is scheduled for 
6 p.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the series is over, Coleman said, each guest speaker's presentation will 
be translated into Korean and published by the Korea Society in book form. 
Named after the series, the bilingual publication will serve as a sort of 
instructional handbook for Korean immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will give them helpful hints about the kinds of little things that can 
create big problems," said Coleman, who holds a doctorate in Asian American 
studies and conceived the idea in 1989 after several years of field work in the 
Korean community. 
</P>
<P>
 The handbook, which is expected to be out early next year, will be distributed 
free. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman said that a new discussion series, in which Korean community leaders 
will address members of the Latino and African American communities, is in the 
works.

MR. FEYNMAN'S DAY OFF; THE LATE NOBEL PRIZE WINNER RICHARD FEYNMAN HAD A 
PASSION FOR THE BONGOS, MISCHIEF AND PHYSICS. NOW THE FIRST MARRIAGE OF THE 
GENIUS TURNED FOLK HERO HAS BECOME AN UNLIKELY LOVE STORY FROM STAR-DIRECTOR 
MATTHEW BRODERICK.

<P>
 Physicist Richard P. Feynman was just 24 when the U.S. government recruited 
him to help invent the atomic bomb. A graduate of Princeton, where he received 
his doctorate in 1942, Feynman was already a star in the science community, 
which was dazzled by his intuitive grasp of the complex outer reaches of 
physics. Skilled at feats of mental arithmetic that left his colleagues 
scratching their heads, Feynman seemed to do physics by ear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just as you and I know there's a chair here, Richard knew the laws of physics 
and how things worked with a total, deep understanding," recalls his sister, 
Joan Feynman, who is also a scientist. "I remember him once talking about 
electromagnetic waves coming through the room -- it had a reality for him that 
it doesn't have for most people." 
</P>
<P>
 Feynman -- the subject of "Infinity," a film starring Matthew Broderick as 
Feynman and directed by Broderick in his directorial debut, and scheduled for 
release in July -- had many talents in addition to his daunting ability as a 
scientist. 
</P>
<P>
 An inspired teacher, Feynman lectured in an eccentric style that was equal 
parts homespun philosopher, stand-up comic and theoretical physicist. Arriving 
in Pasadena to teach at Caltech in 1950, he attracted a devoted following and 
was to reign as Southern California's resident genius until 1988, when he died 
of cancer at the age of 69. 
</P>
<P>
 (He was, in fact, the subject of "Genius," a best-selling biography by James 
Gleick that was published in 1992, as well as this year's "No Ordinary Genius," 
a book by Christopher Sykes.) 
</P>
<P>
 Feynman was an enthusiastic bongo player, dancer, prankster, gambler and 
locksmith and a womanizer of major repute, as well as an amateur artist of 
considerable talent -- a book of his drawings will be published next year in 
Australia. He spoke Portuguese, could decipher Mayan hieroglyphics and wrote 
two best-selling books -- "Surely You're Joking, Mr. Feynman!" (1985) and "What 
Do You Care What Other People Think?" (1988). The books, collections of stories 
of the odd adventures that seemed to blossom everywhere he went, are evocative 
of Will Rogers in their simple wisdom and indomitable optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 A cantankerous intellect of a peculiarly American sort, Feynman was rejected 
by the draft board as mentally incompetent and was resolutely apolitical -- he 
was, however, open to everything. He spent several afternoons a week for most 
of the '60s fiddling with mathematical equations at a back table in a topless 
bar in Pasadena, and he poked around at Esalen during that heady decade. He 
experimented with sensory deprivation tanks with Dr. John Lilly, and at the 
time of his death Feynman was working his way through bureaucratic red tape so 
he could visit Tuva, a tiny village in a remote region of Asia. Why did he want 
to go there? Because it was a place he knew nothing about and Feynman was a man 
with a burning desire to know . 
</P>
<P>
 As a child, when a teacher confessed that he had made up a story he told the 
class, Feynman was so upset by the sudden unreliability of all he had learned 
that he started to cry. From the start, he clearly had a deep regard for 
reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Feynman played a key role in uncovering the cause of the explosion of the 
space shuttle Challenger in 1986 and was introduced to a mainstream audience 
that year and in 1988, when he was the subject of two documentaries made by the 
BBC that aired on PBS. He won quite a few new fans at that point, many of whom 
probably had no interest whatsoever in science. Graced with the rough-hewn 
charm of a hustler, Feynman came across on camera as an intensely charismatic 
man. 
</P>
<P>
 Charming though he was, Feynman's crowning achievement will remain the flurry 
of work he did in the early '60s, often referred to as "the great cleanup," 
that led to his winning a Nobel Prize in 1965. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a revolutionary methodology known as "Feynman diagrams" (which look like 
nothing more than zigzag sketches to the untrained eye), he recast almost the 
whole of quantum mechanics and electrodynamics from his own point of view. 
Feynman's lifelong love affair with science revolved around a search for 
general principles flexible enough to be adapted to anything in the world, and 
he came amazingly close to the mark with this spate of work. 
</P>
<P>
 A colleague once described him as "an advanced life form pretending to be 
human to spare your feelings," but Feynman insisted that there was nothing 
magical in his abilities, that excelling in physics was simply a matter of 
maintaining the right attitude, focusing on observable reality, asking the 
right questions and being willing to try unconventional solutions. Feynman was 
a merciless skeptic who believed that doubt was the essence of knowing, and he 
considered phoniness and self-deception to be cardinal sins. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a child and I found out Santa Claus wasn't real, I wasn't upset," 
he once said. "Rather, I was relieved that there was a much simpler phenomenon 
to explain how so many children all over the world got presents on the same 
night." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An entirely different side of Feynman will be illuminated in "Infinity," which 
was written by Matthew Broderick's mother, Patricia Broderick. The film focuses 
on a brief period in Feynman's life -- the years from 1941 to 1945 -- when he 
married his first wife. Arlene Greenbaum, played in the film by Patricia 
Arquette, died of tuberculosis shortly before the first atomic bomb test in 
July, 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 "Infinity" is essentially a love story that unfolds against the backdrop of 
America's race to beat Germany to the bomb, and though it might seem odd to 
present Feynman's life as a love story, it is actually quite appropriate. 
Interviewed for The Times shortly before his death, Feynman was asked what he 
was most proud of in his life, and he replied: "That I was able to love my 
first wife with as deep a love as I was able to." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Matthew Broderick of his approach to Feynman's life: "The obvious way to 
structure a film about Feynman would be to open with the Challenger disaster: 
The crazy old genius comes along and figures everything out, then he drifts 
into a reverie along the lines of 'A long time ago I met a girl.. . .' We 
didn't do that, because we want this to be an intimate movie and thought 
focusing on one period of his life that includes the invention of the bomb and 
the death of his first wife was enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "We considered using little documentary moments in the film and still haven't 
completely discounted that idea," adds Broderick of the film, which was 
budgeted at $5 million and is still being shopped for U.S. distribution. "But 
the longer we've worked on it, the more intimate it's become. This is not a 
documentary -- it would cost a fortune to do a feature-length documentary of 
Feynman with any factual accuracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed it would, as Feynman was present at an awful lot of history. Swirling 
around Feynman are huge social issues such as the morality of science in the 
nuclear age, the anti-Semitism of American academia in the 1930s, the Red Scare 
of the '50s and the devastating effect it had on the scientific community, and 
the judgment of the U.S. government that led to the Challenger disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Feynman publicly chastised the National Aeronautics and Space Administration 
for overstating what it could do in an effort to get funding, telling 
officials, "You can't put public relations before reality in the realm of 
science." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Feynman was born in 1918 in Far Rockaway, N.Y., and began to learn mathematics 
from his father, a salesman for a company that manufactured uniforms, when he 
was a toddler. 
</P>
<P>
 As a schoolboy he taught himself calculus and set up his own laboratory to 
accommodate an obsession with problem-solving that ranged from finding 
solutions to hypothetical conundrums to fixing radios and typewriters. 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from high school, he earned a bachelor of science degree at 
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, then went on to receive a doctorate 
at Princeton, where he studied with theoretical physicist John Wheeler. Wheeler 
suggested to the government that Feynman be invited to participate in the 
Manhattan Project. Feynman went, and he proved himself indispensable. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are two kinds of genius," observed physicist Hans Bethe, who worked 
with Feynman at Los Alamos, N.M. "The ordinary kind does great things, but lets 
other scientists feel they could do the same if only they worked hard enough. 
The other kind performs magic. A magician does things that nobody else could 
ever do and that seem completely unexpected. And that's Feynman." 
</P>
<P>
 Before leaving for Los Alamos in 1942, Feynman married Arlene Greenbaum, who 
was ill with tuberculosis and was to spend the duration of their marriage in a 
sanitarium in Albuquerque. She died in June, 1945, about a month before the 
crowning achievement of the Manhattan Project -- the detonation of the first 
atomic bomb -- at Alamogordo, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
 Feynman often boasted that he was the only man reckless enough to watch the 
first atomic bomb test with the naked eye; oddly enough (for a man with such an 
open mind), he always refused to entertain the possibility that the presence of 
the two unusual cancers in his system that killed him might have had anything 
to do with that day at Alamogordo. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the Los Alamos scientists were thrown into a philosophical crisis by 
their success in creating the atomic bomb -- Manhattan Project Director J. 
Robert Oppenheimer, in particular, was profoundly aggrieved by what science had 
unleashed on the world. Feynman, too, went through a period of despair in the 
years after the war, which he spent teaching at Cornell University. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In 1949, Feynman left Cornell and spent a year in Brazil teaching physics, and 
in 1950 he arrived at Caltech, where he was to spend the rest of his working 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 A brief, ill-fated marriage in 1952 was followed by a third, enduring marriage 
in 1960 to Gweneth Howarth, with whom he had two children, Carl and Michelle, 
who were 26 and 20 when he died. It was they who sold the rights to this very 
rich and complex life to Patricia and Matthew Broderick; they did it hoping for 
the best -- but aware of the risks involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We sold the rights to my father's books long before the script was written, 
knowing we'd have no control over how he was depicted on screen," Carl Feynman 
says of the film, which was shot on location in Los Angeles, New Mexico, New 
York and New Jersey from July through September. "They never solicited my input 
as far as trying to remain true to who my father was, and I still haven't seen 
the script. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do know that Patricia Broderick grew up in the same neighborhood as my 
father and that she put in lots of stuff she remembered from when she was there 
-- we'll see if the film turns out to be his story or her story.  
</P>
<P>
 "Regardless if it's good or bad," he adds, "if my father had been alive 
there's no way he would have let this film be made." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Michelle Feynman, an aspiring actress who has a small part in "Infinity": 
</P>
<P>
 "Having read the script, I'd say they're allowing themselves a fair amount of 
poetic license in their interpretation of him -- they have to, though, because 
many of the people who knew him aren't around anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first script written by Patricia Broderick, who counters that "you 
can't tell the literal truth in a film, because you don't have the time. 
However, I allowed myself very little poetic license in the portrait of Feynman 
I created. I studied footage and met his friends and relatives -- and 
fortunately, I spent each August in the early '30s with an aunt who lived in 
Far Rockaway, so I have a good feeling for the world he grew up in. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also understood very well what Arlene was like because she and I are both 
artists," continues Broderick, who is a painter, as was Arlene Feynman. "And, 
oddly enough, my very best friend died at the same age Arlene died. I wanted to 
remember my friend, so I created a character that combined elements of both of 
them. I tried to give Arlene some of the qualities of my friend, Janet, who had 
a wonderful sense of humor as, I gather, Arlene did. The people who knew Arlene 
don't seem to have any objection to this, although I'm sure some people will." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among those who do object is Ralph Leighton, Feynman's best friend and the 
co-writer of his two books. 
</P>
<P>
 "Patricia refused to take suggestions from people who knew Richard and seems 
to think that because she came from the same neighborhood where he grew up, she 
didn't need any further preparation," says Leighton, who administrates the 
Friends of Tuva Club, an offbeat organization with a membership of about 750 
that is devoted to preserving the memory of Richard Feynman and increasing 
awareness of Tuva. "If Feynman had come from Staten Island, Patricia Broderick 
would never have written a film about him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I care about preserving Richard's memory, but it's not for his sake, because 
he wouldn't give a damn. I think people should get to know who he really was 
because he was such an extraordinary man." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the one point everyone seems to agree on. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone who had contact with Feynman seems to have a story to tell, and the 
stories tend to be eccentric -- at least they seem eccentric to the people 
telling them," Matthew Broderick says. "Feynman was extremely eccentric within 
the scientific community, but put him in show business and he wouldn't seem 
strange. 
</P>
<P>
 "His eccentricity isn't what drew me to his story. He had a remarkably fresh 
way of looking at everything -- he pretty much discounted whatever he was told 
and always insisted on looking for himself and coming to his own conclusions.  
</P>
<P>
 "I also found the story of his first marriage profoundly moving -- he married 
Arlene over the objections of his friends and family, knowing she was going to 
die. And, finally, Feynman was on the front lines of so much of the history of 
this century. However you look at it, it was a remarkable life."

 If not for Chinese inventor Cai Lun, what you're reading right now might have 
been etched in stone. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 2,000 years ago, after years of trial and error, Lun threw together 
some rags, rope ends, worn-out fishing nets and tree bark.  
</P>
<P>
 He soaked the stringy combination in water and when the soggy mess dried, Lun 
had come up with the first paper as we know it today. 
</P>
<P>
 Because most people don't think of Lun when they dump their newspapers into 
recycling bins, the Asian Pacific Mart imported the Chinese Science & Arts Expo 
from Beijing to familiarize Americans with China's 7,000-year history.  
</P>
<P>
 "All the inventions here on display were invented by the Chinese, but they 
belong to the world," the show's director, Jin Wan Quan, said through an 
interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
 And the display is plentiful. 
</P>
<P>
 Grace Wu, 12, and her girlfriends raced from exhibit to exhibit in the hall, 
which is the size of a football field. Of all the inventions and artifacts, she 
was most impressed with "the earthquake machine." 
</P>
<P>
 Wu was referring to the replica of the earliest-known seismograph. Resembling 
a six-foot urn, it could detect when an earthquake hit and determine the 
direction of the epicenter. It was invented in AD 132. 
</P>
<P>
 When the earth shook, a bar delicately balanced inside fell in the direction 
of the movement, causing one of eight bronze dragons attached to the urn's base 
to spit out a tiny ball.  
</P>
<P>
 The ball fell into the mouth of one of the eight bronze toads that circle the 
urn. 
</P>
<P>
 A resounding bong then sounded the alert that an earthquake had occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 The device could detect a temblor up to 500 miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit also brings to life the ancient Chinese arts by including masters 
in papermaking, painting and silk embroidery who perform their crafts at 
various tables. Visitors are even invited to try their hand at sculpting and 
rub printing. 
</P>
<P>
 Eileen Ng, 11, was excited about making paper.  
</P>
<P>
 She watched as a master papermaker dipped a fine bamboo screen into boiled 
bamboo pulp and lifted it evenly to obtain a thin layer of the milky liquid. He 
pressed the pulp to squeeze out the excess water. While the pulp layer was 
still wet, the craftsman peeled it off the screen and hung it on the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Once dry, Ng had a piece of handmade paper on which a master artist painted 
something for her. 
</P>
<P>
 But although the girls may have been taken with the various Chinese 
inventions, including gunpowder, the compass and the first printing device, 
they spent most of their time rubbing the handles of a 10th-Century bronze 
basin. They were hoping to see the water vibrate and spout upward, which was 
said to have amused the emperor centuries ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit is a joint venture between the Bi-Pacific Exhibiting and Marketing 
Co. Inc., which owns the Asian Pacific Mart, and the Beijing National Science 
and Technology Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 It cost more than $200,000 to transport the four containers holding the 
exhibit to the Mart, at 1100 S. Flower St., and thousands more to upgrade the 
show, but Dan Lin, general manager of the Mart, said the cost was well worth 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not always about money. We're building mutual understanding, building 
friendship," said Lin. 
</P>
<P>
 The show continues through Jan. 31. BRETT MAHONEY

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: ECHO PARK; GROCERY BAGS CARRY MESSAGE OF LITERACY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pioneer Market, the only supermarket in the mostly Spanish-speaking Echo Park 
neighborhood west of downtown, began distributing grocery bags printed with 
essays by students from the adult literacy program of Centro Latino de 
Educacion Popular, a nonprofit organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who do not know how to read cannot have any privacy and have to ask 
others for favors to write their letters.That is very humiliating," wrote one 
72-year-old contributor, Concepcion. "I have come out of that ignorance." 
</P>
<P>
 The main idea, said board member Melanie Stephens, is to let people in the 
neighborhood know about the classes, which have helped about 100 students since 
they began in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "No. 2 is to let the larger community of Los Angeles be able to appreciate the 
life stories of newly literate adult students, because many of them don't get 
to be heard in any other way," Stephens said. 
</P>
<P>
 One writer, Carlos, told of growing up on a ranch where the owner kept all the 
children out of school to work. Concepcion told of an early life of "children 
and problems" that kept her from getting an education. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies have shown that more than 300,000 people in Los Angeles never got past 
the fourth grade. Spanish speakers who cannot read or write face a double 
disadvantage in learning English. 
</P>
<P>
 "What holds most of them back is that it's extremely difficult to learn a 
foreign language unless you have basic reading and writing skills in your own 
language," Stephens said.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; THANKSGIVING MEAL TO SHOW OFF SHELTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They set a bigger table for Thanksgiving dinner this year at the Union Rescue 
Mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they will not officially begin serving the homeless in their new home 
at 545 S. San Pedro St. until Dec. 12, mission staff members threw open the 
doors of their state-of-the-art facility and invited 4,000 of the less 
fortunate for Thanksgiving dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Their shopping list looked something like this: 140 turkeys, 750 pounds of 
sweet potatoes, 600 pounds of green beans, 150 pounds of cranberry sauce, 100 
gallons of gravy, 700 pounds of stuffing, 4,000 rolls and, for dessert, 460 
pumpkin pies.  
</P>
<P>
 Mission staffers anticipated serving about 1,000 more people this year than 
they did last year in their present dining room, which is tiny compared to 
their new one that can seat 600 people at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite some concerns about their new neighborhood, it is this increased 
capacity to serve the needy that has convinced mission staffers that the move 
from their 68-year-old home near of Main and 2nd streets is a good one. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will have more beds so that people won't be forced to sleep on hard 
plastic chairs. Everything we need is in that building," said Michael Teague, 
mission's chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission has beds for about 400 men. An additional 200 or so men find 
refuge in the shelter's chapel each night. They sleep on chairs.  
</P>
<P>
 With 235,000 square feet, the new mission will be one of the largest shelters 
in the nation. It can hold up to 810 dormitory beds for transients and 
longer-term residents enrolled in a substance abuse recovery program.  
</P>
<P>
 The new space also allows the mission to offer services for women, beyond 
short-term emergency care, for the first time. One hundred beds have been 
reserved for them and room has been allocated for 12 cribs. 
</P>
<P>
 Deborah Munoz, manager of women's services, said it was critical to do 
something to meet their needs because the female population on Skid Row is 
growing. 
</P>
<P>
 Munoz was helping Patricia Thornton, 36, find a gift for her son, who just had 
his first birthday.  
</P>
<P>
 Thornton, who lives on Skid Row, is struggling to stabilize her life and kick 
her alcohol dependency so that she can win her two children back from foster 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad the mission is moving. Women need a place to stay down here. A place 
where a woman can feel like a woman," Thornton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new five-floor building also has a health care facility, a 400-seat 
chapel, classrooms and a basketball court. Its price tag was $29 million, 
funded with a $6.5-million community redevelopment grant and private donations. 
</P>
<P>
 The new mission, however, is in the heart of Skid Row, where drug trafficking 
and crime are rampant. The mission has doubled its security by hiring 20 more 
guards. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a more hardened clientele may join the mission's regular patrons, 
staffers are confident that they will be able to maintain a safe environment. 
</P>
<P>
 When the move was announced, some of their new neighbors complained about the 
growing concentration of shelters in their area and worried that sidewalk 
encampments and crime would increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we are helping to make that community safer," Teague said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission security guards will patrol around the shelter's entrances on San 
Julian and San Pedro streets. Because of the many resources inside the mission 
-- including a courtyard where those who do not have beds may sleep safely -- 
Teague said he does not think more homeless people will be camping out in the 
area.  
</P>
<P>
 Teague added that the number of homeless service centers in the neighborhood 
is an asset because they can coordinate resources.  
</P>
<P>
 The mission used to serve three hot meals a day, but at the new location it 
will serve only two, along with a light snack in the evening. Teague said meals 
are available in so many of the other shelters in the neighborhood that the 
mission can cut back.

COVER STORY; CRANKING UP THE VOLUME; ROBERT RODRIGUEZ MADE 'EL MARIACHI' WITH A 
BORROWED CAMERA ON A WHEELCHAIR DOUBLING AS A DOLLY. NOW HIS SECOND FILM HAS 
BIG STARS, A BIG BUDGET -- AND LOTS OF REALLY EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Joe Leydon, Joe Leydon is the film critic for the Houston Post. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Get a load of this: Antonio Banderas, all decked out in bandit black, 
scampering across the bar in a dingy cantina, a blazing pistol in either hand, 
mowing down bad guys as he twirls his arms this way, that way, any way, like a 
flamboyant bullfighter facing death in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Filmmaker Robert Rodriguez can't help grinning at his own handiwork as the 
action explodes across the twin video monitors. 
</P>
<P>
 " Awwww riiiight !" he exclaims, turning up the volume on the Lightworks 
editing unit. "You know, we can't get a stunt double for Banderas. Nobody can 
move like this guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez's voice is drowned out by another volley of gunfire. On the video 
screens, Banderas is allowing the bad guys to take their best shots. "You 
missed me!" he jeers at a particularly poor marksman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, the Mariachi never misses," Rodriguez notes. "He just keeps coming 
up with these new shooting techniques. This movement here -- we call this 'The 
Whip.' And it works, see. The bullets go around corners and hit people." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez pushes another button on the console; another image appears on the 
twin monitors. Would you look at that: It's Quentin Tarantino, the exuberant 
auteur of "Reservoir Dogs" and "Pulp Fiction," trying to talk his way out of a 
dangerous situation. He's in the back room of the bar, trying to score a drug 
deal with a couple of thugs, when Banderas begins to blast away bad guys. The 
thugs in the back room think Tarantino has set them up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, man," Tarantino desperately explains, "I had nothing to do with . . . " 
Blam! A single gunshot to the forehead ends his conversation. Tarantino appears 
to die as messily as a character in one of his own movies.  
</P>
<P>
 "See that?" Rodriguez asks, beaming with pride. "Let me show you again. This 
is a real cool editing system. They made this stuff real easy so, like, you 
learn to work it in a half-hour." 
</P>
<P>
 But isn't it ironic that this Lightworks system, this network of monitors and 
disc drives and whatnot that takes up most of a motel room, costs more than the 
entire budget of Rodriguez's first movie? 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you kidding?" Rodriguez replies. He picks up, seemingly at random, a 
small black rectangular box that looks like a CD player you would connect to 
your living room stereo. "Man, this alone cost more than 'El Mariachi.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Well, yes. Three years ago, Rodriguez filmed "El Mariachi," his debut feature, 
in the hard-scrabble border town of Acuna, Mexico, just down the road and 
across the Rio Grande, on a frayed-shoestring budget of $7,225. Now he has 
returned to the scene of the crime with nearly 1,000 times that amount, to film 
a new adventure for Columbia Pictures.  
</P>
<P>
 Now he can afford the star power, the production values and the 
post-production hardware he couldn't afford last time. In fact, just about the 
only thing he's lacking -- so far, at least -- is a title for his latest 
effort. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on what day this is or who you ask, the new movie Rodriguez recently 
wrapped in Acuna, due out early next summer, is titled either "Pistolero" or 
"The Return of the Mariachi." Or maybe "Desperado," even though only the 
Hollywood Reporter and Exhibitor Relations have ever referred to it as such. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually," producer Bill Borden joked one morning during breakfast at an 
Acuna location, "I think that when it comes out next summer, we should have on 
the poster 'Pistolero: The Return of the Mariachi Desperado.' Just go ahead and 
call it everything it's ever been called." 
</P>
<P>
 By any name, it will have a tough act to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For the benefit of those who tuned in late: Two years ago, Rodriguez 
astonished film festival-goers at Toronto and Telluride with "El Mariachi," the 
stripped-to-essentials yarn that he filmed with a borrowed camera, a minimum of 
props and a handful of friends. For all its rough edges, the movie -- a 
fast-paced, no-frills adventure about a mariachi musician who's mistaken for a 
vengeful hit man -- was immediately recognized as a work of considerable 
accomplishment and exceptional promise. Just as important, the story behind the 
movie's production was the stuff of Hollywood legend and film-school fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time he made it, Rodriguez was a University of Texas film student with 
an audacious plan for extracurricular activities. According to the original 
scenario, Rodriguez, a San Antonio native, and Carlos Gallardo, a friend and UT 
classmate, would film three micro-budget action flicks about a 
mariachi-turned-vigilante. They would make the movies back-to-back -- selling 
the first to pay for the second, then the second to pay for the third -- for 
the Spanish video market. That way, they could gain all the benefits of 
hands-on experience without risking the embarrassment of having a potential 
employer actually see the mistakes they made. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figured no one (in Hollywood) would ever rent it," Rodriguez, who is now 
26, says. "I mean, do you ever go to the Spanish video market and rent a movie? 
And even if you did, would you ever rent an action movie called 'The Guitar 
Player'? 
</P>
<P>
 "I never even intended to make a print of ("El Mariachi"). I just wanted 
something that looked like a real film, that I edited on video, so I could sell 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 But in December, 1991, while in Los Angeles to negotiate with video 
distributors, Rodriguez figured, what the heck, while he was in the 
neighborhood, he might as well leave a calling card or two. So he dropped off 
one of his award-winning student short films and a makeshift trailer for "El 
Mariachi" with International Creative Management. The tape greatly impressed 
ICM's Robert Newman, who signed Rodriguez to an agency contract, then sent 
cassettes of "El Mariachi" to every major studio in town. 
</P>
<P>
 Much to Rodriguez's surprise, Columbia Pictures signed the young filmmaker to 
a two-year development deal. And much to his astonishment, the studio also made 
an offer to buy and distribute "El Mariachi." 
</P>
<P>
 "At first," Rodriguez admits, "I didn't want that to happen. What I did, I 
didn't think it was a movie. I thought it was just fooling around with the 
camera. I told the Columbia people, 'Look, it's just a home movie.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the Columbia brass disagreed. The studio successfully tested a technically 
enhanced version of Rodriguez's movie at the 1992 Toronto and Telluride 
festivals -- where Rodriguez became friendly with Tarantino and actor Steve 
Buscemi, who were then busy publicizing "Reservoir Dogs," and who agreed to 
appear in Rodriguez's next film. By the time "El Mariachi" won the Audience 
Award for favorite film at the Sundance Film Festival in January, 1993, 
Rodriguez was willing to admit that his extracurricular project might attract 
ticket buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The unlikely rise of Rodriguez and his no-budget movie became a much-hyped 
Cinderella story. But a key detail somehow got overlooked in most of the press 
coverage after "El Mariachi" hit theaters in early 1993: The ending of this 
fairy tale wasn't nearly so happy as most people assumed. 
</P>
<P>
 "El Mariachi" wound up grossing "only about $1.8 million," producer Borden 
says. "Now, if you look at it in terms of percentages -- the movie only cost 
$7,000, and then Columbia put a couple of hundred thousand into finishing it, 
bringing it up to 35mm and re-dubbing it so you could release it in big 
theaters. Well, you know, to invest a couple of hundred thousand dollars into a 
movie that returned $1.8 million was not such a bad investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the reality of that investment is, it didn't make them any money. Because 
by the time you put in the cost of (prints and advertising), and flying Robert 
around for all the publicity trips and all that stuff, it was a break-even 
proposition." 
</P>
<P>
 All of which goes a long way toward explaining why the folks involved with 
Rodriguez's latest effort -- including Rodriguez himself -- are more than a 
little ambivalent about what to call the new film, and how closely to associate 
it with its predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly," Borden says, "the first film has a name value that's sort of 
seeped into the moviegoing community. . . . And it seemed to have done a lot 
better than it really did, because of the stories that followed it. 
</P>
<P>
 "So the decision to invest substantially more money in this sequel was 
actually a fairly easy choice. Because you had a new, young, talented director. 
And you had 'El Mariachi,' which has definitely made its mark on the public, 
and has been very successful as a videocassette, as a rental item." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 'Pistolero" -- the title that appeared on the scripts that circulated 
throughout fall shooting in Acuna -- is intended as a sequel that can stand on 
its own. Or as Rodriguez puts it: "This is what 'The Road Warrior' was to 'Mad 
Max.' It's like, the same character in a different movie. If you didn't see the 
first movie, it doesn't matter. You can still have a good time with this one." 
</P>
<P>
 The second movie has a hot property in the lead role: Antonio Banderas, the 
Spanish-born hunk who has managed the tricky transition from imported art-house 
fare ("Matador," "Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down!") to mainstream American movies 
("Philadelphia," "Interview With the Vampire"). Banderas takes over the job 
from Rodriguez's partner, Carlos Gallardo, who is content this time to remain 
on the other side of the cameras as associate producer with Elizabeth Avellan, 
Rodriguez's wife. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to make another movie with a Latin hero," says Rodriguez, the third 
of 10 children of a close-knit Mexican American family. "A movie that was 
bigger (than "El Mariachi"), that would go around the world and be seen. And it 
just seemed easier to me, because there were no other scripts around like this, 
to just use this character again to accomplish that." 
</P>
<P>
 For all his jocularity, Rodriguez fully realizes that there's more riding on 
his second feature than merely the question of whether he can survive the 
sophomore jinx. With all due respect to Edward James Olmos, "who has always 
been an inspiration to me," and Luis Valdez, who made "La Bamba" with producer 
Bill Borden, "You see hardly any Mexican American filmmakers," Rodriguez said. 
"And their movies come out only once in a while. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think if ('Mariachi 2') would be successful enough, if it made enough 
money, other Latino movies would be made. It's like with African American 
films. As soon as Spike Lee made his movies, everyone was giving checks for 
other black filmmakers to come up. And they started making great films. And 
that opened up a whole new market. 
</P>
<P>
 "It comes to a point where you realize, 'I'm going to have to step forward and 
try and be a role model, because nobody else seems to be wanting to. Or if they 
are, they're pretty well hidden.' " 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the first "El Mariachi," the hero was seriously wounded by the 
bad guys, and left unable to play his beloved guitar. Even so, the wound wasn't 
so serious that he couldn't transform himself into a heavily armed avenger. 
Which is exactly what he has become as "The Sequel With No Title" begins. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," Banderas jokes in his heavily accented English, "the audience may say, 
'Hey, this guy, he can't play the guitar anymore, but he can shoot people like 
hell.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not killing just one guy once in a while. I go into a bar, and I kill 20 
guys at once. So it's over the top. The movie starts, and in 20 minutes, I kill 
about 40 guys in two different bars." 
</P>
<P>
 Banderas' Mariachi is a one-man army who wages war on Mexican drug dealers, 
who travels everywhere with a lethal array of weapons in his seemingly 
innocuous guitar case. His only allies: Buscemi (played, appropriately enough, 
by Steve Buscemi), El Mariachi's advance scout, and Carolina (Mexican 
television star Salma Hayek), a bookstore owner. Number One on El Mariachi's 
want-to-hit list: Bucho, a suave but sinister crime lord who has more in common 
with El Mariachi than either man suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, Raul Julia was cast as Bucho, and the entire shooting schedule had 
been plotted around his availability. But shortly after he suffered the stroke 
that preceded his death Oct. 24, Julia was replaced with Argentine actor 
Joaquim de Almeida ("Clear and Present Danger," "Only You"). On the day Julia's 
death was announced on the Acuna location, producer Borden led the cast and 
crew in a moment of respectful silence. After that brief reminder of mortality, 
it was back to the world of blood squibs and fake deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 "This movie will be as wild as anything Sam Peckinpah ever dreamed of," 
promises Bob Shelley, a veteran special-effects coordinator working on the 
sequel. More important, from Columbia's point of view, the mayhem is being 
accomplished at cut-rate prices. Rodriguez, who often placed his camera on a 
wheelchair for dolly shots in "El Mariachi," has remained true to his 
low-budget roots here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got an item that Robert's nicknamed the Guacamole Gun," Shelley says. 
"We couldn't afford a lot of prosthetics on this show. So what he's done is, 
since we shoot a lot of people in the forehead, he's rigged this gun that will 
shoot out a tremendous amount of blood. We can hit the guy in the forehead, or 
in the back of the head, and it looks like we blow their brains out. But if you 
look real close, you can see the blood flying toward them. So what Robert does 
is, he edits out one or two frames, and the flying blood is gone." 
</P>
<P>
 And what remains, Rodriguez insists, really isn't all that graphic. At least, 
not so graphic that he's worried about an NC-17 rating. "It was such a goof 
while I was shooting this stuff, I never took any of it seriously," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On and off the set, Rodriguez dresses like a grunge rocker -- bandanna, baggy 
shorts, wrinkled shirt, scuffed sneakers -- and moves with the sleepy ease of a 
bear recently awakened from hibernation. But while directing his movie by day 
on location in Acuna, or editing a rough cut by night in his Del Rio motel 
room, he often sounds like a 33 1/3-r.p.m. record that some prankster has 
revved up to 78. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the movie comes out," he mock-seriously promises, slipping into the 
voice of a TV pitchman, "we'll have our very own action figures! You'll see the 
commercials, and it'll be, 'El Mariachi and his missile-firing guitar case! 
Batteries not included!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from the mood of his cast and crew, Rodriguez's enthusiasm is highly 
contagious. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way Robert understands action, he's like a kid," Banderas says. "And in a 
way, he's an actor's dream. An actor is someone who probably stopped growing 
up, and decided to be a kid forever, playing games. And that's what I'm doing 
here: things that I saw on TV when I was a kid -- that I wanted to do when I 
was a kid." 
</P>
<P>
 When Banderas and his wife, Ana Leza, saw the first "El Mariachi" in a 
Hollywood screening room, "I thought, 'This guy has incredible energy,' " the 
actor says. "It reminds me of the first films I did with (Pedro) Almodovar. Not 
in his style, of course. But it's like, you know, the same thing, when you 
don't have any money and you're working outside the studio, with no trailer, no 
nothing, just waiting on the corner to do your shot. And I thought, 'Wow! 
That's the kind of cinema I would like to do again.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez insists that success hasn't spoiled him so far, and isn't likely to 
in the future. He and his wife still live in Austin, far away from L.A., in a 
conspicuously unglamorous apartment. And while he's enjoying the relative ease 
of directing a film bankrolled by a Hollywood studio, he claims that if his 
second "Mariachi" is a financial dud, he can always go back to making movies 
with borrowed cameras mounted on wheelchairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Rodriguez admits there is something to be said for having a bigger 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were making 'El Mariachi,' we didn't have any money," Rodriguez says. 
"So, in order to have something to drink between takes, we wound up buying this 
Gatorade powder. And since we didn't have very much, we had to mix it with a 
lot of water. A lot of water." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez smiles at the memory. Then he grabs a plastic bottle of the sports 
drink -- full-strength, premixed stuff, purchased in a Del Rio convenience 
store -- and takes a healthy swig. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now," he says, "we can get real Gatorade. That's how far we've come."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: SOUTH GATE; EMERGENCY FUNDS HELP 2 LIBRARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIMON ROMERO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks to an emergency allocation of funds from the County Board of 
Supervisors, South Gate's two beleaguered libraries have increased the number 
of days and hours they are open. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the 87-branch county system, the Hollydale and Weaver libraries will 
be open five days a week for 30 hours, and 6 days a week for 50 hours, 
respectively. The new library hours began two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hollydale Library had only been open two days a week and Weaver Library 
was only open four days a week. Both stopped buying new books and materials two 
years ago when the state withdrew half of the county library system's funding 
and allocated it to schools statewide instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very grateful to the board for this reprieve," Hollydale librarian 
Agnes Holt said. "But unfortunately it's only temporary and doesn't solve our 
long-term financial problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Without the county's emergency allocation the Weaver Library's hours would 
have been curtailed further and the Hollydale Library would have been closed. 
Ten county libraries have been closed in the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's last-minute allocation last month is only a stopgap measure 
because the funds only last until the end of this fiscal year, June 30, 1995, 
Holt said. Then the library system will have to renew the search for funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's decision to draw money from the general fund will allow the 
rehiring of hundreds of library workers who were laid off during the last two 
years. About 55 full-time workers and 200 part-time workers will be rehired 
during the next few months, County Librarian Margaret Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both South Gate branches will rehire workers, Wong said, but it is unclear how 
many. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, county officials hope to return most of the system's 87 libraries 
to full seven-day-a-week operating schedules and resume regular purchases of 
books. 
</P>
<P>
 Before county funding was approved, more than half of the county's libraries 
were open two days a week and even the largest, such as the Huntington Park 
branch, were open four days a week. 
</P>
<P>
 At the urging of Supervisor Gloria Molina, the board allocated $22.5 million 
from general funds instead of implementing an approved countywide community 
facilities district assessment, which would have taxed households and 
businesses in unincorporated parts of the county, as well as in cities that 
chose to participate in the assessment.  
</P>
<P>
 Only 16 cities had chosen to participate in the assessment, which would have 
taxed single-family households $28.50 a year and businesses several hundreds of 
dollars a year, depending on their size. The assessment would have raised an 
estimated $16 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate had chosen not to participate in the assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 "When June rolls around we'll have to start the whole funding procedure all 
over again," Wong said. "If it turns out we have to go with the assessment 
again, then we would have to try to convince each and every city to 
participate." 
</P>
<P>
 New library hours for Hollydale Library, 12000 S. Garfield Ave., (310) 
634-0156, are noon to 8 p.m. Tuesdays; noon to 6 p.m. Wednesdays and Thursdays; 
noon to 5 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays. Hours for Weaver Library, 4035 Tweedy 
Blvd., (213) 567-8853, are 10 a.m. to 8 p.m. Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays; 
10 a.m. to 6 p.m. Thursdays; 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. Fridays; noon to 5 p.m. 
Saturdays. SIMON ROMERO

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: BOYLE HEIGHTS; HOSPITAL'S GARDEN HELPS PATIENTS HEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Green peppers peek out from the bushes and gold and yellow marigolds brighten 
the center of a small garden at White Memorial Medical Center -- hoed, planted 
and watered by rehabilitation patients learning to speak and move again after a 
stroke or other debilitating illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The garden was dedicated Nov. 17 in honor of the two former patients, Don 
Brown and Cora Burrell, who began the project five months ago.  
</P>
<P>
 "We took a hoe and reached so far," said Brown, 57, demonstrating how the 
movements improved his strength and coordination. "It helps with the muscles, 
digging the holes and planting." He suffered a stroke and was a patient from 
April to September. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, sitting in a wheelchair decorated with blue and white balloons for the 
dedication, said the garden gave him something to look forward to after 
difficult therapy sessions. When he was admitted to the hospital, his left side 
was paralyzed and he was not able to speak, eat or even brush his teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 But slowly, with therapy, he developed his muscles and eventually started to 
feel too confined in the ward that cares for 21 patients. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Burrell asked for tools and strawberry seeds to start a planter on 
their fourth-floor patio. They replaced some geraniums growing there and were 
so successful with their strawberries that people would come by and eat them 
off the plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they asked for a bigger space, an actual plot of land where they could 
plant vegetables and flowers. The small plot, in the shape of a diamond, was 
covered with ivy that had to be pulled out to make way for their garden. A tall 
ficus tree on the eastern corner shades the plot that lies in the heart of the 
medical center. 
</P>
<P>
 "To get out into the fresh air helps a lot," Brown said. At home, he plans to 
start a pot of strawberries with the tools the hospital gave him in 
appreciation for helping start the garden. 
</P>
<P>
 "They started a tradition because even yesterday some of the patients were out 
there pulling the weeds and cleaning (the garden)," program manager Cassie 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The speech and recreation therapists in the rehabilitation center discovered 
that the garden has helped patients find a connection between the tasks they do 
in therapy and practical, everyday chores like gardening. 
</P>
<P>
 It has also motivated patients who are often discouraged by what at times 
seems impossible: getting back their mobility and independence. 
</P>
<P>
 "They see that the other patients did this when they were here, and it gives 
them motivation to stay with it," said Laura Gudbrandsen, a recreation 
therapist. "Not everyone has such strong motivation as they did, and that I 
think is the most important thing about the garden." 
</P>
<P>
 The plot has also become a favorite spot for mental health patients and staff 
members who sit on nearby benches and watch the garden's progress. Along with 
the peppers and marigolds are beets, Brussels sprouts, basil, mint, tomatoes, 
lettuce, green and white onions, jalapeno and serrano chilies, broccoli and 
celery. 
</P>
<P>
 As the vegetables ripen, the patients make salad, soup and salsa from their 
harvests. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at it and I'm still amazed at it," Gudbrandsen said. "All this work 
that they did. It's inspiring that they were able to put aside everything else 
and do this." MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EAST LOS ANGELES; SPEAKERS ON LEAD POISONING SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Volunteers are needed to learn how to be community speakers to teach parent 
groups and others about lead poisoning. 
</P>
<P>
 The East/Northeast Networking Roundtable, a group of Eastside educators and 
health and social workers, will offer a free daylong workshop Dec. 8 to teach 
volunteers to talk to community, church and parent groups about the dangers of 
lead poisoning in the development of children. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1988 report of the California Commission for Economic Development estimated 
that 350,000 California children may have lead poisoning. One of the main 
sources of lead is old homes, built usually before 1950. Los Angeles County has 
40% of the state's old housing stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Other sources include paint, tainted soil, home remedies, cosmetics from other 
countries and hobbies such as soldering, stained glass and ceramics. 
</P>
<P>
 Lead poisoning can cause brain damage and neurological problems. Some of the 
symptoms include hearing loss, fatigue, sleeplessness and loss of appetite. 
</P>
<P>
 Health officials believe many learning disorders may be the result of lead 
poisoning, but if parents and teachers do not know how to detect the symptoms 
and have the child tested, the problems can get worse, said Fernando Bravo, 
public health administrator for the Roybal Comprehensive Health Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Children are at a special risk because their bodies are still developing and 
more easily absorb the lead. Babies are especially susceptible because they put 
more objects that may contain lead, including toys, into their mouths as part 
of their normal development.  
</P>
<P>
 The workshop is from 8:30 a.m. to 4 p.m. at Centro Maravilla, 4716 Cesar E. 
Chavez Ave. Space is limited and registration is required. Deadline to register 
is Dec. 1.

 The 20th annual East Los Angeles Christmas Parade starts at 1 p.m. today, 
continuing a tradition started by Whittier Boulevard merchants and the East Los 
Angeles Jaycees in response to Vietnam War-era unrest. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1.6-mile parade will begin at the corner of Whittier Boulevard and Eastern 
Avenue and head east to Atlantic Boulevard, south to Olympic Boulevard and east 
again to its terminus at Goodrich Boulevard.Organizers expect 350 participants 
in the two-hour-long parade and 300,000 onlookers along the route. Last year's 
event brought out an estimated 250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the parade will be high school marching bands and grand marshals 
Tony Plana and Aida Mares, actors who have been involved in the parade for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior grand marshals will be Gabriela Ordaz, 12, and Eddie Muniz, 13. Both 
are involved in the East Los Angeles Youth Leadership Council, which cleans up 
neighborhoods and seeks ways to reduce dropout and pregnancy rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordaz, who attends Belvedere Middle School, spearheaded a program there in 
which older students are mentors for younger ones. Merchants and other 
communityactivists organized the parade tobring peace to the neighborhoodafter 
student walkouts protestingthe Vietnam War exploded into ariot. MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: USC; 3 STUDENTS HURT AS FIRE HITS DORMITORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A fire apparently started by a candle damaged a dormitory and caused minor 
injuries to three students early Wednesday at USC, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire broke out in the eight-story Birnkrant Residence Hall shortly after 
dawn.Firefighters evacuated the hall, where about 150 students were staying 
during the Thanksgiving break, said campus police Lt. David Ritch. 
</P>
<P>
 Flames enveloped one dorm room and spread down a hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics treated three students for smoke inhalation, and one was taken to 
California Medical Center with minor burns to her upper body, Ritch said. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze was extinguished in about 10 minutes, said Assistant Fire Chief Tony 
Ennis. Damage was estimated at $200,000 to $350,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire's cause was under investigation, but Ritch said the unidentified 
student who was sent to the hospital told investigators the fire was sparked by 
a candle in her second-floor room.  
</P>
<P>
 The student told investigators she tried to put out the fire with a pillow, 
but flames spread into the hall when she went to activate an alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 Ennis said the flames spread about 100 feet down the hallway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the students were telling us that the fire was moving about as fast 
as you can walk down the hall," Ritch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyler Lees, a freshman shivering outside the dorm in a cowboy hat, T-shirt and 
shorts, said at first he thought the alarm was a drill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right when I opened the door, there was a lot of smoke. It smelled," said 
Lees, who lives on the fifth floor. "We almost couldn't get downstairs. The 
smoke kind of burned your lungs."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: CRENSHAW; IN INDUSTRIAL AREA, A RAIN FOREST THRIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Felicia Fisher decided last year to relocate her fine furniture 
restoration and manufacturing business to the Crenshaw district, friends in the 
industry issued dire predictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't think it was feasible," recalled Fisher. "They said the community 
just couldn't support this kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, Fisher is having the last laugh. Rain Forest, at 4521 Jefferson 
Blvd. in an industrial area east of La Brea Avenue, is thriving. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher and business partner Luis Aravena arrived with a scant three accounts 
and now boast more than 200. Most of the clients are homeowners in Baldwin 
Hills, View Park, Ladera Heights and other affluent pockets of the Crenshaw 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher, who is African American, said the company's success is particularly 
gratifying because the elegant goods she and Aravena design and produce are not 
usually associated with the largely black clientele Rain Forest has cultivated. 
</P>
<P>
 The community not only provides a good client base, said Aravena, but it is 
also full of talented people that Rain Forest counts among its 12 furniture 
makers, manufacturers and other employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the opportunity, anyone can learn to do this work," said the Chilean 
native, seated on a plush, richly upholstered sofa in Rain Forest's showroom. 
</P>
<P>
 "The riots brought a lot of talk and photo opportunities for politicians, but 
who is really investing in the communities? Businesses need to come here." 
</P>
<P>
 The 4-year-old company restores and custom-makes sofas, chairs, cabinets, 
armoires and antique reproductions. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher said she moved from Alameda Street near Slauson Avenue to Crenshaw 
after the sour economy forced her to reassess company goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Rain Forest was doing poorly after losing several plum accounts with 
furniture chain stores that went out of business, Fisher and Aravena decided to 
make a fresh start. 
</P>
<P>
 Rain Forest is now one of the few but growing number of minority-owned 
businesses along the industrial corridor on Jefferson.  
</P>
<P>
 "I realized that if we waited for big accounts to come back around, we would 
die," recalled Fisher, anex-model and fashion designer who helped found the 
year-old Society of African American Interior Designers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rain Forest not only recycles its dollars in the community, it also recycles 
its wood waste. 
</P>
<P>
 All wood byproducts except sawdust are used in a packaging system of Rain 
Forest's own design that eliminates the need for environmentally unfriendly 
Styrofoam. 
</P>
<P>
 Aravena said he hopes that consumers realize that fine, one-of-a-kind wares do 
not have to be imported to be of high quality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people think that furniture like this is from Europe, from countries 
like Italy," he said. "They don't realize that we sell it and make it right 
here." ERIN J. AUBRY

 As temperatures drop and winter rains approach, homeless are beginning to seek 
shelter from the cold wherever they can. Some venture under freeways. Others 
set up homes of cardboard boxes or seek out abandoned buildings. The lucky ones 
camp out on a friend's couch for a night. 
</P>
<P>
 Every winter tests the survival skills of Los Angeles' poor and homeless. In 
South Los Angeles, the problem is acutely felt because of the lack of available 
shelters and resources for homeless in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it's cold and rainy, encampments aren't physically viable shelters for 
people," said Marjorie Gellhorn Sa'adah, executive director of Homeless Health 
Care. "They need a more stable place to stay, even if it's only temporarily." 
</P>
<P>
 For five of Los Angeles' coldest months, beds are provided in designated 
shelters around the city through the cold-wet weather program. This year, the 
program has made an additional 2,000 beds available for homeless adults seeking 
shelter from inclement weather. 
</P>
<P>
 The program started Monday and will run until March. From now until Dec. 12, 
the emergency beds will be open in case of rain or 40-degree temperatures or 
below. The shelters will operate continuously from Dec. 13 to Feb. 28 and then 
will be available only in inclement weather through March.  
</P>
<P>
 The Panama Hotel in Downtown will also open 100 rooms for people living in 
encampments. All of the beds are for single homeless men and women and homeless 
families needing shelter will receive motel and hotel vouchers.  
</P>
<P>
 According to a 1992-93 study by Shelter Partnership Inc., about 40,000 people 
are on the streets of Los Angeles on any given night.

COVER STORY; A LITTLE BIT OF HEAVEN ON EARTH; VOLUNTEERS AT CHURCHES AND 
SYNAGOGUES GIVE THE BEST OF THEMSELVES WHERE IT IS NEEDED THE MOST. SOME SEE 
THEMSELVES AS LAY SERVANTS OF GOD.

<P>
 FROM PULPITS THROUGHOUT THE area, the holiday message will go out: Think of 
the less fortunate, share your blessings, give generously of your time and your 
pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 But some in the Los Angeles religious community need no prodding. They are 
volunteers -- unsung heroes working year-round, doing everything from stuffing 
envelopes to masterminding food programs for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, the motivation is feeling useful or assuaging guilt. But others 
often see themselves as lay servants of God, called by Him to help their 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless, their congregations and communities find them indispensable, said 
Michael Mata, director of the Urban Leadership Institute at Claremont College's 
School of Theology, which trains church leaders to revitalize their communities 
and congregations through the lay community. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, almost half of all adults performed at least some volunteer work 
in 1993, down from 54% in 1989, according to a 1994 Gallup survey, which 
attributed the slip in part to concerns about the weak economy. Volunteers give 
an average of 4.2 hours a week, with members of religious organizations more 
than twice as likely to volunteer than those who have no affiliation, the 
survey said. 
</P>
<P>
 But low-income areas produce the fewest volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's harder to find volunteers in poor communities because they can't afford 
to give up work or they are busy with survival issues," Mata said. "But 
ultimately, it's going to be the rank-and-file (church members) who live out in 
the world and have ideas about what needs to be done who can make a 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the stories of four local volunteers who are doing just that. Juana 
Esther Martinez / 'An Incredible Spirit' 
</P>
<P>
 Unemployed and struggling with cancer, Juana Esther Martinez was seeking a new 
start when she went to MacArthur Park in the fall of 1992 for what a friend 
told her would be a meeting about job opportunities. Instead, it turned out to 
be an Episcopalian service in progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I approached I saw (the Rev. Philip Lance) raising the (communion) host 
and I was touched," Martinez said recently. "I realized it was a Mass and I 
felt called" by God. 
</P>
<P>
 The outdoor service occurred during the early days of Pueblo Nuevo (New 
Community) Mission, a tiny storefront church now located at 7th and Burlington 
streets in Westlake. Martinez, a 37-year-old with waist-length black hair, 
quickly became one of the mission's top five community leaders and a key player 
in its steady growth, from zero to 38 families in two years, Lance recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "God has taught me how to walk step by step," Martinez said through a 
translator. "When you look at my background, (this work) isn't something I 
would have taken on myself." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez's youthful face belies the details of a difficult life: She left 
school when she was 8 years old to clean houses. Later, her husband deserted 
her, leaving her to raise three children. In her mid-30s, after immigrating to 
the United States in 1983, she confronted uterine cancer -- and subsequent 
chemotherapy and depression. With the cancer in remission, she now supports an 
extended family of 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Raised Catholic in a small town near Guadalajara, Martinez grew up terrified 
of priests, believing that it would be a sin for her unordained hands to open 
the Bible.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, under Lance's guidance, she teaches catechism each Saturday to 
neighborhood children and dons church robs to help Lance serve the Eucharist on 
Sundays. "She is an incredible spirit," Lance said. "She is somebody who wants 
to get something done for God. It is a wonder how somebody with so little gives 
so much." 
</P>
<P>
 After working during the day as a janitor, commuting between jobs at a 
Westside apartment building and a Westlake halfway house, she acts as Lance's 
liaison to neighborhood families. Visiting homes, she encourages residents to 
attend Mass and send their children to catechism. She has brought at least a 
dozen families into the mission as members. 
</P>
<P>
 When the mission opened a thrift shop to raise money, she volunteered hundreds 
of hours during the first four months organizing, displaying and cleaning 
merchandise in the store. When the mission created a jobs cooperative, an 
employee-owned property and landscape maintenance business, she helped Lance 
select the first contracts, and the employees elected her its first president. 
</P>
<P>
 While Martinez assisted during a recent church service, Ruth Miranda listened 
to a story from the Gospel about a poor widow who gives her last two pennies to 
the church as an offering to God. 
</P>
<P>
 "He might as well be talking about Esther," said Miranda, a board member for 
Pueblo Nuevo Development Inc., the mission's economic development arm. "Her 
greatest gift is her humility. She's totally devoted and never asks 'What do I 
get for this?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez spends nearly every free hour volunteering for the church, but says 
her contribution does not deserve recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't feel like I do anything," she said, softly, unable to meet a 
visitor's eyes. "I don't do enough compared to what I have been given." Bruce 
Friedman / 'A Great Feeling of Accomplishment' 
</P>
<P>
 In the cozy dining nook of his spacious Windsor Square home, a basket of fresh 
bagels and croissants before him, Bruce Friedman sips his second cup of coffee. 
Less than a mile away at Wilshire Boulevard Temple, scores of homeless line up 
for food pantry donations -- grocery bags of bread and dried milk. 
</P>
<P>
 This disturbing contrast inspired Friedman to approach his rabbi six years ago 
and suggest that the temple become a base for social service programs. Then 38, 
Friedman, an attorney, was settled with a family and successful in his career 
and wanted to fulfill what he considered his duty as a Jew to help the less 
fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1988, he has volunteered countless hours as president of Hopenet, a 
multidenominational coalition of mid-Wilshire congregations that, under 
Friedman's direction, set up a network of eight food pantries that serve 
100,000 meals annually. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, the group has opened Hope West, a 17-unit apartment building on 
West Street that will house low-income families in the Mid-Wilshire district. 
</P>
<P>
 "Homelessness really troubled me. The contrast between the haves and the 
have-nots was really more than I could bear," said Friedman in his 
characteristic low-key manner. "I felt very comfortable in my own life and very 
uncomfortable with the fact that we had people on the street." 
</P>
<P>
 Fellow Hopenet board members say Friedman has nudged the organization to 
accomplish more than they had ever dreamed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Food is easy to distribute but when Bruce suggested we get into permanent 
housing, we all thought 'What about financing? We don't know anything about 
development,' " recalled Michael Mata, former Hopenet vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were all volunteers and didn't have the expertise. Bruce pushed with 
perseverance to get a housing commitment." 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman coordinated a partnership with the Los Angeles Community Design 
Center, which patched together city and state funds and federal tax credits to 
finance the $3.2-million project. Friedman also convinced Hopenet board members 
there should be a social worker on staff at the building and found funding for 
the position. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Sunday, Friedman toured the apartment building for the first time. 
"This is great!" he exclaimed, throwing up his hands, as he walked through one 
of the bright units. "It's across the street from (Queen Anne) park and it's a 
great place to live." 
</P>
<P>
 Hopenet is looking for a building to rehabilitate to provide more housing. But 
Friedman's long-term goal is to make Hopenet, which is financed with Federal 
Emergency Management Agency funds and other donations, financially 
self-sufficient. One way to do that, he said, would be through a thrift shop, 
and plans to open one are on the drawing board. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, he said, volunteer projects take him away from his family too much. 
Friedman also serves on his temple's board and is a member of the economic 
development committee for the Interfaith Coalition to Heal Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when I say 'Bruce, we need to talk,' " said his wife, Linda, who also 
volunteers at the temple and her daughters' schools. Indeed, the couple 
routinely miss one another two or three nights a week because of volunteer 
duties, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friedman's Hopenet work comes second only to his family, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I've done anything in any small way to make someone's life better," he 
said, "that's a great feeling of accomplishment." Sonja Sharp / 'A Constant 
Soldier' 
</P>
<P>
 Sonja Sharp perches on her chair, motionless as one of her literacy students 
stands before his classmates to read the week's lesson. The 46-year-old 
student, one of 10 in the course, labors to read the simple assignment and 
Sharp is touched by his effort. She digs a tissue from her purse to dab away 
tears.  
</P>
<P>
 "You made me cry," she tells Michael Moore, leading the group in applause. 
"Let's give him a hand." 
</P>
<P>
 It is this kind of compassion, a sign of her dedication, that has made Sharp a 
gift to the West Angeles Literacy Empowerment Team, a program of the Jefferson 
Park-based West Angeles Church of God in Christ, said Gwen Thomas, program 
coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is a constant soldier," Thomas said. "She's energetic and almost as 
dogmatic about the cause as I am." 
</P>
<P>
 For the past year, Sharp, 47, has been assigned to teach recovering drug and 
alcohol abusers at Transition House, an all-male residential rehabilitation 
program run by the church in Compton. Through her weekly class, she promotes 
reading and writing, the word of God and self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 "No man is disabled in his ability but every man is capable in his learning," 
she preaches to the men, staring at them so hard not one can break the gaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Their quiet respect and studious manner reflect deep feelings for Sharp. Some 
call her an inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of weeks before I came in here I couldn't read anything," Moore 
said. "I could sign my name to papers but I was functionally illiterate. When I 
met her I told her I had a reading disability and she cradled me in her arms 
and told me she'd have me reading in two months." 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Sharp's dedication dates back to her childhood in Fort Worth, Tex., 
where she often spent afternoons tutoring her younger brother, who was learning 
disabled. Later, she left home to attend college in Riverside and at 17, landed 
a singing contract with Columbia Records. Sharp and her all-girl trio, the 
Deb-Tones, spent five years recording popular Motown-style music. 
</P>
<P>
 Fame may have eluded her but Sharp's faith was constant. In 1988, she quit an 
accounting job to become a full-time volunteer and evangelist for her 
Pentecostal faith.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was time to do what I was called to do," she said. For nine years she was 
the volunteer host of a Christian talk show on KTYM (1460 AM) that addressed a 
variety of topics on "how to live a holy life." Today, in addition to tutoring, 
she sometimes takes the men on field trips, evangelizes at public events, 
teaches a weekly class on how to proselytize and works with the homeless on 
Skid Row when she can. 
</P>
<P>
 The work is all part of her Christian duty, she said. "They tell me that my 
mother believed I was ordained in her womb. So I can never remember when I 
didn't go tell someone about Christ, even as a kid. The teaching is part of (my 
evangelizing). I grew up with it (evangelizing) in my heart. . . . I was born 
into it." Ellee J. White / 'The Guidance of the Lord' 
</P>
<P>
 Ellee J. White has a reputation for being a whip-cracker. When she speaks, 
people scurry. 
</P>
<P>
 Even her boss in an AIDS food pantry where she volunteers concedes it is White 
who is really in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though she's the volunteer and I'm the coordinator, (in) truth she's the 
one who coordinates me," said Adrian Luna, volunteer coordinator and interim 
director of Imani Unidos, a pantry run by Faith United Methodist Church in the 
Athens neighborhood. "Without her, I'd probably be running around with my head 
cut off." 
</P>
<P>
 In two years, the tiny pantry has built a clientele of about 150 low-income 
and HIV-positive men and women, who come for groceries free of charge once a 
week on an appointed day. White, 71, a retired auditor for the county social 
services department, has staffed the pantry each Wednesday since it opened, and 
whenever Luna needs an extra hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd never really thought about working with HIV-positive people, but I'm the 
type to go wherever there's a need," said White, who has lived in the 
neighborhood for 35 years. "The guidance of the Lord just sends me there." 
</P>
<P>
 She bustles down the two short aisles of the pantry, briskly pulling canned 
tuna, tamales and toilet paper from the shelves to fill a client's order. When 
she's filled three grocery bags, she delivers the supplies through the pantry 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 When someone mucks up the system, White gets riled. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm gonna walk right outta here," she threatened after Luna retrieved some 
extra goodies as a favor to a client. "You should not make differences between 
these people. It only causes problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes White appears inflexible and a little harsh to the clients, who are 
referred to the pantry by social service agencies and groups helping those with 
the AIDS virus. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has attitude," said one young man. "You shouldn't work with people with 
AIDS and HIV and have attitude. This is the last time I come on Wednesdays, 
just so I won't have to see her." 
</P>
<P>
 But White was unmoved. "That's not right" for one client to be given extra 
supplies, she said. "That's not fair. I won't tolerate it." 
</P>
<P>
 Pastor Andrew Robinson-Gaither says it is White's combination of vinegar and 
honey that makes her so valuable as a volunteer. "She's a no-nonsense person, 
who, once committed to a task, is unstoppable. . . . Volunteers like Ellee are 
expressing love unconditionally and that is a very hard thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 White claims she is slowing down a bit with age, but her pace is hardly 
sluggish. In addition to the pantry work, she is president of the church branch 
of United Methodist women, and coordinates fund-raisers for Prison Fellowship 
Ministries, a Christian outreach program that organizes Christmas celebrations 
for children of the incarcerated each year. 
</P>
<P>
 A tour of the church reveals evidence of her other contributions. Here, the 
tables she raised money to buy; there, the commercial coffee maker donated by a 
local restaurant at her urging. 
</P>
<P>
 After 30 years working for the county, White, who retired in 1986, now 
volunteers full time. She laughs at her so-called retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 "My neighbor tells me all the time she wishes I had a job again, because she 
saw me more when I worked." On the Cover 
</P>
<P>
 Juana Esther Martinez serves the Eucharist on a Sunday afternoon at Pueblo 
Nuevo Mission Church in Westlake. Martinez has volunteered with the small 
storefront church for two years, teaching catechism on Saturdays and helping to 
draw new members. 
</P>
<P>
 Surveys have shown almost half of all adults perform some volunteer work at 
least once a year. Volunteers give an average of 4.2 hours a week, with members 
of religious organizations more than twice as likely to do unpaid work than 
those who have no affiliation, according to a recent Gallup survey.

court at the time of the Boxer Rebellion in 1900. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen inches tall, the costumed miniatures are constructed on metal 
skeletons from a combination of papier-mache, Styrofoam and cotton padding. 
Over this a lifelike "skin" of cloth and a special blend of plastic are applied 
by the artist in layers for the most realistic effect.

BEING A WIZARD ON THE BLACKTOP MEANS NOTHING AROUND HERE; BASKETBALL: WHAT DO 
HIGH SCHOOL COACHES LOOK FOR IN A PLAYER? IT ALL BEGINS WITH A RIGOROUS 
COMBINATION OF INSTRUCTION AND DRILLS KNOWN AS TRYOUTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A teen-ager takes his place in the layup line. He anxiously awaits his turn, 
hoping that in some way his performance that day will give Crenshaw Coach 
Willie West reason to bring him back for another shot at a coveted position on 
one of the country's most successful high school basketball programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The nervous youngster is one of more than 1,000 kids in the Central City who, 
for a three-week period in October and November, go through a rigorous 
combination of drills and instruction known as tryouts. 
</P>
<P>
 After the three-hour workout, the teen-ager joins the rest of the group, which 
has formed a circle around West as if he were telling campfire stories. 
</P>
<P>
 But West's intention is not to entertain. Instead, he informs the young 
hopefuls of the standards they must meet if they expect to become members of 
the Cougars basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Dec. 8, Santa Ana Valley comes to the Cougars' Den," said West, referring 
to Crenshaw's first home game, the start of the school's drive for a third 
straight state championship and 14th City Section 4-A Division title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have lost four games in this gym," said West, who began coaching at 
Crenshaw in 1971. "That means when you step onto this floor, you should be 
ready to play hard, smart and give 110%." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Ronnie Arch knows that Crenshaw tryouts can be a crucible for 
newcomers, who are not used to the fierce competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hard and very competitive; I felt like a little kid getting pushed 
around," said the 6-6 Arch, who first tried out for the varsity as a sophomore. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just have to take one practice at a time and play hard. It's easier this 
year because I'm used to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Arch and teammate Raymond Palmer vied for a roster spot against the likes of 
Tremaine Fowlkes, Kris Johnson, Reggie McFerren and Tommie Davis -- all of whom 
received Division I scholarships last season. 
</P>
<P>
 With that kind of opposition, Palmer said, the only way to make it is to stay 
focused. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hard (for me) because there were people bigger than me," said Palmer, 
a 6-7 forward. But "I worked hard and just played my game. If you really want 
it, you can have it." 
</P>
<P>
 Getting it is up to the coaches, who must weigh several factors when 
determining whether a player fits into the team's scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most important is youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look at the younger kids because I predicate everything on the youth," 
Dorsey Coach Kevin Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will pick an 11th-grader before a 12th-grader. I try to get three or four 
10th-graders who can contribute during the season. (That way) they get 
experience and an understanding of what I want over the next two years." 
</P>
<P>
 Like Gibson, Coach Randolph Simpson of Manual Arts also puts a premium on 
youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I go to the younger kids because they will be there longer," said Simpson, 
whose Toilers have made the playoffs each of his seven years as coach. "The 
longevity factor is very important." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, every coach looks for a player with tremendous athletic ability or 
a deft shooting touch. 
</P>
<P>
 But as Roosevelt Coach Dave Perea has found out, there are other intangibles 
that make for a great player. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Roosevelt area, the smaller players are usually the better players, 
which means Perea must find athletes with qualities that compensate for a lack 
of size. 
</P>
<P>
 "To compete with athletically superior schools like Crenshaw and Manual Arts, 
I look for smart kids, scrappiness and heart," said Perea, whose Roughrider 
team lost to Banning in last year's City 3-A championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all my years at Roosevelt, the most common comment made to me (about the 
team) is that we play hard. We might get outmuscled, but not outhustled." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as important as who a coach decides to keep is who he chooses to cut. The 
process of elimination can backfire if a coach acts in haste. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first cuts are not hard to make because running, jumping, hand-eye 
coordination, playmaking and shooting are readily apparent," Perea said. "When 
you get down further, it gets harder.  
</P>
<P>
 "So much of coaching is projecting. Mario (Hernandez) came to my door the last 
week of tryouts and said he wanted to play. I discouraged him, but he came out, 
made the team and turned out to be my best player." 
</P>
<P>
 Tryouts begin with conditioning drills, perhaps the most important phase in 
terms of allowing a coach to survey a player's physical ability as well as his 
spirit and desire. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first couple of weeks, kids cut themselves through conditioning because 
they don't have the desire," Gibson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perea agrees: "Conditioning and running will make a lot of kids see it is a 
lot more physically demanding (than they expected)." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, someone has to get cut and, as West points out, the coach can 
be unfairly viewed as the bad guy. 
</P>
<P>
 "In essence, players cut players," West said. "If a coach sees a player that's 
better than another player, then the better player cuts the other player. But 
the coach is the bad guy for putting up the list." 
</P>
<P>
 West adds: "A lot of people have told (the kids) they should go out for the 
team because of what they can do on the blacktop. But some kids don't like 
organized ball. Some have a problem learning plays. Some lack the discipline. 
Some are eliminated because they can't catch on or are frustrated. A lot of it 
is just what they can't do." 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, there are grades. 
</P>
<P>
 "The big factor for me is grades if the kid is a senior," Simpson said. "If 
you get a dynamite player that never goes to class, he can't help you or 
himself." 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd that once filled the Crenshaw gym now disperses to the exits. West 
does not carry around a pen and pad, but in his mind he has already noted out 
the names of several players who won't be back tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he knows he has given them a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I let anybody and everybody come out," West said. "I encourage everyone. I 
get players who I know are not obviously going to make it, but I give them the 
opportunity. Many players come out with no intention of making the team but 
somewhere in life they can say, 'I went out for the Crenshaw basketball team.'

FILM CLIPS: THE HANKS BOYS; HEY, EVEN BIG BROTHER WASN'T ALWAYS BIG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 From Jim Hanks' perspective on his acting career, there is both good news and 
bad news in his bloodlines. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news: Jim Hanks is Tom Hanks' younger brother. The bad news: Jim 
Hanks is Tom Hanks' younger brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people are really great about it, some aren't," says Hanks, 33, as yet 
another waiter pops by to see if everything is all right. "I auditioned for 
something recently and heard back later the casting director could not get over 
the fact that I looked so much like Tom that she didn't even hear me. She did 
not hear my audition." 
</P>
<P>
 T.L. Lankford, screenwriter, novelist and now director, is one who was not 
distracted by Hanks' amazing similarity to his brother, and cast him in "Dark 
Red," a low-budget thriller due early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first I wanted to cast him as one of the leads, a character who has 
suffered brain damage," Lankford says. "But when he read it, I realized it was 
far too close to 'Forrest Gump' and neither one of us wanted to exploit Tom's 
name or that character." (Incidentally, Jim doubled for Tom in several of that 
film's jogging scenes.) 
</P>
<P>
 The director, who loved Hanks' reading but not the irony, felt awkward asking 
him to play a cop -- a much smaller part than that of the brain-damaged 
character -- but Hanks had no qualms about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, a job's a job," Hanks says. And the jobs, while not exactly 
the next "Forrest Gump," "Sleepless in Seattle" or "Philadelphia," are coming: 
National voice-over spots for Hyundai and Jack in the Box have already aired; a 
part in a small film he recently completed called "Night Skies" in which he was 
blown to smithereens, and other nibbles, including the lead in a feature called 
"Body Language," which will shoot once financing is nailed down. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanks wouldn't even be in Southern California if it weren't for his actress 
wife, Karen. They had been living a quiet life in Sacramento since the late 
'80s, until Karen Hanks decided to have a go at making it in Hollywood as an 
actress. Soon after relocating, she landed a receptionist job for an agent, who 
coaxed Karen's husband, who had been waiting tables in the state capital, into 
the business. 
</P>
<P>
 The first auditions were horrific, he says, because he simply wasn't prepared. 
Several acting classes later, Hanks soon landed the lead role in . . . 
"Buford's Beach Bunnies," a straight-to-video sex romp that came out in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "The casting director said you should go in and not tell them your real name," 
recalls Hanks of the audition for that film. "So he took my headshot and cut my 
name off and I used my middle name. I went in as Jim Mathews." The audition 
went well, Hanks landed the role and the filmmakers laughed when learned of 
their star's famous lineage. 
</P>
<P>
 The temptation to exploit his relationship and resemblance to his brother, 
however, constantly looms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was approached about doing a television remake of 'Splash,' " he says. Then 
came tales of torment when some studio wanted to do a series inspired by Tom's 
first blockbuster, "Big." 
</P>
<P>
 "I was contacted five different times," says Hanks, a little irritated at the 
memory. "Then one time somebody from one of the studios called me at home on 
Saturday morning pleading me to come in and read it. I said no." 
</P>
<P>
 When he told Tom about it, his big brother concurred. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'You're right. You're absolutely right,' " Jim says Tom told him. " 'It 
would be the most stupid thing you could possibly do.' "

FILM CLIPS: SYMPATHY FOR THE DEVILISH; WHAT'S A LITTLE MOTHERLY MURDER BETWEEN 
FRIENDS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Emanuel Levy

<P>
 Peter Jackson, the 33-year-old New Zealand director, has been mostly known to 
the film festival circuits for his offbeat sci-fi and horror movies ("Bad 
Taste," "Dead Alive"), which went on to achieve international cult status. 
</P>
<P>
 That reputation may change, however, with the release of his new film, 
"Heavenly Creatures," a powerful dramatization of the 1954 Parker-Hulme case, 
in which two New Zealand teen-age girls murdered the mother of one of them. The 
film, which opened Wednesday, has already won the prestigious Venice Film 
Festival Silver Lion and Toronto Film Festival Metro Media Award. 
</P>
<P>
 The high-profile case, still called "New Zealand's most famous crime," has 
continued to fascinate the media -- and public -- for 40 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "But in all this time," Jackson says in a recent visit to Los Angeles, "the 
story has never been told sympathetically." During the trial of Pauline Parker, 
15, and Juliet Hulme, 16 (played in the film by first-time teen-age actresses 
Melanie Lynskey and Kate Winslet, respectively) for the murder of Parker's 
mother, tabloids wrote mostly titillating accounts of the crime itself and of 
the peculiar, possibly lesbian, friendship between the girls. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson's longtime collaborator Frances Walsh was the first to suggest he 
tackle the subject on film. "I immediately fell in love with this unusual 
tale," Jackson says. "I became obsessed with it." 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, Jackson decided to focus on the extraordinary friendship 
between the girls rather than the end result, a gory murder that sent them to 
prison. "Our intention was to make a film about an intense relationship," 
Jackson says, "that went terribly wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson and Walsh began reading newspaper accounts of the trial, but they 
quickly realized the lurid articles contained little useful information. "In 
the 1950s, Pauline and Juliet were branded as the 'most evil people,' " Jackson 
says. "What they had done seemed without rational explanation -- people assumed 
there was something wrong with their minds. 
</P>
<P>
 "The press labeled them the 'lesbian schoolgirl killers.' Criminal psychology 
was at its most primitive. The public believed it was a case of insanity, of 
homosexuality, mental illnesses you could recover from, with the right 
treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 To achieve a more compassionate perspective, they undertook a massive search 
for people who knew the girls. Their main sources were the court records and 
Parker's diaries, in which she recorded thoughts about her intense friendship 
with Hulme. Based on these diaries, the girls emerged as two extremely 
intelligent and imaginative adolescents with a wicked, irreverent humor. The 
entire voice-over in the film is based on Parker's writings. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson sees the film as non-judgmental: "These two girls were innocent 
outcasts before they met, who became even more outcast once they forged a 
friendship. They evolved their own secret code, their own fantasy utopian 
milieu, an Arthurian kingdom." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the lesbian overtones, Jackson feels it was "natural for girls of that 
age to take baths and sleep together," citing Parker's diaries, in which she 
wrote, "we tried to enact the way saints would make love." 
</P>
<P>
 Up to the murder, Jackson's film embraces the girls' point of view "because we 
wanted the audience not just to observe but to participate." In the last 
segment, however, the camera backs off and the film becomes more detached and 
stylized. "I can understand everything but their motivation for the murder, 
everything until the leap they made from the fantasy of killing to its 
reality." 
</P>
<P>
 Both women were convicted and spent five years in separate prisons. "They were 
pardoned," says Jackson, "as it was clear to the authorities they wouldn't 
offend again." Their release, however, was contingent on their never seeing 
each other again. They never did. 
</P>
<P>
 About three years ago, when a sensationalistic play, "Daughters of Heaven," 
was produced in New Zealand, a reporter familiar with the case wrote a story 
for the Wellington Sunday News, describing Hulme's whereabouts. Hulme -- who 
had been living quietly in the Scottish Highlands as successful British mystery 
writer Anne Perry -- finally broke her anonymity and gave an interview in the 
London Daily Telegraph, in which she talked about the murder for the first 
time.  
</P>
<P>
 Pauline Parker was kept on parole until 1965, when she left New Zealand after 
earning a degree in English. Her location and current identity remain unknown. 
Jackson never tried to contact the women: "We respect their privacy; we didn't 
want to invade it." 
</P>
<P>
 Film offers have been pouring in, but Jackson says that he has no desire to go 
Hollywood. Yet his next picture, "The Frighteners," a comic ghost thriller 
starring Michael J. Fox, will be for Universal and produced by Robert Zemeckis. 
Jackson is holding out on at least one issue, however: It is being shot in New 
Zealand.

FILM CLIPS: CINEWOMEN; SCHMOOZE, NETWORK, SHOWCASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Anne Bergman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About six months ago, two women working in the film industry found themselves 
musing over cocktails at the Dresden Room in Los Angeles, wondering why it was 
that so many of their peers were excluded from the Hollywood Boys Club. When, 
they asked each other, would female filmmakers finally get the break they 
deserved? What had happened to the Year of the Woman, anyway? 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than wallowing in the injustice of it all, Elizabeth Cunningham, 31, 
and Jennifer Johnson, 25, decided to take action in their own lives. The 
result? A regular film series devoted to showcasing new films by women, the 
Cinewomen Screening Series, which begins Wednesday at the American Film 
Institute 
</P>
<P>
 Armed with the notion that, as Cunningham puts it, "there are a lot of 
talented women out there, they're just under-represented," the duo had no 
trouble persuading Cinewomen, a nonprofit 400- member organization dedicated to 
the advancement of women in the entertainment industry, to donate its support. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're advocates of women helping each other," says Elisa Rothstein, one of 
Cinewomen's founders and its current president, on why the group lent its name 
and resources to the program. "This series gives us a broader arena in which to 
be supportive." 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of Cinewomen and sponsor Panavision, Cunningham and Johnson next 
set out to gather films, eventually screening more than 50. They wound up with 
five films, a mix of animated and live-action, documentary and narrative work, 
all directed, written and produced by women. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one film is by an established filmmaker, Tamra Davis ("Gun Crazy," 
"CB4"), while most are by those who have toiled in obscurity. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Udelson, whose 20-minute comedy "The Party Favor" made the cut, says that 
it's enough just to have her film screened. Udelson's film, which she describes 
as a "non-traditional subject handled in a traditional way," tells the story of 
a lesbian couple who find themselves at a hyper-suburban bridal shower. 
</P>
<P>
 "My film was being ignored at the bigger film festivals," she says, "so I'm 
happy to have more people see it. It's no different than being a painter who 
wants an exhibition for their work." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, currently in post-production on "Billy Madison" for Universal, may not 
need the exposure for her independently made documentary video "No Alternative 
Girls," which recently aired on MTV. Yet she sees the series as offering her a 
chance to feel a part of a filmmaking community. "I really don't know that many 
people in the film industry," she confesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Udelson, a former editor in TriStar's advertising department, says, "I'm not 
schmoozy, I'm not hooked in, I don't hang around with other filmmakers. This 
gives me a pool of filmmakers to commiserate with." 
</P>
<P>
 But both Cunningham and Johnson stress that they're not out to create a 
Hollywood Girls Club. "We want Boys Clubs and Girls Clubs to become extinct," 
Johnson says. "This is about bringing the industry to see the work of 
struggling independent filmmakers." 
</P>
<P>
 The two say they plan to offer a series three times a year.  
</P>
<P>
 "We wish this wasn't necessary," Johnson adds, "but we have a sense of humor 
about the fact that it is." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Cinewomen Screening Series begins Wednesday at 7:30 p.m. at the American 
Film Institute, at the Mark Goodson Theatre, 2021 N. Western Ave., Los Angeles, 
(213) 856-7600. Reservations: (310) 855-8720. Tickets are $5 and can be 
purchased at the door. For information on submissions for future programs, 
write to Cinewomen, 9903 Santa Monica Blvd., Suite 461, Beverly Hills 90212.

BEYOND HEAVY METAL AND POWER RANGERS; THE ACCLAIMED LOS ANGELES CHILDREN'S 
CHORUS IS NOT KIDS' PLAY. ITS MEMBERS KNOW HOW TO 'MAKE MUSIC IN A BEAUTIFUL, 
SPONTANEOUS WAY.'

 What Los Angeles choral group is in demand by major orchestras and opera 
companies, was chosen to represent the United States at a Central European 
choir festival in 1992 and took first place at this summer's national choir 
competition at Princeton University? 
</P>
<P>
 Surprise. Praised for its professionalism, at home with a varied repertory 
that includes Renaissance, Baroque, Classical, Romantic and contemporary 
secular and liturgical works, the Los Angeles Children's Chorus has gained a 
national reputation for excellence. 
</P>
<P>
 And, its members aren't even old enough to drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The group, described by L.A. Philharmonic conductor Esa-Pekka Salonen through 
a spokeswoman as "one of the best children's choruses" he has ever worked with, 
is made up of about 160 young people, ages 8 to 16. Based at Pasadena 
Presbyterian Church, these junior vocalists give the lie to media images of 
shallow, minimally focused youth sparked to life solely by MTV, adult-trashing 
"Home Alone" high jinks or "Mighty Morphin Power Rangers." 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Daniel Sanez, 13, in the company's Concert Choir, the advanced performing 
group, about his favorite music and he responds: "I like Chopin and Beethoven 
and I'm very amazed by Bach, his ways of fugue and counterpoint, stuff like 
that -- he must have been a mathematician." 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Intermediate Choir member Quinton Hershiser, 9, son of L.A. Dodgers 
pitcher Orel Hershiser, why he is starting his second year with the group, and 
he enthuses: "My mom is a really talented singer so I inherited that from her, 
I love to sing everywhere, I play the organ all the time and I listen to 
classical music all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 (And, yes, he plays baseball. "There's only one broken window so far," he says 
with a grin.) 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon Mack, 13, a four-year veteran and a Concert Choir member (his father 
is Music Center Opera's Jonathan Mack), likes "really, really modern stuff, 
plus baroque and chant and motets. I'm not into romantic with the major 
exception of Strauss. I love Strauss." 
</P>
<P>
 Alto Megan Quinn, 12, points out, however, that they are not so different from 
their less classically minded peers. Her favorite rock group is Counting Crows. 
"My friends at school always talk about new bands and concerts." She giggles. 
"It's never like, oh, guess what, they're playing Mozart." 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel agrees. "I'm open to everything, except for -- " 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon, Megan and colleague Sherry Wasef, 12, finish in unison: "heavy metal, 
rap and country." 
</P>
<P>
 Chorus members, boys and girls from the Greater Los Angeles area, are chosen 
through audition. Depending upon their experience and motivation, they can 
progress through apprentice and intermediate levels to the professionally 
performing Concert Choir. Although all come in with some musical background, 
entry-level experience varies. 
</P>
<P>
 "They may be in a school choir and their teacher has recommended them," said 
Intermediate Director Stephanie Naifeh. "We also have a core of children who 
come from our church programs, and then there's word-of-mouth. You get some 
with some choral training and some with none." 
</P>
<P>
 A year's tuition, adjusted annually, is currently $350-$450; scholarships are 
available to those in need. The church, strongly supportive of the group, 
provides working facilities and performance space for a nominal fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding proper texts, teaching singing, diction, tone, new words in many 
languages and how the orchestra, concertmaster and conductor work are only part 
of the challenges involved in teaching these young choristers. There are basics 
that adult choirs don't have to practice: how to stand and sit still for long 
periods of time and how to unobtrusively leave the stage. No fidgeting is 
allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff -- Naifeh; Rebecca Thompson, who is the company's founder, Concert 
Choir director and guiding force; Anne Chesher Tomlinson, director of the 
Apprentice Choir and accompanist for the Intermediate Choir; Stephanie 
Hutchinson, pianist, composer and Concert Choir accompanist, and Paul Floyd, 
Apprentice Choir accompanist -- has extensive backgrounds in performance and 
music education. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really do an admirable job of maintaining a high artistic level," said 
Robin Thompson, artistic administrator for the L.A. Opera, "in the face of all 
the things that are working against that: dwindling government support, the 
lack of music education in the schools. They have an uphill battle." 
</P>
<P>
 "The sham of education . . . is to think that children can't do this," said 
Rebecca Thompson. "If we have adequately trained teachers and enough support, 
all children can respond to this. For them to have less is a shame." 
</P>
<P>
 James Litton, music director of the American Boychoir in Princeton, N.J., and 
one of the principal judges who awarded the Concert Choir first place in this 
summer's Princeton Invitational Choir Festival, concurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think many music educators are realizing that children are capable of doing 
a lot more than has been expected, not only in music and the arts but in many 
other areas. Music opens up all sorts of mental approaches to excelling." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The L.A. choir's "outstanding characteristic," in addition to fulfilling 
technical requirements of execution, tone and interpretation, Litton said, is 
its ability to "make music in a beautiful, spontaneous way. So many children's 
choirs . . . are technically perfect, but you get the feeling they are drilled. 
Rebecca has instilled in (her singers) a sense of being musicians and making 
the music come alive." 
</P>
<P>
 John Alexander, artistic director of both the Orange County-based Pacific 
Chorale and Angeles Chorale, has used the Los Angeles group for several years. 
It is "the standard bearer for excellence in children's music in the whole 
Southern California area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Concert Choir's most recent public performances include Mahler's Third 
Symphony under Salonen this year, and two presentations of Carl Orff's lusty 
oratorio, "Carmina Burana," one on the Los Angeles Master Chorale series, the 
other during this summer's Hollywood Bowl season. 
</P>
<P>
 "They hold their own," said Paul Salamunovich, director of the L.A. Master 
Chorale. "They come on extremely prepared and very disciplined. Their behavior, 
their training, their musicality is always there. There's never a slip-up. You 
have children acting like professionals and singing like professionals. They're 
always in control." 
</P>
<P>
 Where that control comes from is evident in rehearsals. Each director has her 
own style with each level, but all communicate an intense commitment to 
excellence. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent Concert Choir rehearsal, Thompson quietly stopped the singers. 
"You're giving me a more immature children's sound than I want," she explained. 
They worked on vowels for a few minutes. Suddenly, what had been a somewhat 
muddied sound rang out with astonishing purity. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearing the striking difference, the children, standing on risers in T-shirt 
and jeans, were clearly delighted. Thompson smiled. "That's worth my whole year 
to hear," she told them. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching the choristers in concert, an observer is struck by how many are 
plainly transported by the music they are making. Thompson isn't surprised. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I have an idealistic bent that makes me think that all humankind has 
an affinity for beauty. I think children know when something is lovely. It's 
just an intrinsic something that draws them." The directors strive at "every 
rehearsal" to give the children "something that is an example of this beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to have an 'ah, ha!' moment. If you've got 45 minutes of rehearsal 
and you're working notes, at some point they have to see all that hard work pay 
off in (at least) three gorgeous notes. Then they'll want to come back." 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon Mack puts it slightly differently: "You're in rehearsal and you're, 
like, why am I here, because you're singing the same little chunk of music 
forever and getting sick of it. But then -- and I know this sounds cheesy, and 
like, oh, right -- I've sung a part of music that gets to me and chills run up 
and down my body and I'm like, whoa, that was cool."*

SCHOOL STANDS OUT FOR BETTER, FOR WORSE; EDUCATION: FULLERTON'S SUNNY HILLS 
HIGH IS FULL OF ACHIEVERS, BUT A FEW OF ITS GRADS HAVE MADE GRISLY HEADLINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Sunny Hills High is a public school with a zero percent dropout rate and no 
graffiti on the walls, a place where students brag about pulling all-nighters 
and compete in honors classes for the highest A-plus. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson Browne went there. So did All-Star major league catcher Gary Carter. 
Its reputation stretches across the Pacific Ocean, luring Korean immigrants in 
search of the best in American education, and to the elite Eastern colleges 
where graduates flock. 
</P>
<P>
 But lately the sparkling test scores at the suburban campus have been 
overshadowed by a string of grisly headlines: A would-be valedictorian of the 
Class of 1993 convicted in the brutal slaying of an honor student. A 1990 grad 
accused this month of murdering his parents and brother. The 1988 Teacher of 
the Year charged with killing her lover, and another longtime teacher pleading 
guilty to molesting students. 
</P>
<P>
 The former postal worker who terrorized the county with a spring, 1993, 
shooting rampage is a Sunny Hills alum too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our school's awesome," said junior Susu Irie, laughing as he stood in the 
school courtyard one afternoon. "We have everything from murderers to geniuses 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that's diversity," chimed in senior Jason Fairchild. 
</P>
<P>
 At Sunny Hills -- where scores of students sit with books open, pencils poised 
and calculators running during lunch -- the peer pressure is not to do drugs or 
join gangs. It's to earn straight A's, rack up extracurriculars and break 1350 
on the Scholastic Aptitude Test in the never-ending struggle to get into the 
best colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Three-quarters of the graduates go straight to four-year universities. Of 399 
seniors last year, 54 finished with a grade point average above 4.0; there were 
six valedictorians because that's how many students finished four years with 
nothing but A's in this school that is part of the Fullerton Union High School 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times, popularity is based on looks and stuff. Here, it's how much 
you're involved and your academics," said sophomore Brian Kim. "When everybody 
is overachieving and going for it, it kind of brings other people along. It's 
like a race -- if everyone's going fast, you go fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Esther Yoon added: "If I could sum up Sunny Hills in one word, it's 
'hyper-competitive.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But students, parents and faculty say the competition is positive, pushing 
kids to their fullest potential. Fueling the emphasis on academics is the 
growing number of Asian families devoted to top-notch education who seek out 
the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1959, Sunny Hills was for decades a predominantly white school 
nestled in a neighborhood of upper-middle class, college-educated 
professionals. Now many of the homes, which range in price from $300,000 to $1 
million, are bought mostly by Asian families attracted by the high school's 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 Koo Oh, a Fullerton dentist who heads the Korean American Assn. of Orange 
County, said many Koreans consider Sunny Hills "the best high school in 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 Some families even remain in Asia but send their children to live in Fullerton 
and attend Sunny Hills. Others from throughout Southern California borrow 
addresses from people who live in the school's attendance area to make their 
children eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, the student body was 71.8% white and 17.9% Asian. Now it is 48.4% 
Asian and 39.4% white. Four years ago, there were no "limited English 
proficiency" students -- now there are 163. The shift will likely continue: 
Asians are 45% of the Class of 1995, 51% of the Class of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a mini-United Nations up here," said assistant principal Diane 
Hockersmith. "But when you get that many different ethnicities in a place, it 
takes a little to keep everybody happy and calmed down." 
</P>
<P>
 Many students said they have individual friends of varied races, but that 
cliques form along color lines. At break, lunch and after school, Koreans 
dominate the center of the quad, whites mingle on the fringes of the leafy 
courtyard and Latinos -- 8.5% of the student body -- gather elsewhere on 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Koreans and whites park in different rows in the student lots. There is a 
Korean Family Support Group separate from the white-dominated 
Parent-Teacher-Student Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 In a school newspaper column last year, editor Jhoanna Infante complained that 
even at International Day, an event lauded for promoting cultural awareness, 
booths were segregated by race and adult volunteers gave free food to students 
of the same ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Asians don't like the whites because they're all sports and the whites 
don't like the Asians because they're all academics and money," said senior 
Brian Ashton, who has a reputation on campus for mixing easily among Asian and 
white cliques. 
</P>
<P>
 There also are divisions among Koreans, who make up 27% of the students and 
57% of the Asians. 
</P>
<P>
 Acculturated Korean-Americans tease "FOBs" -- students who are "fresh off the 
boat" -- and disdain the "gangsters" -- Koreans who wear baggy pants, carry 
beepers and boast about their connections to crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Within Koreans, there's discrimination too," said sophomore Stephen Sohn, who 
was born in the United States a few years after his parents came here from 
Korea. "If you don't know your language, they make fun of you. Some people 
speak Korean to each other when they don't want other people to understand." 
</P>
<P>
 The changing demographics have coincided with Sunny Hills' growing reputation 
for achievement. Long known within Orange County as an academic powerhouse, the 
school now stacks up among the best in the state and nation, according to test 
scores. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's senior class includes a student who earned a perfect score on the 
American College Achievement Test -- the first in the school's history. Last 
year, there was a perfect SAT score -- also a Sunny Hills first. 
</P>
<P>
 And there currently are 27 National Merit Scholarship semi-finalists on 
campus, the most ever and third in California behind only the elite private 
Harvard-Westlake school and Peninsula High School in Palos Verdes. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students and staff acknowledged that skyrocketing standards of parents 
drive the achievement culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was in high school my parents didn't even know what the SAT was," said 
English teacher Kimberley Stein, the school newspaper adviser. "There are 
Korean parents here who don't even speak English but know the cutoff (SAT score 
needed) to get into Stanford." 
</P>
<P>
 Sohn said his parents expect perfection. "Anything below an A is failure. I 
hate that, so I try to avoid that by getting the best grades I can." 
</P>
<P>
 Faculty and administrators attribute much of the achievement to the school's 
International Baccalaureate program, a rigorous set of advanced classes that 
provide a global, interdisciplinary education. More than a quarter of Sunny 
Hills students take IB classes, and there are 55 candidates this year for a 
special IB diploma, ranking the school's IB program third in the United States 
(out of 150 schools). 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 students each year apply from outside the Fullerton district to 
attend Sunny Hills, most attracted by the IB program. 
</P>
<P>
 The level below honors, "college prep," is viewed as average on campus, though 
the curriculum is more advanced than that of many public high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Students involved in IB often are overloaded with extracurricular activities. 
Both school counselors said their biggest struggle during registration each 
semester is talking campus leaders out of taking too many honors classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular students on campus also are the ones with the overstuffed 
schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since you go to Sunny Hills, you have to get good grades, you have to be 
involved," sophomore Brianne Gates said as she sat in the courtyard in her 
black-and-gold cheerleader's uniform. "You have to be the perfect student." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Shilpa Gupta said classmates "look the other way" when they hear she is 
not in honors math. Jimmy McGuire, a senior, recounted a friend saying, "Oh, 
I'd thought you were smart" upon learning that McGuire had 13 Bs over six 
semesters. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have a 4.0 and they feel inferior," McGuire quipped. "I have a 4.3, 
and it's like, 'What am I doing wrong?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The campus atmosphere is more like a prep school or private college than a 
public high school. Honors students try to one-up each other on how much work 
they have or how little sleep they've gotten and brag about addictions to No 
Doz and Vivarin. 
</P>
<P>
 Guidance counselors Cynthia Martini and Don Joynt said they spend 80% to 90% 
of their time working with students on college admissions and even assemble 
applications to private colleges for the students (last year they did 500 
applications for 200 students). 
</P>
<P>
 Each summer, history teacher Patrick Lampman takes 30 youngsters on a tour of 
Ivy League and other East Coast schools. Many students take expensive classes 
or have private tutors to prepare them for the SAT, and some hire outside 
college consultants. 
</P>
<P>
 It works: Last year, eight were accepted to Ivy League schools, eight more to 
Stanford. Seventy-eight got into UC Irvine, 65 into UCLA and 48 into UC 
Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are planning for college from their freshman year," McGuire said. 
"They're working on their perfect transcript." 
</P>
<P>
 "No," jumped in senior Jane Kim, "They start earlier than that." 
</P>
<P>
 But some complain that too much attention is paid to the top achievers, 
leaving mid-level students behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Hiromi Hiraoka said her college prep English class was once told there 
was no money for a field trip bus because it was reserved for IB classes. 
Others said it is difficult for students who are not applying to the most 
competitive colleges to get an appointment with a guidance counselor. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's average at Sunny Hills is kind of scary," said Martini, the counselor. 
"If I had a child here, that would be a concern for me, because what's average 
here is not average anywhere else." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, teachers and administrators said the academic focus and extremely high 
motivation of the students makes Sunny Hills an ideal place to work. 
</P>
<P>
 For Lampman, who came to the school in 1988 after 15 years of teaching 
elsewhere, "it's been an intellectual Renaissance." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the much acclaimed IB program, Sunny Hills is the only high 
school in California to offer five levels of Korean. Starting this spring, it 
will become the first high school in the state to offer a double-immersion 
bilingual program in Korean and English. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunny Hills also takes an innovative approach with its limited-English 
speaking students, hurrying them into college-preparatory classes rather than 
giving them lower-level academics. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, Sunny Hills is one of only nine high schools in Orange County 
with an agriculture program, where students raise chickens, turkeys, pigs, 
sheep and steers on a seven-acre farm and study agribusiness, floriculture and 
veterinary science. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers at all levels said they have more time for instruction because 
discipline is a virtual non-issue at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Students rarely skip class, giving Sunny Hills an average daily attendance 
rate of 99.6%. (Those who miss a day can make it up at Saturday school.) 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, there were only three students found to have drugs on campus, and 
two caught with knives (one was fake). Hockersmith, the assistant principal, 
said she sees about one fight each month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it was different when I came for my interview and saw all these 
roses," French teacher Lynn Johnson said of the flourishing red, pink, white 
and yellow flowers that decorate the immaculate campus. "The school I was at 
before, the kids would not have allowed a rose to bloom -- they would have 
stampeded anything living." 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge teachers at Sunny Hills face is staying ahead of students who 
read books in advance and do homework on time, often turning in projects more 
elaborate than what was assigned. 
</P>
<P>
 "They look way beyond what's due on Monday," said Gwen Almeida, who teaches 
both honors and college prep English. "It's not just, 'What am I going to get 
on this assignment?' They have a plan that's beyond high school." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its increasing success, the past few years have been rough for Sunny 
Hills, with the rash of criminal incidents connected to the campus causing 
alarm. Long derided as "Snobby Hills" because of its affluent student body, the 
school has recently earned a second taunting nickname from cross-town rivals: 
"Scummy Thrills." 
</P>
<P>
 At least two students have attempted suicide this fall, overdosing on pills, 
administrators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some wonder whether the competitive atmosphere compounded other problems in 
leading to the string of arrests in recent years. But many students, staff and 
parents insist the problems are pure coincidence and unrelated to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no connection between the school and these crazy incidents," said 
George Giokaris, Sunny Hills principal from 1989 to 1993. "There would have 
been no way to have ever predicted that these kinds of things would happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, senior Sommer Jensen said she is embarrassed to tell people where she 
goes to school because they think it's "Murder Inc." 
</P>
<P>
 "People in my class are just waiting for something bad to happen this year," 
senior Grace Fujimoto said quietly. "Because in the Class of 1995, something 
bad has happened every year." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the grisly headlines began in January, 1993, with the arrest of five 
students for the well-rehearsed slaying of a Foothill High honors student, 
there has been a complete administrative turnover at the school, bringing 
Loring Davies into the principal's chair. 
</P>
<P>
 A balding, bearded man who looks older than his 34 years, Davies keeps his 
office door open and spends hours each day roaming the campus, walkie-talkie in 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "The students here have an incredible amount of self-confidence," Davies said. 
"To take these students (who) are already bright and have excelled beyond their 
years and help them continue to grow can be very difficult. . . . Some people 
say, 'Gosh, you're putting too much pressure on students.' I don't know that 
you can have it both ways all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Massy Tadjedin is not exactly a typical Sunny Hills student -- she's more like 
the ideal. 
</P>
<P>
 Massy, president of the student body, is in class from 6:45 a.m. to 3:30 p.m. 
every day. She volunteers at the Red Cross, works at Laura Ashley on Sunday 
afternoons, and was on the homecoming court. She got 1450 on her SAT and 
applied early to Harvard. 
</P>
<P>
 Just shy of 18, Massy said she gets only a couple of hours of sleep a night 
(her mother said it's more like four) and is addicted to caffeine -- "coffee, 
Coke, chocolate, anything." She doesn't watch TV. She doesn't have time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never felt like I was in high school. I felt like I went straight from 
junior high to college," Massy said as she lugged her loaded backpack, a thick 
biology text in hand for constant cramming. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a time when I was questioning whether I was enjoying my youth," she 
reflected. "That's a huge fear I have. Am I going to look back on this and say 
I didn't have any fun in high school?" Decade of Change 
</P>
<P>
 The ethnicity of the Sunny Hills High School student body has undergone a 
massive shift during the past decade. Many Korean immigrants have moved to the 
affluent Fullerton neighborhood where the school is located, largely because 
its excellent academic reputation extends across the Pacific. A profile of 
Sunny Hills:

BIG QUESTIONS LOOM AS ANAHEIM SHAPES FUTURE; DEVELOPMENT: WILL THE RAMS STAY? 
WILL DISNEYLAND EXPAND? ANSWERS WILL AFFECT CITY FOR GENERATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The time has come for dreams to become decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Disneyland, the Convention Center and Anaheim Stadium transformed the 
city's image a generation ago, Anaheim's destiny may forever be shaped over the 
next few months by an assortment of crucial decisions and fanciful projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the Walt Disney Co. build its massive resort? Will the Rams skip town? 
And the more important question: How can the city maintain its coveted 
reputation as a tourism and professional sports mecca? 
</P>
<P>
 "This is definitely a key time for the city," Assistant City Manager Dave 
Morgan said. "These type of decisions probably only come around every 30 years 
or so and can change the direction of a city for generations." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever Disney and the Rams decide, it's clear the city won't be passive 
about its future. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are seriously studying whether to build a lavish sports complex 
that would convert the Big A to a football-only stadium, provide a new ballpark 
for the Angels, add restaurants, stores and a virtual reality entertainment 
center and connect them around a park-like setting of canals and landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials aren't wholly sure how they would make the ideas work, or if they're 
even feasible. But to Anaheim's dreamers, the plans are anything but 
far-fetched. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything we accomplished in the past could have been looked at as pie in 
the sky, and look at what's happened," said Irv Pickler, who just departed as 
councilman. "Anaheim hasn't scratched the surface yet. . . . The sky is the 
limit in Anaheim. There are so many things we can do in this city." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you're going to see some dramatic changes in Anaheim in the next 60 
to 90 days," said Bob D. Simpson, whose term as councilman also ended this 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other options the city is considering: 
</P>
<P>
 * Handing over the management and operations of its 27-year-old Convention 
Center to a private operator and giving the dome-shaped landmark a massive 
renovation and enlargement before the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 * Creating a sports authority to oversee The Pond and the two stadiums. 
Through such an authority, the city could encourage the participation of county 
government both managerially and financially. County funding and other 
additional sources of public or private financing could prove crucial to the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 * Linking the Disneyland area to the proposed sports complex by a light-rail 
or monorail system. 
</P>
<P>
 The city already has set into motion a $172-million urban face lift of the 
area surrounding Disneyland, which will include lush landscaping, wider 
streets, underground utility lines and uniform signage. With that project 
underway, city officials say they are now focusing on the property around 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal, they say, is to convert that area from primarily an office building 
complex to a thriving sports and entertainment playground that will be directly 
linked to Disneyland and the city's profitable Convention Center market. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the entertainment venues, officials say, might be a trendy "virtual 
reality" center stocked with newfangled computer simulation games. City 
officials emphasize that their plans are extremely preliminary and conceptual. 
More important, city planners have not figured out how to pay for such daunting 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 But investment from the private sector, especially Disney, would seem to be 
key to the city's success. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials hope that Disney officials will not only move forward on the 
$3-billion Disneyland expansion, but also will see the potential financial 
opportunities that could be opened up to them if they became partners with the 
city in the sports complex concept. 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Disney Chairman Michael D. Eisner said he expects to make a decision 
"very soon" on whether to go ahead with the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 But some are growing frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Elfend, a City Hall lobbyist who represents hotel developers in the 
Disneyland area, said "there is a growing sense in the community that something 
has to happen, thumbs up or thumbs down" on the Disney project. Hotel 
developers are waiting with plans to expand if Disney does, but are tired of 
waiting -- upward of two years now -- for the company to make a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials certainly haven't given up on Disney, or on its connection to 
the stadium area. 
</P>
<P>
 In high-level strategy meetings, city officials envision an Anaheim where 
tourists check into local hotels for days, visit Disneyland and the proposed 
Westcot theme parks, attend a Mighty Ducks hockey game one night and Rams 
football game the next, while filling time in between by shopping in local 
stores and dining in local restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an exciting idea," said Jeff Farano, president of the Anaheim Chamber of 
Commerce. "You have a big piece of property and the only thing on it is a 
stadium. They've got to do something to create extra business." 
</P>
<P>
 Such a scenario may not be all that far-fetched for Disney, which currently 
has Disneyland and the Mighty Ducks to anchor the ends of the ambitious 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials say that the Ducks have exceeded expectations, both 
financially and in their performance on the ice, and that the company is 
interested in pursuing new team sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Eyebrows and hopes were raised recently around City Hall when Eisner was 
spotted at a Los Angeles Clippers game with team owner Donald Sterling. Disney 
officials dismissed speculation that they were interested in buying the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have high expectations and high requirements regarding our investments," 
said Mighty Ducks President Tony Tavares. "Everything has to be in proper order 
for us. The planets have to be in proper position." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney officials also say they haven't closed the door on participating in 
sports complex development, which could also include hotels and a restaurant 
row. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never rule anything out," said Kenneth P. Wong, senior vice president of 
Disney's development division. He said he is constantly amazed by the Anaheim's 
progressive spirit. "It's the hub of family entertainment in Southern 
California. . . . Can you think of another city like it? I can't." 
</P>
<P>
 If Disney doesn't get involved in the sports complex, some city officials say 
privately that the opportunities could then be offered to a Disney competitor, 
such as a Universal Studios or MGM. 
</P>
<P>
 But even before city officials line up developers and partners for the sports 
complex, they have to make sure there will be professional teams to fill the 
stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, city officials are struggling to put together a deal that will 
prevent the Rams from fleeing the city. Part of that deal involves remodeling 
the existing Anaheim Stadium for football only. 
</P>
<P>
 Most city officials expect the team to make a decision by the end of the year, 
but even if the Rams leave, city officials still believe they could attract 
another National Football League franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the city is in the middle of negotiations with the California 
Angels to extend the team's lease and build them a new baseball-only stadium, 
probably in the parking lot of the current stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have said stadium projects could be financed with the help of 
redevelopment funds, which were made possible after the stadium area was 
declared a redevelopment district because of damage sustained during the 
Northridge earthquake in January. Another possible funding method could be a 
surcharge on tickets to sporting events. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a good potential for the Angels and a new stadium. And that 
would leave us the Anaheim Stadium to get ready for football," Pickler said. 
"Who knows? Maybe we could get some Canadian football or Tampa Bay. I 
understand there's a couple of teams not happy with their situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Brown, the Angels president, said he is optimistic an agreement with 
the city will be reached before the end of the year that will keep the team in 
Anaheim in a new baseball-only stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say we're fairly close. There are some key issues we have to 
readdress, but both sides want it to go forward, and when that's the case, it 
usually does move forward," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 He even speculated that the city could host the 1999 All-Star baseball game 
with its new stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Bryant, a Save the Rams member and president of the Rams Booster Club, 
said he supports the sports complex concept in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it would enhance tourism, which is what we'd like to do in the 
county, not just rely on Disneyland and Knott's," Bryant said. "A sports 
tourist is a good tourist and it's better for county to have wide range of 
tourist attractions." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Charles Ahlers, president of the Anaheim/Orange County Visitor and 
Convention Bureau: "The visitor industry is paramount to the future of the 
city, (which) has to make some investments to move forward and capture that 
opportunity."

SERBS DEMAND THE SURRENDER OF BIHAC; BALKANS: AS REBELS CLOSE IN, THEY THREATEN

 Serbian nationalists besieging the Bihac "safe area" in Bosnia-Herzegovina on 
Saturday ordered its Muslim defenders to surrender or face annihilation -- a 
catastrophe the U.N. peacekeeping mission said it was powerless to prevent. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian and Croatian Serb rebels have positioned surface-to-air missiles 
around their artillery emplacements to ward off NATO air strikes aimed at 
halting their onslaught, said an official at U.N. Protection Force headquarters 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most critical thing about Bihac is that there are SAM batteries to the 
south, which makes it a bit of a deterrent for us, and it's critical for NATO 
as they risk having their planes shot down," said the official, who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. "From a tactical and technical point of view, there is 
little UNPROFOR can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Two British Tornado fighter planes were fired at Saturday with one 
surface-to-air missile as they flew a routine air patrol over the Serb-held 
town of Donji Vakuf in central Bosnia, reported Capt. Jim Mitchell, a spokesman 
at NATO's Southern Command in Naples, Italy. Neither plane was hit, and NATO 
made no immediate threat of retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. mission's decision to hold fire as Serbian gunmen advanced deeper 
into Bihac outraged Bosnian Prime Minister Haris Silajdzic, who accused the 
U.N. special envoy for the Balkans, Yasushi Akashi, of condemning those in the 
purported safe area to death. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Akashi is responsible for the deaths of 70,000 people in (the city of) 
Bihac," Silajdzic told reporters in Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, after 
reportedly being told by NATO that no protective air strikes could be launched 
because the U.N. authorities "do not want to turn the key." 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. commanders in Bosnia and officials of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization operate a "dual-key" approach to using air power, meaning that 
both forces must endorse any air strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Silajdzic said he had appealed to NATO Secretary General Willy Claes to take 
action to protect civilians in Bihac but was told the Western alliance was 
powerless to move without U.N. support. 
</P>
<P>
 Bihac's mayor, Hamdija Kabiljaqic, said the city's residents were in panic. If 
Bihac fell overnight, he told news agencies, there would be a "slaughter." 
</P>
<P>
 A senior U.N. civilian affairs officer in Sarajevo acknowledged to journalists 
there that the mission had failed in its task of maintaining the six 
U.N.-designated safe areas for civilian victims of the 32-month-old war. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite clear that we have failed to deter an attack on the safe area," 
Colum Murphy said. "We were supposed to deter attacks on civilians and to 
protect the civilian population." 
</P>
<P>
 Continued heavy fighting was reported in and around Bihac a day after NATO 
warplanes were summoned to conduct air strikes against the besieging rebels, 
only to be called back before dropping their payloads. 
</P>
<P>
 Some U.N. commanders fear that flexing NATO's military muscle might bring 
reprisals against peacekeepers in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a limit to how much force we can use in a peacekeeping mission," Lt. 
Gen. Michael Rose, the U.N. commander in Bosnia, told the British Broadcasting 
Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the rebels continued to ignore repeated U.N. warnings to cease 
attacks on Bihac, there was no call for NATO air power Saturday, U.N. mission 
spokeswoman Claire Grimes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aid workers and Bosnian officials told news agencies that the Serbian rebels 
resumed their heavy artillery pounding of the safe area at daybreak. 
</P>
<P>
 But Grimes said U.N. military observers in the area judged the detonations to 
be Serbian antiaircraft rockets being fired over, rather than into, the safe 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are exploding in midair. It's not shelling. Maybe they are being used 
for effect, to scare the 5th Corps," Grimes said, referring to the Bosnian 
government troops from the Bihac region. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 3-week-old Serbian assault on Bihac, which followed a dramatic 
breakout of Bosnian government troops from the pocket and their capture of some 
strategic territory, the rebels have grabbed back all that they lost and about 
one-third of the U.N.-designated safe zone. Thousands of Muslims from the 
seized area fled in panic into Bihac's crowded city center. 
</P>
<P>
 Conditions were described as "desperate." Refugees huddled in cellars and 
shelters in Bihac, which has been cut off from most humanitarian aid since May 
by the Croatian Serbs who control the territory west and north of the pocket 
and have been backing the Bosnian Serbs, who hold all land to the east and 
south. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. actions in regard to Bihac were being limited to diplomacy, Grimes said, 
noting that a civilian official had traveled to Bosnian Serb headquarters in 
Pale, near Sarajevo, to press the rebels to agree to a cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the U.N. Security Council met in emergency session Saturday and 
adopted a statement condemning the Serbs' "flagrant and blatant" entry into 
Bihac and calling on all parties to negotiate a cease-fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The council said the cease-fire should be pursued as part of an overall 
settlement for Bosnia proposed by the five-nation "Contact Group" on the 
Balkans conflict -- the United States, Russia, Germany, France and Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 And three U.S. warships carrying 2,000 Marines were headed closer to the 
region. The Pentagon had announced Friday that it had dispatched the troops to 
the Adriatic Sea to help rescue peacekeepers if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebel Serbs took more than 250 Canadian, French, Russian and Ukrainian U.N. 
peacekeepers hostage Thursday to deter threatened air strikes. And 1,200 
Bangladeshi soldiers have been trapped in the Bihac area in northwestern Bosnia 
for days. 
</P>
<P>
 But the touchiness of any American involvement in the Bosnia morass was 
demonstrated once more when Sen. Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas, one of the 
most international-minded Republicans in the Senate, objected to the deployment 
of Marines even to evacuate U.N. peacekeepers. 
</P>
<P>
 Kassebaum, interviewed on CNN's "Evans and Novak" program, said, "We have said 
we weren't going to send ground troops in." Asked by Rowland Evans, "So you do 
not think any Marines should go ashore?" she replied, "No, I don't, under the 
circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 At the United Nations, where U.S. Ambassador Madeleine Albright briefed the 
Security Council about the deployment, a U.S. official said the Marines were 
dispatched only as "a precautionary measure" in case protection or evacuation 
of American, allied or U.N. personnel is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic derided the move, telling reporters: 
"(They) send 2,000 Marines, then they have to send 10,000 more to save the 
2,000 . . . that's the best way to have another Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian Serb military hierarchy had demanded that Bosnian government 
forces defending what is left of the Bihac enclave surrender by 8 p.m. 
Saturday, local time. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are completely surrounded," chief of staff Gen. Manojlo Milovanovic said 
in an ultimatum broadcast by rebel-controlled television. "If you don't want to 
think about your lives, you ought to think about the lives of your civilian 
population." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. mission had no immediate reports on what transpired after the 
deadline passed. 
</P>
<P>
 Aid workers with the Office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees in the 
pocket reported heavy fighting around Bihac's hospital, which is thronged with 
wounded, said the refugee agency's Zagreb spokesman, Peter Kessler. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting and "ethnic cleansing" have already displaced 2 million people in 
Bosnia and eft 200,000 dead or missing. 
</P>

<P>
 Turning nuclear-bomb waste into glass logs looked like a safe and economical 
way to handle 35 million gallons of radioactive sludge back in 1981, when the 
Energy Department began designing a treatment plant in South Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
 But today, the sludge -- so radioactive that it can kill a person in minutes 
-- remains in underground tanks at the Savannah River nuclear weapon plant. Six 
years behind schedule and $1 billion over budget, the Westinghouse Corp. plant 
is another year away from starting up the glass melter. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant is an "embarrassment," acknowledged Thomas Grumbly, environmental 
management chief at the Energy Department. While recent tests at Savannah River 
have raised his hopes that its technical defects have been fixed, Grumbly 
worries that further maladies may be lurking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Murphy walks the halls of the Energy Department," he said, referring to 
Murphy's Law, which holds that anything that can go wrong will go wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with the melter is emblematic of a broad legacy of mismanagement 
and inefficiency that has dogged efforts to clean up U.S. nuclear waste left 
from decades of frenetic Cold War bomb production. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1950 to 1990, the federal weapon complex produced, on average, more than 
four nuclear bombs a day, leaving behind all the waste in about 9,000 
production buildings, tank farms, ponds, burial pits and other sites across the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Plutonium, uranium and other radioactive poisons have contaminated the soil at 
thousands of spots. Even with the best environmental practices, the waste will 
pose a risk to health and safety for more than 10,000 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite $23 billion in government spending since 1989, the nuclear waste 
problem looms larger than ever and is more intractable, principally because 
federal bureaucrats badly miscalculated the depths of the problem at the 
outset. A recent General Accounting Office report lambasted the Energy 
Department's performance, saying "little cleanup has resulted." 
</P>
<P>
 The decontamination of old bomb plants and management of nuclear waste is by 
far the largest environmental program in the world, costing taxpayers $6.1 
billion this year alone. In only five years, the program has mushroomed into a 
massive commercial undertaking but without an industrial infrastructure, 
contracting system or technology base to fully support the job. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, the Energy Department has tied its own hands by signing legal 
agreements with states and other federal agencies, which it has neither the 
money nor technology to meet. As a result, the department has been left open to 
a barrage of lawsuits that is usurping federal policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorado sued when the Energy Department couldn't meet its cleanup schedule. 
Nevada sued to keep out Ohio's radioactive dirt. South Carolina went to federal 
court in an effort to block a shipment of foreign fuel rods. 
</P>
<P>
 As matters stand, deciding which contaminated places to clean first "is being 
left up to courts and who has the most powerful congressional delegations and 
the meanest attorneys general," said Bob Alvarez, deputy assistant energy 
secretary. "That is not the way we should be doing business. We have a 
regulatory framework that encourages this." A Curse on Future 
</P>
<P>
 The Energy Department emerged from the Cold War a master at secretly cranking 
out sophisticated nuclear bombs to protect America's national security, but it 
was poorly equipped to protect America's environment or to reassure a 
distrustful public. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many federal programs have well-advertised failures, the consequence 
of bungling the cleanup of nuclear waste looms as a potentially toxic curse on 
future generations. Public attention and federal commitment could atrophy 
before the waste is safely contained, according to government and private 
experts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can never look our children in the eye and say we have done a great job," 
said Arjun Makhijani, president of the Institute for Energy and Environmental 
Research, a Washington group frequently critical of the Energy Department. 
"What we have done so far points in the wrong direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Estimates for the total cleanup cost are rising to staggering levels -- 
ranging from $200 billion to $600 billion. Some experts say that upcoming 
studies may put the cost at $1 trillion -- enough to buy every American family 
a new car. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration came into office with high hopes and an aggressive 
agenda to improve the process that began only during the George Bush 
Administration. Clinton's commitment has won support from congressional leaders 
worried that the program has become unaffordable. Studies Assailed 
</P>
<P>
 Grumbly is quick to acknowledge that his department has not done enough 
cleanup for the $23 billion spent so far -- a failure he blames on a management 
philosophy that encouraged interminable studies of problems before any actual 
work could begin. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was "spending a whole lot of money feathering the nests of 
consultants and other . . . beneficiaries to the program rather than spending 
those dollars on the real environmental risks that we have," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Grumbly has promised Congress that his department will cut the cost of 
major projects by 20% and has already proclaimed it will exceed its 1994 
cleanup goals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Energy Department hopes to improve efficiency by opening competition on 
contracts worth $31 billion and has brought in high-tech firms, such as TRW 
Inc. and Lockheed Corp. to apply robotics and space technology. It is ending 
contracts that simply reimburse firms for their billings, which created little 
incentive to hold down costs. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also adding 1,200 employees to shore up its relatively small staff of 
civil servants who supervise and audit cleanups. Until recently, the 
department's environmental program had 1,800 employees overseeing more than 
42,200 contractor employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The remedies, however, have had little time to show real results and strong 
evidence continues to mount that the cleanup is going poorly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not intend to shovel billions of dollars into this program without 
seeing some results," Sen. J. Bennett Johnston (D-La.), a congressional 
powerbroker on nuclear issues, said at a hearing last year. "To say the program 
has been mismanaged in prior years is . . . a vast understatement." 
</P>
<P>
 The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board, an independent federal agency, 
has issued a series of reports finding poor safety standards, lethargic action 
and inadequate training. In a recommendation last May, it warned of "imminent 
hazards" of radioactive leakage from tanks, holding basins and pipes at sites 
across the nation unless action is taken within 24 months. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, the Congressional Budget Office has faulted the agency for 
investing just 7% of its budget in new technology, despite its rhetoric to the 
contrary. The General Accounting Office recently called the department's 
decision-making process "flawed." 
</P>
<P>
 At Fernald, Ohio, for example, the Energy Department wanted new management and 
hired a subsidiary of the Fluor Corp. But the Irvine-based firm quickly became 
the target of an acrimonious congressional investigation into charges that it 
billed taxpayers for a pricey Earth Day celebration, among other questionable 
spending. Oversight Blamed 
</P>
<P>
 At the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in New Mexico, the Energy Department spent 
$1.5 billion on a burial pit that it cannot open because it never obtained the 
required regulatory charters. Authorities are still trying to determine whether 
the site can safely store uranium, plutonium and other wastes. 
</P>
<P>
 In project after project, costs are out of control. Energy Department cleanup 
programs have an average cost overrun of 48%, according to a study by 
Independent Project Analysis, a firm hired by the Energy Department last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Among IPA's findings: Projects suffer from repeated changes of managers, the 
department has not learned from past mistakes and it has lax control over the 
hundreds of cleanup programs across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "DOE people have been trying to manage projects from 50,000-feet altitude," 
said Edward Merrow, the president of IPA. "In many projects, there was no 
federal employee directly responsible. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "What is at stake is whether we are able to do the cleanup. Unless the costs 
are brought down, the cleanup will not get done. The costs will be 
unaffordable." 
</P>
<P>
 Even when progress is made, the ultimate goals are unclear -- whether it is to 
ensure radioactivity remains safely confined to old bomb plants or whether it 
is to decontaminate those plants for unrestricted use. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you wanted to turn the entire nuclear defense complex into green fields on 
which we would let our children freely roam, there might not be enough paper 
down in the Treasury Department, printed in any denomination, to do that now," 
Grumbly said. "So, if that's your definition of cleanup, total green fields for 
the whole system, then I don't think even the $300-billion number buys that." 
</P>
<P>
 A parallel problem is that nobody has agreed on what standards should be met 
in cleaning up sites. Even with the best technology, some sites will have 
residual radiation above background levels, but the Environmental Protection 
Agency has not been able to set safe limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a place where as a society we do not have a consensus yet," Grumbly 
said. Sacrifice Zones 
</P>
<P>
 Some heavily polluted sites, dubbed by critics as national sacrifice zones, 
will have to be sealed off for hundreds, or possibly thousands, of years. Even 
now, the Energy Department is spending nearly half its environmental budget on 
managing and storing the waste -- not on restoration. 
</P>
<P>
 "The federal government has created profoundly contaminated zones that we 
don't have the money, resources or technology to restore to even restricted 
use," said Alvarez, the Energy Department executive. 
</P>
<P>
 Dealing with waste that will remain radioactive for thousands of years raises 
deep questions. To begin with, it is unlikely that the Energy Department or 
even the U.S. government will exist in a few thousand years. 
</P>
<P>
 The department has already lost track of where some radioactive waste is 
buried, raising questions about how it will keep precise records for thousands 
of years. Even posting warning signs at polluted sites may be a challenge 
because linguists doubt that the present English language will be spoken in the 
distant future. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress has more immediate concerns. For the first time since the program was 
launched in 1989, Congress this year cut some of its funding. The Congressional 
Budget Office wanted to go further, proposing a $630-million cutback. 
</P>
<P>
 With a furor rising in Congress, the department is loath to ask for yet more 
money. Nonetheless, Grumbly has begun warning of a "fiscal train wreck" in 
which the cost of cleaning up all the nuclear waste will outstrip the ability 
of taxpayers to foot the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few years ago, Energy Department officials had projected their 
environmental management budget would rise to $14 billion annually by the year 
2000; today the expectation is that the annual budget will rise little, if at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 With less money than expected, it would seem more urgent than ever for the 
department to address the biggest problems first. 
</P>
<P>
 As simple as that seems, it isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 The department signed about 100 legal agreements in the 1980s and 1990s with 
states and the federal Environmental Protection Agency to clean up heavily 
contaminated sites. And since then, Congress passed the Federal Facilities 
Compliance Act, allowing states to sue the Energy Department for noncompliance. 
Legal Disputes 
</P>
<P>
 But the $6.1 billion in annual spending is "woefully short" of what is 
necessary to meet those agreements, and in many cases the government is 
failing, said Victor Rezendes, a key GAO watchdog. Indeed, at a House Energy 
and Commerce Committee hearing last year, Grumbly testified that by the year 
2000, the agreements would require spending of $12 billion to $18 billion 
annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to comply with its own deals, the federal government is embroiled in 
some nasty legal disputes. What's more, the compliance agreements have forced 
the Energy Department to treat each plant as a separate program. 
</P>
<P>
 To comply with a deal signed in Ohio, for example, the Energy Department wants 
to ship 16,000 truckloads of radioactive dirt to its Nevada Test Site, 
triggering an acrimonious lawsuit a few months ago by Nevada officials who 
don't want Ohio's contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 Harry Swainson, the state's senior deputy attorney general, said the dirt 
would further contaminate a 20,000-year-old aquifer running along Nevada's 
eastern border that contains enough water to supply a million families for 800 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't shame the federal government into stopping these shipments," 
Swainson fumed. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other problems, the dirt would be trucked through downtown Las Vegas, 
raising the risk that even a non-threatening incident or spill would generate 
horrific publicity that could maim the tourist industry, Swainson said. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, the lawsuits and the risk of suits are forcing the Energy 
Department to spend money in seemingly absurd ways. 
</P>
<P>
 The department is spending about $500,000 a year pumping water at the Savannah 
River plant to maintain an artificial lake -- solely to comply with state 
regulations that have designated it as wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 The pumps originally drew cooling river water for nuclear reactors, which have 
been shut down for years. The water is discharged into what is known as L Lake 
-- an eyesore that has attracted fish and alligators. 
</P>
<P>
 By shutting the pumps, the lake would go dry and kill the fish. To comply with 
state regulations, the department must continue pumping 25,000 gallons of water 
a minute into the lake, according to a Savannah River plant spokesman. Leaks 
Urgent 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, 67 out of 177 tanks of high-level radioactive waste are leaking 
into the soil at the Hanford Reservation in Washington state, posing one of the 
more urgent contamination problems. The Defense Nuclear Facilities Safety Board 
has advocated quicker action in dealing with the tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 And at the Nevada Test Site the department has yet to conduct an environmental 
study of about 1,000 bomb craters left from underground nuclear tests that 
created serious radioactive contamination in the water table, state officials 
complain. 
</P>
<P>
 To deal with such inconsistencies, the Energy Department is attempting to 
renegotiate the agreements, hoping to create a more realistic cleanup schedule. 
Colorado Assistant Atty. Gen. Daniel Miller said his state is being reasonable, 
talking with other states and federal groups to find an alternative to court 
fights. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless Colorado also brought an administrative complaint against the 
Energy Department for failing to meet a 1991 cleanup agreement at the Rocky 
Flats bomb plant. The department paid a $2.8-million fine last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Political battles between state congressional delegations for cleanup funds 
are rising, said Alvarez. 
</P>
<P>
 "That pressure is there, and it is growing because of the amounts of money 
involved," he said. "Progress is measured by how much you spend." 
</P>
<P>
 But outsiders express it a different way: "It is pork, that's the cynical way 
of putting it," said Merrow, the IPA president. "Each site views getting their 
cleanup dollars in survival terms, and court orders help them with that 
survival . . . by putting pressure on headquarters to keep money flowing." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the department is hoping to improve performance with new cleanup 
technology, like the $2-billion glass melter in South Carolina. Although 
transforming waste into glass -- a process called vitrification -- is widely 
supported, the department's approach has been controversial and costly. 
</P>
<P>
 If the plant works perfectly, it would run 24 hours a day and fill its 5,000th 
canister with the last of the sludge in 2019. But the plant has a far from 
perfect record. Du Pont Bows Out 
</P>
<P>
 Chemical giant Du Pont & Co. started the design work in 1981 with a schedule 
to start operations in 1989. But after Du Pont got out of the nuclear business, 
the Energy Department concluded the plant had been designed to safety standards 
suitable for the chemical industry, not the more stringent requirements of the 
nuclear industry. An evaluation and redesign by Westinghouse, the new 
management firm, took years. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant's prospects began to improve until April, 1993, when an accident 
revealed new flaws. During testing, the melter unexpectedly filled with water, 
triggering hundreds of alarms. 
</P>
<P>
 A resulting Energy Department investigation found that Westinghouse operators 
had become so accustomed to warning alarms that they failed to take appropriate 
action. The probe also uncovered inadequate training, poorly designed 
responsibilities for managers and the use of unauthorized procedures. A number 
of design changes were ordered as well. Westinghouse officials declined to be 
interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 Had nuclear waste been inside the plant, it would have caused a major 
contamination of the building, critics charge. Drying out the melter caused a 
10-month delay. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Cochran, a scientist on the Natural Resource Defense Council, 
criticized the design for having one melter rather than a series of smaller 
backup melters inside a single plant. 
</P>
<P>
 And the safety board has cited such inadequacies as the plant's 
fire-protection system, its hazard warning system and its seismic standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant, originally estimated to cost $1 billion, will end up costing about 
$2 billion, not including another $2 billion in related treatment facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have built it cheaper," acknowledged Mario Fiori, the Energy 
Department's chief at Savannah River. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is academic. We need this facility. It is going to operate for 30 years, 
and it is a technology we are going to export to other Energy Department 
sites." 
</P>
<P>
 Compared to the cost of the nuclear arms race, projects like the melter might 
even be regarded as a bargain. The United States has spent an estimated $4 
trillion on nuclear bombs, missiles and command systems since World War II, 
said Stephen I. Schwartz, guest scholar at the Brookings Institution think 
tank. 
</P>
<P>
 A series of recent tests in which non-radioactive glass was poured from the 
melter were highly successful, said Steve Richardson, the chief government 
official at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Waste processing operations are scheduled to begin in late 1995. The Energy 
Department plans to store the glass logs at Savannah River only temporarily. 
South Carolina is adamantly opposed to permanent storage. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the Energy Department intends to bury the logs at Yucca Mountain, 
Nev. In 1,000 to 10,000 years, the radioactivity in the logs would decay 
significantly and the problem would theoretically be gone. 
</P>
<P>
 In the worst fears of the most staunch environmentalists, however, such 
repositories could leak radioactive waste into public water supplies or, even 
worse, explode into a radioactive steam cloud that would annihilate life on 
Earth. Most experts believe that such fears are preposterous. 
</P>
<P>
 "The repository shouldn't be any more dangerous than a (benign) uranium ore 
body," Cochran said. "We shouldn't make society any worse off than if we hadn't 
mined an ore body to begin with." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Nevada authorities have been gearing up for a future battle to 
block Yucca Mountain from opening, another roadblock confronting the Energy 
Department's cleanup agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 Swainson, the state's senior deputy attorney general, has a suggestion for 
Energy Department officials on an alternative burial site for the glass logs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let them bury it at the Mall in Washington," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get a little bitter about this." Keeping Nuclear Waste Safe 
</P>
<P>
 The search for safer ways to store radioactive waste has led to a process 
called vitrification, in which sludge is transformed into glass. Here's how the 
process at one site is supposed to work: 
</P>
<P>
 1) The plant has 35 million gallons of radioactive sludge in underground 
tanks, left by the production of plutonium and tritium for bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 2) The sludge is pumped from the tanks into the defense waste processing 
facility. Mercury is removed and 150-pound batches of sludge are mixed with 
3,500 pounds of special sand, called frit, and chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 3) The mixture is fed into a smelter, where water is boiled out of the sludge. 
A special filtration system captures any remaining radioactive particles from 
the steam. 
</P>
<P>
 4) The melted mixture is poured into stainless steel canisters, which are 
sealed and loaded into a shielded transporter. 
</P>
<P>
 5) The cannisters, generating nearly as much heat as a 1,500-watt portable 
hair dryer, are lowered into concrete pits for "interim" storage. 
</P>
<P>
 Paying for the Cleanup 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Energy will spend more than $6 billion this year cleaning up 
nuclear plants. Here is a list of all the plants and the costs of cleaning them

NEWS ANALYSIS; BOSNIA PEACEKEEPING ROLE MAKES U.N. FORCES PAWNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAROL J. WILLIAMS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The see-no-evil neutrality embraced by the United Nations in the midst of 
savage nationalist bloodletting has step by step transformed the 50,000-strong 
U.N. Protection Force in the Balkans from a peacekeeping mission into an army 
of pawns. 
</P>
<P>
 The international community's determination to limit its involvement in the 
war-torn region to humanitarian ventures -- instead of military intervention to 
stop the fighting -- has increasingly put the men and women of a misguided 
mission in harm's way. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of U.N. troops are being held hostage by angry Serbian rebels in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as a hedge against further use of NATO air power. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,200 Bangladeshi soldiers in embattled Bihac in northwestern Bosnia are 
battened down in their quarters to escape the artillery siege raining death 
onto the local civilians they were deployed to protect, just as U.N. 
contingents assigned to besieged eastern enclaves became fellow captives with 
the Muslims in their care. 
</P>
<P>
 From the rebel-encircled enclaves of Srebrenica, Gorazde and Zepa, to the 
mission headquarters here that Croatian Serbs have threatened with Frog 
missiles, U.N. soldiers and statesmen are at the mercy of the Serbian warriors 
who have always had the upper hand and now show no restraint in their will to 
use it. 
</P>
<P>
 By steadfastly refusing to take sides, the U.N. mission is seen by its 
intended beneficiaries not as neutral so much as indifferent. 
</P>
<P>
 Symbolic displays of NATO resolve to protect U.N. "safe areas" have failed to 
impress the rebel forces attacking them or to convince the civilian victims 
that the outside world even cares. 
</P>
<P>
 With its choice of a peacekeeping mission over military intervention at the 
start of the conflict in Bosnia more than 2 1/2 years ago, the international 
community gambled that ignoring injustices would facilitate a pragmatic 
settlement and at least a tentative peace. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the relentless rebel assault on Bihac -- one of six purported 
U.N.-protected safe zones -- it has become clear that the often-brandished but 
little-used sword of North Atlantic Treaty Organization air power is not taken 
seriously by the advancing Serbian forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor are the international community's vows to prevent the fall of Bihac being 
given much weight by Bosnian government forces, who have been given an 
ultimatum by the surrounding Serbs to surrender or die. 
</P>
<P>
 The deterioration of U.N. and NATO authority in the Balkans has been gradual 
but steady, starting with the proclamation of a "no-fly" zone over Bosnia more 
than two years ago that is violated almost daily. The alliances' lack of 
respect accelerated with the non-enforcement of other so-called safe areas in 
eastern Bosnia, and more recently with the failure to enforce weapons exclusion 
zones around Gorazde and Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 Four Serbian planes caught on a Feb. 28 bombing run in central Bosnia were 
shot down by NATO in the only enforcement action of the flight ban, and several 
pinprick air strikes have been launched against antiquated artillery in the two 
exclusion zones. 
</P>
<P>
 But Serbian nationalist rebels who have been the targets of the few punitive 
NATO actions have concluded that neither the U.N. mission nor the military 
hierarchies making up NATO have any intention of getting any more deeply or 
effectively involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Serbs know now that the price for shooting at U.N. troops or at U.N. 
planes is that they lose a rusted, 40-year-old gun or a derelict tank," said a 
Western diplomat in this Croatian capital. "That's not likely to constitute 
much of a deterrent." 
</P>
<P>
 Compounding the U.N. mission's lack of credibility with any of the warring 
factions is the piecemeal approach to negotiating local cease-fires that has 
taken precedence over a comprehensive strategy for combatting the aggressive 
nationalism at the root of the regional conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission is also hampered by the revolving door of administrative leaders 
and commanders, with virtually none of the major players having more than a 
year of familiarity with the complex region that began its slide toward violent 
confrontation in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little recognition among the mission leaders or their legion of 
information officers of the deja vu quality of the Bihac crisis, a carbon copy 
of the humiliating contest of wills the U.N. peacekeeping force lost to Serbian 
rebels in Gorazde in April. 
</P>
<P>
 In both deadly Serbian offensives, the U.N. commander for Bosnia, British Lt. 
Gen. Michael Rose, disputed the significance of the safe-area violations, then 
blamed the Bosnian government for spurring the attacks by trying to recover 
homes and territory lost to the Serbs at the start of the war. 
</P>
<P>
 When diplomatic appeals for respect of the safe areas were ignored by the 
advancing gunmen, U.N. officials claimed they were unsure exactly what 
territory was to be protected. Even after the mission succeeded in shrinking 
the area of its responsibility to the immediate vicinity of Bihac city -- 
encompassing only 32 square miles of the 800-square-mile "Bihac pocket" -- 
moves to enhance security for the embattled populations were slowed by the 
arthritic bureaucracies of both NATO and the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian rebels had already conquered one-third of the Bihac safe area by 
Saturday and were threatening a rout of the entire haven, yet the United 
Nations had still not acted on NATO recommendations that the area be declared a 
demilitarized zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. mission has been assuring the international community that neutrality 
continues to be the best of its few bad choices for influencing the Balkan 
conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 And the outside world's reluctance to consider the alternative to a failed 
peacekeeping mission -- military intervention -- bolsters the U.N. hierarchy's 
determination to keep its fig leaf in place over the unraveling Balkans.

CONGRESS' COURSE AWAITS SELECTION OF GOP LEADERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For all the talk about the new Republican agenda and the sea change that swept 
across American politics on Nov. 8, it will take one more set of elections to 
chart the ideological course that the 104th Congress will follow in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Those elections, to be held over the next two weeks as Republicans and 
Democrats vote to fill leadership positions in the House and the Senate, will 
help determine just how confrontational or cooperative the new Congress will be 
in its dealings with the Clinton White House. 
</P>
<P>
 With Sen. Bob Dole of Kansas and Rep. Newt Gingrich of Georgia running 
uncontested for the top Senate and House leadership spots on the Republican 
side, the most interesting GOP contest is the battle between Alan K. Simpson of 
Wyoming and Trent Lott of Mississippi for the job of Senate majority whip. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate leadership races usually turn into personality contests in which egos 
and grudges and favors given and received play decisive roles in the outcome. 
But in this case, Lott's challenge to Simpson, the incumbent GOP whip, reflects 
a broader ideological struggle over who will control the GOP agenda next year 
-- Gingrich as House Speaker (Lott is his ally) or Dole as Senate majority 
leader (Simpson is his man). 
</P>
<P>
 Among Democrats, the race for minority leader in the House is seen as a 
signpost of the direction the dispirited former majority party will take as it 
tries to recover from its resounding defeat at the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 For the White House, one thing is ominously clear: Be they old-fashioned 
liberals or more conservative "new Democrats," most of the candidates in the 
Democratic races are already signaling their independence from President 
Clinton, whom they blame in large measure for their party's midterm losses. 
</P>
<P>
 House Democrats will meet to fill their leadership slots Wednesday, while 
House Republicans vote the following Monday. The leadership races in the 
Senate, for both Republicans and Democrats, will be decided Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are the key leadership races, and what's at stake: 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, the race for Republican whip is capturing most of the 
attention. Not only is it the No. 2 leadership spot, it is seen by Republicans 
and Democrats alike as a proxy struggle between Dole and Gingrich. Although 
they put on a good show of unity at the recent Republican Governors Assn. 
meeting in Williamsburg, Va., Dole and Gingrich have made little secret of 
their dislike for each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dole's not the barn-burner that Gingrich is," said a Senate colleague, 
describing the difference between the two men. "He'd rather redecorate the barn 
than raze it to the ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Dole's more pragmatic and flexible approach to governing worries Gingrich 
supporters in the House, who fear some of the GOP's more ambitious ideas for 
economic and social reform will stall in the Senate. Their concerns are not 
unfounded, considering Dole's disdain for the supply-side economic theory that 
underpins the Gingrich camp's tax-cut proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 The extremely close Lott-Simpson race is a byproduct of these differences, and 
the outcome could sharply limit Dole's maneuvering room in running the Senate, 
as well as complicate his likely presidential campaign in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Lott, a close ally of Gingrich's, is expected to team up with another Dole 
rival, Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas. Working together, they could force Dole to 
move further to the right or isolate him within the GOP Senate leadership in 
much the same way that retiring Minority Leader Robert H. Michel of Illinois 
was hemmed in by Gingrich and other GOP conservatives during his last year in 
the House. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Lott wins the No. 2 spot, it will also make it very difficult for Dole to 
go off campaigning for the presidency, because he won't be able to trust Lott 
to mind the store in his absence," said a senior GOP Senate aide. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Dole has endorsed Simpson for whip, while Gramm, who has 
already announced his intention to seek the presidency in 1996, has endorsed 
Lott. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Senate leadership elections only a week away, the Simpson-Lott race 
is considered too close to call. Lott's supporters say they are confident he 
will win. Simpson says that calculation is based on the shaky assumption that 
all 11 freshman senators will vote for Lott. 
</P>
<P>
 "The job of whip is learned in the third grade. It's learning how to count, 
and I've got my count," Simpson says, indicating he is comfortable with his 
tally, even though he refuses to reveal it. Lott, he adds, "assumes he will get 
all the new guys, but he won't." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the Democrats, Sen. Christopher J. Dodd of Connecticut is mounting a 
strong challenge to Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota for Senate minority 
leader. Still the front-runner, Daschle thought when he entered the race to 
succeed retiring Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) that he would be 
running for a different job and against another opponent. But that was before 
the Nov. 8 elections, which threw the Democrats into the minority and resulted 
in the defeat of Daschle's leadership opponent, Sen. Jim Sasser of Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodd entered the race after the elections. He has picked up most of Sasser's 
support in what is seen as a generational and personality contest rather than 
an ideological dispute, given the fact both men represent the liberal wing of 
the party. Daschle is 46 and has served in the Senate since 1986; Dodd is 50 
and was first elected in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas Daschle appeals to younger colleagues who feel the Democrats need a 
new and energetic leader to guide them safely through the post-election 
political desert, Dodd draws his strength more from senior senators who fear 
Daschle may be too young and inexperienced to deal with Dole. 
</P>
<P>
 A Daschle aide says the senator already has enough votes to win. A Dodd 
spokesman disputes that count, saying both men are "neck-and-neck," with the 
outcome hinging on a few undecided votes. 
</P>
<P>
 A more ideological confrontation is unfolding in the House, where conservative 
Democrats are challenging their party's liberal leadership for the top two 
minority positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Charlie Rose of North Carolina and Charles W. Stenholm of Texas are portraying 
themselves as centrist alternatives to the remnants of a liberal leadership 
that many Democrats blame for squandering their chances of governing 
effectively over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Rose, who is challenging current Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt of 
Missouri for the minority leader's job, and Stenholm, who is seeking to take 
the whip's job away from David E. Bonior of Michigan, are rated as dark-horse 
candidates at best. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fact they are challenging the leadership is a sign of turbulence and 
unrest within the Democratic Party as it gropes for answers and seeks to 
redefine itself in the aftermath of the elections. 
</P>
<P>
 "The legitimacy of the Democratic leadership is completely open right now," 
said William Schneider, a political scientist with the American Enterprise 
Institute. "There really is no leadership now because their old leadership has 
been discredited, and there is no obvious heir, . . . no one who's shown they 
can pick up the pieces of a party that's just falling apart." 
</P>
<P>
 No such divisions are yet apparent on the GOP side of the House, where 
Gingrich is certain to become Speaker and Dick Armey of Texas is running 
unopposed for majority leader. But a tight three-way race is shaping up for the 
whip's post among Robert S. Walker of Pennsylvania, Bill McCollum of Florida 
and Tom DeLay of Texas. 'Contract With America'

LITTLE EVIDENCE FOUND FOR VOTER FRAUD CLAIMS; ELECTION: OFFICIALS AGREE 
REGISTRATION LISTS ARE FLAWED, BUT SAY CHARGES OF WIDESPREAD ILLEGAL BALLOTING 
ARE UNFOUNDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Allegations of balloting misdeeds are floating through the air like the yellow 
leaves of autumn. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Senate candidate Mike Huffington, refusing to concede defeat, raises 
concerns that "massive voting irregularities" may have led to his loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Backers of the victorious Proposition 187 form a voter fraud task force, 
citing reports of non-citizens going to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 A Los Angeles County supervisor demands an investigation into purported 
incidents of voter registration fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics bemoan the degree to which California's voting laws rely on the honor 
and goodwill of residents. They say that the voting rolls are clogged with 
deadwood and that the system -- which does not demand proof of voter 
identification -- is ripe for abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 But just how much evidence is there that the system is indeed abused on a 
widespread basis? 
</P>
<P>
 Election officials concede that there are problems with registration lists -- 
because of both innocent mistakes and deliberate fraud by paid bounty hunters 
who register voters for political campaigns. But they insist there is no 
indication that those problems have translated into widespread illegal 
balloting. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do have a lot of duplicates on the file because we don't have an effective 
purge program," acknowledged acting Secretary of State Tony Miller. "On the 
other hand, there is very little evidence of actual voter fraud." 
</P>
<P>
 A recent search of voting records by the Orange County registrar's office 
backs up that statement. Spurred by allegations of illegal registrations, the 
office combed the Orange County registration roll of 1.2 million voters. 
Workers found about 5,000 pairs of duplicate names. "But in every one of these 
cases," Orange County Registrar Donald Tanney said, "we could not find any 
evidence that people had voted twice." 
</P>
<P>
 Even those who are raising the issue are hard pressed to substantiate their 
claims. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't produce the hard-core evidence at the moment," said Bill King of the 
voter fraud task force formed by Proposition 187 backers -- who suspect 
non-citizens illegally voted against the anti-illegal immigration initiative. 
"But I'm confident we'll turn up enough to make the pursuit of this 
worthwhile." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Jennifer Grossman, communications director of the Huffington 
campaign, cites "a flood of phone calls" about suspicious activities when asked 
for proof of improper balloting. "(We're) going to follow up on leads and find 
evidence if evidence indeed exists," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Huffington is not alone in seeing the specter of fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 In the days after this month's elections, Republican Rich Sybert raised the 
issue in his failed attempt to unseat U.S. Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson 
(D-Woodland Hills). Elsewhere in the nation, Republican Ellen R. Sauerbrey has 
cited "hundreds" of reports of voting irregularities in her refusal to concede 
that she lost the Maryland gubernatorial race by about 5,400 votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, some view complaints from the Huffington and Proposition 187 camps as 
little more than political sour grapes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that what they're doing has more of a partisan and ideological 
twist to it than actual fact," said Larry Berg, director of the Jesse M. Unruh 
Institute of Politics at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Others complain that sweeping fraud allegations can have a corrosive effect on 
the public's opinion of the election system. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a candidate for public office to make allegations of voter fraud without 
first carefully documenting the evidence and having persuasive evidence . . . 
is outrageous and irresponsible," said Tim Hodson, director of the Center for 
California Studies at Cal State Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Backers of Huffington and Proposition 187 emphatically dismissed such 
characterizations. "If there's fraud, then an investigation of fraud is a 
healthy thing and anyone who opposes such an investigation is merely covering 
up the inadequacies of the current system," Grossman retorted. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, state Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles) cried foul in her 
narrow loss to Yvonne Brathwaite Burke in a Los Angeles County supervisor's 
race. After a lengthy probe, the county district attorney's office reported 
that "our entire investigation revealed nothing more substantive than rumors, 
conjecture, speculation and innuendo." 
</P>
<P>
 The office simultaneously investigated reports that dead people and a dog were 
registered in Hawthorne during that same election season. A check by the county 
registrar indicated that no one had voted under the names of either the 
deceased or the dog. 
</P>
<P>
 There are periodic cases of voter fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 A city councilman in the Fresno County town of Parlier pleaded guilty this 
year to charges of election fraud. And allegations of improper conduct 
involving absentee ballots prompted a judge to overturn a 1987 Inglewood City 
Council election. 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles County prosecutors say that most of the allegations they 
investigate involve registration rather than actual voting. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last month, Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael Antonovich asked the 
district attorney's office to look into fraudulent voter registration activity 
in Glendale, Pasadena and Burbank after more than a quarter of the 143 
registrations from one Burbank apartment complex were found to be questionable. 
The registrations were made by bounty hunters working for a statewide voter 
registration committee headed by Assemblyman Phillip Isenberg (D-Sacramento). 
</P>
<P>
 Two women working for a Republican registration drive in Ventura County were 
also arrested last month on charges they had falsified registrations. One of 
the agents is accused of copying down names on tombstones. 
</P>
<P>
 Arrests are not common, however, because it is often difficult to identify the 
person who made the phony registrations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've looked at a number of different elections," said Los Angeles County 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Gail Erlich, "and we've either not been able to substantiate 
a crime occurred, or if we can substantiate a crime occurred, we can't identify 
the person." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the complaints Erlich and her colleagues receive come from citizens 
rather than law enforcement authorities. And they often don't stand up to 
closer scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Take, for instance, the 350 calls to the state attorney general's voter fraud 
hot line this fall. Only 165 supplied enough information to be passed on to 
investigators, said a spokesman for the office. Many of those were from Los 
Angeles County, but are proving too flimsy to pursue, said Allen Field, head 
deputy in charge of special investigations for the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 One tip the office thought had potential involved 600 fraudulent 
registrations. As it turned out, a registration drive was simply under way at a 
600-unit apartment house. 
</P>
<P>
 Concern about phony registrations was heightened this year when it was 
discovered that Mario Aburto Martinez, the convicted assassin of Mexican 
presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, had illegally registered to vote 
in Los Angeles County not once, but twice. 
</P>
<P>
 California requires no proof of identity or citizenship when people register 
or go to the polls. The voter registration application, signed under penalty of 
perjury, asks if a person is a citizen and old enough to vote, but no attempt 
is made to verify the information. Similarly, voters sign a roster when they 
vote, but their signatures are not checked. 
</P>
<P>
 Such standards are among the easiest in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone can register by mail and anyone can vote by mail. Moreover, political 
campaigns are permitted to distribute absentee ballot applications and return 
them to the registrar's office. 
</P>
<P>
 All this, some argue, is a recipe for abuse. "As long as you have a system 
where there is no way to determine if the person who registers is who they say 
they are, the question (of fraud) is always going to be raised," said Secretary 
of State-elect Bill Jones, who campaigned on the need for cleansing the rolls 
of duplicates and requiring some voter identification. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislative efforts have been made to tighten the laws. The state Senate 
passed a bill last year that would have allowed counties to require voters to 
provide proof of identity at the polls, but the proposal died in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Defenders of the current system argue that tougher requirements will only 
further depress the voter turnout. Moreover, they say, why buck a national 
trend toward loosening voting laws when there is no concrete evidence of 
extensive corruption? Last year's adoption of the "motor-voter" law by Congress 
also complicates the picture. The federal law, scheduled to go into effect Jan. 
1, mandates that states allow people to register by mail and offer voter 
registration at such government agencies as motor vehicle and welfare offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Although California Gov. Pete Wilson has ordered state agencies not to 
implement the motor-voter law unless the federal government pays the costs, the 
pending law has sparked interest in cleaning up the state's registration rolls. 
</P>
<P>
 Just about everybody agrees that the rolls contain names that shouldn't be 
there, partly because California does not actively purge the names of those who 
have not voted in several consecutive elections. The state stopped doing that 
in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, county registrars use two main methods to track whether people have 
moved: mail returned by the post office and notification of the move when a 
person registers at a new address. 
</P>
<P>
 It is by no means a foolproof system, as evidenced by a list of about 75,000 
possible duplicate registrations in Los Angeles County. The list, developed by 
computer consultants working with the Senate Select Committee on Voting 
Practices and Procedures, turned up in a brief and unsuccessful legal challenge 
to the vote count in the Huffington race. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear what percentage of the 75,000 are true duplicates -- and at this 
point, there is no evidence that they were used to cast illegal ballots. But 
"we've identified an area that we have to fix," says Karen Saranita, a 
consultant for the committee, which was established by Watson in 1992 and has 
held several hearings on voting irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who recently created a three-person unit to investigate all types of 
electioneering complaints, says his office is running a search of the statewide 
rolls to find duplicates. And while some worry that the new motor-voter law 
will encourage more registration problems, Miller and Saranita both suggest it 
may cut down on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Since most people will register to vote with the Department of Motor Vehicles, 
they say the use of bounty hunters will be greatly reduced, taking 
registrations off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "That will be a much safer place (at which to register)," Miller said.

SOLDIER'S DIARY COMES HOME AFTER 50 YEARS; WORLD WAR II: WOODLAND HILLS MAN 
THIS WEEK WILL TURN OVER THE JOURNAL TO THE DEAD AUTHOR'S FAMILY IN JAPAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Through three generations, the dead Japanese soldier's diary remained tucked 
away in Albert Elsbernd's bottom desk drawer, a mysterious journal in a 
complicated foreign script, a former enemy's thoughts on a war waged half a 
century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Picked up in a battle-scarred building in the Philippines in 1945, brought 
home to a 14-year-old Elsbernd by a returning U. S. soldier, the indecipherable 
chronicle was treasured as a young boy's war memento. But years later, the book 
began to eat at Elsbernd, who came to see it as something that had to be 
returned to its rightful owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, nearly 50 years afterward, Elsbernd's mysterious war trophy is on its way 
home: With the help of his nephew Mark Elsbernd -- a Woodland Hills 
manufacturing engineer for a Japanese-owned company -- the leather-bound volume 
is finally being returned to relatives of Kazumi Nemoto, the Japanese soldier 
who wrote it shortly before he died. 
</P>
<P>
 In a private meeting Wednesday in the northern Japanese town of Samekawa, 
about 200 miles north of Tokyo, 38-year-old Mark Elsbernd will turn over the 
book on behalf of his uncle, ending a search that was aided by top-level 
Hitachi executives and the Japanese press. 
</P>
<P>
 "This world really is a pretty small place," said Mark Elsbernd before he left 
Woodland Hills on Saturday for Japan. "The fact this diary can be returned to 
the hands of this man's relatives is pretty fantastic. It shows that love of 
family can outlast the ugliness of any war." 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Elsbernd learned of the saga last month when he was contacted by his 
uncle Albert, a 64-year-old retired Cincinnati police officer, about the diary 
that Albert Elsbernd had kept in a bottom-drawer shoe box, tucked away with the 
car insurance papers, bank statements and pictures of the kids. Mark Elsbernd, 
an engineer for Dataproducts Corp., a division of Hitachi, contacted company 
executives in Japan, who took a special interest in the project and launched a 
search for members of Nemoto's family who could claim the diary. 
</P>
<P>
 The day following a Nov. 10 story in a Japanese newspaper, Hiroshi Nemoto -- a 
70-year-old nephew of the dead soldier -- came forward from Samekawa. 
</P>
<P>
 Later pictured in a Japanese newspaper holding Kazumi's military photograph, 
the surviving Nemoto is the youngest of seven children who had long given up 
hope of collecting any more mementos of his dead uncle. He and his siblings are 
Nemoto's closest known living relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Friends of mine have joked that these people are going to be angry with me 
when I get over there," Mark Elsbernd said. "They say they're going to hang me 
from a tree somewhere. But the family is just so grateful that this book is 
being returned. The war is over. This is a matter between peaceful people, not 
soldiers." 
</P>
<P>
 Nemoto, a Japanese naval aircraft technician who would have been 70 this year, 
kept the diary for several months in 1945, translators said, logging not only 
personal data, but precise accounts of military movements and various aircraft 
records. Still bearing a 300-yen price tag, the book bore only three English 
words within its pages -- "stainless steel plates." 
</P>
<P>
 The diary described Nemoto's sadness over his inability to get together with a 
brother during a military leave. It also included passages describing a 
malarial disease that killed many Japanese troops in the spring of 1945 -- 
perhaps killing Nemoto as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Its final entry was not long before Nemoto's death on April 24, 1945, at the 
age of 21, according to Japanese military records. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly thereafter, the Japanese army withdrew from the Philippine village 
where the book was later found, according to the Elsbernd family. Discovered in 
a desk in an artillery-battered building, the diary was brought home by a 
boyfriend of Albert Elsbernd's older sister. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just a kid with wild aspirations about war and battles and this book 
represented something of a fantastic mystery to me," Albert Elsbernd recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was written almost entirely in Japanese, which gave it this great 
mystique. But it was something kept by a soldier, a real soldier, an enemy 
soldier. And that was breathtaking for me. So I kept it as a souvenir. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I got older and cleaned that shoe box out time and again, I never threw 
the diary away. I had this premonition that someday I would turn to it again." 
</P>
<P>
 Years passed. Albert Elsbernd himself fought in the Korean War, served nearly 
three decades on the Cincinnati Police Department and retired to a job as a 
security guard. 
</P>
<P>
 At night in bed, he would recall the way his own aunt grieved for her son, 
killed in Germany during World War II just three months after his 18th 
birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 "My cousin had been taken at such a young age that my aunt never had time to 
collect enough pictures, to have things she could look at and keep in his 
memory -- and it broke her heart," he said. "I convinced myself that this book 
might make somebody in Japan feel good, maybe lessen another mother's pain of 
losing a son so young to war." 
</P>
<P>
 Albert Elsbernd tried several times to translate the diary, looking for clues 
that might help him find the author's family. Finally, last month, he contacted 
his nephew, Mark, in Los Angeles -- knowing that as an American employee of the 
Hitachi corporation, Mark had regular contact with company executives in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 One night over dinner at a Burbank restaurant, the elder Elsbernd took the 
book from his pocket. Recalled Mark Elsbernd: "He told me, 'This is something 
I've been holding for a long time. I don't think I should keep it any longer. 
It belongs to somebody else.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Added Albert Elsbernd: "I told him, 'If you don't find anyone who wants this, 
just toss it in the ocean. That way, it could finally make its way back to 
Japan. Because I don't think its owner ever did." 
</P>
<P>
 But Mark Elsbernd didn't throw the pocket-sized notebook into the sea. 
Instead, he showed it to Katsuhide Kato, a Hitachi executive from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he saw the dairy, his eyes lit up," the engineer recalled. "He read the 
thing cover to cover. He told me, 'In Japan, this would be invaluable. In my 
country, everything is family. This is a book any family would want to have 
again.' I think the project took on a cultural significance for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Reached in Tokyo, Kato said he immediately sensed the book's value. "Had the 
circumstances been different, if Mr. Elsbernd had been an American soldier who 
had taken the diary from the body of the dead soldier Nemoto, it might have 
been a sad experience for the family. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this was not the case. The diary was being presented by someone who had 
received it as an innocent young boy, who was now a grown man with a very 
gentle heart. This gave the book more spiritual importance. And we wanted to 
help find the family." 
</P>
<P>
 Kato consulted a high-ranking Hitachi executive, Hiroshi Gonmori, now 70 -- 
who happened to have served in naval aviation in the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonmori initiated a search of military records for information on the dead 
soldier. When that failed, company executives went to a local Japanese 
newspaper. The story ran under the headline: "Please Help Search for Soldier 
Nemoto's Family." The nephew phoned the newspaper the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Elsbernd agreed to make the return on his next business trip to Japan. 
Hitachi executives will accompany him to Hiroshi Nemoto's home to present the 
diary Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 On that day, a day that has been nearly 50 years in the making, Albert 
Elsbernd will be home in Cincinnati. But he'll be at the Nemoto home in spirit, 
thinking of a young Japanese warrior he never met. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lesson here is that no matter what color your uniform, no matter what 
side of the battle you're on, you have people at home who care," Albert 
Elsbernd said. "That's what this book is about: It's about family."

SUPREME COURT TO DECIDE FATE OF TERM LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the last two elections, 24,513,439 Americans went to the polls and voted to 
limit by law the terms of their representatives in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the term-limit movement needs only five more votes. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the nine life-tenured justices of the U.S. Supreme Court will hear 
arguments on whether the Constitution permits states to fix the maximum terms 
of lawmakers in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of fixed terms for legislators is by no means novel. In fact, it was 
the norm in the early 1780s. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the notion will face a major hurdle when it is taken up by the Supreme 
Court this week: Historical accounts of the Constitutional Convention of 1787 
suggest that the delegates considered term limits for members of Congress -- 
and rejected the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 James Madison, the "father of the Constitution," even spoke up for the virtue 
of veteran lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few of the members (of Congress), as happens in all such assemblies, will 
possess superior talents (and) will, by frequent reelections, become members of 
longstanding and be thoroughly masters of the public business," Madison said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one can predict with certainty how much weight the high court will attach 
to the historical record. If the court relies on history and strikes down the 
new state laws that fix terms, the movement will be dealt a severe, though not 
necessarily fatal, blow. 
</P>
<P>
 Its leaders say they would then press for a constitutional amendment, a 
process that requires two-thirds votes of approval in the House and Senate and 
ratification by three-fourths of the state legislatures. 
</P>
<P>
 But if at least five of the nine Supreme Court justices vote to uphold term 
limits, the clock will begin ticking for U.S. senators and representatives in 
22 states, including California. In 1992, 63% of the state's voters approved an 
initiative limiting House members to three terms, or six years. Senators could 
serve no more than two terms, or 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, political momentum appears to favor the term-limit movement. It has 
already established itself as one of the more powerful political waves to sweep 
the nation in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless derailed by the high court, its proponents say, term limits will 
dramatically change the prevailing culture on Capitol Hill by replacing "career 
politicians" with "citizen legislators." 
</P>
<P>
 "To have real democracy, you have to have a citizen legislature. It can't work 
if the system is run by professional politicians," said Edward H. Crane, 
president of the Cato Institute, a libertarian group that advocates term 
limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "The power of incumbency is destroying democracy," said Paul Jacob, executive 
director of U.S. Term Limits, another advocacy group. Even in this year of the 
anti-incumbent, 91% of House members who ran were reelected, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 As these proponents of term limits see it, a steady turnover in Congress would 
keep representatives in closer touch with the people, break the power of 
seniority and reduce the influence of special interests. 
</P>
<P>
 This is, of course, not a new theory of democracy, but a very old one. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegates who came to the Constitutional Convention in Philadelphia were 
familiar with what were then known as "rotation" rules. Ten of the 13 states 
limited the terms of representatives, and the Articles of Confederation -- the 
predecessor to the Constitution -- included a specific rotation rule for the 
Congress that governed the nation in the early 1780s. "No person shall be 
capable of being a delegate for more than three years in any term of six 
years." 
</P>
<P>
 But the new generation of political reformers of that time attacked the 
rotation requirements as "leading to instability and confusion" in government 
and "depriving the people of the right of choosing persons who they would 
prefer," wrote historian Gordon S. Wood. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and the other architects of the Constitution 
frowned on the notion of a revolving door in Congress. "The greater the 
proportion of new members (in the federal legislature), the more apt they will 
be to fall into the snares that may be laid for them," Madison argued. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the convention got under way on May 25, 1787, Edmund Randolph 
proposed what was called the Virginia Plan for structuring the new federal 
government. It included a provision that would make members of Congress 
"incapable of reelection" after a certain period of service. 
</P>
<P>
 But on June 12, the delegates voted to reject that provision, and term limits 
were never again considered by the convention. 
</P>
<P>
 As the framers apparently saw it, it was better to set a few basic 
qualifications for Congress -- such as minimum age and residency in the state 
-- while leaving to the people the power to decide, through frequent elections, 
who would represent them. 
</P>
<P>
 That would leave the doors of Congress open "to merit of every description, 
whether native or adoptive, whether young or old, and without regard to poverty 
or wealth," Madison wrote in "The Federalist Papers." 
</P>
<P>
 To make sure no new qualifications for Congress would be imposed, Hamilton 
added that the minimal requirements "are defined and fixed in the Constitution 
and are unalterable by the legislature." 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court itself recited this history in the 1969 case of Adam Clayton 
Powell vs. John McCormack. Three years earlier, the House had refused to seat 
Powell who, though reelected by his Harlem constituents, was accused of 
diverting House funds for his personal use. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, the high court ordered Powell to be seated. Because the 
Constitution sets open-ended requirements for federal representatives, Congress 
itself was "without power" to set new or higher standards for elected 
representatives, the court said. 
</P>
<P>
 In their briefs to the high court, lawyers for the Clinton Administration and 
for Rep. Ray Thornton (D-Ark.) cite the constitutional history and the Powell 
ruling as reasons for striking down state term-limit laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court will consider Tuesday an Arkansas term-limit law that was 
struck down in March by the state's Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for U.S. Term Limits press two arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 First, they assert that the Constitution and the Powell ruling say Congress 
cannot add extra qualifications for representatives, but neither prevents the 
states from doing so. 
</P>
<P>
 The Constitution "contains no restrictions on state laws" on congressional 
representation, the brief says. It notes, for example, that laws in many states 
say felons cannot be elected to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, they argue that term-limit laws do not, in reality, limit a lawmaker's 
term. Rather, they deny the right to appear on the ballot after having served a 
certain number of terms. A popular incumbent could be elected as a write-in, 
they say. This argument is buttressed by the fact that the Constitution gives 
states the power to set "the times, places and manners of holding elections for 
senators and representatives." 
</P>
<P>
 The justices likely will issue a written ruling on U.S. Term Limits vs. 
Thornton (93-1456) by June. 
</P>
<P>
 Most constitutional scholars believe the court will strike down the term 
limits because history suggests they were rejected in 1787. 
</P>
<P>
 But leaders of the term-limit movement argue that the Constitution does not 
say the listed qualifications for Congress are the only ones allowed. Noting 
that the current court is inclined to defer to the voters, they hope that, as 
humorist Finley Peter Dunne once put it, the "Supreme Court follows the 
election returns."

CAUGHT ON THE BORDERLINE; SAN DIEGO MEN SAY THEY WERE FRAMED FOR CARDINAL'S 
MURDER, BUT EXTRADITION TO MEXICO IS IMMINENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEBASTIAN ROTELLA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Any day now, the U.S. marshals will come for Tarzan and Cougar, two gang 
members imprisoned in the high-rise federal jail here on charges of killing a 
Roman Catholic cardinal in Guadalajara. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeboys from the Logan Heights barrio will be shackled, turned over to 
Mexican police in a top-security operation at the border and then flown to a 
Mexican prison to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Recruited in an unprecedented alliance between a Mexican drug cartel and a 
U.S. street gang, prosecutors say, the suspects embarked on an odyssey that is 
the stuff of gangster melodrama. It culminated last year in the airport 
gunfight in Guadalajara that left the cardinal and six others dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine gang members have been arrested, all of them young foot soldiers in the 
Arellano cartel of Tijuana. They allegedly plunged into a gunslinging, 
high-rolling drug war with political dimensions far beyond the narrow universe 
of the San Diego gang known as 30th Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The death of Cardinal Juan Jesus Posadas Ocampo -- police say the Arellano 
gunmen shot him by mistake while trying to kill a rival -- shocked Mexicans. 
But 18 months later, the case has been eclipsed by raging political violence 
and intrigue. Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari did not mention the 
cardinal's death in his final speech to the country's congress recently, an 
omission lamented by critics who allege a cover-up of the killing. And the 
well-connected Arellanos have eluded capture, even traveling to Mexico City to 
proclaim their innocence at meetings with the Vatican's ambassador to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The murky political elements may never be clarified, but at the street level, 
there is no mystery: The popular wisdom has it that the alleged masterminds are 
at large while the pawns are taking the rap. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think I was going to get involved in anything like this," said Jesus 
(Cougar) Zamora Salas, a melancholy 21-year-old. "There's no evidence 
whatsoever that I shot the cardinal or that I attempted to shoot anyone at the 
airport. . . . I know they are going to torture me. I know that. And they are 
going to want me to confess to something, anything." 
</P>
<P>
 In appealing their extradition as high as the U.S. Supreme Court, Zamora and 
Carlos (Tarzan) Enrique Garcia insist that they are scapegoats. They said 
during recent interviews that authorities are sending them to their potential 
doom using weak evidence extracted through torture of fellow suspects in 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's because of the neighborhood," said the muscular Garcia, 24, whose shaved 
head and quick grin give him a cheerfully menacing air. "We are all from the 
same neighborhood, so they picked me out of a crowd. I feel like this whole 
thing is a joke. The day I go down there, it won't be a joke no more." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia and Zamora are products of a cross-border culture. Garcia was born in 
Tijuana and Zamora in San Diego; both grew up in working-class immigrant 
families in the hardscrabble Logan Heights enclave hemmed in by freeways, 
warehouses and docks. Both earned high school diplomas while running with the 
city's most violent Latino gang, police say. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia worked as a welder amid intermittent stints behind bars for drug 
possession, assault and traffic violations. Unlike Zamora, he denies gang 
affiliation. But he admits friendship with die-hard gang members such as Ramon 
(Spooky) Torres Mendez. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres, 25, was arrested in Tijuana and admitted taking part in the shootout. 
He died in a Guadalajara prison cell last fall. Police first declared it a 
homicide, then ruled the death accidental, a bizarre reversal met with 
disbelief by the press and the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he was beaten to death," Garcia said. "It had to be the police who 
killed him. I guess he thought he could handle it. He was the type that thought 
he was tougher than everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the evidence for Garcia and Zamora's extradition came from the 
statements of Torres and three others to Mexican authorities shortly after the 
cardinal's murder. Defense lawyers presented testimony from family members that 
Mexican police tortured those suspects into implicating two dozen gang members, 
many by street names. 
</P>
<P>
 However, human rights questions are beyond the limited scope of the 
extradition procedure, which focuses on whether probable cause exists for the 
defendant to be tried in another nation. Prosecutors responded to the 
allegations of torture by citing non-coercive interviews conducted in 
Guadalajara by FBI agents, in which the suspects again identified fellow gang 
members. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican attorney general's attache in Los Angeles says Zamora and Garcia 
have nothing to fear in Mexican custody. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are going to be very well guarded," said the attache, Miguel Ponce 
Edmonson. "The Mexican state must respond for their physical integrity, 
especially in a case as important as this. We want to make sure they don't even 
catch cold." 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 30 Logan Heights homeboys were allegedly recruited by the Arellanos, 
three Sinaloan brothers fighting for control of northwest Mexico's drug empire. 
Some gang members were as young as 14, but most were in their 20s. They drifted 
inexorably into organized crime, police say, after outgrowing teen-age turf 
wars. 
</P>
<P>
 The connection to the barrio was David Barron Corona, 31, a gang veterano 
known by the deferential moniker "Honorable Citizen." After serving time for a 
fatal 1979 shooting in San Diego, Barron resurfaced in Tijuana and became a 
trusted cartel lieutenant. He demonstrated his ferocity under fire in October, 
1992, when two truckloads of gangsters dispatched by rival kingpin Joaquin 
(Chapo) Guzman stormed a Puerto Vallarta nightclub. The Arellanos fled as 
Barron fended off attackers, scooping up the weapons of fallen gunmen. 
</P>
<P>
 "After that, they were making up songs about him," a federal agent said. 
</P>
<P>
 A bodyguard told FBI agents about accompanying Barron on an outing last year 
to a children's entertainment center in downtown Tijuana. "The center was 
reserved for the entire day only for David and about 40 of his family members, 
including grandparents, to celebrate the birthday of his 1-year-old boy, also 
called David." 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, Tarzan, Cougar and the others remained subservient henchmen, 
according to court documents. Barron and another veterano , Alfredo (Popeye) 
Araujo, recruited them in the barrio or at raucous Tijuana dance clubs. Their 
south-of-the-border duties allegedly ranged from contract murders to buying 
groceries to guarding palatial safe houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Hired in February of last year, Zamora says he and about 10 friends earned 
$500 a week working a wealthy hillside area of Tijuana. He admits seeing rifles 
in the homes and carrying a .38-caliber pistol, but says his only job was to 
clean up houses and cars. He says he did not know his bosses were drug 
traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had kind of an idea, but I was not sure," he said. "They just said, 'You're 
going to make some money, easy money.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A San Diego police detective said the gang members were caught up in an almost 
cinematic whirl of cash, violence and luxury. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if they had known the predicament they were going to get into, they 
wouldn't have done it," he said. "But maybe it was like a big game to them. You 
get people throwing money at you, you start thinking you're invincible." 
</P>
<P>
 Curiously, the hit squad that went after Chapo Guzman in May included gang 
members recruited only weeks earlier. Ramon Arellano, the youngest of the drug 
lords, allegedly led a dozen young men to Guadalajara, where they were issued 
assault rifles. Torres, the since-deceased gang member, told FBI agents that it 
would have been the first time in his life that he fired an AK-47. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia denies ever going to Guadalajara, though he provides no alibi. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamora admits making the trip and staying at houses stocked with weapons. But 
he denies an informant's statement to the FBI that places him among gunmen who 
cruised the city in a pickup truck, hunting for Guzman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody said anything about anything, what we were going to do or anything. We 
were there for a week and a half. Very quiet days. Then we got word, somebody 
at the house says, 'I got tickets to go back to Tijuana' " 
</P>
<P>
 Zamora says he never heard of the Arellanos or Guzman and never imagined that 
the group planned to kill anyone. He said his lack of knowledge "seems kind of 
weird, but it's true. It's like they want to keep you ignorant about it, like 
not to know nothing, not to know any names." 
</P>
<P>
 On the afternoon of May 24, police say, Cardinal Posadas arrived in the 
airport parking lot in a Ford Grand Marquis just as the Arellano gang attacked 
Guzman's entourage. The gunmen mistook the cardinal for Guzman and mowed him 
down in the front passenger seat, authorities said. A federal report described 
a "maximum-security, well-organized" ambush in which five carloads of weapons 
were strategically located in the parking lot and a federal police officer was 
enlisted to keep other police out of the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys question the official version; they maintain that their 
clients are merely fall guys. The confessions of suspects in Guadalajara 
indicate no plan for an airport ambush: They said that the mission to kill 
Guzman was called off, that they were given cash to go shopping before the 
flight to Tijuana, and that the gunfire caught them off guard. 
</P>
<P>
 One henchman showed up at the airport falling-down drunk. Another, Juan Carlos 
Mendoza Castillo, described seeing Barron and another gunman running toward the 
parking lot carrying AK-47s, but none admitted witnessing the actual shooting 
of the cardinal. When the mayhem broke out, Zamora says, he was already on the 
plane, which authorities -- in league with the gangsters -- delayed on the 
runway to aid the escape. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea that the rival gangs and the cardinal crossed paths by coincidence 
strains credulity. Many Mexicans reject the conclusion that assailants shot the 
bespectacled, 64-year-old Posadas, who was wearing black clerical garb, 14 
times at point-blank range by mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is infantile to believe that a professional gunman could confuse a priest 
with a drug trafficker," editor Jesus Blancornelas of the Tijuana weekly Zeta 
wrote last year, suggesting that the slaying was a "political crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Guadalajara's new archbishop, Juan Sandoval Iniguez, has declared publicly 
that several eyewitnesses say the murder appeared intentional. He told Zeta 
recently that the probe has bogged down and demanded a credible explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamora's attorney, David Cohen, points out that this year's assassinations of 
presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio and ruling party leader Francisco 
Ruiz Massieu bear resemblances to the cardinal's death. Young, working-class 
triggermen were arrested against a backdrop of drugs and politics in all three 
crimes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that someone must be held responsible for the shooting and 
that someone (is) a number of gang members from San Diego," he wrote in an 
appeal of a federal judge's extradition order. 
</P>
<P>
 Although authorities blame the Colosio murder on a lone gunman, critics allege 
a conspiracy of drug lords and politicians. In the Ruiz case, investigators 
have accused corrupt politicians with drug ties, but are still searching for 
the alleged masterminds. 
</P>
<P>
 As for a motive, Cohen subscribes to the conspiracy theory that the cardinal 
was slain because he favored political reform and suggests that the young gang 
members were kept in the dark about the real target. Conversely, others say the 
cardinal was somehow involved with traffickers. 
</P>
<P>
 Barron and Araujo, the highest-ranking 30th Street members in the cartel, have 
not been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The Byzantine conspiracy theories are largely irrelevant to Tarzan and Cougar, 
whose last hope is a long-shot humanitarian appeal to the U.S. State 
Department. They have steadfastly refused to cooperate with U.S. investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get arrested, you keep quiet," Garcia shrugged. "There's no reason 
why I should be afraid as long as I'm right here. I'll deal with it when I get 
down there."

 Northern California warmed up Saturday from a storm that dumped rain, hail and 
so much snow that it buried the record downfall that trapped a passenger train 
for four days in the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 But the reprieve from the kind of weather that closed main highways linking 
California and Nevada and caused power outages for 20,000 customers Friday 
could be short, the National Weather Service said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, high winds drove cold showers through the area 
Saturday morning, as a quarter of an inch of rain fell at lower elevations and 
mountains above 4,000 feet were coated with snow. 
</P>
<P>
 Winds whipped at 25 to 35 m.p.h. over most of the area with gusts up to 40 
m.p.h. A wind advisory was in effect on highways, small-craft warnings were 
issued for inner waters off the coast and gale warnings were posted for outer 
waters. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a dramatic rescue attempt by the Coast Guard, a woman died after she 
fell from a sailboat into the high, windblown seas off San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 A Coast Guard helicopter lowered a rescue swimmer to snatch the woman from the 
nine-foot swells nine miles offshore about 12:30 p.m. Rescuers attempted to 
resuscitate the victim, who was not identified, but she was pronounced dead an 
hour later at San Pedro Peninsula Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 In Vernon, a funnel-shaped "mini-twister" ripped tar paper and skylights from 
roofs of commercial buildings, sending the material spinning into the air, 
according to police and fire officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Department Battalion Chief Gary Wiskus said a startled police officer and 
civilian saw what looked like a little cyclone strike just after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could see the material whirling around inside the twister and they could 
hear a loud roaring noise," he said. There were no injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 In Palm Springs, winds gusted as high as 50 m.p.h., and on a hole of the Skins 
Game golf tournament, a wind-aided drive by Fred Couples soared 430 yards in 
the air. 
</P>
<P>
 Winds were expected to drop to 10 to 20 m.p.h. today with clear skies and high 
temperatures in the 60s, according to the National Weather Service. 
</P>
<P>
 In Northern California, Interstate 80 in the Sierra Nevada was open in both 
directions Saturday as the storm eased, Caltrans said, but chains were required 
for some stretches. The highway was closed at Donner Pass on Friday when heavy 
snow and winds gusting to 100 m.p.h. created whiteout conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 At the 7,000-foot level and a mile west of Donner Summit, the snowpack at the 
little town of Norden reached 72 inches, beating the 66 inches that fell in 
1951, according to KCBS meteorologist Mike Pechner. The winter storm that 
lasted into 1952 nearly entombed the Southern Pacific Railroad's sleek City of 
San Francisco in a slide at Yuba Gap. 
</P>
<P>
 The new storm snapped tree limbs that became laden with snow, felling them on 
power lines, said Pacific Gas & Electric spokesman Lyle LaFaver. "We have about 
20,000 people without service in an area from Eureka to Santa Cruz," he said 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the storm was good news for skiers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Conditions couldn't be better," said Sheila Walsh, spokeswoman at Boreal 
Ridge on Donner Summit. "It's sunny and brisk." 
</P>
<P>
 Relatively mild weather should last until Thursday, weather officials said.

LIKELY SITE OF ERUPTION AT MAMMOTH REASSESSED; GEOLOGY: NEW UPWELLINGS OF 
CARBON DIOXIDE SUGGEST THAT VOLCANIC ACTIVITY MAY BE MORE PROBABLE WEST OF 
TOWN. BUT THAT COULD BE 400 YEARS FROM NOW. 
</P>

<P>
 It was a snowy day, what Fred Richter calls "a full Gore-Tex and goggle day," 
when the U.S. Forest Service ranger stumbled across the latest geological 
development in this historically volcanic area. 
</P>
<P>
 While visiting a snow survey cabin beside Horseshoe Lake, below the Mammoth 
Mountain Ski Area and two miles west of town, Richter suddenly found himself 
unable to breathe and had to scramble outside for air. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until this past summer, four years later, that scientists confirmed 
that Richter had fallen victim to a carbon dioxide concentration. 
</P>
<P>
 The odorless gas, more dense than air and collecting inside the floorless 
cabin, was welling up from a recent intrusion of magma, or molten rock, miles 
below the surface of this mountain that is popular with winter skiers and 
summer cyclists. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery of the upwelling gas has caused scientists to re-evaluate the 
potential location of volcanic activity in the Mammoth area, and prompted mild 
official precautions, but Richter has more personal memories of the encounter. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I went inside . . . I suddenly found myself breathing hard," Richter 
recalled last week. "I sat down and I was breathing real hard. I went back up 
top and outside, and in a few minutes I was breathing easy." 
</P>
<P>
 After ventilating the cabin for 20 minutes, Richter went back in to retrieve 
some equipment he had left behind. This time he noticed that step by step as he 
descended a ladder, it became harder to breathe. "At the bottom, my respiration 
got very bad. I started to see stars," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A few others have had similar experiences as what scientists know as 
"degassing" from the magma slowly spreads in the vicinity. This past summer, 
Tim Russell, supervisor of snow-making crews at the Mammoth ski area, reported 
feeling lightheaded while inspecting a subterranean passage. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Forest Service says there have been no complaints from campers, skiers 
or hikers. 
</P>
<P>
 An extensive series of tests undertaken since July near Horseshoe Lake and on 
Mammoth Mountain has convinced scientists from the U.S. Geological Survey that 
it is time to reassess their view of the most likely sites of eventual volcanic 
activity nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 After four magnitude 6 earthquakes over three days in 1980, and a further 
moderately strong swarm of temblors in 1983, the scientists concluded that if 
an eruption were to occur it was most likely to be near the intersection of 
U.S. 395 and California 203 three miles east of Mammoth Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
 But a series of 1989 earthquakes under the southwest side of Mammoth Mountain, 
reflecting the new intrusion of molten rock deep below, has been followed by 
confirmation of the carbon dioxide rising from magma. The carbon dioxide has 
killed off trees in at least four areas around Mammoth. 
</P>
<P>
 Some radon has also been detected, and small amounts of hydrogen sulfide have 
long been evident at two fumaroles, or steam vents, on the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, scientists are looking closer at the area above and west of the 
town of Mammoth Lakes and its permanent population of about 5,000. Any volcanic 
activity there, which would be expected to come with ample warning, would allow 
an easier evacuation than an eruption near the highway intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been no volcanic eruption in the Mammoth area for about 500 years, 
and scientists caution that, in the words of Geological Survey hydrologist 
Michael L. Sorey, "it could come in the next 10 or 20 years, or in the next 300 
to 400. We don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 "We have nothing that says it is about to erupt, but it has erupted every 500 
or 600 years, so it's about geologically due," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Hill, the scientist in charge of monitoring seismic and volcanic 
activity around Mammoth, said, however, that another likely eventual site of an 
eruption is along the Inyo-Mono crater chain ranging 25 miles north from the 
Mammoth area to Mono Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're certainly looking more carefully at Mammoth Mountain now than we were," 
Hill said. "I don't feel it's necessarily the most likely place for something 
to happen, but it's one we want to watch." 
</P>
<P>
 Given the population around Mammoth and the number of tourists who visit, Hill 
said, more measuring instruments have been concentrated there. 
</P>
<P>
 Mammoth Town Manager Glenn Thompson, who would be in charge in an emergency, 
said, "I feel much safer than I would in Los Angeles knowing that a big one (an 
earthquake) is coming. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take this in context," he said. "We live in a beautiful place. There are no 
security problems. I don't even lock my front door." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he said, the Geological Survey has worked out a five-stage alert system 
in case a volcanic eruption seems impending, and even on the busiest ski 
weekend everyone could be removed a safe distance within hours, either in their 
own cars or in buses. 
</P>
<P>
 Thompson and other Mammoth officials note wryly that there was a lot of talk 
in the early 1980s of an eruption near the highway intersection, and a second 
paved road was built as an escape route from Mammoth in case such an eruption 
did take place. Real estate values were hurt for a while, and now it turns out 
scientists no longer seem to view that site as likely at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The dying trees, mostly lodgepole pine and red fir, have been spotted in four 
areas around the mountain. The largest die-off, besides Horseshoe Lake and its 
campground, covers 28 acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists said the trees are not dying because of excess carbon dioxide in 
the air, but from concentrations of underground gas that affect their root 
systems. A person walking or skiing through the area would not be adversely 
affected, and the scientists are still trying to learn whether a camper 
occupying a low spot overnight, without wind, might be. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, Forest Service rangers and scientists took extensive depth 
readings and put out tents to see if carbon dioxide concentrations would rise 
inside them. While the authorities had been considering closing part of the 
campground at Horseshoe Lake, depending on these studies, Sorey said initial 
results showed no carbon dioxide buildup inside the tents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We measured a flux (outpouring) of carbon dioxide that's coming out of the 
soil at a fairly rapid rate and that is clearly magmatic in origin," Sorey 
said. "Normally, with the wind passing through, once it comes out, it blows 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is probably no danger to people who are on the ground, with the 
exception of sleeping directly on the ground without a tent. . . . But it's a 
little too early to say there's no danger. I think we need to better evaluate 
the risk in the Horseshoe area." 
</P>
<P>
 The testing also showed "very high levels of carbon dioxide in the soil" high 
on Mammoth Mountain, and there are large areas of the mountain, especially 
above the timber line, that have not yet been tested. 
</P>
<P>
 About two weeks ago, Sorey said, Geological Survey scientists advised the 
Mammoth Mountain Ski Area to buy a metering device costing about $1,600 for 
checking carbon dioxide concentrations in buildings and other closed areas. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the ski area, marketing supervisor Pam Murphy, said that the 
device will be purchased but that there should be no concern about any danger. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel safer and more content than ever because the U.S. Geological Survey 
is so carefully monitoring the area, and Dave Hill has assured us any 
(volcanic) event would be detected in advance," she said. Mapping Mammoth 
Mountain 
</P>
<P>
 Areas of dead or dying trees on Mammoth Mountain show where gases are rising 
from molten rock deep below. 
</P>
<P>
 * BACKGROUND: Earthquakes under Mammoth Mountain in 1989 sparked a geologic 
process allowing carbon dioxide and radon gas to rise to the surface from a 
magma, or molten rock, intrusion beneath the mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT HAPPENED: Trees began to die in at least four areas. In some places, 
carbon dioxide -- a potentially dangerous gas when concentrated -- collected in 
cabins, trenches or even hollows. 
</P>
<P>
 * ACTION: The U.S. Geological Survey and the U.S. Forest Service are mapping 
the affected areas, to provide notice of any potential danger spots. Also, 
although there have been no reports of campers or skiers being affected, the 
Mammoth Mountain Ski Area may use a carbon dioxide meter this winter as a 
precaution.

CALIFORNIA ALBUM; AT THE ALTAR OF PUBLIC OPINION; SAN JOSE'S SCULPTURE OF AN 
AZTEC DEITY HONORS A CULTURE'S HISTORY, CITY LEADERS SAY. BUT FUNDAMENTALIST 
CHRISTIANS CALL THE FEATHERED SERPENT A SYMBOL OF EVIL THAT INVITES GOD'S 
WRATH.

<P>
 Here in the city of St. Joseph, an ancient god has arrived, evoking discord 
among the populace and transforming ordinary mortals into art critics. 
</P>
<P>
 The plumed serpent known as Quetzalcoatl, an Aztec god said to date back 3,200 
years, has been reborn in downtown San Jose as an eight-foot-tall stone 
sculpture. City leaders, who unveiled the work of art earlier this month, say 
its presence honors the indigenous people of Mexico and Central America -- and 
their descendants who live in San Jose today. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the ethnic divisiveness of Proposition 187 in the air, the sculpture 
by noted Los Angeles artist Robert Graham also has sparked a great debate over 
the place of Latinos in ancient history -- and in modern-day San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 The strongest protests have come from fundamentalist Christians, who predict 
that the monument to the pagan deity will provoke the wrath of their God, 
triggering violence among men and wreaking havoc on their city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe an idol like this put in the middle of a city center can bring 
God's judgment on a city," said Chet Gallagher, whose small Word in Warfare 
Christian sect held a four-day vigil near the sculpture last weekend, reading 
the Bible out loud from start to finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino leaders welcome the sculpture as one of the few symbols in California 
honoring the civilization that flourished in what is now Southern Mexico and 
Guatemala long before the Spanish conquerors arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let us acknowledge the true history of America," said playwright Luis Valdez 
at the ceremony unveiling the sculpture. "This is an indigenous monument that 
celebrates the roots of American culture." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose, the largest California city north of Los Angeles, originally planned 
to honor not Quetzalcoatl but Capt. Thomas Fallon, who in 1846 was the first to 
raise the United States flag over the city, then part of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of erecting a statue of Fallon, however, aroused strong opposition 
from Latino residents, who make up a quarter of the city's population. They 
called on the city to sponsor public art honoring San Jose's Latino heritage, 
not just its colonial past. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, when city leaders agreed to celebrate Quetzalcoatl (pronounced 
ketz-ul-KWAT-il), fundamentalist Christians began to protest, maintaining that 
the feathered serpent was a bloodthirsty god who demanded human sacrifices of 
his worshipers. They claim that the Aztecs cut out the hearts of adults, 
children and babies in ritual sacrifices to Quetzalcoatl. 
</P>
<P>
 But scholars who have studied the Aztecs, Mayans and other cultures of 
Mesoamerica say the historic record has nothing to indicate that Quetzalcoatl 
was worshiped with offerings of human sacrifice -- unlike other important gods 
of the era. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is a real case of mistaken identity," said Renato Rosaldo, 
chairman of the anthropology department at Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to see their proof," agreed Rosemary Joyce, professor of 
anthropology at UC Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 In the history of Mesoamerica, Quetzalcoatl is a complex figure. 
</P>
<P>
 As far back as 1200 BC, there are signs of the plumed serpent, which 
represented the joining of heaven and earth -- the bird and the snake. Unlike 
Christianity, which sees the serpent as a symbol of evil, the Aztec culture 
considered the feathered snake a symbol of fertility and the earth's renewal 
after the long dry season. 
</P>
<P>
 Quetzalcoatl was associated with the discovery of corn, the invention of 
writing and the discovery of metallurgy. In the great cities of the Aztecs, he 
was the god who brought order to urban spaces. Quetzalcoatl also was the title 
taken by some priests. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs believed that Quetzalcoatl would come back to Earth one day. When 
Spanish conquistador Hernando Cortes arrived in 1519, the Aztecs welcomed him, 
believing he was their returning god. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Spanish invasion, human sacrifice was an important part of Aztec 
culture and represented the ultimate willingness to give oneself to the gods. 
In this, the Aztecs were following the example of their deities, such as the 
god who first caused the sun to rise by leaping into a fire and sacrificing 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 But respected anthropologists agree that there is no evidence linking human 
sacrifice to Quetzalcoatl. Indeed, according to one legend, Quetzalcoatl was 
the name of a great Toltec ruler who argued against the practice of human 
sacrifice and called instead for the sacrifice of flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 For the modern-day descendants of the Aztec, Mayan and Toltec peoples, 
Quetzalcoatl has come to symbolize the advanced civilization that existed long 
before the Spanish conquest. 
</P>
<P>
 As playwright Valdez put it: "Quetzalcoatl is as proud and deep and as ancient 
as the history of America itself. His spirit is embedded in the very earth, in 
the very mountains, in the very plants of this ancient hemisphere." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wearing a cloak against the chill and holding a Bible between her hands as if 
in prayer, Marie Allen walked slowly in circles around the sculpture of 
Quetzalcoatl. To the former Jehovah's Witness, the plumed serpent represents 
Satan. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought I could come here and walk around it like the walls of Jericho," 
she said with a half-smile, "and it would come tumbling down." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, half a dozen Christians huddled on folding chairs, looking every bit 
like campers at a tailgate party, reading the Bible aloud. 
</P>
<P>
 Ed Kelly, a high school Spanish teacher, broke away from the group to explain 
his outrage that Quetzalcoatl would find a place in San Jose, the city named 
after St. Joseph. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a pagan god," Kelly said. "The worship of this god led them to 
unnatural, evil ways of life. To put that statue there is inimical to what I 
think we should be doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the arrival of Quetzalcoatl, a steady stream of people have come to 
downtown San Jose to see for themselves what all the fuss is about. 
</P>
<P>
 Mounted on a circular concrete base, the feathered serpent sits in a large 
traffic island on the south end of Plaza de Cesar Chavez, a park recently 
renamed for the late farm labor leader. 
</P>
<P>
 As a work of art, the sculpture has gotten mediocre reviews from many members 
of the public, who say the dark, stone serpent looks more like a tractor tire 
than an Aztec god. 
</P>
<P>
 Some taxpayers are none too pleased that the city spent $500,000 for the cast 
stone creation -- and did not receive the 25-foot-tall bronze piece originally 
commissioned from Graham for the same price. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's really ugly," said William Eberhardt, a San Jose machinist. "How 
much did they pay for it? Half a million dollars? What a rip-off." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the sculpture has achieved one of its goals: promoting awareness 
of the ancient civilizations of early America. Gathered around Quetzalcoatl, 
total strangers talked with one another about the meaning of the sculpture and 
its place in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally there is going to be some dignity, some respect," said Mike Correa, a 
Chicano businessman from nearby Gilroy. "It's going to bring more recognition 
to Mesoamerica. I love it." 
</P>
<P>
 But Evelyn Martinez, an eighth-generation resident of San Jose, and president 
of Los Fundadores, a group honoring the city's founders, thinks otherwise. "I 
don't think it represents the people of San Jose," she said. "I think they 
would have done better to put up a statue of Cesar Chavez. He did something to 
help the people."

HEART ATTACK KILLS SALVADOR ARCHBISHOP; CENTRAL AMERICA: ARTURO RIVERA DAMAS, 
71, CHAMPIONED CIVIL RIGHTS, JUSTICE. HUNDREDS ATTEND MASS FOR PRELATE WHO 
HELPED TO END CIVIL WAR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Archbishop Arturo Rivera Damas, who led El Salvador's besieged Roman Catholic 
Church through civil war as its priests were assassinated and its parishioners 
persecuted, died Saturday of a heart attack, aides said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 71. 
</P>
<P>
 Often a lone voice of the nation's conscience, Rivera spent much of the last 
decade promoting dialogue between leftist guerrillas and U.S.-backed military 
and government forces, whose war claimed tens of thousands of lives. His 
efforts were ultimately crucial to the signing of peace accords that ended the 
conflict in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 And as the peace agreements faltered in recent months, Rivera spoke out to 
demand political reforms, a fair system of justice and an end to the impunity 
that has allowed some of the war's worst atrocities to go unaccounted for. 
</P>
<P>
 "He died at a critical time, for the church and for the country," Msgr. 
Gregorio Rosa Chavez, the auxiliary bishop of San Salvador and Rivera's 
assistant, said as hundreds of weeping mourners crowded into the Sacred Heart 
Basilica in downtown San Salvador for an open-casket Mass on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosa Chavez said Rivera, who had a history of heart trouble but who seemed in 
good health, had played Ping-Pong on Friday but took ill about 2 a.m. Saturday. 
He suffered a coronary failure at his home and died two hours later at a 
hospital, the prelate's doctor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivera was appointed by Pope John Paul II to take over the church after the 
1980 killing of Msgr. Oscar Arnulfo Romero, who was highly critical of the 
Salvadoran army and the government it backed. Romero was slain by a right-wing 
death squad as he said Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 The new archbishop adopted a less confrontational, more measured style. Where 
Romero was combative, Rivera was a mediator, careful to criticize both sides 
and to urge dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he emerged in the 1980s as a champion of human rights and social 
justice -- notions that often put him and his church at odds with right-wing 
officials who considered such talk to be leftist subversion. 
</P>
<P>
 His condemnation of air force bombings of civilian territories invited death 
threats. He wrote the U.S. Congress to lobby against military aid, and 
chastised then-Vice President George Bush for the Ronald Reagan 
Administration's failure to adequately weigh the influence in El Salvador of a 
brutal right wing. 
</P>
<P>
 The church in El Salvador played a delicate and complicated role during the 
war. Its commitment to working with the poor challenged a status quo where 
power and wealth were concentrated in a few hands and made some priests the 
enemy of the elite. And a number of priests and seminarians crossed the line, 
joining the rebel movement. 
</P>
<P>
 The church itself was divided too, with most bishops more conservative than 
Rivera. He had to walk a fine line to keep the Catholic leadership together and 
to define the church's mission. 
</P>
<P>
 When "to dialogue" with the guerrillas was still considered taboo, Rivera 
called for dialogue. In 1984, he mediated the war's first peace talks in the 
northern Salvadoran town of La Palma. 
</P>
<P>
 Especially after an army platoon killed six Jesuit priests, their cook and her 
daughter at the height of a guerrilla offensive five years ago, Rivera became 
more outspoken. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Jesuits' bloodied bodies lay on the grass where their killers had 
dumped them, and as the government and U.S. officials sought to blame the 
rebels for the slayings, Rivera solemnly sprinkled holy water on the victims 
and proclaimed: "They were killed by the same people who killed Msgr. Romero." 
</P>
<P>
 In the days that followed, threats against Rivera's life were broadcast over 
roving loudspeakers. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Jesuit order, Rivera led the charge to demand that the priests' 
killers be brought to justice -- in contrast to the Romero slaying, where no 
one was ever charged despite the widely held belief that death-squad founder 
Roberto D'Aubuisson ordered the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, two officers were convicted in the Jesuit case and imprisoned. But 
they were later released in a government amnesty. 
</P>
<P>
 "His work is immense, and all we could say about him would fall short, but he 
was the greatest defender of human rights," Maria Julia Hernandez, head of the 
Catholic Church's human rights office, Tutela Legal, said of Rivera on 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 To the end, Rivera criticized the failure of the Salvadoran system to name 
Romero's killers. 
</P>
<P>
 In presidential elections last March, he took the unusual and controversial 
step of publicly discouraging parishioners from voting for the ruling 
Nationalist Republican Alliance party, founded in the early 1980s by 
D'Aubuisson and other reputed death-squad leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The right-wing party's presidential candidate, Armando Calderon Sol, won 
anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivera continued the tradition started by Romero of using his Sunday homily to 
comment on the week's political events, denounce war abuses and plead for 
peace. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 12-year conflict, when there was no opposition press, the homilies 
were often the only source of information and the only public voice of dissent. 
</P>
<P>
 In his final such appearance last Sunday, Rivera sounded a pessimistic note 
upon returning from a three-week tour of the Salvadoran countryside and amid 
concerns that some elements of the peace accords are unraveling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find a country on the brink of desperation and disillusionment," he said. 
"To succumb to that temptation would be to reopen the door to the use of force 
as the solution. For that reason, it seems fundamental to me that the truth be 
sincerely sought. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Truth and justice are the unsubstitutable pillars of peace," the archbishop 
said. "But it seems there are still some among us who would build peace on the 
illusion of lies and injustice."

YELTSIN VOWS TO TAKE OFFENSIVE ON SLUMPING ECONOMY; RUSSIA: PRESIDENT SEEKS 
SUPPORT OUTSIDE PARLIAMENT FOR HIS 1995 BUDGET, WHICH MANY LAWMAKERS OPPOSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly three years after launching free-market reforms, President Boris N. 
Yeltsin admitted Saturday that Russia's economy is still in decline, but he 
vowed a bolder attack on inflation with or without Parliament's support. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are close to overcoming the crisis," Yeltsin told more than 600 political 
and business leaders summoned to the Kremlin. "In 1995, we will take the 
offensive. We will achieve financial stabilization and move on to creating 
conditions for economic revival." 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's address and the one-day assembly itself, which he orchestrated, 
meant more as a challenge to the conservative-led Parliament than as a clear 
blueprint of how to achieve his aims. He indicated that he would ignore 
lawmakers if they continued to oppose a tight 1995 budget like the one his 
government has submitted. 
</P>
<P>
 The event was one of the president's increasingly rare initiatives in support 
of Western-style economic reform, and it came after his commitment to that 
ideal had been thrown into question by a messy, monthlong turnover of his 
entire economic team. 
</P>
<P>
 Since his historic decision in January, 1992, to free most prices, Yeltsin has 
had five finance ministers, three central bank presidents, six Cabinet 
shake-ups and ongoing internal struggles over the reform policies pursued in 
his name. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest personnel changes, which again left the Cabinet split between 
reformers and reform resisters, were prompted by a one-day drop of 25% in the 
ruble's value Oct. 11 and the government's narrow defeat of a parliamentary 
vote of no confidence two weeks later. 
</P>
<P>
 The current Parliament, elected last December after Yeltsin shut down the old 
one in a bloody showdown over reforms, went along passively with the 
government's 1994 budget early this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But its lower house, the Duma, voted 227-57 on Friday to reject the proposed 
1995 budget as unrealistic, challenging the government on its top economic 
priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin said Saturday that he is ready for "reasonable compromise" with the 
Duma but warned against "irresponsible populist solutions" that would revive 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Duma Chairman Ivan B. Rybkin, speaking at the Kremlin gathering, outlined the 
battle ahead. He said the government proposes too big a tax burden on 
individuals and not enough subsidies for Russian producers and exporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We cannot backtrack on the road to reform," he said. "But this does not mean 
there are no alternative ways to get there . . . or that the social costs of 
large-scale transformations should not be discussed." 
</P>
<P>
 The government, which collected just half its expected tax revenue this year 
and had to slash spending, now proposes to cover a projected $22-billion gap 
between 1995 income and revenue by borrowing abroad and selling Russian bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, the central bank would be barred from printing rubles to 
cover any shortfall. This, according to government calculations, would bring 
inflation down to 2% or less per month by mid-1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices in Russia are expected to triple this year, an improvement over last 
year's ninefold increase, but production is shrinking with no forecast of 
growth before 1996. Short of credit and indebted to each other, thousands of 
enterprises are paralyzed. 
</P>
<P>
 And the government appears divided over how to shape the free market. 
</P>
<P>
 Anatoly B. Chubais, the former privatization chief now in charge of the 
overall economy, is the only surviving young radical from the reform team of 
1992. Yevgeny Yasin, the new economy minister, is 60 years old and somewhat 
more moderate. Finance Minister Vladimir Panskov, who spent time in jail last 
year on unproven charges of bribe-taking, is a Soviet-era technocrat. All are 
personally loyal to Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
 The government is under criticism from conservative lawmakers for pushing a 
tight-money strategy and from liberal ones for failing to undertake planned 
reforms of the armed forces and the state collective farms -- bureaucratic 
monsters that eat up much of the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been taking this medicine for three years. Now they are suggesting that 
we continue taking it for a fourth year and some deity will throw a switch that 
will suddenly boost our production," Mikhail Zadornov, chairman of the Duma 
budget committee, said before Friday's vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeking to sidestep Parliament, Yeltsin invited industrialists and bankers -- 
"the people organizing our new economic life," he called them -- to join 
regional governors and moderate lawmakers at Saturday's assembly. He also 
handpicked the 14 speakers, who generally endorsed his austerity message. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-hour session reminded some participants of the Communist Party 
Central Committee meetings held in the same Marbled Hall of the Kremlin before 
the Soviet Union collapsed. Sergei Y. Glazyev, a leading opposition economist 
with a comprehensive reform plan of his own, was denied permission to speak. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is clear that Parliament will never approve the 1995 budget, so the 
president is enlisting support in other circles," said Nikolai I. Travkin, a 
member of the Cabinet and the Duma. "I am sure he will put this support to good 
use, to give legitimacy to some actions that the Duma won't go along with."

ASSAULT IN CHECHNYA FAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A major offensive by the Russian-backed opposition Saturday failed to wrest 
Grozny, the capital of the breakaway region of Chechnya, from government 
control. 
</P>
<P>
 The presidential palace, which the opposition had claimed to seize earlier 
Saturday, was swarming with government officials and heavily armed supporters 
of President Dzhokhar Dudayev. 
</P>
<P>
 The government said the opposition fighters were mostly Russians and that 300 
of the 350 opposition soldiers killed were Russian. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview, Dudayev vowed to continue fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Russia continues this path, we have no other option," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Claims of Russian involvement in the fighting could not be verified 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 Chechnya, a mostly Muslim area of 1.2 million in the Caucasus Mountains, 
declared independence in 1991. Dudayev loyalists say Moscow wants to oust the 
former Soviet air force general so Chechnya will return to the Kremlin's fold. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow, which backs the opposition politically and reportedly gives financial 
support, has denied providing any military help.

GRENADE KILLS 2 AT SUNNI MOSQUE IN PAKISTANI CITY

<P>
 Masked motorcyclists hurled a grenade into a Sunni Muslim mosque in the 
Pakistani city of Lahore on Saturday, killing two worshipers and wounding 20, 
police and hospital sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The violence followed a bus attack Friday in which seven Shiite Muslims were 
killed and 14 wounded near Jhelum in Punjab province. No group has claimed 
responsibility, but Shiites have blamed the militant Sunni Sipah-i-Sahaba for 
the night ambush. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate attack Saturday, gunmen ambushed a bus at Farooqabad, killing 
one Shiite Muslim and wounding several others, police said.

POPE PRAISES COURAGE AT CEREMONY FOR CARDINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clergymen who will help select the next pontiff knelt before Pope John Paul II 
on Saturday to receive the red hat of cardinal and hear praise for what some 
have endured: gulag prison camps and bloodshed in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Rome, you have the history of the early Christian martyrs. Today, you had 
some living martyrs," said one of the 30 new cardinals, Archbishop William H. 
Keeler, 63, of Baltimore. Another American elevated to cardinal was Detroit 
Archbishop Adam J. Maida, 64. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the new cardinals are struggling to rebuild their lives and the Roman 
Catholic Church after decades of persecution in former authoritarian regimes 
such as Albania and the Soviet Union. Others traveled to the Vatican from 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, Cuba, Africa and Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 The group represents 24 nations, reflecting the Pope's goal of expanding the 
international character of the College of Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 It also broadens John Paul's imprint on the conclave. During his 16-year 
papacy, he has named 100 of the 120 cardinals under 80 years old and eligible 
to vote for Pope, many of whom may share his conservative views on issues such 
as birth control and the ban on women priests. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Pope read the list of the new cardinals -- first announced Oct. 30 -- 
the 6,000 people in the main Vatican auditorium applauded. The ovation grew 
when he reached the names of those once jailed in the Soviet Bloc, Cuba and 
Vietnam. Many people rose to their feet when the Pope announced Vinko Puljic, 
the archbishop of Sarajevo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am thinking in particular of the Christians of Sarajevo and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina," the 74-year-old pontiff said. "The devastating roar of 
weapons has not yet ceased, and so much innocent blood continues to be shed 
without any prospect for peace in sight." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pope, who confronted the Communist regime in his native Poland, took 
special note of others who have "had to endure the oppression of an atheistic 
totalitarian regime." 
</P>
<P>
 One new cardinal, Archbishop Kazimierz Swiatek of Minsk, Belarus, spent nearly 
10 years in Soviet prisons. The archbishop of Prague, Miloslav Vlk, was 
harassed by secret police under the Communists and washed windows for a living. 
Archbishop Jaime Lucas Ortega y Alamino of Cuba spent a year in a labor camp in 
the mid-1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Joseph Pham Dinh Tung, the archbishop of Hanoi, was put under house 
arrest by Vietnamese Communist rulers from 1963 to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 The others knelt before the Pope and were given the three-cornered red hats 
that signify the position. They will receive their rings today.

TRUCE VIOLATION DISCOUNTED IN ANGOLA COPTER DOWNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The government accused UNITA rebels Saturday of shooting down an army 
helicopter and killing 22 soldiers on board, but said it was not a major 
violation of the current truce. 
</P>
<P>
 The official Jornal de Angola newspaper said the helicopter was downed Friday 
in southeastern Cuando-Cubango province while carrying sick and wounded 
soldiers.An accompanying editorial indicated that the government did not 
consider it a major incident. 
</P>
<P>
 A UNITA spokesman said the helicopter might have been hit accidentally by 
rebel fire but insisted it was not an intentional violation of a peace treaty 
signed last Sunday to end Angola's 19-year war. 
</P>
<P>
 After signing the treaty in Lusaka, Zambia, the government and UNITA, the 
National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, declared a truce Tuesday 
to end fighting that has killed 500,000 Angolans since war erupted on the eve 
of independence from Portugal in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 The cease-fire has generally held. Negotiations on a power-sharing agreement 
are to intensify this week when rebel leaders are expected to return to the 
capital for the first time in two years.

LEFTIST GROUP STANDS GOOD CHANCE IN URUGUAY VOTE; POLITICS: PRESIDENT TO BE 
ELECTED TODAY. NATION'S TWO TRADITIONAL PARTIES CHALLENGED FOR FIRST TIME BY 
SOCIALIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM R. LONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Uruguayans elect a new president today, and the chance that a socialist could 
win has injected extra excitement into the race. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the first time in Uruguayan history that a leftist coalition has 
seriously challenged the country's two traditional parties for national power. 
Pollsters and commentators say the three-way presidential contest is too close 
to call. 
</P>
<P>
 The socialist candidate is Tabare Vazquez, a physician and former mayor of 
Montevideo whose Broad Front coalition includes Communists and former 
guerrillas. 
</P>
<P>
 Other leading candidates are lawyer Alberto Volonte of the governing Blanco 
(White) Party and former President Julio Sanguinetti of the Colorado (Red) 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent political polls put all three parties within a few percentage points of 
one another. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey published last week by the Vox polling firm, for example, gave the 
Blancos 28% of the voter preference, the Colorados 27.9% and Vazquez's 
coalition 25.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 20 presidential candidates are running. Uruguayan law allows more 
than one presidential candidate from each party or coalition; the top-placing 
candidate of the party or coalition that draws the most votes wins the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Volonte is a former president of the national electric company. Another Blanco 
candidate is Sen. Juan Ramirez, who was interior minister under President Luis 
Alberto Lacalle. Lacalle is constitutionally barred from immediate reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanguinetti, who was president from 1985-1990, is the overwhelming favorite 
among Colorado candidates. Far behind him, according to polls, is another 
former Colorado president, Jorge Pacheco Areco. 
</P>
<P>
 Uruguay, a country of 3.2 million people, was known as Latin America's most 
advanced welfare state for much of this century. But beginning in the 1960s, 
the national economy declined as government deficits and inflation soared. The 
country's traditional democracy was shaken by guerrilla violence in the early 
1970s, then interrupted by a decade of harsh military dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Sanguinetti and Lacalle have presided over moderate economic growth 
and some progress in taming unruly inflation, they have failed to bring back 
what nostalgic Uruguayans remember as the golden years of the 1940s and 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 Many voters see Lacalle's market reform policies as a threat to the 
traditional welfare state. In a 1992 plebiscite, for example, voters 
overwhelmingly rejected a government-backed proposal to privatize the state

 Sanguinetti, who opposed the privatization, was leading in the polls by a wide

began gaining popularity, propelled by his congenial campaign style and his 
reputation as an efficient administrator.

 Vazquez's appeal is based on disappointment in Colorado and Blanco 
administrations and on the popularity of the welfare-state tradition, analysts 
say. But they also say radical Marxist influence in the leftist coalition is a

SLAIN OFFICERS REMEMBERED AS HEROES IN WAR ON CRIME; MEMORIAL: HUNDREDS ATTEND 
SEPARATE SERVICES FOR TWO OF THE THREE INVESTIGATORS KILLED LAST WEEK AT D.C. 
POLICE HEADQUARTERS.

 In a somber processional, hundreds of police cars, their blue lights flashing, 
coiled past the capital's monuments Saturday after two fallen law enforcement 
officers were memorialized as heroes in the "war against evil." 
</P>
<P>
 The caravan rolled past the Washington Monument within sight of the White 
House and circled police headquarters, where a Washington homicide sergeant and 
two FBI agents were fatally shot Tuesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 A mile-and-a-half long, the motorcade paralyzed traffic as it accompanied the 
body of Police Sgt. Henry Joseph Daly to Arlington National Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 Memorial services were held in Virginia for Daly, 51, and in Maryland for 
slain FBI Agent Michael John Miller, 41. Also remembered Saturday was a third 
slain officer, FBI Agent Martha Dixon Martinez, 35, who will be buried near 
Pittsburgh, Pa., on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank God for Michael, Martha and Hank, who were willing to serve," FBI 
Director Louis J. Freeh said at Miller's service. 
</P>
<P>
 The three officers were shot when 25-year-old Bennie Lee Lawson walked into 
the third-floor offices used by the "cold case" homicide squad and opened fire 
with a compact assault-style firearm, police said. Two other people were 
wounded. Lawson also died in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 The slayings inside the supposedly safe environment of the police department 
shocked the city known as the nation's murder capital for the past five years 
and prompted an outpouring of fellow officers from numerous jurisdictions. 
</P>
<P>
 As the crowd grew outside St. Phillip's Church in Falls Church, Va., where 
Daly's funeral Mass was held, a bystander commented: "There is no single church 
large enough for this." 
</P>
<P>
 The church was filled. An honor guard of more than 100 remained outside during 
the ceremony. A spillover crowd of hundreds more watched a television relay at 
Falls Church High School. 
</P>
<P>
 In St. Phillip's, the chaplain of the District of Columbia Metropolitan Police 
Department, Rev. Salvatore Criscuolo, said the shootings raise questions 
answerable only by God: "How could this happen? What is this city coming to?" 
</P>
<P>
 He focused on the character of the fallen officer, a 28-year veteran who for 
the past 13 years has been a member of the homicide division, supervising its 
"cold case" squad since its creation in 1991. The squad investigates murder 
cases that have long since grown "cold" from lack of progress. 
</P>
<P>
 D.C. Police Chief Fred Thomas said Daly "would want us all to continue this 
war against evil." 
</P>
<P>
 In Maryland, it was standing room only at the Village Baptist Church, where 
Miller's body lay, and at the equally crowded Catholic church next door, where 
an overflow crowd watched the service via closed-circuit television. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was for freedom from violence, representing the hopes and dreams of all of 
us -- to be safe and free," Freeh said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, who recently married a fellow FBI agent, Jorge Martinez, was 
remembered by Freeh on Friday when he said: "She chose to work in the most 
difficult area of law enforcement, to work on the most frustrating cases, but 
yet the cases that had the most impact." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly's brother, Michael, a lieutenant in the Metro transit police, looked over 
the officers seated row on row in blue and brown and gray uniforms in Virginia, 
their badges -- each bisected with a black ribbon -- gleaming in the light from 
the windows. 
</P>
<P>
 "When a policeman dies, it is clear that while he has his own family and 
friends, he also has an extended family of all of those who carry a badge and a 
gun," he said.

VOTERS RATE THE COVERAGE BY NEWS MEDIA AS MEDIOCRE; SURVEY: MORE THAN HALF GAVE 
THE PRESS A GRADE OF C OR BELOW FOR ITS CAMPAIGN REPORTING. ELECTION DAY 
POLLING WAS CONDUCTED FOR TIMES MIRROR CENTER.

 Washington politicians weren't the only victims of voter disgust this year. 
The country's news media also got a less-than-encouraging report card for 
campaign coverage, exit polling showed. 
</P>
<P>
 In exit polls conducted for the Times Mirror Center for The People & The 
Press, 59% of those surveyed gave the press a grade of C or below for coverage 
of the midterm congressional and gubernatorial races. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 38% said the news media deserved an A or B for good to excellent 
coverage. Respondents were asked to grade the press for coverage of Senate, 
House and gubernatorial races. 
</P>
<P>
 The results were based on interviews with 20,000 people leaving their polling 
places. 
</P>
<P>
 The average in 12 states surveyed was a C for coverage of the campaign that 
resulted in a Republican takeover of the Congress and significant GOP gains in 
governors' races. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the states surveyed reached a B grade overall for the press. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight percent of those polled gave the press an F overall, while 7% gave the 
news media an A. 
</P>
<P>
 The voter view of the news media seemed tied to the electorate's turn to the 
right and to the Republican Party. Those who voted Republican had a more 
negative view of the press than those who voted Democratic. 
</P>
<P>
 White males, whose swing to the GOP this year contributed significantly to 
putting Congress in Republican hands, gave the press failing grades more often 
-- 12% of the time -- than white females or black men and women, who gave the 
news media an F 6% of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Whites in general were more critical, with only 28% giving the press grades of 
good to excellent, compared with 46% among blacks and 62% among Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Regionally, the press got somewhat better grades in the South and West than in 
the East and Midwest, according to the exit polling. 
</P>
<P>
 The only state of 12 surveyed where more than half the voters, 56%, said the 
media did a good or excellent job was Massachusetts. Respondents rated the 
coverage of the Senate race between Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, who was reelected, 
and Republican challenger Mitt Romney. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters polled in California, where Sen. Dianne Feinstein narrowly won over 
Republican Rep. Mike Huffington after engaging in a nasty battle for the 
Senate, gave press coverage a C-minus. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia voters, who reelected Sen. Charles S. Robb over Republican Oliver L. 
North, rated coverage a C overall. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other states that showed particularly low press ratings were Michigan and 
Pennsylvania, where supporters of GOP Senate candidates Spencer Abraham and 
Rick Santorum were especially critical. 
</P>
<P>
 As much as anything, people interviewed by pollsters were "voting against the 
press," said Andrew Kohut, director of the Times Mirror Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even among the Democrats and liberal groups of people, they weren't ecstatic 
about the press," he said. "People value the watchdog role the press plays, but 
they think the watchdog goes a little berserk sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 The poll, by Mitofsky International, focused on coverage of the gubernatorial 
races in Arizona, Connecticut, Florida, Maryland, New York and Texas, and the 
Senate races in California, Massachusetts, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Jersey 
and Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 It also questioned voters on coverage of the House contests in those 12 
states.

USAIR CRASH PROMPTS STUDY OF RUDDER SYSTEM ON 737S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The rudder control system used on all Boeing 737 jets is under federal study 
to see if there is any need for it to be redesigned. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Aviation Administration review was prompted in part by the 
September crash of a USAir 737 near Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're actually reviewing the systems from top to bottom," FAA spokesman David 
Duff told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts from other federal agencies and the FAA's Canadian counterpart are 
taking part, according to FAA Associate Administrator Anthony J. Broderick. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeing Co. spokeswoman Liz Verdier said the company considers "a fresh look at 
the design" of the plane to be helpful. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the initial investigation of the Pittsburgh crash has not found 
evidence to suggest that any single component failed and that the review will 
cover "anything that commands flight control: wings, rudder, horizontal 
stabilizers, elevators. Anything that controls the flight characteristics of 
the airplane." 
</P>
<P>
 The study is separate from the National Transportation Safety Board's 
investigation of the USAir crash itself. On Sept. 8, a USAir 737-300 rolled to 
the left and plunged about 6,000 feet into a wooded hillside, killing all 132 
people on board. 
</P>
<P>
 Malfunctioning rudders, the vertical part of an airplane's tail that turns the 
craft left or right, have never been established as the cause of a 737 crash.

21ST KEVORKIAN-ASSISTED SUICIDE IS DECLARED A HOMICIDE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jack Kevorkian was present Saturday at the carbon monoxide death of an ailing 
72-year-old woman, the 21st death the advocate of assisted suicide has attended 
since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities ruled the death of Margaret Garrish a homicide.She died at her 
home in Royal Oak, the Detroit suburb where Kevorkian used to live. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevorkian lawyer Michael Schwartz said in a statement that the doctor was 
present when Garrish "chose to end her suffering by mercifully ending her own 
life at her home." It was the first death involving Kevorkian in more than a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Garrish's husband of 50 years, William, and two of her three sons were also 
present, Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Michigan law temporarily banning assisted suicides, passed to stop 
Kevorkian, may have expired Friday. Interpretations of the law's expiration 
date differ. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevorkian, a retired pathologist, had been counseling Garrish for two years, 
Schwartz said. She had rheumatoid arthritis, colonic diverticulitis, 
osteoporosis and other ailments. Both legs had been amputated and she had lost 
one eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland County medical examiner Ljubisa Dragovic said Garrish died of carbon 
monoxide poisoning. He said he ruled it a homicide because he thought another 
person would have had to introduce the poison to her. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevorkian supplied Garrish with the canister of carbon monoxide, tubing and 
other equipment, Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal Oak police said Saturday that they hadn't questioned Kevorkian and 
expected their investigation to continue through Monday. Oakland County 
Prosecutor Richard Thompson said he wouldn't comment until police finish 
investigating. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz said he didn't know where Kevorkian was. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Dennie, a neighbor of the Garrish family, said Garrish "was in a lot 
of pain. She finally did get help for her pain from her doctor. She couldn't 
hold anything; she couldn't take care of herself."

NICOLE SIMPSON'S FAMILY ATTEND SHELTER FUND-RAISER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Slowly emerging from their seclusion, the family of Nicole Brown Simpson made 
a brief appearance Saturday night at a charity ball to raise awareness about 
domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of aiding abused women "is something that is a current topic," said 
Lou Brown, Nicole Simpson's father."And we are here to let you know we believe 
in it and the family supports it in every way. And that's all we have to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown read his brief statement during a press reception at a black-tie 
fund-raiser for the Interval House Crisis Shelters, which has four facilities 
in Orange County. He declined to answer questions as the family was escorted to 
the hotel's main ballroom. Brown was accompanied by his wife, Judy, daughters 
Tanya and Dominique and two bodyguards. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual event was expected to raise $150,000 for the shelters, which 
provide emergency housing and counseling for victims of domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Brown Simpson's older sister, Denise Brown, did not attend the event, 
but has spoken several times recently about her interest in helping victims of 
domestic violence, and about an evolution in her views of her sister's marriage 
to murder suspect O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I realize that Nicole was a battered woman, something I never knew 
before," she Brown said in a recent interview with The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The change in her thinking, Denise Brown said, came after she and other family 
members discovered notes among Nicole's belongings that described apparent 
incidents of abuse. Denise Brown would not elaborate on their contents.

HOTEL FETE FOR WOMAN, 99, FULFILLS DREAM DEFERRED BY 1906 QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Helen Huntington Perrin celebrated her 99th birthday in the Fairmont Hotel on 
Saturday, fulfilling a dream she thought had ended when the 1906 earthquake 
destroyed the interior of the Nob Hill landmark. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, Pliny C. Huntington, was to have been the general manager of the 
hotel in 1906, its inaugural year.The position disappeared when the quake 
struck, pushing back the opening a full year. 
</P>
<P>
 Perrin, who was 11 in 1906, dreamed of spending her childhood in the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "She just knew that she'd be meeting all sorts of famous people from all 
over," her daughter Martha Williams, 63, told the Contra Costa Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Ownership of the hotel changed after the earthquake and Perrin's father did 
not get the job. 
</P>
<P>
 His daughter celebrated her birthday with family and friends, and the hotel 
hosted a birthday dinner, complete with a cake topped with 99 candles. 
</P>
<P>
 Perrin, of Rossmoor, paid the turn-of-the-century rates of $10 for a suite, 30 
cents for breakfast, 45 cents for lunch and $1.30 for dinner. The suite rate 
today is $750. Her family paid $2.50 for their rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's overwhelming," said Perrin. "It just floors you." 
</P>
<P>
 The hotel was approached by Williams, who told officials how her mother almost 
lived in the Fairmont. "We told them that we could not afford a whole lot, but 
we would just love to honor her and give her this nice gift of staying there," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perrin slept in a nicer bed than the one she was in when the quake struck her 
San Francisco home in 1906. That was a Murphy bed that folded up into the wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It started to fold up," she recalled. "It finally did start to go down, and, 
believe me, I got out of that bed in a hurry."

TRW, LOCKHEED: HIGH-TECH HELP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 TRW Inc. and Lockheed Corp., which built some of the nation's most capable spy 
satellites during the Cold War, are trying to apply that same technology to 
help clean up radioactive waste left from the nuclear arms race. 
</P>
<P>
 The work is part of a broad effort by the Energy Department to use advanced 
technology to cut the staggering cost of cleaning thousands of contaminated 
sites across the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 A Lockheed computer chip crucial to radar-imaging satellites may allow a 
breakthrough in increasing the rate at which contaminated soil can be 
processed, company officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lockheed work is under way at the Idaho National Engineering Laboratory, a 
huge nuclear weapons facility where the Energy Department buried 6 million 
cubic feet of plutonium from the 1950s until the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 The plutonium and other radioactive elements were packaged in steel barrels 
and placed in shallow pits, where the drums quickly corroded and released large 
amounts of radioactivity into the soil. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleaning the mess is costly, complex and slow. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottleneck, ironically, is not the pace at which the soil can be cleaned 
through acid leaching or other processes, but the time it takes to measure the 
radioactivity in the dirt before and after the cleanup, said Lockheed vice 
president Steve Winston. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, germanium sensors -- much like Geiger counters -- were used to 
monitor the radioactivity, but the time needed to take a reading limited the 
processing of soil to about one ton per hour. The satellite chip, however, 
allows arrays of up to 10 germanium sensors to operate as much as 100 times 
more quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Winston is hoping that Lockheed will allow soil to be cleaned at a rate of 100 
tons per hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, TRW's unit in San Bernardino is using some of its software 
developed for interpreting spy satellite photos in the Energy Department's 
massive cleanup job. 
</P>
<P>
 The software allows a series of overhead photographs to be manipulated so that 
an intelligence analyst can see a ground-level view of a scene, a big help in 
interpreting the purpose of secret facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The process involves sending camera-carrying robots into buildings that are so 
highly contaminated that workers -- even in protective gear -- would exceed 
their allowable lifetime limits of radiation in minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, the blueprints for former bomb plants have been lost and nobody 
is even sure what is inside these contaminated structures, said Daniel G. 
Culver, TRW's managing director for operations and projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "The beauty of this (system) is that you can use a joystick and get virtual 
imaging," Culver said. "You can scan down through the ceiling, see all the 
piping, wiring and things you wouldn't even get from an engineering drawing." 
</P>
<P>
 TRW is hoping diversification into the environmental, medical information and 
commercial space industries will preserve about 300 jobs in San Bernardino that 
otherwise would be lost by next year, Culver said.

MIKE PENNER: IT'S TIME FOR RAM FANS TO DO A LITTLE COURTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Denial is in the air, hazy and ominous. 
</P>
<P>
 Denial from Anaheim -- No, John Shaw insists, 40% of the Rams have not been 
sold to St. Louis businessman Stan Kroenke, the first step in relocating 100% 
of the Ram franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 Denial from St. Louis -- Any report of a 40% purchase of the Rams by Kroenke 
would be "premature," according to a lawyer who represents Kroenke. 
</P>
<P>
 Two words, Ram fans. 
</P>
<P>
 They're gone. 
</P>
<P>
 This much we know about sports negotiations of any kind, be they the trading 
of a first-string linebacker or the dissolution of a 50-year Southern 
California institution: When the suits and the stuffed shirts start saying "no" 
for the record, the off-the-record reply -- i.e., the truth -- is always "yes." 
</P>
<P>
 (The reverse is also true. Media: "So, regardless of what else may transpire 
between now and then, if Trent Dilfer is still on the board at No. 5, you're 
going to take him?" Chuck Knox: "Yes. You have my word.") 
</P>
<P>
 So we might as well get used to the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Rich Rams of St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Backlit Jerome Bettis photo shoots under the Arch. 
</P>

 Weekly Jimmy Johnson press briefings at Tony's. 
</P>
<P>

Station. 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, the annual Post-Dispatch Rams-Chiefs exhibition charity 
classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Freed from our emotional attachments to the third-and-one plunge for no gain 
and the three-man quarterbacking rotation, we can now look to the future with 
an uncluttered head and scrap Save The Rams for a more practical, pragmatic 
concept in grass-roots fan coalitions: 
</P>
<P>
 Replace The Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 It is never too early to begin plotting an insidious franchise grab, as the 
St. Louis and Baltimore experiences have shown. St. Louis lost the football 
Cardinals after the 1987 season and are only now getting around to naming a 
successor, seven long years later. Baltimore lost the Colts in 1984 and had to 
wait 10 years for a substitute -- the CFL Don't Call Us The Colts, also known 
as the CFL Baltimore Franchise, also known as The Horse With No Name. 
</P>
<P>
 Time is crucial, because with no Rams, no Angels, no Ducks, no Cal State 
Fullerton football and no Pigskin Classic, autumn in Orange County is beginning 
to look a lot like autumn in Needles. 
</P>
<P>
 So, who's out there? 
</P>
<P>
 Who do we want? 
</P>
<P>
 The Buccaneers are in play. True, they have Dilfer and a head coach who says 
things actually worth printing in the newspaper, but the Bucs are undisputed 
kings of the 5-11 season. There's been too much of that around here lately. No 
sense replacing the West Coast Branch Buccaneers with the sad-sack original -- 
and besides, when the Rams leave for St. Louis, the Buccaneers are the 
consolation prize. Peter Angelos already has dibs. 
</P>
<P>
 In Seattle, attendance is dwindling and the Seahawks are said to be getting 
itchy. Thanks, no thanks. We know all about Seattle. Curt Warner, Chuck Knox, 
Chick Harris, George Dyer -- the only thing that has ever really translated 
down here is Starbuck's. 
</P>
<P>
 A great rumor starting to make the rounds has the Cardinals moving west again 
to fill the void should the Rams and the Raiders vacate the Los Angeles market. 
Beautiful. St. Louis, which lost the Cardinals, gets the Rams, and L.A., which 
lost the Rams, gets the Cardinals. A straight-up, one-for-one NFL franchise 
swap, with Phoenix serving as middle man. 
</P>
<P>
 Buddy Ryan finally makes it to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals have their drawbacks, of course. No playoffs in a non-strike 
season since 1975. No winning record since 1984. Jay Schroeder. Larry Centers. 
Bill Bidwill. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County has seen this act before. It is tired of losers. It is sick of 
bottomless rebuilding programs. It wants a football team with a past -- a few 
championship banners to run up the flagpoles would be nice -- and a football 
team with a present. 
</P>
<P>
 Some team winning right now. 
</P>
<P>
 Some team contending for the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some team flashier than the Rams, but more conservative than the 49ers. Steve 
Young to Jerry Rice 16 times a game -- that isn't Orange County's style. 
Neither is Tony Zendejas four times a game, though Chuck Knox, obviously, was 
never notified. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's next football team should be able to win its division every so 
often, win at home, average three touchdowns a game, play some defense . . . 
even wear orange helmets, if we're to get greedy here. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's next football team should be, yes, the Cleveland Browns. 
</P>
<P>
 We get all our football teams from Cleveland. In '46, we swindled the 
Cleveland Rams west. That's almost 50 years ago. Cleveland replaced the Rams 
with the Browns in '50 and has enjoyed mostly successful, totally uninterrupted 
professional football for 45 years. 
</P>
<P>
 That's long enough. 
</P>
<P>
 It is time to trade up, Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Modell, a football owner who knows football, and, more importantly, knows 
football fans . . . or Georgia Frontiere? 
</P>
<P>
 A tangy Mark Rypien-Vinny Testaverde quarterback debate . . . or Chris 
Miller's knee-Chris Chandler's ankle-Tommy Maddox's arm hitch? 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Metcalf . . . or David Lang? 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Belichick . . . OK, so no deal is perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 If Leigh Steinberg and the Save The Rams button-wearers want to spend some 
quality time scheduling meetings, Modell is the man they ought to be ringing, 
not Shaw. So the Browns are entrenched as a way of life in Cleveland. So were 
the Colts in Baltimore. So were the Rams, once upon a time, in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Professional football is a cold business. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that we've had a refresher course on the ground rules, let the wining, 
dining and snaking begin. Unless Orange County wants to sample the NFL the way 
it does the NBA. Maybe the Chargers can be talked into shipping a home game or 
two up here each year.

 The second quarter opened on a bad note. The USC halfback ran through the 
Notre Dame defense. USC took a 7-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," says McClanahan the expert on everything, "What'd ye expect?! 
Haythens, the lot o' them! What is it they call themselves, 'the Mongols'?" 
</P>
<P>
 "The Trojans!" snaps McGonigle the publican, irritated. "They call themselves 
Trojans. Don't ye know anything?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," says McClanahan, "I knew it was some kind of pagan horde. Cossacks! 
They have no regard for human daycency, at all!" 
</P>
<P>
 "I know," sighs Clancy the undertaker. "And our lads out there with the grace 
o' God purring in their hearts and the light of saints in their eyes. Didn't we 
light a candle for this game only last Saturday?" 
</P>
<P>
 "And gave up potatoes for Lent!" shouts Houlihan, the doorman at the Hilton. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hennessy-Tennesy'll not tootle the flute this night!" roars Carmody the night 
clerk. "Nobody feels like singing!" 
</P>
<P>
 "The overalls are in the chowder," agrees McClanahan gloomily. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the officials," announces Flanagan the cop. "Protestants, the lot o' 
them!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Republicans, even," agrees O'Connor the night clerk. "Not a workingman in the 
lot!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Usen't we to beat these people?" complains Daly the bill collector. 
</P>
<P>
 "51-0 one year!" crows Kelly the night watchman. "Ah, ye should have been 
there! 'Twas the Battle of the Boyne all over again!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Their coach looks a fair enough fellow," comments O'Grady the criminal 
lawyer, spotting USC's John Robinson on the sideline. "A round fellow. He looks 
a fellow you could trust. He looks a priest." 
</P>
<P>
 "Bite yer tongue! Hold yer blasphemy!" snarls McGillicuddy the unemployed 
woodworker. "His heart is as black as an English king's! He'd win by a hundred 
if he could. We'd get no mercy from the likes o' him. Cromwell probably looked 
like that." 
</P>
<P>
 "Cromwell bayonetted babies," notes Corrigan the flagman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, look at that!" says McGonigle, rising in his seat as Notre Dame gets the 
ball and the lead, 10-7. 
</P>
<P>
 "The saints be praised!" cries Garvey the paperhanger. "Can we have a bit of a 
tune? Cheer, cheer fer auld Nowter Deem, eh?! Did somebody go out for a pint? 
Oh, the woonder of it all! God's heard us!" 
</P>
<P>
 "A chorus o' 'McNamara's Band' might not be amiss!" glows Milligan the 
undertaker. "Galway Bay!" 
</P>
<P>
 "That's for later!" glowers Horan the pessimist. "'Tis not over yet! The 
haythens may get the ball yet!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Are they all nine feet tall?" complains Quinn the parliamentarian. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the sun," explains Costello the anthropologist. "Even their flowers are 
big out here. Their tomatoes look like pumpkins." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Irish used to be bigger," insists Corwin the pants-presser. "Gipp was 
bigger." 
</P>
<P>
 "And the ball heavier in his day! Don't forget that!" says Noonan the chimney 
sweep. "There was heavy liftin' back then." 
</P>
<P>
 "Gipp was a Protestant," puts in McDonough the sourpuss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not when it came to the dyin'!" shouts Ratigan the theologian. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rockne changed over!" cries Eddington the collector. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had to. He saw the effect of prayer in the Army game," explains Hennessy 
the nurseryman. 
</P>
<P>
 "He invented the forward pass!" shouts Tumulty the crossing guard. "We'll all 
have a drink to Rockne now!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Rockne used to beat these people, 27-0," glooms Gavin the pessimist. 
</P>
<P>
 "More than that even!" cries O'Donnell the statistician. "Rockne never lost to 
them!" 
</P>
<P>
 "You saw the fillum then! The one where Paddy O'Brien played Rockne. Or was 
that Mr. Reagan?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Reagan played Gipp, ye great dummy!" growls McDonough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the fillum 14 times by count!" boasts Haggerty the critic. "The 
cinema's finest hour!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Whisht! Be quiet!" shouts Dolan the clock-maker as Notre Dame fumbles. "The 
Tartars have the ball again. We'll be seein' that damned horse now!" 
</P>
<P>
 "If horses were wanted, we'd be goin' to the rodeo!" protests Feeney the 
cobbler. "Did anybody think to bring a wee drop o' the creature? I need it for 
me arthritis." 
</P>
<P>
 "In Rockne's day, we'd be ahead by 18 now," glooms Sean Logan the gravedigger. 
</P>
<P>
 "'Tis well known!" agrees Murphy the historian. "Rockne had the ear o' God. We 
never fumbled in Rockne's day. Now this fellow, Hertz or what's his name now?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Holtz, his name is Holtz," corrects O'Casey, checking his program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, he's no Rockne, now is he?" growls McDonough. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they make a movie of his life, who'll see it now?" glooms Hannifin the 
filmgoer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Woody Allen'll play him. And we all know what that means!" moans Monahan the 
nightclub bouncer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nine reels of therapy!" shouts Carmody. "It'll play the art houses." 
</P>
<P>
 "Paddy O'Brien got the Acadamy Award. The Buster itself!" shouts Finnegan the 
beer salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Oscar," growls Haggerty. "They call it the Oscar, ye great goof!" 
</P>
<P>
 On the field, Notre Dame mounts a drive. The Irish lead, 17-10. They're going 
to ice the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can we have a chorus o' 'Danny Boy'?" shouts Brady the unpublished author. 
"All 40 verses. The Wearin' o' the Green!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Up Sligo! Up Roscommon! The lilt that once through Tara's halls!" cheers 
Murtaugh. "Did yer mother come from Ireland!" 
</P>
<P>
 "A little bit o' heaven!" glows Clancy. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, down on the field, the unthinkable happens. The icing field goal is 
blocked. USC runs the ball back to the Notre Dame 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mother of God, what was that?!" cries Carmody, his face ashen. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not legal," Kinsella assures him. "There are laws and rules." 
</P>
<P>
 "It counts. 'Tis the Lord's will. The haythens will score," predicts Cobber 
Finn the barkeep. "It's a tie game, lads." 
</P>
<P>
 "A bottle with a hole in it," says O'Callaghan the paralegal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Us again, huh, Lord?!" says Horgan the iconoclast, looking menacingly at the 
sky. "Erin Go Bragh, is it? Ekrin go to hell, it is. We've been had, lads. Who 
missed Mass?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, what's that now?!" cries Cleary the optimist. "A lovely game, after 
all. We didn't lose now. To the pubs now. Innkeeper, a glass of your best. 
We'll have that tune. 'The Rose of Tralee'! Come Back to Erin!" 
</P>
<P>
 "There'll be no singing this night," snarls McGonigle. "Any man singing is 
little better than an informer. Hold the corned beef and cabbage. Nobody feels 
like eating. The pipes are not playing. We got beat, 17-17. Go home and make a 
good Act of Contrition. We've paid for your sins this day! With a blocked field 
goal!"

RAIDERS FACE '90S VERSION OF THE VAUNTED STEEL CURTAIN; PRO FOOTBALL: DEFENSIVE 
BATTLE LOOMS AGAINST PITTSBURGH'S STINGY AND BLITZING UNIT IN ANOTHER CRUCIAL 
GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the euphoria of the Raider locker room last Sunday after a victory over the 
New Orleans Saints, the question was like a bucket of cold water poured onto a 
hot barbecue. 
</P>
<P>
 What about those Pittsburgh Steelers next week? 
</P>
<P>
 Raider tailback Harvey Williams wiped a smile off his face and got serious, 
his eyes getting wider as he replied, "We're going to have to screw our bolts 
in our helmets tighter and get ready." 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers have been eliciting that reaction all season, surging through the 
NFL with hurricane force, leaving destruction in their wake by playing the kind 
of defense that became known as "the Steel Curtain" during their Super Bowl 
glory days in the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steel Curtain of the 1990s, the one Pittsburgh will hang at the Coliseum 
today for its crucial game against the Raiders, includes cornerback Rod 
Woodson, good enough to be voted onto the NFL's all-time team at the age of 29, 
and a blitzing, attacking front seven that leads the NFL in sacks with 40. 
</P>
<P>
 But with Mike Tomczak officially named the starter Friday for quarterback Neil 
O'Donnell, who is suffering from hip and ankle injuries, the Steelers might 
meet their match today in a Raider defense that seems to have peaked at just 
the right time. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, there might be a lot of bolt-tightening on both sides of the ball 
today, and a lot of bodies flying, but few points scored. 
</P>
<P>
 With injuries limiting its offensive capabilities, Pittsburgh has depended on 
its bruising defense and the foot of kicker Gary Anderson, who has made good on 
his last 19 field-goal attempts. He won last week's game, beating the Miami 
Dolphins with a 39-yard field goal in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, three of the last four Steeler games have gone to overtime, 
Pittsburgh winning two. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers have given up only 32 points in their last three games. And it 
all starts with that devastating blitz. 
</P>
<P>
 "They blitz 20 to 25 times a game," said Raider receiver Tim Brown. "If you're 
not prepared to handle it, it can cause havoc for you." 
</P>
<P>
 The success of that blitz can be seen in the fact that former Ram Kevin Greene 
and Greg Lloyd lead the team in sacks from their linebacking spots. Greene has 
10 sacks and Lloyd eight, meaning nearly half of that league-leading total is 
coming from blitzers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers lead the AFC in defense, giving up 287.5 yards a game, and are 
second in pass defense at 190.1. They have given up only 169 points, placing 
them second in the AFC in that department behind the Cleveland Browns, who are 
tied with the Steelers atop the AFC Central. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this can bring much joy to the Raiders, who have given up 32 sacks, 
tied for the third-highest total in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 But Raider quarterback Jeff Hostetler worries Woodson. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most dangerous thing he's doing and he can do to us is his scrambling 
ability," Woodson said. "He can run the ball a great deal. And he's a tough 
quarterback. I don't think we've faced a quarterback that's that tough all 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 At 6-5 and locked in a fierce battle for a postseason spot, the Raiders find 
themselves in a crucial game that probably comes down to three questions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Can Woodson stop Brown? 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who caught a career-high 80 passes last season, is on a pace to surpass 
that mark with 63 catches and five games remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Brown of Woodson: "He is the only guy who is so confident of his ability 
that he takes chances and lets you run by him because he knows he can come back 
and get you. He takes a lot of chances. Either he gets you or he loses. If he 
loses, the scoreboard lights up." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodson, who doesn't lose very often, joked about how he plans to stop Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're going to put 11 guys on Tim," he said, "and let the rest of the 
guys go." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Can the Steelers run on the Raiders? 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Steelers lead the AFC in overall defense, the Raiders lead 
against the run, giving up only 84.5 yards a game. In the last two games, 
against the Rams and the New Orleans Saints, the Raiders have surrendered a 
total of 38 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh depends on the run. Tomczak passed for a career-high 343 yards last 
week in relief of O'Donnell, but Barry Foster and Bam Morris are the offensive 
focal points. Foster, who sat out nearly four games because of a knee injury 
and returned to the starting lineup last week, has rushed for 635 yards and 
scored four touchdowns. Morris has 579 yards and four touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Raider Coach Art Shell said, "We expect them to come in here and stay with 
their strength." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Will center Don Mosebar play and be effective? 
</P>
<P>
 Mosebar is trying to recover from a twisted ankle that left him limping after 
last week's game. He improved slowly during the week. 
</P>
<P>
 As the anchor of the offensive line, Mosebar is critical in holding off the 
Steeler hordes. 
</P>
<P>
 Of one thing there can be no question: This will be a day to tighten the 
bolts. 
</P>
<P>
 Raider Note: 
</P>
<P>
 Cornerback Lionel Washington will not play for the second consecutive week 
because of a bruised calf muscle.

RAMS GUNNING FOR CHARGERS; PRO FOOTBALL: MARQUEZ POPE HAS NO LOVE FOR FORMER 
TEAM AND HAS HAD VISIONS ABOUT OUTCOME OF TODAY'S GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Safety Marquez Pope has worn the lightning bolts, has been there in the San 
Diego Charger locker room for Coach Bobby Ross' pregame speech and has taken 
delight in the sound of a cannon fired after each touchdown scored by the 
Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 But now Pope is a Ram, bent on crashing today's party in San Diego Jack Murphy 
Stadium and not that impressed with his former comrades. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do they shoot the cannon after field goals?" Pope asked sarcastically in 
reference to the Chargers' anemic offense. "Do I think the Chargers are a fluke 
at 8-3? Let me just say this: I don't think they've played anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers, losers of three of their last five games, traded Pope to the 
Rams during the off-season for a sixth-round selection in the 1995 NFL draft 
because he had failed to impress as a cornerback. Charger officials acknowledge 
they now regret the deal after watching Pope perform as the Rams' starting 
strong safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's something we have talked about," said Billy Devaney, Charger director of 
player personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Pope, a third-year pro from Long Beach Poly High and Fresno State, was a 
second-round draft pick for the Chargers in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Pope has forced a pair of fumbles, ranks third among the Rams in tackles and 
first in interceptions with three. In last week's loss to the San Francisco 
49ers, he ran helmet-first into the face of running back Ricky Watters, 
prompting Watters to say later it was the hardest hit he had ever taken in a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy's fearless," said Joe Vitt, Ram assistant head coach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers, slapped silly a week ago by the New England Patriots, have 
dominated Pope's thoughts for months. He watched them play on TV against the 
Kansas City Chiefs and says they should have lost that game. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just slipped by New Orleans," he said. "Look at the teams they have 
beaten. Seattle and Cincinnati are shaky. Denver came back and beat them." 
</P>
<P>
 And now the Rams are going to pound them -- at least that's how Pope has it 
pegged. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had this dream for some time -- I see myself just looking over at the 
Charger sideline and smiling," Pope said. "Since the day I was traded, I've 
thought about what I want to do when I get back there. I just want to explode, 
rampage all over the Chargers and show them what I can do. I don't want to rub 
it in their face, because I'm thankful to them for bringing me into the league, 
but I want them to know I was there." 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Jerome Bettis, who occupies the locker next to Pope's, said the 
Chargers have his sympathies. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wants more than anything to let them know what they're missing," Bettis 
said. "I'm sure he's going to put it on Natrone Means a couple of times, and 
after watching Pope play, I'm glad I'm not going to be on the receiving end of 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 One more headache for the Charger offense might be one too many. The offense 
has come under heavy criticism from fans in San Diego while producing three 
touchdowns in the last three games. The fans want to see more of running back 
Ronnie Harmon and better play from quarterback Stan Humphries. The team's wide 
receivers have shown an inability to catch the ball, and the offensive line has 
allowed Humphries to be sacked far too often. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not like their offense stinks, but they've had a couple of bad outings," 
said Ram defensive end Fred Stokes. "We can see what they're capable of, with 
Means gaining more than 100 yards and Humphries standing back there and 
throwing at will. We can't expect them to play the way they have been playing 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure the Chargers think their time is running short and they don't have 
the luxury of letting any more games slip away. That 6-0 stuff to start off the 
season is all behind them and now there's a sense of urgency. The red light's 
on." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers rank 10th on offense and sixth on defense with linebacker Junior 
Seau and defensive end Leslie O'Neal causing the havoc. Seau leads the Chargers 
with 115 tackles -- 49 more than any of his teammates -- and O'Neal tops the 
team with 8 1/2 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone knows that San Diego's best asset is their front four and Seau. 
Period," Pope said. "Offensively, we have to play with poise and confidence and 
defensively we have to pound the outside receivers and hit Natrone Means. And 
we have to knock Ronnie Harmon out on third down. We can be successful against 
this team." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, while playing well, have been unable to keep pace with the Chargers' 
record. They have lost five games in the last two months by seven or fewer 
points, and have lost three of their last four games. But they still have the 
ability to throw a scare into teams with visions of making it to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "To get a victory over them would be great; Kansas City would certainly be 
happy," Pope said. "It's a chance to explode, to let it all out and just maybe

LILLEHAMMER '94: 16 DAYS OF GLORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY WILNER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It takes nearly one hour for Bud Greenspan's "Lillehammer '94: 16 Days of 
Glory" to get glorious. When it does, hardly anyone can keep a dry eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan, who has chronicled the Olympics for 40 years, put together a 
two-part film memory of the Lillehammer Games. The first portion will air 
Sunday night on The Disney Channel, with the second part scheduled for next 
Feb. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 The first two hours are dedicated to ski jumping, figure skating, 
cross-country skiing and speed skating. More specifically, the spotlight is 
turned on gold medalists Jens Weissflog and Espen Bredesen in the opening 
segment, followed by Oksana Baiul, then Manuela Di Centa and Lyubov Egorova. 
</P>
<P>
 But the film doesn't really get moving until the focus turns to Dan Jansen. 
</P>
<P>
 "His emotion, his honesty convinced me to pursue his story in depth," said 
Greenspan, who at first was reluctant to make Jansen's saga a central part of 
the film. "He was so real, so expressive, that I realized I had to tell his 
story -- through his eyes. He tells it so poignantly, so beautifully." 
</P>
<P>
 Jansen's story of repeated Olympic disappointment and related tragedy finally 
leading to triumph is as moving in "16 Days of Glory" as it was when it was 
winning his gold medal. Wisely, Greenspan tells the entire story, going back to 
1984 at Sarajevo, when Jansen was a surprise fourth after expecting nothing 
more than a top 15 finish. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, of course, Jansen fell twice as a favorite, but with the most valid 
of excuses: His sister, Jane, died of leukemia the morning of his first Olympic 
race at Calgary. The film allows Jansen's words and actions to tell the story. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years later, at Albertville, Jansen was victimized by slow tracks and, 
perhaps, being over-prepared. So he came to Lillehammer, his final Olympics, as 
one of the biggest busts in Winter Olympics history. 
</P>
<P>
 And then he failed again, finishing eighth in the 500, a race he had dominated 
during the World Cup season. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was my race," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan's cameras often focus on Jansen's wife, Robin, and his daughter, 
Jane, named after his sister. Robin provides an insightful analysis of Jansen's 
500 race, as well as relating her husband's thoughts through four Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Jansen then admits his fear of the 1,000 and relates how a sports 
psychologist helped him overcome it. As for a gold medal, however, "I sort of 
was prepared that it just wasn't going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 When it did, America celebrated, and "16 Days of Glory" captures the emotions 
superbly, particularly when Jansen reflects on his past from the medals podium 
during the playing of the "Star Spangled Banner." 
</P>
<P>
 He narrates his thoughts at that moment: "My whole career, to my family, 
Robin, even to my daughter, Jane," he said. "And to my sister, Jane, very much 
so." 
</P>
<P>
 Then Jansen looks up and salutes his sister before taking the victory lap with 
baby Jane in his arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, much of Greenspan's film doesn't come close to that level of 
drama and emotion. The cross-country segment featuring Di Centa of Italy and 
Egorova of Russia is too long. The footage of the ski jumping is spectacular, 
but the interviews with Weissflog and Bredesen fall flat. 
</P>
<P>
 To his credit, Greenspan focused on Baiul rather than the Nancy Kerrigan-Tonya 
Harding mess in the figure skating. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was the real story of the figure skating," he said of the Ukrainian 
orphan, who won the gold medal at 16. "Harding and Kerrigan was not an 
inspirational story. It had nothing to do with the beauty and the spirit of the 
competition. It was ludicrous that all people talked about was Tonya and 
Nancy." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, there is little inspired storytelling in the segment on Baiul, 
or the other three. But the Jansen stuff makes up for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The second part of "16 Hours of Glory" will focus on skaters Bonnie Blair and 
Johann Olav Koss, skiers Alberto Tomba and Vladimir Smirnoff, bobsledders 
Wolfgang Hoppe and Prince Albert of Monaco and the thrilling men's 4x10 
kilometer cross-country relay race.

ABC HAS TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Was this the Twilight Zone or what? Or was that really Tom Kelly's voice on 
the ABC telecast for a couple of plays during the third quarter of Saturday's 
USC-Notre Dame 17-17 tie? 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Ticket's Kelly turning up on ABC was only one of the bizarre occurrences 
caused by a power outage in the television compound and other parts of the 
Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 The outage, which lasted about 45 minutes, knocked ABC off the air with eight 
seconds left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the second half began, ABC producer Bob Goodrich had made 
arrangements to borrow a feed from Prime Ticket, which was taping the game for 
showing later Saturday night and wasn't affected by the outage. 
</P>
<P>
 But ABC still had to figure out a way to get some kind of audio over the air. 
</P>
<P>
 For a while, ABC announcers Keith Jackson and Bob Griese used telephones, but 
their voices were almost unintelligible. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC then went to Kelly and Prime Ticket partner Craig Fertig, but soon lost 
them. Next, John Saunders calling the game from an ABC studio in New York.Just 
about then the problem was rectified. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack O'Hara, the executive producer of ABC Sports who was in the New York 
studio but in phone contract with the crew in Los Angeles, was informed after 
the game that the outage was caused by a main breaker at the stadium blowing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our No. 1 priority was to give viewers coverage of the game no matter how we 
did it," O'Hara said. "We owe a great deal of gratitude to Prime Ticket for 
supplying us with a picture." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, not much was missed except a field-goal try by USC's Cole Ford at 
the end of the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 That's not nearly as bad as what happened in 1986, when CBS missed John 
Carney's game-winning field goal in a 38-37 Notre Dame victory over USC because 
of an ill-timed commercial break. CBS had to show the kick on tape.

GIRLS' BASKETBALL 1994-1995: SEA VIEW LEAGUE; ON COURT, BURGESS STRIKES RIGHT

<P>
 At first, Angela Burgess just wanted to sing. 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess, a senior at Woodbridge, has been singing since she was 2 years old. 
As the daughter of a singing coach, she had ample opportunities to do so -- at 
home, in musicals, at church or wherever anyone would listen. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Burgess reached the end of eighth grade, she and her parents realized 
something: Angela was taller than almost all of her classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 So she and her father, Ken, decided to give basketball a try. Ken made her a 
deal: You play, and I'll coach the team. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was a catch: There were no leagues for girls in the area, so Angela 
instead played in a boys' league in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 She was the only girl in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really didn't want to do it, because it was embarrassing," Burgess said. "I 
spent half the game worrying about what I looked like, but once I got into it, 
I got the respect of the guys -- they saw I could actually play." 
</P>
<P>
 And it didn't take long for Burgess to adjust. She scored in double figures 
her fourth game and had 15 points and 12 rebounds her fifth game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started getting used to playing around the fourth game, and I took it from 
there," she said. "I saw I could do this. I'm thinking, 'This isn't very hard.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball has come pretty easy for Burgess since then, too. She averaged 13.3 
points and 12.4 rebounds last year, when she was a key member of Woodbridge's 
team that made it to the State Division II finals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors finished 32-1 last season, their only loss a 71-38 thumping by 
Sacramento El Camino in the State final. It weighed heavily on Burgess. 
</P>
<P>
 "To experience a loss that way was heartbreaking; it was really hard," she 
said. "It's pretty harsh losing one game and having it be your last, and losing 
that bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was one of the more depressed ones after the game. I had played three years 
with Jamie (Oenning, Woodbridge's leading scorer), and ending it that way for 
her was awful for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess was held to nine points and seven rebounds, and could not keep up with 
El Camino's Emily Hart, who had 15 points, 13 rebounds and six blocked shots. 
</P>
<P>
 But that game provided Burgess the motivation to work hard in the off-season, 
particularly in the weight room. As a result, Burgess, already considered one 
of the county's strongest players, is even stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the beginning of the summer I started squatting 125 pounds," she said. 
"But the last time we lifted (maximum weight), I set a school girls' record of 
300 pounds. It was more than some of our football players could do. 
</P>
<P>
 "My goal is to lead the county in rebounding, so that's why I worked hard on 
lifting." 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess said it's not a given the Warriors will return to the State final, but 
with four returning starters . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I guess the ones who played before kind of expect to get there, since we got 
there last season," she said. "As long as we play each game and win each game, 
I don't see why not." 
</P>
<P>
 "We really want to get there. I don't want to leave without winning (a section 
title) this year, but if we win State, it would be the best senior year anybody 
could have." 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess said she hopes to play basketball and compete in track and field 
(shotput and discus) in college. 
</P>
<P>
 Several schools are recruiting her, but Burgess, who will make her decision 
during the late signing period, is leaning toward Brigham Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess said she could even focus on her two favorite pastimes in college. She 
may major in musical theater. 1993-94 / IN REVIEW

Highlights 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge picked a bad time to lose its only game of the year--the State 
Division II final. The Warriors lost to Sacramento El Camino, 71-38, shooting 
24.2% (16 for 66) from the field. Woodbridge couldn't find much competition in 
the Southern California playoffs, recording easy victories over Bakersfield 
East, 71-41, and San Bernardino, 84-63, before edging past Alemany, 46-41, in 
the regional final. It found the going tougher in the Southern Section 
playoffs. The Warriors were taken to overtime in the quarterfinals by Oxnard 
Rio Mesa before they won, 49-44. They won the section title with a 59-47 
victory over Hemet. Of Newport Harbor's eight losses, four came against teams 
that qualified for a State final. The Sailors lost twice each to Woodbridge and 
Brea-Olinda. Brea defeated Newport Harbor, 70-40, in the Southern Section 
Division III-AA final, and 67-39 in the regional final. Newport Harbor's run 
through the playoffs was kept alive by Gina Heads. Irvine's appearance in the 
Division I-A playoffs was short-lived. The Vaqueros lost to Channel Islands, 
48-36, in the first round. University also fell in the first round, 62-61, to 
Corona. . . . Newport Harbor's Genevieve Evarts and Jamie Oenning of Woodbridge 
shared league player of the year honors. Jennifer Stanley of University led the 
league in scoring with a 17.5 average. Rosalie Kane of Corona del Mar was the 
league's top rebounder, at 14.3.

ANALYSIS; NHL NEGOTIATORS GET TOGETHER, BUT NOT ON ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 Negotiators for the NHL and its players' association met six times in 10 days 
before breaking Saturday, after union officials requested time to plan 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it encouraging that they're talking so much, or are they merely running in 
place? Are players stalling, expecting owners to cave in around Christmas, or 
have they gone as far as they intend to go, as some sources say? 
</P>
<P>
 NHL executives left Saturday's meeting in Boston wearing grim expressions. 
Talks might resume there this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a sense of anticipation on our side that we'd have two big days 
here. The fact that we didn't get anything done at all leaves you a little 
frustrated," Bruin General Manager Harry Sinden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Toronto General Manager Cliff Fletcher: "I don't know whose court the 
ball is in, but whoever has it, they'd better start playing with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Here's where they stand on the pivotal issues. All agreements are in principle 
and are subject to revision. ENTRY-LEVEL SALARIES AND RIGHTS 
</P>
<P>
 The union was soft on rookie salaries from the start, and it's no surprise it 
agreed to a cap that will limit salaries to be paid over players' first three 
seasons. However, the limit will be the subject of heated discussion. The union 
wants rookies to average $1.5 million per season, but the league is looking at 
about $750,000 per season.  
</P>
<P>
 They agreed to institute two-way contracts that include a minor league pay 
scale. They've also agreed that players won't be eligible for salary 
arbitration or free agency during their first three seasons. No great losses 
for players here, but no huge gains for owners, either. FREE AGENCY 
</P>
<P>
 Compensation for players in Group 2 -- more than three years' NHL experience 
but under age 28 -- will be reduced from five first-round picks, probably to 
three picks. The union will insist on that, having given in on allowing clubs 
to retain the right to match offers made to their free agents. Players will get 
the easier free agency they sought, because three picks inhibit, but don't 
prohibit, signings.  
</P>
<P>
 As proposed by the NHL, players in Group 3 -- who are at least 28 and have 
either eight years' NHL service or 10 years' pro experience -- would be granted 
unrestricted free agency. The exception would be one designated "franchise 
player" per club. Clubs would retain the right to match offers made to those 
players. The NHLPA is fighting this, believing it would severely restrict the 
movement of elite players. It has no strong objections to the age or service 
terms. SALARY ARBITRATION 
</P>
<P>
 The league wants only Group 2 players to be eligible and it wants arbitration 
to be non-binding on the club. In hearings, players would be able to compare 
themselves only to other Group 2 players. The club might also be allowed to 
release players if it disagrees with the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The NHLPA doesn't like non-binding arbitration and would agree only if players 
are granted free agency if their clubs reject the arbitrator's decision. TAX 
CONCEPT 
</P>
<P>
 This is hovering over the talks like a vulture, waiting to kill a deal. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of owners are willing to discard the proposed payroll tax, which 
would be assessed against clubs who exceed a predetermined limit, but they do 
want a mechanism to slow salary growth. The league has brought up a tax on 
rookie signings that exceed a certain level and on free-agent signings. Also 
possible is a payroll tax that adjusts according to the previous season's rate 
of revenue and salary growth. The NHL is still willing to impose a tax on gate 
receipts, with proceeds going to small-market clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Players oppose a payroll tax, claiming it functions as a salary cap. Remember, 
though, they vowed early on not to accept a rookie cap. Sources say players, if 
threatened with no season, would accept a payroll tax that peaks at 30% if it's 
coupled with a gate tax. That would signify to players that owners are willing 
to share the tax burden. ENTRY DRAFT 
</P>
<P>
 They agree on an eight-round draft of 20-year-old players, with provisions for 
18- and 19-year-olds to enter. However, the NHL wants clubs to retain rights to 
drafted players for three years. The union wants to maintain the current 
two-year rule. MISCELLANEOUS 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Gary Bettman, who wants to guarantee prospective expansion owners 
they will have long-term labor peace, wants a six- or seven-year deal. Players 
don't want to commit themselves for more than three or four years to new 
restrictions that might pinch their wallets dramatically. They also see a boom 
period coming and want to get their share. Bettman got his way (a four-year 
pact) in last year's strike by on-ice officials, and a similar term might work 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 Players have discussed cutting the first round or two of the playoffs to best 
of five, but owners are unlikely to go along because they make most of their 
profits on playoff tickets.  
</P>
<P>
 If they can't get owners to pay their full salaries for the season -- owners 
will never go for that -- players will ask to be paid from the day they report 
to camp, not from the day the season starts. They will probably win that point.

CHARTER OAK'S GRAHAM ARRESTED; PREP FOOTBALL: RUNNING BACK CHARGED WEDNESDAY 
WITH SUSPICION OF RECEIVING STOLEN PROPERTY, THEN PLAYS FRIDAY. HIS COACH SAYS 
HE IS INNOCENT.

<P>
 Covina Charter Oak High running back Michael Graham was arrested Wednesday 
morning and charged with suspicion of receiving stolen property, The Times has 
learned.  
</P>
<P>
 Graham, 16, was arrested on the Charter Oak campus at 11:48 a.m., a 
spokesperson for the Covina Police Department said.He was released Wednesday in 
the custody of his parents. Police said the case will be forwarded to the Los 
Angeles County Juvenile Probation Department for further investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham, a junior who has rushed for 2,266 yards and 30 touchdowns this season, 
played in the Chargers' Southern Section Division VI second-round playoff game 
against La Verne Damien Friday night and rushed for 202 yards in 27 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Charter Oak Coach Louis Farrar was approached by a reporter before his team's 
game Friday, but denied the charge against Graham. Farrar later confirmed 
Graham's arrest but said his player was innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened was a real problem, and our superintendent and principal 
quickly handled the situation," Farrar said after the Chargers' 33-14 victory. 
"I think this was all a big mistake and he'll be proven clean in the next 
couple of months. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael isn't the only person involved here." 
</P>
<P>
 Covina police confirmed that another male, age 16, was also arrested Wednesday 
at Charter Oak and charged with suspicion of receiving stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham's parents, Leanzo and Lucinda, both refused to comment on the case 
Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham, one of the leading rushers in the state, has transferred from three 
high schools -- including Santa Ana Mater Dei and Huntington Beach Edison -- 
during the last three years.

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; DEBT OF HONOR; CONSTANCE RICE WAS RAISED TO BELIEVE THAT 
SHE SHOULD ADVANCE THE CAUSE OF RACIAL AND ECONOMIC JUSTICE. NOW, AS COUNSEL 
FOR THE NAACP LEGAL DEFENSE AND EDUCATIONAL FUND, SHE'S DOING IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT SHIBUYA BROWN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Constance Rice has done the math dozens of times, for all sorts of equations. 
Even though her numbers tell the same story every time, for the benefit of a 
visitor she repeats them, setting the figures off like depth charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Example: African American children make up only 9% of the state's non-adult 
population but 40% of its juvenile prison population. Latinos make up another 
39% of juvenile inmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Rice, her words heightened by a cool gaze and a quiet, almost droll 
delivery: "You might as well just put the crib in the cell." 
</P>
<P>
 And last year, she says later, pointing to a plastic drawing board with a blue 
scrawl of numbers, the Metropolitan Transit Authority spent as little as 38 
cents in subsidies on each of its bus riders, who make up 94% of its customers. 
The more affluent Metrolink passengers -- the other 6% -- received upward of 
$30 per person. 
</P>
<P>
 "Third World buses for Third World people," Rice says. 
</P>
<P>
 To her mind, the MTA issue also neatly symbolizes the yawning chasm of race 
and class in Los Angeles, as well as government's attitude toward poorer 
citizens. As Western regional counsel for the NAACP Legal Defense and 
Educational Fund, and in her role as a county Department of Water and Power 
commissioner, she is trying to bridge those often formidable divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no other place in the U.S. that presents any more complex problems," 
Rice says, sitting amid an agreeable clutter of books and documents in her 
Downtown LDF office. "This is where it's at. What happens in L.A. in civil and 
economic rights is going to tell us whether we keep our constitutional 
democracy."

 Keeping that system alive and whole has kept Rice, 38, running for most of the 
last 20 years. From trying to win a stay of execution for a Death Row inmate to 
filing suit against powerful institutions, a sense of mission imbues her life. 
It is a commitment so serious that she steadfastly refuses to comment on her 
private life, arguing that it might affect public opinion and diminish her 
ability to represent her clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Connie speaks, people listen," says Lani Guinier, an early Rice mentor 
and ill-fated Clinton Administration nominee for assistant attorney general. 
"(Her work) is not just a legal exercise. It's a commitment to doing justice. 
She has a moral vision without being ideological." 
</P>
<P>
 DWP Commission President Dennis A. Tito agrees: "I couldn't think of a better 
person to lead (her) fight." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The emphasis on doing, and doing well, was imparted by her mother, a 
schoolteacher, and her father, an Air Force officer. "She'd work us so hard in 
the summer," Rice says of her mother, "that school was a break." 
</P>
<P>
 An itinerant military life allowed Rice an unusual perspective on race and 
class, she says. By her count, she attended four high schools, two middle 
schools and three grade schools, bouncing from Texas to North Carolina to 
California to London to Japan and back again. She finally graduated from a high 
school in San Antonio.  
</P>
<P>
 At each stop, Rice recalls, she and her two younger brothers would face 
several hurdles relating to their minority status in usually all-white schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The first was socialization: "You had to learn how to break the ice quickly 
and reach people," Rice says. "You were the ones to make people feel 
comfortable. You had to make white people feel comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 The second involved guidance counselors' disinclination to place the Rice 
children in college-prep classes. That would prompt a calm visit from a 
determined Mrs. Rice, who would insist on advanced classes, a battle she always 
won. "We would have been tracked into mediocrity if not for her," Rice recalls. 
Her illiterate grandfather had been similarly strict, making sure that all 10 
of his children went to college.  
</P>
<P>
 The Rices were also schooled in life's expectations, and that meant using 
their education to advance the cause of racial and economic justice. "It got 
passed on to us," Rice says, "that you had to be one of the people paying back, 
one of the people trying to open doors rather than resting on your laurels. I'm 
still paying back that debt." 
</P>
<P>
 Both of her brothers are now physicians, and crusaders in their work as well, 
Rice says half-jokingly. A cousin, Condoleezza Rice, became the provost at 
Stanford University after serving as President George Bush's special assistant 
for national security affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 When it came time for college, Constance Rice planned to major in 
communications at Northwestern University, in hopes of becoming a television 
newscaster. But her father brought home a Radcliffe application and made her 
fill it out. She sent it off and promptly forgot about it until receiving an 
acceptance notice. Only then did she learn she was bound for an academically 
rigorous women's college. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon arrival in Boston, though, a chagrined Rice discovered that she actually 
had been admitted to the newly co-ed Harvard. "I cried for two weeks because I 
didn't want to be there," she recalls. "I'm probably the only one in the 
history of Harvard to feel that way." 
</P>
<P>
 Her experiences didn't warm her to the campus either. At the time, in the 
mid-'70s, the city was embroiled in a school desegregation battle that included 
assaults by anti-busing foes on Harvard's black women students. And Rice 
recalls another sobering encounter: She wandered into a biology lab one day to 
find a life-sized replica of an African man in a glass cage. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was at Harvard, I never felt blacker in my life," Rice says. "It was 
never an issue until I went there. It was a hostile environment in which to 
learn. Everything about you was under siege." 
</P>
<P>
 College provided other life-defining moments as well. In her freshman year, 
after a male acquaintance with whom she had been arguing beat her up, Rice got 
into the martial arts with a vengeance. "If my words could evoke that type of 
reaction, I needed some protection," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years later, after receiving her degree in government, she had not 
only earned her black belt in tae kwon do and fought in regional exhibitions -- 
including one at Madison Square Garden -- but also won a silver medal in the 
1981 national championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no longer in championship form, Rice credits her martial arts 
training with giving her the fearlessness her work demands. "It gave me 
complete entitlement to my environment," she says. "I could not accept 
constraints and do what I had to do." 
</P>
<P>
 After a few years spent running Harvard's minority recruitment program, Rice's 
sense of purpose led her to New York University law school, where she hoped to 
specialize in public interest law. There, too, she tangled with the politics of 
the institution. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite stellar grades, Rice refused to participate in law review and instead 
volunteered at the local LDF office. Her apparent snub brought on the enmity of 
the administration and faculty members, who later wrote her only halfhearted 
recommendations for post-graduate clerkships, she says. Rice was thinking of 
suing the school when she received a prestigious Federal Appeals Court 
clerkship, won partly through Guinier's endorsement and partly through Rice's 
point-blank request for the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to do an end run around the institution, which is what African 
Americans often have to do," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 After two years with a big San Francisco firm "to see what it was like," Rice 
in 1986 became a special assistant to the vice chancellor at UCLA, 
trouble-shooting on issues of race, admissions and money, among other things. 
But four years later, when the job opened at the Western LDF office, she 
decided to re-enter the social advocacy arena. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you wanted to do (public interest law), there was no higher calling than 
this," she says. "This was Thurgood Marshall's law firm." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That calling comes with a price. Preserving the Constitution can be an 
exhausting and relatively low-paying job. Earning about the same wage as a 
paralegal in a big law firm, Rice says, she and four other attorneys often put 
in stretches of 16-hour days in preparing major cases. What the LDF wants is 
nothing less than institutional transformation. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded 55 years ago by Marshall and Charles Houston, the LDF has been 
credited by many with effectively desegregating the nation. (Although still 
attached to the NAACP in name, the LDF broke ties with the organization more 
than 30 years ago and is commonly known as the Fund.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not interested in hearts and minds," Rice says. "You can hate Latinos, 
women and blacks. You can do that under the First Amendment. What you're not 
free to do is to take these beliefs and make policies that put barriers in 
peoples' lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Only six years old, the LDF office in Los Angeles was established as a 
laboratory, as Rice puts it, to grapple with the future of civil rights. Its 
counterparts in New York and Washington, D.C., pursue more traditional civil 
right agendas. 
</P>
<P>
 The constant press for resources requires Rice and associates to focus on the 
big picture, litigating when they see injustices with the potential to do the 
most damage to the most people. "She's an extraordinary advocate," Abby J. 
Leibman of the California Women's Law Center says of Rice. 
</P>
<P>
 It also means firing solitary shots against sometimes elephantine targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Last July, when the MTA sought to implement a 25-cent bus fare increase and 
eliminate monthly passes for unlimited ridership on the agency's 1,900 buses, 
the LDF perceived a fundamental injustice that went beyond simple fare hikes. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the vehicle to showcase racial and class inequity in the '90s, and 
every other (public interest law firm) said, 'No,' " to taking the case, Rice 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposals amount to "the poor subsidizing the rich," she says, because the 
agency's commuter trains ferry a relatively affluent ridership that is the 
beneficiary of nearly 80% of MTA's local transit resources. And just before 
approving the fare increase designed to make up for an anticipated budget 
shortfall, the agency earmarked millions to build a Metrolink rail extension. 
</P>
<P>
 While the case runs its legal course, the MTA will not get its wish. 
</P>
<P>
 The LDF has also taken on the Los Angeles Police Department over its K-9 unit. 
In a one-year period, Rice says, the 16-officer unit racked up a use-of-force 
rate 10 times higher than the department as a whole and put more people -- 
primarily blacks and Latinos -- in the hospital than the LAPD's 7,000 other 
officers combined. The department is now settling with the LDF on damages for 
the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Such victories are sweet given the recent decade of retrenchment in civil 
rights litigation and the prevailing public sentiment against spending money or 
sympathy on the dispossessed, Rice says. That message has had a Malthusian 
impact, she believes, with the city's poor unleashing their desperation and 
anger on one another. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Rice spends much of her time tending tenuous coalitions, ensuring 
that the LDF and other public advocacy groups, such as the Mexican-American 
Legal Defense and Educational Fund and the American Civil Liberties Union, 
remain united on large issues. That has meant mobilizing African Americans in 
the fight against Proposition 187 and supporting MALDEF in its efforts to bring 
Latino representation to largely Latino districts. And it has meant accepting 
an appointment to the DWP Commission two years ago -- even after the City 
Council rejected her colleague Melanie Lomax for the post -- to monitor the 
impact of environmental policy on the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 It is an arduous task. "The level of fighting, fear and animosity makes it 
very difficult to push a multicultural agenda (in this city)," Rice says. "But 
we can't afford to look at each other as the enemy. We're not friends, but 
we're not enemies either." 
</P>
<P>
 Although disappointed in the recent state election results in favor of 
Proposition 187 and Gov. Wilson, Rice vows to use them to her advantage, to 
"educate people on what I'm fighting against." 
</P>
<P>
 In the short term, she expects that fight to get nastier. And she expects to 
raise her voice even higher and crunch even more numbers. Anything to avoid a 
social meltdown "that will make 1992 look like a picnic." 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't be part of the Legal Defense Fund and worry about what the 
mainstream wants," Rice says. "If the mainstream had its way, we'd still be 
picking cotton. Thurgood Marshall was quite clear -- you were supposed to be a 
policy engineer here, a social engineer. If you were a regular lawyer, you were 
just protecting the status quo." Constance Rice 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 38. 
</P>
<P>
 Native?: No. Born in Washington, D.C., lives in the Hollywood Hills.  
</P>
<P>
 Hobbies: Swimming, running, tae kwon do. Also, before she got too busy, 
photography, pottery and painting. "I used to be a halfway interesting person," 
Rice jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 On why she doesn't discuss her private life: "People need to perceive you in 
ways that diminish the scope of your work. And women are particularly subject 
to that. The strength of my professional persona is mine, and it's not due to 
whomever I'm involved with or the children I have or don't have. The integrity 
of my work doesn't need to be matched to an imaginary private life. People are 
not capable of separating the two." 
</P>
<P>
 On Los Angeles: "You've got every kind of human being known to woman here and 
there's no mixing." 
</P>
<P>
 On the price of color: "They have done surveys and asked white students, 'How 
much would you have to be paid to be black?' And they said, 'A million dollars 
a year.' So for people to pretend that they don't know the price of color, I 
don't buy it. Because when they're asked, they can put a price on it."

UNDER L.A.'S TOUGH SKIN BEATS A HEART OF GOLD; SAMARITANS: CRIME, RIOTS AND 
QUAKES ARE WHAT THIS CITY IS BEST KNOWN FOR. BUT THERE ARE ACTS OF KINDNESS 
GOING ON ALL THE TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Imagine that Los Angeles hires one of its best advertising firms for an image 
make-over. The whiz kids crowd around a conference table in some glassy office, 
striving for the perfect theme to revive a battered, demoralized city. 
</P>
<P>
 They would see that what L.A. needs is to remind the world -- and itself -- of 
its own goodness. And they would see -- yes! -- that the lady in the police 
station is the perfect symbol for their campaign. Because if prizes were given 
for restoring faith in humankind, this lady might be at the podium making an 
acceptance speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is what she did. 
</P>
<P>
 On Labor Day weekend, while at the Rampart station Downtown on business, she 
brushed by a weeping man with a little boy in tow. She learned that the man, 
his wife and two children were about to be evicted from their apartment. A 
self-employed photographer, the man had been unable to work for three months 
after falling ill with tuberculosis. Now he was broke. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman gave a sergeant a list of social service agencies, but they were 
closed for the holiday weekend or could not help. So the sergeant, Mike Diaz, 
called the woman at home. He'd struck out, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll be there in 20 minutes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She returned with an envelope. Inside was $800 cash, $100 more than the 
photographer needed to postpone eviction. She gave it to the sergeant and told 
him to keep her name a secret. 
</P>
<P>
 "She saved my family. I was crying," said the photographer, Martin Wilson, 
recalling the moment Diaz handed him the cash. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lady was like an angel that came to me, like she was my mother, helping 
me without any concern for herself. If there were more people like her, there 
wouldn't be so much crime and violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes it does seem that Los Angeles, once the good-vibe land of 
opportunity, has hit the skids: racism, riots, earthquakes, wildfires, bizarre 
murders and a lousy economy. But maybe it isn't quite so bad. Because if the 
tale of the nameless woman with the envelope of cash could launch the "L.A. Has 
a Heart" campaign, many others could serve as its billboards, TV commercials 
and radio spots. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Louis Delgado, a City of Commerce custodian, who heard a woman scream 
that her purse had just been stolen. He hustled her into his car and chased the 
running purse-snatcher through the streets. They lost him, but police made an 
arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Stephanie Taylor, a Union Station ticket clerk who stayed for two 
hours after her shift ended, phoning social service agencies to keep a runaway 
teen-ager from spending the night on the cold floor. On another day, ticket 
clerks pooled their money to buy a ticket to Oakland for a young, penniless 
woman. "She just pulled these employees' heartstrings," recalled supervisor Dee 
Dee Hogan. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the newlywed couple who came to the aid of a young woman who stood 
outside El Segundo City Hall one night, weeping because her tire had blown out 
and she was stranded, alone, with no money for a tow. The lovebirds changed her 
flat and drove off, waving. 
</P>
<P>
 In a city where cops evoke images of videotaped abuse, a group of officers 
from the Southeast division resurrected an elderly woman's faith in humankind. 
</P>
<P>
 Blind, alone and in her 90s, the woman had endured repeated break-ins, some by 
burglars brazen enough to storm the house while she was in it. Arrests were 
made, but Officer Franck Peter and a few of his colleagues still felt uneasy. 
</P>
<P>
 So one weekend last year, on their own time and with their own money, they 
burglar-proofed the home, boarding up a rear window, replacing a lock and 
installing a metal plate to prevent the front door from being kicked in again, 
Peter said. Before leaving, they cleaned up piles of debris inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, the officers tracked down the woman's friends and enlisted them to 
persuade her to move out of the neighborhood. She is now living safely in a 
nursing home. 
</P>
<P>
 And the stories of kindness go on. Ana Martinez-Holler heard a clerk tell a 
little girl in a City of Industry bookstore that she didn't have enough money 
for the book she had chosen. Martinez-Holler made up the difference, 
remembering how much she loved to read when she was the same age. 
</P>
<P>
 Teen-agers, who tend to make the news only if they shoot someone or get shot, 
commit their own acts of kindness. Consider the young man of about 15 who 
recently approached Steve LePore, executive director of My Friend's Place, a 
drop-in center for homeless youths in Hollywood. The teen-ager, a drug-addicted 
prostitute who finds his meals in Dumpsters, asked LePore for a blanket. 
Wordlessly, he draped it over a stranger -- another boy, curled up, asleep and 
shivering. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen-year-old Edna Becerra stepped off the bus in her South Gate 
neighborhood one afternoon last summer to find a 5-year-old girl leaning 
against a tree, crying. 
</P>
<P>
 The child told Edna that she was afraid to go inside because her father was 
drunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Edna walked three-quarters of a mile to escort her to the police station. When 
the little girl cried as Edna was leaving, the teen-ager waited with her for 
several hours until the child's mother arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this job, you get hardened because the only teen-agers you see are 
gangbangers and taggers," said Sgt. Keith Underwood. "Meeting someone like Edna 
shakes you back to reality. It makes you realize they're not all bad." 
</P>
<P>
 To Edna, the hours of selflessness were no big deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "My parents have always taught me to be good to other people," she said. "If I 
was in her situation, I would hope someone would do that for me." 
</P>
<P>
 It was with the same nonchalance -- it was no big deal, it was just the right 
thing to do -- that Eddie M. Turner of Ladera Heights recently gave a little 
extra. 
</P>
<P>
 On duty for Gerontology Home Companion, a Santa Monica agency that provides 
nursing aides to the elderly, Turner got a call from a distraught woman who had 
just learned that her husband had Parkinson's disease. 
</P>
<P>
 It was part of Turner's job to visit the woman, but not to bring her a huge 
bouquet of sunflowers and gladioli. 
</P>
<P>
 "She cried for about 10 minutes," Turner said. "It just seemed like the right 
thing for me to do. She needed a friend." 
</P>
<P>
 Another woman who needed a friend picked up a pay phone a few months ago and 
got lucky. She found Bonnie Lucido on the other end of the line. Lucido, of 
Long Beach, was volunteering as a listener for the Hotline of Southern 
California, a crisis intervention agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The caller was a single mother of five who had managed to work her way off the 
welfare rolls, then lost her job when she had to tend her sick baby for four 
days. Now she had no money for food. 
</P>
<P>
 Lucido called all over town to find help, but on a Sunday evening there was 
none. So she met the family at a Stanton store and bought them not only 
groceries but a few toys for the children. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was either let her get off the phone and be hungry, and let her kids go 
hungry, or do something," Lucido said. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it was that a great moment passed between Lucido and the woman whose 
name she never knew. It was one in a long string of great moments within the 
city that, when strung together, begin to form an outline. The outline of a 
heart.

DESTINATION: U.S. HOLIDAY EVENTS 1994; GLOW TIME, U.S.A.; CITIES AROUND THE 
COUNTRY LIGHTEN UP FOR THE HOLIDAY SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Morning News, is a free-lance writer.

<P>
 Home for the holidays is the romantic ideal. Chestnuts roasting on an open 
fire. Presents under the tree. Visits from loved ones. Children nestled all 
snug in their beds. A sink full of greasy pots and pans. Bored relatives 
sniping at each other for entertainment. Harried last-minute shopping. 
Sugarplums stuck to the drapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe away for the holidays isn't such a bad idea after all. 
</P>
<P>
 All over the country, professional tourism elves have been festooning their 
hometowns with baubles, bows and twinkling lights, all to help visitors reach 
holiday nirvana. They've provided pageantry and jollity and all the shopping 
you could want to do (as if you have a choice). 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, these Christmas extravaganzas also help keep the elves in jobs, 
giving many places new life in the wintertime. 
</P>
<P>
 Branson, Mo., has more than doubled its winter crowd since introducing Ozark 
Mountain Winter in 1988, and winter employment has soared. The Opryland USA 
theme park in Nashville, Tenn., inaugurated a winter season last year, 
following in the very successful footsteps of the Opryland Hotel, which 
introduced its Country Christmas in 1984. In Arizona, Tempe will have its first 
Fantasy of Lights this year, patterned after a successful one in Niagara Falls, 
although the goal is more about community spirit than attracting additional 
winter visitors, says Aimee Fantazier of the convention and visitors bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 But for you, it's all just a chance to indulge in a little Christmas you don't 
have to clean up after. Take a jaunt now, just for the fun of it, or, if you 
happen to be going to one of these places anyway, plan a little mid-holiday 
escape from that houseful of bickering relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 What follows is a sampling of some of the country's holiday celebrations, 
listed alphabetically by state. If you don't find the right festival here, the 
elves at any convention and visitors bureau or chamber of commerce should be 
able to help. Arizona 
</P>

WEEKEND ESCAPE: TEMECULA; GALLOPING GOOD TIME; WHETHER PLAYING COWBOY OR POLO 
PRINCE, RANCHO PAVOREAL HAS A HORSE FOR ANY RIDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAT GERBER, Gerber, formerly an editor at The Times, recently moved to 
London. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My idea of a good time is horsing around -- not betting on the ponies but 
riding them. Finding a place this side of Wyoming, however, where the steeds 
are eager, trails endless and where I can be pampered with fine food and wine 
after a ride has been like chasing the ghost of John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I discovered Rancho Pavoreal in the high desert of Riverside County. The 
ranch, albeit expensive, turned out to be the perfect elixir for raging cases 
of horse fever -- mine, my husband's and my 8-year-old daughter's. 
</P>
<P>
 I also found that I needed to look no further for the spirit of The Duke -- he 
used to own this 4,000-acre spread. 
</P>
<P>
 The sprawling ranch house is set on a knoll commanding a valley near Sage, 17 
miles east of Temecula. It is surrounded by hardscrabble landscape and lush 
green fields, the kind that invite a good gallop. Mt. Palomar rises in the 
distant haze.  
</P>
<P>
 As we pulled up to the ranch house one recent Saturday afternoon, three men 
were seated on the veranda, legs stretched in front of them, sipping lemonade 
and beer. They waved lazily, the picture of relaxation. Our girls, 8 and 4, 
bolted from the car and were greeted with big licks from Dolly, a black and 
white Great Dane the size of a pony and with the temperament of a pussycat. The 
children dashed for the veranda and the green lawn that spread before it. But 
they pulled up short, eyes fixed to the ground. There, coiled in the shade of a 
spreading oak and as still as the dead, lay a rattler. 
</P>
<P>
 Our host, Allen Senall, shook hands with us, then chuckled as he watched the 
girls. The snake had been shot earlier that morning at the kennel. Senall, a 
veteran father, figured the sight of it would be worth a thousand warnings to 
children about running blithely off into the bushes alone. He was right. 
</P>
<P>
 Senall suggested we park our bags in our room, directing us down a walkway to 
the airy Gene Autry room, with a knotty-pine, open-beamed ceiling and a tub 
that would later prove a godsend for saddle sores. It's one of only five guest 
rooms here, all of which are clustered at the east end of the house. Ours was 
next to the Gabby Hayes room and across from John "The Duke" Wayne room, 
separated by a huge, round, tiled fountain. I could feel the urban uptightness 
loosen as I listened to its soothing, trickling sound. 
</P>
<P>
 We changed into jeans and boots, then headed to the "great room" in the ranch 
house to arrange a ride and baby-sitting for our preschooler. A couple of 
guests dressed in breeches and knee-high leather riding boots were seated on 
couches swapping horse tales about the morning hunt with our hostess, Joanne 
Senall. (The ranch lends its property to a local hunt club and in California 
style, the hounds chase coyotes, not foxes.) They could have stepped out of a 
Polo ad. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, I've been around all sorts of horsy types, from rough-and-tumble 
endurance riders who taught me to stay on a horse careening up and down 
mountain trails, to people who treated their animals as objets d'art. Some were 
the greatest people I've ever met, others have been among the snootiest. But as 
we were introduced around, not an upper lip curled, no eyebrow raised. Instead, 
we were greeted warmly by Joanne, who pulled us into conversations with 
strangers and urged us to nosh from a sideboard laden with crudites, 
strawberries and homemade sweets. 
</P>
<P>
 I stopped worrying and started enjoying myself as I surveyed the surroundings, 
a blend of Western ranch-house informality and understated elegance. The 
ceiling was decorated with a dried grapevine arrangement wound round exposed 
pine beams. Pastel-shaded dhurrie rugs blended with the floor's 
cinnamon-colored tile pavers. Antique furniture was mixed with rough-hewn 
tables supported on sanded and lacquered fence posts. Bronze horse sculptures 
frozen in various gates added a grace to the scene. An Italian silver chess set 
sat on a table in the reading area, the pieces cast as Roman and Egyptian horse 
soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 I met Jean, a good-humored woman who turned out to be our trail guide for the 
weekend. Would we like to go for a late-afternoon ride? The answer came from my 
daughter, who almost pulled her out the door. 
</P>
<P>
 We headed past the Olympic-size tiled swimming pool that Wayne had built when 
he owned the place, then down a short trail to the stable. Our horses were 
already saddled when we got there. Mine was Chuck, a bay gelding who had been a 
polo pony in a former life. As we set out at an easy pace toward an open field 
and past one of two dressage rings -- dressage is an equine version of 
classical ballet -- I quickly understood why polo ponies are so valuable. The 
lightest squeeze of the leg and Chuck picked up the pace. 
</P>
<P>
 My daughter, however, wasn't bonding with her mount, Alfie. We turned back 
and, much to Elizabeth's relief, left her off with Emma and Bonita, the baby 
sitter. 
</P>
<P>
 As we rode, Jean chatted about the ranch -- how the Senall's had bought the 
rundown property several years ago. They'd worked hard to turn it into an 
intimate affair that would appeal to all levels and styles of riding and 
stocked it with horses as comfortable at rounding up cattle as they were 
sailing over fences. Guests can book for the week, weekend or arrange to take 
part in a three-day mock cattle drive or sign up for individual lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 We came to a sandy stretch of trail and, with little urging, our mounts broke 
into a rocking-horse canter. The wind had died, the sun was low on the horizon 
and in the distance a spray of purple wild Canterbury bells covered the 
hillside. All I could hear was the rhythm of the horse's breathing as the 
ground turned to a blur underneath. At moments like that I'm convinced heaven 
has horses. 
</P>
<P>
 But paradise had to be postponed. It was getting dark and dinner was at 8. 
</P>
<P>
 The meal started with wine and conversation with the other guests, all of whom 
were regulars. Dain, who owns a design company, flies in from Chicago about 
once a month to stay here. Elizabeth from Santa Monica works with computers and 
comes here on weekends for dressage lessons. Her companion, Phillip, is a 
scientist and has caught horse fever too. As we ate the crisp multi-lettuce and 
vegetable salad, crunchy Italian bread and fluffy lasagna that Joanne had made, 
conversation thrived. We finally wound down over Joanne's berry cobbler topped 
with homemade ice cream.  
</P>
<P>
 We awoke to a heavy fog that ebbed and flowed in the valley. As we warmed up 
on mugs of hot, strong coffee and a full breakfast of bacon, eggs, cereal and 
muffins, we suddenly heard the hounds barking. Then through the fog we saw the 
scarlet jackets of a band of riders galloping along the ridge. This was the 
last hunt of the season, Joanne explained, and they'd be at this for a while. 
</P>
<P>
 My husband and I lingered over breakfast -- no one seems to be in a hurry at 
Pavoreal, which suited me fine -- then headed off for a morning ride with 
Phillip, with Jean as guide. Elizabeth was signed up for a safe ride in the 
arena with Joanne, and Emma stayed to play with Bonita. 
</P>
<P>
 Would we like to try our hand at cutting cattle? Jean asked. 
</P>
<P>
 We headed to a pasture where about 40 head were grazing. Today I was riding 
Phantom, an appaloosa originally trained as a cutting horse. To anyone 
expecting a lot of yippee-i-ki-yay, herding cows can be disappointing. It's 
best done quietly and skillfully; Phantom proved to be a master. 
</P>
<P>
 Then we set off for a brisk ride up a dusty ridge, then through a meadow of 
wildflowers. I looked over at Michael. He was grinning from ear to ear as the 
wind whipped across his face. I realized that I, too, was grinning like a kid. 
I kicked Phantom and raced ahead, sucking in the scent of dust, horse and wild 
sage. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd wager that if Wayne were around today and had been along with us on that 
ride, he too would have been grinning. Budget for Four

BOYS' BASKETBALL PREVIEW; HOOP DREAMS; WITH CRENSHAW LOSING CENTER TRAVIS REED, 
THE DOOR IS OPEN FOR MANUAL ARTS, DORSEY AND WASHINGTON TO MOVE IN AS THE TOP 
TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The divorce came suddenly -- Crenshaw center Travis Reed packed his bags and 
left. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars, winners of two consecutive State Division I titles, already had 
lost Tremaine Fowlkes, Kristaan Johnson, Reggie McFerren, Leon Watson and 
Tommie Davis to graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Reed. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his former team's success, Reed wanted to play basketball with his 
neighborhood friends and felt like an intruder at Crenshaw. He became the 
second Division I prospect to transfer f1919905056 "I didn't get along with the 
players," Reed said. "I don't want to say any more." 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw Coach Willie West wasn't pleased to lose a 6-foot, 7-inch junior 
center with growing potential. 
</P>
<P>
 "He never said anything to me," West said. "He wasn't mistreated. I have not 
received an explanation from him or his dad." 
</P>
<P>
 One only needs to follow Reed's size-16 footsteps to Manual Arts to know where 
the balance of power has shifted. The Cougars may have dominated California 
teams -- losing only one game to them in two season -- but now the door is open 
for Manual Arts, two-time 4-A runner-up Dorsey and perennial power Washington 
to move in as the City Section's top team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a pleasant surprise to see Travis knocking on my classroom door during 
the summer," Manual Arts Coach Randolph Simpson said. "His dad wanted him to go 
to A.B. Miller, but he burned up his car traveling to get there." 
</P>
<P>
 Manual Arts already had an outstanding starting lineup, including guards 
Darwin Carter and Charlie Parker, son of interim USC Coach Charlie Parker. The 
Toilers, however, were a perimeter shooting team, especially with the departure 
of 6-5 power forward David Rickenbacker to San Diego State. But with Reed 
stepping into the starting lineup, the Toilers have both inside and outside 
shooting threats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Travis is such an outstanding talent because he can make the 15- to 
18-footer," Simpson said. "He also has excellent post moves." 
</P>
<P>
 Opposing coaches often criticize West and his basketball program for the 
number of transfers who join his Crenshaw team. But West said he loses just as 
many players as he gains. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacque Vaughn, a point guard at Kansas, lived two blocks from Crenshaw High 
but attended high school at Muir in Pasadena. Vaughn, who is considered the top 
collegiate point guard in the nation, did not think he could make the Cougar 
starting lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Pierce, who was in West's sixth-period class as a sophomore, transferred 
back to Inglewood two years ago and is considered the top senior prospect in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't feel comfortable at Crenshaw after being with my friends at 
Inglewood," Pierce said. "The only player I knew was Tremaine (Fowlkes). I felt 
Inglewood was my home and I had to go back." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, Marcell Capers left Crenshaw after his sophomore season because he 
did not think he could be a varsity starter. Vincent Langston started ahead of 
Capers on the Cougars' junior varsity team. 
</P>
<P>
 Capers, who transferred to Manual Arts, scored 26 points as the Toilers 
defeated Crenshaw, 84-72, to win the 1990 City 4-A division title, their first 
since 1981. Capers is now the starting point guard for Arizona State and one of 
the assist leaders in the Pacific 10 conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars appear to be inexperienced, but they still remain one of the 
City's top teams. The starting lineup features 6-6 guard Ronnie Arch, 6-5 
transfer forward Corey Williams and 6-6 forward Raymond Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Simpson: "Crenshaw doesn't rebuild. They reload." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorsey has grown tired of the label "second best" and would love to upstage 
the Cougars in the Southern Pacific Conference. The Dons, two-time City 4-A 
runner-ups, are led by 6-6 forward Charles Johnson, 6-5 swingman Willie O'Neal 
and 6-3 guard Jason Howzell. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington turns away more talent than it keeps. The Generals, the last team 
to beat Crenshaw, feature 6-6 Robert Gordon-Lamar and 6-5 Daniel Moore. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southeastern Conference gave up its two league format and will play an 
extra round of intra-conference games. Fremont and Jordan appear to be the 
favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Southern Section, defending Division 4-A champion Verbum Dei hopes to 
make another champagne toast with Andre -- forwards Andre Larry and Andre Smith 
are two of the area's best shooters. But the Eagles' best player maybe 6-1 
guard Deon Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 With the departure of Toby Bailey to UCLA, Loyola will have to depend on 
Bailey's younger brother, Ryan (Moose) Bailey, to carry the team. Moose Bailey 
recently signed with Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some talented players may change schools, the schools with the best 
talent still remain in the Central City. Handicapping the Top 10 Teams

 After a third-place showing in the 4-A East Valley League last year, the 
Knights could have some success in a conference that now includes teams such as 
Bravo Medical, Downtown Business and Los Angeles Center for Enriched Studies. 
But only the first-place team will get a playoff berth. The Knights have good 
chemistry, depth and talent. But they are short and lack experience. Stanley 
Wright will be called on to step up and lead, Raphael to score.

 Former Highland Coach Mahan takes over for Jim Hall, now at Nordhoff. The 
Antelopes' roster is not set, because Mahan expects several football 
players--including Redick and Lewis--to come out for basketball. Glover, Kofoed 
and Pruitt are the senior leaders. Highland 03,17,08,07 1993-94 OVERALL LEAGUE

 Knight said Dedeaux is a sleeper who could become a very good player in 
college. Burrell is a solid medium-range player who could blossom into one of 
the area's top players by next season. The new coach is still teaching his 
system, so the team might start slowly. Littlerock 03,17,08,07 1993-94 OVERALL

 With George and Jefferson, the Lobos could be moving up. George averaged 18.4 
points and 8.3 rebounds and is Littlerock's best player. Jefferson, the point 
guard, averaged six points and three assists. Pitts, quick and an excellent 
shooter, also will play a big role. Palmdale 03,17,08,07 1993-94 OVERALL LEAGUE

 The two-time defending league champions advanced to the Division I-A

a reserve. A trio of transfers will help fill the gaps. Bell is from Simi 
Valley, Phillips from Littlerock and Carpenter from Inglewood. Quartz Hill

 Former Cleveland assistant Turner, 33, hopes to get the Hunters out of the 
basement while selling the idea that proper attitude wins games. "We lost a lot 
of close games last year, but we've got a lot of seniors and returning guys," 
he said. "We expect to win those close games this year. We're going to forget 
about last year. We've got a new attitude." Sylva averaged 9.5 points and 6.7 
rebounds last season. The Hunters will press on defense and and run the break.

 The Parrots are small, but Werner has never had a more-talented group. "I see 
us fighting for a league title," he said. "The concern is how well we play 
together. If we play as a team, we should have a successful season." Cerna, one 
of two returning starters, averaged 9.4 points and six rebounds last season. 
Gonzalez, the other returning starter, averaged nearly four assists a game.

 The Spartans could have the biggest lineup in the league and they shouldn't be 
at a disadvantage with a new coach. Three of the four Mid-Valley teams have new 
coaches. "It feels like I'm building from scratch; we don't even have uniforms 
or warmups," said Escoto, 28, a former Cleveland assistant. "But we're coming 
together." Sylmar will take advantage of its depth at the guard position by 
pressing and running. Van Nuys 03,14,08,07 1994 OVERALL LEAGUE PLACE 2-14 0-11

 After last season, nobody is afraid of the Wolves. But Van Nuys could improve 
if Birken, Hurdle and Longmire, a transfer from Cleveland, come together as a 
front line. Nakata, quick, tough and able to play both guard positions, is the 
most-impressive returner. He and Birken, both second-team all-league, will be 
counted on to score. Okui, a transfer from Monroe, and Hernandez will get lots 
of minutes. Kanemura, 27, was a seven-year volunteer assistant under Yutaka 
Shimizu at Kennedy. East Valley League

 The Lancers lost four players who averaged nine points or more a game. But 
leading scorer Ronald Patterson (13.7 ppg.) is back. Levine says Patterson 
could be the best scorer at Grant since Keith Weinstein, who was All-City 3-A 
in 1990. Donald Patterson, Ronald's brother who averaged 5.4 rebounds last 
year, has improved. But the Lancers have concerns in outside shooting, 
rebounding and depth. They will fast-break and play pressure defense. "We're 
going to have to get every single loose ball we can," Levine said. Monroe

 Height, quickness and team chemistry are pluses. One more ingredient is 
needed: toughness. The Vikings will have to be road warriors to be successful, 
because their gym won't be repaired from earthquake damage until February or 
March. Gone are Kenyatta Niles and Dante Holly, who combined for 31 points a 
game last year. Stiner averaged 17.7 points last season. Johnson and Robottem, 
a transfer from Faith Baptist, could blossom. North Hollywood 03,17,08,07

 Will the beat go on for North Hollywood, which is 154-56 through nine seasons 
under Miller? The Huskies took a big hit in scoring with the graduation of 
Damon Ollie (20 ppg.) and Fantasia Johnson (14.7), but Lee (17.7) is back and 
has already signed a letter of intent to Stanford. Miller is concerned that too 
many players will want their hands on the ball, however. "Getting along off and 
on the court is the biggest question mark about this team," he said. Reseda

 The Regents move into a new league with a new coach. The cupboard is bare for 
former Grant assistant Enowitz, 26, after the 1993-94 championship season. But 
he is high on Floyd, who can run the floor. Cook and Davarpanah, both good 
outside shooters, should help. Two starting positions are up for grabs. Hameed, 
a transfer from Palisades, could step up.

 Donovan hopes a year of experience will help the Valiants move up a couple of 
places in the standings but a lack of height makes the job difficult. "We

 Quarterman, who coached the junior varsity at Santa Monica two years ago, has 
never seen any of his players in a game situation. "I don't even know who

Matekel, Reyes and Faith Baptist transfer Gales (11.7 points a game) give the 
Guards experience to compete for a playoff spot.

 The Braves' back court is solid, with returning starters James (12 ppg) and LE 
Winter (8 ppg), who should carry the team in its first season since moving from 
the Valley Pac-8 Conference. Birmingham has good size in Petrovic and Redmond. 
Agajanian played sparingly last season but is improving and should see some

 Ruffin and Quinley are the team's top players. Ruffin probably will start at

he learns to work consistently, he'll be a world-beater," Whiting said. Joseph 
is an excellent point guard, and Hill is a swingman who can score in bunches.

 Crider faces many more questions than answers. The Cavaliers are loaded with

shooting range, as does Jamerson, the junior varsity's most valuable player.

 The Falcons, Division I-AA finalists last season, are ranked ninth in the 
state by Cal-Hi Sports. Jacobsen, who averaged 21 points last season, and 
Jacobson, who averaged 10 points and 12 rebounds, are enough to carry the team. 
Jacobsen has signed with USD and Jacobsen has signed with Navy. "We can score 
from a lot of different areas," Goffredo said. "I think the question marks are 
chemistry and defense." A better question mark: Who will finish second to 
Crescenta Valley? Glendale 03,17,08,12 1993-94 OVERALL LEAGUE PLACE 20-7 8-2

 The Dynamiters have a group of good-shooting newcomers. Fuller, who averaged 
11.5 points last season, is one of the area's best all-around players. 
Kurdoglanyan is an excellent long-distance shooter, who might emerge as the 
team's leading scorer. Farmer also can connect from long range. "We're gonna 
take more three-pointers than we ever have before," Davidson said. Glendale 
should be in the thick of a race that figures to include Crescenta Valley, 
Pasadena and Muir. Hoover 03,17,08,07 1993-94 OVERALL LEAGUE PLACE 8-16 1-9 6th

 It might be another long season. Clarke, who averaged 10 points last season, 
is the only returning player. But Hoover has a hang-tough side. The Tornadoes 
twice defeated Crescenta Valley last season and things looked encouraging in 
summer league. "We're a pretty good transition team," Kohlmeier said. "We've 
got some guys who can pass the ball up the floor."

 Oak Park is among the best teams in Ventura County and the team to beat in the 
Tri-Valley League. Williams, who averaged 16.2 points a game and was voted the 
league's most valuable player, sat out the playoffs last season because of 
mononucleosis. Still, the Eagles reached the Division IV-A quarterfinals for 
the second consecutive season. Creason, the team's other returning starter, led 
the county in assists (5.7 a game). Fillmore 03,17,08,12 1993-94 OVERALL LEAGUE

 Cummings, who averaged 4.6 assists at point guard, is the only returning

in this league." St. Bonaventure 03,17,08,12 1993-94 OVERALL LEAGUE PLACE 11-12

 Experience is in short supply, but the newcomers are talented and Groff 
figures to shuffle the lineup depending on whom the Seraphs match up against. 
"Flexibility should be a strength," he said. "We can be a good three-point 
shooting team or we can play power inside." Molina averaged 9.6 points and 3.5 
assists last season. Carr moved into a starting role late in the season.

 Although Buena is inexperienced, its junior varsity team was 23-1 last year. 
Shaw averaged 15 points and nine rebounds a game for the junior varsity. 
Jackson was that team's MVP, with 8 ppg and 14 rpg. Buena's strength is outside 
shooting. Tobias led the team in three-point baskets last year. Buena is 
expected to be the third-best team in the league, behind powerhouses Dos 
Pueblos and Santa Barbara. Hueneme 03,17,08,07 1993-94 OVERALL LEAGUE PLACE

 Jones is the only player with varsity experience. And more than half the team 
didn't play basketball at Hueneme last year. Davis is returning to coach after 
a one-year hiatus because of illness. With those changes, look for a different 
team this year. "People that saw us play and expect us to be the same are going 
to be quite surprised," Davis said. Still, they can probably hope for a 
third-place finish at best. Oxnard 03,17,08,07 1993-94 OVERALL LEAGUE PLACE

 The Yellowjackets could be in for a surprisingly good season, although they 
still are unlikely to crack the top two spots in the league. Lewis, Vaca and 
Glover were full-time starters and Phillips was a part-time starter. Lobo 
thinks his team has good outside shooting as well as quickness to play a 
full-court game. Sweeney, who would have played varsity last year if he hadn't 
transferred into school late, will start. Rio Mesa 03,17,08,10 1993-94 OVERALL

 Because the Spartans have no size, they will use a three-guard offense. Wolf, 
no relation to the coach, is the best player. The best hope for strength inside 
is Arneson, but he was injured during the last football game and may miss the 
start of the season. "This team has exceptional character," Wolf, the coach, 
said, "but we may just get pounded on the boards." Ventura 03,17,08,07 1993-94

 Of the top eight players, one played varsity last year, four played on the 
sophomore team and three played on the junior varsity. Ventura will be one of 
the few teams in the league running a half-court offense rather than an 
up-tempo, pressing game. Ventura will try to get the ball inside to Dixon and 
Lincoln. The Cougars could challenge for the fourth playoff spot.

 La Canada has a history of success. The Spartans have won seven consecutive 
league titles and have reached the semifinals each of the past three years. In 
1992, they won the Division III-A championship. Petit averaged 16 points a game 
and was All-Southern Section and Foley also is a returning starter. Lack of 
size could be a weakness. "But we shoot extremely well," Hofman said.

 The Mustangs start fresh every season because Kilpatrick is an L.A. County 
facility for juvenile offenders and players rarely stay longer than one year. 
"This team has meshed together quicker than any other year. They are very 
responsive considering most of them haven't played organized basketball," 
Fortes said. Freeman could become a dominant inside player. The Mustangs are

 The Knights will spend the first part of the season trying to find an identity 
as only two players with significant playing time return from last season. 
"This is not abnormal to have so many new players," Neville said. "The program 
feeds itself through the years." Brumpton and Lewis are likely starters from 
the junior varsity. The Knights should be fighting for a playoff spot. Village

 The Crusaders should repeat as league champions as all three starting guards 
return. Gustafson, the returning league MVP, and Hanson (15 ppg) are three-year 
starters and give Village Christian one of the best perimeter teams in the 
area. The inside game is still an area of concern as Sorenson lacks experience, 
but the Crusaders should have no trouble scoring. Gustafson (19.2 ppg) is the 
third-highest returning scorer among area teams and was All-Southern Section.

JAMES FLANIGAN: GATT REALITY CHECK IS DRAWN ON STRONG RESERVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's now likely that Congress will approve U.S. participation in an expanded 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade this week, backing developments in 
international law and commercial practice that the United States has fought 
long and hard to achieve. 
</P>
<P>
 By their actions, the House and Senate will boost international trade in 
services -- law, finance, engineering, education -- in which the United States 
leads the world. The trade vote also will protect intellectual property -- 
computer software, copyrights on films, videos and music -- in which, again, 
the United States leads the world. 
</P>
<P>
 And by its vote, Congress will ensure a widening and growing world economy and 
give a boost to the U.S. economy too. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet from all the misleading opposition to GATT by politicians and 
commentators, you'd think Congress was voting for bubonic plague. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics have depicted America in GATT as Gulliver among the Lilliputians, a 
pitiful helpless giant stung by darts from pygmies. Far from prospering, GATT 
opponents have said, Americans would be impoverished and turned into minions of 
a menacing world state.  
</P>
<P>
 It is a defeatist, sour vision of the world stemming either from lack of 
confidence in U.S. economic vitality or a misguided but historic feeling that 
Americans do better without foreign entanglements. 
</P>
<P>
 So it's time for a reality check. In fact, the United States now depends on 
international transactions for 25% of its annual economic activity, including 
$750 billion worth of exports of goods and services and income from overseas 
investments. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade is not a zero-sum game but a giant swap meet in which jobs at ports and 
airlines, stock exchanges, movie lots and Disneyland depend on America's 
interactions with other nations. The country cannot do without foreign 
entanglements. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's a fact to be celebrated, not feared. This is the world America has 
made over the 48 years since World War II, as its soldiers stood guard over 
countries trying to rebuild their economies and confronted states hostile to 
the world trading system. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a time of historic growth in international commerce, with 
merchandise trade multiplying tenfold to more than $7 trillion. That doesn't 
include trillions more in undercounted services and the products of modern 
entertainment, TV programs and movies. 
</P>
<P>
 The GATT, which began in 1947 with 23 nations pledging not to raise tariffs or 
keep out each other's goods, has been a foundation of that growth. Average 
tariffs have come down from 40% to 5% as the agreement itself has expanded to 
123 nations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It hasn't always been smooth sailing. Disputes in the GATT have been frequent 
-- nations used to fight wars over trade, after all -- with the United States 
complaining most often that poorer countries were taking advantage of Uncle 
Sam's big market but not opening up to U.S. goods. 
</P>
<P>
 So U.S. administrations for more than a decade have demanded a tough judicial 
body like the World Trade Organization that's created in the new GATT 
agreement. Ironically, critics have falsely charged WTO with undermining U.S. 
sovereignty, rousing constitutional scholar Robert Bork to restate publicly 
that "no international agreement" can override U.S. laws and causing the 
Clinton Administration to create a panel of U.S. judges to monitor WTO 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, why are Americans so uneasy? Partly it's that the world is shifting. 
The most dynamic market today is in East Asia, not America (although the two 
fastest growing economies, Brazil and Peru, are in Latin America). 
</P>
<P>
 The East Asian economies (Japan, China, Taiwan, South and North Korea, 
Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, the Philippines and Vietnam) now account for 
25% of the world's total economic output -- on a par with the United States -- 
and by the year 2000, Asia will account for one-third. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. merchandise trade across the Pacific, at $361 billion, is 50% larger than 
its transatlantic trade. For Europe, business with Asia is now larger than 
trade with America. And trade among the Asian nations themselves counts for 
more than trade with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But that's a dawn of opportunity, not grounds for regret. Just consider the 
prospects in China, a nation that needs almost everything. Zhou Wenzhong, the 
new, 49-year old Chinese consul general in Los Angeles, cites some figures: 
"The World Bank will lend China $15 billion in the next five years for 
investments in infrastructure projects, in energy and communications," says 
Zhou. "And China's government will invest 500 billion renminbi (U.S. $57 
billion) in infrastructure between now and the end of the century." 
</P>
<P>
 China won't develop without bumps along the way, but it's on the move. 
Modernization of agriculture has sent 60 million people -- more than the whole 
population of Britain or Italy -- off the land and into the cities looking for 
work. Even if it grows 7% a year -- as opposed to more than 10% today -- 
China's economy by 2010 will be 82% the size of the U.S. economy, which will 
itself continue growing in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
 The challenge for the United States and other countries will be to bring China 
into the GATT next year so that its potential to export surges of low-priced 
goods can be controlled and its enormous market will remain open, explains S. 
Linn Williams, a former U.S. trade representative who is now general counsel to 
Mission Energy, a subsidiary of Southern California Edison that builds and 
operates power plants in Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans have a big stake in China's development. U.S. firms will build many 
of its power plants and large parts of the communications and transportation 
systems, with every dollar of work over there creating several dollars worth of 
work back in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Trade often defies expectations. The U.S. telecommunications industry, for 
example, grew and prospered because the U.S. government broke up the telephone 
company and, in a move unlike that of any other country, opened the market to 
global suppliers. The resulting competition produced an industry that employs 
more people than ever and exports the latest in communications know-how all 
over the world -- notably to China. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Can the United States turn its back on the world? It did before, in 1930 when 
Congress raised tariffs and crop supports to protect U.S. farmers from cheap 
foreign crops. But the Smoot-Hawley tariff and foreign retaliation destroyed 
export markets for U.S. farmers while high prices hurt home markets and helped 
bring on the Great Depression. We can be thankful that probably won't happen 
again this week.

THE LAST FRONTIER; ON CIVIL RIGHS' CUTTING EDGE, GAY AND LESBIAN MANAGERS OFTEN 
FACE CHOICE BETWEEN OPENNESS AND AMBITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA K.H. WALTERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When "Julie" (not her real name) was "outed" by an employee who wanted to 
sabotage her management career, her company stood by her. Later, though, when 
she became more active and visible in lesbian interests, the same company 
warned her "to pull back in." 
</P>
<P>
 "Hints were given to me," she said. "If I wanted to advance, I'd have to toe 
the line a little more." 
</P>
<P>
 For gay men and lesbians, the world of corporate management is fraught with 
peril and mixed messages. They know full well that in many companies, even 
those with non-discrimination policies, something that ideally shouldn't matter 
in the workplace -- sexual orientation -- often does. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the ranks of middle managers -- where a surfeit of baby boomers jostle 
for a few spaces in the executive suite -- every mark, good or bad, counts. The 
conundrum for gay managers is whether being gay and out of the closet would be 
the one demerit that would knock them out of contention, or even out of the job 
they already have. 
</P>
<P>
 From leaders of the gay rights movement they hear urgings not just to come 
out, but also to serve as role models for other gays and use their management 
positions to press for gay-friendly social and employment policies, such as 
marriage equivalency and domestic partner benefits. At work, they notice that 
being part of a minority group often means getting trapped below the "glass 
ceiling." They look above them and see no, or few, openly gay people in the 
executive ranks. And within, they feel a yearning to shed the ruses and the 
anxiety they bring. 
</P>
<P>
 Gays are largely alone in wrestling with their dilemmas. So far, big business 
has virtually ignored the problems gays face in management and executive 
positions. Homosexuals often miss out on benefits others may derive from 
affirmative action programs and diversity efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of sexual orientation, one of the final frontiers in the American 
civil rights movement, is further complicated by the religious beliefs of some 
and the sexual insecurity of many. Indeed, there continues to be contentious 
national debate about whether gays even have rights, or whether their rights 
ought to be protected. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gay men and lesbian managers say they are sensitive to negative stereotypes of 
homosexuals as sexual predators. 
</P>
<P>
 Those whose sexual orientation is known by their peers and superiors say they 
are constantly measuring their decisions against an unspoken and often 
indefinable standard of behavior. They are hesitant to hire what others might 
count as "too many" other gays -- or even members of the same sex -- of being a 
mentor to other gays and of pressing gay issues. The gays they do hire are 
often held to higher standards than straight employees, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gay community is sensitive to the perception we're going to inundate some 
place, that we will hire only gay people right and left and flood the company 
with gays," said a lesbian entrepreneur who is active in Bay Area Career Women, 
a Northern California group that is the largest organization for lesbians in 
the country. "And we're also sensitive to the perception we might try to use 
undue influence on our employees. . . . We can do nothing that can be perceived 
as an impropriety." 
</P>
<P>
 At Federal Express' Los Angeles station, manager Nora Rooney was accused of 
having a romantic interest in women whom she hired or promoted. And, according 
to a job discrimination suit she has filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, 
because she was a lesbian, "any woman she hired was also suspected to be a 
lesbian." 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Chmaj, a bank vice president in Northern California, is "sensitive about 
making remarks about how someone looks . . . and I probably would hesitate more 
with women than with men. Everybody these days is being careful about office 
conduct," to not cross the line into sexual harassment, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I feel I'm definitely pressured not to say anything. You don't want people to 
even dream about (a compliment) meaning something sexual." 
</P>
<P>
 Chmaj, like many gays, would prefer that her sexual orientation not be a 
workplace issue at all. But even for gays who are out and feel comfortable in 
their jobs, as she does, there are "still things you dance around every day." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other groups that face discrimination -- including racial minorities 
and women -- gays generally can choose whether -- and to whom -- to reveal 
their identity as a member of a minority. 
</P>
<P>
 The choice was taken from Julie. But, like gay men and lesbians scattered 
throughout the management ranks of the country's biggest businesses, she too 
had to figure out, with little guidance, how much gayness was "too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Many figure that any is too much, and so they stay in the closet. 
</P>
<P>
 A San Francisco lesbian who was closeted as she rose steadily through the 
ranks of her technology company to become vice president for human resources 
said she "thought it would be the end of my career if I came out." 
</P>
<P>
 "As a vice president," she said, "I was concerned about what risks I would be 
taking for my career. But also, I was establishing policy, writing policy 
manuals, trying to get partners' benefits (for unmarried couples). I didn't 
want anyone to argue that I was fighting for this because I was a lesbian. I 
wanted them to see that these policies made good business sense, so that when I 
left, they would still hold on to those policies." 
</P>
<P>
 The question of whether to acknowledge their sexual orientation bedevils gays 
of every rank and position. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vast majority of gays and lesbians are still closeted in the workplace, 
and that's especially true of managers," said Richard Jennings, executive 
director of Hollywood Supports, an organization formed in 1991 to smooth the 
path for gays in the entertainment industry and to offer diversity training 
that includes sexual orientation issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The kind of seminar offered by Hollywood Supports is a rarity. Most diversity 
training programs have yet to identify gays as a group with special needs and 
sensitivities. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you were to survey the human resources profession, in all probability they 
would not raise any overt concern regarding involvement of gays and lesbians in 
the workplace," said Art Hershey, vice president of the Professionals in Human 
Resources Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Many gays report that coming out in the workplace was far less difficult than 
they had imagined. Yet fear of revealing their sexual orientation is still the 
greatest problem shared by gays in the workplace, said Maureen S. O'Leary, an 
Oakland resident who is co-chair of Global, a U.S. and Canadian association of 
gay and lesbian organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Leroy Aarons, former executive editor of the Oakland Tribune and founder and 
president of the National Lesbian and Gay Journalists Assn., recalls that while 
he was a reporter at the Washington Post in the 1960s, he never came out at 
work.  
</P>
<P>
 "At that stage of my life," he said, "I was convinced it would do nothing but 
harm my career in a very competitive environment where every factor plays a 
role." 
</P>
<P>
 He was warned to be discreet, he said, by one of the paper's managers who had 
seen him go into a gay bar. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gays are more vulnerable to discrimination in the workplace than other 
minorities and women. In all but eight states -- one of them California -- and 
about 115 municipalities, it is still not illegal to discriminate on the basis 
of sexual orientation. Several states and cities, in fact, have either enacted 
or are considering laws that specifically deny homosexuals protection against 
discrimination. (Two such measures, in Oregon and Idaho, were defeated in this 
month's elections.) 
</P>
<P>
 Many employers still "think it's a God-given right to discriminate based on 
sexual orientation, just like it was once thought to be a God-given right to 
discriminate based on gender," said Daniel Stormer, a partner in the Los 
Angeles law firm Hadsell & Stormer who specializes in employment 
discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Jean M. O'Leary, a lesbian activist and Democratic Party consultant (no 
relation to Maureen O'Leary), recalled the time many years ago when she wanted 
to get into a real estate field dominated in the Los Angeles area by two 
companies. When she applied at the first company, she said, "I absolutely felt 
like I needed to tell them" she was a lesbian, "so it wouldn't come as a 
surprise later when I got phone calls at work" related to her activism. 
</P>
<P>
 "They never hired me. I'm sure that's why," she said. She went to the other 
main player, didn't raise the issue and was hired. 
</P>
<P>
 Many gays choose secrecy and obfuscation -- even the cover of heterosexual 
relationships -- over derision, rejection or more subtle forms of prejudice. 
Gays in middle management today share the belief that in the past, the only way 
gays climbed the ladder of success to upper-management rungs was in disguise. 
Once there, few gays choose to come out, perhaps because they have more to 
lose. 
</P>
<P>
 Gay managers say if they suspect, or are certain, that some of their senior 
executives are gay, they step gingerly around the issue. A gay junior executive 
in a conservative company said he was fairly certain a senior executive was 
also gay, but he was careful to respect his privacy, especially because he, 
too, was still closeted. 
</P>
<P>
 Wary gays take their cues from the subtle signs around them, and the dearth of 
visible role models is an important factor. Homosexuals tell Global they are 
often uncertain of support in their company because "it's hard to tell whether 
there are any people in senior management positions who are gay," Maureen 
O'Leary said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are so few prominent, openly gay executives at large companies that the 
same names are mentioned over and over again, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Soon there will be one fewer. Elizabeth Birch, worldwide director of 
litigation for Apple Computer Inc. in Cupertino, will be leaving the company 
next month to become executive director of the Human Rights Campaign Fund, the 
country's largest political organization for gays. As the highest-ranking 
lesbian at the company, the spotlight has turned her way often.  
</P>
<P>
 Staying closeted puts tremendous pressure on gays in middle management, 
supervisorial and higher-ranking positions. Julie described her work life 
before being outed as "walking a tightrope." 
</P>
<P>
 One woman found it too draining to remain closeted in a managerial role. "The 
more I come out in my life in general," she said, "the harder it is to be 
closeted at work. It takes enormous energy to live your life the rest of the 
day, then not live it at work, where you have to be conscious of everything you 
say, to not give it away." 
</P>
<P>
 Lesbians can feel especially vulnerable to bias. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women are still in a precarious place management-wise. Being a woman, you've 
already got one strike against you," said the lesbian active in Bay Area Career 
Women. "If you come out as a lesbian, it's a second big strike against you. 
It's real scary. Lesbians say: 'I'm barely here because I'm a woman, and for me 
to come out is a real risk and one I'm not willing to take. I'll deal with a 
double life.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Edward (Ted) Liebst, now a partner in Media Connections Group, a San Francisco 
company that provides consulting to the telecommunications industry, was very 
nearly leading a double life during his years in investment banking. He was a 
vice president, wasn't out and, while he didn't want to lie about being gay, 
"if someone drew a conclusion that deferred the issue or dismissed it, I chose 
to let them believe what they wanted to believe." 
</P>
<P>
 For managers, the coming out process is renewed with every new employee, or 
every new project that involves people outside their department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the most visible lesbian in America for a few years; the first lesbian 
this, the first lesbian that," Jean O'Leary said. "But I'm still coming out. 
It's a constant process. You don't just come out to stay. You have to tell 
somebody (new) that you are gay, and it's a very personal thing -- like, to 
drop into a casual conversation that you have a lover and it's a woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Gay managers also worry that their sexual orientation might cause their 
company to lose business, or that normally supportive bosses will flinch at 
having the company's name associated with gay events or public discussion of 
homosexual issues.  
</P>
<P>
 Birch has done "tons of gay work" while on Apple's payroll, and she said her 
staff and superiors were supportive. Nevertheless, when the company hit busy 
periods, she worried that company executives would consider her activism "a 
distraction." 
</P>
<P>
 Job transfers -- often a prerequisite for climbing the corporate ladder -- 
pose a particularly sticky problem for gay managers. 
</P>
<P>
 If the employee has a partner, that partner faces loss of his or her job and 
fringe benefits, almost always without the support an organization might 
provide a relocating dual-career heterosexual couple. Also, gays have an added 
criterion -- often their primary one -- when considering relocation: Does the 
region have a strong gay community, or will he or she be forced to live in a 
straight culture and face discrimination, gay-bashing or loneliness?  
</P>
<P>
 And gay managers worry about their opportunities to rise further. 
</P>
<P>
 Liebst of Media Communications said that in conservative banking circles, "if 
you are a vice president with expectations and hopes of being senior vice 
president, there's a certain amount of socialization that occurs. You're 
expected to participate in social functions. . . . I believed at some point my 
career would stop, I would hit a ceiling. I couldn't have chosen (the 
management track) because I couldn't have passed that part of the test. Right 
or wrong, I believed I wouldn't be able to get to that next step," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven P. Neiffer, who is a vice president at a Pasadena-based bank, agrees. 
His colleagues know his sexual orientation, and it hasn't seemed to stand in 
his way. Even so, he said, "there is an easiness between people in senior 
management in situations where they can involve spouses that is difficult to 
know how to deal with in my situation. There's a lot of discomfort in regularly 
socializing with my superiors (or) the bank directors." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, gays who tire of discrimination or of feeling that they must 
lead a double life are taking an escape route that has been dubbed 
"entrepreneurial flight." 
</P>
<P>
 One lesbian who "bailed out of corporate life" said that "there's a high 
preponderance of gay people who create their own jobs. They find a tremendous 
amount of freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 Said activist Jean O'Leary: "What I have done all my life is to create my own 
environment where I could be comfortable." She left real estate and now runs 
her own company, Print-tec Industries, a North Hollywood company that markets 
computer supplies.  
</P>
<P>
 She said she isn't concerned whether or how her employees learn that she is a 
lesbian. "I don't pay attention to the whole thing. I get to do that because 
I'm the boss. Instead, I worry that they are happy and satisfied in their own 
jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Another lesbian, whose last job was as vice president for a large corporation, 
said she's ready to leave corporate life and the closet. She's looking for a 
business to buy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figure this way," she said, "I can be out, own my own business, run my own 
show, have all the control and freedom I want."

TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS: INSIGHT; THERE'S OPPORTUNITY FOR U.S. AS LATIN TRADE 
BARRIERS FALL AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSE DE LA TORRE, JOSE DE LA TORRE is a professor of international business 
strategy in UCLA's Anderson Graduate School of Management and director of the 
university's Center for International Business Education and Research. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With crucial votes scheduled in Congress this week on the GATT world trade 
agreement, Capitol Hill's new Republican leaders -- emboldened by their 
election victory -- are sounding more and more like their predecessors of the 
late 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, as now, a Republican Congress faced an unpopular Democratic President. 
Then, as now, long and arduous negotiations had led to the signing of an 
ambitious world agreement that would slash barriers to trade in goods and 
services, promote international investment and safeguard intellectual property 
rights. Then, as now, the agreement called for international arbitration 
procedures with real teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, as now, a coalition of conservative Democrats and Republicans 
rallied against any abdication of American sovereignty, providing a useful flag 
in which to wrap special interests clamoring for protection. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1950, President Harry S. Truman gave in to the conservative coalition, 
dropping the Havana Charter and its promise of a new international trade 
organization. This week, by contrast, President Clinton seems likely to win 
approval of GATT. The price for incoming Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole's 
support: Creation of a judicial panel empowered to monitor decisions taken by 
the new World Trade Organization (scheduled to replace the GATT on Jan. 1) and 
recommend withdrawal if it rules too often against U.S. interests. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, the Democratic President is simply picking up where Republicans 
left off in pursuing free trade. Fresh from his success in Indonesia, where the 
President won a commitment from the nations of the Pacific Basin to eliminate 
trade barriers by 2020, Clinton heads in two weeks to Miami for a summit with 
Latin American heads of state. There, the United States will face increasing 
pressure to make good on President George Bush's promise of a free trade zone 
stretching from Alaska to Tierra del Fuego. 
</P>
<P>
 The region's transformation has been startling since the debt crisis of 1982 
and the subsequent collapse in living standards and business activity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The old order of import protection and government-led industrialization has 
fallen away. In its place came a new order characterized by fiscal discipline, 
falling trade barriers (tariff rates dropped from an average of nearly 50% in 
1985 to about 15% by 1992), big privatizations and deregulation of foreign 
exchange markets and direct foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
 The results have been dramatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Chile, which led the process under Gen. Augusto Pinochet's regime, has 
experienced sustained growth of more than 6% in recent years, with inflation 
down to single digits by 1994. The successful transition to democracy has added 
new vigor to the economy and to the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
 President Carlos Menem's government in Argentina overcame a history of 
ineffective reforms and saw inflation reduced from 5,000% in 1989 to 4% this 
year. Growth has been dynamic, exceeding 8% in the first half of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil has had seven finance ministers, three currencies and two economic 
shock treatments in the last four years. But now, with the imposition of the 
"real" plan and the election of its author, Fernando Cardoso, to the 
presidency, the country seems poised to fulfill its role as the engine of Latin 
American growth. Inflation dropped from more than 50% in June to less than 1% 
in September. Economic growth is expected to boom to the 7% to 8% range for the 
rest of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 There are, of course, exceptions. Venezuela represents the worst-case 
scenario. After a short-lived reform process, the country is now retreating 
under the leadership of a populist government modeled after the old order. A 
severe banking crisis has caused the government to reinstate exchange controls 
and increase the public deficit to more than 18% of gross domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the prospects for the region have not been brighter in decades. 
Improvements in productivity augur well for the competitiveness of local 
industries, particularly in sectors such as steel, automobiles and mining. And 
a spate of regional free trade pacts has added fuel and discipline to the 
liberalization process: 
</P>
<P>
 * Following the signing of NAFTA, Mexico has joined in bilateral free-trade 
agreements with Chile and Costa Rica. Two-way trade between Colombia and 
Venezuela has doubled since they signed a customs agreement in 1992. And in 
June of this year, the two joined Mexico to form the "G-3" duty-free area, 
pledging to liberalize most trade among them. 
</P>
<P>
 * After languishing in the 1980s, the Andean Pact -- linking Colombia, 
Venezuela, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia -- has markedly lowered barriers to trade 
and investment in the last five years. Beginning in January, it will become a 
common tariff and customs union, providing uniform treatment to all foreign 
investors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Since Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay created the Mercosur free 
trade area in 1991, their internal trade has nearly tripled to about $12 
billion this year. By Jan. 1, this group, too, will enter into a customs union 
with common external tariffs and a renewed commitment to integration into the 
world economy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 All of this is good news for American business. U.S. exports to the region 
have more than doubled since 1987, to more than $80 billion last year. And U.S. 
firms have been active in investing in these growth markets, pouring in more 
than $25 billion in the last five years. It would be a great shame if a new 
provincialism in Washington means that all this progress is met with an 
excessively cautious approach in Miami next month.

NO MERE FLIGHT OF FANCY; MALL-STYLE RETAILING HELPS AIRPORTS LAND NEW INCOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 With more than 800 flights to and from Sacramento under his belt, Assemblyman 
Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) has encountered more than his share of 
second-rate airport food. 
</P>
<P>
 "You were sure the Sacramento airport was open 24 hours a day because whatever 
it was that they were serving you looked like it was 24 hours old," he said. 
"You slid your tray down the line, they'd give you something, and you'd wonder 
what it was. My advice for most airports is: Don't eat." 
</P>
<P>
 The politician's ruminations will ring true for frequent fliers who have 
braved an airport cafeteria line -- or paid too much for a paperback novel at 
an airport newsstand as well. 
</P>
<P>
 But poor food and overpriced souvenir stands gradually are giving way to 
attractively decorated restaurant and retail operations that use competitive 
pricing and service to win sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Changes are being driven by the growing realization that travelers generally 
have both time and money on their hands, a combination that's "the magic 
formula for retailing," according to Monica Nassif, a spokeswoman for 
Miami-based Sun Glass Hut, which operates 11 stores at airports. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport executives and retailers say that truly competitive pricing is the key 
to success. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other day at an airport I paid $2.75 for a Whopper that I'd only pay 99 
cents for at a Burger King restaurant," said Mike Epstein, marketing vice 
president for San Diego-based Creative Croissants, which operates a coffee 
stand at John Wayne Airport. "That's why airports are starting to go to street 
pricing. Customers won't stand for (high prices) anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh's innovative "air mall" is the acknowledged leader in airport 
retail operations. The 2-year-old terminal is home to more than 80 restaurants 
and retail shops, including TGI Fridays, Nature Company, the Body Shop, Upper 
Deck Authenticated and Sun Glass Hut. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh officials offer a simple measure of the mall's success: Sales per 
boarded passenger have soared to nearly $7, up from just $2.40 per visit before 
the new airport terminal opened. 
</P>
<P>
 Another gauge of its popularity is that up to 5% of monthly sales at the 
airport mall go to local residents who view the airport as an alternate 
shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh's successful experiment with "street pricing" has prompted the 
Dallas-Fort Worth airport and others to adopt rules that require retailers and 
restaurants to charge prices equivalent to those at off-airport sites. But Los 
Angeles International Airport is instead banking on competition to keep prices 
low when its new culinary lineup is completed in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 And competition for Los Angeles airport's retail slots has been fierce. 
Hundreds of restaurant operators and food companies, including Wolfgang Puck, 
Kentucky Fried Chicken, Creative Croissants, Panda Express and Haagen-Dazs, 
responded last spring when the airport announced that it would revitalize its 
restaurants through competitive bidding. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport operators expect the revamped restaurant operation to dramatically 
increase the amount of revenue that flows to LAX. At present, food and beverage 
operations generate about $50 million in gross revenue, and operators pass 
through about $6 million in payments to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 LAX wants to create a blend of national brand names and local favorites that 
will provide "a real reflection of Los Angeles," said airport contracts manager 
Ramon Olivares. The airport, which earlier revamped its retail operations, will 
start to unveil its new list of restaurant and kiosk operators early next year, 
and travelers should notice a dramatic change by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the Dallas-Fort Worth airport is sorting through a short list of 
150 companies that want to operate restaurants and shops at the Texas airport. 
In a hint of what's to come, one concessionaire has opened a small retail court 
featuring the best of Sharper Image, Christian Dior and Timberland. 
</P>
<P>
 Some older airports won't easily lend themselves to increased retail 
operations. Pittsburgh's new terminal owes much of its success to its design -- 
passengers are funneled through its centrally located mall, an option that's 
typically not available to older airports. 
</P>
<P>
 And airports must tackle the thorny question of leasing costs before opting 
for street pricing. If lease rates are too high, product prices often follow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Airport rentals are coming down, but they're still three times what the 
normal mall retailer pays," said Gregg Paradies, vice president and co-owner of 
Atlanta-based Paradies Shops, which operates the Dallas retail court as well as 
shops at John Wayne and Burbank airports. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But when it's possible to make the change, the mall-like approach can be a 
godsend for cash-strapped airport operators who collect fees from restaurants 
and retailers. "This is all new dollars being spent," said Lowry Davison, 
director of commercial development at Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport. 
"People have the money and they're willing to spend it, given the chance." 
</P>
<P>
 What is attracting retailers and restaurants to airports is that travelers 
generally have money. 
</P>
<P>
 Host Marriott in Bethesda, Md., which operates in nearly 80 airports, reports 
that the average traveler spends about an hour in airports before and after 
flights. That traveler's $65,000 average annual income exceeds the average 
mall-goer's. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a captive audience in the true sense of the word," said Bruce Schroder, 
a vice president at Irvine-based Taco Bell, which operates restaurants and 
snack bars in about 40 airports. "And travelers tend to be higher-income people 
for whom price is not as much of an issue." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While McDonald's, Taco Bell and Burger King are increasingly common at 
airports, operators now are seasoning the restaurant mix with lesser-known, 
regional favorites. Boston's Logan Airport features Legal Seafoods, and Host 
Marriott has invited Wild Goose Ale House, a popular brew pub in the Northwest, 
to operate restaurants on the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest wave in restaurant and retail development has debunked the "old 
theory that (travelers) will buy whatever it was you decided to put on the 
shelves," Paradies said. Travelers will always buy toothbrushes, newspapers, 
cigarettes and souvenirs, Paradies said. But, given the chance, they'll also 
buy much more. Sharper Image's airport shop at DFW in Dallas has sold a handful 
of massage chairs -- hefty pieces of furniture that retail for $2,895. 
</P>
<P>
 Charley Shin, a Columbus, Ohio, businessman who's eaten his fair share of 
really bad airport food, also views airports' retail areas as potentially 
lucrative opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Any initial doubts that Shin had about opening a Charley's Steakery in 
Pittsburgh's air mall disappeared after the restaurant blossomed into one of 
his 30-unit chain's top performers. Shin reports another plus: Airport 
locations are giving his chain "the high visibility and instant credibility" 
needed to expand into highly competitive markets, such as Southern California, 
where he operates just one restaurant, at Westminster Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The new approach of multiple, brand-name retailers and local favorites is a 
far cry from the days when airport operators awarded contracts to a single, 
large concessionaire. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the old days, it wasn't a bad idea to have one commissary take care of the 
whole airport," said Tarun Kapoor, a Cal Poly Pomona professor who studies the 
hospitality industry. "Having a single operator made it possible to make sure 
there's a bar in every part of the terminal, but it ignores what the public 
really wants now." 
</P>
<P>
 "Slowly," Kapoor said, "the institutional mind-set of airport food service is 
giving way to something that's much more sophisticated." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 American airports are now taking a page from their European counterparts, 
particularly English airfields "which are something of a department store," 
Lowry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport operators in the United States don't expect to steal great numbers of 
shoppers from malls because airports typically aren't located in heavily 
populated neighborhoods and usually charge high fees for parking. 
</P>
<P>
 A good chunk of spending at airports goes for impulse purchases, a fact that's 
not lost on vendors of high-priced sports memorabilia. The National Football 
League and the Professional Golf Assn. are opening sports-oriented airport 
shops that will cater to affluent male business travelers. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlsbad-based Upper Deck Authenticated, the sports souvenir retailer, is 
counting on spontaneous purchases at a shop it opened a year ago in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like the perfect place to be," said spokesman Camron Bussard. 
"Airports haven't been a venue for us in the past, but when you look at the 
amount of traffic, it's a good opportunity, and we're looking at other 
locations." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the flurry of activity nationwide, croissants, Starbucks coffee and 
designer yogurt are the exception rather than the rule, particularly at smaller 
airports. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cafeteria line is still the most common approach," Kapoor said. "And then 
you've got the places . . . where they have the traditional hot dog and potato 
chips . . . what I call the cholesterol diet."

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: SEASONAL FACTORS COULD SIGNAL PROFITABLE 1995 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People naturally grow hopeful about their investments as one year winds down 
and a new one approaches. This time around, there actually may be some theories 
to justify such optimism. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of interesting seasonal factors are converging in 1995 that could 
make the year a profitable one for stock-fund investors. Such factors don't 
work perfectly, of course, but their track records over time have been 
impressive -- and fun to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 If history repeats, expect the market to rise for the following reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 * The last digit of 1995 is a 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Goofy as it sounds, the stock market has shown a strong tendency to rally 
during the middle of each decade -- years such as 1975 and 1985. In fact, the 
Dow Jones industrial average has advanced in every mid-decade year from 1885 
on, reports Marshal Acuff, investment strategist for Smith Barney in New York.  
</P>
<P>
 Results since the early part of this century have been especially impressive. 
Large stocks, as represented by the Standard & Poor's 500 index, returned 31% 
or more in 1935, 1945, 1955, 1975 and 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 They gained only 12% in 1965, but small stocks surged 42% that year, reports 
Ibbotson Associates of Chicago. Small companies advanced at least 20% in each 
of those other decade midpoints starting in 1935.  
</P>
<P>
 If you had to pick a single year in each decade in which to invest, those 
ending with 5 would be best, followed by years ending in 8. The toughest times 
were those years ending in 7. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Presidential election cycle turns favorable. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks don't fare so well in the two years following a Presidential election, 
but they often sizzle in the two years preceding a vote.  
</P>
<P>
 The explanation: "Each administration usually does everything in its power to 
juice up the economy so that voters are in a positive mood at election time," 
argues Yale Hirsch of the Hirsch Organization in Old Tappan, N.J. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, that involves White House attempts to boost federal spending to 
ensure the that economy is on an upswing, Acuff says. 
</P>
<P>
 There might also be a psychological letdown among the electorate following a 
Presidential vote when people realize promises won't be fulfilled, says John 
Wyzkiewicz, an Ibbotson consultant. Conversely, during the two years leading up 
to Presidential balloting, investors get excited again about the prospect of a 
new administration and change, he reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, years that immediately precede an election year have been the best of 
all. Starting in 1943, stocks have advanced at least 5% in every such period -- 
a string of 13 in a row, according to Ibbotson data. What's more, 11 of the 13 
have been double-digit gainers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Small stocks turn up at year end. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares of smaller, thinly traded companies tend to rally after Christmas and 
continue climbing several weeks into the new year -- the "January effect." This 
doesn't imply that 1995 will be strong overall, but it does suggest that small 
stocks will start the year on a sound footing. 
</P>
<P>
 The most common rationale for the January effect is that tax-related selling 
in November and December acts to depress prices temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 But there may be other explanations, such as a rise in confidence around New 
Year's Day that makes people more comfortable investing in smaller companies. 
Another possibility: Obscure firms may release more financial data around the 
start of the year and thus generate more enthusiasm among investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are problems with each of these theories, but clearly the effect has 
some statistical substance to it," says Lance James, portfolio manager of 
Babson Enterprise II, a small-stock fund headquartered in Kansas City, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
 A January effect is also seen in other countries, which adds to the mystique 
of the phenomenon since tax laws differ around the world, says Wyzkiewicz. 
</P>
<P>
 Small U.S. companies historically have returned about 6.9% in January, by far 
their best month, according to Ibbotson data. That compares with January gains 
of about 1.6% for the largest U.S. corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, smaller companies are enjoying improved sales and profitability, 
yet their share valuations remain modest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still confident they will outperform the larger stocks next year," 
James says. 
</P>
<P>
 To the above three seasonal factors can be added several other anomalies -- 
from bad months for the stock market (September and October, for example) to 
bad days (Monday). You might want to adjust your holdings a bit in anticipation 
of some of the more dominant themes -- such as the market's tendency to rise in 
the year preceding an election year. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wouldn't be wise to make drastic shifts in your allocations, as doing 
so could be a dangerous exercise in market timing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Women are more conservative investors than men and would likely cut their 
losses faster, suggests a recent survey of 300 fund shareholders by Aetna 
Mutual Funds of Hartford, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Women appear to be less likely to stick with a long-term investment if it's 
losing money," says Judith Bramson, an Aetna vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey indicated that women are more bearish about the short-term growth 
prospects of their fund holdings and are less likely to own foreign 
investments. But they also are more likely to seek help from a professional 
adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 Among men, 58% said they gleaned financial information from magazines and 
newspapers, but only 32% of women did. 
</P>

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: MONITOR YOUR MORTGAGE PAYMENTS FOR ERRORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF

<P>
 Homeowners beware. 
</P>
<P>
 Rapidly rising interest rates have dramatically boosted the popularity of 
comparatively inexpensive adjustable-rate mortgages. However, some maintain 
that these loans are prone to error. Unwary homeowners could find themselves 
paying hundreds -- even thousands -- of dollars too much for their home 
mortgages as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 "People tend to just trust the bank," says Lawrence D. Powers, president of 
Consumer Loan Advocates, a nonprofit bank watchdog group in Lake Bluff, Ill. 
"They're often dealing with big-name companies, and they just assume those 
companies are going to be right." 
</P>
<P>
 However, with an adjustable mortgage, that could be an expensive mistake. 
Industry experts variously estimate that anywhere between a tenth and half of 
all adjustable loans contain errors. These errors, which typically crop up 
after the loan's interest rate has been adjusted a few times, are 
disproportionately likely to be in the bank's favor, Powers adds. The result is 
that, over the six-year life of the average loan, a homeowner could pay roughly 
$1,588 too much, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Some bankers say these problems are exaggerated. Admittedly, loan adjustment 
problems were so pervasive in the early 1990s that banking regulators sent out 
rafts of memos warning banks and thrifts to get their loan portfolios in order. 
But now many banks have straightened up, putting in tighter controls to ensure 
that fewer mistakes are made, bankers say. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, not all banks have made progress, Powers notes.  
</P>
<P>
 And even those that have been aggressive about trying to root out problems 
still find an occasional error, acknowledges Colleen Hamm, vice president of 
service operations at Great Western Bank in Los Angeles. Notably, few attribute 
the errors to malfeasance. Instead, both bankers and consumer advocates 
maintain that errors are simply the natural result of having a wide variety of 
adjustable loan products all hooked into the same computer systems. In some 
cases, a single missed keystroke can cause the loan's interest rate to be 
adjusted incorrectly, costing the borrower -- or the bank -- hundreds of 
dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Because mortgages are frequently a family's biggest annual expense, consumers 
would be wise to monitor their loans, Hamm says.  
</P>
<P>
 Now as Americans become increasingly dependent on adjustable mortgages, 
policing your mortgage is more important than ever. ARMs now account for 43% of 
all loans written, compared to just 16% a year ago, according to the Federal 
National Mortgage Assn. in Washington. Based on current loan originations, the 
ARM share will continue to rise, bankers say. 
</P>
<P>
 A variety of companies have sprung up recently to help individuals check the 
accuracy of their ARM loans. If the company finds an error in your favor, it 
typically charges you a commission that can amount to 50% of the error amount. 
In other words, if the bank has overcharged you $1,000, the ARM investigation 
firm would take $500 and you'd take $500. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 However, if you're willing to spend some time at it and know what to look for, 
you can police your own loan. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because there are only a handful of likely errors: Your bank can 
miscalculate the interest rate or payment when the loan is adjusted. Or it can 
miscalculate the remaining amount due. Studies have shown that nearly 
two-thirds ofthe errors involve interest calculations. A little less than a 
third of the errors involve miscalculating the balance due. Problems with 
miscalculated payment amounts are the third possible, and rarest, mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you monitor the loan? If you're smart, you start when you're picking 
out a mortgage. If you're shopping for an adjustable, you know there is a wide 
variety to choose from -- loans that adjust monthly, annually, twice-annually 
and in two- and five-year increments. Loans can be tied to Treasury bill rates, 
cost-of-fund indexes, certificate of deposit rates and international interest 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 When you're considering a loan, look carefully at the terms and make sure you 
understand them. Ask which index will be used and where it is published -- or 
whom you can call to find out the current index rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Then set up a file where you can keep the mortgage documents and periodic 
statements. And make a point of checking the terms of the loan each time it is 
adjusted. If you understand the loan and start from the beginning, monitoring 
your mortgage shouldn't take more than five or 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, check the index rate on the day your loan adjusts, and add the 
index figure to the "margin." If your loan allows for rounding to the nearest 
eighth of a percentage point, as most do, check to see if the number should be 
rounded up or down. Also look to see if the interest rate would be affected by 
a "cap" that limits interest rate movements. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, let's say you have an ARM that floats 2.5% above the 11th 
District Cost of Funds index and has a two-percentage-point annual interest 
rate cap. On the adjustment date, the 11th District index is at 6.43578. You 
add that to 2.5 to come up with 8.93578. Your loan is rounded to the nearest 
eighth -- any multiple of 0.125 -- which, in this case, would be 8.875%. But, 
because your previous rate was 6.5% and you have a two-percentage-point annual 
cap, your rate will be just 8.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 If you come up with something different than the bank did, call or write them 
and ask for an explanation. They are legally required to respond "in timely 
fashion," which generally means within a month or so. 
</P>
<P>
 If you find a mistake in your favor, don't expect to keep the difference. The 
bank is likely to catch up. And if you find a mistake against you, be aware 
that in California you get four years after the loan is paid off to find and 
protest errors. 
</P>
<P>
 Realize, too, that you're not looking for a gigantic error. The average error, 
which amounts to more than $1,500 over time, equates to just $22 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 If you've had an ARM for some time and feel incapable of monitoring it now, 
you might consider hiring a loan-monitoring company. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumer Loan Advocates also puts out a book that helps you do it on your own. 
The book, which comes with form letters and work sheets, costs $19.95 plus 
$4.95 shipping and handling. It can be ordered through Consumer Loan Advocates, 
655 Rockland Road, Lake Bluff, IL 60044. Phone: (708) 615-0024.

 Q: I have become a pack rat about saving credit card and ATM transaction 
receipts. Is there any reason to keep these slips if I find no discrepancies 
with my credit card and bank statements? Is there a time limit in which a 
credit card or bank statement can be disputed? -- V.C . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: If you do not find any discrepancies between your transaction receipts and 
your credit card and bank statements, there are few reasons to save these slips 
of paper. After all, can you think of any reason the amounts would change after 
their first and only posting to your account? Of course, you will want to save 
bank and credit card statements after you have verified them, but the 
individual transaction receipts can be discarded as soon as you are satisfied 
that they have served their purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers used to save credit card slips to document the sales tax deduction 
on income tax returns, but this deduction was long ago eliminated. You might 
want to save charge slips if you use your credit card to make charitable 
contributions or other deductible payments -- for medical expenses, child care 
or miscellaneous business charges. But unless they are needed to verify a 
deduction, you really have no reason to hold on to those receipts. Bankruptcy 
Rules on Pension Funds 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I am having severe financial difficulties and face foreclosure on my home 
and a potential bankruptcy filing. If we do end up in bankruptcy, can our 
creditors and the Internal Revenue Service go after my individual retirement 
account and other pension savings to satisfy our debts? -- M.R.Q . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Your IRA, Keogh or other pension accounts cannot be touched by creditors in 
a bankruptcy proceeding. If you emerge from bankruptcy without satisfying tax 
obligations (or making provisions to satisfy them in the future), the IRS could 
go after your retirement accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the IRS will actually seek to attach your pension assets to cover back 
taxes cannot be known with absolute precision. The agency is empowered to 
attach pension assets, but in practice it prefers to keep taxpayers from 
becoming impoverished in their old age. Experts say you would be wise to settle 
any debt to the government during the bankruptcy proceeding, either by paying 
all you owe or by making what is called an offer in compromise, in which you 
agree to pay a negotiated amount of the debt over time. Credit Card Bills as 
Debt of Estate 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My husband died leaving no estate from which to pay off a few thousand 
dollars in credit card bills. The cards were in his own name; I did not sign 
the applications. He was the only card user and paid on the accounts monthly 
from his own income. Am I liable for his outstanding debt? -- J.R . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Your obligation depends on whether the credit card issuer knew your husband 
was married and whether the creditor depended on your husband's community 
property assets to cover the debts accumulated on the card. This is generally 
known as the "intention of the creditor" test. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how it would be applied in your case: Did your husband indicate on his 
credit card application that he was married? Most cards have such a question. 
If he marked "yes," then the creditor can be said to have intended that the 
debts accumulated on the card would be the community property of the husband 
and wife, making you obligated for the debts he left at death. The only 
exception would occur if your husband, while noting that he was married, 
indicated that the debts on the card were not community property. Absent such a 
direct declaration, the debts are presumed to be community property. Principal 
Residence Replacement Costs 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My wife and I started construction of a home in March. We expect it to be 
completed by the end of the year. We began paying for the lot in 1991. When we 
sell our present home and move into this replacement residence, what portion of 
the costs will count toward purchase of a replacement residence? What 
constitutes completion of construction of the replacement residence? -- D.F . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A: Costs incurred within 24 months of the sale of the original residence -- 
that is, 24 months after and before -- count toward the cost of a replacement 
residence. For your entire construction costs to count, you must sell your 
present residence by March, 1996. Any costs paid within 24 months before the 
sale will count as well -- but anything paid before that point will not count.  
</P>
<P>
 Generally speaking, a certificate of occupancy should satisfy the IRS that the 
new home is your replacement residence. However, let's be clear that the IRS 
intends for you to be living in the home as well.

USE OF 'DARK FIBER' IS LIGHTING UP TELECOMMUNICATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Away from the bright lights of the telecommunications revolution, a host of 
small, fast-growing companies is saving customers a fortune through "dark 
fiber" -- that is, using spare capacity on international telecommunications 
networks. 
</P>
<P>
 The firms buy up capacity at wholesale rates and resell it in various ways to 
telecommunications users, undercutting international phone charges and grabbing 
customers. And their success is hastening the destruction of regulated 
international phone tariffs, although this will eventually destroy their own 
market, executives and analysts say. 
</P>
<P>
 The main players are USA Global Link, Executive TeleCard Ltd., Flash 
Telecommunications Inc. and International Discount Telecommunications (IDT). 
Customers can save 20 to 80% on overseas calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "These companies fill a niche provided by the high prices of the international 
call umbrella," said analyst Philip Sirlin of broker Wertheim Schroder. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiber is dark when it is unlit by the blitz of laser light that makes up 
modern telecommunications traffic. So much cable has been laid, in anticipation 
of expected demand into the 21st Century, that much is now surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some say as much as 80% of the fiber around the world is not lit up. We try 
to purchase that dark fiber," said William Gruzynski, president of Flash 
Telecommunications Inc. "As the cost is in laying the cable, not the fiber, you 
may as well put in 10,000 strands as 10." 
</P>
<P>
 Some firms are growing more than 10% a month. Only Executive TeleCard is 
publicly traded, although many are looking for investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Sprint, AT&T and a large European carrier have courted USA Global Link, which 
is in the process of arranging a $10-million equity offering. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives admit that the business won't survive the end of tariff regulation; 
when that happens, they plan to move into other spheres. 
</P>
<P>
 "As those markets are deregulated and liberalized, we can transfer our 
customer base to alternate means of call set-up transmission which are more 
cost effective and user friendly," said Christopher Hartnett, chief executive 
of USA Global Link, which has 100,000 customers in 112 countries. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, regulation over most of the world's telecommunications market is 
still in place and may take a decade to be dismantled. 
</P>
<P>
 Tariffs in some European and Asian countries for calls to the United States 
can be six or seven times as high as rates going in the other direction. So, 
many U.S.-based resellers find ingenious ways to let their overseas customers 
get U.S. rates or lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Flash, IDT and USA Global Link offer call-back services, where customers call 
a U.S. toll-free number, hang-up and get called back. The company then makes 
the customer's connection via the United States to wherever they like. It still 
works out cheaper than direct calling.

O.C. BANK'S DOWNFALL ALSO A HUMAN FAILURE; PSYCHOLOGY: SONORA GROUP LEASE FRAUD 
DEPENDED ON 234 GENERALLY LAW-ABIDING CITIZENS TO LIE ON LOAN DOCUMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a small scam, as frauds in affluent Orange County go. 
</P>
<P>
 A financing company called the Sonora Group ripped off a Newport Beach bank 
and several other lenders for nearly $12 million, leading to the bank's failure 
in August. 
</P>
<P>
 But what has regulators, federal authorities and lawyers shaking their heads 
is that the Sonora Group in Costa Mesa was able to get 234 generally 
law-abiding citizens -- including a tax accountant and nearly a dozen police 
officers -- to help it defraud the bank. 
</P>
<P>
 For up to $5,000 each, most of these average people agreed to lie on documents 
submitted to the Bank of Newport so that Sonora Group could get loan proceeds. 
And some were paid an additional $1,000 for each person they referred to the 
company to join the scam. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in a host of lawsuits in three counties, those people who allowed the 
Sonora Group to use their credit are being called to answer for their actions. 
A few have settled, but most assert that they themselves were victims of the 
Sonora Group's operators, Lucy F. Looney-Rau and her husband, Charles B. Rau. 
</P>
<P>
 Under loans arranged by the Sonora Group, a heavy equipment leasing company, 
the people had become lessees of equipment they never saw, and both Sonora and 
the lessees became responsible for repaying the loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a dozen regulators, prosecutors, investigators, bankers, sociologists 
and lawyers said they had not heard of a fraud that relied on the cooperation 
of so many people. Even Charles E. Duff, a civil and bankruptcy attorney for 
the Raus, is baffled. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you hear all the facts, it's astonishing," said Duff, who would not 
reveal much because a criminal investigation is pending against his clients and 
others. "The question you have is how could this happen. It's amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 Others are equally puzzled: 
</P>
<P>
 * "It was just astounding to me," said David L. Blankenhorn, who was brought 
in as the bank's president just as the scam was falling apart. "I wouldn't have 
believed it had we not unraveled it." 
</P>
<P>
 * Irvine lawyer Ronald Rus, called in by the bank in April to find out what 
happened, said the fraud struck the struggling bank "like a bolt out of the 
night," just as it had a buyer lined up. "We had a systematic bank robbery 
here," he said. "The lessees were not holding the guns, but they're the ones 
who were operating the getaway cars." 
</P>
<P>
 * "If these people had opened their eyes, they could have seen it was not 
possible, but they looked at the deals with their hearts or they closed their 
eyes, and they thought it was truly all right," said Paul Jesilow, associate 
professor of criminology at UC Irvine. "If you give people enough reasons for 
doing something illegal, you give them reason to say, 'I'm not to blame.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But David McKenzie, a lawyer for Bellflower tax accountant Nancy Givens, 
questions bank lending officers for accepting gifts from the Raus and for 
failing to verify essential elements of the loans. His client, he said, simply 
co-signed for loans that someone else was paying back. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a scam that took advantage of the greedy," McKenzie said, referring to 
the lessees. "Luckily, we haven't made greed a crime." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raus already have admitted to federal prosecutors that they defrauded the 
bank, according to court documents in the bank's lawsuit against them, but they 
have not entered a formal plea yet. The suit had been sealed from public view 
by an Orange County Superior Court judge until regulators last month moved the 
case to federal court in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say the Raus are cooperating in an ongoing and wide-ranging 
investigation, one that other sources said includes the actions of bank 
employees and the lessees. Lawyers familiar with the investigation expect it to 
be concluded in the next few months. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the scam led to the failure of a regulated financial institution, a 
sentence for anyone convicted of bank fraud could include up to four additional 
years in prison, according to a 1989 federal law. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raus went bankrupt in June and eventually took with them 13 companies they 
owned or controlled, including the Sonora Group. Among Sonora's debts are $5 
million owed to the Bank of Newport and more than $6 million to three other 
lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the knockout punch for the bank," Blankenhorn said. Regulators 
seized it Aug. 12 and closed it. HOW THE SCAM WORKED 
</P>
<P>
 Sonora was a financing and leasing company for truckers and others who needed 
heavy equipment but couldn't get a bank loan themselves. Lucy Looney -- by all 
accounts, a friendly, charming, persuasive woman -- had long been involved in 
the field and ran the company. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonora would buy, say, a forklift and lease it to a needy company. Then Sonora 
would sell the stream of payments owed under the lease to Bank of Newport, 
which collected monthly checks from the lessees. 
</P>
<P>
 Such lease-loan operations are common, legal and useful. The bank's loan is 
secured by title to the equipment, the lessee becomes the de facto borrower and 
the leasing company essentially guarantees that the monthly payments will be 
made. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy equipment users went to Sonora because it was a specialist in leasing 
such rolling stock, and they generally wanted to lease their equipment to 
obtain lower monthly payments than they would in repaying a loan to purchase 
the equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonora always used real people with real credit to get real loans, but since 
at least 1992, it began obtaining the loans for equipment that never existed, 
never was purchased or never was delivered, according to court documents. The 
lessees essentially were straw borrowers, though some might not have realized 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers investigating the scam said they don't know yet why the Raus began 
involving lessees in the phony scheme, and the Raus have remained mum so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Under their arrangements with Sonora, most lessees swore on documents or told 
bankers that they had the equipment in their possession and would be using it, 
the bank's lawsuit asserts. They mailed in monthly payments from their own 
checking accounts, but with money Sonora provided. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank and some lessees contend that Sonora used loan proceeds to pay off 
earlier loans, to give lessees up-front money for "lending their credit," as 
Looney called it, and to live the good life throwing lavish parties at places 
like the Ritz-Carlton Hotel in Pasadena and buying expensive gifts for lenders 
and lessees. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a classic Ponzi scheme," said Ken Drost, general counsel of New Era 
Funding Corp., which bought a number of the leases from Bank of Newport. Before 
buying the leases, New Era conducted its own research, Drost said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We called these people and asked if the equipment was there, and they said it 
was," he said. "We sent people to take pictures of the equipment, and found out 
later that Charles Rau would put the equipment there for a day -- just for the 
pictures." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyer Rus and other lawyers have found in pretrial discovery that some people 
set up dummy companies that acted simply to facilitate the loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly how many loans over the years had been fraudulent is uncertain. 
Investigator Evan Breitman of New York Credit in Marina del Rey, a company the 
bank retained in April to audit all Sonora files, said several hundred earlier 
lease-loans involved loans that had been fully repaid, with interest, on 
equipment that never existed. 
</P>
<P>
 The scam simply grew too large to cover all loans, he said, and most lessees 
now are looking for a way out. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some lessees said their names were forged, and a number of signatures may not 
match," Breitman said. "But they still made the monthly payments." 
</P>
<P>
 Sonora generated so many loans that it accounted for half the loans funded by 
the Bank of Newport's leasing division. The bank, close to exceeding its limit 
on the amount of money it could lend to one borrower, began selling some leases 
to New Era and to Bank of the West in San Francisco and a Textron Inc. 
subsidiary in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an anonymous letter to Textron Financial in early April that prompted 
the bank to look at its Sonora-arranged loans. Investigators believe an 
employee at Genuine Fisher, a Costa Mesa motorcycle parts company Charles Rau 
controlled, blew the whistle because he was angry that Rau was taking about 
$400,000 out of the fledgling Fisher to pay Sonora debts. "BORROWING" CREDIT 
</P>
<P>
 With 15 years in the business, Lucy Looney had helped a lot of truckers, 
trucking firms and other users of so-called rolling stock get the equipment 
they needed when their own credit wasn't good enough to obtain conventional 
bank loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the 1980s, first with a company called Perry Morris and, in 1986, 
with Sonora, Looney built a reputation as a friend to the heavy equipment 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "She furnished a real service to this little industry, where everyone started 
on a shoestring," Breitman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her own tax accountant, Nancy Givens, once co-signed on a loan Sonora arranged 
for Givens' boyfriend, who runs a heavy equipment company but whose own credit 
had been ruined in a previous venture. But the two truck trailers for which he 
obtained the loan were delivered and he paid off the loan, said Givens and her 
lawyer, McKenzie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime there was any equipment needed that no bank would handle, everybody 
in Fontana, where most of the heavy equipment is, said, 'Try Lucy at Sonora. 
She can always get it through,' " Givens said. 
</P>
<P>
 With such a reputation, Looney appeared to have an easy time calling in 
favors. 
</P>
<P>
 According to lessees in sworn pretrial and bankruptcy documents, Looney duped 
them with hard-luck stories -- a fellow trucker was ill or in financial trouble 
and his equipment would be seized unless he got a loan -- or with promises to 
push through pending loans if only they would help this friend of hers, this 
fellow trucker. 
</P>
<P>
 "One person got a horse because his daughter was an Olympic equestrian," said 
bank President Blankenhorn. 
</P>
<P>
 Givens herself thought she was simply co-signing on two loans Looney coaxed 
her into backing for a friend of Looney's -- whom Givens never met and now 
doubts ever existed. The loans, one for $54,050 and the other for $43,381, were 
supposed to be for forklifts that were being used by a "partner" in Ventura, 
Givens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the time, though, Looney simply offered $5,000 to "borrow" a friend's 
good credit for a loan on equipment for someone who couldn't get a loan on his 
own. She also offered $1,000 for any referral sent her way. 
</P>
<P>
 Givens, for instance, referred two of her other clients, Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Deputy Thomas Redd and Sgt. Stephen Q. Finley. In turn, Redd referred 
other police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Givens, Redd, Finley and scores of others are defendants in civil lawsuits 
brought by the bank and the other lenders to recover loan proceeds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone I know and talked to went into this in good faith assuming that 
everything was legitimate and the equipment existed," Redd said. "We all feel 
like victims." 
</P>
<P>
 Finley, an investigator, said that he thought he was getting into some kind of 
investment. "I'm not a businessman," he said. "I've been a police officer for 
24 years, but I'm not a white-collar crime expert. This whole thing baffles 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Milo Burdick, who runs a Santa Fe Springs trucking company, said he has known 
Looney for more than eight years and has purchased trucks and trailers through 
her previously. "I had no idea anything crazy was going on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But for lender New Era's general counsel, Ken Drost, "borrowing" someone's 
credit to deceive a bank about the true borrower's credit is essentially bank 
fraud. "I'm surprised so many people are involved," he said. "Some police 
officers, some accountants, some upstanding individuals who ought to know 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Raus' attorney Charles Duff, who also represents Charles Rau in 
connection with the criminal investigation, called such "credit borrowing" bank 
fraud. What he doesn't understand, he said, is how the scheme could go on for 
so long without the bank knowing about it. THE BANKERS 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Heipler, an Oxnard lawyer, represents about 60% of the lessees sued by 
the bank and other lenders. He promises to file a suit in January on behalf of 
his clients against Bank of Newport, Sonora and others. The bank especially, he 
asserts, was beyond negligent. Someone on the inside had to be in on the fraud 
-- or incredibly stupid, he contends. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Bank of Newport had about $12 million in lease-loans outstanding, and no 
one ever verified the existence of this equipment," Heipler said. "If they had 
done their duty, they wouldn't be out any money and all these people wouldn't 
have their financial future in jeopardy." 
</P>
<P>
 In depositions Heipler took of former bank employees, he drew out the fact 
that the Raus regularly gave gifts to Emil S. (Neal) Avellar, head of the 
bank's leasing division, and Carolyn Sidejas, his assistant who has worked with 
him in various jobs for the past 25 years and now lives with him as well in 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Avellar and Sidejas acknowledged in depositions that they exchanged Christmas 
gifts with the Raus and received birthday gifts from them. The gifts the 
bankers received included jewelry and clothes. The Raus also paid for the 
bankers' lodging for two nights at La Carrera Classic car race last year in 
Ensenada, Mexico. Federal law prohibits bankers from receiving gifts worth more 
than $25 from customers. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Avellar said in his deposition that he personally loaned $10,000 
to a Charles Rau company last year at a 40% interest rate and received only one 
interest payment for $375. Sidejas testified in hers that she did a bit better 
with her $10,000 investment in another Rau company, getting about $3,000 at a 
40% interest rate over eight months. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Avellar and Sidejas said in their depositions that they didn't think the 
Raus were trying to buy them off and that neither the gifts nor the investments 
affected their ability to evaluate, audit or review Sonora files. 
</P>
<P>
 Such gifts and investments so far have not caused the bank's insurance company 
to believe that there was any insider fraud. The insurer, which covers losses 
caused by employee embezzlement or fraud, is still reviewing the case, bank 
regulators said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, they were all friends. Asked if she felt betrayed by Lucy Looney, 
Sidejas said, "I feel spit on." 
</P>
<P>
 The bankers said they had trusted Looney and her husband. Though they didn't 
see every piece of equipment that was supposed to have been purchased and 
leased out, they said they called every lessee to ask if they had the 
equipment. They refused to approve the bank's purchase of any leases -- 
essentially fund any loans -- unless the lessees told them the equipment was in 
their possession and working properly. 
</P>
<P>
 When problems arose, such as missed monthly payments, the lessees continued to 
play along, telling bankers who called that they would get the payments in, 
Sidejas said in her deposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that they signed leases with Sonora knowing that they didn't have 
equipment and knowing that when we talked to them, they would be lying to us," 
she said in her deposition. "We have, of course, sat and said, 'Why, why, why 
would the Raus do this?' And I have to think, 'Why, why would the lessees do 
this?' " WHY THEY DO IT 
</P>
<P>
 Criminologists and sociologists said they aren't surprised that the average 
citizen lies or cheats. 
</P>
<P>
 "From my own perspective, I see it as normal," said Paul Jesilow, a UC Irvine 
associate professor of criminology. "Most of us do something illegal in a day 
and rationalize it, saying it wasn't illegal." 
</P>
<P>
 With a complex economy and a natural dislike of institutions, especially 
banks, people also can be won over easily by a con artist who provides a 
convincing hard-luck story to obtain the help needed to break the law, the 
professors said. 
</P>
<P>
 It also makes it easier to go along if people feel they can get away with it 
and if other people are involved in questionable activity, said Thomas Gabor, a 
criminology professor at the University of Ottawa. 
</P>
<P>
 "If others are involved and they know them, they feel in good company and 
their behavior becomes socially acceptable," said Gabor, whose book "Everybody 
Does It: Crime by the Public" was published in June. "Few people want to see 
themselves as different or deviant." 
</P>
<P>
 The major deterrent, Gabor said, is the certainty of facing charges, which 
research shows acts as a greater deterrent than the certainty of punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Helping someone in ill health or in financial trouble also provides people 
with a strong motive to bend the law, said Ron Fagan, a Pepperdine University 
sociology professor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of these people knew or should have known something fishy was going on," 
he said. Bank of Newport's Long Slide 
</P>
<P>
 Lease-loans to the Sonora Group were a final blow to struggling Bank of 
Newport. Long troubled with delinquent and non-paying loans, the bank saw its 
ratio of bad loans to total loans grow beyond the 3% level acceptable to 
regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad Loans* 1994**: $5.3 million 
</P>
<P>
 Bad loans as % of total loans 1994**: 4.57% Capital Crusher 
</P>
<P>
 The bank's increasing losses slowly eroded its capital -- its final cushion 
against losses. And its ratio of capital to assets dropped below the 6.5%

RESTAURANTS; BARGAIN ABUNDANCE; AT CA'BREA,ABBONDANZA ONLY OCCASIONALLY EQUALS 
BUON APPETITO 
</P>

 The plaster-dipped conceptual laundry that hung from Ca'Brea's high ceiling, 
each piece stenciled with a mysterious number, has finally come down. I always 
wondered about that. Did the entire staff come in one night and offer up their 
old clothes to make the cavernous, tall space seem a little less bare? Whatever 
the laundry's fate, Ca'Brea still feels urban and slyly hip, thanks to the big 
bold painting of espresso cups and saucers in the colors of the Italian flag 
and the comfy banquettes. It's also just as raucously, excruciatingly noisy as 
ever. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ca'Brea opened three years ago, this offshoot of Locanda Veneta seemed 
like an astonishing bargain: big plates of hearty Italian food at prices so low 
you could afford to come again and again. Prices have since gone up, but not 
all that much. Chicken was $12.50; it's $13.95 now, while osso buco, $10.50 
when the restaurant opened, has crept up to $13.95. Among the secondi , only 
the grilled veal chop and the fish of the day top $15. But Ca'Brea continues to 
serve up big portions. Outside, almost everyone waiting for a car holds a 
packet of leftover food. What it means is that you can almost order family 
style here. Not everybody at the table needs an antipasti and a main course. 
And forget about an intermediary pasta course: The abbondanza would stagger all 
but the hungriest. 
</P>
<P>
 Antipasti belies the name; any of them would just about make a meal on its 
own. I would be perfectly happy ordering a salad and the pork riblets with 
wonderful sage-scented brown and white beans or the juicy, browned 
chicken-and-pork sausages on a bed of braised cabbage. Or a Caesar and a bowl 
of chicken, corn and potato soup, both specials one night. Shrimp and crab 
cakes, however, turn out to be tough little rounds garnished with an 
unappealing, vinegary onion confit. And the clams? Rubbery. It's a wonder these 
two dishes are still on the menu. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasta has never been Ca'Brea's strong suit. Stuffed pastas are gummy, the 
sauces often incredibly oversalted. The popular bigoletti (Venetian spaghetti) 
is a big bowl of shrimp, clams and cut-up lobster in a tomato-and- porcini 
sauce that has far too much going on. The home-style linguine with clams, white 
wine and garlic is just right -- except for the clams, which are big and chewy 
instead of small and tender. 
</P>
<P>
 Not always, but often enough, I get the feeling that the cooks are dozing 
behind the stove; they've made the lamb chops with mustard and truffles, the 
osso buco and the chicken so many times, they're bored to death. When the 
kitchen is on, the schiacciata di pollo novello -- boned, flattened little 
birds marinated in white wine and herbs and then grilled to a golden crisp -- 
are terrific. Served with rough-cut, pan-roasted potatoes and a mound of fresh, 
sauteed spinach, this is an earthy and uncomplicated plate of food. At times, 
though, the chicken arrives at the table tired and overcooked, with soft, mealy 
potatoes and spinach that resembles the limp, khaki stuff Popeye tried to foist 
on us when we were kids. Sometimes the osso buco 's "hearty" sauce is oily and 
reduced to a thick paste of braised vegetables. Saltimbocca of veal, chicken 
and pork is so salty one night, it's inedible.  
</P>
<P>
 The wine list is more consistent. There are a few good California and Italian 
wines for less than $20, such as the always-reliable Santa Cristina Chianti 
from Antinori and the sturdy Salice Salentino from Apuglia. 
</P>
<P>
 Dessert? Opt for the lovely light tortino alla Veneziana, an individual 
cheesecake served naked in a puddle of blueberry puree. When we ordered the 
tiramisu and the crema di vaniglia , out came two bowls, one matte, one glossy. 
The cocoa-dusted tiramisu was old-tasting, sodden. We pushed it away. But our 
spoons kept dipping into the vanilla pudding covered with caramel sauce, a real 
kids' dessert. Next thing we knew, the table close by had ordered the same 
dessert. "We watched to see which one you kept eating, and that's what we 
ordered," one of the foursome giggled. 
</P>
<P>
 The place is fun, the service is congenial. If only the food were better. 
Antonio Tommasi, who started his first restaurant at Locanda Veneta, can cook, 
this I know. But he may be spreading himself too thin trying to supervise not 
only this and Locanda but also the two new restaurants he and his partners 
opened this year, Il Moro in West Los Angeles and Ca' del Sole in North 
Hollywood. At Ca'Brea, it feels as if nobody's home anymore. The informed 
passion for northern Italian cooking that once made this restaurant so 
appealing has gone missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ca'Brea, 346 S. La Brea Ave., Los Angeles; (213) 938-2863. Closed Saturdays at 
lunch and all day Sunday. Full bar, but no smoking anywhere. Valet parking.

 Ginnie Maes: An item on Government National Mortgage Assn. securities in the 
Nov. 13 Money Talk column inaccurately stated that interest payments on these 
securities are not guaranteed. Ginnie Maes, as they are called, carry the "full 
faith and credit " of the U.S. government, which guarantees repayment of 
principal as well as monthly payment of interest on the remaining outstanding 
principal. 
</P>
<P>
 What does this mean? Each monthly payment from Ginnie Mae includes interest as 
well as the return of some of the principal. (The exact amount of principal 
returned each month varies with the number of homeowners paying off their 
mortgages and cannot be predicted.) As principal is returned, the outstanding 
balance drops and so do the monthly interest payments. The actual interest rate 
paid by the security is unchanged over its life.

THE GOOD DOCTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The most telling line in your article about Dr. Scott Corder ("The Strange 
Faith of Dr. Corder," by Stephen Braun, Oct. 23) was when the Menninger Clinic 
doctor told him, "We want to help you get rid of your bizarre beliefs," meaning 
his belief in aliens. As a self-described "Catholic in remission," I find 
plausibility in, if not compelling evidence for, the existence of angels. 
</P>
<P>
 Would you want Corder as your doctor? Well that depends on what the choices 
are, doesn't it? This brings us back to the national debate we're not having on 
health care. It lends support in my mind to a single-payer health plan (to 
maximize choice), or at the very least to not talking philosophy with your 
physician. What do we pay bartenders for anyway?

POST POSTMODERN

<TEXT>
<P>
 The question of whether justice exists and reason can benefit society is all a 
matter of values, commitment and belief. Jurgen Habermas ("The Theologian of 
Talk," by Mitchell Stephens, Oct. 23) is not being idealistic when he argues 
that open, rational dialogue can lead to profound change in attitude and 
conduct. Look to education for the best example of this. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happened to Camus' point that man's only hope is to gain insight for 
a better life in spite of all the darkness around him? If we lose hope in the 
art of the possible, then the values we have fought for lose meaning.

 Your article on Habermas exposed postmodernism as a silly sham. The 
deconstructionists say that no one can ever explain what they mean by using 
words. And the philosophers of the movement look at the atrocities of the 
1930s-1940s and conclude that the use of reason is a delusion. 
</P>
<P>
 People do share a common desire and hope. We are social animals and desire the 
acceptance and approval of others in our group. That group at times might want 
some strange things, but that in no way negates the idea that we share common 
aspirations.

 As a professor who for years has taught a course on the conflict between 
modern and postmodern political theorists, it was delightful to see the piece 
on Habermas. I did have one major objection that I felt compelled to voice, and 
that concerns the title itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The term theologian implies, and the piece itself does little to dispel, the 
image of Habermas' work as ephemeral, groundless and abstract in the vulgar 
sense of those words. In fact, Habermas' theories are firmly based in the works 
of some of the key figures of modern social science, including Karl Marx, 
Sigmund Freud and Max Weber. 
</P>
<P>
 Habermas is a dedicated researcher in the human sciences. His theory of 
communication is not the outcome of his innate beliefs but is the result of his 
theoretical analysis.

 The article on philosopher Jurgen Habermas was a welcome and timely surprise. 
One point seems worth adding to Stephens' excellent account: There are 
historical links between the Nazi past and the postmodernist present against 
which Habermas has battled. The late Paul de Mann, a leading postmodernist, 
wrote pro-Nazi propaganda during World War II under another name, while Derrida 
himself studied under Heidegger, who publicly supported the Nazis during their 
"purification" of German academia. 
</P>
<P>
 The striking, flashy insights of postmodernist analysis can easily blind its 
practitioners to the simple question: Where does all this lead? Habermas forces 
the more thoughtful postmodernist practitioners to confront this question.

 Will someone please explain to me what exactly it is that philosophers do for 
a living? Exactly who are Habermas, Jacques Derrida and Michael Foucault trying 
to reach? These ivory tower bores need a reality check: Their publish-or-perish 
nonsense is as "important" as the latest clothing fads. 
</P>
<P>
 At least Habermas doesn't try to tell others what they really mean, unlike the 
deconstructionists, who are so busy trying to be intellectual emperors that 
they haven't noticed how naked they are.

 I want to express my appreciation for the transformation of the L.A. Times 
Magazine over the years. The magazine is consistently the best place to look 
for political, cultural, and social analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 What confirmed my belief in the quality of your work was the article on 
Habermas. I would never have expected an article on a person with so little 
popular appeal in this country.

FREEWAY JAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jonathan Gold's observations about the controversial Long Beach Freeway 
extension ("A Cut Below," Three on the Town, Oct. 9) were refreshingly 
sensitive. South Pasadena is one of the rare towns in rootless Southern 
California where people live in the houses their grandparents built. It should 
be cherished and studied, not sacrificed on the altar of the automobile. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the pro-freeway voices are simply advocating growth for growth's sake. 
The Antelope Valley and Riverside freeways induced people to take on long 
commutes, increasing congestion on old and new freeways alike. Greedy 
developers and power-hungry local politicians, anticipating completion of our 
freeway system, have already mapped out new tracts in Kern County. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, we South Pasadenans will chain ourselves to the bulldozers. We will not 
let Caltrans carve a concrete scar across the middle of our beloved, historic 
community -- just so somebody who works in Long Beach can live in Bakersfield.

 I was on Gold's side of urban renewal at the expense of distinctive culture -- 
until he mentioned the Century Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 I am one of the many people now benefiting from that freeway. Following the 
civil unrest of 1992, several of us entrepreneurs on the Westside became 
committed to improving the conditions of South-Central L.A. residents, and we 
have spent many hours traveling to Watts, Compton, Lynwood and other 
communities to implement a self-empowerment program. The creation of the 
Century Freeway reduced our travel time significantly. 
</P>
<P>
 When I read Gold's conclusion that the major attribute of the Century Freeway 
was to shave "only five or 10 minutes off a trip to the airport from Downtown," 
it became obvious that he is not aware of the hundreds of people who have 
shaved hours off their commute to assist a community at risk.

 Imagine, for a moment, exiting the northbound San Diego Freeway at Venice 
Boulevard, taking some less-than-direct surface streets, and then getting back 
on the freeway at Sunset Boulevard. Sound silly? That's the way Los Angeles 
might look if the opponents of the Long Beach freeway completion have their 
way. The loss of a number of old homes is certainly tragic, but the greater 
good for thousands of residents has to take precedence.

ON THE TOWN: THE JUNGLE OUT THERE; A FEARLESS INTERLOPER, BOUGAINVILLEA HAS A 
HOLD ON L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Wanda Coleman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Magenta rains briskly from above, clings to my hair. I'm caught in a light 
shower of bougainvillea. 
</P>
<P>
 For years now, I have observed this growth. Languid at first, now it extends, 
with an insatiable appetite for space. Almost surprising are the bursts of 
blush erupting from sturdy, thorny, yet elegant tendrils. In our neighborhood, 
on long walks, I've spotted several variations -- white, orange, red-orange, 
red, purple. Knowing nothing of its origin, I'd always thought of it as exotic, 
of another tropical place, listened to it as if it were music -- a fado guitar 
strummed in the back rooms of a smoky consciousness. Rhythm in the snap of 
leaflike bracts that are like hands clasping, clapping, cupping. I've heard 
rubber soles and boot heels hissing and rapping along finished mahogany. I've 
seen the ambitious legs of dancers expressing the hunger of torsos; weighty 
vines swaying like hips, a heaving, seductive, movement to the wind-song 
castings of a spell. 
</P>
<P>
 The jungle come to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 On certain mornings -- that metacognitive kind, when dust and sunshine join in 
a way that epitomizes a season -- I turn to see them scratching and peeking in 
against the window, divinely rose-colored eyes at the panes. Life seeing life 
and feeling more alive in that shared instance of seeing. 
</P>
<P>
 Or when drenched and bleeding afternoon sun. . . 
</P>
<P>
 Approaching home, we can see it, from half a block away, arching skyward, 
blanketing the aged roof. Pulling curbside to park, I can't resist looking once 
more to discover which virgin corner of our tiny lot has been violated. There 
now hangs a drape of magenta where a gardener-for-hire pruned back the small 
rosebushes that once annually banked the white wood fence in a blaze of bright 
yellow blooms. In spots, this renegade liana has become heavy and violently 
threatening, attempting to strangle all lesser bushes. It long ago overwhelmed 
our bird of paradise.  
</P>
<P>
 The slim, olive-skinned young Latino stands outside our house and looks up. We 
called and asked him to come by and give us an estimate on the job. His partner 
watches us from the truck. We're all looking up, necks craned. The 
bougainvillea is half as tall as the telephone poles. One hand on my hip, the 
other waving and pointing, I indicate how many feet I want trimmed from there, 
there and there. I want more sun coming in through the windows. My husband 
wants the assurance of privacy. When we finish telling him what we want, he 
stands back and takes another unenthusiastic look. Of course, he'll have to use 
a ladder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll call you with the estimate on Monday." Then he and his partner drive 
away. He never calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Plowing through reference books, I discover the name is French, the plant 
christened after the 18th-Century explorer, Louis de Bougainville, who found 
the species growing somewhere outside Rio de Janeiro.  
</P>
<P>
 Brazilian and beautifully deadly, it's the double-barbed hex of a curanadera . 
Beneath a verdant surface, the vines thicken into the dense brittle cording of 
self-strangulation. Dead yellowy-orange and magenta leaves litter our yard and 
the sidewalk outside. This may be a fire hazard, we think, every now and then 
attacking them with the rake, bagging them for discard. We have purchased a 
special knife, its serrated blade perfect for hacking the overgrowth obscuring 
doors and windows, weaving in and around the burglar bars. 
</P>
<P>
 Passers-by have to abandon the sidewalk to get around our little house, which 
promises to collapse one day soon, smashed not by an earthquake but under the 
weight of Bougainvillea spectabilis . 
</P>
<P>
 It has become a popular atmospheric component in the works of writers 
describing this region, a strong contender with the palm and the Joshua tree. 
Bougainvillea seems symbolic, metaphor for an unstoppable migration, an 
irreversible change introduced into our social topography.

where they lost to Fresno Bullard. Dony Wilcher, one of the top junior 
prospects in the state, returns at point guard where he averaged 12 points and 
eight assists. Forward Thomas Hildreth averaged eight points and seven 
rebounds. Cameron Carson, who averaged 20 points and 15 rebounds at the junior 
varsity level, is the team's version of Dennis Rodman, personality and 
rebounding wise. Look for Fremont to contend for the 4-A title again this

Corey Williams, 6-5 forward, is a transfer student from Ribet Academy. Although 
the Cougars are inexperienced, they may be one of the quickest and strongest

to their advantage. Junior center-forward Rigoberto Bejarano figures to be the 
go-to player in the paint. Senior guard George Gutierrez, who averaged 10.5 
points a game last season, had knee surgery last month and would be a big plus

ART NOTES: RUSSIA'S HERMITAGE OPENS TO THE WORLD; A HIGH-LEVEL INTERNATIONAL 
CAMPAIGN IS UNDER WAY TO ENLIST THE AID OF ART LOVERS IN RENOVATING THE STORIED 
MUSEUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The woes of St. Petersburg's venerable Hermitage Museum are not a Russian 
state secret. Ever since the mid-1980s when glasnost and perestroika opened the 
former Soviet Union's doors to Western reporters and loosened the lips of the 
museum's staff, press reports have sounded alarms about crumbling plaster, 
peeling paint, faulty plumbing and inadequate security -- all of which endanger 
one of the world's greatest art collections. 
</P>
<P>
 But now that a high-level international campaign to upgrade and expand the 
Hermitage is under way, you are likely to hear much more about the museum's 
problems and how you can help. 
</P>
<P>
 Send money? Well, yes. The Hermitage fund-raisers have a goal of raising $300 
million to $400 million to renovate the palatial structure and expand into 
several nearby buildings now occupied by military facilities. But the campaign 
also aims to raise awareness of the museum's status and to make the venerable 
institution a more prominent member of a worldwide museum community, according 
to Hermitage Director Mikhail Piotrovski. 
</P>
<P>
 Traveling across the United States with representatives of UNESCO and the 
American Friends of the State Hermitage Museum Inc., Piotrovski recently 
stopped in Southern California where he met with cultural leaders and visited 
the J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles County Museum of Art and Huntington 
Library, Art Galleries and Botanical Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are developing a new way of life at the museum, a more open way," 
Piotrovski said in an interview. Part of the process is cultivating "friends 
who have special connections to the Hermitage or special feelings about it," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian government provides the majority of support for the museum's 
annual operating budget, contributing $4 million of a $7-million budget last 
year and around $7 million of this year's $10-million budget. The government 
also will be the major contributor to the renovation and expansion project, but 
gifts must make up the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "In this new situation we have won our freedom, but we have to pay for the 
freedom," Piotrovski said. Donations also help pressure the government to do 
its part, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Asking foreigners to help save a national monument requires Russians to 
swallow their pride, Piotrovski said. Potential foreign donors, on the other 
hand, ask why they should support a Russian institution when many of their 
hometown museums are needy. With its vast international collection of art, the 
Hermitage symbolizes Russia's ability to embrace the world's culture, but the 
museum also belongs to the world and deserves widespread support, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 UNESCO is leading the fund-raising drive and helping to establish foreign 
Friends of the Hermitage chapters, each of which will adopt a special project. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Friends was launched last June and promptly gave the museum 
$50,000 for a security system. The group's current goal is to raise $12 million 
for a new museum entrance that will provide orientation information and other 
visitor services. "The new entrance will be much more comfortable and 
user-friendly," Piotrovski said. "It's quite symbolic of our new attitude."

 ALL'S FAIR: For the first time in nine years, ART/LA isn't happening because 
of the art market's continuing slump. But two other contemporary art fairs -- 
which promise to be more affordable for dealers and collectors alike -- are 
coming to Los Angeles, and both are being launched Friday through next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gramercy International Contemporary Art Fair -- a dealer-organized fair 
whose debut at New York's Gramercy Park Hotel last spring was a raging success 
-- will open in the Southland at Chateau Marmont in Hollywood. For the New York 
affair, adventurous young dealers installed artworks in hotel-room closets, 
bureaus, bars and beds, and low-end sales were reportedly brisk. At the 
upcoming Los Angeles event, about two dozen galleries will present works by 
emerging artists on five floors of a landmark hotel, at 8221 Sunset Blvd., from 
noon to 8 p.m. each day. Participants include Food House, Sue Spaid and TRI 
galleries from Los Angeles; Fawbush, Jay Gorney and Pat Hearn from New York, 
and Xavier Hufkens from Brussels. The art is for sale, but there's no admission 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Above all, I think it's going to be a lot of fun," says Santa Monica dealer 
Christopher Grimes, who plans to display artworks in the living room, bedroom, 
kitchen and bathroom of his suite. Although the setting has limitations, it 
allows potential buyers to see art in a homelike atmosphere instead of a 
clinical art-fair booth, he says. The Gramercy approach is the way to go in the 
'90s, according to Grimes, because it "takes the pressure off" in an intimate 
atmosphere that encourages dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 The other fair, Art Los Angeles 1994, will be staged at Los Angeles Convention 
Center. Organizer John Natsoulas, who owns a contemporary art gallery in Davis, 
previously announced plans for a December art fair at Universal Studios. 
Natsoulas says he switched to the Convention Center because he hadn't reserved 
enough space to accommodate the unexpectedly large number of dealers who 
responded. Among the 60 or so participating galleries are Nicholas Treadwell of 
London, Galerie Liaison Beaux Arts of Paris, Jain Marunouchi of New York and 
William Turner of Venice, Calif. Artists talks and demonstrations also are 
scheduled. A $35-ticket benefit for the Archives of American Art will kick off 
the fair on Thursday, 6-9 p.m. Public hours: Friday, 10 a.m.-10 p.m.; Saturday, 
noon-10 p.m.; next Sunday, 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Admission: $8 for a one-day pass, $12 
for a weekend pass (good for Saturday and Sunday). 
</P>
<P>
 Yet another event is planned at Santa Monica's Broadway Gallery Complex on 
Saturday, 6-10 p.m. Eleven galleries will present an "Art of Giving" exhibition 
and sale, with 10% of proceeds benefiting Inner-City Arts, a nonprofit 
organization dedicated to providing youths with positive experiences through 
the arts. Information: (310) 829-3300. 
</P>
<P>
 ROMPER ROOM: Molly Barnes, an art dealer, consultant and commentator who 
divides her time between Los Angeles and New York, has advice for all you 
artists who don't know what you're doing. In a new paperback book, "How to Get 
Hung: A Practical Guide for Emerging Artists," published by Journey Editions, 
she offers tips on such baffling problems as how to behave at art openings and 
how to cultivate critics -- and drops plenty of names in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 As to getting the word out, she counsels artists to give their exhibition 
press releases "a tough proof-reading." However, a press kit advertising her 
book says that Georgia O'Keefe (sic) was Barnes' role model. 
</P>
<P>
 Moving right along to a chapter called "Look Good Like an Artist Should," 
Barnes writes: "Good-looking people get attention in every field and the art 
world is no exception." If you don't happen to be "naturally appearance 
conscious," she offers this: "Get help." You could, for example, attend a 
student day at Vidal Sassoon or accept a make-over offer from a cosmetics firm. 
</P>
<P>
 When preparing for a dealer's visit to your studio, you should provide two 
chairs, preferably old-fashioned rockers. It's OK to wear jeans and a nice 
T-shirt, "if they are clean and pressed," she says, but women artists should 
dress to show off their figures. 
</P>
<P>
 CLAY TALK: "West Coast Ceramics," a panel of ceramic luminaries John Mason, 
Jim Melchert, Susan Peterson, Paul Soldner and Peter Voulkos, is scheduled for 
next Sunday, at 2 p.m., at Scripps College Humanities Auditorium in Claremont. 
A closing reception for the exhibition "Revolution in Clay: The Marer 
Collection of Contemporary Ceramics" will follow, from 3-5 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 After leaving Scripps, the 50-year survey of ceramic art will travel to eight 
museums across the country. The college has published a 176-page color 
catalogue of the Marer collection, with essays by Kay Koeninger, Mary Davis 
MacNaughton and Martha Drexler Lynn, in conjunction with the exhibition.

MARTYR, SCHOOLGIRL, SOLDIER, TERRORIST: THE BATTLE FOR EGYPT; SQUEEZED BETWEEN 
THE VIOLENCE OF ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISTS AND A CAMPAIGN OF TERROR BY THEIR 
GOVERNMENT, EGYPTIANS MUST CHOOSE SIDES IN A BATTLE FOR NATIONAL SURVIVAL THAT 
NEITHER SIDE TRULY DESERVES TO WIN

<TEXT>
<P>
 It is a morning like many mornings at the Hole of the Snake cafe, with the 
scent of cardamom-flavored coffee, the gurgling of water pipes and the stench 
of the butchers' trade in the air. Work-weary men, their white galabiyas 
dappled down the front with blood, sip and gossip and nod off surrounded by the 
bedlam of Cairo's second-largest slaughterhouse. The alarming knives of their 
trade, the size of fat swords, glint in holsters slung across the backs of 
their chairs. At a shop next door, a burly man with trunk-sized arms 
rhythmically whacks at the bones and entrails of what perhaps recently was a 
cow, with explosive results. Not an eyebrow lifts. 
</P>
<P>
 On this morning, Mustafa the Alexandrian, at the center table near the street, 
is the focus of attention. In the ancient Zeinhoum slaughterhouse quarter, 
whose ancient wall dates back centuries (it was already 300 years old when the 
Arab crusader warrior Saladine extended it), time is measured in eras, and 
Mustafa is still "the Alexandrian" even though he migrated to Cairo from 
Alexandria 28 years ago with his butcher father at the age of 4. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank God I am not afraid of this kind of thing," says Mustafa of the recent 
night when Islamic militants, apparently caught up in a midnight operation that 
went awry, opened fire at large with their automatic weapons -- prompting 
Mustafa to pick up his knives, run into the alley in his nightclothes and set 
to work on one of them, sending him to the hospital two slices away from a 
human cutlet. He was offered a medal by the Ministry of Interior, which he 
bashfully declined. 
</P>
<P>
 "After I attacked him, I even cried about him. He was a normal, healthy young 
guy. But I had to do it because I was seeing somebody killing people. How else 
would I beat him but cruelly? What I did was a national duty." 
</P>
<P>
 It is in these small dramas -- the butcher and the terrorist, the schoolgirl 
who died from the bomb intended for the prime minister, the automobile dealer 
who turned in the terrorist, only to be gunned down in his shop by vengeful 
militants when he became a national celebrity -- that the story of Egypt's war 
with Islamic militancy has unfolded during the past two years, with every 
chapter ending in death: more than 435 so far. 
</P>
<P>
 Islamic violence has been a part of the Middle East landscape for decades, 
most prominently since the 1979 Islamic revolution in Iran and the 16-year 
civil war in Lebanon that prompted American troops to pull out in 1984 in 
exasperation when confronted with Shiite Islamic wrath. But it is in Egypt, the 
cosmopolitan heart of Arab learning and culture, and America's key Arab ally, 
that the most crucial battle for the soul of Arabia is unfolding. With Islamic 
unrest also threatening stability in neighboring Palestine, Jordan, Algeria, 
Tunisia and even Libya, the outcome in Egypt, with its 60 million citizens, 
will likely shape the future of all of North Africa and the Middle East.  
</P>
<P>
 Cairo's teeming streets, with their neon Coca-Cola billboards, lascivious 
movie posters and ubiquitous Kleenex vendors, seem an unlikely breeding ground 
for Islamic revolution. Indeed, Egypt has long been one of the Arab world's 
most secular societies. Yet the past decade has seen a sea change in Egypt that 
reflects the growing influence of religion and tradition worldwide. An 
increasing number of Egyptian women don't venture outside without a modest head 
scarf and ankle-length dress. Mosques have sprung up on every other street 
corner, with private mosques now numbering approximately 70,000. Government 
television -- accused by embittered secularists of nurturing the Islamic tide 
-- features five-times-a-day alerts to the Muslim call to prayer. Cairo's 
poorer quarters are festooned with Muslim Brotherhood posters proclaiming 
"Islam is the Solution" that reappear as fast as the government can peel them 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor does the battle show any real signs of abating. After a lull of several 
months, when authorities rounded up and executed many key militant leaders, the 
renegade Gamaa al Islamiya, or Islamic Group, began striking again to disrupt 
the United Nations-sponsored International Conference on Population and 
Development in Cairo in September. Warning foreigners to stay away from the 
"licentious conference" and its focus on abortion, birth control and sex 
education, Islamic militants attacked foreigners as far away as Upper Egypt and 
the Red Sea resort of Hurghada, spraying gunfire at two busloads of Spanish and 
British tourists in August and October (killing two and wounding six others), 
fatally shooting a German tourist and two Egyptians in a crowded square in 
September, ambushing a U.N. vehicle in mid-September (killing one UNICEF 
employee and four police escorts and gravely wounding another UNICEF worker and 
a photographer) and launching a fresh wave of violence against Egyptian police 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The cold-blooded nature of the war became chillingly clear on Oct. 14, when 
one of Egypt's most famous citizens, Nobel Prize-winning novelist Naguib 
Mahfouz, was stabbed in the neck by a suspected militant as Mahfouz tottered 
out of his house in Cairo en route to an evening rendezvous with other writers. 
The 83-year-old writer, who is diabetic, hard of hearing and nearly blind, had 
thought the attacker was a well-wisher who wanted to shake his hand. (Mahfouz 
remains hospitalized in stable condition.)  
</P>
<P>
 Directed by exiles in Pakistan and Afghanistan, in European capitals where 
Egyptian Islamic leaders have been granted asylum, in New York -- where the 
notorious Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman, spiritual leader of the Gamaa al Islamiya, 
collected funds to dispatch back to militants in Egypt -- and even in Cairo's 
hellish prisons, the militants' campaign has focused on police officers and 
tourists. This year, the campaign included a series of bombings at banks, 
designed to target foreign investment and discourage the awarding of banking 
interest, which fundamentalists view as illegal under the Koran. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has responded with a terror campaign of its own, dispatching 
thousands of forces into villages in Upper Egypt, a region that begins about 75 
miles south of Cairo and extends through the southern and central portion of 
the country, deploying armored personnel carriers and missile launchers in 
crowded slums and launching heavy-firepower operations against militant 
hide-outs. Reports of torture in Egyptian prisons -- one of them so notorious 
it is dubbed "Scorpion Prison" -- are practically commonplace: electric shocks 
applied to the genitals; lemons squeezed in the eyes; filthy water injected 
into muscle tissue. Whole towns in Upper Egypt have been subjected to repeated 
curfews, crushing their dubious economies, and it is not unusual for entire 
families to be arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 I was not ready to believe these stories, despite repeated complaints from 
human-rights organizations, until I visited a family near the oasis town of 
Fayoum, Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman's hometown west of Cairo, a family whose 
19-year-old son, Moursi Ramadan Mohammed Moursi, had just been hanged by the 
government for murderous militant activities. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not unlikely that Moursi had participated in the shooting of a police 
intelligence officer loathed by fundamentalists in Fayoum, as the government 
said he did. Perhaps he even deserved a death sentence. But sitting on the dirt 
floor of the living room of their tiny home -- joined occasionally by a pair of 
curious chickens and peering neighbors -- Moursi's family said they wondered 
what they had done to earn their place in the drama. 
</P>
<P>
 The day of the shooting, an army of police officers descended on the family 
home and started asking questions. Moursi's 11-year-old brother was taken to 
the police station, hanged by his feet and beaten. His mother was blindfolded 
and beaten. His sister, four months pregnant, was beaten and shoved against the 
wall, and police officers, holding her naked, threatened to rape her in front 
of her husband unless he gave them information on Moursi's activities. Fire was 
set to several houses in the village, and Moursi's brother was thrown into the 
fire, then pulled out again by a neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tied my husband to an electric pole outside and they took me to the 
station," says Moursi's sister, who miscarried after the incident. "They 
undressed me in front of my brother and my husband and said they would rape me 
if he didn't confess." She begins to cry quietly. "So of course he confessed." 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, most Egyptians are unmoved by such stories. In fact, they will 
say the family probably deserved it, for harboring a dangerous militant. It is 
fundamentalist lawyers and human-rights organizations who register the most 
complaints about torture in Egypt, not the public, which has generally given 
the government carte blanche to do what's necessary to stop the terrorism that 
threatens to drag a tolerant and cosmopolitan country back into the nether 
world of religious fundamentalism.  
</P>
<P>
 Also surprising is how few Egyptians back the government's efforts, either. 
President Hosni Mubarak's regime is increasingly viewed as corrupt and 
dangerously out-of-touch, and much of the public supports the government only 
in its efforts to stop extremists. The fanfare that accompanied Mubarak's 
election to a third six-year term last fall -- complete with hot-air balloons, 
leaflets dropped from planes and banner headlines exulting over his 99% victory 
-- fell hollow in most Egyptian living rooms. Here, as in most Third World 
military regimes, the president had won because there was no opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The confrontation over the spread of militant Islam has forced nearly all 
Egyptians to choose sides. But it is only too clear to most citizens, caught in 
the middle of what they see as a struggle for the nation's survival, that 
neither side truly deserves to win. 
</P>
<P>
 To drive along the Nile in Asyut, the most dangerous place in Egypt, is to be 
almost hypnotized by the sultry landscape -- a carpet of green fields, bending 
date palms and slow-footed water buffalos that shimmers along riverbanks heavy 
with egrets. This has always been a land of outlaws, from the original tomb 
robbers who made their living from the riches of the buried pharaohs to 
modern-day villains who tend and transport valuable caches of opium and 
hashish. Whole villages in Qena, just south of Asyut in Upper Egypt, are given 
over to men casually slinging automatic rifles, and some villages the police 
simply never enter.  
</P>
<P>
 There are professional killers to be hired here, a species spawned by the 
family vendettas that rage for decades at a time. So it surprises no one that 
many of fundamentalism's elements have come together in these verdant farmlands 
to make radical Islam the nation's single most important political 
undercurrent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Islamic wave first generated by the creation of the Muslim Brotherhood in 
1928 got its strongest push in the 1970s from former Egyptian President Anwar 
Sadat, who supported Islamic militants to counter what he perceived to be a 
more serious threat from leftists and communists. The plan backfired when 
Sadat, cracking down on the enemy he had nurtured, was gunned down in 1981 by 
an Islamic Army lieutenant, Khalid Islambuli, who had seen his brother 
mistreated in an Asyut prison two months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 To understand the fundamentalists' current appeal, one must look at Egyptian 
politics from the 1920s through the '40s, when many of the minefields of the 
modern Middle East were laid. A continuing British occupation left the local 
monarch looking helpless and ridiculous; Arabs were defeated in Palestine and 
the state of Israel created; corruption and unemployment grew. The country 
endured a 1952 revolution that was supposed to throw out the evils of Western 
imperialism, an Egyptian king who answered to London and an out-of-touch 
wealthy elite. But in recent years, the revolution has been largely discredited 
and a disturbing echo of those times has begun to reverberate in the minds of 
many unhappy Egyptians: Nearly 50 years later, Palestine still belongs to 
Israel; the middle class boosted by the revolution is again disappearing in the 
widening gulf between rich and poor; corruption is at an all-time high, with 
stories daily in the local press about wealthy businessmen with government 
connections profiteering on the poor, and perpetual scandals involving 
government officials. Mubarak's regime is viewed by many, both supporters and 
opponents, as yet another tool of Western diplomacy. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, the center of Islamic radicalism in Egypt has been in Asyut, the 
country's third-largest city, in the achingly poor farm villages near it and in 
the nation's urban slums, disconnected swaths of misery that look like "Blade 
Runner" landscapes just across the Nile from the neatly trimmed polo fields of 
the elite Gezira Club in central Cairo. 
</P>
<P>
 Fundamentalists these past years have provided a glimpse of what an Islamic 
republic would look like in many parts of Egypt. Consider Imbaba, for example, 
a teeming district in the heart of Cairo crowded with immigrants from Upper 
Egypt. Until the government moved in 14,000 troops in a virtual invasion two 
years ago to stem the fundamentalists' influence, the Gamaa al Islamiya had 
declared a "state within a state" in Imbaba, appointing local "emirs" as 
governors and imposing Islamic law by fiat on millions of Cairenes. 
</P>
<P>
 More efficient than the Egyptian government in some ways, Gamaa-controlled 
mosques set up discount clinics and schools, offered meat to the poor at 
wholesale prices and established furniture factories to employ the jobless. 
Dissent was little tolerated. Girls and women were sharply criticized or 
harassed if they ventured outside without covering their heads, and Gamaa 
leaders extorted "taxes" from Christian shopkeepers to pay for their 
protection. In full view of uneasy police officers, Gamaa leaders convened 
public meetings in the street each Tuesday night, openly calling for the 
dispatching "to hell" of the "criminals" who had strayed from the right path of 
God. 
</P>
<P>
 Gamaa's war with the government started in 1990 with the killing, presumably 
by police, of the Gamaa's main spokesman in Cairo. The Gamaa and its companion 
group, the Jihad Organization, began picking off police and government 
officials, and then violence erupted wholesale with the massacre of 13 
Christians in the village of Manshiet Nasser near Asyut in 1992. The following 
Friday, the Gamaa "emir" in the adjacent village of Sanabu was killed by police 
as he emerged from his mosque after prayers. Soon the violence spread to 
attacks on foreign tourists, literary figures such as secularist writer Farag 
Foda, government officials such as Parliament Speaker Rifaat Mahgoub (killed 
when his motorcade was attacked in 1990), Interior Minister Hassan Alfi and 
Information Minister Safwat Sharif (both escaped assassination attempts) and 
the wave of bank bombings in Cairo and Upper Egypt this year. Police responded 
with a massive, weeklong siege on Imbaba and similar raids in the Upper 
Egyptian towns of Qosiya and Dairut, where previously police had feared even to 
enter.  
</P>
<P>
 The Muslim Brotherhood estimates that approximately 50,000 Islamic defendants 
are imprisoned. (Human-rights groups have variously estimated the numbers at 
20,000 to 30,000.) Most of the Gamaa's key leaders in Egypt are dead, victims 
of alleged shootouts with police, or executed after brief military trials 
summoned by Mubarak under Egypt's 13-year-old state of emergency. But only 
recently has the crackdown really begun to make inroads. In a series of 
intelligence coups, the Ministry of Interior this year aimed with surprising 
accuracy at the heart of the Gamaa leadership, uncovering high-level 
organizational meetings in progress and killing their participants.  
</P>
<P>
 Seven militants were killed in a Feb. 1 raid on an apartment in the northeast 
Cairo suburb of Zawya al-Hamra after an informant, later identified by the 
Gamaa as an undercover police officer, tipped off officials. Authorities 
followed up with another major bust and declared victory at an international 
press conference, only to see the Gamaa strike back in mid-April with the 
assassination of a leader in the war on terrorism, Maj. Gen. Raouf Khayrat. The 
deputy head of state security intelligence was incinerated when one of five 
assailants threw a bomb into his car as he was leaving his house near the 
pyramids. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our trap resulted in his death and the burning of his corpse in less than a 
minute," the Gamaa crowed in a fax to news agencies. "The operation asserts 
that mujahideen (holy warriors) will not delay a second to follow up tyrants, 
even if they feel they are safe. Raouf Khayrat ... died and burned the way they 
fight the youth: unjustly. But we are not alike. Our martyrs are in heaven, and 
their dead are in hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Women, as the symbols of Islamic purity and protection, have been on the front 
lines of the struggle over the nature of Arab society. Officially, they have 
been winning in Egypt. Literacy rates, though still substantially lower than 
those of men, have been climbing steadily and women's employment is at an 
all-time high. Women vote in Egypt and hold positions in the Cabinet and 
Parliament. Yet there has been increasing debates over their roles as 
professionals and homemakers, which have taken a feverish tone because Egypt 
seems to be identifying its society by the behavior of its women. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to battles in the schools over girls' wearing the Islamic veil, 
many women say they are being urged by their husbands to avoid improper mixing 
in the workplace. Doctor and writer Nawal Sadawi, a prominent advocate of 
women's rights, had her women's organization shut down by the government and 
its assets handed over to an Islamic women's group. A Cairo University 
professor was shocked this year to see a divorce petition filed on her behalf 
by a group of Islamists seeking to protect her from the secularist views of her 
husband, a professor at the same university. For large numbers of women, the 
question is perplexing: Where do they fit in Egypt's ever-shifting society? 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 500 teen-age girls north of Cairo suffered fainting spells. They 
were never explained, but an editor of a widely read women's magazine says the 
girls fainted because, in a world of increasingly conflicting signals, they 
didn't know what else to do. "Should they continue their studies and plan on 
working, or expect to get married and keep house? Should they wear the veil? Or 
skirts and blouses? They fainted because they simply don't know what to do," 
Ekbal Baraka says. 
</P>
<P>
 Nagwa, a communications graduate of the American University of Cairo who 
doesn't want her last name used, faced such choices. She had reached the 
dubious age of her mid-30s last year before finally consenting to become 
engaged, to her family's great relief. Nagwa, who usually wears red lipstick 
and stylish slacks, had said she didn't want to submit to the kind of man who 
would not allow her to work or maintain her own independence. But after meeting 
Ahmed, a young engineer and religious conservative, she admitted she might one 
day consider wearing the higab after her marriage. As the months went on, she 
found herself becoming more and more drawn to religion. When they are married, 
the couple announced, they plan to install a small mosque on the ground floor 
of their home. Cooing affectionately to her fiance over the telephone one 
afternoon, Nagwa prepares to end the conversation and go back to work.

 "There is no God but Allah," Ahmed says.  
</P>

 "And Mohammed," she replies, "is his prophet."

 The town of Dairut, just north of Asyut, is still reeling from more than a 
year of on-again, off-again curfews and police crackdowns. It is digging out of 
the crisis but remains a sullen little city. Merchants complain that they are 
being forced to pay taxes for a year in which most of the time they could not 
even leave their homes. "I did not make any profit. I was spending out of my 
assets, which are almost none," one grocer complains. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a recent survey, 12,323 of Dairut's 61,000 families live in 
shared housing, and 479 families live in shacks. The government, recognizing 
the shortfalls of the past, has recently allocated 10 million Egyptian pounds 
($2.9 million) on projects for drinking water, sanitary services and new 
electrical hookups. But the survey found 182,000 young men in Dairut -- a 
virtual powder keg -- unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 An aging sheik sits in his small reception room and says the government has 
not made good on its promises to build a new life for Upper Egyptians. For 
years there have been promises, and no results, he says. "The government and 
the interior ministry say we are the ruling party that has the power and the 
authority in this country. And the youth say we are the youth that have the 
energy, the belief and the ideals. Each one of them started pushing his horse 
forward. And Egypt does not find the person that says, 'Stop there,' " the old 
man says. "All of Egypt now is waiting for an explosion, a national blow-up." 
</P>
<P>
 This appears to be a gentle old man. He is from one of Dairut's oldest 
aristocratic families and is a former member of the provincial government. As 
he sits somewhat nervously in this Islamic hotbed, I ask him if the claims of 
violence are being exaggerated. Are foreign tourists safe here? 
</P>
<P>
 "No," he says, his wide eyes unblinking. "I do not think tourists are safe. 
Because there is no scale or indicator to the situation now. The government 
says it wiped out the Gamaa, and the next morning the Gamaa carries out an 
operation. And it turns out the government doesn't know anything about the 
Gamaa." 
</P>
<P>
 The problems of Dairut are magnified in the slums on the outskirts of Cairo, 
where Upper Egyptians have migrated over the years only to find a new urban 
life of poverty and limitation. In the Zawya al-Hamra district, site of one of 
the most violent confrontations between police forces and the fundamentalists 
in February, stacks of concrete houses stand in a bleak landscape of dust, 
garbage and running sewage. On a recent steaming afternoon, a crowd of men is 
clustered around a public water tap, sweating with wrenches over a broken water 
faucet that is the single source of water for an estimated 50,000 people.  
</P>
<P>
 "This whole neighborhood drinks out of this faucet -- maybe 40 years we've 
been living like this," complains Sayed Sharqawy, a retired refrigerator 
technician. "We put this in with our own money and we're fixing it with our own 
money. People s--- in cans and have to come and dump it in the street. Nobody 
else does anything for us because this is a poor neighborhood. They have no 
high-ranking officers of the government here." 
</P>
<P>
 "No water, no sewage, no electricity, no vegetation," adds Ali Abu Dahab, a 
40-year-old day laborer who lives in two rooms with his wife and five children. 
"People are living in a primitive world of instinct." 
</P>
<P>
 In the headquarters of the Muslim Brotherhood, a small, unmarked office above 
a fetid vegetable market in downtown Cairo, spokesman Maamoun Hodaiby sits in a 
gray leisure suit below a poster depicting a large octopus, labeled with a U.S. 
flag, spreading its tentacles around the globe. Another picture shows 
Jerusalem's Dome of the Rock, one of Islam's holiest sites, locked with a chain 
bearing the insignia of the Star of David. It poses the question: "Omar 
conquered it, Saladin freed it, who has it now?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Muslim Brotherhood professes no relationship with the militant Gamaa al 
Islamiya, or Jihad Organization, and claims to be the nonviolent Islamic 
alternative in Egypt. Nonetheless it is illegal, and its members have joined 
the Egyptian Parliament only by running on the lists of the Socialist Labor 
Party. And its statements deploring the violence have only begun appearing 
lately in earnest, because of the sheer quantity of blood washing the Egyptian 
streets. Before that, the Brotherhood tended to say things like it "regretted" 
the violence "on both sides" and pointed out it wouldn't have happened had 
there been a democratic alternative. 
</P>
<P>
 "Behind this violence there are economic, financial, intellectual and social 
factors involved. But the most important thing is the lack of hope, hope for a 
peaceful solution to the problem. People ask themselves: How will the change 
come? And they become convinced that there is no chance for change except by 
using force," Hodaiby says. "Nevertheless, we are patient. (Spanish dictator 
Francisco) Franco ended. The communists ended. Everything has an end. You see, 
this government is very powerful in killing, and it has no other power. No one 
supports this regime. They have been in power more than 30 years, and they have 
got no plan. This man Mubarak has got nothing to say to his people. Nothing."  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Mubarak is widely perceived among political analysts to be attacking 
the symptoms of terrorism while moving only haltingly toward the free market 
and political reforms that could underscore a wider public confidence in 
Egypt's future. Privatization of inefficient state-run companies has moved at a 
snail's pace, partly due to fears of increasing unemployment, partly due to the 
bureaucrats who run them, who have been the basis of the regime's support for 
decades. To his credit, Mubarak has managed to cut inflation, stabilize the 
rate of exchange and reduce the level of foreign debt, laying the groundwork 
for more economic prosperity. But it has not been enough to inspire widespread 
confidence, let alone a feeling among poor Egyptians that they will benefit 
from any bonanza to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Tahseen Bashir, a longtime Egyptian diplomat, cautions that the government's 
harsh crackdown on Islamic militants could backfire. "This is creating an 
equalization in the minds of some of these groups and the police of one 
violence against another. The concept of a national state that keeps some norms 
of behavior is being squeezed out of existence. And that is very dangerous." 
</P>
<P>
 Mubarak has tended to blame Islamic violence on outside support from Iran and 
Sudan. Privately, senior government officials say Egypt is too turbulent and 
too underdeveloped to plunge headlong into democracy. They are fond of pointing 
to the experience in neighboring Algeria, where an Islamic party was legalized, 
gained the majority in national elections, forced the army to take over the 
country in a coup and plunged the nation into civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 "A reasonable degree of democracy is possible. A democratic trend which could 
be consolidated, which could be improved. And I believe this is what is 
happening in Egypt," says one government official, who asked not to be 
identified. "But it seems that during this process some forces are unleashed, 
and this intermediate stage is very critical. You allow people to criticize, 
and allow them to group into political parties, but the whole situation has not 
yet ripened for full-fledged democracy and an exchange of authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't forget these extremists received a great deal of support from the 
government under Sadat," adds the official. "And now we are the ones who are 
sorry for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost no one thinks the situation has yet progressed to a point where the 
stability of the regime is seriously threatened. "They do not have the ability 
to either overthrow the Egyptian government or to cause any kind of acute 
crisis in Egyptian society, based on what we've seen so far," says one Western 
diplomat who has studied the Islamic violence. "But the police in areas like 
Asyut have become, in the eyes of a lot of people, another warring clan, and 
you've had a lot of people emerge from detention with a deep sense of personal 
grievance. Their families have a sense of personal grievance. And now the cycle 
looks very difficult to escape." 
</P>
<P>
 Cairo attorney Montasser Zayat concurs. "The picture is getting darker," says 
Zayat, who has gained notoriety in Egypt, first by defending Al-Sayed Nosair in 
the United States (Nosair was convicted on charges stemming from the death of 
militant Rabbi Meir Kahane), and later by taking on the most high-profile 
fundamentalist cases in Egypt, including the defense of Omar Abdul Rahman.  
</P>
<P>
 Zayat does not openly profess membership in the Gamaa al Islamiya, but at his 
ramshackle downtown office in Cairo, where clients' wives sit draped in 
anonymous black in the waiting room, he often acts as their unofficial 
spokesman. He is in prison now, held after protesting the arrest of a colleague 
who died in confinement. (Authorities say the man, Abdel Harith Madani, died of 
asthma. His fellow attorneys say he was tortured to death.) 
</P>
<P>
 "It is difficult to say the government can destroy the Islamic organizations," 
he said a few months before his arrest, "because by the nature of the Islamic 
religion, its followers become harder and have more solidarity after each 
crisis. We're waiting for the frustration explosion. Natural laws say that for 
every action, there is a reaction. Suppression will always be followed by an 
explosion, and previous history shows us that oppressors never last more than 
15 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting behind his desk, he took a sip of sweet tea. "Every household in Cairo 
has an element of the Islamic organization in it, and the Egyptian army in the 
end will find itself between two solutions. Either to be unbiased, or to comply 
with the national desire by changing the regime. There is no third 
alternative."

 I loved the restaurant's name, a compact curve of a word. Its sign, five big 
letters rimmed in neon, hovered above the roof. I almost never saw the sign 
with its neon lit; my parents took me there for early summer dinners, and even 
by the time we left -- father cleaning his teeth with a toothpick, mother 
carrying steak bones in a doggie-bag -- the sky was still bright. Heat rippled 
off the cars parked along Hollywood Boulevard, the asphalt gummy from hours of 
sun. 
</P>
<P>
 With its sleek architecture, chrome appliances, and arctic temperature, Burl's 
offered a refuge from the street. We usually sat at one of the booths in front 
of the plate-glass windows. During our dinner, people came to a halt before the 
news-vending machine on the corner and burrowed in their pockets and purses for 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 The waitresses at Burl's wore brown uniforms edged in checked gingham. From 
their breast pockets frothed white lace handkerchiefs. In between 
reconnaissance missions to the table, they busied themselves behind the counter 
and shouted "Tuna to travel" or "Scorch that patty" to a harried short-order 
cook who manned the grill. Miniature pitchers of cream and individual pats of 
butter were extracted from an industrial refrigerator. Coca-Cola shot from a 
glinting spigot. Waitresses dodged and bumped one another, frantic as atoms. 
</P>
<P>
 My parents usually lingered after the meal, nursing cups of coffee while I 
played with the beads of condensation on my glass of ice water, tasted Tabasco 
sauce, or twisted pieces of my paper napkin into mangled animals. One evening, 
annoyed with my restlessness, my father gave me a dime and asked me to buy him 
a Herald Examiner from the vending machine in front of the restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 Shouldering open the heavy glass door, I was seared by a sudden gust of heat. 
Traffic roared past me and stirred the air. Walking toward the newspaper 
machine, I held the dime so tightly it seemed to melt in my palm. Duty made me 
feel large and important. I inserted the dime and opened the box, yanking a 
Herald from the spring contraption that held it as tight as a mousetrap. When I 
turned around, paper in hand, I saw two women walking toward me. 
</P>
<P>
 Their high heels clicked on the sun-baked pavement. They were tall, 
broad-shouldered women who moved with a mixture of haste and defiance. They'd 
teased their hair into nearly identical black beehives. Dangling earrings 
flashed in the sun, brilliant as prisms. Each of them wore the kind of 
clinging, strapless outfit my mother referred to as a cocktail dress. The silky 
fabric -- one dress was purple, the other pink -- accentuated their breasts and 
hips and rippled with insolent highlights. The dresses exposed their bare arms, 
the slope of their shoulders and the smooth, powdered plane of flesh where 
their cleavage began. 
</P>
<P>
 I owned at the time a book called "Things for Boys and Girls to Do." There 
were pages to color, intricate mazes and connect-the-dots. But another type of 
puzzle came to mind as I watched those women walking toward me: What's Wrong 
With This Picture? Say the drawing of a dining room looked normal at first 
glance;, on closer inspection, a chair was missing its leg and the man who sat 
atop it wore half a pair of glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 The women had Adam's apples. 
</P>
<P>
 The closer they came, the shallower my breathing. I blocked the sidewalk, an 
incredulous child stalled in their path. When they saw me staring, they shifted 
their purses and linked their arms. There was something sisterly and 
conspiratorial about their sudden closeness. Though their mouths didn't move, I 
thought they might have been communicating without moving their lips, so 
telepathic did they seem as they joined arms and pressed together, 
synchronizing their heavy steps. The pages of the Herald fluttered in the wind. 
I felt them against my arm, light as batted lashes. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman in pink shot me a haughty glance and yet she seemed pleased that I'd 
taken notice, hungry to be admired by a man, or even an awestruck 8-year-old 
boy. She tried to stifle a grin, her red lipstick more voluptuous than the lips 
it painted. Rouge deepened her cheekbones. Eye shadow dusted her lids, a clumsy 
abundance of blue. Her face was like a page in "Things for Boys and Girls to 
Do," colored by a kid who went outside the lines. 
</P>
<P>
 At close range, I saw that her wig was slightly askew. I was certain it was a 
wig because my mother owned several; three Styrofoam heads lined a shelf in my 
mother's closet; upon them were perched a Page-Boy, an Empress and a Baby-Doll, 
all in shades of auburn. The woman in the pink dress wore her wig like a crown 
of glory. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was the woman in the purple dress who passed nearest me, and I saw that 
her jaw was heavily powdered, a half-successful attempt to disguise the 
telltale shadow of a beard. Just as I noticed this, her heel caught on a crack 
in the pavement and she reeled on her stilettos. It was then that I witnessed a 
rift in her composure, a window through which I could glimpse the shades of 
maleness that her dress and wig and makeup obscured. She shifted her shoulders 
and threw out her hands like a surfer riding a curl. The instant she regained 
her balance, she smoothed her dress, patted her hair and sauntered onward. 
</P>
<P>
 Any woman might be a man. The fact of it clanged through the chambers of my 
brain. In broad day, in the midst of traffic, with my parents drinking coffee a 
few feet away, I felt as if everything I understood, everything I had taken for 
granted up to that moment -- the curve of the earth, the heat of the sun, the 
reliability of my own eyes -- had been squeezed out of me. Who were those men? 
Did they help each other get inside those dresses? How many other people and 
things were not what they seemed? From the back, the impostors looked like 
women once again, slinky and curvaceous, purple and pink. I watched them 
disappear into the distance, their disguises so convincing that other people on 
the street seemed to take no notice, and for a moment wondered if I had 
imagined the whole encounter, a visitation by two unlikely muses. 
</P>
<P>
 Frozen in the middle of the sidewalk, I caught my reflection in the window of 
Burl's, a silhouette floating between his parents. They faced one another 
across a table. Once the solid embodiments of woman and man, pedestrians and 
traffic appeared to pass through them. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 There were some mornings, seconds before my eyes opened and my senses gathered 
into consciousness, that the child I was seemed to hover above the bed, and I 
couldn't tell what form my waking would take -- the body of a boy or the body 
of a girl. Finally stirring, I'd blink against the early light and greet each 
incarnation as a male with mild surprise. My sex, in other words, didn't seem 
to be an absolute fact so much as a pleasant, recurring accident. 
</P>
<P>
 By the age of 8, I'd experienced this groggy phenomenon several times. Those 
ethereal moments above my bed made waking up in the tangled blankets, a boy 
steeped in body heat, all the more astonishing. That this might be an unusual 
experience never occurred to me; it was one among a flood of sensations I could 
neither name nor ignore. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, shocked as I was when those transvestites passed me in front of 
Burl's, they confirmed something about which I already had an inkling: the hazy 
border between the sexes. My father, after all, raised his pinky when he drank 
from a teacup, and my mother looked as faded and plain as my father until she 
fixed her hair and painted her face. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most children, I once thought it possible to divide the world into male 
and female columns. Blue/Pink. Rooster/Hens. Trousers/Skirts. Such divisions 
were easy, not to mention comforting, for they simplified matter into 
compatible pairs. But there also existed a vast range of things that didn't fit 
neatly into either camp: clocks, milk, telephones, grass. There were nights I 
fell into a fitful sleep while trying to sex the world correctly. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing typified the realms of male and female as clearly as my parents' 
walk-in closets. Home alone for any length of time, I always found my way 
inside them. I could stare at my parents' clothes for hours, grateful for the 
stillness and silence, haunting the very heart of their privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 The overhead light in my father's closet was a bare bulb. Whenever I groped 
for the chain in the dark, it wagged back and forth and resisted my grasp. Once 
the light clicked on, I saw dozens of ties hanging like stalactites. A 
monogrammed silk bathrobe sagged from a hook, a gift my father had received on 
a long-ago birthday and, thinking it fussy, rarely wore. Shirts were cramped 
together along the length of an aluminum pole, their starched sleeves sticking 
out as if in a half-hearted gesture of greeting. The medicinal odor of 
mothballs permeated the boxer shorts that were folded and stacked in a built-in 
drawer. Immaculate underwear was proof of a tenderness my mother couldn't 
otherwise express; she may not have touched my father often, but she laundered 
his boxers with infinite care. Even back then, I suspected that a sense of duty 
was the final erotic link between them. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in a neat row on the closet floor were my father's boots and slippers 
and dress shoes. I'd try on his wingtips and clomp around, slipping out of them 
with every step. My wary, unnatural stride made me all the more desperate to 
effect some authority. I'd whisper orders to imagined lackeys and take my 
invisible wife in my arms. But no matter how much I wanted them to fit, those 
shoes were as cold and hard as marble. 
</P>
<P>
 My mother's shoes were just as uncomfortable, but a lot more fun. From a 
brightly colored array of pumps and sling-backs, I'd pick a pair with the glee 
and deliberation of someone choosing a chocolate. Whatever embarrassment I felt 
was overwhelmed by the exhilaration of being taller in a pair of high heels. 
Things will look like this someday, I said to myself, gazing out from my new 
and improved vantage point as if from a crow's nest. Calves elongated, arms 
akimbo, I gauged each step so that I didn't fall over and moved with what might 
have passed for grace had someone seen me, a possibility I scrupulously avoided 
by locking the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Back and forth I went. The longer I wore a pair of heels, the better my 
balance. In the periphery of my vision, the shelf of wigs looked like a throng 
of kindly bystanders. Light streamed down from a high window, causing crystal 
bottles to glitter, the air ripe with perfume. A makeup mirror above the 
dressing table invited my self-absorption. Sound was muffled. Time slowed. It 
seemed as if nothing bad could happen as long as I stayed within those walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Though I'd never been discovered in my mother's closet, my parents knew that I 
was drawn toward girlish things -- dolls and jump-rope and jewelry -- as well 
as to the games and preoccupations that were expected of a boy. I'm not sure 
now if it was my effeminacy itself that bothered them as much as my ability to 
slide back and forth, without the slightest warning, between male and female 
mannerisms. After I'd finished building the model of an F-17 bomber say, I'd 
sit back to examine my handiwork, pursing my lips in concentration and crossing 
my legs at the knee. 
</P>
<P>
 One day my mother caught me standing in the middle of my bedroom doing an 
imitation of Mary Injijikian, a dark, overeager Armenian girl with whom I 
believed myself to be in love, not only because she was pretty, but because I 
wanted to be like her. Collector of effortless A's, Mary seemed to know all the 
answers in class. Before the teacher had even finished asking a question, Mary 
would let out a little grunt and practically levitate out of her seat, as if 
her hand were filled with helium. "Could we please hear from someone else today 
besides Miss Injijikian," the teacher would say. Miss Injijikian . Those were 
the words I was repeating over and over to myself when my mother caught me. To 
utter them was rhythmic, delicious, and under their spell I raised my hand and 
wiggled like Mary. I heard a cough and spun around. My mother froze in the 
doorway. She clutched the folded sheets to her stomach and turned without 
saying a word. My sudden flush of shame confused me. Weren't boys supposed to 
swoon over girls? Hadn't I seen babbling, heartsick men in a dozen movies? 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the Injijikian incident, my parents decided to send me to 
gymnastics class at the Los Angeles Athletic Club, a brick relic of a building 
on Olive Street. One of the oldest establishments of its kind in Los Angeles, 
the club prohibited women from the premises. My parents didn't have to say it 
aloud: they hoped a fraternal atmosphere would toughen me up and tilt me toward 
the male side of my nature. 
</P>
<P>
 My father drove me Downtown so I could sign up for the class, meet the 
instructor and get a tour of the place. On the way there, he reminisced about 
sports. Since he'd grown up in a rough Philadelphia neighborhood, sports 
consisted of kick-the-can or rolling a hoop down the street with a stick. The 
more he talked about his physical prowess, the more convinced I became that my 
daydreams and shyness were a disappointment to him. 
</P>
<P>
 The hushed lobby of the athletic club was paneled in dark wood. A few solitary 
figures were hidden in wing-chairs. My father and I introduced ourselves to a 
man at the front desk who seemed unimpressed by our presence. His aloofness 
unnerved me, which wasn't hard considering that, no matter how my parents put 
it, I knew their sending me here was a form of disapproval, a way of banishing 
the part of me they didn't care to know. 
</P>
<P>
 A call went out over the intercom for someone to show us around. While we 
waited, I noticed that the sand in the standing ashtrays had been raked into 
perfect furrows. The glossy leaves of the potted plants looked as if they'd 
been polished by hand. The place seemed more like a well-tended hotel than an 
athletic club. Finally, a stoop-shouldered old man hobbled toward us, his head 
shrouded in a cloud of white hair. He wore a T-shirt that said "Instructor"; 
his arms were so wrinkled and anemic, I thought I might have misread it. While 
we followed him to the elevator -- it would be easier, he said, than taking the 
stairs -- I readjusted my expectations, which had involved fantasies of a 
hulking drill-sergeant barking orders at a flock of scrawny boys. 
</P>
<P>
 We got off the elevator on the second floor. The instructor, mumbling to 
himself and never turning around to see if we were behind him, showed us where 
the gymnastics class took place. I'm certain the building was big, but the size 
of the room must be exaggerated by a trick of memory, because when I envision 
it, I picture a vast and windowless warehouse. Mats covered the wooden floor. 
Here and there, in remote and lonely pools of light, stood a pommel horse, a 
balance beam and parallel bars. Tiers of bleachers rose into darkness. Unlike 
the cloistered air of a closet, the room seemed incomplete without a crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Next we visited the dressing room, empty except for a naked middle-aged man. 
He sat on a narrow bench and clipped his formidable toenails. Moles dotted his 
back. He glistened like a fish. 
</P>
<P>
 We continued to follow the instructor down an aisle lined with numbered 
lockers. At the far end, steam billowed from the doorway that led to the 
showers. Fresh towels stacked on a nearby table made me think of my mother; I 
knew she liked to have me at home with her -- I was often her only companion -- 
and I resented her complicity in the plan to send me here. 
</P>
<P>
 The tour ended when the instructor gave me a sign-up sheet. Only a few names 
preceded mine. They were signatures, or so I imagined, of other soft and 
wayward sons. 
</P>
<P>
 When the day of the first gymnastics class arrived, my mother gave me money 
and a gym bag (along with a clean towel, she'd packed a banana and a napkin) 
and sent me to the corner of Hollywood and Western to wait for a bus. The sun 
was bright, the traffic heavy. While I sat there, an argument raged inside my 
head, the familiar, battering debate between the wish to be like other boys and 
the wish to be like myself. Why shouldn't I simply get up and go back home, 
where I'd be left alone to read and think? On the other hand, wouldn't life be 
easier if I liked athletics, or learned to like them? No sooner did I steel my 
resolve to get on the bus than I thought of something better: I could spend the 
morning wandering through Woolworth's, then tell my parents I'd gone to the 
class. But would my lie stand up to scrutiny? As I practiced describing phantom 
gymnastics -- And then we did cartwheels and boy was I dizzy -- I became aware 
of a car circling the block. It was a large car in whose shaded interior I 
could barely make out the driver, but I thought it might be the man who owned 
the local pet store. I'd often gone there on the pretext of looking at the 
cocker spaniel puppies huddled together in their pen, but I really went to gawk 
at the owner, whose tan chest, in the V of his shirt, was the place I most 
wanted to rest my head. Every time the man moved, counting stock or writing a 
receipt, his shirt parted, my mouth went dry, and I smelled the musk of sawdust 
and dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 I found myself hoping that the driver was the man who ran the pet store. I was 
thrilled by the unlikely possibility that the sight of me, slumped on a bus 
bench in my T-shirt and shorts, had caused such a man to circle the block. Up 
to that point in my life, lovemaking hovered somewhere in the future, an 
impulse a boy might aspire to but didn't indulge. And there I was, sitting on a 
bus bench in the middle of the city, dreaming I could seduce an adult. I 
showered the owner of the pet store with kisses and, as aquariums bubbled, 
birds sang, and mice raced in a wire wheel, slipped my hand beneath his shirt. 
The roar of traffic brought me to my senses. I breathed deeply and blinked 
against the sun. I crossed my legs at the knee in order to hide an erection. My 
fantasy left me both drained and changed. The continent of sex had drifted 
closer. 
</P>
<P>
 The car made another round. This time the driver leaned across the passenger 
seat and peered at me through the window. He was a complete stranger whose gaze 
filled me with fear. It wasn't the surprise of not recognizing him that 
frightened me, it was what I did recognize -- the unmistakable shame in his 
expression, and the weary temptation that drove him in circles. Before the car 
behind him honked, he mouthed "hello" and cocked his head. What now, he seemed 
to be asking. A bold, unbearable question. 
</P>
<P>
 I bolted to my feet, slung the gym bag over my shoulder and hurried toward 
home. Now and then I turned around to make sure he wasn't trailing me, both 
relieved and disappointed when I didn't see his car. Even after I became 
convinced that he wasn't at my back -- my sudden flight had scared him off -- I 
kept turning around to see what was making me so nervous, as if I might spot 
the source of my discomfort somewhere on the street. I walked faster and 
faster, trying to outrace myself. Eventually, the bus I was supposed to have 
taken roared past. Turning the corner, I watched it bob eastward. 
</P>
<P>
 Closing the kitchen door behind, me, I vowed never to leave home again. I was 
resolute in this decision without fully understanding why, or what it was I 
hoped to avoid; I was only aware of the need to hide and a vague notion, fading 
fast, the my trouble had something to do with sex. Already the mechanism of 
self-deception was at work. By the time my mother rushed into the kitchen to 
see why I'd returned so early, the thrill I'd felt while waiting for the bus 
had given way to indignation. 
</P>
<P>
 I poured out the story of the man circling the block and protested, with 
perhaps too great a passion, my own innocence. "I was just sitting there," I 
said again and again. I was so determined to deflect suspicion away from 
myself, and to justify my missing the class, that I portrayed the man as a 
grizzled pervert who drunkenly veered from lane to lane as he followed me 
halfway home. 
</P>
<P>
 My mother cinched her housecoat. She seemed moved and shocked by what I told 
her, if a bit incredulous, which prompted me to be more dramatic. "It wouldn't 
be safe," I insisted, "for me to wait at the bus stop again." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how overwrought my story, I knew my mother wouldn't question it, 
wouldn't bring the subject up again; sex of any kind, especially sex between a 
man and a boy, was simply not discussed in our house. The gymnastics class, my 
parents agreed, was something I could do another time. 
</P>
<P>
 And so I spent the remainder of that summer at home with my mother, stirring 
cake batter, holding the dust pan, helping her fold the sheets. For a while I 
was proud of myself for engineering a reprieve from the athletic club. But as 
the days wore on, I began to see that my mother had wanted me with her all 
along, and forcing that to happen wasn't such a feat. Soon a sense of 
compromise set in; by expressing disgust for the man in the car, I'd expressed 
disgust for an aspect of myself. Now I had all the time in the world to sit 
around and contemplate my desire for men. The days grew long and stifling and 
hot, an endless sentence of self-examination. 
</P>
<P>
 Only trips to the pet store offered any respite. Every time I went there, I 
was too electrified with longing to think about longing in the abstract. The 
bell tinkled above the door, animals stirred within their cages, and the 
handsome owner glanced up from his work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I handed my father the Herald. He opened the paper and disappeared behind it. 
My mother stirred her coffee and sighed. She gazed at the sweltering passers-by 
and probably thought herself lucky. I slid into the vinyl booth and took my 
place beside my parents. 
</P>
<P>
 For a moment, I considered asking them about what had happened on the street, 
but they would have reacted with censure and alarm, and I sensed there was more 
to the story than they'd ever be willing to tell me. Men in dresses were only 
the tip of the iceberg. Who knew what other wonders existed -- a boy, for 
example, who wanted to kiss a man -- exceptions the world did its best to keep 
hidden. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be years before I heard the word transvestite , so I struggled to 
find a word for what I'd seen. He-she came to mind, as lilting as Injijikian . 
Burl's would have been perfect, like boys and girls spliced together, but I 
can't claim to have thought of this back then. 
</P>
<P>
 I must have looked stricken as I tried to figure it all out, because my mother 
put down her coffee cup and asked if I was OK. She stopped just short of 
feeling my forehead. I assured her I was fine, but something within me had 
shifted, had given way to a heady doubt. When the waitress came and slapped 
down our check -- "Thank You," it read, "Dine out more often" -- I wondered if 
her lofty hairdo or the breasts on which her name tag quaked were real. Wax 
carnations bloomed at every table. Phony wood paneled the walls. Plastic food 
sat in a display case: fried eggs, a hamburger sandwich, a sundae topped with a 
garish cherry.

HOMES OF THEIR OWN; WHEN ARCHITECTS HOUSE THEMSELVES, THEY TOO FACE BUDGET, 
SITE AND DESIGN HURDLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael Webb, Michael Webb is the author of Architects House Themselves: 
Breaking New Ground, published this year by National Trust. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "A good house," wrote architect Charles Moore, "speaks not just of the 
materials from which it is made, but of the intangible rhythms, spirits and 
dreams of people's lives. Its site is only a tiny piece of the real world, yet 
this place is made to seem like an entire world." Moore died last year while 
planning his seventh house, but each of his six previous residences, designed 
while he taught at UC Berkeley, Yale, UCLA and the University of Texas, tells a 
story of the man and the place where it was built. 
</P>
<P>
 Few of us can afford our dream house, but we might all benefit if more of us 
followed Moore's advice to expose our dreams and fantasies. Self-expression 
once abounded in Los Angeles, but today, invention and exuberance are often 
crushed by censorious committees, a fear of what the neighbors might think or 
simply hard times. Architects from Thomas Jefferson to Frank Gehry showed the 
way when they took chances on their own houses, responding to site, 
surroundings, needs and personal tastes. 
</P>
<P>
 For John Ruble, a partner in the Santa Monica firm of Moore Ruble Yudell, the 
Venice bungalow he bought seven years ago was "all I could afford, but a little 
too funky." The rooms were tiny, the structure decayed. His plans to remodel it 
were inspired by the light, breezy houses and lush gardens he saw during a 
vacation in the Caribbean. 
</P>
<P>
 The remodel became a rebuild that preserved only a couple of walls and a few 
windows but stayed within the original footprint. "I wanted to show how you 
could add to a little house like this without destroying its role in the 
neighborhood," Ruble says. A pedimented porch embraces the street front, 
playing off the mix of styles to either side, and the narrow addition is 
situated to the back and crowned with a balustrade of the same Chinese 
latticework that fills the pediment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted a few colonial touches and a suggestion of a plantation house to 
remind me of my home state of Virginia," Ruble says. He has created a house 
that is playful without being cute, a mix of East and West coasts. The wood 
deck serves as an entry hall, from which visitors step into the main room with 
its pitched ceiling. Wood pilasters and a low divide define an intimate sitting 
room. A conical skylight gives it the feeling of a conservatory. Two more 
pilasters frame the stair hall, which is flanked by the kitchen and his son's 
bedroom. Space flows around these divisions, which make the room feel much 
larger than it is.  
</P>
<P>
 Ruble and his wife, Cecily Young, are still adding to the house and 
discovering how to use it. "Sometimes we'll spend weeks living upstairs, 
treating the bedroom-study as a one-room house," he says. "A house should have 
a rich series of places, and not force you to live in just one way." 
</P>
<P>
 Raquel Vert was challenged by her husband, Chaim Meital, to enlarge their '50s 
ranch house in the foothills of Encino. Born in Tel Aviv, Vert worked for 
several radical architects in Los Angeles before setting up her own practice in 
Santa Monica and winning commissions for ambitious houses. Rough masonry and 
daring angles are combined in this fusion of old and new. Like Ruble, she 
extended the house upward, raising the height of the hall and living areas, and 
inserting an upstairs office and new master bedroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal was to add as much usable space for her, her husband and their two 
children as could be squeezed from a tight budget. Split concrete-block walls 
conceal the steps that lead down from the street, enclose the forecourt and 
flow through a sheet of glass that lights the lofty entry hall. An entrance 
that was formerly cramped and exposed is now spacious and private. More 
concealed steps flow up to the gallery-like office that is lit by big corner 
windows and screened by mature trees. The hall leads back to the central dining 
room with its 20-foot arched vault of fir studs. A living room that used to be 
dark and claustrophobic is now flooded with light from a window wall that faces 
north over the San Fernando Valley, and from a skylight tucked into the angles 
of the old roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Vert is proud of the economies she achieved by using industrial-grade oak and 
bulk-rate Italian limestone for the floors, birch ply for the cabinets and 
steel-troweled stucco to tie together old and new. The concealed lights that 
play off rough textures and dramatize the lofty rooms were $3 each at a 
hardware store. The simple practicality of these materials enhances the impact 
of a glass-topped dining table by Carlo Scarpa, the legendary Italian designer, 
and a few favorite chairs and artworks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I could have gone further," Vert says. A lot of her custom furnishings 
remain unfinished, but she is pleased by how much she was able to do and how 
well the house survived the earthquake that shook down several of its 
neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first house you build for yourself is always overloaded with ideas," says 
Barton Phelps, "and the experience of building it is a mixture of paranoia and 
catharsis." Phelps, who worked for Gehry and Moore before setting up his own 
varied practice in mid-Wilshire, bought a small kite-shaped lot halfway up a 
steep canyon in West Los Angeles. He wanted a house for himself and his wife, 
Karen Simonson, that would open up to the sun and allow one to look out or step 
out into the landscape at every level. It also had to bridge a ravine that can 
flood during heavy rains. Phelps' success made his reputation as someone who 
could master "unbuildable" sites. 
</P>
<P>
 He decided to abstract a traditional Spanish colonial house, creating a pair 
of two-story pavilions with stucco walls and red-shingle roofs. These are 
fanned out to the south and separated by a patio that serves as an outdoor room 
(with a bamboo canopy in summer). A stairway winds up the slope -- its shiny 
green vinyl coating suggesting the ripples of a creek -- linking carport and 
kitchen-dining at the base, to the master bedroom halfway up and the living 
room at the top. From here, a deck (now enclosed as a study for his wife) leads 
back to his study and their daughter's bedroom above the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 The simple volumes generate an effect of great complexity as visitors move 
around and through them. The whimsical, cut-away entrance facade turns into a 
sheer north wall that bows with the slope and is pierced by tiny openings that 
trace the line of the stair. The south face is open and irregular. Additions 
and a new standing-seam roof of lead-coated copper have given the house a 
crisper look. 
</P>
<P>
 Each room has a distinct personality. The deeply coffered ceiling of the 
dining room contrasts with the bowed wood vault of the master bedroom and the 
coved, skylit vault of the living room. Says Phelps: "As you walk up, you feel 
you are leaving the city for a civilized place in the woods." 
</P>
<P>
 Buzz Yudell studied with Charles Moore at Yale and joined him and John Ruble 
as a partner in Los Angeles; his wife, Tina Beebe, is a colorist, a graphic 
designer and a passionate gardener. They had been living in a 600-square-foot 
bungalow in Santa Monica and looking along the coast until -- in 1982 -- they 
found an affordable site in the Malibu hills where they could live, as Yudell 
describes it, "in close partnership with the landscape and the climate." 
</P>
<P>
 The buildable area was 600 feet long and, with setbacks, less than 40 feet 
wide. Inspired by the simple, linear forms of Mediterranean and Californian 
farmhouses -- and by an elongated greenhouse next door -- they decided to make 
the most of the skinny site. A detached studio and citrus orchard anchor the 
north end. Visitors enter the house through a walled courtyard. Entry hall, 
guest bedroom and study are stacked to form a tower. A succession of carefully 
proportioned rooms step down the slope, opening off a gallery that is large 
enough to entertain in. This layout is mirrored outside by a stepped path and a 
series of pergolas. These outdoor rooms form a green wall for the garden, which 
descends into a dry creek. 
</P>
<P>
 The house, like Phelps', takes its cues from the site and traditional 
buildings and is tailored to the personalities of its owners. The silvery metal 
roof plays off the faded terra-cotta walls, gray-green trim and native 
plantings, achieving the timeless feel of an old Mediterranean villa. Space 
cascades down the path and gallery and through the French doors at each level, 
weaving together indoors and outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 "A house is for people and the things you do in it," says Julie Eizenberg, who 
heads a flourishing residential and institutional practice in Santa Monica with 
her husband, Hank Koning. The couple graduated from the university in their 
native Melbourne before coming to study and later to teach at UCLA. The house 
they built for themselves and their two small sons, a mile from the office, was 
conceived as basic shelter, ranged along the north side of a lot and opened up 
to nature and sunlight. They were inspired by Australian homesteads in which 
shady verandas give depth to plain brick boxes and by the "flounder houses" of 
Virginia that turn away from the street and face sideways over rectangular 
lots. Neighboring houses were set back from the street, but the architects were 
determined to make the best use of their plot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hank and I are pathetic romantics," Eizenberg says, "who make houses that 
feel right, are moody, shadowy and have places to hang out." Their own house 
has those intangible qualities and a loose-fitting practicality that 
accommodates messiness and change. Kitchen, dining and family room are one 
space, opening through the porch into the garden. Stairs lead up to 
barrel-vaulted bedrooms that open off a well-ventilated gallery. 
</P>
<P>
 A glass "hinge" links the trunk of the house to its head -- a studio over a 
living room -- which looks out to the street. "We weren't sure we were ready 
for a grown-up place," Eizenberg acknowledges now, "but it's worked out well 
for us and the children." Trumpet vines and roses have grown over the green 
block, and the metal veranda, inspired by Claude Monet's at Giverny in France, 
has become a soft sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
 We can all learn something from what these architects have done, whether or 
not we'd like to live in their houses. One lesson is to please yourself without 
annoying others. Building a house for resale or to show off is like buying art 
for investment rather than the pleasure it brings. A house can be very 
different from its neighbors but still fit in, and its interiors can be as 
personal as the clothes one wears. Even with children, there's no need to 
divide the space into little rooms or shut out the sun. Architects are 
inventive cheapskates when it comes to decoration, saving their money to 
maximize light and space, good proportions, a sense of movement and surprise. 
Over the years, these intangibles are likely to enrich life much more than a 
lot of fancy trim.

PALM LATITUDES: THE BODY POLITIC; BATTLE OF THE BINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Recycling seemed so easy, so anxiety-free. Residents would stash their 
bottles, cans and paper in city-provided bins. The cities would take the 
contents and send them off to be recycled. Everyone was supposed to feel good. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone doesn't. The programs, implemented after the state ordered cities to 
cut back the junk they sent to landfills, are reducing the trash flow but they 
are also adding to Southern Californians' Angst. Scavengers' pre-dawn sorties 
are upsetting the rubbish cart. 
</P>
<P>
 Cities, which face heavy fines if they don't meet state goals, worry that 
people seeking to thwart scavengers will return to their un-green ways and put 
recyclables in the regular trash. 
</P>
<P>
 Many residents see scavengers as intruders, scary ones. "What's to stop them 
from taking something from my garage or my yard?" asks one homeowner. Marilyn 
McGuire, an L.A. refuse official, has cited worries that scavengers "may be 
casing their places to come back later and burglarize." 
</P>
<P>
 Cities, trying to crack down on organized bands of scavengers, are asking 
residents to report them. Los Angeles, which has recycling programs in more 
than 80% of the city, gets about 300 calls a month. Penalties go as high as 
$1,000 and six months in jail. Police have issued citations, but no one has yet 
done time for bin pilferage. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all the calls are about bin gangs. What to do about a family looking 
for a few bucks for a meal? "It's a very touchy issue. No one's been able to 
solve it," says Lisa Constande, environmental conservation manager for Palm 
Desert. "It pulls at your heartstrings to see a person with their kids taking 
the aluminum and glass."  
</P>
<P>
 Joe Delaney, solid waste supervisor for Beverly Hills, says city officials 
have a responsibility to the taxpayers and must "keep conscience in check" 
about scavengers. "They are homeless and they are poor but maybe what they're 
doing isn't best for everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Constande notes that scavengers must turn their booty in at a recycling 
center, so "it's still getting recycled. That's my only solace in all this." 
</P>
<P>
 In Beverly Hills, by the way, only about 50% of the scavengers are homeless or 
poor, says Delaney. No word on how many of the rest are tabloid reporters.

PALM LATITUDES: BOTTOM LINE; BAWDY AND SOUL

 Playmates is just a garter belt's snap from Frederick's of Hollywood on the 
Walk of Fame, but more than geography separates these two giants of Spandex and 
lace; they were on opposite sides of the karmic divide, at least during the 
L.A. riots. Frederick's was looted, but Playmates, home to corsets and teddies 
and Buddhist shrines, was untouched. 
</P>
<P>
 This "lingerie temple" is run by devout Buddhist and onetime monk Michael 
Attie. It's filled with eye-popping merchandise and glitzy shrines to various 
Buddhist and Hindu deities. Shoppers are encouraged to light some incense and 
pray as they browse among the Merry Widows and easy-access underthings.  
</P>
<P>
 Attie offers a 10% discount to people who attend his free meditation 
workshops, which he holds every week above his store. "There's no better place 
to seek enlightenment than a lingerie store like Playmates, Attie says. "It can 
be a place to help people work out their sexual karma. A person stops by the 
store and their sexual energy is aroused, so they won't fall asleep when they 
meditate. Their mind is already focused on one thing, sex, so it's a short 
journey to refocus their mind on the formless heart of everything, the source." 
</P>
<P>
 Attie traveled throughout Asia for years on his journey to enlightenment, 
living in ashrams, shaving his head and even enduring scourgings-beatings with 
a stick to help him focus on his path toward purification. When his father left 
him the family business more than a decade ago, he began to transform it into a 
celebration of his faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever you do is your worship," says Attie. "Whatever happens in life is 
your perfect lesson; it's your karma unfolding, and that's what Playmates has 
been for me." Ivy Brown

 The Warriors did not lose last season until they reached the State Division II 
final. Duplicating that feat depends on whether the four returning starters can 
fill the leadership void left by graduated guard Jamie Oenning, who led the 
team with an average of 13.5 points. But Burgess averaged 13.3 points and 12.4 
rebounds, Pearson averaged 11 points and eight rebounds, and Bangs' lineup will 
be deeper with the addition of two transfers, DuPerron and Christensen. "Both 
of them are real steady players," Bangs said. "Being able to go seven, eight, 
nine deep makes a difference. We were about six-deep last year." Weaver, who 
had a solid performance in the playoffs last season, tore her anterior cruciate 
ligament the week of the State final and is not at full strength yet. Bangs 
said his team is motivated by last season's only loss, but it has worked very 
hard and likely could be better this season. SCHEDULE

THE LAST DAYS OF RANCHO DE LOS DIABLOS; THE LARGEST MIGRANT CAMP IN SOUTHERN 
CALIFORNIA WAS BULLDOZED THIS MONTH -- ONE MORE TWIST IN A HISTORY AND FABLE IN

 No morning at Rancho de los Diablos really begins until Don Trino descends 
into the canyon at a few minutes past 4 in his red-and-silver lunch truck. 
Before any light, before the roosters crow on the eastern side of the camp, don 
Trino parks near two eucalyptus trees and waits silently in the cab. Until it 
was razed this fall, Rancho de los Diablos, which stretched for seven-tenths of 
a mile along the bottom of Mc Gonigle Canyon in the northwest corner of the 
city of San Diego, was the largest-and perhaps oldest migrant camp in Southern 
California. At its height, in the late '70s, the camp had as many as 2,000 
residents. By this summer, the population stood at 600. As a 20 year-old 
squatters camp located on private property, it was always a center of 
controversy. City officials called it a health hazard. Nearby homeowners 
targeted it as a drag on property values and a magnet for crime. Advocacy 
groups rallied around it as a glaring example of San Diego's failure to provide 
adequate housing for immigrant laborers-the backbone of the area's $800-million 
agricultural industry. This spring, after years of task forces and resolution, 
the city finally decided to relocate 39 families and level the camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the 200 or so other encampments that account for 15,000 migrants 
throughout San Diego county, Rancho de los Diablos evolved from a bachelors 
society to an organized community that included not just field hands, gardeners 
and day laborers but also women and children. Several years ago, as advocacy 
groups improved living conditions and promised the construction of better 
housing, the men, most of whom are legal residents, brought their families up 
from Mexico. By the end, services included weekly check cashing, a credit 
system, trash pickup, toilets, colar- and generator-powered electricity, Avon 
delivery, a water system, student carpools, and elected town council, a brothel 
under the stars, a local marijuana patch, fake green cards, a vibrant trade in 
crystal methaphetamine and daily patrols by the San Diego Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's bit of everything here," one resident told me with a smile, betraying 
amusement and amazement bordering on outrage. she wasn't just rendering to her 
fellow residents, but to the baptisms and quincianeras, first Communions wand 
weddings, deaths and fires that have marked the camp's history. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the last bulldozers came in late October and cleared away 401 
cardboard, plywood, plastic and metal-sided shacks, a medical clinic, six 
restaurants, two soccer fields, four basketball courts and a volleyball court, 
the communal bathhouse and general store, the men had already erected a new 
camp less than a mile away. It's happened this way for 20 years. The city or 
the growers tear down a camp and another sprouts up. So, the destruction of 
Rancho de los Diablos this fall was really only a twist in the plot of a story 
that spans three decades. It is a verdadera historia, truly a story, because it 
is history and fable in progress that begins with a low point for Cesar Chavez 
and turns on the feudal living conditions of most farm workers in San diego 
County.

 Just Down The Road From Don Trino's lunch truck, Dona Adelina rises from the 
wooden pallet that she shares with her husband, Don Cidronio, slides her feet 
into worn black flats and turns on a flashlight. Quietly, so as not to wake her 
16-year-old son, who sleeps on the other side of a partition, she removes the 
chain from the door of her family's three-room canton, shack. Once outside , 
she dips water from a metal drum to wash her hands and face, slicks the excess 
water into her medium-length black hair and brushes her teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-six years old, Dona Adelina has a wide, stern face and a down-turned 
mouth. Shen she meets you for the first time, she looks at you from the corner 
of her eyes, like a farmer sizing up a stranger. She arrived at Rancho de los 
Diablos in 1992 from Zacatetan, in the state of Guerrero, to join her husband, 
who had become a legal resident under amnesty. With her eldest daughters 
married, there was no reason to remain separated from Don Cidronio nine months 
of the year. "After so many years of hearing about America," She says, "I 
wanted to see what people were talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the low-slung canton, she lights a white candle and clicks on the 
pocket transistor radio to a local banda station. Wrappping a towel around her 
head to keep from catching cold, she returns outside to kindle a fire in the 
horno, the squat clay oven she made when she first arrived at the camp. She 
feeds more wood into the mouth of the oven, which is covered with a round metal 
griddle cut from the top of the nearby drum, and the smell of burning wood 
mingles with the crip morning air. when the first man stumbles form his canton 
don Trino walks to the back of the truck. "How's it going?" he asks absently as 
he lifts the back section. "Well, I'm here," replies a slightly built man who 
stands above the ashes of a long dead bonfire and hugs himself from the morning 
cold. Trino opens the long side of the ruck and, without a word, throws out 
empty cartons into the pile of ashes. The haggard man tears the boxes, pulls a 
lighter from his shirt pocket and starts a fire. to keep it going, don Trino 
piles on grocery bags and plastic foam cups as the man stoops at the edge of 
the flames, his shining face partially obscured by the stings of black smoke 
rising from the burning plastic. 
</P>
<P>
 At 5, Son Cidronio emerges from the doorway and mumbles "Buenos dias" to Dona 
Adelina. A short, wide man, with a stomach that juts out just below his chest 
and hangs over his belt, he sits down to eat the oatmeal his wife has spooned 
into a Campbell's soup mug. The men of the camp often confuse Don Cidronios 
generosity and good nature for comical stupidity. but those have been precisely 
the qualities that have sustained him during his 20 years at the camp-he is one 
of its two earliest residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Up and down the road, men who cannot endure the face-twisting stench of the 
portable toilet follow footpaths into high weeds to relieve themselves. They 
carry handfuls of toilet paper, old newspaper and crumpled brown paper bags to 
use when the squat, their hats dipping below the top of the weeds. 
</P>
<P>
 When Don Cidronio finishes his breakfast, Dona Adelina hands him a jar of pink 
Jergens There Way All Purpose Face and Beauty Cream that he rubs on his face, 
neck and arms for protection from the sun. she then pours a stew of eggs, chile 
and tomatoes into his thermos and packs it into a nylon backpack. Don Cidronio 
pulls a flannel shirt over a blue T-shirt. "Do you have everything father?" she 
asks. "he answers, walking toward the road. Dona Adelina, with arms folded, 
watches the procession of men converge on Don Trino's fiyuqua, lunch truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the truck, men make instant Necafe and dip maria cookies into their 
cups. They greet each other with nicknames and nods. Some fill plastic bags 
with sweet bread, soda and burritos. Few pay. son Trino stands nearby with a 
notebook in hand and enters the merchandise brought. When a man his just 
cruzado la Linea, crossed the border, he can open a line of credit with Don 
Trino if he has work with los diablos, the devils, the Ukegawa family, who run 
tomato strawberry, cucumber and bean fields from Del Mar to San Luis Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 Clumps of men start to walk toward the Carmel Valley cucumber fields. Others 
ride bikes up Black Mountain Road, Climb onto the backs of pickups and cram 
themselves into aging cars. And so they spread out to the east and west and 
north. Don Trino calculates the morning sales in his spiral notebook. Dona' 
Adelina returns to sleep until 8 and Don Cidronio looks out the back of a brown 
Chevy pickup on his way to the fields. Only later will his wife remind him that 
it is his 60th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Carmel Valley, a mile and a half west of the camp, the workday begins at 
about 6:40. Under straw hats and baseball caps, the men pick cucumbers strung 
along three-foot vines. The small spines, removed before the cucumbers reach 
the stores, can cut through cotton gloves and pierce a man's fingers, numbing 
his hands by day's end. 
</P>
<P>
 They load the cucumbers into square wooden boxes and the boxes onto 
metal-framed wheel barrows. The loaded carts are then taken to a woman in a 
straw hat, who counts the boxes and inspects the Vegetables. If she is 
satisfied with the produce, she punches a paper card that the men keep in their 
front pockets. But if a box contains too many yellow cucumbers, it will be 
discarded and noted as shoddy work. The men then unload their small crates into 
larger boxes. A forlift carries the larger boxes to a nearby flatbed truck, and 
the men return with the empty carts to refill the boxes. they bend below the 
top of the rows and do not rise again until they've filled a crate. In other 
fields, men weed, moving up and down until sweat falls from their noses and 
chins, until their backs tingle, until the pain has rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
 Other men ride into newly powered fields on flatbeds loaded with stakes. One 
crew plants the stakes in shallow holes. Another crew follows with a device 
called el nino, the baby. A man lifts the 10-pound hollow-metal nino over his 
head, holding two curved handles that look like the bent arms of an infant, and 
brings it down over the top of the stake, driving it into the ground. 
Relatively easy, this chore can also be tricky and dangerous. If a man tires 
and loses his concentration, he can hit the edge of a stake and send splinters 
flying into his face. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the short of "Apurate!" - Hurry up!-from the crew chiefs who march 
up and down the rows, the men work un silence. The only other sounds are the 
hum of the forklift and the thud of the cucumbers tumbling from box to box. 
Drinking water comes form the irrigation pipes. Many fields have no bathrooms, 
and the men are expected to relieve themselves, quickly, in the dirt. There are 
no breaks. Lunch is for 30 minutes, starting at 11, when Don Trino or another 
man from El Burrito Catering arrives. Sitting on the ground, the men tear into 
stiff burritos and tortas. With a watchful efficiency. Don Trino calculates the 
lunch sales into neat columns under each man's name. When the foremen call out, 
the day continues until 4. By then, it will take some of the older men almost 
the entire walk back ot the rancho to stand up straight. Every man and 
adolescent sleeps with rubbing alcohol by his bed.

 Back At The Camp, with two speakers, a 300-watt amplifier and a CD player 
powered by a buzzing generator, Ramiro straddles a microphone stand and croons 
a string of rancheras, nortenas and American standards. He practices from 9 
until noon under the blue tarp next to El Restaurante del Chivo. With a round 
face, curly brown hair, a small scar on the right side of his chin and a plump 
little nose, Ramiro had been at the camp off and on for 19 years. He is now 34 
years old and goes by the nickname la gringa and, in the cosmos of Rancho de 
los Diablos, he is the mobile entrepreneur. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Rancho Penasquitos, the nearest school district, won't send buses up 
dirt roads, Ramiro shuttles about 30 of the camp's school-aged children in his 
1966 Dodges Monaco every morning. He charges $2 a day for each child; he also 
drives men to the fields, charging them $4 round-trip. His most clever venture, 
though, is the afternoon football game that he runs at the dusty field on the 
western side of the camp. He is the game's concessionaire as well as its 
announcer. 
</P>
<P>
 To play, each man must hand Ramiro $2. In exchange, the winning players get 
two free beers. "Here we are at the Devil's Cup," he intones at the start of 
every game, "brought to you by Budweiser, the King of Beers..." The game 
consists of only one period; the first team to score two goals wins, and there 
are no boundaries except when the ball is totally unplayable. The game usually 
attracts about 40 onlookers-a tough, rowdy crowd that rarely has a good word 
for the players. When a goal is scored, Ramiro booms, "Gooaaallll!!!!!mimicking 
well-known TV announcer Andres Cantor. 
</P>
<P>
 But this morning, Ramiro isn't concerned with commerce. He bends his knees and 
closes his eyes, and his baritone sails across the camp. Leaning against a 
nearby trailer, sitting on dusty plastic chairs, onlookers come and go. Ruben, 
a crackly-voiced 13-year-old, stays to taunt Ramiro. Their exchangers begin 
when Ramiro calls him a little female quail, a reference to Ruben's wet, 
slicked hair. When Ramiro sings, "Lo hice hado a mimanera," the 
Spanish-language version of "My Way," Ruben shouts, "Come on, maricon. Let's 
go, you faggot. Come on, Gloria Trevi, throw out your calzones. Throw out your 
panties." 
</P>
<P>
 Just across the creed from Don Trino;s truck, Ruben's 7-year-old sister, 
Angelica, wearing a red dress and high black boots, twirls from a yellow rope 
that hangs from a tree branch. Her older sister, Rubicelia, sits on a shaky 
wooden chair and reads mail from her grandparents in Arcelia, Guerrero. "I miss 
hem," she says. "I want to go back." 
</P>
<P>
 Rubicelia and her mother, Angelita, have pored over the letter a dozen times. 
A quiet, watchful woman with a broad red face and and even line of white teeth, 
Angelita came north with her children two years ago. Her husband had been 
living in the camp since 1977, and she only saw him during the winter. he was 
sleeping with other women, Angelita says, leaning her face onto the side of her 
hands. He was drinking, she says, gesturing with her hands a if lifting a 
bottle to her lips. "There were months and months when we didn't get any money, 
when there was no food in the house. As an adult I could bear it, but the 
children suffered. There was on day, i remember, when we didn't even have salt. 
it was then i decided to come with the children. i figured at least they would 
eat." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramiro, who has been overhearing the conversation, shakes his head and arches 
his eyes. "Ves. Estas mujeres son muy sufridas," he says. "You see. These women 
are sufferers." 
</P>

 With His Permed black hair, red Wet'n Wild lipstick, Stetson cologne, gold 
chains and bracelets and zirconia earring studs, Felipe is the reigning queen 
of Rancho de los Diablos. At 24, he looks middle-aged, with slight bags under 
his eyes. Everyone calls him La Morena, the Black Woman. Midmorning, he walks 
through the camp in tight ash-blue Guess? shorts and a T-shirt reading Surf 
Fruit. The men whistle and jeer, saying "Hola bonita, ven aqui." Not answering, 
he sashays into the largest restaurant in the camp. 
</P>
<P>
 The eldest of seven children, Felipe came to the ranch in 1989 from a pueblo 
outside Veracruz. He used to work as an Ukegawa field hand but now cleans 
houses on Poway and Mira Mesa, towns east of the camp. His rambling canton, 
which sits on an embankment behind the soccer field, is the nearest thing to 
luxurious living at Rancho de los Diablos. Christmas streamers hang from the 
plywood ceiling. A black scalop-shaped couch dominates the living area; in one 
corner, a plywood table, covered with a tartan blanket, hold a black-and-white 
stuffed dog, a brown teddy bear, a brown stuffed pup and a ceramic blue-and 
white praying Virgin. 
</P>
<P>
 Like a Hobbit hole, Felipe's canton extends into the side of the canyon. One 
of the back rooms is a sleeping porch for the five other gay men who live 
there. His tiny bedroom is burrowed farthest into the hillside. he has 
carefully painted the walls canary yellow and the ceiling white; a bamboo 
parasol hangs over the bed. The effect is one of stately colonial decay. four 
shelves to the left of the bedroom door hold a makeup sponge, One-A Day 
Vitamins for Women, foaming Face Wash, a white candle, assorted hose (knee-high 
length), rosary beads, tasseled loafers and two pairs of black patent-leather 
pumps. The small plastic window over the bed does not open, so by midday the 
rooms is like a sauna. 
</P>
<P>
 At Dona Rosa's restaurant, Felipe sits on a long wooden bench with his lover, 
Salvador. Waiting for their lunch, they are joined by Armando, a tall, gaunt, 
bearded man who wears a dusty black cap that read "Chihuahua," his home state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, God," Felipe says in a high-pitched voice when Armando sits next to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ahi! Here's my pretty morena," Armando says leaning against Felipe's 
shoulder. "She's my girlfriend." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I'm not," Felipe says. "How are you going to maintain me?" 
</P>
<P>
 There are 10 openly gay men at the rancho. One is HIV positive. Their partners 
come from the gray area of Mexican machismo-that is, from the large number of 
men who are straight by day and gay by night. It takes a conversation with 
Cristobal to understand the unspoken rules of a camp that prides itself on 
sheltering the identity of its "heterosexual brothers." A short, frail, 
mocha-skinned man with Indian features and a head of thick black hair, 
Cristobal is slightly pigeon-toed and speaks with a lisp. He came to America in 
1989 and lost half of his right ring finger in a lawn-mower accident. Cristobal 
now picks beefsteak tomatoes in the fields. in the evenings, he cooks on a 
propane stove for a group of six men. he is 27 and, like all the men, looks 19 
years older. 
</P>
<P>
 Cristobal points out the bruises on his chest and ribs where he was beaten by 
an angry lover the week before. "He was drunk, and he hit me and kicked me on 
the ground. i ran through the camp and hid. he did it because I got tired. he's 
not gay. El is hombre. he was doing it to me. i'm gay, and he's the man. he has 
a wife and kids. he's not a homosexual." 
</P>
<P>
 Until 1990, the rancho, then located half a mile northeast of its current 
location, was exclusively a male domain, where boys became prison girlfriends. 
A lawless place where $5 prostitutes swarmed the hills on payday, where bandits 
roamed the fields in ski masks, robbing their victims at gunpoint and leaving 
them in fields miles away. As many as seven residents were killed in the course 
of a year. Back then, as now, a drunken argument could erupt into a gun or 
knife fight, and the next day the body would be found in the dust. Makeshift 
shrines with Guadalupe candles still mark the spot where many of the men fell. 
Collections were taken and the bodies sent to their pueblos for their viudas, 
hijos, padres y parientes-widows, children, parents and relatives to give them 
a proper Catholic burial. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Don Cidronio came During those years. he left Zacatetan in March, 1974, 
crossed the border in May and was working in the Ukegawa strawberry fields by 
June. he was 40 years old and a mason by trade. That year, Rancho de los 
Diablos was a nameless encampment scattered throughout a section of McGonigle 
Canyon known locally as Devil's Canyon. Don Cidronio lived in a hole covered by 
sticks and brush to avoid detection by the Border Patrol. Other men simply 
pulled plastic or tarps over sticks, hung their food in bags from trees and 
slept on the open under flea-and tick-infested blankets. Every Friday, they 
bathed in the stream where the chapel to the Virgen de Guadalupe now stands or 
washed themselves from the irrigation pip(es. they stripped down only to their 
underwear, not out of modesty but from fear of snakes. They coded crude meals 
on open fires or bought moldy burritos from Don Trino and other fiyuqueros who 
catered to the thousands of men living in the hill tips and valleys. After a 
week of training without pay, Don Cidronio worked a horse and plow, earning 70 
cents an hour. The horses were given an hour's rest, the men 30 minutes for 
lunch. When work ran behind schedule, men were harnessed and made to pull the 
plows. 
</P>
<P>
 The following year, 1975, Gov. Jerry Brown signed into law the Agricultural 
labor Relations Act, giving farm workers, for the first time in American 
history, the right to bargain collectively. On paper, the act gave undocumented 
workers who were too fearful of deportation the right to report abuses, to vote 
on union representation, file complaints and testify at Agricultural labor 
Relations Board hearings. "The law is a godsend," Cesar Chavez said. "Without 
question the best law for workers-any workers in the entire country." 
</P>
<P>
 The same year. United Farm Workers organizers came to Mc Gonigle Canyon. 
Chavez himself toured the canyon to organize against the Ukegawas. "I've seen a 
lot" he said. "But these conditions were among the worst. Disgusting. 
Inhumane." On their first visit, organizers brought food, potable water (an 
unheard of luxury) and clothes. On their second visit, they brought a large 
color television and a generator for the men to watch soccer games. Slowly, the 
men began to sign union cards. 
</P>
<P>
 But not all of them were moved by the promises of a better life." "I remember 
when the great Chavez came," says Don Costodio, a tractor operator who has been 
with the Ukegawas for 22 years and loves in a canton at the edge of the creek. 
With gray hair, gold-capped teeth and eyes always red from the dust the tractor 
kicks up, don Custodio has seen "do gooders" came and go. He is Don Cidronio's 
friend and often visits in the evening. By the time Adelina is absorbed in the 
radio, Don Custodio his teeth glinting in the candlelight-launches into his 
deatribe. 
</P>
<P>
 His father fought for one of Zapata's generals. the revolution promised to 
bring land reform. Instead, his father ended up with eight hectares of hilly, 
rocky soil that was nearly impossible to farm. The Catholic church is no good. 
They're just interested in your money. You've got to pay for everything. To get 
married. to get buried. The priests cant be trusted. The priests can't be 
trusted. They spy on peasants around the world. They say they're helping you, 
but they bring us green bread on Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 The monologue goes into the night. don Cidronio snores. Dona Adelina, a devout 
Catholic, nods absently, not wanting to argue. don Costodio strikes the final 
chords on the moral. "the poor people who do the fighting, who suffer, end up 
fighting, who suffer end up with nothing in the end. That's the way it is." 
</P>
<P>
 For Don Costodio, it all leads back to the UFW's 1975 organizing campaign. 
'they passed papers out. told us they; were going to help us. but I didn't have 
time. i had to work to feed my wife and children in Guerrero." 
</P>
<P>
 By August, 1975, Joe and Hiroshi Ukegawa had fired 57 UFW supporters, many of 
whom were "green-carders," legal workers and U.S. residents. In November, a 
union organizer woke up with a gun to his face. in 1975, two union supporters, 
Arnaldo Zavala and Jose Sandoval, tried to speak to workers. Jose Morrotte, a 
Ukegawa foreman told them to leave. As Azvala and Sandoval walked away, 
Morrotte fired a file in their direction. Morrotte later testified he was 
"target practicing." 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing serious injury to his organizers, Chavez curtailed the organizing 
drive and decided to fight his case before the newly formed Agriculture Labor 
Relations Board. The UFW charged that Ukegawa illegally fired and intimidated 
workers to hamper unionizing efforts. it took two years for the case to reach a 
hearing. in December, 1977, Joe and Hisroshi Ukegawa and their foremen took the 
stand and denied all charges. After almost a year of testimony and six months 
of deliberation, the ALRB found that "the company had engaged in such egregious 
and widespread conduct as to demonstrate a general disregard for its employees 
fundamental statutory rights." The board ordered that the Ukegawa Brothers Inc. 
reinstate 62 workers with back pay and interest. 
</P>
<P>
 But what appeared to be UFW triumph turned out to be a hollow victory. The 
Ukegawas appealed the decision and quickly won a stay. Waiting for the court 
ruling, UFW organizers returned to the fields in 1980. By then, many workers 
from the initial drive had moved on. Like Don Costodio, the now wary men only 
remembered that the UFW hadn't delivered. And this time, the Ukegawas were 
better prepared. they bulldozed roads to keep organizers out; they threatened 
field hands who picked up their lunch from the UFW co-op. By the end of the 
summer, Chavez pulled out. "I didn't want our guys in there," Chavez said. "We 
should not risk our organizers lives. it's too isolated in there, and anything 
can happen," 
</P>
<P>
 Today, 19 years later, the Ukegawa family-which, the ALRB suspects, has 
operated under the names golden Bear and Del Mar Produce and now operates 
Leslie farms Inc. is still tied up in court with the ALRB, and the Ukegawas owe 
the state at least $2,532,241 in back wages and interest from the original 
case. "It is not uncommon to see a case last this long when you see the number 
of appeals available," says kerry Donnell, regional director of the ALRB El 
centro office. "We have a big judgement....but we don't have priority. we're 
not a secured creditor like a bank." In 193, San diego tomato growers, which 
includes the Ukegwas, reported $37 million in sales. That same year, son 
cidronio earned $8,825. 
</P>
<P>
 Brothers Hiroshi and Joe Ukegawa were born in 1921 and 1926, respectively, in 
Santo Ana. When they were 21 and 16, they were interned at the Colorado River 
Relocation Center in Poston, Ariz. Hiroshi was released in 1944, Joe in 1945. 
Shortly after World War II, they began planting strawberries and tomatoes in 
northern San Diego County. their experience as internees invariably surfaces 
when they are accused of labor abuses. "I have known them since 1969," said 
William N. Sauer Jr., a Carlsbad attorney who has represented the family on 
several occasions. "These individuals suffered so much abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I'm so shocked by the allegations," he told reporters a few years 
ago. "I find them incredible." Cousins Jon, James and Joe Ukegawa, sons of the 
founders now oversee the business. (The family and its attorneys did not 
respond to any phone calls.) 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen years after the decision, Ukegawa workers earn the minimum wage 
cuatro veinticinco, $4.25 an hour. That's for a field hand, a crew chief, a 
tractor operator, a new arrival or a 20 year veteran. Before taxes, that adds 
up to $170, with take-home about $144. This salary does not cover strawberry 
picking in the Carlsbad fields. there, the men earn $1.15 a flat. It is rare 
for a man to pick more than 11 flats a day without marring the strawberries. 
that means, on average, the men earn $75.90 a week before taxes. The 
exceptional and they young can bring in as much as $90 a week. "now that we're 
picking strawberries, i can't save anything," says Alejandro flores, a 
four-year resident at the camp, holding a $75 check in his hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I don't even have money to call, only to eat. It cost $55 to $60 to 
eat a week. Breakfast is $2 a burrito, a drink. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the fiyuqua arrives, and you eat away $4 at midday. And dinner cost about 
$15, $18, $21 a week. the fiyuqua people are great. They give us credit. they 
change our checks for a dollar, $1.25. That's not bad. If you don't have a car, 
you have to pay $24 a week for a ride. We're left with simply nothing. Only for 
eating. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuatro Veinticinco also sheds light on the financial intricacies of the camp, 
where credit is an elegant system of kindness that begins with Don Trino and 
his fiyuqua and can affect any transaction in which money trades hands. Son 
Trino had been a lettuce picker outside of Phoenix when he came to San Diego 
around 1974 to help his friend with the fledgling El Burrito lunch-truck 
business. he is a large, taciturn man with curly, graying black hair, ham 
hands, a bushy mustache and a face that is frozen into a squint even on a 
cloudy day. his favorite expression is cabron, son of a bitch, which either can 
be an insult or a compliment, but punctuates almost every sentence. On the 
hottest day of summer, he wears a blue flannel shirt over a white V-neck 
undershirt. known as el bigote, the mustache, or simply ElTrino, he is a 
looming, silent presence at any impromptu gathering in the camp. Hunched over a 
picnic table, barely acknowledging the conversation around him, he eats 
sunflower sees, loudly spits the shells out, and swigs down the vinegar from a 
small jar of jalapenos. 
</P>
<P>
 One afternoon, Jimmy Ukegawa, in frameless glasses, khaki shirt and pants, 
descended into the camp in a white pickup truck. Every man, woman and child 
froze momentarily and fell silent. Ukegawa stopped near the picnic table, 
walked over to Don Trino and handed his a sheet from a yellow notepad. After he 
left and people began to breathe normally again, Trino explained that the note 
only contained the name of a man who had been overpaid. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ukegawa and El Burrito catering interests are in tertwined. Only men who 
work for the Ukegawas get credit. If a man does not square his account on 
Friday, his credit line is cut and the balance taken out of his check. if a man 
is going to be fired by the Ukegawas, the balance he owes Don Trino is 
subtracted from his check. "When I die," Don Trino likes to say, tapping his 
head, "everything is going with me."

 Don Arnulfo Duarte is a Tractor operator who came to el rancho in 1977. A 
native of Arcelia, in the state of Guerrero, he is a slow-moving man with an 
ample belly whose love for watermelons has earned him the nickname la sandia, 
the watemelon. Son Arnulfo's sleepy brown eyes and deadpan delivery undercut 
the most startling utterances that fly from his mouth. His wife, Dona Asuncion, 
came with their children, Perla and Osvaldo, in 1992. Ruddy-faced with graying 
curly hair and a considerable paunch, Mrs. Watermelon, as she is sometimes 
called, runs the family restaurant, a rambling wooden structure of makeshift 
additions that can seat 15 people. On a Friday night, though, El Restaurante 
del Chivo, the goat restaurant, serves as many as 50 customers who have come 
for the house specialty, the 45 roasted goat dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Arnulfo's family occupies the camp's thin bourgeois strata-longtime 
residents with regular incomes and small businesses. Like the other natives of 
Guerrero, they live close to the camp's center and look down upon the Mixtec 
Indians from Oaxaca and the handful of recently arrive Guatemalans. operating 
without health permits, restaurant owners like Don Arnulfo generally clear at 
least $300 a week. In addition to selling goat meat to the other restaurants, 
he also charges 50 cents for the use of his blender. With the camp closing, Don 
Arnulfo sees the end of a captive market. "You can't just open a restaurant in 
the city. you need permission. You have to pay rent. It's expensive." Thursday 
is goat-killing day, and a preoccupied Don Arnulfo sits on a faded green and 
gold couch on the restaurant's cooking porch. A chicken pace the dirt floor, 
and a transistor radio plays rancheras and corridas. Dona Asuncion pushes wood 
into the side of the drum to start fire. The goat bucks against the wall of an 
adjacent shack. The butcher hasn't arrived yet and Don Arnulfo, with an 
agitated expression on his large round face, needs to talk. 
</P>
<P>
 "People say the world is going to end this Saturday," he announces. 
</P>
<P>
 Dona Asuncion, dressed in a white knee-length skirt and a yellow T-shirt that 
reads "Released. but not Free" around the likeness of Nelson Mandela, keeps a 
worried eye on the conversation as she throws the gutted and cleaned carcass of 
a quail on the drum stove. "Something is going to crash into the earth, and 
there will be floods and earthquakes." Arnuflfo continues. Dona Asuncion nods 
her head almost imperceptibly to support her husband's statement. "No." I 
explain. "That's another planet. A comet is going to collide with Jupiter." Don 
Arnulfo remains perplexed. Dona Asuncion flips the quail with her bare hand. 
"Jupiter," he asks, "is that far?" "Yes, it's hundreds of millions of miles 
away." "That far. So, there won't be any earthquakes or floods here?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No." "Jupiter. Do people live there?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No" "Gracias a Dios." Thank God. Dona Ascuncion removes the quail, places it 
on a plastic plate and begins heating tortillas. As she flips them with her 
hands, Christauria Welland Akon enters, wearing jeans, sandals and a pink 
T-shirt. "Come in, come in," Arnulfo says, rising from the couch. "It's hot in 
here," says Christauria, her round beatific face red from the heat and the sun. 
As the liaison for Our Lady of Mt. Carmel parish in Rancho Penasquitos, 
Christauria, a cheerful, energetic woman, has the daunting task of serving as 
friend, religious counselor and social worker to the camp. Each summer she and 
her husband take children to the beach and the zoo. "Some of them have never 
seen the ocean." she says, her blue eyes widening. Christauria coordinates the 
weekly chapel services every Saturday morning, organizes the church volunteers 
who serve donated food after mass, schedules baptisms and leads preparation 
classes for First Communions. 
</P>
<P>
 Christauria has come to the goat restaurant to help Dona Asuncion and Don 
Arnulfo plan for the First Communion of their godchild. As padrinos, 
godparents, it is their responsibility to buy the girl's white First Communion 
dress and to make arrangements for the Mass. To consider cost for any of these 
events is bad taste, a cultural sin. A family, compadres and comadres must 
spend lavishly on the celebration so everyone will talk about it for years. "We 
don't know where to get a dress for her." Dona Asuncion says. "It costs more 
here," Christauria replies. "It would be better for you to go to Tijuana, where 
you can find something inexpensive. But if you don't want to go all the way to 
Tijuana, you can go to Escondido. i don't know where they go, but I know they 
go and buy and spend thousands of dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the best," Dona Asuncion insists. "We want the prettiest dress, not 
just any dress." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ah, so you want something that's worth a lot, right? Christauria shakes her 
head. "But why do you spend your money on these things? I just don't understand 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 'Well, it's because we're used to it, it's our custom," Dona Asuncion says. 
"You barely have food and almost no place to live and you all spend hundreds of 
dollars on the dresses for these girls. Explain it to me Perla," Christauria 
says to Dona Asuncion's shy, chubby 16-year-old daughter, who responds with a 
giggle. "Can you explain that to me? For me its a mystery to this very day. I 
don't under stand why a man here hits his wife, and I don't understand why you 
spend so much money for a dress the you'll use for just a little while." 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, it's for people not to say.." Dona Asuncion hesitates. "Well, you see, 
we Mexicans are very nosy, and we gossip a ot. We do it because we do not want 
anyone to say que somos bien codos, that we're stingy." 
</P>
<P>
 "Andale, that's it," Christauria says triumphantly, as if she'd finally 
cornered Dona Asuncion into making the point for her. "Well, these things I 
really don't know about because, although I have more money than you all have, 
I don't spend hundreds of dollars on such things. I don't spend my money that 
way. That's why I have money." "Well, that means you're very stingy then," don 
Arnulfo says, and the family laughs. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday Afternoons, the patch of dirt east of Don Arnulfo restaurant turns 
into a town plaza and business district. Don Jose arrives first, around 3, his 
Chevy Custom pickup weighted down with swap meet goods. He sets up three tables 
and displays ratchet handles, ashtrays from the Ritz-Carlton, garden Gloves, 
bags of marbles, back-support work belts, sued boots, back issue of TV y Novela 
magazines, Spanish-English dictionaries, synthetic silk Partee shirts, bicycle 
patch kits, Palmolive de Lujo, patches, thread, eight-track tapes, aspirin, 
Virgen de Guadalupe T-shirts, porn magazines and key rings that read "I'm in no 
hurry. I'm on my way to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Men trickle in from the fields, their hands red or green from strawberries and 
tomatoes. They line up at Don Trino's truck to cash their checks, which costs a 
dollar on every $100 (the change remains with the cashier). It was not until 
around 1989 that any of them received check stubs, and it was not until then 
that men who were "legal," like Don Cidronio, began to file tax returns. Most 
of the men are illiterate, and they nut around for a stranger to help them sign 
their names on the backs of their names on the backs of their checks. At Rancho 
de los Diablos, when you ask a man his age, he often tells you his age, he 
often tells you his birth year and asks you to figure the rest. At the 
footbridge, Ramiro sells beer from the trunk of car. "Come on, come and get 
them. They're cold. Freshly killed. The beer is dead cold. All you have to do 
is ask for them. i know you're thirsty. come and get em." Across the way, men 
who don't have socks put plastic shopping bags over their feet to try on boots. 
A baby-faced teen buys a green cap that reads "My summer began at Sarah's Bat 
Mitzvah." 
</P>
<P>
 Young men cruise the main strip of the camp in bicycles, pickups and 
motorcycles. An 8-year-old boy sits at the edge of the crowds of drinking men 
and collects their empty cans. When a bag is full, he runs home across the 
creek and returns with an empty bag. A white van that's been converted to an 
ice cream truck chimes "The Entertainer." Half a mile from the camp, las 
viejas, prostitutes from Tijuana, escondido and San Diego, descend in 
skin-tight miniskirts and high hells that puncture the dust. Wobbling down an 
embankment to a stand of eucalyptus tress, they carry their tools in white 
plastic grocery bags: cloth towels and rolls of toile paper.

 With The White Homes of Rancho Penasquitos in the distance, Tlva Medina looks 
like a misplaced angel riding on a clud of dust on her way to her quincianera. 
No one would call her beautiful, and no one would say she was ugly, but in this 
void of plainness, she captures you attention: She is pretty because she has 
grace. Today, the 10th grades at Mount Carmel High School and reads Bambi books 
to practice her English will be the center of the world. she wears a $300 three 
tiered white satin dress with puffed-out sleeves, pink earrings and long satin 
gloves. She lifts her dress so it won't drag through the dust. There, in the 
shade of eucalyptus trees, surrounded by her four escorts, she sits on a 
carpet-covered bench facing a small chapel. built two years ago by Don 
Cidronio, the cement-block sanctuary frames the blue-and white figure of the 
Virgen de Guadalupe.  
</P>
<P>
 A balding priest in a green robe with a round face named Father Fawcett 
celebrates mass. his altar, holding the cruet and hosts, is an overturned 
washing machine covered by a rainbow-colored blanket. Nearby, the stream rushes 
from a small waterfall. As the service continues, little boys throw rocks in 
the water; others run into the woods to pee. Elva's father leans on a tree and 
beams. near the end of the service, her mother, a short woman in a blue and 
with dress, rises from her bench and asks God to protect her daughter as the 
family prepares to leave the camp for the city. Dona Asuncion and Cristobal, 
among the 50 parishioners present, solemly nod their heads. After the aleluya 
and Communion and the presentation of the gold signet ring with ?? number 15 on 
top, a ???? a volunteer invites everyone to stay: "Today we have spaghetti." As 
Elva's father takes pictures of his daughter and friends and people line up for 
food, a white van passes and someone shouts  
</P>
<P>
 "Migra, migra, Border Patrol, Border Patrol." Mouths and forks jerk to a stop. 
False alarm. Everything returns to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the afternoon, the entire camp comes to the party in the clearing 
outside the Carbajal canton and restaurant, a pink structure with a roof made 
from cardboard vegetable boxes and plastic sheets. A blue tarp shades the dirt 
dance floor that's been hosed to keep the dust down. Ramiro sets up speakers, 
microphone and amplifier near the front door. 
</P>
<P>
 Slugging back beers, their heels sinking in the damp dirt, the men form a wall 
around the dance floor. Roughly 12 men for every eligible woman, dozens cue up 
to dance. Some will wait as long as half an hour before they get their chance 
to ask Elva or the others to dance and, when they do, it is with a dash of 
country formality-hat in hand and a brief bow. Elva's uncle asks Ramiro to sing 
a favorite song: 
</P>
<P>
 I wander through life traveling and if you must know, I'll tell you that I'm a 
free spirit, A soul without an owner. I let nothing bother me. for me, life is 
a dream. I drink when I want to-I don't deny it for I am an honest man. I go 
like the seagulls, flying from port to port. I know life is short and that I'm 
in debt. But the day I die, I can't take anything with me. Yes, one has to 
enjoy this life that ends all too soon. Whatever happens in this world, only 
our memories remain. When I'm dead, I can take nothing more than a fistful of 
dirt. 
</P>
<P>
 The children break a pinata with a broom handle, scattering hard candy on the 
ground. Elva's mother calls groups of men into the kitchen to enjoy the pig 
that was killed for the occasion. Dona Asuncion and the older married women sit 
in a row on the edge of the dance floor near a three tiered cake and a few 
boxed of presents. The back of the cake has melted from the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 That afternoon, Don Cidronio, Dona Adelina and their son had packed their 
belonging and moved into a rent-subsidized, two-bedroom duplex in Linda vista, 
30 minutes away. The apartment has a flush toilet and a gas range the first 
that any of them have ever had. halfway through the party, Don Cidronio returns 
and stands at the edge of the crowd, belonging yet somehow gone. It is not that 
he misses the rancho. He returns because it is all he returns because it is all 
he knows of America, so out of whack from the dream. Perhaps he has to return 
before he can accept another version of el norte. 
</P>
<P>
 Princess for a day, Elva medina smiles at the crowd of men who sing "Happy 
Birthday" as she slices into the sagging cake. to the west, blocking the 
falling sun, a rainbow-colored hot air balloon lands in a field. One side 
reads, "Another Beautiful Day in San Diego." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 The First Bulldozers started coming in September. By the first week of 
November, all of Rancho de los Diablos had been razed. Elva and her family now 
live in a new apartment complex in Escondido. Don Arnulfo, Dona Asuncion and 
their family moved to San Diego. Don Cidronio's family continues to live in 
Linda Vista. Felipe, like many of the younger men, went to Alabama to look for 
work in the poultry packing plants where, at $5 an hour, the pay is a little 
better. Ramiro continues to sleep in the back of his car. The other single men, 
who qualified under the relocation program for only one month's rental 
assistance, have decided to take their chances in the hills and valleys. With 
scrap wood from the old camp, they've erected a new camp to the west, closer to 
the Ukegawa fields. They've named it Rancho de los Diablos.
